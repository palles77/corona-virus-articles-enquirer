For the purposes of this chapter, we define a \"signature\" as one or more strings of contiguous genomic DNA or RNA bases sufficient to identify a pathogenic target of interest at the desired resolution and that could be instantiated with particular detection chemistry on a particular platform. The target may be a whole organism, an individual functional mechanism (e.g., a toxin gene), or simply a nucleic acid indicative of the organism. The desired resolution will vary with each program's goals but could easily range from family to genus to species to strain to isolate. Resolution may not be taxonomically based but rather pan-mechanistic in nature: detecting virulence or antibiotic-resistance genes shared by multiple microbes. Entire industries exist around different detection chemistries and instrument platforms for identification of pathogens, and we only briefly mention a few of the techniques that have been used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) to support our biosecurity-related work since 2000. Most nucleic acid-based detection chemistries involve the ability to isolate and amplify the signature target region(s), combined with a technique to detect amplification.",

Mechanism signatures can be best thought of as identifying particular genes that result in functional properties such as virulence, antibiotic resistance, or host range. The primary reason to identify mechanisms, independent of organisms, is to detect potential genetic engineering. A secondary reason is that nature has shared many important mechanisms on its own over the millennia, and thus they may not be sufficiently unique to identify specific organisms. Knowledge of whether a particular isolate has the full virulence kit or possesses unusual antibiotic resistance properties and whether it is human transmissible is important for biodefense and public health responses. Method signatures present yet another dimension of analyzing pathogens: evidence of potential bacterial genetic engineering may be seen in a genome by checking for traces of the bacterial vector(s) that may have been used to insert one or more foreign genes and related components (promoters, etc.) into the genome being modified. In the future, host range signatures might indicate that an otherwise uncharacterized pathogen was potentially capable of evading or defeating the immune system of a particular host organism. ",

More recently the distinction has become blurred because taxonomic distinctions have become less certain and because new signature techniques provide increased resolution levels. Using current commercially available microarray technologies that allow several millions of signatures to be designed on each chip, one can interrogate the entire resolution range (genus, species, strain, and isolate) for desired pathogen targets, providing both detection and forensic resolution.

Obviously, finished genomes are superior to drafts when it comes to performing annotation of gene content or other features, as well as for performing multiple sequence alignments to compare two or more genomes. In our experience at LLNL, an 8-10\ue033 Sanger draft genome provides sufficient information for DNA signature design purposes (1).

One must make an assessment in advance of signature design of how best to subdivide the target sequences. A second approach is to allow degenerate or inosine bases so that a single signature will detect more diverse genomes. Specificity may suffer if some combinations of degenerate bases also pick up nontarget species. Sensitivity may decline, as the specific priming sequence for a given target is diluted in the degenerate mix. A number of tools that require a multiple sequence alignment as input are available for degenerate primer design (e.g., SCPrimer, PrimaClade, Primo, Amplicon, and HYDEN). A third approach is to forego sequence alignment altogether and to look for sets of primer-length oligomers of length k, or \"k-mers,\" present in many targets and unique relative to nontarget sequences. Using combinatoric or greedy algorithms, one can build a signature set of k-mers such that each target contains at least two k-mers to function as forward and reverse primers.

Natural plasmids are extrachromosomal replicons (self-replicating molecules) that come in both circular and linear form and are generally nonessential genetic material for the bacterial host but can confer important phenotypes such as virulence and drug resistance. These plasmids are mobile genetic elements that serve as a natural mechanism for the exchange of genetic material across different bacterial species (8) . Artificial vectors are natural plasmid derivatives designed to improve support for the insertion and manipulation of foreign genetic elements in the carrier plasmid.",

Sequence features designed to support genetic manipulation form the basis for methods used to distinguish artificial vector sequence from natural plasmids. The most common artificial vector-specific feature is the multiple cloning site region, which is a sequence insert containing clusters of restriction enzyme sites used to facilitate insertion of the foreign gene elements. Selection marker genes also play an important role in selecting bacteria, which maintain the artificial vector. The gene transcription control unit, which includes a promoter sequence and transcription terminator sequence for the foreign gene elements, is also an important feature, along with the origin of replication site required for maintenance of the artificial vector in the bacterial colony (9) .",

This suggests use of an assay with a high degree of multiplex capability that tests for the presence of a large number of sequences simultaneously. Microarray-based assays are a logical choice for accommodating a large number of artificial vector detection probes. The large collection of artificial vector sequences can be clustered according to exact k-mer sequence matching to find the k-mers shared among different vector sequences (10) . Sequence length k corresponds to the desired probe length used in the microarray design. Each cluster of shared sequence is compared against all available sequenced natural chromosomal bacterial and viral genomes, including natural plasmids to identify which k-mers in the artificial vector sequence are distinct from the natural background. These unique k-mers are called candidate signatures. After candidate signatures are found, a probe set is created that ensures that each vector contributes a preset minimum number of candidate signatures to the final microarray probe set design. A greedy algorithm can be used to pick signatures shared by the greatest number of artificial vectors, selecting candidate signatures in decreasing order.",

Crossvalidation can be used to estimate a similarity threshold for distinguishing artificial and natural genomic sets.

Confidence in vector detection is boosted when probes are found for multiple functional locations. Using probes from multiple regions may also provide useful forensic information on the origins and function of the detected artificial vector.

Resequencing arrays can provide sequence information for viruses closely related (\ue02e90% similarity) to sequences from which the array was designed. Discovery arrays to detect more diverse and more distantly related organisms have been built using techniques for selecting probes from regions of known conservation based on BLAST nucleotide sequence similarity (15) or profile HMM and motif indications of amino acid sequence conservation (14) . Array design to span an entire kingdom on a single microarray demands substantial investment in probe selection algorithms. LLNL designed a microarray to detect all bacteria, plasmids, and viruses based on all available whole genome, whole segment, and whole plasmid sequences and is in the process of including probes for highly conserved fungal genes as well. We attempted to find probes that are unique to each viral and bacterial family, and favor probes conserved within a family. We used probes 50-65 bases long, enabling sensitive detection of targets with some sequence variation relative to the probe. We used a greedy minimal set cover algorithm to ensure that all sequences have at least 50 (for viruses) or 15 (for bacteria and plasmids) probes per sequence. We allowed some mismatches between probe and target, based on previous mismatch experiments in which we determined that probes with a contiguous match at least 29 bases long and with 85% sequence similarity between probe and target still gave a strong signal intensity. Our design should characterize unknowns to at least the family level, and in all cases tested so far, including blinded clinical samples containing multiple viruses, we are able to accurately detect and characterize all viruses contained in that sample to the species or strain level (16) .",

In recent years the Influenza Community Sequencing Project (17) has deposited many thousands of complete influenza genomes into GenBank, far exceeding the capacity of most tools to handle them. Similarly, some of the new sequencing technologies can generate billions of bases in a single run from metagenomic samples (18) , but truly efficient software that takes full advantage of this information is lacking. It will likely take several years for research funding to be focused properly to close this bioinformatics tool gap. Another aspect of scaling problems is that few researchers have access to computers with large enough memories to be able to process certain classes of sequence analyses related to genomic signature design.

Focusing on biosecurity, we are interested primarily in identifying bacteria, viruses, and fungi that could potentially be used to threaten human, animal, or plant life, to disrupt our economy, or to disturb our social order. Note that there is a wide range of genome sizes involved. Mbp while Bacillus anthracis is about 5 Mbp.) Fungi can range from 10 Mbp to over 700 Mbp. As can be imagined, the sequencing databases have many more viral genomes than bacterial and many more bacterial genomes than fungal. In comparison, the human genome is about 3 Gbp and wheat is about 16 Gbp.",
