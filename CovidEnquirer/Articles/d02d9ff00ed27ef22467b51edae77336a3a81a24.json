            "text": "Biosensors are gradually being used in an increasing number of applications. Heffner (2006) very recently emphasizes that though medical applications still remain the major area of application, biosensors are gradually penetrating a wide variety of non-medical areas. This author indicates that the breadth and depth of biosensor applications has resulted in a 25% increase in the world biosensor market prediction made as early as August 2002 by Kalorama Information for the year 2005 of $2.3 billion to $2.9 billion. The revised estimate was made in the year 2006. Heffner (2006) further indicates that earlier predictions indicated that the medical application was around 90% of the total biosensor market, which includes clinical applications for diabetes, cholesterol, and coagulation monitoring. However, medical applications of biosensors are now down to around 60%. Heffner (2006) attributes these changes to the rapidly advancing technologies and to some serious business challenges. Newman and Setford (2006) in their very recent review of enzymatic biosensors indicate that the biosensor field has expanded dramatically in the last 45 years or so since the first demonstration of a biosensor application in 1962. These authors emphasize that the selfdiagnosis of blood glucose levels by diabetes sufferers, however, still remains the dominant area of biosensor application. In their recent review they provide a historical development of the biosensor field and also provide a commercial perspective.",

For the years 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 , the estimated biosensor market is in dollar billion, 7.79, 8.54, 9.37, and 10.28, respectively . This report analyzes medical biosensors and applications, diabetes and clinical applications, and medical biosensors for artificial organs. The report emphasizes the development of innovative medical biosensor devices that would work as a part of artificial organs such pancreas, liver, or kidney. The report also examines the activities at key biosensor companies, and selected academic centers. Finally, it also provides a future outlook for the development of biosensors. Yurish et al. (2005) have recently analyzed the trends in world sensors and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) markets. These authors emphasize that fixed and durable medical sensors are gradually being replaced by disposable biosensors that cost less and are more hygienic. They indicate that low cost and high volume sales are becoming the key components for remaining competitive in the medical biosensor market. In order to enhance biosensor market penetration into non-medical areas of application, increasing investment is recommended for biosensor R & D (Infoshop.com, 2005; Frost and Sullivan, 2005) . Yurish et al. (2005) cite a Business Communication Company, Inc. (Norwalk, CT, USA) report (RG-116N Fiber Optic Sensors) that the global revenues for fiber optic sensors was projected to be $304.3 million for the year 2006. This was projected to increase by 4.1% to $371.8 million by the year 2010. Fraser (1995) indicated that in 1995 the control of diabetes or the determination of blood glucose levels was the only high-volume market for biosensors. However, even at that time this author indicated that there were opportunities available in a variety of lower volume niches in the medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, and other areas. This author emphasized that the future expansion of biosensor technology would be dictated by a balance between market opportunities and technical and/or financial obstacles. Menon (2004) in a short review on optical biosensors mentions two models of commercial case studies for biosensors. He indicates that the first biosensor was commercialized in 1991. The two models are the razor blade model and the OEM model.",

These strips cost a few cents to make, and sell for 60-75 cents each in boxes of 100 for $ 60-75 (DiabetesStore.com, 2007; Diabetic Test Strips, 2007) . Small Times (2007) emphasizes that these strips are the profit center. It is estimated that there are 12 million diabetics who use these strips eight or more times a day. This means that over close to 100 million strips are used each day in the United States alone. Using the low value of 60 cents per strip this leads to a revenue of $60 million from diabetic strips in the United States alone. The number of diabetics is estimated to climb to 14.5 million by the year 2008 (Diabetic Test Strips, 2007) . The number of diabetics was estimated to be 12 million in the year 2003 (Smalltimes, 2003) . One may anticipate errors in the estimate of the actual number of diabetics made by different authors, nevertheless, the numbers of diabetics is very large, and in all probability, this number is bound to increase due to increasing obesity and poor nutritional intake by quite a large fraction of the population, in general. Diabetic Test Strip (2007) indicated that the sales of diabetic strips was $1.6 billion in the year 2002. In the year 2008 this diabetes glucose monitoring market was estimated to be $3 billion, and is/was expected to climb by 7.2% annually in the year 2003-2008, period.",

Perhaps, under present day circumstances this number could be estimated to be $10 per test. These authors further state that as legislation creates new standards for microbial monitoring, especially after a pathogenic outbreak or two that seems to occur regularly after periodic intervals, there will be pressure to commercialize biosensors for food industry application that are increasingly sensitive to these pathogenic organisms.

This represents a 34.4% increase in about 5 years. Note that, and as expected, the projected estimates for the worldwide biosensor market are different by different authors.

One of the thrusts of this center is nanotemplate-enabled high-rate manufacturing. The intent here is to guide nanobuilding blocks to self-assemble over large areas in highrate, scaleable, commercially viable processes such as injection molding, and extrusion. The authors emphasize that their template process will permit the fabrication of a single carbon nanotube (CNT) electromechanical switch. The authors estimate that the market for these switches at $100 billion. The center has combined with Nantero, a company that manufactures CNT computer memory switches.

Incubators are springing up wherein scholarly research at universities may be gradually turned into or groomed to becoming successful business ventures. The University of Connecticut at Storrs is one such example (UConn Advance, 2005) . Zangari, the executive program director of the Technology Incubator Program (TIP) indicates that the incubator nurtures startup hightech companies. The intent is to bring the University of Connecticut's new ideas to the market place. The incubator provides newly minted entrepreneurs laboratory and office space, and ready access to UConn's facilities and equipment. TIP fits in with the broader perspective of UConn's larger Office of Technology Commercialization. In essence, the TIP program provides enterpreneurs with assistance to get rolling for less than it would cost them to rent office space, etc. Zangari further underscores the importance of the TIP program in that (a) half of small businesses fail within 4 years, and (b) 87% of companies that used the incubator facilities stay within the community.",

This acts as the transducer in the biosensor system, and reduces sample time. The UK company indicates other advantages that include easy and quick sample preparation, can work with milk, plasma, and blood samples, only very small samples are required, and it is very sensitive (for example low femtomole detection of large proteins). Furthermore, the development platform has a low capital as well as a low consumable cost. Besides, the biosensor is able to detect a wide range of low, medium, and high molecular weight analytes. The quantitative results obtained during the detection process may be used for both monitoring and screening applications. Fraser (1995) as early as 1995 indicated that as far as biosensor markets are concerned, there are problems waiting for biosensor solutions. In effect, the future expansion of biosensor markets will depend on the balance between market opportunities and technical/or financial obstacles. A Kalorama Information (2006) (2005) indicates that a few technical problems are slowing down the commercialization of biosensors. These include selectivity, reproducibility, reliability, and the cost of manufacturing. These types of considerations not only delay new product launches but also prevent the large-scale production of a wide variety of newly developed biosensors. This author emphasizes that the manufacturing aspects need to be streamlined. Miniaturization and the application of nanotechnology and nanobiotechnology principles should assist the biosensor field to make inroads into hitherto untapped areas of application. These authors emphasize that the high costs of R&D for a new biosensor remains significantly high (around $40-50 million, and involves 8-10 years development time). This coupled with the lack of financial support for these types of endeavors limits the development of biosensor to larger companies, and excludes the smaller ones. Smaller companies (less than 50 personnel perhaps; an arbitrary number) can, however, develop biosensors in niche and specialized areas of application (Business Wire, 2005).",

Fortunately, however, this author indicates that due to similarities in the detection of pathogens and human diseases, and for environmental applications, some of the technical know how and resources may be diverted from these types of areas where regulatory approval is not a strict as is for human application. It is important to point out that for medical purposes, at least, the newer products (biosensors) must go through developmental as well as regulatory steps (or process).",

The company plans to develop a low cost, simple to use, reusable biosensor reader that uses a disposable biosensor chip to detect a wide variety of harmful analytes in a fluid system. The size of the biosensor is to be like a personal digital assistant (PDA). The company's research is at the interface of molecular engineering, analytical chemistry, and biology. Applied Nanotech, Inc. a subsidiary of Nano-Proprietary, Inc. (Applied Nanotech, Inc., 2006) indicates that miniaturized enzymatic biosensors are in demand in the medical, environmental, and chemical analysis arena. They emphasize that the rapid commercialization of biosensors is hindered by cost, manufacturing complexity, and single use of a specific analyte. Besides, the sensitivity of the analyte to be detected is limited by the substrate that the enzyme is immobilized on. This company has developed a miniaturized biosensor array based on enzyme-coated nanotubes (ECNT). They indicate that their ECNT tongue can analyze quite a few analytes from a single drop of blood, urine, or saliva for metabolic analysis. They also emphasize that their sensor manufacturing process is scaleable to produce hundreds of sensors on a miniaturized chip.",

Tormey (2007) in a guest editorial entitled, \"New economics drive product development in biotech\" indicates that specialization in design and manufacturing has changed the product design and development business. He indicates that specialized, smaller, and leaner design and manufacturing units provide companies with economies of scale that they cannot achieve by themselves. These smaller specialized manufacturing companies may provide a significant time-to-market advantage.

One biosensor is based on magnetic particles (for magnetic biosensors), and the other is based on Raman spectroscopy (for optical biosensors).

The company is also looking at developing a disposable biosensor that would be manufactured at low cost. This is for possible use in a hand-held reader.",

This is possible if one has very sensitive biosensors to be able to detect the relevant biomarkers for the different diseases.

The CMPND center has an on-going program for the use of conjugates of biomolecules and nanoparticles or conductive polymers for biosensors and lab-on-a-chip devices. This center indicates that for the future of health care low-cost and highly sensitive biosensors and lab-on-a-chip devices are essential. This center further states that the present-day biosensors that rely on optical and radiation methods are either too expensive or are not sensitive enough for single-molecule detection and analysis. In order to facilitate single-molecule analysis, the CMPND center plans to use nanoparticles and conductive polymers to form conjugates with biomolecules for advanced proteomic biosensing applications. The CMPND center is also exploring ligand-protein-nanofiber interactions with the eventual goal of developing high-performance electrical signal based biosensors for the early detection of chemical and biological agents.",

Except for the monitoring of sugar levels in diabetic patients (which is a huge market, and it is increasing due to the rise in obesity levels in individuals worldwide coupled with poor food and exercise habits), biosensors are finding it difficult to make any major headway in other possible areas of application. This is in spite of the fact that they can be of tremendous use to diagnose early quite a few intractable and insidious autoimmune diseases, for example. Needless to say, quite a few of these diseases may be managed better if they were diagnosed during their early stages of incidence.",

Hopefully in the not to distant future with advances in biosensor technology, and in nanotechnology, especially the manufacturing aspects, and the lessons that the companies and the individuals have learned in bringing biosensors (successfully or even unsuccessfully) to the market will all come together in the future to let companies make reasonable amounts of profit by manufacturing and marketing biosensors for different areas of application.
