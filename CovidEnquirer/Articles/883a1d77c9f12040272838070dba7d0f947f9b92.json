The strains are named in this way due to their respective homologies to types II and I feline coronavirus (FCoV) (Herrewegh et al., 1998) . Infection may occur with a single strain, however mixed infections with both types appear to be common (Decaro et al., 2005) .

Demographic and clinical data was obtained for each of the samples, including signalment, number of dogs in the household, reason for visiting the practice, and any recent history of diarrhoea. The samples were tested by RT-PCR for the presence of both type I and type II CECoV. Seven samples were positive (three from dogs in the same household), a prevalence of 2.8% (95% confidence intervals 1.1-5.7). Phylogenetic analysis of partial M gene sequences revealed that all seven positive samples grouped with type I CECoV, the first report of this virus in the UK. None of the positive dogs presented for gastrointestinal disease. Interestingly five of the positive dogs from three separate households were aged over 6 years, suggesting that older dogs may play an important role in the persistence of CECoV in such populations.",

In diarrhoeic dogs the prevalence of CECoV by RT-PCR has been reported to range from 15% to 42% in pet dogs (Bandai et al., 1999; Pratelli et al., 2000; Yesilbag et al., 2004) and up to 73% in kennelled dogs (Sokolow et al., 2005) . There is little data on the prevalence of CECoV infection in dogs without enteric disease, and what is available is based on virus isolation, which can only detect type II CECoV, or electron microscopy, which is relatively insensitive (Tennant et al., 1993; Schulz et al., 2008) . This leaves a significant gap in our understanding of the epidemiology of this disease in the dog population as a whole.

This contrasts with a more recent study in which a prevalence of 17.5% was detected by electron microscopy in 200 healthy dogs in Germany (Schulz et al., 2008) .

There are a number of possible reasons why relatively few diarrhoeic dogs were positive for CECoV in our study. Mild diarrhoea in dogs is very often non-infectious in origin and in some cases may simply be a natural sequel to dietary indiscretion.

No type II CECoV was identified from any of the samples in this study, although the same assay has been successfully used in our laboratory to detect both types I and II CECoV in other samples from UK dogs. There is some suggestion that type I CECoV may be shed at higher titres and for a longer period than type II, and if this is indeed the case this could lead to an enhanced probability of detecting type I CECoV in a cross-sectional study of this kind (Decaro et al., 2005) . Type 1 CECoV virus was first described in 2003 in Italy (Pratelli et al., 2003b) and has since been reported in other countries (Yesilbag et al., 2004; Rennhofer et al., 2005) . Recent evidence, based on the discovery of a new open reading frame present in type I CECoV (Lorusso et al., 2008a; Stavisky et al., 2008) , with residual fragments in type II CECoV, and the closely related feline coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, suggests that type I CECoV may actually represent the ancestral virus of this group (Lorusso et al., 2008b) .",

Although classic CECoV infection is considered to cause only mild enteric disease (Tennant et al., 1991) , there are several reports where type II CECoV has been associated with more severe haemorrhagic diarrhoea and occasional death (Binn et al., 1974; Buonavoglia et al., 2006; Zappulli et al., 2007) . It has also been suggested that such signs can be seen with type I (Benetka et al., 2006) . Since more virulent strains appear to evolve spontaneously (Decaro et al., 2008; Zappulli et al., 2007) , it may be that both types I and II have the ability to cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, and this variation in virulence may depend on both viral evolution and host factors such as age and immune status. Further 6 . Faeces spiked with CECoV-C54 were kept at room temperature for a number of days and then underwent RT-PCR using the protocol described. It can be seen that even after 7 days a faint band was visible at the \u00c03 dilution, suggesting a loss in titre of less than 10-fold. work is needed on different populations of dogs to help clarify this.",

Electron microscopy is relatively insensitive, and serological assays are based on type II CECoV, which limits their use as they have unknown efficacy in detecting type I. In addition, since seroprevalence in the general dog population is relatively high, such tests are difficult to interpret in relation to diagnosing acute disease unless paired samples are taken. The efficacy of currently available CECoV vaccines, which are all based on type II CECoV, is also unclear. The only data on crossprotection available to date is based on in vitro work and suggests that the level of antigenic cross-reactivity between the two types may be limited . Clearly, this should also be assessed in challenge experiments in vivo.",
