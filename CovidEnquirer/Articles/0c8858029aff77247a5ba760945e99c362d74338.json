In addition, 28 teachers and students in the Northeast Agricultural University of China were infected with Brucella spp. in 2010 [2] . In addition, the bacterium that causes anthrax escaped from a laboratory in USA in 2014 [3] . These laboratory-associated infections have increased global concern for laboratory biosafety [4] , and have prompted many countries, including China, to reexamine and revise the relevant laws and regulations for laboratory biosafety, to facilitate the effort to propose appropriate countermeasures.",

Here, we summarize the regulations and standards currently in place in China, and propose control strategies. The Regulation of Pathogenic Microorganism Laboratory Biological Safety (issued by the State Council of the People's Republic of China) [5] is the primary mandated regulation in China for the management of laboratory biosafety and pathogenic microorganisms. The Directory of Pathogenic Microorganisms Transmitted in Humans, issued by the Ministry of Health in China in 2006, specify the grade of laboratory in which specific pathogens and animals should be housed [6] . The Standards include the general laboratory requirements for biosafety [7] and the architectural and technical code for laboratory biosafety [8] . These provide national guidelines and standards for the construction, operation, and management of biosafety laboratories in China.",

When staff handle these animals during activities such as feeding, cage changing, blood collection, and anatomical examinations, bio-aerosols may be generated. In order to reduce bio-aerosol loads in indoor environments, certain control measures should be followed [21] . These include proper identification and elimination of the microbial source in occupational settings, maintenance of equipment, humidity control, use of filters in ventilation, and air cleaning using disinfectants and biocides. The air in operating rooms and other critical areas, such as isolation rooms, can be disinfected by fumigation. In addition, an adequate air change rate and installation of filtration equipment are necessary [22] .",

Wedum [25] reported that more than 65% of all laboratory-associated infections are caused by aerosols containing microbes. Pedrosa [26] [27] showed that 84% of laboratory arbovirus infections are caused by aerosols.

The pressure in the core experimental area must be negative [7] . In addition, there should be a pressure gradient between the housing room and any 'dirty' corridors [8] . Housing rooms should contain a buffer unit with biosafety cabinets, in which researchers can perform experiments, in order to control aerosols efficiently. The main devices in ABSL-2 facilities should include individual ventilated cages (IVC) for rats and mice, negative housing cabinets for rabbits and dogs, and isolators for poultry. The animal experiment equipment should include a negative pressure autopsy table, a disinfection sterilizer, biosafety cabinets, centrifuges, independent ventilation animal transport cages, and independent ventilation recovery cages. Other devices may include a cage changing work bench, cleaning equipment, and a hydrogen peroxide generator [30] .",

A properly designed and functional HVAC system is essential to provide adequate pressure, temperature, and humidity. Pressurization contributes to controlling airborne contamination by providing directional airflow. Areas for quarantine, housing, and use of animals exposed to pathogenic microorganisms, and areas for housing nonhuman primates should be kept at negative pressure, whereas areas for clean equipment storage should be kept at positive pressure. The HVAC system should be designed for reliability (and redundancy, if applicable), ease of maintenance, and energy conservation and be able to meet the requirements of all animals housed. The system should also be adjustable and ideally maintain temperatures of \u00b11 \u00b0C. Relative humidity should generally be maintained within a range of 40%-70% throughout the year [29] . Although maintenance of humidification within a limited range over extended periods is extremely difficult, daily fluctuations (recognizing the effects of routine husbandry especially when caring for large animal species) in relative humidity should be minimized. Ideally, relative humidity should be maintained within \u00b110% of the set point. However, this may not be achievable under some circumstances. The type and efficiency of supply and exhaust air treatment should be matched to the quantity and type of contaminants and to the risks they pose. Overall, the principles for selection of the HVAC should be reliability, longevity, and minimal energy consumption.",

It should be noted that routine physical examinations are inadequate for effective evaluation, and that microbial aerosol technology is the most direct and specific technique for biological detection of airflow and HEPA filters [31] [32] . While the HAVC system runs, the HEPA filter will collect particulates. The capacity of the building supply and the exhaust fan determine the life of a HEPA filter. When the HAVC can no longer maintain a proper airflow balance due to filter loading, the filters need to be replaced. If any filter shows visible signs of damage or leakage, it should be repaired or replaced immediately.",

When sharps, such as needles or glass, must be used, operations should be performed carefully to avoid any injury. Researchers must strictly obey the standard operation procedures when working with infectious agents. The protective performance of the biosafety cabinets should be assessed regularly.

Sentinel animals are externally sourced animals that are introduced into a population, exposed to animals or soiled bedding from the population, and sampled in lieu of the principal animals. Most commonly, sentinel animals are indirectly exposed to infectious agents by using dirty bedding. The use of direct contact sentinels is a valuable complement, particularly in certain sensitive situations such as quarantine. Bedding sentinel animals are the current standard practice for surveillance of isolated ventilated cages or when animals to be monitored are immunodeficient and there are no immunocompetent resident animals available. If sentinel animals are bred in an ABSL-2 facility, they should be monitored at an increased frequency, perhaps monthly, as they are a potential source of infection for the entire facility. Sentinel animals should be chosen and placed with a variety of criteria in mind. Sentinels should be immunocompetent so that they are suitable subjects for serology, and should have a mature immune system when sampled. Sentinels should be introduced to the colony at 3-5 weeks of age. Sentinels should be female, which will decrease fighting and lessen the chance of genetic contamination of the resident animals. Sentinel animals should also be demonstrably free of all infectious agents that would be of concern in the area that they are chosen to monitor.",

An effective occupational health program screens those with animal contact in order to identify individuals who may be particularly susceptible to animal allergens or the infectious disease under study, or who may present an elevated risk to the animals. This medical evaluation, which is part of the individual's medical record, must be private and confidential. Training should be tailored to the group in question. It is also prudent to provide additional training to cover risks or hazards faced by animal handlers even if it is not mandated by regulation. Examples of training programs in this category include ergonomics and slips, trips or falls, effective use of the biosafety cabinet or chemical fume hood, safe handling of sharps, sterilization/disinfection, and an emergency response program. Employees must also receive training for the use of any equipment that may involve risk or present a hazard to the employee, such as autoclaves, rack washers, containment equipments, ventilated caging systems, and precision vaporizers used by researchers. An individual who has never worked with infected animals should demonstrate proficiency with the required biosafety work practices and the institution's peer-review standard operating procedures (SOP) with noninfectious animals before proceeding to practice sessions with infected animals. Selection and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential to avoid infections in an animal laboratory. PPE appropriate for the work environment, including clean institution-issued protective clothing, should be provided as often as necessary. Emergency protocols should be established so that employees can protect themselves and the animals.",
