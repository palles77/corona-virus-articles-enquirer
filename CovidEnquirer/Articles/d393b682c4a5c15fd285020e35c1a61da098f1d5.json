Here we demonstrate that a novel DNA vaccine expressing a modified V antigen (LcrV) of Y. pestis, with a human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal sequence, elicited strong V-specific antibody responses in BALB/c mice. This tPA-V DNA vaccine protected mice from intranasal challenge with lethal doses of Y. pestis. In comparison, a DNA vaccine expressing the wild type V antigen was much less effective. Only tPA-V formed oligomers spontaneously, and elicited a higher IgG2a anti-V antibody response in immunized mice, suggesting increased T H 1 type cellular immune response. Our data indicate that antigen engineering is effective in inducing high quality protective immune responses against conformationally sensitive antigens. These results support that optimized DNA vaccines have the potential to protect against bacterial pathogens than is generally recognized.",

In nature, Y. pestis is endemic in rodent populations in many parts of the world. It is transmitted primarily via the bite of infected fleas, causing bubonic plague, a disease characterized by grossly swollen lymph nodes (buboes). While Y. pestis-based weapons used during the World War II employed flea-based transmission, direct infection of humans via aerosols is thought to be the most likely and most dangerous mode of delivery which will produce the pneumonic plague. In contrast to bubonic plague, pneumonic plague progresses more rapidly, is highly transmissible via droplets to mucosal surface, and requires extremely prompt therapeutic intervention. Unless appropriate antimicrobial therapy is instituted with 24 h of the onset of symptoms, this disease is uniformly fatal. These features of pneumonic plague, coupled with the potential use of antibiotic resistant Y. pestis, argue strongly for the development of vaccines effective in preventing mucosal transmission of Y. pestis as a tool in biodefense.",

There is a killed whole cell (KWC) plague vaccine licensed in certain parts of the world [1], but other discontinued KWC plague vaccine was shown not effective in protecting against pneumonic plague in small animal studies [2, 3] . Certain recombinant protein vaccines in advanced stages of development have been demonstrated to provide various levels of protection against pneumonic plague in animal models. These vaccines utilize one or both of two known protective antigens, Fraction 1 (F1) and LcrV (V). The F1 protein forms a capsule [4] and is believed to confer resistance to phagocytosis, possibly by forming aqueous pores in the membranes of phagocytic cells [5] or by interfering with complement-mediated opsonization [6] . F1 has been shown to be an effective vaccine component [7] [8] [9] . Since mutant Y. pestis strains unable to produce F1 antigen remain highly virulent, reliance on F1 as a protective vac-cine antigen may be unwise. Identification of new protective antigens is needed to make improved multi-component plague vaccines.",

The necessary plasmid constructs can be quickly produced and no purification of protein is required since the antigens encoded by the DNA vaccines are expressed in vivo. This allows rapid screening and optimization of many alternative antigens based on immunogenicity and protection data collected from animal studies. Significant improvements have been made in recent years in DNA vaccine technology and several DNA-based vaccines have entered into early phase clinical trials [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, major effort in DNA vaccine studies so far has been directed against pathogenic viruses. Like actual viral infections, the proteins encoded by DNA vaccines are expressed within host cells and hence are available for presentation via the Class I Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) pathway to elicit viral antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. The development of DNA vaccines against bacterial pathogens has been explored less thoroughly, perhaps because protective immunity to most bacterial infections is thought to be heavily dependent on humoral immune responses. Although the ability of DNA vaccines to generate specific antibody is well documented, the potential of DNA vaccines to induce protective levels of antibody responses against acute bacterial infections has just begun to be recognized [20] .",

Our previous DNA vaccine studies against other infectious agents have demonstrated that a proper leader sequence was important in inducing high level antibody responses by increasing soluble antigen production in mammalian cell systems [23] [24] [25] [26] . In particular, we have described a molecular approach to enhance the secretion and thus the immunogenicity of the HIV-1 gp120 antigen by linking the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence to the N terminus of the gp120 protein [23, 24, 27] . Since LcrV gene does not encode a typical signal peptide, the focus of this study was to determine if the immunogenicity of an LcrV-based DNA vaccine could be improved when engineered to include the signal sequence from tPA. We report here that this vaccine design was able to elicit high level anti-V antibody responses protecting mice from lethal doses of Y. pestis in an intranasal challenge model. Interestingly, this tPA-V antigen had a strong tendency to form oligomers as examined by the in vitro expression system. Data presented in this study confirmed the importance to include LcrV component in a multigene plague DNA formulation. Our study further demonstrated that the F1 DNA vaccine provided much lower protection and the Pla DNA vaccine was not protective in its current designs.",

The rises of anti-V antibody responses with time were further analyzed (Fig. 2b) . The tPA-V DNA vaccine was able to induce a sharp increase in antibody response following a single immunization while the wt-V DNA vaccine required at least two immunizations to produce a response of the similar level (Fig. 2b) . No significant anti-Pla IgG antibody responses were detected from animals immunized with either wt-Pla or tPA-Pla DNA vaccines (Fig. 2a) . The poor immunogenicity of Pla DNA vaccines may be the result of low level expression of Pla.

Animals that received vector control DNA or Pla DNA plasmids quickly developed easily observable signs of sickness, such as rough coats, hunched or huddled posture, shivering, labored breathing and lethargy, within the first 24-36 h post-challenge and most of them died within three to four days (Fig. 3) . Three DNA vaccines, wt-F1, tPA-F1 and wt-V, provided partial protection with 50-75% animal surviving after 2 weeks' observation (Fig. 3) . Animals survived in these partially protected groups usually had only transient and minor signs of sickness, with decreased grooming which lasted for 3-5 days. On the other hand, the tPA-V DNA vaccine provided 100% protection in this initial study (Fig. 3) . Most significantly, animals in this group showed no sign of sickness and remained active during the entire two weeks.",

After confirming the positive anti-V antibody responses by ELISA in these DNA immunized animals (data not shown), the fourth DNA immunization is given at week 16 and the animals were challenged two weeks later. Three intranasal challenge doses were given to both vaccine groups. As shown in Fig. 4 , survival was substantially better for the tPA-V vaccinated mice at all three challenge dose levels, 90%, 80% and 70% for challenge doses of 5000 cfu (15 LD 50 ), 20,000 cfu (60 LD 50 ), and 80,000 cfu (240 LD 50 ) respectively, than the animals received the wt-V DNA vaccines (20% survival for all three challenge doses). Table 1 summarized the results for both challenge studies. The differences in survival between tPA-V and wt-V were statistically significant (P = 0.0055 and P = 0.023 for the first two challenge doses (5000 cfu and 20,000 cfu), based on the Fisher's exact test). The third challenge does (80,000 cfu) was less significant (P = 0.0698) due to the relatively small sampling sizes. Combining the data from all three challenge doses, the survival rate for tPA-V immunized animals was 80% compared with 20% survived for wt-V DNA immunized animals. Again, none of the control animals survived even at the lowest challenge dose of 5000 cfu (Fig. 4 and Table 1 ).",

The level of antibody produced by the tPA-V construct was comparable to that reported for the most effective protein vaccine formulations containing LcrV [35] . Moreover, the protection afforded by the tPA-V DNA vaccine is comparable to that reported for LcrV protein-based vaccines [35, 36] , and only moderately inferior to that reported for two-component F1+V protein formulations tested against Y. pestis in mouse respiratory infection models. Previous study using LcrV protein alone reported 80% protection at 590 LD 50 [35] and an LcrV-F1 fusion protein induced 100% protection at the same challenge dose [35] , compared to the 70% protection observed with tPA-V at our highest challenge dose of 240 LD 50 . With a two-component LcrV+F1 formulations, 100% protection was achieved against 100 LD 50 [2] , and another study reported 100% protection against 10 4 LD 50 with LcrV+F1 subunit vaccine [3] , reflecting the variation in different experimental systems. While aerosol infections were used for pneumonic plaque in these studies, we used the intranasal route. Both routes could yield acute pneumonia and rapid development of systemic infection, and they appeared to produce compatible LD 50 values in a given mouse strain with similar mean time to death. Given these similarities in the pattern of disease, it is unlikely that the challenging route has a major influence on the outcome of these protection studies.",

As shown in our results, the tPA leader in the tPA-V construct enhanced protein production, and resulted LcrV antigen with modified structure features as indicated by its tendency to form oligomers. Oligomers of LcrV antigen have been associated with enhanced immunogenicity, and was observed in protein-based V formulations [30] . Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of why tPA-V construct had a stronger tendency to form oligomeric V than the wt-V construct, but the leader sequence may affect the folding of a secreted protein as previously reported [37] .",

            "text": "In addition, tPA-V induced a 10-fold greater level of IgG2a responses than wt-V, indicating an enhanced T H 1-type preference. LcrV was recently reported to in-duce high levels of IL-10 production through a mechanism that involved direct interaction of LcrV and TLR-2 [38] . The importance of this effect in vivo has yet to be firmly established, and there is no data concerning its effect on the development of LcrV-specific immunity. Given the fact that IL-10 inhibits T H 1-type immune responses, it is likely that tPA-V may be less effective than wt-V in inducing IL-10-perhaps due to a reduced ability to interact with TLR-2-resulting in a bias toward a more effective T H 1-type response against Y. pestis. While the basis for the enhanced immunogenicity and protection afforded by tPA-V is not the focus of the current study, mechanisms mentioned above may contribute in concert and further study is needed to examine the exact process that tPA-V induced better protection.",

Addition of the tPA leader to F1 did not improve the levels of protection. This is not surprising given the fact that the F1 native signal sequence supports secretion, and our finding is consistent with other experiments in which addition of an extra signal sequence to the wild type F1 gene did not improve the immunogenicity of F1 DNA vaccines [32] . In our study, DNA vaccines expressing Pla antigen did not provide any protection. The Pla gene has an unusual hydrophobic sequence near its N-terminus that may be responsible for the poor expression of soluble Pla antigens, and thus the poor immunogenicity of Pla DNA vaccines. It will be interesting to see if the Pla antigen can achieve a better protection when the N-terminal hydrophobic sequence is removed.",

            "text": "Our results indicate that properly designed DNA vaccines can offer effective protection against highly virulent extracellular bacterial pathogens. Such vaccines can be used not only alone, but also as a component in a DNA prime plus protein boost formulation. Such a combination can offer many advantages over more conventional single modality vaccines because DNA and protein are individually effective in inducing different sets of immune responses. Protein-based vaccines are effective in inducing high antibody responses, but multiple inoculations and strong adjuvants are usually required. Using DNA components in the priming phase can significantly reduce the amount of protein needed for the boost, or decrease the numbers of protein immunizations required to induce the same level of protective immune responses. DNA is also more stable and easier to manufacture than the recombinant proteins. DNA vaccines have been proven to be extremely safe in all the clinical studies conducted to date. The ease of modification of the encoded antigens and expression of conformation-sensitive antigens in vivo, circumventing the lengthy and expensive process of in vitro protein production, are important advantages offered by DNA vaccine technology. Particularly in light of emerging infectious diseases and the threat of bioterrorism, where the rapid development of robust vaccines may become a fre-quent requirement, the potential of DNA vaccines against bacterial pathogens warrants more thorough investigation.",
