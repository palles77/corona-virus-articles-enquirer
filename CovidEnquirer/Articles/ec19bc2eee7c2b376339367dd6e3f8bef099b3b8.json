By whole exome sequencing, we unraveled the presence of pathogenic variants affecting genes already known to be involved in DBA pathogenesis (RPL5 and RPS19) in three patients with otherwise uncertain clinical diagnosis, and provided new insights on DBA genotype-phenotype correlations. Remarkably, the RPL5 c.482del frameshift mutation has never been reported before, whereas the RPS19 c.3GN T missense mutation, although previously described in a 2-month-old DBA patient without malformations and refractory to steroid therapy, was detected here in the mosaic state in different bodily tissues for the first time in DBA patients.",

Importantly, it is argued that some DBA patients who present with craniofacial malformations and absent or very mild hematological abnormalities are underdiagnosed. The vast majority (~90%) of affected individuals typically present symptoms during the first year of life or in early childhood, even if non-classical mild phenotypes may not be diagnosed until later in life [5, 6] . Although most DBA cases are sporadic, about 20% of patients have a positive family history with autosomal dominant inheritance [7] . Except for the rare germline GATA1 (Xp11.23, OMIM 300835) and TSR2 (Xp11.22, OMIM 300946) mutations, inherited in an X-linked manner [8, 9] , most of the DBA causative mutations have been identified in genes encoding ribosomal proteins (RP) of the 40S or 60S ribosomal subunits [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Nevertheless, the underlying molecular defect remains unknown in approximately half of DBA patients currently analyzed by conventional screening techniques (e.g. direct sequencing), drawing attention to the need for highthroughput sequencing approaches [19, 20] .",

The array-CGH analysis revealed a small deletion on Xq13.3, spanning about 54 Kb (chrX:74,772,380-74,826,260, GRCh37/hg19), in the proband (Supplementary Fig. S1A ). This chromosomal alteration, not reported in the Database of Genomic Variants (http://dgv.tcag.ca), was located within a region devoid of genes and the closest coding gene (~29 Kb), ZDHHC15 (chrX:74,588,262-74,743,337, GRCh37/hg19), was associated with a different phenotype (severe X-linked mental retardation, seizures and early childhood obesity, OMIM 300577) and, thus, not considered as pathogenic [37] . Moreover, Sanger sequencing analysis of the RPS19 gene, which accounts for approximately 25% of DBA cases [38] , failed to Table 1 List of candidate variants in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA), Fanconi Anemia (FA) and Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC)-associated genes detected in families A and B. RPL5 and RPS19 genes segregated with the disease in the two families. SLX4, FANCA, ATR and RTEL1 variants in family B were discarded because of the heterozygous state or overall neutral effect. TERT c.835GNA change was reported in ClinVar but was shown not to segregate with the disease [46] . The presence of compound heterozygous mutations was also excluded. (Fig. 1) . This loss of function (LoF) mutation, affecting a highly conserved position (PhyloP:4.24; PhastCons:1.00), was subsequently validated by traditional Sanger sequencing approach in DNA samples from available family members to determine whether the candidate variant co-segregated with the DBA phenotype within the pedigree. Parental DNA examination revealed that the mutation was inherited from the mother. Further molecular analysis of the maternal grandparents, who did not show any symptom, confirmed that the mutation occurred de novo in the patients' mother (Fig. 1) . The variant created a frameshift at codon 161 resulting in a premature stop codon two positions downstream and, according to in silico predictions, the mRNA produced was expected to be degraded through nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD).",

Accordingly, the NGS data were filtered considering different panels of genes involved in these hematologic diseases (Supplementary Table S1 ). The preliminary filtering process for FA and DC-associated genes (according to the initial clinical diagnosis) did not unveil any disease-causing variant, either for predicted in silico overall neutral effect or for inconsistent inheritance pattern (Table 1) . On the contrary, after filtering of variants for DBA-associated genes, we obtained a unique heterozygous missense variant (NM_001022.3:c.3G N T; NP_001013.1:p.Met1?), in the exon 2 of RPS19 of patient II-1 (Fig. 2) . This substitution, leading to the loss of the highly conserved translation initiation codon (PhyloP:5.13; PhastCons:1.00), was predicted to be damaging by almost all the in silico tools (Table 1 ). An alternative in-frame start codon was not present around the mutated position, as assessed by ORF Finder and StarORF, although the contribution of alternative translation initiation signals (TISs) might also be considered [39] . Moreover, this variant was reported in HGMD (#CM005392) and dbSNP142 (rs138938035, with a frequency of the minor T allele of 0.7% in the population), and previously reported as causative [40] . Other two missense mutations in the initial methionine codon (c.1ANG and c.2TN A) were described in large cohorts of DBA patients without malformations, growth retardation and steroid response [24, 41] . As assessed by IGV visual inspection, the c.3GN T transversion showed variation in allele fraction in our patient (G:70%, T:30% with read depth of 84\u00d7), thus suggesting mosaicism. This unbalanced allelic ratio was further confirmed by both Sanger sequencing and quantitative pyrosequencing assays in blood as well as buccal swab and urine specimens ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). While a de novo germline mutation is typically associated with an allelic ratio of approximately 50%, the observed lower ratio suggested that the mutation more likely arose during embryogenesis. Accordingly, the mutation was absent in the parental DNA samples. Finally, any pathogenic copy number variation (CNV) was detected in the proband, as assessed by the EXCAVATOR's data analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S1B ).",

Moreover, the missense c.3GNT mutation, even if previously reported, was here detected in a mosaic state. To our knowledge, mosaic point mutations have never been reported in DBA patients. Previously, Farrar et al. [45] described three DBA individuals with mosaic copy loss on chromosomes 3q and 15q, containing two well-established DBA genes, RPL35A (3q29) and RPS17 (15q25.2). Interestingly, the two patients with low-level mosaicism experienced a spontaneous remission of DBA in the second decade of life, whereas the subject with a higher fraction of mosaicism remained transfusion-dependent. These findings suggest that the fraction of blood mosaicism may correlate with the prognosis and may also impact on the clinical outcome of our young patient with a mosaic RPS19 missense mutation.",

(A, B) Picture of patient III-1, showing transparent skin, high forehead, flattened occiput, widow's peak, deep-set eyes, downward-slanting palpebral fissures, and small mouth. (C) Hands of patient III-1. The boy presented short 5th fingers, especially at the right, mild clinodactyly, and apparently short distal phalanges. (D) Picture of patient III-2 at age 7 months, showing pale transparent skin, high forehead with hemangioma at the left, widow's peak, ocular hypertelorism, mild epicanthus inversus, deep-set eyes, low nasal bridge, and \"tented\" small mouth. (E) Patient III-2's feet with cutaneous syndactyly of digits IV-V (especially on left foot), broad halluces, and hypoplasia of the distal phalanges (mostly of 4th and 5th toes at the left).
