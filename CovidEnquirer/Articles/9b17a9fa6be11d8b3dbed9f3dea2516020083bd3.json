With the rapid increase in data files generated by next generation sequencing, existing tools for identifying and annotating viruses and phages in metagenomics samples suffer from expensive running time. In this paper, we developed a standalone pipeline, FastViromeExplorer, for rapid identification and abundance quantification of viruses and phages in big metagenomic data. Both real and simulated data validated FastViromeExplorer as a reliable tool to accurately identify viruses and their abundances in large data, as well as in a time efficient manner.",

Even in a healthy human body, there are estimated to be 100 times more viral particles than eukaryotic cells [7] . Studies have shown that there are connections between human gut microbiome (viruses and bacteria) and diseases such as diabetes [6] and depression [8] and cancer [31] . Moreover, recent emerging viral outbreaks including Zika outbreak in Brazil [3] , Ebola in West Africa [4, 9] , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [10] , SARS, influenza-A caused tens of thousands of human deaths. To better understand and eventually prevent such viral outbreaks, it is critical to have timely identification and annotation of viruses. Traditional techniques of virus identification rely on isolation and clone culturing, which is not only time-consuming but often infeasible as many viruses and their hosts are difficult to cultivate in laboratories. Thanks to the fast development of biotechnology, it is now easy and quick to produce metagenomics data for a direct analysis of genetic materials to identify viruses and their abundances in various environments [11] .",

            "text": "However, with the ease of metagenomics data generation also comes the challenge of downstream data analysis, including the computational identification of viral species and their abundances in a fast yet accurate manner from hundreds of millions/billions of short sequences. Strategies to identify and annotate viruses vary among different tools, ranging from analyzing marker genes, binning sequences or reads into taxonomic groups, assembling sequences into contigs and then annotating the taxonomy using the contigs, to directly aligning short reads to a reference database and inferring virus types and abundances based on the alignment results. The most straightforward and fastest approach for virus taxonomic annotation is to align short reads to a marker gene database and identify viruses based on the alignments, for example, MetaPhlAn [26] and its updated version MetaPhlAn2 [29] use this approach. However, marker gene analysis strategy does not work well when the input data contain species that do not have known marker genes. Comparatively, assembling reads into longer contigs and then performing the taxonomic analysis with contigs tend to produce more accurate results [21] . This type of virus analysis pipelines normally requires the users to assemble the reads using an independent assembler and then annotates the assembled contigs (e.g., VirSorter [22] , Metavir [23] , Metavir2 [24] , and Virome [30] ). Understandably the assembly of short reads into contigs gives longer sequences including longer coding regions with more informative content, which leads to improved annotation and downstream analysis. However, read assembly can be very time-consuming for large metagenomics data and can also generate chimeras (i.e., sequences from different genomes that are incorrectly assembled together due to their similarity) that mislead downstream annotation. Finally, tools such as MG-RAST [16] , ViromeScan [20] , VIP [15] , and HoloVir [12] directly align short reads to a reference database of whole genomes for taxonomy annotation. Many of these tools were initially developed for bacteria but adapted later for viruses and tend to work poorly due to the much smaller reference databases available for viruses than for bacteria [7] . In addition, as many virus annotation tools (i.e., Metavir [23] , Metavir2 [24] , Virome [30] , MG-RAST [16] ) are web-based, users need to upload their data to the website and wait for a long time to get results.",

            "text": "First, FastViromeExplorer calls kallisto [2] as a subprocess to map the input reads against the reference database. Kallisto was developed to map RNA-seq data to a reference transcriptome (all the transcripts for a genome) leveraging the pseudoalignment process and estimate the abundance of the transcripts using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [5] . As there is no actual sequence alignment of the entire read over the reference sequences, the pseudoalignment process enables read mapping to be both lightweight and superfast. For example, kallisto was able to map and quantify 30 million paired-end RNA-seq reads for the human transcriptome in less than 10 minutes on a small laptop computer with a 1.3-GHz processor [2] . In addition to the ultrafast speed, kallisto also gives accurate estimation of abundance of each transcript or reference sequence [25, 28] . Consequently, kallisto could provide an ideal tool for virus type and abundance annotation in metagenomics samples that commonly have tens of millions of reads, mapping of which using commonly used programs such as BLAST can be time-consuming and often infeasible without computer clusters. Therefore, FastViromeExplorer deploys kallisto for the purpose of read mapping and abundance estimation of the annotated viruses. The k-mer size in kallisto can be altered depending on user's need, and experiments have shown that the default size 31 works well for metagenomics data and is therefore kept as default also in FastViromeExplorer.",

This criterion is motivated by the observation that some annotated viruses only have reads mapped to the repeat regions of their genomes. For example, while analyzing the fecal samples from Lee et al. [14] , we found that for the BeAn 58058 virus (NC 032111.1), all the reads were mapped to one particular region of its genome, from 8,200 bp to 8,700 bp (see supplementary figure 1 ). Analyzing this region using RepeatMasker [27] revealed that it is a simple repeat region and falls into the class of Alu elements. If the virus is truly present in the sample, we expect reads to be mapped to not only the repeat region but also other regions of the genome. Therefore, finding this virus is likely an artifact caused by the prevalence of repeat regions instead of real biological signals. By imposing this criterion, we filter out any virus for which all the reads are mapped to a repeat region of the virus genome. If a virus is truly present in the sample, the mapped reads to the virus should come from random locations of the genome, assuming that the mapped reads follow a Poisson distribution along the genome, the expected coverage of the virus genome C e can be computed by Equation (3). If the reads are all mapped to a repeat region, the observed coverage of the virus genome C o is expected to be much lower than C e , as a result, R is low and by imposing a cutoff of 0.3 (determined based on our empirical analyses), viruses that have reads mapped to only repeat regions get filtered out.",

This criterion requires that the mapped reads should cover at least 10% of the viral genome. Manual inspection of the annotation results reveals that very large viruses may have several repeat regions in their genomes and as a result, though all the reads are mapped to the repeat regions, they are mapped to different repeat regions. In these cases, the difference between C o and C e may be small and therefore R can be high enough to pass the first filter. However, it is very likely that the annotation is simply an artifact of repetitive sequences. For example, while analyzing the fecal samples [14] , we found that Pandoravirus dulcis (NC 021858.1), a very large virus with 1,908,524 bps, has several repeat regions, and all the reads were mapped only to the repeat regions (see supplementary figure 2 ). Hence, to alleviate this annotation artifact, C o \u2265 0.1 is used as the second filter. As repeat regions of a virus usually cover less than 10% of the genome [19] , if any virus is covered for more than 10% by the reads, it is reasonable to assume that the reads are not merely from repeat regions and thus the virus should be considered in the annotation result.",

For example, in the fecal samples [14] that we annotated, four reads were mapped to Rose rosette virus RNA3 (NC 015300.1). As the virus has only 1,544 bps, four reads of length 150 bps were enough to pass criteria 1 and 2. But as only a handful of reads are mapped, it is likely that the virus is false positive.

FastViromeExplorer has the shortest running time for all the seven data sets. For the data set with 5 million reads FastViromeExplorer took only seven minutes, compared to 12 minutes for ViromeScan, 31 minutes for Blastn. The speedup of FastViromeExplorer compared to ViromeScan became much more pronouced when a larger reference database was used. Figure 2b shows that when we used the larger reference database, for a data set with 5 million reads, FastViromeExplorer took 17 minutes, compared to 53 minutes for ViromeScan, and 4 hours and 40 minutes for Blastn. So FastViromeExplorer ran 3 times faster than ViromeScan and 16 times faster than Blastn. For the largest data set with 40 million reads, FastViromeExplorer took 2 hours and 27 minutes, a 2.5x speedup compared to ViromeScan that took 6 hours and 23 minutes. Taken together, when using NCBI virus and phage database as reference, FastViromeExplorer takes on average about 1 minute to process one million reads; when using a larger database (125,842 mVCs, 2GB), FastViromeExplorer takes 3-4 minutes to process one million reads, a 2-3x speed up compared to ViromeScan. Note that the indexing time (for both FastViromeExplorer and ViromeScan) was not counted in the running time shown (Figure 2 ) as indexing is only one time process. Once the index file is generated, it can be used to annotate any metagenomic data. Simulated datasets were initially used to compare the annotation performance of FastViromeExploree with Viromescan and Blastn. Sinces viruses mutate fast, even if it is the same viral species, the viral sequences in the metagenomic data might not be exactly the same as their sequences in the reference database, it is therefore important to examine the performance of an annotation tool taking into account 6 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/196998 doi: bioRxiv preprint Figure 2 : Comparison of running time among FastViromeExplorer, ViromeScan, and Blastn for seven data sets with 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 million reads, respectively (a) against a reference database containing 8,957 NCBI RefSeq viruses, (b) against a reference database containing 125,842 mVCs virus' high mutation rate. We therefore simulated four data sets with different mutation rates (3%, 5%, 7%, and 10%) from the references and applied FastViromeExplorer, ViromeScan, and Blastn. Figure 3 shows the F1 score (recall and precision are given in supplementary file 1). All the tools have high precision (99%) across all the data sets. But as mutation rate becomes higher, the number of mapped reads reduces and recall becomes lower for all the tools. In terms of F1 score, Blastn has the best score, FastViromeExplorer has similar but slightly lower score, and ViromeScan has the lowest score. For the data set with the highest mutation rate 10%, the F1 scores for Blastn, FastViromeExplorer and ViromeScan are 0.79, 0.7, and 0.43 respectively. But FastViromeExplorer took 2 minutes compared to Blastn 8 minutes. Therefore, for these simulated data sets and using all eukarytoic viruses as the reference database, FastViromeExplorer runs four times faster than Blastn while maintaining a similar F1 score to Blastn. As viruses are known to have fast mutation rates, Blastn and its variants (e.g., Blastp) are considered the \"gold standard\" approach to annotate viral sequences in metagenomic data but very time-consuming, having similar performance yet running much faster is highly desired for an annotation tool.",

Analysis of the ViromeScan result shows that the most abundant virus, Encephalomyocarditis virus, has all the reads mapped to a repeat region of its genome (see supplementary figure 3 ), indicating that the annotation is likely false positive. In fact, Encephalomyocarditis virus was also present in the initial result produced by FastViromeExplorer, but was discarded after the first filtering step. To further examine the effect of our three filtering criteria, we applied them to the ViromeScan result. Figure 4 shows that most of the viruses were filtered out and only Human endogenous retrovirus K113 and Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus remained, both of which were also present in the final result of FastViromeExplorer. The finding here shows the importance of the filtering criteria in removing viruses that might be annotation artifacts caused by repeats, low coverage, and small genome sizes.",

[18] as reference. These mVCs are mostly unknown partial or complete viral genomes but have been predicted/annotated for their possible hosts. Therefore, the host information of the mVCs can be used to examine the annotation result. Figure 5 shows the relative abundance of host bacteria across all donor and recipient samples. The order Bacteroidales is more abundant than the order Clostridiales in all donor samples. For the recipient, prior to FMT, the order Clostridiales clearly dominated the microbiota, however, after the transplantation, the abundance of the order Bacteroidales increased dramatically and the abundance of the order Clostridiales decreased greatly. This result indicates that due to the transplantation, phages with host bacteria from the order Bacteroidales were transferred from the donor to the recipient. For example, in donor samples, \"SRS049900 LANL scaffold 14438\" is one of the most abundant mVC, being the most abundant in donor samples 1 and 2, and the second most abundant in samples 3 and 4. This mVC was not present in the recipient's preFMT sample but was highly abundant in the postFMT samples, suggesting the successful transferring of the mVC from the donor to the recipient.",
