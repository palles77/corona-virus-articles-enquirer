At the same time, mass media reported that a pneumonia epidemic in Guangdong was causing considerable fear and disruption among the local population, but provided no details about the etiology of the apparently infectious disease. One week later, CSR reported the detection of an avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in a child from Hong Kong. Following a visit to mainland China, several members of the family had presented with a similar illness, to which two of the child's relatives had succumbed.",

Diagnosis, therefore, continues to rely on the clinical examination, supported by case definitions that include the risk assessment according to the 2004 updated WHO guidelines (Tables 2 and 3) . The initial symptoms of SARS are nonspecific, complicating the differential diagnosis. The mean incubation period is 5 days with the range of 2-10 days although there are isolated reports of longer incubation periods. Unlike influenza virus, where the patients are most infectious in the first 2 days of illness, transmission from symptomatic SARS patients usually occurred on or after the fifth day of onset of disease, which is in line with the rising viral load in nasopharyngeal secretions that peaked at around day 10. There have been no reports of transmission occurring before the onset of symptoms. The typical clinical presentation of SARS is that of viral pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration. Patients initially develop influenza-like prodromal symptoms. Fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, rigors, and nonproductive cough are the major presenting symptoms, whereas rhinorrhea and sore throat are less frequently seen. Clinical deterioration, often accompanied by watery diarrhea, commonly occurs 1 week after the onset of illness. Although history of fever is the most frequently reported symptom, it may be absent on initial measurement. Severe cases develop rapidly progressing respiratory distress and oxygen desaturation with approximately 20% requiring intensive care. Chest radiographs typically show ground-glass opacities and focal consolidations, especially in the periphery and subpleural regions of the lower zones. Progressive involvement of both lungs is not uncommon. Features during the later stages have sometimes included spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subpleural fibrosis and cystic changes. Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV has been a striking feature of the SARS outbreak. The majority of the cases have occurred in adults. Children are less commonly affected than adults and usually have a milder illness. The overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.

Numerous potential antiviral agents have been identified using different approaches. In vitro susceptibility test results demonstrate that IFN-alpha and IFN-beta have some potential activity. Ribavirin has good activity when tested in human Caco-2 cells despite its lack of activity in Vero cells. The viral proteases are important targets for the development of antiviral drugs. Protease inhibitors like nelfinavir, glycyrrhizin, chloroquine, and many others as well as many herbal formulations have been found to possess some antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in vitro. In addition, the use of nitric oxide (S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine) inhalation as an experimental form of rescue therapy for SARS appeared to have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV. Screening of chemical libraries has identified several inhibitors of the viral protease and helicase. Identification of angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an obligatory cellular receptor for SARS-CoV contributed to understanding of the SARS-CoV entry process, and helped to characterize two targets of antiviral therapeutics: the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2. However, most of the chemicals or approaches have not been evaluated in human or animal models.",

Fortunately, SARS-CoV has -at least so far -not established itself permanently in the human population.
