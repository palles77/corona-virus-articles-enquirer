Thus some clues about the role of protein-bound carbohydrate can be obtained by comparing the biochemical fates and functions of glycosylated proteins with their non-glycosylated counterparts, or with proteins exhibiting differences in the type of oligosaccharide side chains. Cells infected with enveloped viruses are good systems for studying both aspects of protein glycosylation, since they contain a limited number of different glycoproteins, often with well-defined functions. Tunicamycin, an antibiotic, as well as several sugar analogues have been found to act as inhibitors of protein glycosylation by virtue of their anti-viral properties. They interfere with various steps in the dolichol pathway resulting in a lack of functional lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursors.",

It inhibits the first step in the dolichol pathway, namely the formation of GlcNAe-PP-Dol from P-Dol and UDP-GieNAe [32] , and appears to be a structural analogue of UDP-GIcNAc, being composed of uracil, fatty acid, GIcNAc and tunicamine, an unusual 11carbon aminodeoxydialose [31] . Tunicamycin itself is a generic name for a mixture of closely related structures containing variations in their fatty acid moieties [6] . Several other antibiotics that affect the biosynthesis of the lipid intermediates involved in bacterial cell wall formation interfere with the dolichol pathway [4, 6] . The peptide antibiotics amphomycin, tsushimyein and showdomycin inhibit the formation of dolichol-linked monosaccharides, whereas bacitracin has been found to interfere with several different reactions in the dolichol pathway, depending upon the system used [4, 6] . The elongation of Man(GIcNAc)2-PP-Dol (hen oviduct membranes), the formation of GicNAc-PP-Dol (calf pancreas microsomes) and (GlcNAc)2-PP-Doi synthesis (yeast membranes) have all bee.n reported to be sensitive to bacitracin [4, 6] . Diumycin was found to inhibit not only Man-P-Dol formation, but also the formation of GlcNAc-PP-Dol and (GlcNAc)2-PP-Dol, the addition of GlcNAc to GIcNAc-PP-Dol being more sensitive to inhibition than the transfer of Glc-NAc-I-P to P-Dol [4, 6] .",

The high electronegativity of fluorine when present seems to have an adverse effect on the enzyme-substrate interaction, as shown by the fact that the Ki for GDP-2FMan is over 10 times higher than that for GDP-2dGIc. Also, GDP-4dMan is a much better inhibitor of Man-P-Dol formation than GDP-4FMan, which is non-inhibitory up to a concentration of at least 200/xM [34] . As mentioned above, glucosamine itself, rather than a metabolite, is an inhibitor of protein glycosylation. However, glucosamine in the form of UDP-glucosamine is also an inhibitor [47] . It should be pointed out that UDP-glucosamine is only a product of galactosamine (not glucosamine) metabolism. UDP-glucosamine acts as an analogue of UDP-GIc and, in vitro, it inhibits GIc-P-Dol synthesis as a result of the formation of glucosamine-P-Doi, which can no longer be transferred to Man9(GIcNAc)2-PP-Dol, raising the possibility that there may be depletion of P-Dol pools, and consequently an inhibition of protein glycosylation in cells treated with galactosamine [46] .",

The periodate oxidised sugar nucleotides o-UDP-GIc and o-UDP-GI-cNAc were suicide substrates, inhibiting the formation of GIc-P-Dol and (GIcNAc)2-PP-Dol respectively, o-UDP-GIcNAc preferentially inhibited the addition of GIcNAc to GlcNAc-PP-Dol [47] .

Bromoconduritol is an active sitedirected covalent inhibitor of a-glucosidases, being obtained by chemical synthesis from myoinositol [50] . When incubated with a rat liver glucosidase preparation, bromoconduritol inhibited the release of the innermost glucose residue from the oligosaccharide Glc3Man9GIcNAc, resulting in the accumulation of GlclMan9Glc-NAc [51] . In influenza virt~s.infected chick embryo cells treated with bromoconduritol, the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides was inhibited and the viral glycoproteins contained high-mannose oligo-saccharides with the composition GlclManT_9(GlcNAc)2 [51] . Thus, the in vitro and in vivo data indicate that bromoconduritol is an inhibitor of glucosidase II, even though oligosaccharides with 1 Glc residue rather than 2 Glc residues accumulate. A possible explanation for this apparent anomaly could be that bromoconduritol interferes with the binding of oligosaccharide to the active site, after removal of 1 Glc residue from Glc2Man9(GlcNAc)2, rather than with the catalytic site of the enzyme [3] . 1-Deoxynojirimycin is a potent inhibitor of glucosidase I and glucosidase II in vitro [3, 6] . The sensitivity of the trimming glucosidases to the drug varies depending upon the enzyme source. Thus, with the enzymes from yeast, 50% inhibition of enzyme activity was obtained with 20/~M for glucosidase I and 5/~M for glucosidase II [52] , whereas with calf liver microsomes, 50% inhibition was obtained with 3 ~M for glucosidase I and 20 tLM for glucosidase II [53] . In intact cells, 1-deoxynojirimycin inhibited the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides [52] and high-mannose oligosaccharides of the composition GIcI_3Mang(GIcNAc)2 accumulated [54] . Oligosaccharides containing 3 glucose residues accounted for only 20% of the mixture, indicating that in vivo, whilst 1-deoxynojirimycin interferes with the action of both trimming glucosidases, it preferentially inhibits glucosidase II [54] . Apart from being a trimming inhibitor, 1deoxynojirimycin may also interfere with the formation of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor GicaMang(GlcNAc)2-PP-Dol [3] . It was thought that the inhibitory effect may be related mechanistically to the inhibition of lipidlinked oligosaccharide biosynthesis by glu~:osamine [3] . Indeed, methylation of the ring nitrogen suppressed the inhibition of lipid-linked oli-gosaccha6de synthesis. The resulting N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin (MdN) was a more potent inhibitor of glucosidase I than the parent compound [53, 55] . In vivo MdN inhibited the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides and high-mannose oligosaccharides of the composition Glc3Man7_9(GlcNAc)2 accumulated [55] . The effects of 1-deoxynojirimycin and MdN on the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides were compared using cultured intestinal epithelial cells. It was found that 5 mM of 1-deoxynojirimycin was required to produce maximal inhibition, whereas only 1 mM of the N-methyl-derivative was required to produce the same effect. In addition, in the presence of the N-methylderivative, 70% of the oligosaccharides contained 3 glucose residues in contrast to 20% in the 1-deoxynojirimycin-treated sample [54] . Therefore, N-methyl-1-deoxynojirimycin is the prefer-red derivative for the inhibition of glucosidase I without the added complication of interfering with lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthesis.",

Castanospermine appears to be non-toxic to the treated cells with no effects on the formation of lipid-linked oligosaccharide or protein synthesis being observed [6] .

It was shown to be an inhibitor of Golgi mannosidase I [58] , and, in cells treated with the drug, the conversion of high-mannose oligosaccharides into those of the complex-type was blocked [59] [60] [61] . The major oligosaccharide present on the glycoproteins was Mang(GIcNAc)2, confirming that Golgi mannosidase I is the sensitive enzyme [59] [60] [61] . dMM is a competitive inhibitor of mannosidase I having a Ki of 2/~M for the rat liver enzyme [62] . The rat liver endoplasmic reticulum o~-mannosidase was not sensitive to the drug [62] . One disadvantage of the use of dMM as a trimming inhibitor lies in the fact that it can also act as an inhibitor of the formation of lipidlinked oligosaccharides [59] (A. Tiusty, W. McDowell and R.T. Schwarz, unpublished data). In chick embryo cells, for instance, the inhibition of lipid-linked oligosaccharide synthesis is drastic (90% inhibition with I mM), whereas with BHK or MDCK cells there is little or no inhibition at concentrations of dMM sufficient for the suppression of mannosidase I activity [59, 60] . As with 1-deoxynojirimycin, N-methylation suppressed the inhibition of lipid-linked oligosaccharide, but the resulting N-methyl-l-deoxymannojirimycin was not a more potent mannosidase inhibitor [41] .",

            "text": "2R,5R-Dihydroxymethyl 3R, 4R-dihydroxypyrrolidine (DMDP) was the first of this new type to be used as a trimming inhibitor. It has been isolated from the leaves of Derris elliptica and seeds of Lonchocarpus sericeus, and its synthesis from glucose has been reported [63] . DMDP is a potent inhibitor of both a-and/3-glucosidases with the concentrations required to give 50% inhibition about 60 times and 10 times lower, respectively, than those of 1-deoxynojirimycin [64] . However, there have been conflicting reports concerning the effects of DMDP on oligosaccharide processing in vivo. It was first reported [65] with influenza virus-infected MDCK cells that DMDP inhibited the trimming glucosidase I, since in treated cells the conversion of high-mannose oligosaccharides into complex-type oligosaccharides was inhibited and oligosaccharides of the composition GlcaMana,9(GIc-NAc)2 accumulated on the viral glycoproteins. In a subsequent study [66] , using cultured intestinal epithelial cells, the formation of complex-type side chains was also inhibited but a mixture of high-mannose oligosaccharides was found with the major oligosaccharides having the composition ManT_9(GlcNAc)2. Thus, in intestinal cells, the main effect of DMDP seemed to be directed towards the trimming mannosidases [66] . The situation with influenza virus-infected chick embryo cells differed yet again. Under appropriate conditions, glucosylated high-mannose oligosaccharides of the composition Glc3Mans,9(GIc-NAc)2 were present on the viral glycoproteins formed in the presence of DMDP but the predominant structures were Man8,9(GIcNAc)2 [67] . It is not clear why the effects of DMDP on oligosaccharide processing in MDCK cells, intestinal epithelial cells and chick embryo cells should be so different but may be related to protonation of the ring nitrogen as a result of changes in pH during uptake into the cell and transport to, and penetration through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, since the non-protonated form of DMDP is the active inhibitor [3] .",

It is as effective an inhibitor of jack bean a-mannosidase as swainsonine, exhibiting 50% inhibition at 0.5/~M. Lysosomal t~-mannosidase was also sensitive to inhibition, but a much higher concentration was needed for 50% inhibition. In both cases, the inhibition was competitive and, as with DMDP, the non-protonated form is the more effective inhibitor [68, 69] . In influenza virus-infected MDCK cells treated with DIM [691, the synthesis of complex-type oligosaccharides was inhibited maximally by about 75%. The major high-mannose oligosaccharide that accumulated had the composition Mang(GIcNAc)2, indicating that DIM inhibits mannosidase I. In addition, some of the oligosaccharides synthesized in the presence of DIM were of the hybrid type, suggesting that DIM also exerts an effect on mannosidase II. Thus, in intact cells, DIM acts by inhibiting both mannosidase I and mannosidase II, although it is a less effective inhibitor of the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides than swainsonine [69] .",

Sindbis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and mouse hepatitis virus (Table III) . These results corroborate observations made in other nonviral systems dealing with the secretion or surface expression of glycoproteins [3, 6, 8, 30] and a consensus suggests that glucose trimming may be important in the initial stages of protein folding, once the polypeptide chain has been released from the ribosome. Mannose trimming, on the other hand, does not appear to be as important, although with the mannosidase inhibitors, 1-deoxymannojirimycin or swainsonine, the inhibition of complex-type oligosaccharide formation is better than with any of the glucosidase inhibitors [661, and it is usual for some mannose trimming to take place even when glucose trimming has been inhibited (cf. the oligosaccharides formed in the presence of bromoconduritol, MdN or castanospermine). The incomplete inhibition of complex-type oligosaccharide formation has been attributed to the presence of a Golgi endo-o~-D-mannosidase that can remove a glucosylmannose disaccharide yielding Mana(GIc-NAc)2 [92] and which provides an alternative route for oligosaccharide processing to the sequential action of glucosidase II and mannosidase I [92] . The initial stages of mannose trimming are important in the Sindbis virus-BHK system for determining the final destination of viral envelope glycoproteins, since treatment with the mannosidase inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin resulted in budding of the virus from internal membranes [60] . This effect was also observed in cells treated with monensin [93] and in a mutant cell line [94] . The observations concerning the biological effects of trimming inhibitors confirm that N-linked oligosaccharides can serve a structural role at the time of polypeptide folding and are in agreement with the idea [95] that the existence of a sin.gle pathway for oligosaccharide processing demands that the precursor oligosaccharide meet the structural requirements of the most sensitive glycoproteins.",

            "text": "The results of the treatment of cells transformed by retroviruses with trimming inhibitors (Table III) add weight to the notion that every system has to be examined in its own right and that no generalisations can be made concerning the effects of inhibitors of oligosaccharide processing. Thus, on one hand, avian retroviruses, such as Rous sarcoma virus [84, 85] and avian erythroblastosis virus [89] , appear to be unaffected by changes in the oligosaccharide composition of their envelope glycoprotein or their onco-gene product, whereas the formation of Friend mink cell focus-inducing murine leukaemia virus [86] and the transforming properties of the feline sarcoma virus v-fins oncogene product [87, 88] are affected. Of current topical interest is the observation that the virus responsible for causing the disease AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), appears to be sensitive to the effects of glucosidase trimming inhibitors [90, 91] . In the presence of castanospermine or 1-deoxynojirimycin, both envelope glycoprotein-mediated syncytium formation and HIV infection of CD4 \u00f7 T-cells were inhibited [90, 91] . It is thought that perturbation of the carbohydrate side-chains of the HIV envelope glycoprotein results in a lower affinity of gpl20 for the CD4 receptor of CD4 + T-cells [90] . The decrease in syncytium formation was attributed to inhibition of processing of the precursor protein gpl60, resulting in decreased cell surface expression of the mature envelope glycoprotein gpl20. In addition, steps involved in membrane fusion after binding of CD4 antigen may be affected [91] . The anti-viral effects exhibited by the glucosidase trimming inhibitors suggest that modification of the glycosylation state of the HIV envelope glycoprotein may be of use in the treatment of HIV infections [90, 911. The observation that inhibitors of protein glycosylation and oligosaccharide trimming have anti-viral effects leads to the question as to whether they could be used as chemotherapeutic agents. Certainly many of the trimming inhibitors, which appear to be non-toxic, have the potential for use in anti-viral chemotherapy [3] , as indicated by the findings with HIV, but inhibitors of lipid-linked oligosaccharide assembly, such as tunicamycin, are too toxic. In fact, glycosylation inhibitors have already been tried as anti-viral agents against localised herpes virus infections. 2-Deoxyglucose was used to treat herpes simplex virus-induced keratinitis in rabbits [96] and human genital herpes simplex virus infections [97] . However, the significance of these results was questioned [98] and further studies failed to show any effect of deoxyglucose, which discouraged further work on the treatment of herpes infections with glycosylation inhibitors [3] . In addition to their potential antiviral properties, inhibitors of oligosaccharide trimming may be useful as immunomodulators for the treatment of cancerous tumours. Tumour invasion and metastasis are presumably mediated via interactions between oligosaccharides located on cell surfaces. It would therefore be expected that changes in the oligosaccharide composition at the cell surface may alter the binding of tumour cells and thus the spread of the cancer. Swainsonine has been found to be useful as an immunomodulator. Thus treatment of B16-F10 murine lymphoma cells with swainsonine inhibited pulmonary colonisation [100] and, in immunodeficient mice, the growth of a sarcoma was inhibited and metastasis of the B6 melanoma in the lung was reduced [101] .",

In this vein, anti-herpetic drugs, such as acyclovir (9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)-guanine), are activated in virus-infected cells by a virusencoded thymidine kinase, producing inhibitors of DNA polymerase [99] . In an analogous manner, it may be possible to develop virus-specific inhibitors of glycosyltransferases. Although the synthesis of viral DNA is undoubtedly the prime target for anti-viral chemotherapy with nucleoside analogues, these compounds may also interfere with other processes, such as glyeosylation of viral glycoproteins, through the formation of sugar nucleotide analogues that interfere with the glycosyltransferases involved in the glycosylation pathways. Indeed, the result that (E)-5-(2-bromvinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine inhibits galactosylation of N-and O-linked oligosaccharides of herpes simplex virus-1 glycoproteins [102] indicates the potential of nucleoside analogues as glycosylation inhibitors.",

Like the other GDP-sugar analogues, the inhibition of lV;an-P-Dol synthesis by GDP-3dMan and GDP-6dMan could be reversed by addition of P-Dol, implying that they are competitive inhibitors of GDP-Man: P-Dol mannosyltransferase. The apparent inhibition constants for the GDP-sugar analogues were calculated from Dixon plots (W. McDowell and R.T. Schwarz, unpublished data) and the following order of inhibitor efficiency was found with the apparent K~ between parentheses: GDP-6dMan (0.4 /.LM) > GDP-3dMan (1.0 ~M) > GDP-2dGlc (1.3/~M) > GDP-4dMan (3.1/zM) > GDP-2FMan (15/zM). For compa-rison, the apparent Ks for GDP-Man was 0.5 /xM and the apparent Ki for GDP was 56 ~M (W. McDowell and R.T. Schwarz, unpublished data). From these results, it is clear that the hydroxyls at carbons 3 and 6 are not involved in the binding of GDP-Man to the active site, whereas those at carbons 2 and 4 must have some interaction.",
