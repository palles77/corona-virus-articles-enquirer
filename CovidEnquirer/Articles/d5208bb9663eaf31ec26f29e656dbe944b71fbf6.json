Although Japan was spared from the 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hospitals were placed on high alert. The actual preparedness level of hospitals can be determined by examining individual perceptions among the hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). The objective of this study was to assess the level of preparedness of emergency infection control measures in Japan and to quantify the differences in preparedness across institutions and disciplines. From July to September 2003, a questionnaire survey concerning the perceptions of risks and countermeasures and knowledge about SARS was distributed at seven tertiary hospitals. Disciplines were categorized as emergency room (ER)/intensive care unit (ICU), surgical, medical, and \"others\". Of the 9978 questionnaires administered, 6929 valid responses were received and analyzed. After adjusting for age, sex, and job category, specific institutional measures (I-scores) were found to be more indicative of the level of preparedness across institutions and disciplines than were measures of overall effectiveness (E-scores) or knowledge of preventive measures (K-scores). In particular, the difference in Iscores was much more substantial across institutions than across disciplines. Across disciplines, surgical ranked lower than ER/ICU or medical. In conclusion, substantial differences in emergency infection control measures, as perceived by HCWs, exists among hospitals in Japan, with the differences across institutions exceeding those across disci-plines. To achieve a higher level of preparedness for infectious diseases, institutions should designate and implement effective emergency infection control measures.",

As regards the first aim, we have shown in a previous report that individual perception is likely to be influenced by institutional measures. 7 The present study was more concerned with our second aim, and in this study, we analyzed data at the collective (i.e., institutional and disciplinary) level. It should be noted that most institutional infection control measures in Japan at the time of the SARS epidemic were voluntary, 8, 9 and differences could have existed which entailed strengths and weaknesses in the state of preparedness. The objective of this study was, therefore, to assess the levels of preparedness in emergency infection control measures related to SARS, with particular focus on differences across institutions and disciplines.",

The E-score was the score for \"effectiveness,\" divided by 3 (full score of 3 for 1 question), for possible scores of \u22121 to 1. The K-score was the sum of correct responses to the 15 questions regarding the effectiveness of various preventive measures divided by 15 (full score of 1 for 15 questions), for possible scores of 0 to 1. The correct response was based on WHO guidelines 10 and other findings. The range of I-and E-scores between \u22121 and +1 reflected negative and positive perceptions, and accounted for the gradient in responses (probably agree/disagree, agree/disagree, strongly agree/disagree). In contrast, Kscores ranging between 0 and +1 corresponded to the proportion of correct knowledge, and accounted for binary responses (correct response/incorrect response). The Kscore thus reflected the mean rate of correct knowledge among respondents by institution and discipline. The I-and E-scores are, therefore, directly comparable, whereas the K-score is not comparable with the other scores.

When we categorized the mean I-scores for the seven institutions into quartiles, we found that A was in the lowest quartile; B and C were in the lower-middle quartile; D, E, and F were in the upper-middle quartile; and G was in the highest quartile, with a 0.66-point difference from institution A (\u22120.17) to institution G (0.49; Table 2 ).

Thus, in effect, the difference in mean I-score was larger and more significant across institutions than across disciplines. In addition, pairwise comparisons showed that institution G had a higher mean I-score than the other institutions, and that, across disciplines, \"medical\" and \"ER/ICU\" had the highest mean I-scores and \"others\" had a particularly low mean I-score (Table 2  and Table 5 ) Numbers in parentheses show ranks adjusted for equal ranks a Ranks are based on the values of the I-, E-, and K-scores shown in Tables 2-4 b Based on the rank sum Table 2 also shows the differences across institutions according to each discipline, when institutions and disciplines were combined.

For the \"surgical\" discipline, the mean scores differed by 0.66 points across institutions, from \u22120.16 for institution B to 0.50 for institution G.

Hence, the perception of the overall effectiveness of institutional measures (E-score) was more negative than the combined perception of three actual institutional measures (I-score). A possible explanation is that the Japanese system for emergency infection control has not been tested, which may have caused the lack of confidence among HCWs in the effectiveness of institutional measures. In fact, the positive response rates for effectiveness of institutional measures differed substantially between HCWs in Singapore (96%), where the institutional preventive measures were tested and found to be effective, and Japan (31%), where the institutional preventive measures were untested. 11 Although the difference in knowledge levels was not substantial, certain combinations of discipline and institution had higher-than-expected knowledge levels. For example, ER/ICU HCWs at institution C had a score of 74%, medical HCWs at institution B had a score of 69%, and \"other\" HCWs at institution B had a score of 68%. Indeed, if HCWs had acquired knowledge on a personal, as opposed to an institutional and/or disciplinary basis, the K-scores would be more randomly distributed across institutions and disciplines. In this survey, 91% of all respondents answered positively to the question \"learn as much as you can about SARS\" (data not shown). Thus, the individual acquisition of knowledge may have contributed to a narrowing of the differences among institutions/disciplines. Among disciplines, the three scores for ER/ICU and medical HCWs were higher than those for surgical and \"other\" HCWs. We expected that the ER/ICU HCWs would have higher scores, because staff engaged in critical care disciplines would have a higher risk of exposure to infectious agents, due to both the specific procedures they perform (e.g., endotracheal intubation, which increases the risk of SARS infection 13-fold) 12 and their exposure to severely ill patients. 13 Under such circumstances, the implementation of emergency infection control measures is imperative, especially for ER/ICU workers.",

Third, there may have been a selection bias, in that the number of institutions surveyed was small, although we made an effort to select major hospitals distributed throughout Japan. Fourth, the K-score may not accurately reflect knowledge of preventive measures. HCWs who had accurate knowledge of preventive measures may have answered incorrectly to some items, due to conflicting information, e.g., alcohol rubs and shoe-covers were considered optimal in some guidelines. However, such information was limited, and, hence, its effect should not have been strong. Fifth, we evaluated the differences across institutions and disciplines from the viewpoint of HCWs, but we did not consider the organizational factors associated with this difference. This is also a very important point for each institution to promote their level of preparedness. Such evaluations constitute a separate theme, warranting another study, which will be conducted in the near future.",
