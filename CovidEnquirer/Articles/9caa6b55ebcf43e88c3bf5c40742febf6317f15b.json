Participants: Patients were aged ! 65 years, hospitalized for NHAP, which was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms and abnormal chest radiographs, from April 2006 to March 2007. Measurements: Demographics, clinical parameters, and investigation results were recorded. Microbial investigations comprised sputum routine and mycobacterial cultures, blood and urine cultures, serology, and nasopharyngeal aspirate viral culture and polymerase chain reaction tests. Suspected aspiration pneumonitis was arbitrarily defined as NHAP without pathogens identified. Results: After excluding lone bacteriuria, 108 episodes of NHAP in 94 patients were included. Twelve APs were detected in 11 patients. There was no clinical feature to distinguish between infections caused by APs and other pathogens. The commonest APs were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (3). No Legionella pneumophila was detected by urinary antigen test. None of the patients with AP infection received antibiotics indicated for AP infections. However, AP infections did not result in mortality. No pathogen was isolated in 31.5% of cases. Patients without pathogens isolated were less likely to have purulent sputum and crepitations on chest auscultation, compared with those with pneumonia caused by identified pathogens. Conclusions: Atypical pathogens (APs) were not associated with mortality even in cases where the prescribed antibiotics did not cover APs. NHAP may not necessarily be treated with empirical antibiotics covering APs.",

According to the Cochrane Systematic Review, the empirical use of antibiotics with atypical coverage, compared with those without atypical coverage, did not provide survival benefit or clinical efficacy in patients hospitalized for lowseverity pneumonia. 4 The British Thoracic Society guidelines, however, recommend the empirical use of combination regimen of penicillin and macrolide antibiotics in patients hospitalized for moderate-to high-severity pneumonia. 5 The Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society guidelines have no recommendation on the empirical use of antibiotics with atypical coverage in nursing homeeacquired pneumonia (NHAP). 6 The importance of APs (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila spp., and Coxiella burnetii) and Legionella pneumophila in older patients with pneumonia is unclear. APs were more likely to infect older people with multiple comorbidities than younger ones, 7 and were more common in CAP than in NHAP. 8, 9 There is little information regarding the prevalence and mortality of AP infections in NHAP and CAP, which are the major determining factors on the empirical use of antibiotic regimens with atypical coverage. Such information is needed to establish the role of APs and L. pneumophila in NHAP. 10 We performed a subgroup analysis of NHAP in a study on influenza-like illness (ILI) in old people living in nursing homes. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of AP infections in NHAP and review the need for empirical antibiotic therapy with atypical coverage in NHAP.",

The combined use of NPA PCR tests and traditional serology likely had contributed to a greater prevalence of AP infections in our study. M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infections were diagnosed exclusively by NPA PCR tests, but not serology. Meanwhile, Chlamydophila and C. burnetii can be detected only by serology. All the patients with AP infection survived, whereas only one of them had received antibiotic covering APs. Another study also showed that AP infection resulted in a lower 30-day mortality than other pathogens, although the difference was not statistically significant (2.2% vs 6.0%, P \u00bc .09). 7 It is hypothesized that APs cause pneumonia of milder severity, and its clinical course is usually self-limiting without antibiotic therapy, even in older people of lower immunity.

            "text": "Legionella infection is acquired by inhalation of contaminated aerosols produced by water systems, such as cooling towers, showers, and hot water distributing systems. Aspiration of contaminated water is another route of transmission. Hot and humid environment facilitates the formation of biofilm and the subsequent growth of L. pneumophila in water tanks and pipes. 15 Such environments, which predispose to the proliferation of this bacterium, are commonly encountered in Hong Kong, especially in nursing home settings. However, previous studies showed that L. pneumophila was a rare (<5%) pathogen in NHAP. 8, 9, 13, 14 Our study has confirmed the rarity of Legionella infection in NHAP, based on the result of urinary antigen tests that were performed in nearly 90% of the study patients. This finding further supports our recommendation that empirical antibiotic with atypical coverage is not indicated routinely for NHAP. On the basis of our local data, urinary antigen test for L. pneumophila would not be a part of routine workup for NHAP because of low costeffectiveness. Aspiration pneumonitis, which is a clinical diagnosis by exclusion, is a significant cause of NHAP. Our study suggested that those nursing home residents with pneumonia who had no pathogens identified did not have purulent sputum and chest crepitations on examination. Some of these cases could be caused by aspiration pneumonitis. Because it is difficult to clinically distinguish between aspiration pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia, especially on initial assessment, 16 it is advisable to adopt a \"de-escalation\" approach and refrain from prescribing prolonged empirical antibiotics in patients with bulbar dysfunction and aspiration pneumonitis. This would help to reduce antibiotic resistance and the cost of unnecessary antibiotics.",
