            "text": "The lectin pathway of complement is a central part of innate immunity, but as a powerful inducer of inflammation it needs to be tightly controlled. The MASP2 gene encodes two proteins, MASP-2 and MAp19. MASP-2 is the serine protease responsible for lectin pathway activation. The smaller alternative splice product, MAp19, lacks a catalytic domain but retains two of three domains involved in association with the pattern-recognition molecules (PRMs): mannan-binding lectin (MBL), H-ficolin, L-ficolin and M-ficolin. MAp19 reportedly acts as a competitive inhibitor of MASP-2-mediated complement activation. In light of a ten times lower affinity of MAp19, versus MASP-2, for association with the PRMs, much higher serum concentrations of MAp19 than MASP-2 would be required for MAp19 to exert such an inhibitory activity. Just four amino acid residues distinguish MAp19 from MASP-2, and these are conserved between man, mouse and rat. Nonetheless we generated monoclonal rat anti-MAp19 antibodies and established a quantitative assay. We found the concentration of MAp19 in serum to be 217 ng/ml, i.e., 11 nM, comparable to the 7 nM of MASP-2. In serum all MASP-2, but only a minor fraction of MAp19, was associated with PRMs. In contrast to previous reports we found that MAp19 could not compete with MASP-2 for binding to MBL, nor could it inhibit MASP-2-mediated complement activation. Immunohistochemical analyses combined with qRT-PCR revealed that both MAp19 and MASP-2 were mainly expressed in hepatocytes. High levels of MAp19 were found in urine, where MASP-2 was absent.",

            "text": "MAp19, also known as sMAP, is one of two proteins arising by alternative splicing of the primary transcript of the MASP-2 gene (Stover et al., 1999b; Takahashi et al., 1999) . The other product is the pro-enzyme MASP-2, which is composed of a CUB domain, an EGF domain, a second CUB domain, two CCP domains and the activation peptide, followed by the serine protease domain (Thiel et al., 1997) . Mature MASP-2 is generated by cleavage of the activation peptide, resulting in two disulfide-linked fragments, the larger known as the A-chain and the smaller as the B-chain (Schwaeble et al., 2002; Thiel, 2007) . MAp19 consists of only the first CUB domain and the EGF domain, with an additional small C-terminal tail of four unique amino acid residues (EQSL) (Fig. 1) . These four amino acid residues are encoded by exon 5 of the gene, which also harbors the 3\u2032UTR. Like MASP-2, MAp19 is known to be expressed in the liver and is found in plasma (Stover et al., 1999a) . It forms a head-to-tail dimer, the structure of which has been solved by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 2.5 \u00c5 , and associates with MBL and the ficolins in a calcium-dependent manner. The dissociation constant for the interaction with MBL has been determined to be 13 nM, identical to the similar CUB-EGF fragment of MASP-2, but around 16 times higher than that of full-length MASP-2 (Thielens et al., 2001) . MAp19 has been suggested to act as an inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal growth in human urine (Kang et al., 1999) . More recently, MAp19 has been reported to compete with MASP-2 for binding to MBL, leading to attenuation of C4-cleaving activity and thus down-regulation of complement activation (Iwaki et al., 2006) . MAp19 is relatively well conserved, the amino acid sequence for human MAp19 being 80% and 77% identical with mouse and rat MAp19, respectively, and the unique 4 C-terminal amino acids are conserved between these species (Fig. 1A) .",

Especially the C-terminal part is very well conserved, with no difference in the unique 4 residues between human, mouse and rat. Nonetheless, we designed a peptide (Fig. 1A) encompassing the 4 unique amino acids and conjugated it to KLH or PPD (a heterogeneous protein preparation from Mycobacterium tuberculosis acting as a carrier and a potent activator of the adaptive immune system), and immunized BALB/c mice and Wistar rats. Sera were initially unsuccessfully screened in solidphase assays on MBL/MASP complexes captured on a mannan surface and ficolin/MASP complexes captured on an AcBSA surface. However, we found that we could get signals when screening on purified MBL/MASP/MAp complex or H-ficolin/ MASP/MAp complex coated directly onto wells, as well as on directly coated purified recombinant MAp19. The best responder, a Wistar rat, was boosted with rMAp19 before performing the splenectomy and myeloma fusion. The resulting hybridomas were screened in solid-phase assays as before and subcloned. The final hybridoma supernatants were reactive on directly coated rMAp19 and directly coated MBL/MASP/MAp or H-ficolin/ MASP/ MAp complexes purified from human plasma, whereas they did not give appreciable signal on recombinant MASP-2 coated directly in wells. All final clones produced antibody of the IgM isotype, and also the MAp19-specific antibodies in the serum of the rat were almost exclusively IgM. The IgM antibodies could be readily purified on Protein L agarose and sustained biotinylation without appreciable loss of activity, but did not coat well, precluding their use as capture antibodies. The specificity of the anti-MAp19 antibodies was validated by performing Western blotting with purified MBL/MASP complex (Fig. 1C) . As can be seen, the rat serum and all 6 final hybridomas were specific for MAp19, whereas the monoclonal antibody control (6G12) reacted with both MAp19 and MASP-2 (as well as some degradation fragments of MASP-2, which we have previously observed upon storage).

We compared the levels measured in serum with those measured in plasma, in a set of 70 paired serum and plasma donor samples. Although slightly higher values were measured in plasma than serum (median 258 vs. 205 ng/ml) the values were highly correlated (r 2 =0.88; Fig. 5B ).

Under dissociating conditions, i.e., high salt and EDTA, which dissociates MASPs and MAp19 from MBL and ficolins, the three peaks resolved into the two peaks at the size of the free dimer and putative tetramer. Surprisingly, this indicates that most of the MAp19 is not in complex with MBL or ficolins. Assuming that complexed and free dimer and tetramer MAp19 was measured with the same efficiency in the assay (carried out under dissociating conditions), the relative proportions of complex-bound and free MAp19 was estimated by integrating the area under the curve.

The observed absence of isotype switching in the serum from the one responding rat might indicate a response related to the induction of autoantibodies in the animal. Indeed, we found the anti-human MAp19 antibodies to cross-react with rat MAp19. Protein localization may point toward function. We therefore used one of the generated antibodies, as well as a previously generated antibody toward MASP-2, in immunohistochemical analyses. We also quantified mRNA in various tissues to determine sites of synthesis. At the mRNA level, MAp19 expression was found predominantly in the liver, with significant but very low expression in kidney and thyroid tissue, while MASP-2 expression was completely restricted to liver. From the immunohistochemical analyses it further seemed that both MAp19 and MASP-2 are produced by hepatocytes. Very few cells were positive for MAp19 staining in the thyroid, and a diffuse staining was seen in the kidney. The latter may rather originate from the filtrate, especially considering the significant presence of MAp19 in urine. In addition to their sites of synthesis, MAp19 and MASP-2 staining was observed in a number of tissues, perhaps indicating secondary localization, or perhaps local expression (either not included, or below detection level, in the tissue RNA panels). Staining of alveolar macrophages warrants caution, as these phagocytes are notorious for high lipofuscin levels, and the same consideration applies to the longlived Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In conclusion, the liver is the major site of biosynthesis of both MAp19 and MASP-2.",

Intuitively, higher serum levels should result in higher urine output, assuming that MAp19 gets filtered in the glomeruli as suggested by its small size. One confounding factor may be the total level of MASPs/MAps compared to the total level of MBL/ficolins, since one could envision that MBL/ ficolins may have a carrier function for MAp19, despite the apparently low affinity discussed below.

This finding was surprising, since a previous report suggested that MAp19 acts as a competitive inhibitor of MASP-2 (Iwaki et al., 2006) . However, the relative amounts of MAp19, MASP-2 and MBL used by Iwaki and colleagues were very far from the molecular stoichiometry in vivo, as the concentration of MAp19 was not known at that time. Thus, for their competition experiments, a constant amount of rMASP-2i (inactive mutant of MASP-2) of 0.5 \u03bcg and various amounts of rsMAP (rMAp19), from 0 to 20 \u03bcg, were incubated with 20 \u03bcl homozygous MASP-2/MAp19 \u2212/\u2212 mouse serum. This corresponds to up to 1,000 \u03bcg/ml rsMAP competing with 25 \u03bcg rMASP-2i for binding to 0.84 \u03bcg MBL (7 \u03bcg MBL-A and 35 \u03bcg MBL-C per ml serum in B6 mice), disregarding the presence of ficolins-A and -B and MASP-1, -3, and MAp44.

Serum was run either at physiological conditions (-\u2666-, Tris-buffered saline with 5 mM CaCl 2 ) or at dissociating conditions (-\u2022-, Tris buffer with 10 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) and fractions were measured in the MAp19 assay. The void volume, total volume and elution positions of protein markers are indicated. The total protein trace is also indicated (\u25aa, OD280). Fraction volume is indicated on the x-axis (ml). Fig. 8 . The influence of MAp19 and MAp44 on C4 deposition. MBL was mixed with MASP-2 and MAp19 or MAp44, then added to mannan coated wells. Subsequently C4 was added and the wells were incubated at 37\u00b0C. The amount of deposited C4b (in counts/s) is given as a function of the concentration of competitor, either rMAp44 (-\u25a0-) or rMAp19 (-\u2022-). Error bars indicate standard deviation of duplicates. The experiment was performed three times with similar results, using slight differences in conditions and different batches of purified proteins. stoichiometry is even more distorted. Whereas the experiments demonstrate that MAp19 can indeed compete with MASP-2, it appears that highly non-physiological conditions are required for such observations. At our conditions we see no evidence of such competition. Likewise for the C4 deposition, the lowest level shown is 100 ng rsMAP per 0.5 \u03bcl serum, i.e. 200 \u03bcg per 1.0 ml, which is close to 11 \u03bcMa value which is 1,000 times, 3 orders of magnitude, higher than the physiological level determined here in man. We find it highly unlikely that the physiological levels should differ this significantly in mouse from that observed in man. Thus, while MAp19 concentrations far exceeding the physiological level may be able to compete with MASP-2, in our set-up we did not observe any competition. This may be explained by the more than 10fold lower affinity of MAp19 for MBL, compared to that of the full-length MASP-2, as well as to MASP-1, MASP-3 and MAp44 counterparts (Degn et al., 2009; Degn et al., 2010) . The lower affinity may in turn be explained by the absence of the CUB2 domain possessed by the full-length proteases and MAp44 (Thielens et al., 2001; Cseh et al., 2002) .",

Furthermore, the sensorgram for MASP-2 was hardly sloping, making it unsuitable for calculations. However, using a complementary approach, Chen and Wallis examined the importance of the N-terminal domains of MASPs for binding to MBL in an inhibition assay (Chen and Wallis, 2001) . Rat MBP-A was immobilized on the solid-phase and competition of 35 S-labeled CUB-EGF-CUB binding was evaluated. Full-length MASP-1 and MASP-1 CUB-EGF-CUB yielded K i 's of 34 and 15 nM, respectively, while CUB-EGF yielded a K i of 1810 nM. The same domain configurations for MASP-2 gave K i 's of 48, 22 and 454 nM, respectively. In both cases, this demonstrates the importance of the second CUB domain, in the case of MASP-1 increasing affinity 50-100-fold and for MASP-2 10-20-fold. The results for MASP-2 fragments can be extrapolated to MAp19.",

The idea of a role in kidney function as suggested by (Kang et al., 1999) is appealing. Our literature review revealed a second paper pinpointing MAp19 in the kidney, but in relation to pathophysiology (Musante et al., 2002) . Musante and colleagues identified \"MASP-2\" as one of only 6 protein factors that alter glomerular permeability in children with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Upon closer inspection it is clear that what these authors refer to as \"MASP-2\" is really MAp19, based on the isoelectric point and size of the spot on 2D gel electrophoresis and the localization of mass spectrometry-identified peptide sequences to MAp19. Thong-boonkerd and colleagues also identified \"MASP-2\" in normal human urine, and again this was actually MAp19, based on MW and pI (Thongboonkerd et al., 2002) . Very recently, MAp19 (again referred to as MASP-2) was also found to be about 3-fold upregulated in urine of individuals undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (Aregger et al., 2010) . Another unrelated role of MAp19 was suggested by a recent report that it interacts with the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV (Liu et al., 2009) .",
