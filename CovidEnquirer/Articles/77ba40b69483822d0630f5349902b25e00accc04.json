To investigate this question a synthetic IFN inducer, poly I:C was used.

Normal CBA/H (H-2 k) astrocytes 163 express little or no detectable class II MHC antigens, as their binding to TIB94 (H-21-Ak-speeific) is not significantly higher than to HB-3 (H-2I-A dspecific) (Fig. 4a) .

It seems unlikely that material other than WNV in WNV-B (e.g. murine IFN) is responsible for the up-regulation of class II MHC antigen, as WNV-V that was passaged 4 times in Veto cells (a permanent cell line originating from monkey kidney that does not secrete murine IFN) also consistently up-regulated class II MHC antigen, though to a lesser extent than WNV-B in this particular experiment (Fig. 4d) . Furthermore, poly I :C, which \"nduced IFN production and enhanced class I MHC antigen expression in astrocyte cultures (Fig. 2c , Table 2 ) dad not induce class II MHC ant/gen expression (Fig. 4c) .

            "text": "Since it was established that MHC antigens formed an important part of the antigenic struc-165 ture recognised by T lymphocytes (Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1979; Schwartz, 1986) , there \"has been great interest in the regulation of MHC antigen expression on potentJal antigen-presenting cells. It is well documented that different virus infections may either inhibit or enhance the expression of MHC antigens, Notably, infection by adenovirus (F~i~lbo et al., 1986) , herpes simplex virus type 2 (Jennings et aL, 1985) , ectromeiia virus (Gardner et al., 1975) and measles virus (Rager-Zisman et al., 1981) can down-regulate class I MHC antigen expression of their host cells and may make the latter less susceptible to cytotoxic T cells. On the other hand, murine hepatitis virus (Massa et al., 1986; Suzumura et al., 1986 ), Epstein-Barr virus (McCune et al., 1975 , Moloney murine leukemia virus (Flyer et ai., 1985) and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (Rodriguez et al., 1987) can up-regulate class I and/or class II MHC antigen expression. Our results described here revealed that flavivirus infection can up-regulate the e:~pression of cell surface class I and class 1I I~,~HC antigens. It has been docuraented that interferon can up-regulate class ! and II MHC antigen. All three classes of IFN L~own (a, t, ~,) have been reported to enhance ,class I MHC antigen expression, while only ~,-IFN can up-regulate the expression of class II MHC ~mtigens OVong et al., 1985) . In our experiment, any treat~ent that can induce IFN production, e.,g. WI,4V-B and WNV-V infection or poly I : C treatmen~,, can up-regulate class I MHC antigens; it is possible ~hat the up-regulation of class I MHC antigen expression by WNV infection is at least patti3, the result of IFN produced after virus infection. In contrast, poly I:C treatment of astrocytes, which induces good IFN production and increases class I MHC antigen expression equal to or more than WNV infection, fails to induce class II MHC antigen expression. This finding together with the data that IFN produced in WNV-B-infected astrocyte culture can be neutralized by anti-(a + fl)-IFN antibody strongly suggests that the induction of class II MHC antigen by WNV does not depend on IFN produced. Addition of antibodies that neutralize y-IFN to WNV-infected astrocytes culture would help to answer the question if free v-IFN was involved in class II MHC antigen induction. However, the question as to what extent virus replication per se and induced interferon actually contribute to enhanced class I MHC expression is more problematic. Some obviol:s approaches used by others (Massa et al., 1986) , i.e. use of ultraviolet-inactivated virus and neutralizing McAb to the virus cannot provide definile information, because it is not known to what extent UV inactivation will inhibit viral protein and nucleic acid synthesis and the mechanism of viral neutralization is at present not well understood. Furtherraore, addition of IFN antibody may not help to exclude the role of IFN due to the autocrine activity without the need of secretion (Sanceau et al., 1987) .",

            "text": "A number of studies have shown that treatment which up-regulates the expression of cell surface class I MHC antigens increases the susceptibility of cells to lysis by appropriately sensitised Tc cells, probably due to recognition by low-affinity clones that could not exhibit cytotoxic activity without the elevation of MHC antigen expression (Shimoukevitz et al, 1985) . Infection by viruses that down-regulate cell surface MHC antigen expression, on the other hand, results in reduced susceptibility of the infected cells to lysis by virus-specific cytotoxic T cells. Thus it has l~een shown that herpes simplex virus type 2 infection, which down-regulates cell surface MHC expression, reduces the susceptibility of an SV40-and HSV2-double-infectezl targets to lysis by SV40specific Tc cells, as compared to target cells infected with SV40 alone (Jennings et al., 1985) . Adenovirus type 5 infection inhibits the cell surface expression of class I MHC antigen via the E3 protein. This phenomenon results in less efficient recognition by adenovirus-specific Tc cells of target cells infected by this wild-type virus compared to target cells infected by an E3 deletion mutant which has no effect on host MHC antigen expression (Miillbacher and Bellett, personal communication) and could be responsible for the tumorigenicity of the wild-type virus (Eager et al., 1985) . A Moloney murine leukemia virus that increases cell surface class I MHC antigen expression was also reported to increase the susceptibility of host cells to lysis by alloreactive Tc cells (Flyer et al., 1985) . However, no attempt was made to address the effect of up-regulated MHC antigen expression on the recognition of MHC-restricted, antigen-specific T ells. In this paper, we compared WNV.infected astrocytes with uninfected controls for their ability to act as targets of influenza virus-specific Tc cells and as stimulators for an Ik-reactive T cell line. The results showed that WNV infection has significant effects on T cell recognition of astrocytes. 'Ilms, after infection by influenza virus, normal astrocytes are poor targets of influenza virus-specific Tc, while doubly infected (with WNV and influenza) astrocytes can be well recognized by influenza-specific Tc. WNV-infected astrocytes from CBA/H mice can also stimulate Ik-reactive T cells significantly better than the normal astrocytes, in terms of both T cell proliferation and interleukin release. The latter function was also enhanced in populations of primary anti-H-2I k T cells. These findings are particularly interesting because astrocytes are a large population of cells in the CNS, presumably important both for the physiology and immunology of the CNS (Fontana e~ al., 1985) . Elevated T cell recognition of astroeytes could have an important effect on the organism. These findings also raise interesting questions regarding self tolerance. If T cell tolerance to self antigens is determined quantitatively (Blanden et al., 1987) the up-regulation of MHC antigens in the CNS could possibly break T cell self tolerance in the CNS. This may explain the autoimmune/virai etiology of some neurological diseases.",
