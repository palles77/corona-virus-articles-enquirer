However, the exact mechanism of accumulation of effusion remains unclear. We investigated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to examine the relationship between VEGF levels and the amounts of effusion in cats with FIP. Furthermore, we examined VEGF production in FIPV-infected monocytes/macrophages, and we used feline vascular endothelial cells to examine vascular permeability induced by the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages. In cats with FIP, the production of effusion was related with increasing plasma VEGF levels. In FIPV-infected monocytes/macrophages, the production of VEGF was associated with proliferation of virus. Furthermore, the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages induced hyperpermeability of feline vascular endothelial cells. It was suggested that vascular permeability factors, including VEGF, produced by FIPV-infected monocytes/macrophages might increase the vascular permeability and the amounts of effusion in cats with FIP.",

FCoV is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, and peplomer spike (S) protein (Pedersen, 2009) . FCoV is classified into serotypes I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its S protein (Motokawa et al., 1995 (Motokawa et al., , 1996 . Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: FIPV and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats. In contrast, FIPV infection causes FIP. Stoddart and Scott (1989) reported that the proliferation in macrophages was associated with the virulence of FIPV because FECV exhibited a lower proliferation in macrophages than FIPV. It has been proposed that FIPV arises from FECV by mutation (Chang et al., 2010; Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998) , but the exact mutation and inducing factors have not yet been clarified. Recently, Brown et al. (2009) theoretically demonstrated that FIP develops via the horizontal infection of FIPV. On the basis of their theory, FIPV and FECV are prevalent among cats.",

It has been reported that the potency of VEGF of vascular permeability is 50,000 times stronger than that of histamine (Dvorak et al., 1999) . In patients with inflammatory diseases and cancer, the production of effusion in body cavity was related with increasing plasma VEGF levels and the vascular permeability. For example, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the amounts of synovial fluid related with plasma VEGF level (Fava et al., 1994) . In addition, it has been demonstrated that VEGF is involved in the ascites of patients with ovarian cancer (Hu et al., 2002; Mesiano et al., 1998) . In this study, we observed significantly increased plasma VEGF levels in cats with FIP. We also demonstrated a correlation between plasma VEGF levels and the amounts of effusion in cats with FIP. Specifically, it was strongly suggested that VEGF is involved in effusion in cats with FIP. We investigated FIPV-infected monocytes/macrophages as VEGF-producing cells in cats with FIP. FIPV-infected monocytes/macrophages are major component cells that produce cytokines (TNF-\u2423, IL-1, IL-6, etc.) involved in pathological deterioration (Regan et al., 2009; Takano et al., 2007b Takano et al., , 2009a . Here, we demonstrated that the production of VEGF associated with FIPV proliferation in monocytes/macrophages. The mechanism of FIPVinduced VEGF production is unknown. Regan et al. (2009) reported that FIPV activates p38-MAP kinase (p38-MAPK) to induce TNF-\u2423 production in FIPV-infected monocytes. In addition, p38-MAPK activation induces VEGF production (Yoshino et al., 2006) . In the future, the relationship between p38-MAPK activation and the proliferation of FIPV in monocytes/macrophages should be examined.",

It was reported that VEGF was thermostable (Clauss et al., 1990) . Based on these facts, VEGF may be a vascular permeability-associated factor existing in the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages. To verify this concept, we should examine whether an anti-feline VEGF antibody can inhibit the permeability of feline vascular endothelial cells, induced by the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no antibodies that neutralizes feline VEGF activity. We will create a monoclonal antibody to neutralize feline VEGF and examine whether this antibody can inhibit the vascular permeability induced by the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages. The culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages contained VEGF in a smaller amount (about 20 pg/ml VEGF) than rfVEGF (400 pg/ml). However, it showed increased vascular permeability. Thus, the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages contained vascular permeability factors other than VEGF. According to a recent report, TNF-\u2423 increases the vascular permeability induced by VEGF (Stathopoulos et al., 2007) . Like VEGF, TNF-\u2423 is thermostable (Takano et al., 2007b) . We should also examine whether TNF-\u2423, like VEGF, is involved in the vascular permeability induced by the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages.",

            "text": "A balance between T helper (Th)-1/Th-2 in cats after FIPV infection is critical in examining whether FIPV-infected cats develop FIP. The induction of interferon (IFN)-\u2425, a Th-1 cytokine, inhibits FIP development. In contrast, IL-6, a Th-2 cytokine, promotes FIP devel- opment (Gelain et al., 2006; Goitsuka et al., 1990; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Kiss et al., 2004; Takano et al., 2009a) . Interestingly, VEGF production is inhibited by IFN-\u2425, but increased by IL-6 (Wen et al., 2003; Feurino et al., 2007) . In this study, plasma VEGF lev-els were not increased in cats that did not develop FIP. In contrast, plasma VEGF levels were increased in cats that developed FIP. Based on these findings, plasma VEGF levels may reflect the immune status of FIPV-infected cats. VEGF is reportedly involved in the increased vascular permeability of Orf virus and Hantavirus as well as FIPV (Lyttle et al., 1994; Gavrilovskaya et al., 2008) . It has been demonstrated that Orf virus carries a gene encoding a VEGF homolog, and that VEGF produced by the virus increases the permeability of vascular endothelial cells (Lyttle et al., 1994) . No gene encoding a VEGF-like protein could be found in the FIPV viral genome (data not shown). Specifically, unlike Orf virus, FIPV may not produce VEGF. On the other hand, Hantavirus reportedly shows increased susceptibility to VEGF and increased vascular permeability in virus-infected vascular endothelial cells (Gavrilovskaya et al., 2008) . It is unknown whether FIPV infects vascular endothelial cells. No report has been published on FIPV antigen detection from the vascular endothelial cells of cats with FIP. However, we demonstrated that FIPV proliferated in vascular endothelial cells into which a high-titer FIPV 79-1146 strain was inoculated (Takano and Hohdatsu, unpublished data) . The effects of FIPV infection on vascular endothelial cells should be investigated in the future.",

To elucidate the pathology of FIP, it is desirable to conduct experiments using feline vascular endothelial cells. However, no report has been published on the use of feline vascular endothelial cells in FIP research. One of the reasons for this, no feline vascular endothelial cell line is available. In addition, as experienced in this study, a method to isolate vascular endothelial cells from SPF cats requires many cats and skills. Even if cells are successfully isolated, their use in experiments is limited by the number of passages. When a feline vascular endothelial cell line is established, it will allow the easy handling of cells and may facilitate further elucidation of the mechanism of pathological deterioration in FIP.",
