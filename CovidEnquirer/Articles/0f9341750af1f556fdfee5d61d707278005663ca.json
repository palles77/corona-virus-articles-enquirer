However no definite history of contact with livestock was found in this case. The patient also did not feed or eat poultry at households. Some other confirmed cases had close contact with poultry or with associated environment. It is interesting to note that the virus has also been found in a pigeon in a market in Shanghai. It is unclear how this case was infected by H7N9 AIV, similar to some other cases without known recent close contact with birds or poultry. However, influenza A H7 viruses are a group of influenza viruses that normally circulate among birds and the influenza A (H7N9) virus is one subgroup among the larger group of H7 viruses. 6 Although the patient denied close contact with poultry, H7N9 virus was detected among poultry at local market. The most likely source of the virus in this case seems to be from the environment or food contaminated with this novel virus. The emergence of H7N9 AIV infections in humans suggests the avian influenza virus evolves to achieve adaptations including the ability to bind to mammalian cells and to break the species barrier. Fortunately, among close contacts of this case, the patient's husband was pyretic with a temperature of 38 6 C, but negative for H7N9 AIV detection and recovered soon, indicating no evidence of human-to-human transmission up to this point. At this time there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. The possibility of animal-to-human transmission is being investigated, as is the possibility of person-to-person transmission.",

Meanwhile, due to unclear cause of the disease, fatal cases, including this patient, had not been given the anti-influenza drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir) as soon as possible and within 2,4 days of disease onset, leading to loss of valuable salvage time for the severe cases. Since the laboratory testing conducted in China has shown that the influenza A (H7N9) viruses are sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir, and if these drugs are given early in the course of illness and the patients are hospitalized earlier, the survival rate of this new emerging infectious disease might be significantly improved. Future strategies to prevent fatal cases should include prompt laboratory diagnosis and early antiviral and steroid treatment, and good supportive care.",
