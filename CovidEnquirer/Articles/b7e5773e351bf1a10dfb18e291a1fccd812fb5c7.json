Nucleoside chemistry has also evolved to facilitate efficient routes to effective agents for the treatment of viral diseases caused by HIV [6] and herpes viruses [7] .

Thus, cyano ribofuranose nucleosides have been reported as interesting antiviral agents [12e14] , while replacement of the hydroxyl group of 1-b-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) by the cyano group led to a new biologically active compound [15, 16] , with a novel mechanism of anticancer action [17] .",

Treatment of the 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-a-D-ribo-hexofuranos-3-ulose (1) [32] with sodium cyanide in a two-phase ethylether/H 2 O system, in the presence of sodium bicarbonate, afforded the thermodynamically more stable gluco cyanohydrin epimer 2, in a virtually quantitative yield [33, 34] . The assignment of its configuration was further supported by NOE measurements, as depicted in Fig. 1 . A 5% NOE enhancement of H-2 and a 7% NOE enhancement of H-5 on irradiation of the proton of the free OH group show that these protons are on the same side of the ring system. Hydrolysis of 2 using Amberlite IR 120 (H \u00fe ) resin in methanol followed by acetylation using acetic anhydride (Ac 2 O) in pyridine [32] led to the 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-acetyl-3-C-cyano-Dglucopyranose (4). The protected, 1-(2 0 ,3 0 ,4 0 ,6 0 -tetra-O-acetyl-3 0 -Ccyano-b-D-glucopyranosyl) pyrimidine nucleosides 5aed were obtained upon coupling of the precursor material 4 with silylated 5-fluorouracil, uracil, thymine and N 4 -benzoylcytosine, respectively, in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluomethane-sulfonate (Me 3 SiOSO 2 CF 3 ), in refluxing acetonitrile [35] . The 1 H NMR spectra obtained for the protected nucleosides 5aed, showed large coupling constants between protons H-1 0 and H-2 0 (J 1 0 ,2 0 \u00bc 9.4e9.6 Hz), indicating an axial orientation of both protons and equatorially oriented base rings. Fully deprotection of 5aed, performed by saturated methanolic ammonia [36] , gave the desired nucleosides 6aed.",
