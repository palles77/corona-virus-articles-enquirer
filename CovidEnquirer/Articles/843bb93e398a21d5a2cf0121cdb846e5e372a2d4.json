            "text": "This study employed a multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to model the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets in quiescent air. The approach is featured with a continuity equation being explicitly solved for water vapor, which allows comprehensively considering the effects of inhomogeneous humidity field on droplets evaporation and movement. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations based on the approach achieved a satisfactory agreement with the theoretical models reported in the literature. The results demonstrated that the evaporation-generated vapor and super-saturated wet air exhaled from the respiratory tracks forms a \"vapor plume\" in front of the respiratory track opening, which, despite the short life time, significantly impedes the evaporation of the droplets captured in it. The study also revealed that due to the droplet size reduction induced by evaporation, both the number density of airborne droplets and mass concentration of inhalable pathogens remarkably increased, which can result in a higher risk of infection. Parametric studies were finally conducted to evaluate the factors affecting droplet evaporation. Summary: The study demonstrated the importance of considering inhomogeneous humidity field when modelling the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets. The multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian model presented in this study provides a comprehensive approach to address different influential factors in a wide parametric range, which will enhance the assessment of the health risks associated with droplet exposure.",

[2] , the droplets generated from human coughing, sneezing and talking are mostly between 1 nm and 500 \u03bcm. The diameter is a critical parameter determining the fate of the droplets because droplets larger than 100 \u03bcm would quickly settle while those smaller than 100 \u03bcm could become airborne and have the chance to be inhaled [3] . For airborne droplets, their movement could be dominated by the inertial and gravitational effects or the airflow, depending on the droplet size and air velocity [4] . In addition, studies on particle deposition in human airways [5] have proven that particles larger than 10 \u03bcm tend to impact onto the surface of upper airways while those smaller than 10 \u03bcm are more likely to penetrate deeper into the lower airways and pulmonary region. Some investigators [2, 3] hence recommended 10 \u03bcm as a cut-off diameter to delineate upper and lower respiratory tract infections. Apparently, appropriate characterization of droplet size is of great importance to the assessment of health risks based on droplet trajectories [6] , and to the analyses of individual health hazards associated with particulate exposure.",

This process is strongly controlled by the droplets specific area and ambient conditions including the air temperature, humidity and turbulence. The calculation by Wei and Li [13] revealed that a droplet with an initial diameter of 10 \u03bcm needed only 0.07 s to reach its equilibrium diameter in dry air (0% relative humidity, RH) while a 100-\u03bcm droplet required over 100 s to complete the same process in 90% RH air. Given that the size of a droplet significantly determines its movement and fate, plus the fact that the viability of viruses within the droplet is affected by the moisture content and temperature [3, 14] , an effective modelling of the time-dependent droplet size is crucial to the assessment of health risks associated with droplets exposure, for both the public and individual interests.",

            "text": "Despite the importance of droplets in transmitting respiratory disease has long been recognized, the theoretical models and experimental data on respiratory droplets are still very scarce, particularly in terms of the evaporation and dispersion. The classic Wells evaporation-falling curve (1934) [15] was widely used to estimate the droplet size as a function of time. However, Xie et al. [16] suspected that the curve was plotted based on experimental results through extrapolation using various inappropriate assumptions. In recent years, a couple of mathematic models [7, 9, 13, 16] were developed in which the effects of respiratory jets, air turbulence, droplet salinity and ambient humidity were partially considered. However, most of these models simply ignored the inhomogeneous humidity field induced by the evaporating droplets and the supersaturated water vapor exhaled from the respiratory tracts. Although some theoretical models, such as that of Chao and Wan [17] , employed a transportable scalar to model the concentration diffusion of water vapor in air, the effects of inhomogeneous water vapor concentration on droplet evaporation were not fully addressed. In fact, the inhomogeneous vapor concentration, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the droplets, may have a strong effect on the droplet trajectories through changing the time-size relationship. In addition, the transport characteristics of water vapor in the air may be subjected to many factors including the air pressure and temperature, as well as the vapor concentration itself [18] . A transportable scalar may be inappropriate to model the transport behaviours. This is particularly true when the local vapor concentration is high. In order that droplet evaporation and transport could be modelled in a systematic way, the diffusion of water vapor in the air needs to be modelled mechanistically.",

The figures also reveal that the evaporation of droplets is sensitive to the both parameters considered here. Firstly, the evaporation rate is strongly affected by the droplet size. Smaller droplets evaporate much faster than larger droplets because of the enlarged specific surface area for heat and mass transfer. Secondly, the relative humidity of air plays an important role. When the relative humidity increased from 0% to 90%, the time required for the droplets to reach their equilibrium diameters tremendously increased from 0.065s to 0.45s (692% increment) for the 10-\u03bcm droplets and from 4.0s to 28.0s (700% increment) for the 100-\u03bcm droplets.",

With such small mass flow rates, it was safe to ignore the effects of inhomogeneous humidity field [6] . However, coughing is featured with an instantaneous pulse airflow carrying water vapor and droplets coming from the respiratory tracts. Due to the supersaturated wet air (5% water vapor) and droplets evaporation, the respiratory droplets are factually dispersed in a heterogenous humidity field, particularly in the region close to the respiratory tract openings (mouth and nostrils). Apart from that, many other factors including the mass of exhaled droplets, the ambient temperature and humidity could have significant effects on the process of droplet evaporation, resulting in different time-size correlation and droplet dispersion trajectories. In this section, parametric studies were performed to evaluate the effects of each individual factor. In order to capture the dynamic characteristics of cough and droplets evaporation, transient simulations were conducted. A pulse air jet representing a single cough was applied at the nozzle according to the experimental data of Gupta et al. [19] . The pulse air jet had a time duration of 0.5 s and a peak flow rate of 4.2 L/s at t = 0.08 s (Fig. 3(a) ), which generated a peak air velocity of 13.4 m/s at the nozzle. Droplets were injected into the domain with the same instantaneous velocity of the pulse airflow. Given that the droplets expelled by human cough are dispersed in a wide size range, the number and mass probability density distributions of droplets between 3 and 750 \u03bcm (Fig. 3(b) ), which were measured 10 mm in front of the mouth opening by Chao et al. [24] , were employed to specify the droplet injection conditions. It was noticed from Fig. 3 (b) that over 80% of the droplets expelled by a human cough are smaller than 30 \u03bcm. However, these small droplets only account for around 0.1% of the expelled liquid mass.",

The predicted transient air velocity vectors and water vapor concentration contours in a small rectangular area (2 m-length \u00d7 1.2 m-height) next to the nozzle are shown in Fig. 4 (Case 3) . The results revealed that the cough created a strong pulse air jet, which, however, quickly faded away in the quiescent air. The maximum air velocity decreased from 13.3 m/s at t = 0.08 s s down to 1.16 m/s at t = 0.5 s, 0.25 m/s at t = 2.0 s and further down to 0.10 m/s at t = 8.0 s. The cough also remarkably elevated the local air humidity due to the exhaled wet air, creating an instantaneous \"vapor plume\" in which the vapor concentration is significantly higher than that in the bulk air. Fig. 4 shows that the vapor plume, analogous to the air jet, also quickly dissipated so that at t = 8.0 s no significant gradients of vapor concentration can be observed. However, despite its short life, the vapor plume was found to have a significant effect on the evaporation and dispersion characteristics of droplets, particularly on those of the small droplets. Shown in Fig. 5 are the droplet trajectories predicted without and with vapor transport (Case 1 and 3) , respectively. The results show that the diameter of 100 \u03bcm acted as a critical size for droplet movement as droplets smaller than 100 \u03bcm were steadily suspended in the air and dispersed by the air turbulence, while the movement of droplets larger than 100 \u03bcm was jointly controlled by the gravitational and inertial effects. As shown in Fig. 5 , droplets larger than 100 \u03bcm were free falling and quickly settled onto the floor following smooth trajectories analogous to parabolic curves. The locally elevated air humidity seemed to have no noticeable effects on the trajectories of these large droplets. Thus, the diameter of 100 \u03bcm can be treated as a cut-off size to delineate airborne and free-falling droplets, which is in accordance with the recommendation of Weber and Stilianakis [3] .",

When the transport equation of water vapor (Eq. (4)) was included, the airborne droplets were predicted to have travelled up to 0.65 m at the end of the cough (t = 0.5 s), which was 18% larger than the maximum travelling distance (0.55 m) predicted without vapor transport.

This means that the airborne droplets were completely located in humid air in the following few seconds after a cough, which can certainly hinder their evaporation. Fig. 6 shows the size variation of the 12-\u03bcm droplets after expulsion. When the inhomogeneous humidity field was ignored (Case 1), the droplet median evaporation time was only 0.12 s. The evaporation rates of all the droplets were predicted to be similar, so that the time-dependent droplet sizes were distributed in a narrow area near their average value. In addition, the curves of the average and median sizes were almost overlapping with each other, meaning that the droplets were predicted to evaporate at the same speed. However, when the inhomogeneous humidity field induced by droplets evaporation was considered (Case 2), the median evaporation time was significantly prolonged (0.29 s). The time-dependent droplet sizes were predicted to be dispersed in a much wider range, suggesting different evaporating rates of the droplets despite the same initial diameter. As shown in Fig. 6(b) , some droplets only needed 0.15 s to completely evaporate while some others spent as much as 6.0 s to accomplish the same process. Because of this, the average droplet size was predicted to decrease significantly slower than the median size. Finally, the inclusion of the exhaled humidity further decreased the predicted droplets evaporation rate (Fig. 6(c) ), particularly the droplet median evaporation time was significantly prolonged.",

Comparatively, the time-dependent size of the 112-\u03bcm droplets was not significantly affected by the inhomogeneous humidity field, probably because the travelling speed of this group of droplets was larger than that of vapor dispersion (refer to Figs. 4 and 5) , so that they were travelling outside the vapor plume and their evaporation was not affected by the locally elevated water vapor concentration.

Although the experimental data on how much salivary or phlegmy droplets can be expelled by a single cough is still unavailable in the open literature, it is reasonable to estimate that this amount could be as high as hundreds of milligrams according to the high-speed CCD images (Fig. 8) of Bourouiba et al. [26] . Therefore, computations were conducted with three different droplet masses (10, 100 and 1000 mg) corresponding to mild, moderate and severe coughs, respectively. Fig. 9 shows the contour maps and droplet trajectories predicted with different droplet masses. Only the trajectories of airborne droplets (smaller than 100 \u03bcm) were shown in the figure to improve the illustration clarity. The results firstly revealed that the increased droplet 25  50  0  100  2  Yes  25  50  0  100  3  Yes  25  50  5  100  4  Yes  25  50  5  10  5  Yes  25  50  5  1000  6  Yes  5  50  5  100  7  Yes  15  50  5  100  8  Yes  35  50  5  100  9  Yes  25  10  5  100  10  Yes  25  90  5 100 mass noticeably enlarged the size of the high-humidity area and the maximum vapor concentration in the domain. At t = 2.0 s when the exhaled humidity had fully dispersed, the evaporation of the droplets was still significantly elevating the local humidity. As shown in Fig. 9 (a), the maximum local mass concentration of water vapor reached 1.60% when the droplet mass was 100 mg (Case 3). If the droplet mass could increase up to 1000 mg, the maximum local vapor mass concentration could reach as high as 1.97%, which was the saturated water vapor concentration in the air at the given temperature and pressure conditions (25\u00b0C and 101.325 kPa). The increased droplet mass also changed the droplet trajectories. As shown in Fig. 9 (b) , the gravitational settlement of droplets became more significant. Particularly, when the mass flow rate of droplets increased to 1000 mg, the droplets presented a remarkably changed distribution pattern, which will certainly result in different risk assessments if the assessments were based on droplet trajectories [27] . The time-dependent sizes of the representative droplets (12-\u03bcm and 112-\u03bcm) are shown in Fig. 10 . The results demonstrated that the increased droplet mass significantly prolonged the median evaporation time of the 12-\u03bcm droplets. The time required for 50% of the 12-\u03bcm droplets to completely evaporate was 0.42, 0.56 and 1.26 s, respectively, when the exhaled droplet mass was 10, 100 and 1000 mg.

When the ambient temperature increased from 5C\u00b0to 35C\u00b0, the median evaporation time of the 12-\u03bcm droplets decreased from 1.44 s down to 0.42 s (71% decrease). Although under all the 4 selected ambient temperatures, the 113-\u03bcm droplets did not fully evaporate as they settled quickly onto the floor, their final median size decreased to 95, 91, 77 and 70 \u03bcm, respectively, when hitting the floor (Fig. 11) , Fig. 8 . Droplets expulsion by a human cough [26] . indicating significant evaporation. The ambient humidity also has a strong effect on the rate of droplet evaporation. As shown in Fig. 12 , when the ambient relative humidity decreased from 90% to 10%, not only the median evaporation time of the 12-\u03bcm droplets significantly dropped from 3.15 s down to 0.33 s, but also 50% of the 112-\u03bcm droplets were completely evaporated within 9 s and became steadily airborne. However, the 112-\u03bcm droplets only slightly evaporated in the RH 90% air, so that their median diameter was still 108 \u03bcm when hitting the floor, which was only 3.5% smaller than their initial size. According to Figs. 11 and 12, it seems that the ambient humidity plays a more important role in affecting the rate of droplet evaporation than the ambient temperature does.",

            "text": "The computational results shew that due to the evaporation-induced size reduction, some large free-falling droplets (larger than 100 \u03bcm) could become airborne (smaller than 100 \u03bcm) and hence improve the number density of inhalable droplets in the domain (Fig. 13) . Some of these new airborne droplets and nuclei could be entrained into the breathing zone by uprising airflows such as the human thermal plume. Due to the large mass of pathogens carried in these type of new airborne droplets/nuclei, the possibility of infection can be significantly increased. Similarly, some small airborne droplets could further shrink in size, becoming smaller than 10 \u03bcm and increasing the probability of lower respiratory tracts infections [5] . Fig. 14 shows the time-dependent number fraction of airborne droplets/nuclei (smaller than 100 \u03bcm). The mass fraction of inhalable pathogen, which is defined as the pathogen carried by the airborne droplets/nuclei, is also shown in the figure. It was demonstrated that although the airborne droplets took a predominant number proportion (0.90) of the exhaled droplets, they only accounted for a very small mass fraction (2.18 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) of the total mass of expelled pathogen. When the ambient relative humidity was medium ( Fig. 14(a) , RH 50%), although the total number fraction of inhalable droplets/nuclei and total mass fraction of inhalable pathogen did not change till 10 s after the cough, the number fraction of small droplets/nuclei (smaller than 10 \u03bcm) increased from 0.60 to 0.87 while the mass fraction of the inhalable pathogens carried by them significantly increased from 4.89 \u00d7 10 \u22127 to 1.58 \u00d7 10 \u22124 , which was an astonishing 323-fold increase. When the ambient air had a low relative humidity (RH 10%), the evaporation of droplet was significantly accelerated. As shown in Fig. 14 (b) , at time t = 10 s, 91.5% of the exhaled droplets had become airborne, among which 87% were smaller than 10 \u03bcm. Correspondingly, the mass fraction of inhalable pathogens sharply increased to 5.05 \u00d7 10 \u22124 with 4.89 \u00d7 10 \u22124 being carried by the droplets/nuclei smaller than 10 \u03bcm. Compared with the 2.18 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mass fraction yielded from the medium (50%) relative humidity (Case 3), the 5.05 \u00d7 10 \u22124 mass fraction predicted with the low (10%) relative humidity (Case 9) was more than 2 times larger. Given that the morbidity of many respiratory diseases is strongly related to the exposure dose [28] , it is expected that the elevated mass concentration of the inhalable pathogen in the air could increase the probability of infection, particularly increase the risk of lower respiratory tract infections. This may also give a useful clue to the mystery why influenza always breaks out in winters [3, 29] because of the lower relative humidity in winters.",

When the transport of evaporation-induced water vapor and exhaled water vapor was progressively included in the computational model, the predicted median evaporation time of the 12-\u03bcm droplets significantly increased. It was demonstrated that the exhaled water vapor can form a \"vapor plume\" in front of the respiratory tract opening. Despite its short life time (only a few seconds), the vapor plume is big enough to contain all the airborne droplets and significantly impedes their evaporation. Consequently, the airborne droplets were predicted to travel faster when the inhomogeneous humidity diffusion was included. Comparatively, the evaporation of droplets larger than 100 \u03bcm is insensitive to the vapor plume, probably because their travelling speed is larger than the dispersion speed of the vapor plume so that they are mostly located outside the vapor plume.",
