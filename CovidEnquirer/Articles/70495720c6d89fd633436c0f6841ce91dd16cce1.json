This allows comparison of circulating influenza strains with vaccine strains in the current influenza season, and may provide potential vaccine strains for future seasons.",

ILI GP sentinel surveillance, with laboratory support, has been conducted in Melbourne, Australia since 1998 using an ILI case definition of fever (or feverishness), cough and fatigue (or malaise). 9 Numeric thresholds, based on a comparison of sentinel ILI surveillance with hospital admissions for laboratory confirmed or clinically diagnosed influenza, have been developed that range from normal seasonal activity through to higher-than-expected seasonal activity and epidemic activity. 10 The thresholds were developed retrospectively and have been applied prospectively.",

The probability of eventually signalling an alarm is 1.0 for all sequential tests, so that the Type 1 error rate will eventually be 100% and the Type 2 error rate will eventually be 0%. 20 In the context of this study, the run length is the number of weeks until a signal; ideally, this should be large when there is normal seasonal activity (i.e. low false-alarm rate) and small when there is higher-than-expected seasonal activity (i.e. high power). Average run lengths for different values of h can be estimated using simulations, Markov chains or, in certain circumstances, by approximating formulae. 21 Simulations were used for this study. Briefly, data sets of 10,000 weeks (under the assumptions of normal seasonal activity or 20% higher) were specified and iterated 10,000 times to obtain estimates of the average (median) run length to true and false alarms.",

This is different from the use of CUSUM in industry, where after a signal, the machine (say) is recalibrated and known to be 'in control' and therefore monitoring restarts at h \u00bc 0. 18 The use of CUSUM in this paper corresponds with Phase 1 of calibration used for quality control in the industrial context, which is largely descriptive and involves setting the parameters of the systems such as estimating seasonally adjusted, baseline (in-control) values (Y i ) and confirming a suitable value for h. 15",
