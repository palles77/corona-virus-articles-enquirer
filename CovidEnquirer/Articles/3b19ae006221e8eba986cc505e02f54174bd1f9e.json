Previous studies have shown that the PRRSV nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) is an important mediator of this process, but the underlying molecular details remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that the PRRSV nsp4 interacted with the mitochondrial inner membrane protein cytochrome c1 (cyto.c1) and induced its proteolytic cleavage. Interestingly, the cleaved N-terminal fragment of cyto.c1 was found to exert apoptotic activity, which could cause mitochondrial fragmentation, resulting in apoptotic cell death. And RNA interference (RNAi) silencing experiments further confirmed the crucial role which cyto.c1 played in nsp4-and PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis. Thus, our data provide an important piece of mechanistic clues for PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis and also elucidate a novel mechanism for the 3C-like proteases in this finding.",

One biological property of PRRSV that contributes to viral pathogenesis is the induction of apoptotic cell death, a mechanism that can occur in various tissues, including lungs, testes, lymph nodes and thymus (Sur et al. 1997 (Sur et al. , 1998 Sirinarumitr et al. 1998; Feng et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2011 Wang et al. , 2013 He et al. 2012) . In particular, the HP-PRRSV infections often cause severe thymus atrophy of piglets, leading up to 90% reduction in size characterized by cortical depletion of thymocytes and a significant drop of the CD4 + CD8 + subpopulation (Wang et al. 2011; He et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2013; Li et al. 2014a) . PRRSV infections also result in apoptosis of macrophages in lungs and lymph nodes as well as the germ cells in testes (Sur et al. 1997 (Sur et al. , 1998 Sirinarumitr et al. 1998; Li et al. 2014a) . It is now well established that PRRSV actively induces cell apoptosis both in vivo and in cell culture (Sur et al. 1997 (Sur et al. , 1998 Sirinarumitr et al. 1998; Choi and Chae 2002; Kim et al. 2002; Labarque et al. 2003; Miller and Fox 2004; Wang et al. 2014) .",

In the plasmid pGBKT7-nsp4, nsp4 was fused to the sequence coding for the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, whereas in the plasmid pHA-nsp4, it was in frame with the sequence for a HA epitope tag at its 5\u00b4 end. The recombinant plasmids pFlag-cyto.c1, pFlag-cyto.c1 (aa 1-230) and pFlag-cyto.c1 (aa 231-327) were generated by cloning the genes coding for pig cyto.c1 and the corresponding fragments into the vector pCMV-3\u00d7Flag. Cyto.c1 and its derivatives were expressed by fusion to an N-terminal Flag epitope tag. The plasmid pGADT7-cyto.c1 was made by cloning the pig cyto.c1 gene into the plasmid pGADT7 AD (Clontech, CA, USA). Cyto.c1 was fused to the activation domain of GAL4.

Recently, the viral replicase protein nsp4 was reported to be a strong apoptosis inducer (Ma et al. 2013) . Our studies on screening of viral components revealed the similar finding (Yuan et al. 2016) . To seek the further clue for how PRRSV nsp4 might induce cell apoptosis, we turned to look for its cellular binding partners. We employed a Yeast Two-Hybrid System to screen a cDNA library generated from the porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) ). There were 15 binding partners identified from the initial screening (Table 1) , and one of them was cyto.c1, a key constituent in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Hunte et al. 2003) . There were three reasons why cyto.c1 was selected for further study. Firstly, it has been reported that PRRSV can induce cell apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated pathway (Lee and Kleiboeker 2007) . Secondly, cyto.c1 has been shown to be involved in cell apoptosis (Zhu et al. 2012) . Thirdly, the sequence alignments show that cyto.c1 is highly conserved among human, pigs and monkeys (data not shown).",

Since nsp4 possesses the protease activity, this result suggests that the fast migration band may be from the proteolytic cleavage by nsp4. This hypothesis was further confirmed by the following assays. Firstly, as shown in Fig. 2 -A, the Flag-ctyo.c1 in HEK293T cells were co-expressed with gradually increasing amount of HA-nsp4. And the cleavage of cyto.c1 was dependent on nsp4 in a dose-dependent manner, which suggested a critical role of nsp4 in the cleavage. Secondly, we introduced point mutations to the nsp4 catalytic triad His39-Asp64-Ser118 to construct three mutants: HA-nsp4 H39A, HA-nsp4 D64A, and HA-nsp4 S118A (Fig. 2-B) . When tested in HEK293T cells, all three mutants failed to cleave cyto.c1 (Fig. 2-B) , suggesting that the protease activity of nsp4 is required for the cleavage. In line with inability to cleave cyto.c1, the nsp4 catalytic mutants failed to induce cell apoptosis in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 2-C) .",

If nsp4 is directly involved in cleaving cyto.c1, mutating the nsp4 cleavage sites should be able to block the cleavage. Previous studies have shown that the PRRSV 3C-like serine protease has a strong preference for glutamic acid at P1 position of its substrate (Ziebuhr et al. 2000) . As the cleaved product of cyto.c1 had a migration size of more than 20KD when probed with antibodies to the N-terminal tag, it suggests that the cleavage site is likely localized within the second half of cyto.c1. Bioinformatics analysis revealed 5 potential cleavage sites within this region (data not shown), including E230|G231, E252|V253, E254|F255, E280|P281, and E282|H283. Subsequently, we introduced an E to A mutation to each of these sites in the coding sequence of Flag-cyto.c1. When tested in 293HEK T cells, only the E230A mutation conferred resistance to the nsp4-mediated cleavage (Fig. 2-E) , suggesting that the cleavage takes places between E230 and G231. Consistent with this, the N-terminal fragment cyto.c1 aa 1-230 displayed the same migration rate as the fast-moving species on the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2-F) .",

G, nsp4-induced cleavage does not depend on caspase-3 activation. Transfected HEK293 T cells expressing nsp4 and cyto.c1 were either treated with Z-VAD-FMK or untreated (left). Meanwhile, the untransfected cells were treated with STS at 6 h before cells were harvested. At 30 h post transfection, the cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with indicated antibodies. H, PRRSV HB-1/3.9 nsp4 induces cleavage of cyto.c1. HEK293 T cells were transfected to co-express cyto.c1 and nsp4 from PRRSV strain HB-1/3.9, and the cleavage was analyzed by Western blot analysis of the whole cell lysate.",

In addition to the full-length cyto.c1, we observed the appearance of a fast-moving species of cyto.c1 at the late stage of PRRSV infection (Fig. 3) , a time point that is coincident with the nsp4 expression and the caspase-3 activation. Moreover, this band was not due to the degradation by cellular proteases during cell disruption, as we did not see the same phenomenon in the mock-infected cells (Fig. 3, left panel) . This result indicated that the fast-moving band should be from PRRSV infection, consistent with the above observation that nsp4 could mediate the cyto.c1 cleavage.",

Previous studies have revealed that the 3C or 3C-like proteases play a critical role in the apoptosis induction (Barco et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2006; Zaragoza et al. 2006; Ma et al. 2013; Yuan et al. 2016) . A salient example is coxaschievirus B3 3Cpro that targets I\u03baB for cleavage (Zaragoza et al. 2006) . The cleaved fragment then translocates into nucleus and forms a stable complex with NF-\u03baB to inhibit its transactivation, leading to cell apoptosis (Zaragoza et al. 2006) . In this study, our data show that the arterivirus 3Cpro uses a different mechanism by directly targeting a mitochondrial protein cyto.c1. Cyto.c1 is one of the key constituents of multimeric complex III (bc1 complex) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In the complex, the N-terminus of cyto.c1 faces the mitochondrial inter-membrane space and interacts with cytochrome c (Hunte et al. 2003; Crofts 2004) . This interaction ensures the transfer of electrons from complex II to cytochrome c. Also, the bc1 complex is the major pathway for free radical generation within mitochondria (Cape et al. 2007) . Previously, it was reported that PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis involves in the intrinsic (mitochondria) pathway (Lee and Kleiboeker 2007) . Our studies here suggest that the mitochondria pathway plays an important role in PRRSV-induced apoptosis of MARC-145 cells, as knockdown of cyto.c1 greatly (about 80%) reduced PRRSV-induced caspase-3 activation ( Fig. 6-C) .",

            "text": "Screening of viral components revealed that PRRSV nsp4 is a strong apoptosis inducer (Ma et al. 2013; Yuan et al. 2016) . Mechanistically, our data support the notion that the proteolytic cleavage of cyto.c1 is a critical event for nsp4-induced cell apoptosis. There are several lines of evidence supporting this conclusion. First, the protease activity is absolutely required for nsp4-induced cell apoptosis ( Fig. 2-C) . Although it is possible that the mutations might affect an unknown function of nsp4 in addition to the protease activity, it is less likely that all three independent, relatively conserved mutations affect this single unknown function. Second, nsp4 induces specific cleavage of cyto.c1. This conclusion is derived by the key facts that the reaction was dose-dependent on nsp4 (Fig. 2-A) and that mutagen-esis of either the nsp4 catalytic site (Fig. 2-B ) or the nsp4 recognition site (Fig. 2-E) in cyto.c1 prevented the cleavage. Third, the cleaved N-terminal fragment ctyo.c1 (aa 1-230) has a remarkable ability to induce apoptosis compared to the full-length cyto.c1 (Fig. 4) . Moreover, in the singly transfected mammalian cells, expression of ctyo.c1 (aa 1-230) causes mitochondria fragmentation with severely reduced mitochondria staining by mitotracker (Fig. 5) , indicating that the cleaved fragment is detrimental to mitochondria. Interestingly, the property of cyto.c1 (aa 1-230) is well in line with a recent report regarding the feature of a cleaved form of cyto.c1 (Zhu et al. 2012) . In that study, cyto.c1 was identified as a novel substrate for the activated caspase-3. The authors found that, during apoptosis, the activated caspase-3 can feed back to cleave cyto.c1 at the site of D106|H107 to release an N-terminal fragment cyto.c1 (aa 1-106). This fragment turned out to be detrimental and could cause further amplification of cyto.c release from mitochondrial to cytosol. When expressed alone in transfected cells, cyto.c1 (aa 1-106) results in profound mitochondria fragmentation and loss of membrane potential, leading to mitochondrial catastrophe (Zhu et al. 2012) . However, this specific cleavage by caspase-3 could be abrogated by caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Interestingly, we did not detect the cleaved fragment by caspase-3 either in PRRSV-infected or in transfected cells. On the other hand, since cyto.c1 (aa 1-230) contains the sequence of cyto.c1 (aa 1-106), it is not surprising that the two share the similar property. However, cyto.c1 (aa 1-230) appears more detrimental than cyto.c1 (aa 1-106) since the cells expressing cyto.c1 (aa 1-230) lose most of the mitotracker staining (Fig. 5) while the latter does not (Zhu et al. 2012 ). Nevertheless, these indicate that PRRSV hijacks a cellular mechanism to induce cell apoptosis.",

This result is in stark contrast to the fact that HP-PRRSV strains induce much more pronounced cell apoptosis in multiple organs of pigs Guo et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014 ). However, this discrepancy can at least be partly explained by the much higher replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV strains in macrophages and pigs as well as the expanded tropism Li et al. 2014b) . For the latter, HP-PRRSV has been reported to cause thymus atrophy but the low pathogenic PRRSV rarely does so Guo et al. 2013) . Unfortunately, since the protease activity is absolutely required for viral replicase maturation, it is difficult to directly test the role of nsp4 in virus-induced apoptosis by reverse genetics, unless specific residues important for the nsp4-cyto.c1 interaction can be identified. This task will be , HeLa (B) or MARC-145 (C) cells grown on coverslips in six-well plates were transfected when 60-70% to express Flag-cyto.c1 and its derivatives. At 18-24 h post-transfection, the cells were first stained with mitotracker, and then fixed, permeablized, and stained with antibodies to Flag followed by Alex-488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Fab fragment.

And previous studies suggested that PRRSV nsp4 was responsible, but the exact molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induction are unclear. The major finding of this report is that the PRRSV nsp4 interacts with ctyo.c1 and target the E230|G231 site of cyto.c1 to mediate its proteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, the cleaved N-terminal fragment of cyto.c1 was found to possess apoptotic activity that causes mitochondrial fragmentation, leading to apoptotic cell death. In addition, the RNAi silencing experiment suggests that cyto.c1 is critical for both PRRSV-and nsp4-induced apoptosis. Thus, our data provide a mechanistic clue for PRRSV-induced cell apoptosis and also indicate a novel mechanism for the 3C-like proteases in induction of apoptotic cell death. Cytochrome c1 (cyto.c1) is critical for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV)-and nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4)-induced cell apoptosis. A, MARC-145 cells were transfected with either siRNAs targeting cyto.c1 or scrambled siRNA (siRNA-NC). At 48 h post transfection, the cells were subject to SDS-PAGE and analyzed with immunoblotting with antibodies to cyto.c1 and \u03b2-actin. B, MARC-145 cells were first transfected with either siRNA-NC or siRNA-3. At 24 h post transfection, the cells were infected with HP-PRRSV strain JXwn06 at an MOI of 0.1. At 48 h post infection, the cells were harvested and subject to either FACS analysis with PI or FITC-conjugated annexin V. C, the same as B, except that the cells were used for western blot analysis with antibodies to caspase-3, nsp4 and \u03b2-actin. D, the same as B, except that the cells were transduced with the lentivirus expressing nsp4-GFP. The experiments are representative of three independent repeats.",
