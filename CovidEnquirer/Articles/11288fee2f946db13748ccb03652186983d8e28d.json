In our trial 1 and the pre vious phase 2 trial, 4 adverse events were very carefully assessed and reported, and no differences between treatment groups were noted. Caution is certainly welcomed until more experience with use of the combination develops worldwide. Our study treated patients with fewer than 20 viable brain cysts, no large cyst masses, no extraparenchymal lesions, and no intracranial hypertension. Treatment of patients with these or other disease characteristics that could be associated with an increased risk of side-eff ects should be done with extreme caution. None of these patients was infected with MERS-CoV; however, 17 (52%) were infected with respiratory viruses. 13 of these virus-positive samples contained influenza virus RNA (seven contained influenza A subtype H3N2, four contained pandemic influenza A subtype H1N1 2009, and two contained infl uenza B); of the remaining positive samples, two contained CoV-229E, one contained human metapneumovirus, and one contained rhinovirus. In summary, 75% of viruses detected in patients returning from the Arabian Peninsula with clinical features compatible with a MERS-CoV were influenza viruses for which a vaccine is theoretically available.",

Another study that systematically screened a cohort of returned French Hajj pilgrims in 2013 showed that eight (6%) of 129 acquired infl uenza virus during the pilgrimage. None was vaccinated against infl uenza in 2013. 3 Accordingly, a substantial proportion of individuals crossing hemispheres, or participating in mass gathering events grouping people from both hemispheres, clearly have no access to vaccine-based prevention of infl uenza because of regulations.",
