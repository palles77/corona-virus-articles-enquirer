We found that syncytin and type I viral envelope proteins shared similar structural profiling, especially in the regions of N-and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR). We expressed the predicted regions of NHR (41 aa) and CHR (34 aa) in syncytin as a native single chain (named 2-helix protein) to characterize it. 2-helix protein exists as a trimer and is highly a-helix, thermo-stable, and denatured by low pH. NHR and CHR could form a proteaseresistant complex. The complex structure built by the molecular docking demonstrated that NHR and CHR associated in an antiparallel manner. Overall, the 2-helix protein could form a thermo-stable coiled coil trimer. The fusion core structure of syncytin was first demonstrated in endogenous retrovirus. These results support the explanation how syncytin mediates cytotrophoblast cell fusion involved in placental morphogenesis.",

It encodes a protein of 538 amino acid residues. Robust syncytin gene expression was observed in placenta [1, 2, 4] . Human placenta contains a specialized cell type called trophoblast cell. At early gestation stage, mononuclear cytotrophoblast cells facing the maternal deciduas differentiate then fuse into a continuous layer of multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast. The syncytiotrophoblast layer is responsible for many functions performed by the placenta including transport of oxygen, nutrients, immune tolerance, and hormone production [5] . The hormone such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) can be used as an indicator of syncytiotrophoblast formation [6] .",

Interestingly, we found that syncytin and HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp) 160 shared similar structural profiling. HIV-1 gp160, a typical type I viral envelope protein, is proteolytically cleaved into two subunits: a surface subunit (gp120, SU) which is responsible for recognizing and binding to specific receptors on the host cell and a transmembrane subunit (gp41, TM) which contains the fusion peptide (FP), N-and C-terminal heptad repeats (NHR and CHR, also called HR1 and HR2). NHR and CHR can interact with each other and form a sixstranded a-helical bundle consisting of an inner triplestranded coiled-coil buttressed by three C-helices, which is the fusion core structure of gp41 and crucial for membrane fusion [8, 9] .",

Just like N36 and C34, both NHR and CHR in syncytin displayed putative coiled-coil structure (Fig. 6) . The potential complex between NHR and CHR was then investigated by using the protein-docking software ZDOCK 2.3. The complex structure built by the docking technique demonstrated that NHR and CHR associated in an antiparallel manner (Fig. 6) . Several hydrophobic interactions occurred between NHR and CHR, e.g., L386 and L375 of NHR interacted with I413 and I421 of CHR, respectively. There might be also several hydrogen bonds existing in the NHR-CHR complex, e.g., T367 and R383 of NHR were hydrogen bonded to R433 and Q410 of CHR, respectively. This model fitted well with an antiparallel dimer of NHR + CHR complex in syncytin, just like those in HIV-1 gp160 and coronavirus spike protein [8, 9, 27, 28] , and provided us putative detailed interactions between NHR and CHR in syncytin.",

Lanes 1, 2, and 3 are corresponding to the samples from the peaks 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Lane 4 is protein marker (kDa) and lane 5 is the purified 2-helix protein (11 kDa). The 2-helix protein (peak 2, 34.4 kDa) was eluted between BSA (peak 1, 67 kDa) and lysozyme (peak 3, 14.4 kDa) protein standards, which demonstrated that the 2-helix protein might form a trimer (3 \u00b7 11 = 33 kDa, closer to 34.4 kDa).",

(B) Thermal denaturing curves recorded at 222 nm from 25 to 90\u00b0C with a scan rate of 1\u00b0C/min. They illustrate that the 2-helix protein was thermostable. (C) Equilibrium isothermal unfolding of the 2-helix protein by acid denaturing. This experiment was performed at 25\u00b0C. The fraction folded of the 2-helix protein (f f ) was calculated as f f = ([h] \u00c0 [h M ])/ ([h T ] \u00c0 [h M ]).
