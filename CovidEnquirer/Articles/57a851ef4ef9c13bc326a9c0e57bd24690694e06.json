The monkeys were inoculated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 0.5, 5, 50, or 5000 g of vaccine, or PBS as control, and boosted on day 7. After 3 weeks, they were challenged with the NS-1 strain of SARS-CoV. The humoral and mucosal immune responses, clinical signs, chemical indices and viremia were monitored following the immunization and challenge. The control animals who received PBS developed atypical SAR-CoV infection after viral challenge, according to clinical, virological and pathological findings. No systematic side effects were observed in vaccinated animals post-immunization, even in at the high dose of 5000 g. The 50 g dosage of vaccine elicited SARS-CoV specific immune responses against viral infection as compared to the partial immunity elicited by 0.5 and 5 g doses. The results show that this inactivated vaccine can induce effective concomitant humoral and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV infection, is safe in monkeys, and the vaccine maybe a good candidate for clinical trials.",

Optical density (OD) of colored product was measured at 450 nm using a plate reader (RT-2100C, Rayto Corporation). The IgG ELISA titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution with an OD value >0.1 and at least 2.1-fold that of the negative control.

According to the summary of the technical meeting on \"SARS ANIMAL MODELS\", which was held on 5-6 February 2004, SARS models for infection (mice, effects and monkeys) are available. However, the development of clinical disease models needs to be further addressed.

No evidence of infection was found in animals receiving the higher dose of vaccine. Three animals induced lower titers of serum IgG antibody or negative nasoparyngeal sIgA antibody responses. This partial protectivity is likely the result of an inadequate or absent humoral response.

In this study, we also demonstrated that the SARS inactivated vaccine can stimulate rhesus monkeys to produce specific antibodies with neutralization activity.
