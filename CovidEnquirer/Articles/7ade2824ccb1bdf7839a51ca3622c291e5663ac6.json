            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly discovered enterotropic swine coronavirus that causes enteritis and diarrhea in piglets. Like other coronaviruses, PDCoV commonly contains 4 major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Among these, the N protein is known to be the most abundant and multifunctional viral component. Therefore, as the first step toward understanding the biology of PDCoV, the present study investigated functional characteristics and expression dynamics of host proteins in a stable porcine cell line constitutively expressing the PDCoV N protein. Similar to N proteins of other coronaviruses, the PDCoV N protein was found to interact with itself to form non-covalently linked oligomers and was mainly localized to the nucleolus. We then assessed alterations in production levels of proteins in the N-expressing PK (PK-PDCoV-N) cells at different time points by means of proteomic analysis. According to the results of high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, a total of 43 protein spots were initially found to be differentially expressed in PK-PDCoV-N cells in comparison with control PK cells. Of these spots, 10 protein spots showed a statistically significant alteration, including 8 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated protein spots and were picked for subsequent protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting following matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The affected cellular proteins that we identified in this study were classified into the functional groups involved in various cellular processes such as cell division, metabolism, the stress response, protein biosynthesis and transport, cytoskeleton networks and cell communication. Notably, two members of the heat shock protein 70 family were found to be up-regulated in PK-PDCoV-N cells. These proteomic data will provide insights into the specific cellular response to the N protein during PDCoV infection.",

In February 2014, the detection of PDCoV was first announced in Ohio, United States, in conjunction with outbreaks of diarrhea without other etiologic agents. Since its emergence, this novel coronavirus has been detected in 17 US states, and almost 80% of the tested samples corresponded to cases of coinfection of PDCoV with other enteric viral pathogens such as a rotavirus or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (Li et al., 2014; UTR. ORF1a/b encompasses two-thirds of the genome encoding 2 overlapping viral replicase polyproteins, 1a and 1ab, which are then proteolytically processed into mature nonstructural proteins. As in other coronaviruses, production of polyproteins 1a and 1ab requires a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift during translation of the genomic RNA. The last third of the genome encodes the 4 structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as two accessory genes, nonstructural gene 6 (NS6) and NS7 gene, between M and N, and within N, respectively (Lai et al., 2007; Lee and Lee, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Marthaler et al., 2014a; Woo et al., 2012) .",

The entire life cycle of coronaviruses takes place in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and accordingly, the N protein is distributed mainly in the cytoplasmic compartments.

The Escherichia coli strain DH5\u2423 (RBC Bioscience, Taiwan) was used as the host for general cloning. The full-length N gene was amplified from the PDCoV KNU14-04 strain (Lee and Lee, 2014) with the following primer pair: KNU14-04-N-Fwd (5 -GCCGGTCGACATGGCTGCACCAGTAG-3 ) and KNU14-04-N-Rev (5 -CGGCTCTAGACGCTGCTGATTCCTGC-3 ), where underlines indicate the SalI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites, respectively. The PCR amplicon was initially inserted into the pBudCE4.1 vector (Invitrogen) that contains a myc epitope and 6 repetitive histidine codons, and the resulting plasmid pBud-PDCoV-N was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Because the PDCoV genome contains one accessory NS7 gene within the N gene in a different reading frame, the presence of NS7 could affect our functional studies of the PDCoV N protein. To prevent any such side effects, the translation initiation codon and the fifth codon of the NS7 ORF were modified to disrupt its expression by pBud-PDCoV-N. To accomplish this, overlapping PCR was conducted to simultaneously change the ATG start codon and the fifth codon of the NS7 gene to TTA and TAA at genomic nucleotide positions 24,096-24,098 and 24,108-24,110, respectively, using pBud-PDCoV-N as a template with the following primers for the T24097C/T24109A mutation: NS7-KO-Fwd (5 -GGCAAcGGAGTTCCGCTaAACTCCGCCATC-3 ) and NS7-KO-Rev (5 -GATGGCGGAGTTtAGCGGAACTCCgTTGCC-3 ), where lowercase letters indicate the mutated nucleotides. Both mutations were translationally silent with respect to the ORF encoding the N protein, and the resulting plasmid pBud-PDCoV-N w/oNS7 was verified by nucleotide sequencing. A fragment of PDCoV N w/oNS7 cDNA that was prepared from pBud-PDCoV-N was then subcloned into the pFB-Neo retroviral vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the SalI and EcoRI restriction sites to construct the PDCoV N gene expression plasmid pFB-Neo-PDCoV-N-myc/His that produces recombinant N protein.",

To date, interactions between this novel virus and the host have not been studied yet. Furthermore, alterations of cellular protein expression in response to PDCoV or each viral protein upon infection currently remain undetermined. In the current study, the PDCoV N protein was chosen in the current study for the proteomic analysis to evaluate specific host cellular responses, which is not only the most abundant viral component but also performs several biological functions in completing viral replication. For this purpose, sublines of PK-15 cells were established to stably express recombinant PDCoV N under the control of a retroviral longterminal-repeat (LTR) promoter. Ten generated cell clones were initially collected and subjected to RT-PCR and Western blotting to confirm the N gene expression at mRNA and protein levels, respectively (data not shown).

After viral infection, the infected cells launch a number of host antiviral defensive responses, which are turned on to eliminate the invading viruses. On the other hand, viruses employ their own evasion strategies to complete their replication and to successfully spread to neighboring cells. This series of interactions between the virus and host results in compensatory modifications in cellular gene production. Accordingly, numerous studies have been extensively conducted by means of various molecular and genomic methods to understand how the altered host gene expression affects viral infection and the associated pathogenic processes. The proteomic analysis coupling high-resolution 2DE and MALDI-TOF/MS is a tool that can generate ample data on cellular protein profiles modified by viral replication. With the proteomic techniques, it is now possible to identify relative changes in protein abundance for evaluation of host cellular Fig. 6 . Differential expression of the HSP70 family in PK-PDCoV-N cells. Cell lysates were prepared from PDCoV N gene-expressing PK cells at indicated time points and immunoblotted to determine the expression profile of each protein with antibodies specific for GRP78 and HSC70 (top to second panels). The blot was also reacted with anti-His tag (third panel) and anti-\u2424-actin (bottom panel) antibodies to confirm the status of N expression and equal protein loading, respectively. Each cellular protein expression was quantitatively analyzed by densitometry in terms of the relative density value to the \u2424-actin gene and PK-PDCoV-N sample results were compared to PK-control results.

In the present work, a proteomic approach was applied for profiling the global protein expression changes in host cells in response to the N protein of PDCoV, which is a major constituent of the virion and infected cells. Therefore, we initially established a porcine cell line stably expressing the PDCoV N protein and then characterized the N protein produced in those cells. Due to the absence of cysteine residues, a disulfide-linked homodimeric N protein of PDCoV was not detected in PK-PDCoV-N cells. Rather, the PDCoV N protein was shown to be self-assembled via non-covalent oligomerization as a structural component for formation of the viral capsid. Interestingly, the N protein of PDCoV was found to be predominantly present in both the cytoplasm and nucleolus of PK-PDCoV-N cells. The localization of nidovirus N proteins to the nucleolus may be necessary for control of RNA synthesis or ribosome biogenesis via association with ribosomal subunits and interaction with nucleolar proteins (Chen et al., 2002; Wurm et al., 2001; Yoo et al., 2003; ) . Similarly, the PDCoV N protein may participate in such a viral strategy to favor viral replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the nucleolar localization sequence detector program (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac. uk/www-nod/) predicted that PDCoV N harbors a putative nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) consisting of a stretch of basic amino acids. Therefore, further research is needed to identify a functional NoLS to confirm the intracellular localization of the PDCoV N protein. These biological characteristics of N gene-expressing cells have yet to be confirmed using an authentic N protein in PDCoVinfected cells, but according to our results, PDCoV N appears to act as a multifunctional protein playing structural and non-structural roles contributing to completion of viral replication. Our proteomic data revealed that 10 differentially expressed cellular proteins are identifiable in PDCoV N gene-expressing porcine cells. The proteins that we identified in this study are involved in diverse cellular processes: metabolism, the stress response, protein biosynthesis and transport, cytoskeleton networks and cell communication, and cell division. The significance of the functional roles of the selected host proteins affected by the interaction of the PDCoV N protein with the host cell is discussed below.",

            "text": "The most interesting finding in the present study is that two cellular chaperone proteins belonging to the HSP70 family are up-regulated concomitantly by the N protein of PDCoV. The first up-regulated protein is GRP78 in cells expressing the PDCoV N protein, which is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In eukaryotic cells, the ER is the major site for synthesis and folding of transmembrane and secreted proteins, and accordingly, animal viruses also use the ER as a site of synthesis and processing of their own proteins. The amount of protein entering the ER can differ under physiological and environmental conditions. If protein synthesis exceeds the folding capacity of the ER, unfolded proteins accumulate there, resulting in ER stress. To maintain the ER homeostasis, cells have developed a signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) that transmits signals across the ER membrane to the cytosol and the nucleus and ultimately reduces protein translation and enhances the ER folding capacity by up-regulating chaperone proteins (Ron and Walter, 2007) . Coronavirus infection of cultured cells is known to cause ER stress and to induce the UPR, which then crosstalks with various cellular signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, autophagy, apoptosis, and innate immune responses, indicating the involvement of UPR activation in virus-host interactions and viral pathogenesis . More interestingly, global proteomic and microarray analyses have shown that the expression of chaperon proteins, such as GRP78 and GRP94, is up-regulated in cells infected with a human coronavirus or in cells expressing the S2 subunit (Jiang et al., 2005; Yeung et al., 2008) . Furthermore, the N protein of PEDV, another porcine coronavirus, overexpression was shown to trigger ER stress (Xu et al., 2013) . Thus, it appears that PDCoV infection may induce ER stress and the UPR, leading to the up-regulation of GRP78 to counteract the ER stress; hence, the N protein may be responsible for this stress response pathway. The second identified HSP70 family protein is HSC70, also known as heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8). HSC70 is a molecular chaperone with multiple functions in protein folding and trafficking in all eukaryotic cells and in protecting cells from apoptosis or a wide array of stressors such as heat and infection (Morano, 2007; Powers et al., 2008; Takayama et al., 1999) . Accumulating evidence has shown that HSC70 plays important roles in certain processes involved in viral infection by modulating cell entry, virion disassembly and assembly, and the cellular antiviral response and apoptosis (Chuang et al., 2015; Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2010; Ivanovic et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2013; Radhakrishnan et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2010) . Apoptosis is considered an innate defense mechanism that limits propagation of a virus by eliminating infected cells (Everett and McFadden, 1999) . Therefore, many viruses have evolved to employ various strategies that inhibit apoptosis in order to prevent premature cell death, thereby securing sufficient time for progeny production. Thus, a conceivable explanation is that PDCoV may take the advantage of suppressing apoptosis by up-regulating HSC70 in the early phase of the infection, and the N protein seems to be involved in this mechanism. In addition, HSC70 mediates the nuclear export of the influenza virus ribonucleoprotein complex via interaction with viral proteins M1 and NS2 (Watanabe et al., 2006 (Watanabe et al., , 2014 . In the present study, we found that PDCoV N can be localized to the nucleolus in Nexpressing cells. On the other hand, N proteins must be trafficked from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm to accomplish nucleocapsid assembly as well as viral RNA synthesis and virus-host interactions. According to our results and existing data, HSC70 may facilitate the export of PDCoV N from the nucleolus to complete the viral life cycle.",

            "text": "Like many other viruses, coronaviruses turn off host protein translation, while continuing to the synthesis of their own gene products to finish viral replication. One of the mechanisms behind this translational suppression is through interaction of the N protein with elongation factor 1\u2423 (EF1\u2423), a major translation factor in mammalian cells . In the present study, the amount of another translational factor, EF2, was affected by the host response to the PDCoV N protein. Although we do not know whether the increased expression of EF2 is related to its binding to PDCoV N, such differential expression of a translation factor may be associated with regulation of both host and viral protein synthesis. We also found that expression of the cytoskeletal protein ezrin is significantly enhanced by the N protein. Ezrin is a member of the ezrin-moesin-radixin (EMR) family of host cytoskeletal proteins that organize the cortical cytoskeleton by mediating interactions between actin and the plasma membrane proteins and function as signal transducers in numerous signaling pathways (Neisch and Fehon, 2011) . The EMR also modulate RNA virus infection by regulating stable and dynamic microtubule formation (Bukong et al., 2013; Haedicke et al., 2008; Naghavi et al., 2007) . Given the biological features of the EMR proteins, the up-regulation of ezrin in our study suggests that the PDCoV N protein may manipulate the host cytoskeletal network and cell signaling, possibly to facilitate the processes of viral infection and replication.",

            "text": "In contrast, the expression of translocon-associated protein subunit delta (TRAPD) is suppressed in cells expressing the PDCoV N protein, according to our results. TRAPD is a part of the TRAP complex that is involved in translocating proteins across the ER membrane and in regulating the retention of ER resident proteins (Fons et al., 2003) . Coronaviruses acquire their lipid envelop via budding of the nucleocapsid through the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (McBride et al., 2014) . The down-regulation of TRAPD may lead to the release of cellular proteins from the ER during PDCoV replication, which in turn, promotes translocation of envelope-associated viral structural proteins to the ER membrane -the site of budding -to facilitate virus assembly. Eukaryotic cells reprogram their metabolism to adapt to stress-induced damage in response to environmental stressors. Among our differentially expressed proteins, some are either directly or indirectly involved in metabolism. One hypothesis that can explain this result is that production of the N protein affects cellular biosynthesis by modulating the expression of metabolism-related proteins, which in turn remodels the intracellular environment for optimal PDCoV replication.",

To resolve these questions as well as performing various PDCoV research, obtaining a Korean PDCoV isolate that can grow in cell culture is necessary; we are currently working on this task. In future studies, we are planning to assess cellular responses to PDCoV by proteomic analysis to validate our present data; the proteins that are differentially expressed in the cells overexpressing PDCoV N or in the cells infected with PDCoV can be analyzed in detail in order to identify their precise function in the replication of PDCoV. On the other hand, one limitation of the proteomic methodology used in this study is the inability to reliably detect low-molecular-weight or low-abundance proteins such as cytokines, which are involved in the host immune response. Therefore, more comprehensive works are also needed to expand our present findings and to explore other proteins that may play a role in host responses to this protein. Nevertheless, the data presented here are expected to advance the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms associated with PDCoV-host interactions and viral pathogenesis.",
