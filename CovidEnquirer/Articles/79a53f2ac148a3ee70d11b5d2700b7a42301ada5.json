The microscopical lesions were villous atrophy in the small intestine, the villous enterocytes being vacuolated and cuboidal in shape. The villus-crypt ratio was severely reduced, varying from 1 : 1 to 3:1. Transmission electron microscopy showed numerous coronaviruses within the cytoplasm of enterocytes and among microvilli. Specific antigens of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) virus were detected in the cytoplasm of enterocytes by the streptavidin-biotin (SAB) technique. Infected cells, which were most abundant in the villous epithelia of the jejunum and ileum, were present in small numbers in the large intestine, the crypt epithelia, the lamina propria and Peyer's patches. The study suggests that the SAB technique is useful for the diagnosis of PED.",

On these farms, vaccines against transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE),Japanese porcine encephalitis, porcine parvovirus infection, swine fever, Aujeszky's disease and swine erysipelas had been in regular use. Piglets were treated for diarrhoea with colistin or oxolinic acid, but without success. TGE was excluded by failure to isolate the virus from the small and large intestine of all 21 piglets on a porcine kidney cell line (CPK cell) and in Vero cell cultures, and by failure to demonstrate elevated neutralizing antibody titres against TGEV in the serum of nine convalescent piglets (19-day-old) on farms 1 and 2 (Table 1) . Rotavirus infection was also excluded by the absence of specific antigen in the intestinal content of all 21 piglets collected, as shown by the Rotaclone Kit (Cambridge Biotech, MA, USA). Bacteriological examination of samples from 13 diarrhoeic piglets (intestinal contents, liver, lung and kidney) failed to reveal pathogenic bacteria.",

Many viral particles were seen in vacuoles or cytoplasmic organelles situated mainly in the supranuclear cytoplasm. Some viruses were seen between the microvilli. The viral particles were pleomorphic, measuring between 70 nm and 140 nm. They were mainly spherical or oval. Mature viruses (100-140 nm diameter) with a number of projections (c. 20 nm) were observed within the membranebounded vacuoles in the enterocytes (Fig. 3) .",

The antigen-containing enterocytes were profuse in the small intestinal mucosa but sparse in the large intestine (Table  2 ; Fig. 4 ). The infected cells in the duodenum were fewer than in the jejunum and ileum but greater than in the caecum and colon. In infected piglets, antigen-containing cells invariably occurred in the jejunum. These infected enterocytes tended to be less numerous in severe (Fig. 2d ) than in moderate (Fig. 4b) villous atrophy. Infected cells were not seen in two piglets that showed severely atrophied villi. Antigen was confined to the cytoplasm, and could not be detected in the nuclei. Most infected cells were not arranged continuously in the epithelial layer (Figs 2d and 4a-d) and the border between infected and uninfected cells was distinct. Infected cells were observed occasionally in the crypts (Fig. 4a ) and in the lamina propria and Peyer's patches in the ileum (Fig. 4c) . PEDV antigen could not be detected in Brunner's glands of the duodenum, stomach or lung, or in the intestine of control animals (a healthy SPF piglet, a piglet experimentally infected with TGEV, and four piglets in which natural TGE had been diagnosed).",

(1981) in pigs experimentally infected with PEDV and examined by the immunofluorescence technique. The site of viral replication of PEDV was clearly different from that of TGEV, which is the small intestine (Hooper and Haelterman, 1966) . In addition, PEDV was absent from the lung, thus differing from porcine respiratory coronavirus (Cox et al., 1990) .",

In the present study, however, the villus-crypt ratio in the most severely affected piglets was 1:1 and the lesions were as severe as those of TGE. Furthermore, villous atrophy was observed in the duodenum, in contrast to the findings of Ducatelle et al. (1981) in experimental pigs. The differences between the results obtained in experimental infection and those in the present study may have been due to differences in the virulence of the strains or in the infecting dose. The number of enterocytes infected with PEDV tended to decrease with increasing severity of villous atrophy. Possibly in piglets with severe villous atrophy, the PEDV may already have left the enterocytes, or the infected cells may already have been eroded. Thus the distribution of PEDV antigens may vary according to the stage of the disease.",
