The transmembrane subunits from the structurally defined \"class I\" glycoproteins adopt an \u03b1-helical \"trimer-of-hairpins\" conformation during the fusion pathway. Here, we present our studies on the envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit, GP2, of the CAS virus (CASV). CASV was recently identified from annulated tree boas (Corallus annulatus) with inclusion body disease and is implicated in the disease etiology. We have generated and characterized two protein constructs consisting of the predicted CASV GP2 core domain. The crystal structure of the CASV GP2 post-fusion conformation indicates a trimeric \u03b1-helical bundle that is highly similar to those of Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2 despite CASV genome homology to arenaviruses. Denaturation studies demonstrate that the stability of CASV GP2 is pH dependent with higher stability at lower pH; we propose that this behavior is due to a network of interactions among acidic residues that would destabilize the \u03b1-helical bundle under conditions where the side chains are deprotonated. The pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion structure has been observed in Ebola virus and Marburg virus GP2, as well as other viruses that enter via the endosome. Infection experiments with CASV and the related Golden Gate virus support a mechanism of entry that requires endosomal acidification. Our results suggest that, despite being primarily arenavirus like, the transmembrane subunit of CASV is extremely similar to the filoviruses.",

            "text": "Infection by enveloped viruses, whose infectious particles are surrounded by a lipid bilayer, requires fusion of the host cell and viral membranes; this process is facilitated by one or more viral envelope glycoproteins [1] . Although details of this mechanism vary among viruses, viral glycoproteins typically consist of a surface subunit, which binds to a host cell receptor, and a transmembrane subunit responsible for drawing host and viral membranes together via the formation of a stable post-fusion conformation [2] . The \"class I\" viral fusion proteins, which include those of the human immunodeficiency viruses, influenza, Ebola viruses [exemplified by Ebola virus (EBOV) and Sudan virus (SUDV)] and Marburg virus (MARV), are defined by the formation of a core, trimeric \u03b1-helical bundle by the ectodomain of the transmembrane subunit during membrane fusion [1, 3] . The post-fusion conformations consist of a \"trimer-of-hairpins\" motif in which the ectodomain N-and C-terminal segments are folded back onto one another; this configuration draws the two membranes into proximity and the energy gained from refolding provides the driving force for membrane fusion. Here, we report the crystal structure of the transmembrane subunit, GP2, from the CAS virus (CASV). CASV was recently isolated from captive boid snakes with inclusion body disease (IBD) and is a putative causative agent [4] . Although CASV is primarily arenavirus like, with a similar genomic organization and a homologous nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase, its envelope glycoprotein is more similar to those of EBOV, SUDV and MARV.",

These are important human pathogens that cause severe hemorrhagic fever associated with high mortality rates [7] . Viral entry has been extensively characterized for EBOV and is mediated by its envelope glycoprotein, GP, which is composed of trimers of GP1-GP2 heterodimers [8] . Entry is initiated by GP1 binding to cell surface receptors that trigger viral uptake into the endocytic pathway [9, 10] . Within endosomes, GP is cleaved by host cysteine proteases, including cathepsin B and cathepsin L, which cleave GP1 to remove all but a\u00f1 17-kDa N-terminal fragment [11] . Interaction of this fragment with the viral receptor Niemann-Pick C1 cholesterol transporter [12] [13] [14] initiates the fusion reaction, whereby GP2 undergoes a large-scale conformational change resulting in the insertion of a hydrophobic fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. This conformation, where GP2 spans the host and viral membranes, is referred to as the \"extended\" or \"pre-hairpin\" intermediate. Next, the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and the C-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) regions of GP2 fold into a thermostable six-helix bundle, or \"trimer-of-hairpins\", promoting membrane fusion by bringing the two membranes into proximity and inducing lipid mixing of the outer leaflets [3, 15] .",

These species can be delineated into two groups based on their antigenic properties and geographic location: the Old World viruses, most notably the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Lassa virus (LASV), and the New World viruses [16, 17] . Multiple Old and New World arenaviruses, including LASV, and a number of the new world viruses cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans associated with significant morbidity and mortality [17] . LCMV is endemic in Mus musculus (the common house mouse) worldwide; although LCMV generally causes a mild viral syndrome in immuno-competent persons, infection has been associated with meningitis, encephalitis and, sometimes, death in immunocompromised patients and with severe birth defects and mental retardation in congenital infection [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

Documented human infection has occurred through exposure to infected animals, either by direct contact of compromised skin with infectious materials or through mucosal exposure to aerosolized viral particles. Recently, however, Stenglein et al. identified CASV and two other novel arenavirus-like agents in boid snakes with IBD [4] . This condition is characterized symptomatically by neurological abnormalities, regurgitation and secondary infections and histologically by cellular eosinophilic inclusions [4, 25] . These novel viruses, CASV, the Golden Gate virus (GGV) and Collierville virus, represent the first arenavirus-like viruses to be identified in a reptilian species and suggest that the species tropism of the Arenaviridae family may be much broader than previously thought. Indeed, additional variants of these arenavirus-like viruses have subsequently been identified in boid snakes with IBD in the Netherlands [26] and in Finland [27] , suggesting that such viruses may be present in snakes worldwide.",

Previous studies have shown that both EBOV and MARV GP2 post-fusion bundles exhibit a marked pH-dependent stability, with higher thermal and chemical stability observed at lower pH [28] [29] [30] . It is hypothesized that this feature of the post-fusion \u03b1-helical bundle is reflective of the endosomal mechanism of entry for these viruses; stabilization of conformations required for membrane fusion (e.g., the post-fusion six-helix bundle) is promoted under conditions of appropriate cellular compartments. Similar pH-dependent stability was observed for CASV GP2. Infectivity experiments using CASV and GGV in the presence of chemical inhibitors of endosomal acidification support the hypothesis that endosomal acidification is required for entry. This work is the first structural characterization of a membrane glycoprotein from this newly identified group of viruses.",

Based on this sequence comparison, we prepared two protein constructs: one consisting of CASV GP2 residues 254-351 [\"CASV-GP2(254-351)\"] and another one consisting of residues 267-351 containing an N-terminal fusion to a trimeric variant of GCN4 coiled coil (\"pII\") [\"pII-CASV-GP2(267-351)\"]. The shortened CASV segment in pIICASV-GP2(267-351) was predicted based on the boundary of the \u03b1-helical NHR segment in EBOV and MARV GP2 [3, 15, 30] . The pII GCN4 coiled coil contains isoleucine side chains at the core heptad repeat positions (a and d of the canonical abcdefg repeat) that designate preferential homotrimer formation [31, 32] . Chimeras of pII and other trimeric coiled coils with fragments of class I fusion protein enhance solubility and have facilitated structural studies in the absence of the transmembrane segment in some cases [15, 30] . In both CASV GP2 constructs, the cysteines at positions 270 and 324 were mutated to serine. The corresponding residues in filovirus GP2 form disulfide bonds within the fusion loop (C270) and to the GP1 subunit (C324), both of which were omitted from the core domain construct. Cysteines 315 and 323 were left as native identity, as the corresponding residues form an intramolecular disulfide bond that stabilizes the loop regions of EBOV and MARV GP2 core domains [3, 15, 30] .",

Heptad repeat stutters result from a disruption in the heptad repeat pattern caused by insertion of an additional defg segment (abcdefg defgabc). The stutters in the EBOV and MARV GP2 NHR segment cause a distortion of the NHR \u03b1-helix at the stutter position and a slight local unwinding of the triple-stranded superhelix. For pIICASV-GP2(267-351), the pII segment was engineered to maintain registry of the heptad repeat pattern with the N-terminal segment of the NHR \u03b1-helix, thereby accounting for effects of the stutter on hydrophobic periodicity (Fig. 1) . Notably, heptad stutters are found in a number of viral glycoproteins from both class I (\u03b1-helical) and class III (mixed \u03b1/\u03b2 structure) categories and have been hypothesized to play a role in viral entry because of this conservation across phylogenetically distant species [33] . However, the precise mechanistic role of the heptad repeat stutter in viral fusion remains unknown. Segments corresponding to \u03b1-helical segments for the previously reported EBOV GP2 and MARV GP2 structures, as well as for the pIICASV-GP2(267-351) structure, are represented as colored cylinders, with the colors of the cylinders matching the structural elements depicted in Fig. 5a for the pIICASV-GP2(267-351) structure. The numbering for the EBOV GP2 residues is shown below the sequences; the numbering for the CASV GP2 residues is shown above the sequences. The a and d positions for the heptad repeat are indicated for the NHR region, with the heptad repeat stutter residue (T565 in EBOV; T279 in CASV) indicated with asterisks.

The overall thermal stability of pIICASV-GP2(267-351) was higher, as expected due to the contribution from the pII segment, but the general pH-dependent trend in thermal stability was still apparent. At pH 4.1, pIICASV-GP2(267-351) could not be fully unfolded even at~100\u00b0C, but at pH 6.3, the melting temperature was~35\u00b0C ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ). Above pH 6.5, both proteins were observed to precipitate out of solution. We have previously observed such pH-dependent behavior for both EBOV and MARV GP2 [28] [29] [30] . The pH-dependent stability of CASV GP2 follows the same pattern as observed with filovirus GP but is significantly more pronounced with CASV GP2 showing marked instability at pH values above pH~5.3 and protein precipitation above pH 6.5. Addition of 500 mM salt (NaCl) resulted in an unusual pattern of thermal denaturation, with a biphasic melting profile (Fig. 4c) ; 500 mM NaCl appears to stabilize the bundle at pH 4.1, 5.3 and 6.0, but pH-dependent stability is still observed.",

We performed two types of experiments to test this hypothesis. First, we quantified virus particle production from infected cells by measuring supernatant viral RNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 5 ). We used CASV and the distantly related GGV that was identified along with CASV in annulated tree boas with IBD to perform these experiments. CASV and GGV share~5 0% overall pairwise amino acid identity [4] . Pretreatment of JK cells (derived from boa constrictor) with monensin, a lysosomotropic ionophore, decreased GGV production by~20-to 40-fold and CASV production by~1000-fold. Pretreatment with bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton pump, had an even more dramatic effect, reducing production of both viruses by approximately 4 logs (Fig. 5a) . We also measured the infectivity of individual GGV particles in a fluorescent-focus assay, which reflects the virus titer and the probability that an individual particle will initiate a productive infection under the experimental conditions (Fig. 5b ). Note that we were unable to perform the fluorescent-focus assay using CASV due to a lack of suitable antibody reagents. Treatment of JK cells with Baf A1 reduced the number of GGV focus-forming units by~65-fold (Fig. 5c ). The results of these experiments suggest that an acidic endosomal environment is necessary for efficient infectivity by CASV and GGV.",

Of note, the anion stripes in the CASV and MARV GP2 bundles are located in similar regions, at about the mid-section of the NHR core trimer (Fig. 8) . Interestingly, the MARV GP2 anion stripe includes a core d residue, MARV E580, whereas the CASV GP2 anion stripe contains a core a residue, CASV E290. Therefore, the core residues of the CASV GP2 anion stripe are located~1 \u03b1-helical turn closer to the N-terminus of the protein (Fig. 8) . As a result, the E580 in MARV GP2 points almost directly into the core NHR trimer, whereas E290 in CASV GP2 is oriented toward the adjacent NHR \u03b1-helical axis. This contrast in side-chain orientation reflects the non-equivalent projection of the C \u03b1 -C \u03b2 bond vector relative to the \u03b1-helical axis for a and d residues in trimeric coiled coils [32] . While this difference in a and d positions has a strong influence on coiled-coil topology for hydrophobic residues [31, 32] , it is interesting to note that, for electrostatic effects, they have similar functional consequences. While the core acidic residues differ between CASV and MARV GP2, the surface residues of the two anion stripes are located at the same level within the coiled coils and are nearly superimposable (Fig. 8) .

By analogy, a stabilizing disulfide bond was predicted to form between CASV C315 and C323; however, no such disulfide bond was observed. Although the side chains of C315 and C323 appear to point toward one another in the crystal structure, the sulfur atoms are separated by 4.96 \u00c5, twice the distance of a disulfide bond (Fig. 6c) . Residue 324, a cysteine in the native GP2 sequence but a serine in our construct, is modeled near C315. It is therefore possible that a disulfide bond forms in the native protein between C324 and C315. However, this is conjecture only, as the electron density throughout the loop region is poorly defined, and the side-chain orientation cannot be definitively assigned. To explore this hypothesis, we generated an additional CASV GP2 construct, pIICASV-GP2(267-351; C323S), that contained the identity of wild-type cysteine side chain at positions 315 and 324 but a cysteine-to-serine mutation at position 323. We hypothesized that, if the native disulfide bond was between C324 and C315, then pIICASV-GP2(267-351; C323S) would display higher thermal stability than pIICASV-GP2(267-351). pIICASV-GP2(267-351; C323S) was expressed and purified, and thermal denaturation was performed as described for pIICASV-GP2(267-351). We observed that the T m values for pII-CASV-GP2(267-351; C323S) were within error of the T m values for pIICASV-GP2(267-351) (Fig. 4d and Table 1 ). These data suggest either that a disulfide bond is not formed in the C323S construct or that a disulfide bond is formed but does not contribute to an increase in stability of this protein construct.",

            "text": "A number of interchain and intrachain salt bridges appear to contribute to the stabilization of the CASV GP2 post-fusion structure (Table 3) . These salt bridges are found in two clusters within the structure: five salt bridges are found stabilizing the NHR-CHR bundle portion of the protein, while two salt bridges are found in the membrane-proximal half of the bundle. Within the first cluster, salt bridges are observed between E344 O\u03b4 and K347 N\u03b5, E343 O\u03b4 and K346 N\u03b5 and D336 O\u03b3 and K340 N\u03b5 within a monomer (Table 3) . Additional salt bridges are seen between neighboring monomers, consisting of residues E344 and K274, as well as between E351 and K271. The electron density for the lysine residues in these interactions is well defined to the N\u03b5 atom, and the majority of the residues involved in these salt bridges are modeled in single conformations. K274 in chain B was modeled in two conformations, one of which is not optimal for salt bridge formation because of the orientation of its N\u03b5 atom away from E344 O\u03b4. However, K274 in Chains A and C are modeled in a single conformation with the N\u03b5 atom directed toward E344 O\u03b4. D336 is also modeled in a double conformation, only one of which is consistent with salt bridge formation. The second cluster of salt bridges consists of D295 and R294 within the same chain and D328 and K288 of neighboring chains. The electron density for these residues is all well defined and modeled in a single conformation. Several possible salt bridges were identified in the EBOV and MARV GP2 structures, although salt bridge formation does not appear to be a major mechanism of stabilization for filovirus GP2 [3, 15, 30] . Interestingly, four stabilizing salt bridges per chain were observed in the LCMV GP2 structure, and mutational studies have shown that these salt bridges seem to play an important role in the stabilization of most arenavirus GP2s [33] .",

Along with GGV, Collierville virus and similar viruses recently identified in the Netherlands, including Boa3 Av NL [26] , and in Finland [27] , these viruses represent the first arenavirus-or filovirus-like agents to be identified outside of a mammalian species, suggesting a previously unrecognized reservoir for potential human and/or mammalian pathogens. Our results are consistent with phylogenetic predictions that CASV GP2 resembles GP2 from EBOV and MARV, with a homologous overall backbone fold and an analogous pattern of pH-dependent thermostability. We confirmed the presence of a heptad repeat stutter in the coiled-coil region of the CASV GP2 sequence, at position T279. Such stutters have been observed in numerous class I and class III viral fusion proteins, notably in viruses that infect host cells through the endocytic pathway [33] . Alignment of CASV, GGV and Boa3 AV NL indicates that CASV T279 is conserved across these three viruses (Fig. 1) .",

This stripe is analogous to the anion stripe observed in MARV GP2; interaction between residues in the stripe may be responsible for the pH-dependent stability of the CASV GP2 post-fusion bundle. These residues are surface exposed and result in significant negative electrostatic surface potential in this portion of the bundle with a solvation energy of \u2212 7175 kcal/mol, indicating that the surface of this protein is highly charged (Fig. 9) . Comparison of the solvation energy of CASV GP2 to EBOV GP2 (\u2212 3178 kcal/mol), MARV GP2 (\u2212 4163 kcal/mol) and LCMV GP2 (\u2212 6162 kcal/mol) suggests that CASV GP2 contains the highest surface charge of these four proteins (Fig. 9) . Several studies have demonstrated the importance of electrostatics in stabilizing with the residues involved in the anion stripes in both proteins represented in spacefill. Inset shows blow-up of anionic stripes, shown in sticks. The residues in the stripe that are located on the surface of the bundles overlay quite well (top inset). However, the internally facing residues differ by one \u03b1-helical turn (lower inset). viral glycoprotein post-fusion bundles, particularly for those that are stabilized by low pH [28, 29, 35, [37] [38] [39] [40] . The anion stripe found in CASV GP2 has significantly more anionic character than the analogous MARV GP2 anion stripe. This analysis provides a potential rationale for the pH-dependent stabilization of CASV GP2, which is stabilized at lower pH than either MARV GP2 or EBOV GP2 [28, 29] . We observed that 500 mM salt significantly stabilized the bundle from pH 4.1 to pH 6.0 (Fig. 4c) , presumably by shielding the charges on the surface of CASV GP2, supporting the hypothesis that the anion stripe is at least partially responsible for the destabilization of the bundle at higher pH.",

            "text": "As an interesting comparison, the post-fusion structure of the transmembrane subunit from the avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV) envelope glycoprotein (TM) was recently reported and shares high structural similarity to EBOV and MARV GP2 (backbone RMSD values of 1.6 and 1.5 \u00c5, respectively) [41] . ASLV enters cells using an unusual two-step mechanism that has both pH-independent and pH-dependent features. Receptor binding and exposure of the fusion loop occur at neutral pH; however, viral reverse transcripts are not detected in cells treated with bafilomycin, suggesting that endosomal pH is required for infection [42] . Aydin et al. found that the ASLV TM bundle was equally stable at low and neutral pH, with only small differences in T m , over a range of pH 5.0-8.5 [41] . This behavior contrasts with the marked pH-dependent stability of the EBOV, MARV and CASV GP2 post-fusion \u03b1-helical bundles. Mutational studies on ASLV TM suggest that two histidine residues (H490 and H492) in the chain reversal region confer stability at low pH either by direct electrostatic interaction with a neighboring acidic residue (H492 and D496) or by overall stabilization of a putative helical dipole at the membrane-distal end of the core NHR trimer. No AniAni interactions were identified in ASLV TM, consistent with the finding that the post-fusion conformation is not sensitive to pH [41] .",

            "text": "To compare the overall backbone folds of CASV GP2 to other viral glycoprotein fusion subunits, we examined the global backbone RMSD values of the ectodomain segments using the SuperPose server [43] . The pII (GCN4) segments for pII-GP fusions were omitted from the RMSD calculation. The overall backbone conformation of the CASV GP2 trimer is extremely similar to the backbone from both MARV and EBOV GP2 (RMSD values of 0.69 \u00c5 with MARV and 0.75 \u00c5 with EBOV) (PDB ID 2EBO) (Fig. 10 ). This striking similarity is somewhat surprising, given that the sequences share b 26% identity ( Table 4 ). The backbone conformation of CASV GP2 also displays marked similarity to the fusion protein from MoMLV, a retrovirus that causes cancer in some murine hosts. The structure that is available for the MoMLV fusion protein (TM) is truncated before the CHR \u03b1-helical segments [34] ; however, the trimeric NHR coiled-coil core of MoMLV aligns well with the CASV GP2 helical core (RMSD = 0.50 \u00c5) with particular similarity observed in the membrane-proximal half of the bundle, including the loop region (Fig. 10) . The CASV, MARV and EBOV GP2 structures all contained the pII (GCN4) trimerization motif. Although this segment was not included in the alignment, it should nonetheless be considered whether it is in part responsible for the similarity among these three GP2s. None of the pII fusion structures contain long-range interactions between GP2 segments and pII. Furthermore, two structures of EBOV GP2 exist, one containing the pII fusion and one without, and the EBOV GP2 segments are in strong agreement with one another and both the MARV and CASV segments [3, 15, 30] . Therefore, these structures likely represent the native GP2 post-fusion conformations. Interestingly, however, global alignment of the CASV and LCMV GP2 post-fusion structures results in a high RMSD (4.20 \u00c5; Fig. 10 ). The packing of the CHR segments relative to the NHR core trimers differs dramatically, and the loop region connecting the NHR and CHR segments is significantly different. Nonetheless, despite the low sequence homology (13%; Table 4 ) and poor global structural alignment, the architecture of CASV GP2 does share some similar features with LCMV GP2. Both structures contain a long core NHR trimer including a heptad repeat stutter at similar locations ( trimer-of-hairpins motif containing shorter CHR segments and the presence of many potential salt bridges. Additionally, the CASV GP2 and EBOV/MARV GP2 bundles display features that are remarkably similar to those in the fusion proteins of other unrelated viruses, such as the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 GP21 and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus S2 [44, 45] . The conservation of the general architecture of the fusion proteins across these various viral families suggests that the structure plays a crucial role in viral entry. It has been previously hypothesized that arenavirus and filovirus glycoproteins arose from a common RNA virus ancestor because of similarities in the overall structure and amino-terminal residues [46] . The evolutionary origin of the CASV family of viruses remains unknown, but the similarity of CASV GP2 with EBOV and MARV GP2 raises the interesting possibility that these viruses, or at least these glycoprotein genes, do indeed share a common ancestor. It is striking that the mechanism for pH dependence is similar for both CASV and MARV GP2, involving an anion stripe, but that the locations of participating residues are not identical. Thus, the specific interactions giving rise to pH-dependent behavior in these two cases may have resulted from independent co-evolution or may be the result of a single, common ancestor. Either way, the results presented here demonstrate that the GP2 structural architecture and pH-dependent stability of the post-fusion state are critical to function across multiple viruses.",

Dilutions were prepared in serum-free modified Eagle's medium with 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), from a culture supernatant stock that had been clarified by centrifugation at 10,000g for 1 min. After 3 h of incubation at 30\u00b0C, culture medium was replaced with complete media supplemented with molten 0.75% low-melting point agarose (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). After 7 days of incubation, overlays were removed and cells fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Wells were washed 3 times for 5 min in PBS, then in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS twice, then in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween-20).

Cells were washed 4 times in PBST, then incubated in goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer, then washed again as before. A final wash in PBS was performed before imaging wells on a LI-COR Odyssey scanner.",
