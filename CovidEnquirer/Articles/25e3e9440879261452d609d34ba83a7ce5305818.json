Advances in DNA synthesis and assembly over the past years has resulted in a steep drop in price for custom made DNA. Similar effects were observed in DNA sequencing technologies which underpin DNA-reading projects. Today, synthetic DNA sequences with more than 10 000 bps and turn-around times of a few weeks are commercially available. This enables researchers to perform large-scale projects to write synthetic chromosomes and characterize their functionalities in vivo. Synthetic genomics opens up new paradigms to study the genome fundamentals and engineer novel biological functions.",

However, the Human Genome Project (GP-Read) accelerated the evolution of new sequencing techniques by having the ambitious goal to sequence the human genome within 15 years. The development of Next Generation Sequencing techniques today allows sequencing of a human genome within days. However, most eukaryotic genomes are not fully sequenced and new sequencing techniques are still being developed. As exemplary achievement of this development, in 2017 sequencing of one of the highly repetitive human centromeres was achieved [2 ] . Scientists are now performing well in reading genomes, a measurable output being the growing number of genome sequences in public databases. However, reading a book alone does not make a good writer, instead it requires one to start writing extensively and creatively to master the art and ultimately it leads to a better understanding of grammar and expression. In this case, one needs to write synthetic DNA sequences in order to better understand the grammar of life.",

Since the development of the Polymerase Chain Reaction and the first complete synthesis of a gene, writing DNA in vitro has progressed impressively ( Figure 1 ) [3, 4] . Recent drops in DNA synthesis costs and the improved capability of synthesizing longer stretches of DNA allow the design and construction of whole synthetic chromosomes in the mega-base range. Recent publications report the construction of viral and microbial synthetic genomes, and the Sc2.0 project aims to generate the first synthetic eukaryotic genome. It is an open discussion how to define whether a chromosome or genome is synthetic. In this review, chromosomes and genomes are defined as synthetic when all building blocks of the final DNA molecule are generated by chemical synthesis. Chromosomes and genomes which are not completely synthesized are considered 'engineered' or 'modified' and are outside the scope of this review. We define synthetic genomics to be a new field where biology is being engineered at the genome level, and it is an intersection of synthetic biology and systems biology. This review neither aims to discuss assembly methods nor the dualuse character of synthetic genomics. The authors are fully aware of the potential dual use character, especially for the synthesis of viral genomes. However, these issues are discussed and reviewed extensively elsewhere [5] [6] [7] .",

Many genome synthesis projects utilize a hierarchical genome assembly strategy starting with small building blocks which are assembled, by the technique of choice, to larger building blocks of around 50-100 kb. These fragments are used to further assemble the synthetic chromosome in a heterologous host or to replace the corresponding wildtype sequence in a stepwise manner.

Viral genomes are rather small, with sizes between 1759 bps (Porcine circovirus [14] ) and 1259 kb (Megavirus chilensis [15] ) and can consist of DNA or RNA. The first complete synthesis of a viral RNA genome, the polio virus, was accomplished in 2002 [16 ] . The 7.5 kb synthesized cDNA genome was in vitro transcribed by RNA polymerase and can generate infectious virus particles after transfer into a cell free extract. Further viral RNA and DNA genomes were synthesized up to a size of 212 kb in recent years (Table 1) . Synthesizing, as well as engineering variations of viral genomes to produce genome libraries, has an enormous potential for therapeutic applications. Vaccines and drugs could be quickly generated in The number of genome sequences uploaded to databases is exploding and it is impossible to give a number which would be accurate and valid for some time. The knowledge gained by genome sequencing and advantages in gene synthesis is the dawn of writing chromosomes. By now the number of bases incorporated into completely synthetic chromosomes is: 6.1 mb. The cost by today would be roughly $425 000 assuming the current competitive price rate of 7 cents per base for nonclonal 1.8 kb DNA-fragments. The synthesis cost for a haploid human genome would by today be roughly $45 000 000. However, lowering DNA synthesis costs is one of the major goals of GP-write. In the future, the DNA synthesis cost of a human genome in will be less than the price of the Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0 project (estimated $40 000 000 [33] ).",
