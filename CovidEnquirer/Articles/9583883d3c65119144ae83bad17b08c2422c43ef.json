Gross and histological assessment of reproductive tissues is a valuable tool if used appropriately. Assessment of a problem often requires collaboration of the cytogeneticist, endocrinologist, theriogenologist and pathologist, who, alone, may not be able to determine the complete pathogenesis. For the pathologist to function optimally, appropriate samples must be collected and processed. For many of the diseases and the tissues, routine fixation with 10% formalin is adequate, but for a detailed assessment of spermatogenesis, or the histological appearance of seminiferous tubules, rapid fixation after death or collection (within minutes in many species) in Bouin's fluid or Zenker's fluid, with paraffin embedding, is necessary. Plastic embedding is the method of choice for a detailed assessment of the spermatogenic cycle. Inadequate fixation or suboptimal processing of testicular tissues will cause artifacts that cannot be distinguished from degeneration.",

Even experienced pathologists have difficult), in differentiating hypoplastic from atrophic testes in adults. This is because there are variations in the degree of hypoplasia and, over time, hypoplastic testes may undergo degeneration.The dogma is that in atrophic testes, the ratio of testicular to epididymal weight is reduced since the reduction in size of the testis is greater than the reduction in size of the epididymis. The basement membrane of appropriately fixed atrophic testes is buckled or has a \"wavy\" outline. In hypoplastic testes, the ratio of the weight of the testis to epididymis is similar to that of normal testes. The size of both is smaller that normal and there are histological features of spermatogenic arrest in tubules that are smaller than age-and breed-matched controls. The best method to be sure that degeneration has occurred is to demonstrate a decrease from normal testicular weight or size over time. In contrast, hypoplastic testes are smaller than normal and remain so. Since pathologists usually must make an assessment based on a single observation, a diagnosis of\"small testes\" is not necessarily an indication of ignorance; rather, it is an indication of appropriate caution.",

Early epithelial changes include hyperplasia and hydropic degeneration, with the formation of intraepithelial lumina (Fig. 5.33 ).At the same time there is increasing fibrosis in interstitial areas. The combination of fibrosis and epithelial hyperplasia obstructs the lumen and causes spermiostasis. These changes develop over many months, and large numbers of organisms are excreted in the ejaculate. Subsequent events depend on the extravasation of spermatozoa and formation of sperm granulomas. The tail of the epididymis in these cases may be enlarged 4-5 times (Fig. 5.34) , and the lesion is often bilateral. If the extravasated spermatozoa enter the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, adhesions will result and testicular degeneration increases. Unlike brucellosis in the bull, there is no primary orchitis. Lesions in the deferent duct similar to those in the epididymis may occur, but are not associated with sperm stasis or leakage. There is pronounced epithelial hyperplasia, with thickening and folding of the wall, and the lamina propria is densely infiltrated with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.

Sudden enlargement of the testis, and pain caused by hemorrhage and necrosis in the tumor, are often the presenting signs in dogs. In all species, the sectional surface is coarsely lobulated by a few fine trabeculae, the color is usually white or gray-white, and the texture is soft to moderately firm (Fig. 5.44 ). If lightly squeezed, a milky fluid may exude from the cut surface. The texture and color closely resemble that of neoplastic lymphoid tissue. Microscopically, intratubular, and diffuse types are recognized. The earliest development of the tumor is intratubular and even in some large specimens intratubular growth is still evident and undoubtedly comprises one method of spread (Fig. 5.45A ). Rupture of the tubules soon occurs and the growth becomes confluent, forming broad sheets of closely packed cells with scant supporting stroma.There is only slight cytological variation from tumor to tumor. The cells are large and polyhedral and fairly discrete, with a rim of visible cytoplasm that may be basophilic or eosinophilic (Fig. 5.45B ). The nuclei are large and rounded and usually strongly chromatic with one or more large acidophilic nucleoli. In some tumors, the nuclei are larger and vesicular but still regular in shape, and the cells are closely packed with scant or invisible cytoplasm. In many seminomas, it is possible to find scattered mono-or multinucleate giant cells with abundant granular acidophilic cytoplasm. Focal or diffuse accumulations of CD8& lymphocytes occur in most seminomas and are a useful distinguishing feature. Whereas atrophy of tubules at the edge of the tumor is normally evident, occasional foci of marked intratubular spermatogonial proliferation and early seminoma formation in this location are sometimes seen. Germ cells stain by immunohistochemistry with vimentin in a perinuclear pattern, but they are negative for neuron-specific enolase and cytokeratin.",

The pathogenesis of varices in animals is not well understood. In humans, the left unilateral location is regarded as the result of altered hemodynamics from insertion of the testicular vein to the renal vein rather than directly to the vena cava.
