Here, we evaluated whether the 3D8scFv gene affects the colonization of E coli when E. coli 3D8scFv passes through the mouse gastrointestinal tract. To determine the colonization ability of E. coli 3D8scFv, E. coli cells with or without the 3D8scFv gene were fed to mice. Total DNA was extracted from the animals' stools, stomach, small intestine and colon. All samples were amplified using 3D8scFv gene-specific primer sets. E. coli 3D8scFv begins to be excreted 1 h after feeding and that all E. coli 3D8scFv cells were excreted between 12 and 24 h after the last feeding of the cells. The previously measured gastrointestinal transit time of the mice was between 8 h and 22 h. The results of this study therefore show that E. coli 3D8scFv cannot colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of mice. In addition, if the purified 3D8 scFv protein is used as a feed additive, any associated E. coli 3D8scFv bacteria will not colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of the livestock. Thus, this feed additive meets the safety assessment criteria for the commercial use of bacteria.",

Recently, avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses from East Asia have spread to the Americas and Europe, and human infection with avian influenza A virus has been reported in China (Artois et al., 2017) . In addition, Ebola virus and beta coronavirus, which cause Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), respectively, are known to be fatal to humans. These viruses have spread to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia and have raised the fear of new viruses (Mackay and Arden, 2015; Martinez et al., 2015) . Notably, some viruses isolated from animals have been reported to induce fatal diseases in humans due to the mutation and evolution of the animal viruses (Parrish et al., 2008) . Avian influenza A viruses from birds, Ebola viruses from bats and rodents, and beta coronaviruses from bats and camels have been transmitted to humans (Parrish et al., 2008) . All of these viruses are single-stranded RNA viruses. Therefore, the prevention of virus infections in livestock is essential for eliminating the potential risk to human life caused by cross-species viral transmission between humans and livestock.",

The VH and VL of the mAb 3D8 IgG are connected by a flexible linker, (G 4 S) 3 , to create 3D8 scFv (Kim et al., 2006) . This recombinant single-chain variable fragment can penetrate cells via caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Once endocytosed, 3D8 scFv remains in the cytoplasm without further trafficking into endosomes, lysosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi, or the nucleus. In the nucleus, 3D8 scFV induces the hydrolysis of both DNA and RNA (Jang et al., 2009) . 3D8 scFv has also been reported to exert an antiviral effect against classical swine fever virus (CSFV), which is an RNA virus that primarily infects pigs (Jun et al., 2010) . A strain of Escherichia coli harboring nucleic acid-hydrolyzing codon-optimized 3D8 scFv (E. coli 3D8scFv) was developed for use as a feed additive to prevent norovirus infection, and Lactobacillus paracasei harboring nucleic acid-hydrolyzing 3D8 scFv was developed for use as a preventive probiotic. The use of these strains was shown to prevent the induction of apoptosis during murine norovirus (MNV) infection and to decrease mRNA expression for the viral capsid protein VP1 (Hoang et al., 2015) .",

For assessing the risk of genetically modified organisms, the concept of substantial equivalence has been adopted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and is used globally. According to this concept, E. coli 3D8scFv should not have any effect, except an anti-viral effect, on the animals to which it is administered.

However, the possibility that E. coli 3D8scFv exhibits an altered growth rate should be considered when measuring this survival rate. Therefore, before injecting E. coli 3D8scFv into mice, we analyzed the growth rate and the number of CFUs in E. coli 3D8scFv cultures grown in liquid medium. E. coli pET42, which contains the same genes as E. coli 3D8scFv except for the 3D8scFv gene, was used as a control. M9 minimal medium was used to minimize the effects of the presence of varying levels of nutrients in the growth medium. Aliquots of fresh medium were inoculated with E. coli 3D8scFv or with the control strain, and the OD 600 and the number of CFUs in the inoculated cultures were measured. Aliquots of the cell cultures were collected at the same time intervals (0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h,  12 h, 1 d, 3 d, 6 d, 15 d, 18 d, and 21 d) used for the collection of stools in mice, and the OD 600 and CFU of the cell culture aliquots were measured (Choi et al., 2017) . The OD 600 values of the E. coli 3D8scFv culture samples were measured and normalized to the blank value (Fig. 1A) . To identify statistically significant differences between E. coli 3D8scFv and the control, p values were determined by using a twotailed t-test versus the control for each time point (Park et al., 2017) . The growth of both E. coli 3D8scFv and the control strain reached stationary phase after 1-3 h of lag phase growth and 9 h of exponential phase growth. The growth of E. coli 3D8scFv appeared to be slower than that of the control at 12 h, and that difference was statistically significant. However, the observed effect may be due to a difference in the number of cells in the inoculum. The OD 600 values of E. coli 3D8scFv and the control were 0.0057 and 0.0127, respectively. To measure the viability of the E. coli 3D8scFv and control strains, we measured the CFUs present in the cultures (Fig. 1B) . Both strains showed the highest CFU counts after a 12 h incubation; at 21 d, the number of CFUs had decreased but remained significant. This finding indicates that E. coli 3D8scFv can colonize the gastrointestinal tracts of mice if the appropriate conditions are present. For both strains, the CFU values and the OD 600 values of the cultures exhibited statistically significant differences at 12 h; interestingly, the CFU value at 6 d also showed a statistically significant difference, indicating that the presence of the 3D8scFv gene temporarily affects the viability of the cells.",

The blots were probed with an anti-His tag antibody, and the expression of the 3D8 scFv protein was compared with the level of expression of the protein product of the E. coli housekeeping gene ompF. In a previous report, the plasma half-life of the scFv protein was shown to be 0.6 h (Hutt et al., 2012) , and the stability of the protein was shown to depend on the amino acid sequence and the length of the linker between the VH and the VL of mAb 3D8 IgG. The results obtained in our study showed that the 3D8 scFv protein is stable for 12 h, after which it is rapidly degraded. Therefore, the 3D8 scFv protein can exist in mice for more than 12 h, even after all E. coli 3D8scFv has been excreted.",

E. coli cells containing or lacking the 3D8scFv gene (2\u217910 9 cells/sample) or saline were fed to mice (10 mice were fed E. coli 3D8scFv, 5 mice were fed host E. coli, and 5 mice were given saline) three times at 24-h intervals. The body weights of the mice were measured and stools were collected 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, 1 d, 3 d, 7 d, 15 d, 18 d, and 21 d after the last feeding of cells or saline (Fig. 3A) . Until 24 h after the last feeding, the body weights of mice that were fed E. coli containing the 3D8tscFv gene were higher than those of the mice that were fed E. coli lacking the 3D8scFv gene, but no significant differences in body weight were observed after 24 h (Fig. 3B ). In addition, at the end of the observation period, no remarkable mortality or individual clinical signs were noted in any of the animals (Supplementary Data 1). To detect E. coli containing the 3D8scFv gene in the cultured cells and in the stools of the treated animals, we designed a set of 3D8scFv gene-specific primers. When tested in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), this primer set did not result in any nonspecific gene amplification. The predicted size of the fragment amplified by this primer set is 523 bp. E. coli 3D8scFv and host E. coli cells were used in PCR as positive and negative control templates, respectively. We used two different methods to prepare the PCR templates. In one method, total DNA was extracted directly from the stools of the treated animals; in the other method, total DNA was extracted from cells that had been obtained from stool suspensions and cultured on plates. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect amplified bands from total DNA extracted directly from the stools at any of the time intervals tested (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). This lack of detection may have been caused by the recovery of an amount of DNA that was smaller than the minimum amount required to serve as a template in PCR amplification. We were also unable to obtain PCR-amplified bands when SD rats were used instead of mice (data not shown). To increase the efficiency of gene detection, we dissolved stools from the treated animals in saline and cultured the supernatants of these suspensions on bacterial culture plates containing kanamycin. On the kanamycin-containing plates used to culture cells obtained from mice that were fed host E. coli or saline, few colonies were formed, whereas hundreds of colonies appeared on the kanamycin-containing plates used to culture cells obtained from mice that were fed E. coli 3D8scFv. We picked all colonies from the plates, dissolved them in water, and used them as templates for PCR. E. coli 3D8scFv was detected at the 3 h, 6 h, 9 h and 12 h time intervals in nearly all of the cultures obtained from mice that were fed E. coli 3D8scFv (Fig. 4 , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2) , whereas no E. coli 3D8scFv was detected in cultures obtained from the stools of mice that had orally ingested either host E. coli or saline. The gastrointestinal transit time in mice has been reported to be between 8 h and 22 h (Padmanabhan et al., 2013) . These results show that E. coli 3D8scFv was excreted within the normal digestion time by mice that were fed E. coli 3D8scFv; thus, E. coli 3D8scFv did not colonize the animals' gastrointestinal tracts.",

In this study, we investigated whether an E. coli K-12 strain secreting a recombinant nucleic acid antibody that is known to inhibit the multiplication of MNV is capable of colonizing the intestines of mice. E. coli is a bacterium that is present in the lower intestines of humans and animals. The detection of E. coli in food is one of the characteristic measures used to detect food contamination, and the presence of E. coli in food generally indicates that the food was exposed to the excreta of humans or animals. However, one E. coli strain, E. coli Nissle 1917, has been used as a probiotic. This probiotic was used as a carrier to deliver oral vaccines that protect the intestine from infection by mucosal and hematogenic pathogens (Buddenborg et al., 2008) . Many microbial pathogens are known to be transmitted through the mucosal surfaces of the gastrointestinal tracts of the host.",

            "text": "The E. coli K-12 strain is known to have a low colonization efficiency in the human gut in comparison to the E. coli Nissle 1917 strain, and this difference is expected because the E. coli K-12 genome lacks the virulence factors that are present in E. coli Nissle 1917 (Grozdanov et al., 2004) . Interestingly, although colonization by E. coli K-12 does not occur in the human intestine, colonization of the human intestine by genetically modified E. coli K-12 has been reported to occur when the intestinal microbiota become unbalanced due to antibiotic treatment or inflammation (Heimesaat et al., 2013) . Therefore, we evaluated the possible use of E. coli 3D8 scFv as a probiotic to inhibit MNV infection via the colonization of the intestine and the destruction of the intestinal microbiota in mice. In addition, to test whether E. coli 3D8scFv complies with the substantial equivalence concept required for safety assessment, we determined whether ingested E. coli 3D8scFv are excreted rapidly without colonizing the intestine when the purified 3D8 scFv protein is used as a feed additive. The results of this study showed that orally ingested E. coli 3D8scFv is excreted from mice and that the excretion of the bacteria occurs within the normal digestive transit time of the animals without colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by E. coli 3D8scFv. These results suggest that while E. coli 3D8scFv cannot be used as a probiotic, E. coli 3D8scFv can be used as a source of purified 3D8 scFv for use as a feed additive. The purified 3D8 scFv is therefore suitable as a feed additive according to the concept of substantial equivalence.",

With respect to the use of 3D8 scFv in the vaccination of animals, it is necessary to consider whether humans can be infected with residual norovirus present in immunized livestock that do not show symptoms of norovirus infection.",
