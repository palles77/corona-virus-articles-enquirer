On the first farm, all nine diarrheic calves sampled once in June had Giardia cysts in their feces. On the second farm, all five diarrheic calves examined at the beginning of the diarrhea outbreak in March had Giardia infection. When resampled, the overall infection rate of normal and diarrheic calves was 82.4% in April, and 40.0% in August after the diarrhea subsided. Positive calves ranged from 11 to 164 days of age, and 22.2% of them were as young as 1 to 3 weeks of age. Eight of nine diarrheic calves (88.8%) on the first farm had Cryptosporidium infection. Lower infection rates (< 30%) were found on the second farm. Six of 10 positive calves were 11-22 days old, three were 164-177 days old, and one was 71 days old. Five of these 10 positive calves were also positive for Giardia infection.",

The farm had about 60 male Holstein calves 2-6 weeks old at the time of the outbreak. They were purchased from dairy farms in New York and Florida shortly after their birth. These calves were then raised together in large pens and later sold to children participating in farm animal fairs or 4-H programs. At sampling, about 30% of calves were affected.

Holstein and Jersey calves on this farm were separated from their mothers shortly after birth and kept in individual calf hutches over gravel until weaning at eight weeks of age. After weaning, they were moved to large outdoor stalls with shelter. Diarrhea began in March 1992, in hutch calves. Four of seven calves in hutches had chronic diarrhea, which recovered spontaneously after about 1 month. Affected animals also showed ill-thrift, lethargy, dehydration and weight loss. Problems continued in animals born later. At the end of April, there were nine calves in hutches, four of them still having diarrhea. Diarrhea gradually disappeared in summer.",

It should, however, be noted that metronidazole has both anti-bacterial and anti-protozoal activity (Adam, 1991 ) , although animals with diarrhea had previously failed to respond to antibiotic therapy. The role of Cryptosporidium in the two outbreaks appeared to be less important because of its lower infection rates and intensities.
