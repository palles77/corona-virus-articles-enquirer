We sought to determine the effect of this infection on the shape and number of dendritic cells and other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expressing cells in the airway mucosa of Wistar rats. Changes in the shape of subepithelial OX6 (anti-MHC class II)-immunoreactive cells were evident in the tracheal mucosa 2 days after intranasal inoculation with M. pulmonis. By 1 week, the shape of the cells had changed from stellate to rounded (mean shape index increased from 0.42 to 0.77). The number of OX6-positive cells was increased 6-fold at 1 week and 16-fold at 4 weeks. Coincident with these changes, many columnar epithelial cells developed OX6 immunoreactivity, which was still present at 4 weeks. We conclude that M. pulmonis infection creates a potent immunologic stimulus that augments and transforms the OX6-immunoreactive cell population in the airways by changing the functional state of airway dendritic cells, initiating an influx of MHC class II expressing cells, and activating expression of MHC class II molecules by airway epithelial cells. \u00d3 2003 Published by Elsevier Science (USA).",

Dendritic cells (DC) are the principal MHC class II expressing cells in the normal airway mucosa. These cells play a major role in the processing of inhaled antigens and may participate in the pathogenesis of infectious and allergic airway diseases [2] [3] [4] . During steady-state conditions, DC turnover every 36-48 h [5] . However, the DC network rapidly expands after exposure to a variety of pathogens and antigens [6] . For example, exposure to aerosolized heat-inactivated Moraxella catarrhalis causes DC influx into the airways which peaks within 3 h and remains elevated for 48 h [5] . Inoculation of viable Bordatella pertussis results in DC recruitment with similar kinetics but with a maximal cell density at 24 h [7] . Even at the peak of the inflammatory response, DC are the principal MHC class II expressing cells-greatly outnumbering macrophages and B lymphocytes [7] . Such stimuli can also evoke transient expression of MHC class II molecules by airway epithelial cells [8] [9] [10] .",

            "text": "Less is known about the involvement of DC and other MHC class II expressing cells in chronic inflammatory airway disease, in part because most disease models have focused on transient conditions. The longlasting consequences of Mycoplasma pulmonis infection make it useful for studying changes in chronic disease Cellular Immunology 220 (2002) 107-115 www.elsevier.com/locate/ycimm [11] [12] [13] . The organisms attach to the luminal surface of the airway epithelium of rats and mice [12] and are not cleared from the airways despite strong cellular and humoral immune responses [11, [13] [14] [15] . The ongoing stimulus causes an influx of mononuclear cells, including DC, macrophages, and lymphocytes [15] [16] [17] [18] . The development of mucosal lymphoid tissue is a prominent part of the remodeling of the airway mucosa, and is accompanied by epithelial cell and mucous gland hyperplasia, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and increased sensitivity of the newly formed blood vessels to the neuropeptide substance P [13, 14, 19, 20] . Although some of these changes may occur after viral infection [20, 21] , M. pulmonis infection is unusual in that it causes life-long disease and, if untreated, can result in severe remodeling of the airway mucosa [22] . The role of DC and other MHC class II expressing cells in these changes is unknown [16, 17] , but is of interest because of the rapid cellular response after infection and the strong immunological component of mycoplasmal airway disease.",

By comparison, cross-sections, which did not have the limitation of reagent penetration, clearly revealed the thickening of the mucosa and showed abundant OX6positive cells throughout the mucosa.

The phenotypic distinction between DC and other cell types blurs after mycoplasmal infection, when multiple cell types express MHC class II molecules [30, 31] . The characteristic branched morphology of DC in pathogen-free rats was no longer present in the OX6-positive cell population 1 week after infection and could, therefore, not be used to distinguish DC from other MHC class II expressing cells. Accordingly, some OX6-positive cells observed after infection may represent activated macrophages or B lymphocytes that have infiltrated the airway mucosa [15, 31] . The exact proportion of DC relative to other MHC class II expressing cells cannot be definitively determined without using multiple cell markers. For example, activated B-cells could be identified by using OX12 as a marker [8] . However, it is unlikely that activated macrophages make a major contribution to the OX6-positive cell population, because in infected ani-mals they acquire a distinctive distribution around angiogenic blood vessels, quite different from the pattern of OX6 immunoreactivity [18] .",

Rounded DC precursors are not seen in control animals, and their transformation from rounded to stellate phenotype is most likely explained by local factors affecting DC maturation [5] . In our experiments, OX6-positive cells with a rounded phenotype accumulated in the airways during the first week after M. pulmonis infection. Perhaps the transformation from stellate to rounded phenotype reflects changes in DC maturation, differentiation, or motility. Alternatively, the apparent change in DC phenotype may represent the gradual replacement of stellate DC by rounded MHC class II expressing cells such as B-cells.",

Additionally, OX6 immunoreactivity has been reported in other types of epithelial cells after exposure to endotoxin or IFN-c [9, 10, 34] . It is not clear whether the M. pulmonis organisms themselves or perhaps their ability to stimulate IFN-c production is driving the MHC class II expression by epithelial cells.

MHC class II-expressing cells become much more abundant in the mucosa during the first four weeks after infection, and concurrently, columnar epithelial cells begin to express MHC class II molecules. The rounding of OX6-positive cells after infection suggests that existing DC change shape during maturation or differentiation or are replaced by OX6-positive cells with a rounded phenotype. Changes in the OX6-positive cell population probably reflect the activation of an adaptive immune response and may play a role in the progression to chronic disease by persistently stimulating T lymphocyte responses.",
