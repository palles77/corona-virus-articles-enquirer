A BBC television program quoted by Page and Meyer (1996) examined some risks met by British holidaymakers in the Mediterranean. These risks were often due to building construction and maintenance faults like improperly serviced gas fl ues in self-catering accommodation units, unsatisfactory fi re safety provision and swimming pool defi ciencies. Any resulting crisis could therefore also be defi ned as technological in another example of crisis convergence. Engaging in new pastimes may be risky and even familiar pursuits like driving can be dangerous, with statistics dominated by motor accidents. Traffi c accidents involving hired vehicles are routine occurrences and may not always be the fault of the driver. Resulting injuries and fatalities refl ect badly on any commercial operators implicated and, should they recur, on the location which could be tainted by perceptions that it is unsafe and regulations are lax.",

American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta, Northwest, Japan Airlines, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, British Airways, KLM and Virgin Air were among a total of 27 carriers named in a 2001 lawsuit. A London court concluded that blood clots were a \"serious personal injury\" and could not be defi ned as an \"accident\" under the Warsaw Convention; the 1929 treaty recognizes that airline liability regarding damages applies only to the latter. The Supreme Court in the Australian state of Victoria, however, decided in favor of the plaintiffs in a parallel case, permitting a landmark lawsuit to proceed. American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement in a blood clot dispute at the end of 2002. Analysts were watching for any court judgment in the United States where the award of damages would probably be very high and perhaps set a precedent.",

However, it also stated its belief that any link with air travel was uncertain and this would inform its position on other claims. It had, nevertheless, introduced a new Manual of Infl ight Medical Care in late 2001 to assist crew in looking after passengers who became ill during fl ights. The manual provided instructions on dealing with many scenarios and was complemented by staff training and a CD-ROM version, the company's intranet used for additional training purposes. These materials are supplemented by a telephone link to a 24-hour advice center on the ground. Other measures to minimize the risks of DVT had been in operation for some time. Sources of information and advice included the corporate website, phone lines, in-fl ight videos and magazines and ticket wallets. A Healthy Journey leafl et recommended that passengers drink plenty of fl uids, eat moderately and limit their intake of alcohol and caffeine. They were also advised not to remain seated for the whole of a long-haul fl ight and appropriate exercises were suggested.",
