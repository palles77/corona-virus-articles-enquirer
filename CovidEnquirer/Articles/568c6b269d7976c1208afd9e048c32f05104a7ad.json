Although current data are limited for the veterinary field, similar (or even higher) HAI rates have been reported compared with human studies, such as HAIs in 16% of intensive care unit patients in one study. 3 During a 5-year period, 82% of veterinary teaching hospitals in North America and Europe reported at least one HAI outbreak and 45% reported multiple outbreaks. Many of these outbreaks required restricted patient admissions (58%) or closure of the hospital or section (32%). 4 Therefore, although HAIs are poorly quantified in veterinary medicine, they are undeniably a concern.",

Animals suffering from HAIs may have an increased hospital stay (with accompanying increased cost to the client or clinic). These patients may also suffer permanent health consequences, or HAIs may result in death of the pet. Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are often involved in HAIs, complicating treatment and resulting in poor patient outcomes and extensive outbreaks. Furthermore, some veterinary hospital-associated (HA) pathogens (eg, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] , Salmonella) can be transmitted to staff or pet owners, resulting in human illness. Additionally, as veterinary medicine advances, there may be parallel increases in HAI risk through the use of more invasive procedures, more use of invasive devices (eg, urinary catheters, intravenous catheters), more immunosuppressant therapies, and a greater intensity of critical care management. Patients that might not have survived their underlying disease in the past may now be alive, but highly susceptible to infection.",

Studies have reported catheter-associated bacteriuria occurring in 10% to 32% of hospitalized dogs, with a subset of these exhibiting clinical signs or other evidence of infection. [7] [8] [9] [10] The interference of normal defense mechanisms by urinary catheters, such as mucosalsecreted adhesion inhibitors, along with patient comorbid factors and some catheter handling factors, facilitate bacterial colonization of the catheter and ascension of the organism or organisms into the bladder. These pathogens may be endogenous to the patient, arising from the rectum or perineum, or directly from the hospital environment or people through contamination of the drainage system or bag. If the collection system has been contaminated, bacteria can ascend into the bladder through the catheter if there is retrograde flow of urine. Retrograde urine flow can occur if the collection system is elevated above the level of the patient; if collection lines are flushed, or if there is obstruction to flow in the collection system. In addition, biofilms (a complex structure of microorganisms and extracellular matrix) can be produced by bacteria on surfaces of urinary catheters. Biofilm formation can be associated with poor antimicrobial penetration, antimicrobial resistance, and treatment failure. 11 ",

In one study, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter spp were commonly identified in feline HA ventilatorassociated pneumonia cases. 14 Although not included in the human surveillance definition, aspiration pneumonia is not uncommon in small animal medicine and can occur in patients hospitalized for a wide range of disorders as well as otherwise healthy patients undergoing sedation or anesthesia.

However, there is little evidence indicating that contaminated but not infected catheters (ie, catheters from which bacteria can be isolated but where the catheter insertion site and vein are clinically normal) pose a risk for subsequent BSI. As a result, routine culture of catheters at time of removal or culture of catheter insertion sites is not recommended because skin bacteria are expected to be present.

The frequency of each pathogen varies for each veterinary practice (in part influenced by antimicrobial use/pressure, geography, animal species, vaccine coverage of animals in \"catchment\" area, level of care provided). In addition, environmentally stable pathogens (eg, parvovirus, clostridial spores, dermatophytes) have a demonstrated clear \"advantage,\" increasing the chance of transmission. Given the close interaction between veterinary staff and patients as well as the often poor hand hygiene practices documented in veterinary practices, human commensals with zoonotic potential are represented by HAIs in veterinary medicine.

Although a wide range of pathogens may be involved in HAIs, currently there is a strong focus on the emerging epidemic of multidrug-resistant bacteria because of dramatic increases in infections, limited antimicrobial options, and potential public health consequences. These MDROs are not inherently more virulent than antimicrobial susceptible organisms, but treatment options are limited, something that ultimately can worsen the prognosis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently assessed domestic antibiotic resistance threats for people based on Box 1 Pathogens of concern in a small animal clinic Hospital-Associated Infections clinical and economic impact, incidence, transmissibility, availability of effective antimicrobials, and barriers to prevention. Several pathogens of importance relative to veterinary HAIs were included as \"serious antibiotic resistance threats,\" namely, Acinetobacter spp, extended spectrum b-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBLs), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp, and MRSA. 27 As animals and people may share common infection sources or transmit these pathogens to each other, this concern is equally important in the veterinary field, and all of the abovenamed pathogens can be found in veterinary patients. Given these relatively novel threats and the often limited knowledge by veterinary personnel on this group of pathogens, the attention here is focused on MDROs as HAIs.",

            "text": "In human medicine, HAIs are often captured through voluntary or mandatory hospital reporting. As such, the occurrence (and trends) of HAIs are fairly well-established. In the United States, recent data indicate bacteria are responsible for 90% of HAIs, with commonly identified groups including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp, E coli, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Klebsiella spp, P aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp, and Acinetobacter baumannii. 28 Despite the importance of this field, current knowledge of many aspects of the epidemiology of important MDROs and pathogens responsible for HAIs in veterinary medicine is unclear (eg, prevalence, risk factors, and transmission dynamics). Unfortunately, companion animal veterinary medicine has been slow to implement surveillance systems; however, this is changing. Currently, most data come from limited retrospective studies of clinical isolates, likely resulting in geographic and culturebased bias, potentially misrepresenting the frequency of these pathogens and potentially overestimating the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance if culture submissions are biased toward infections that failed to respond to empirical therapy. Regardless, based on the reported veterinary HA outbreaks or supposition from the human literature, several important MDROs responsible for HAIs are identifiable: S aureus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Enterococci, Salmonella spp, Acinetobacter spp, E coli, and other Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas spp. The specific resistance profiles and treatment options for common multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens have recently been summarized. 29 The reader is directed to the article elsewhere in this issue of Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice by Guardabassi and Prescott entitled, \"Antimicrobial stewardship in small animal veterinary practice: from theory to practice,\" which expands on the topic of MDROs in HAIs and antimicrobial stewardship.",

The emergence of methicillin resistance in these species (methicillin-resistant S pseudintermedius [MRSP] and MRSA) has had important implications for HAI prevention and control. Methicillin resistance is mediated by the mecA gene, which results in resistance to b-lactam antimicrobials (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). In addition, resistance to other classes of antimicrobials is frequently observed: lincosamides (clindamycin), fluoroquinolones, macrolides (erythromycin), tetracyclines, trimethoprim-sulfonamides. 29, 31, 32 MRSA is an important pathogen in human HAIs, being a common cause of SSIs and various other types of infections. 33 To a lesser extent, MRSA has also been noted in veterinary HAIs. 34 Risk factors for veterinary MRSA HAIs have not been well studied, but prior antimicrobial use, prior hospitalization, ownership by veterinary or human health care workers/students, and longer hospitalization (>3 days) have been associated with MRSA colonization or infection in dogs. [35] [36] [37] [38] Furthermore, the use of fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins has been linked to the emergence of MRSA in people and may play a role in veterinary species. 39 It is important to note that an abnormally high proportion of veterinarians are colonized with MRSA as compared with the general public. 40 As such, they may serve as a source for HAIs in their patients if infection-control practices (notably hand hygiene) are substandard. This also likely indicates deficiencies in standard infection control and hygiene practices that allow for transmission of MRSA between veterinary personnel and animals.",

It is not unusual for HAI outbreaks to \"smolder\" below the radar of veterinary staff for extended periods because of the lack of centralized data reporting or communication, resulting in substantial environmental contamination, patient morbidity (and potentially mortality), and even increased zoonotic disease risk for staff and clients. Key elements of early HAI identification include (1) a surveillance program tailored to the risks and needs of the veterinary practice and (2) routine use of diagnostic culture and susceptibility data to establish practice-specific baseline levels of pathogen prevalence and antimicrobial resistance and detect changes from this baseline.",

In the human health care field, infection-control practitioners are formally trained and certified, with the infectioncontrol program typically overseen by a physician with specialized training in infectious diseases, infection control, and/or microbiology. In veterinary medicine, this type of approach is only practiced in large facilities (mainly teaching hospitals), yet the basic concepts remain the same for veterinary facilities of any type and size. A functional infection-control program can be directed by a single infectioncontrol practitioner in a veterinary hospital, with minimal time requirements. This individual can be a technician or veterinarian who has an interest in infection control. The skills required (eg, general understanding of infection-control concepts) can be obtained on the job and need not be a prerequisite for the position, and the limited time requirement under normal circumstances means that a new position does not need to be added. Rather, direction of the infection control can usually be undertaken by an existing staff member. Of greatest importance for the individual filling this position is an interest in the topic, motivation to make improvements in the clinic's infection-control policies, and the support of clinic leaders (eg, practice owners, veterinarians). Without full support by clinic leaders (eg, time to perform the required duties, financial investments, serving as a role model by following clinic infection-control policies), the infection-control officer, and resulting program, is unlikely to be successful.",

Prolonged hospitalization and the use of invasive devices and procedures increase the risk of HAIs. All staff members should be educated on the risks and signs associated with HAIs so that cases can be detected early and managed appropriately. Ultimately, a multifaceted approach is necessary to address HAIs in small animal veterinary medicine, including prudent antimicrobial use, strengthening surveillance of HAIs in companion animals, improving infection-control practices (eg, hand hygiene, PPE, cleaning and disinfection, patient management), instilling an infection-control culture among veterinary staff, and improving health care and public education of antimicrobials. A hospital infection-control program, consisting of an infectious disease control officer, a written protocol, and staff training, is a key component to unifying these elements and successful reduction of HAIs in small animal veterinary practice.",
