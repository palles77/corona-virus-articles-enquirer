            "text": "The first step in the study of RNA viruses at the nucleotide sequence level is the synthesis and cloning of cDNA. With established procedures [1] , clones with inserts of less than 2 kb, corresponding to the size of most cellular mRNA, may be obtained routinely. However, with long RNA templates, such as viral RNA genomes, longer inserts are essential for manipulation in subsequent steps such as mapping, sequencing, and expression in heterologous systems. Here we describe the testing of a number of conditions that were critical for the length of cDNA. Our optimized procedure was found to be applicable both to the specific priming with a synthetic oligonucleotide and to the random priming by pentanucleotides. Results have been obtained with a number of coronaviruses that compare favorably with results of other published procedures [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

NaOH-denatured DNA has also a higher mobility than DNA denatured by glyoxal ( Figure  1 ). This difference is too large to be explained solely by an increase in molecular weight by glyoxylation. Presumably, intramolecular base pairing in NaOH-denatured DNA, leading to a more compact shape, increases mobility. However, the same effect of NaOH denaturation has been observed with denatured cDNA. Therefore, denaturation by NaOH and electrophoresis in normal gels provides a fast and reliable way to estimate the length of cDNA strands, allowing the convenient use of the same gels as used normally for double-stranded DNA.",

We used the conventional system of dC homopolymer tailing and annealing with dG-tailed pUC9, after which JM109 was transformed by either the CaCI 2 or the Hanahan procedure [1] . Our procedure has been used for the construction of cDNA libraries for several coronavirus strains and types. Typically, about 80% of the clones hybridized to labeled viral RNA. Table  2 shows the results of the positive clones of four representative libraries. Apparently, our results compare favorably with other published procedures [2] [3] [4] [5] . The abundance of several clones with inserts of several kilobases obviated the need for a separate cDNA size selection by electropho-1988, Gene Anal Techn 5:57-61 f} resis or chromatography. Furthermore, the fidelity of the cloning procedure has been demonstrated by the complete absence of deletions or f3 shuffling in the many clones sequenced until now [6] [7] [8] .",

VAN DER ZEIJST Methods to make long and reliable cDNA from viral RNA template have been optimized. The conditions of the denaturation of the viral RNA template were most critical. For synthesis of the first DNA strand, the concentration of the primer and the presence of an RNase inhibitor were important. During the synthesis of the second strand, the incubation temperature was found to have effect on the length of the transcripts. Application of our optimized conditions on coronaviral genomic RNA as template resulted in cDNA libraries with inserts in the range of 0.5-5 kb without a separate cDNA size selection. Furthermore, a convenient variant of the alcohol precipitation and the analysis of single-stranded DNA on neutral agarose gels are described.",
