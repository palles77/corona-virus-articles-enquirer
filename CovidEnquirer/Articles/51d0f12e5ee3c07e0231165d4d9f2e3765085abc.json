            "text": "The influenza virus belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, which is divided into three types ( Fig. 14-1) . The pleomorphic viruses are enveloped and measure 60 to 120 \u00b5m in diameter. The genome consists of single-stranded ribonucleic acid. Influenza A virus is the only type of veterinary significance. Influenza viruses possess two surface antigens that are important to identify and control. The most important is hemagglutinin (H), which is responsible for the virus's ability to agglutinate erythrocytes and to attach and penetrate host cells. The other surface antigen is neuraminidase (N), which is involved in the release of newly formed viral particles from host cells. Influenza A viruses are classified into 16 antigenically distinct HA (H1-H16) and 9 NA (N1-N9) subtypes. Few subtype combinations have been isolated from mammalian species, but all subtypes in most of the possible combinations have been found in birds (World Health Organization, 1980; Spielman et al., 2004) . Subtypes H5, H7, and H9 possess a high pandemic potential (Webster and Hulse, 2004) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) isolates are restricted to subtypes H5 and N7. Aquatic birds, particularly ducks, are the reservoirs of influenza A virus, providing a source of novel subtypes that may one day infect mammals. The virus is often disseminated by migratory birds. It replicates in the intestinal tract of birds, which can result in fecal-oral transmission (Markey et al., 2013) . Detection of the virus of the H5 and H7 serotypes in avian species is notifiable to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Influenza viruses are relatively stable when outside the host, particularly in pond or lake water. In a cool environment, the virus remains infectious in feces for over a month. It can be destroyed in minutes by extremes in pH, heating to 56\u00b0 C, exposure to sunlight, and by most detergents and disinfectants.",

Work with HPAI isolates should be performed in high-security laboratories. Fowl plague was first reported in 1878 and 1901, causing using reference influenza A antisera. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques and real-time PCR, which are rapid assays, have been developed for the detection and subtype identification of virus in clinical samples. Commercial antigen-detection immunoassays have also been used for fast diagnosis. These tests detect any influenza A virus and are generally based on monoclonal antibodies. They should be used for screening because they lack sensitivity (see . In several occasions the test was positive only after culture in embryonated eggs or in cells. Serologic testing for antibodies to influenza virus can be performed using different serologic methods like the agar gel immunodiffusion test, hemagglutination inhibition test, or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.",

Nine avian paramyxovirus (APMV) serotypes have been differentiated so far (Box 14-1), and few strains have been isolated that could not be grouped (Telbis et al., 1989) . ND was first recognized in 1926 after large outbreaks in Java and Newcastle, UK. ND is a World Organization for Animal Health listed disease. APMV1 is divided into two classes based on genetic analysis. Strains of class II have been isolated from wild or domestic birds and include virulent and avirulent isolates, whereas class I strains are avirulent, and both have been found in wild birds (Briand et al., 2014) .",

It is necessary to isolate NDV from infected birds and characterize the virus to exclude viruses of low virulence, which are ubiquitous in feral birds throughout the world, and live vaccines. The virus may be isolated from spleen, brain, or lung by allantoic inoculation of 10-to 12-day-old embryonated eggs or through infection of tissue culture chicken embryo fibroblasts. NDV is differentiated from other viruses by hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition and neurotropic pathotypes with diarrhea and nervous signs. Falcons suffering from PMV1 infections initially show gastrointestinal signs such as anorexia, vomiting, and paralytic ileus. Later in the course of the disease central nervous system signs develop. These signs are associated with ataxia, head tics, tremors, wing and leg paralysis and, tests using polyclonal antisera. An assessment of the virulence of an NDV isolate is important and a number of in vivo tests are available like the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and the intravenous pathogenicity index performed on specific pathogen-free chicken of different ages (Hitchner et al., 1980) . The mean death time, which is performed by inoculating the allantoic cavity of 9-to 10-day-old embryos, classifies isolates as velogenic (less than 60 hours to kill), mesogenic (60-90 hours to kill), and lentogenic (more than 90 hours to kill). Molecular techniques like real-time RT-PCRs have been used to detect NDV in clinical specimens such as oropharyngeal or fecal swabs.",

The classification of viruses within the family Herpesviridae is complex and not yet fully resolved. The family is divided into three subfamilies: Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae, and Gammaherpesvirinae.

Classification into genera on the basis of the genome arrangement and serologic reactivity has just begun. The characteristic property of all herpesviruses is their lifelong persistence in the organism. They survive from generation to generation by establishing latent infections from which virus is periodically reactivated and shed. recently described in magnificent frigatebirds, which is named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus.

Strains of the virus vary considerably in virulence but are antigenically homogenous. Infectious laryngotracheitis is an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease of domestic fowl characterized by distressed breathing with loud gasping, coughing, and expectoration of bloody mucus. However, signs and lesions can vary from peracute to mild. Birds of all ages are susceptible but disease is most common in those aged 4 to 18 months. In peracute infectious laryngotracheitis mortality can exceed 50% of the flock, and in acute infectious laryngotracheitis mortality is reduced to 10% to 15%, although morbidity is as high as in the peracute form. Chronic or mild infectious laryngotracheitis forms are of low morbidity and mortality (2% to 5%). The disease is always accompanied by lowered egg production. In infectious laryngotracheitis, there is severe laryngotracheitis characterized by necrosis, hemorrhage, ulceration, and the formation of diphtheritic membranes. Bloody mucoid pseudomembranes (casts) along the trachea lead to death through asphyxiation. The extensive diphtheritic membrane formation and death from asphyxia prompted the designation \"fowl diphtheria.\" Infections with infectious laryngotracheitis virus are transmitted by direct or indirect contact but are not transmitted within eggs from infected chickens. The virus is shed through conjunctival excretions, tracheal mucus, and feces. The virus can become latent in the trigeminal ganglia of infected birds. Carrier birds shed the infectious laryngotracheitis virus intermittently throughout their lives.",

Avian poxviruses produce pocks on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated hen's eggs, and viruses grow productively, but also abortively, in avian cell lines (Samour et al., 1996) . The virus multiplies in the cytoplasm of infected cells with the formation of inclusion bodies (Bollinger bodies) or elementary bodies (Borrel bodies), which can be stained with different staining methods. The specificity of the viral inclusions can be determined by fluorescent antibody and immunoperoxidase methods. Suitable serologic tests for the detection of antibodies include passive hemagglutination, agar gel immunodiffusion test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.",

Rarely, it occurs among free-living birds that have become otherwise debilitated through injury or inanition. Although it may occur in individuals of virtually any species, there are clearly species predilections. Among North American raptors, goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), gyr falcons (Falco rusticolus), immature redtailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and snowy owls (Nyctea scandiaca) are more likely to develop the disease. There is a tendency for raptors originating from arctic or subarctic climates to be more susceptible. A very useful and comprehensive review of aspergillosis in birds was published by Beernaert et al. (2010) . Several species of Aspergillus (A. nigricans, A. terreus, A. nidulans, A. glaucus, and A. flavus) may be involved in any of the common forms of this disease. In most clinical presentations among captive companion and falconry birds, A. fumigatus is by far the most commonly encountered organism. However, the occurrence of other species can lead to some of the variations seen in pathogenesis and response to treatment. Additionally, available serologic tests are highly specific for A. fumigatus and do not necessarily detect antibodies formed in response to one of the other species.",

A commercially available goat antiturkey conjugate adequately recognized immunoglobulins from Buteo species of raptors; however, specific conjugates must be made for use in falcons, accipiters, owls, or psittacines. ( The route of infection is inhalation, rendering the respiratory system the main target organ. Direct deposition of spores in the air on exposed vulnerable surfaces may also occur. Among parrots, and occasionally raptors, the upper respiratory system is often affected (sinuses, larynx, and syrinx). The most serious disease occurs with infection of the lower respiratory system (lungs and air sacs). Spores in the lower respiratory system can migrate widely throughout the coelomic cavity by the ramifying and interconnecting air sac system that reaches into every part of the body. Consequently, lesions may be found in the pericardium, on the kidneys, in the mesenteries, and among the vertebral bodies of the spinal column. Although the respiratory system provides an ideal environment in which the thermophilic, oxyphilic Aspergillus fungus can grow, the organism is an opportunist and may colonize on superficial damaged epithelial and mucosal tissues.

Moldy silage, leaf piles, bales of straw or shavings, and eucalyptus bark have been implicated as sources. In one situation, it was felt that the source of the spores was a mown field of alfalfa, adjacent to and downwind of the weathering yard in which a gyr falcon was housed, which had been rained on before it was finally raked and baled.

With the large-scale production of gyr falcons and gyr hybrids through captive breeding and used in falconry, the number of encounters of birds with this disease have increased markedly in the last two decades. The disease most often becomes apparent at about the time the birds are becoming hard-penned, at approximately 10 weeks of age. Postmortem examination reveals extensive involvement of the air sacs and lungs, suggesting that the process has been ongoing for several weeks. The premise of immunosuppression or exposure to large numbers of spores from a point source does not appear to apply, as affected birds are typically raised in carefully monitored and managed facilities, provided with an abundance of nutritional food, and raised without overt evidence of stress. It is possible that the juvenile gyr falcon is constitutionally unable to defend itself against ambient exposure to Aspergillus spores. Other possibilities may include immunosuppression by exposure to high ambient temperatures occurring in temperate zones (where the majority of propagation occurs) in late July and early August when the greatest number of cases are seen, or exposure to some immunosuppressive, clinically unapparent viral agent. Another possibility is that the captive-raised gyr falcon is affected by unrecognized psychological stresses arising from a mismatch between the normal development it would experience in the wild in an Arctic environment and containment, relocation, or other artifacts of rearing in captivity. Research into these issues is necessary to reduce the incidence of this disease in young gyr falcons.",

ELISA is a good screening test and, when used in conjunction with other parameters, aids the clinician in establishing a diagnosis. Its availability is presently limited and it is species or group specific, depending on immunoprotein recognition by antibodies produced in goats or rabbits. As such, a specific custom-made conjugate-labeled antibody is needed for psittacines, falcons, and accipiters, whereas immunoglobulins of other species of diurnal raptor cross-react well with a commercially available goat or rabbit antiturkey conjugate.

Amphotericin B is the gold standard against which other antifungal agents are compared in vitro. Amphotericin B, along with 5FC, itraconazole, and clotrimazole, and particularly the last two in combination, is efficacious in treating known cases of aspergillosis; fluconazole appears to be ineffective. Enilconazole and ketoconazole have also been used with a modicum of success by individual clinicians. Itraconazole is the most widely used antifungal agent at present, but work done in 2004 with voriconazole indicates that this recently available compound may have greater clinical utility than other forms of treatment (Di Somma et al., 2004) . This drug was found to be effective in treating clinical cases of aspergillosis in falcons when dosed at 12.5 mg/kg (twice a day for 3 to 5 days in heavily infected birds and then once a day for 3 to 6 weeks depending on severity), although further work has suggested that multiple doses may need to be given to maintain inhibitory concentrations throughout the day (Scope et al., 2005) .

The recommended protocol is to administer an antifungal (itraconazole or voriconazole) for 3 weeks. Gyr falcons will tolerate itraconazole only up to a dose of 8 mg/kg. The course of treatment may be extended if clinical indications warrant. This approach also should extend to individuals of highly susceptible species that are undergoing a change of management (e.g., transfer to new owner or new enclosure), regardless of age or other circumstance. Treatment for 1 week before the move and 2 weeks after is recommended.

A lymphoplasmacytic inflammation is common in birds with heavy M. ornithogaster growth, but is less likely in birds with minimal superficial colonization of the organism (Phalen, 2013).",

In many of these trials, the measure of successful treatment was the cessation of M. ornithogaster shedding in the feces, as opposed to the less common trial where treated birds were killed and the stomach examined directly (Filippich and Perry, 1993; Kheirandish and Salehi, 2011; Phalen, 2013) . While it is likely that the cessation of shedding may be the result of a cure, it is also possible that some of these treated birds may have remained infected at low levels. Amphotericin B is used widely to treat M. ornithogaster and appears to be effective and safe when administered orally by gavage and in some circumstances in water. Various doses have been recommended. The author has used 100 mg/kg twice a day for 14 days with direct oral administration, but has been gradually reducing the amount and is now using 25 mg/kg twice a day for 14 days with apparent success. Success of treatment has been judged by the rapid cessation of M. ornithogaster shedding and resolution of signs. Amphotericin B can be purchased as a powder (Gallipot, St. Paul, MN) and compounded into a formula that can be given orally. The 2.5% water-soluble powder from Vetafarm (Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia) that has been used extensively in the past is no longer available. There is one report of M. ornithogaster resistant to amphotericin B. How widespread the resistance may be is not known (Phalen, 2013) .",

Treatment attempts with trials of sodium benzoate in drinking water in live birds have been performed by the author and others. The author's experiences have not been uniformly successful, and in many cases, shedding and clinical signs have not resolved (Phalen, 2013) . The reason for the failure of treatment in these instances is not known, but adequate consumption of the treated water may be to blame. In another trial where a flock of breeding budgerigars was treated, M. ornithogaster shedding stopped but some of the treated birds died. The cause of the deaths was not determined but could have been the result of sodium toxicity. Water consumption in the treated budgerigars was very high because they were feeding young and it was the middle of the summer and daytime temperatures were very high (Phalen, 2013). Trials of potassium benzoate have not been performed, but it may be safer than sodium benzoate because it is more difficult to get potassium toxicity from ingested potassium than it is to get sodium toxicity from ingested sodium. The use of any of these chemicals requires additional research before they can be recommended for routine use. There are many potential sources of sodium and potassium benzoate. The product used by the author is purchased as a 99% pure product (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).",

Less frequently, lesions affect other parts of the body such as the neck, the legs, and the leading edge of the wings. However, Baker (1996) recorded unilateral feather loss of the body caused by a Trichophyton sp. in a budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). In most cases partial or complete alopecia is present and the skin becomes thickened and corrugated, grayish white or yellowish in color, and sometimes with the formation of encrustations and scabs. Crusty exudates may occur around the feather follicles. Sometimes the skin lesions are rough and porous in appearance. Usually there is little evidence of pruritus. Tudor (1983) isolated a Paecilomyces sp. and Mucor circinelloides from the feather shafts of pigeons (Columba livia) and various psittacines, which he regarded as the cause of pruritus and feather pulling. Some mycotic infections were associated with bacteria. In a recent report, a 16-month-old black Orpington hen (Gallus gallus domesticus) was taken to a veterinarian with clinical signs of intense pruritus and progressively worse feather loss for a month. At examination, the head showed considerable feather loss and white crusting on the unfeathered areas of the skin including typical scutula around the base of the feather follicles. These are saucer-like crustings that are characteristic of favus infections. The aural cavity was inflamed and contained a large amount of caseous exudates. The rest of the body, including the neck, underneath the wings, and on the legs, also showed considerable feather loss. Histopathology of biopsies obtained from the head and neck revealed follicles with multifocal suppurative folliculitis with intralesional fungal organisms, follicular keratosis, multifocal epithelial cell degeneration, and severe chronic lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic perifolliculitis. On PAS staining, multifocal aggregates of variable-sized, pink-stained round conidia 0.5 to 1 um in diameter were observed. Based on the morphologic characteristics, the fungal bodies observed in the sample were most likely Microsporum sp. The hen was treated with grisovin 125 mg once a day for a period of 3 months, making significant improvement (Baron and Doneley, 2014) . Hine et al. (1990) recorded candidiasis of the uropygial gland of chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica). Forbes (personal communication, 1997) also encountered Malassezia sp. (a yeast-like fungus) associated with feather loss and greasy skin in Harris's hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus) and found Candida and Aspergillus spp. to be relatively common secondary infective agents in chronic bumblefoot, especially when the foot remains bandaged for long periods with infrequent dressing changes. Sartory (1942) recorded Aspergillus fumigatoides var. roseus n. sp. as pathogenic to the feathers of pigeons (C. livia). Krautwald-Junghanns (1990) described favus in parrots (Amazona spp.) associated with Aspergillus spp., namely A. fumigatus and A. niger. She also described pruritus caused by Mucor spp. in African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus), small parakeets, and other species. She said that in these infections the fungi may spread to the respiratory system and cause death. According to Perry (1987) Helminthosporium spp. infection of the skin and feathers in psittacines can cause extensive feather loss.",

However, since then, several other fungicidal agents have been developed. For example, Broadbent (1994) reported the successful treatment of T. mentagrophytes infection of an ostrich (Struthio camelus) using three treatments with natamycin (Mycophyt, Mycofarm) at 4-day intervals followed by \"three soakings\" with an enilconazole emulsion (Imaverol, Janssen Pharmaceuticals) at 3-day intervals. The natamycin only reduced the scabbing, but subsequent use of enilconazole produced total resolution. Forbes (personal communication, 1997) described treatment of cutaneous aspergillosis in a goshawk (Accipiter gentilis; Fig. 14-11) . Hine et al. (1990) satisfactorily treated candidiasis of the uropygial gland of penguins by feeding them fish containing itraconazole (Sporanox, Janssen Pharmaceuticals) at a dosage rate of 10 mg/kg/day for 20 days. For the treatment of favus caused by M. gallinae, Bradley et al. (1995) recommended miconazole nitrate 2% (Micatin, Advanced Care Products).

In addition, they also benefit from transportation (phoresy) and distribution. In contrast to commensalists, mutualists, and symbionts, the parasite harms its host. Parasites are a heterogenic group of organisms consisting of protozoans, helminths, and arthropods. Depending on their location parasites can be divided into ectoparasites, living on the surface of the host (on the skin and in feathers) and endoparasites, living in the host's organs, blood, or tissues. Most avian arthropods are ectoparasites whereas protozoans and helminths are endoparasites. Temporary parasites have only short contact with the host, mainly for feeding (mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks), and steady parasites spend their whole life or a considerable span of the life cycle on or in the host (protozoa, helminths, and lice). A division between periodic and permanent parasites is useful for ectoparasites. The life cycle of parasite species may include free-living stages. These species are called periodic parasites (fleas, mosquitoes, chigger mites, and myiasis flies). Contrary to this, species where all stages have a parasitic lifestyle are called permanent parasites (ticks, most of the mites, lice, and bugs). Host-specific parasites can be grouped into stenoxenous (with a narrow host range: Eimeria spp., lice, feather mites, louse flies) and euryxenous species (with a broad host spectrum: Isospora lacacei, bed bugs). Life cycles can be simple, including only one host (homoxenous parasites) or complex by involving one or more intermediate hosts before reaching the definitive host, where maturation and sexual development occurs (heteroxenous parasites). Usually parasites are considered as pests, but parasites with complex life-cycles are sensitive to environmental changes and can therefore be indicators for the integrity of habitats.",

Pigeon nestlings become infected via feeding on \"pigeon milk\" produced in the crop of the adults and raptors become infected when feeding on infected prey. T. gallinae can reach other birds (turkeys, chickens and passerines) via contaminated drinking water when infected pigeons and other wild birds have access to the same water source.

A single flagellum may be present when trophozoites are in the cecal lumen. Parasites in lesions of the cecal wall or in mucosal tissue of the liver lack flagellum.

Representatives of the genera Eimeria, Isospora, Tyzzeria, and Caryospora are typical pathogens belonging to the family Eimeriidae. They are host-specific parasites of epithelial cells, mainly of the intestine. The life cycle of Eimeria, Isospora, and Tyzzeria is direct and does not require intermediate hosts but is characterized by an alteration of asexual and sexual multiplying generations. In life cycles of Caryospora species intermediate hosts may be involved. Caryospora sporozoites invade host tissues but stay dormant. In a database on avian Eimeriidae compiled by Duszynski et al. (1998) , 224 Eimeria and 401 Isospora species were mentioned. Most of the Eimeria species (n = 68) were described in galliform birds, while passeriform birds had the greatest variety of Isospora species (n = 347). The same source listed 21 avian Caryospora species; most of them were described in birds of prey and owls. Of the 11 known species of the genus Tyzzeria, six occur in birds. The status of two Wenyonella species described in ducks in India is uncertain. Despite the large number of above mentioned pathogens coccideans in free-ranging birds usually are not of clinical importance. The main morphologic differences in oocysts between the above mentioned genera can be seen after sporulation: 1. Eimeria: Four sporocysts with two sporozoites in each (quadrosporocystic, diplosporozoit) 2. Isospora: Two sporocysts with four sporozoites in each (diplosporocystic, tetrasporozoic) 3. Caryospora: One sporocyst with eight sporozoites (monosporocystic, octosporozoit) 4. Tyzzeria: No sporocyst, eight sporozoites in oocyst (asporocystic, octosporozoit) 5. Wenyonella: Four sporocysts with four sporozoites in each (quadrosporocystic, quadrosporozoit) According to Yabsley (2008) , 197 known avian Eimeria species parasitize 162 avian hosts. Most of the known species occur in galliform followed by anseriform, charadriiform, and gruiform birds. Ten bird orders do not contain any Eimeria host. The homoxenous life cycle of Eimeria coccidia has been intensively studied in species infecting commercial poultry and consists of endogenous schizogony followed by gamogony (Fig. 14-88 ) and exogenous sporulation resulting in the formation of sporulated oocysts (Fig. 14-89) . Most of the avian coccideans complete their life cycle in the alimentary tract and only a few cases of an extra intestinal location of development stages are known (Table 14 -15).",

Compared with the genus Eimeria, avian Isospora species are less host specific. Thus I. lacacei has been described in more than 100 passerine birds and intrafamiliar host specificity is suggested for the Isospora genus. Most of the descriptions of avian Isospora species were based on the morphology of their oocysts and because oocysts were excreted with host feces, it was assumed that these species have strictly intestinal cycles similar to those of Eimeria spp. Extraintestinal development stages found in macrophages in canaries and in the viscera of sparrows with concurrent Isospora infection were allocated to new genera, Atoxoplasma and Lankesterella, respectively. However, it was shown experimentally that these parasites could not be transmitted by blood transfusion but only by ingestion of Isospora oocysts. Using the example of canary Isospora, it was shown experimentally that the development of some species (I. canaria) is restricted to the intestinal epithelium, while sporozoites of others (I. serini) penetrate into macrophages within the intestinal mucosa and are transported to various organs where further multiplication takes place. Because the above mentioned extraintestinal forms were developmental stages of Isospora and did not belong to other parasites, the recognition of Atoxoplasma and Lankesterella could no longer be justified and they are now treated as junior synonyms. Thus independent of the course of the life cycle all coccideans with diplosporocystic, tetrasporozoite oocysts and a single polar Stieda body were assigned to the genus Isospora (Fig. 14-90) . Coccidia of the genus Caryospora are phylogenetically old parasites with most of the species occurring in reptiles. Among the 15 Caryospora species identified in raptors and owls, six are found exclusively in the Falconidae family (Table 14-16). Their oocysts are large and spherical to ovoid without a micropyle. Their sporocysts lack Stieda bodies and enclose eight stubby sporozoites and a residuum (Fig.  14-91) . Caryospora species have a facultative diheteroxenic (predatorprey) life cycle where facultative intermediate hosts (mainly rodents) become infected by ingesting sporulated oocysts. It is assumed that sporozoites invade extraintestinal tissues of the intermediate host, stay dormant as hypnozoites, and do not undergo multiplication. Feeding experiments using C. kutzeri revealed a slightly shorter prepatent period compared with direct transmission. Along with raptors and owls, Caryospora species were detected in gulls (C. argentati and C. undata), in the European robin (C. jiroveci), and in the Cuban blackbird (C. gloriae). Another undescribed species was recently found in farmed African houbara bustards (R. K. Schuster, unpublished information).",

C. baileyi is the most frequent avian species but C. meleagridis is able to infect humans, as well as causing up to 10% of cases of human cryptosporidiosis. Two other species, C. anserinum from geese and C. tyzzeri, were not adequately described and are considered nomina nuda. Avian cryptosporidiosis manifests in respiratory disease, enteritis, and renal disease. The route of infection is orally with a life cycle similar to Eimeriidae including merogony followed by gamogony. A certain proportion of the oocysts is not excreted and causes autoinfections. C. baileyi can enter the host when oocysts are placed on the conjunctiva. Cryptosporidium oocysts are small and contain four naked sporozoites.

With the exception of representatives of the family Schistosomatidae (Fig. 14-95) , all avian trematodes are hermaphrodites.

The majority of flukes inhabit the intestinal tract, but some have adapted to other organs/cavities. All Schistosomatidae species, e.g., occur in the circulatory system (Fig. 14-96) .

The digestive system of nematodes is tubular with a mouth opening that may be surrounded by lips (Fig. 14-109) . In some species the mouth opens into a buccal cavity. The esophagus in many of the nematodes is divided into a muscular and glandular part. It is followed by the intestine that opens at the posterior end. In ascarids, both esophagus and intestine at their junction may have blind-ending appendices. The esophagus of hairworms has a capillary form surrounded by a single column of cells known as stichosome. Nematodes are unisexual parasites. The female reproductive system comprises an ovary, oviduct, and uterus which may be paired. The male organs consist of a single testes and a vas deferens terminating in an ejaculatory duct into the cloaca.

The egg-shaped body is dorsoventrally flattened with defined margins. The surface cuticle has a leather like and unsclerotized structure. The capitulum with mouthparts can be seen only from the ventral side. Like all argasids, Argas species are nocturnal. They shelter in cracks and cleaves and they leave only for blood meals. Soft ticks have a multihost life cycle including adults, eggs, and one larval and up to four nymphal stages. The whole life cycle depends on environmental conditions and the availability of hosts and lasts between 3 and 6 months and up to 3 years. In the absence of hosts, adult soft ticks can fast for several years. Apart from blood feeding, these parasites are vectors and can transmit Borrelia anserina and Aegyptianella pullorum. In the absence of preferred hosts, avian soft ticks also attack humans and become pests, especially in cities with feral pigeon problems.",

The red mite or poultry mite, Dermanyssus gallinae, is a stationary periodical, nocturnally active, euryxenous pest that shelters at daytime in hideaways (cracks and cleaves in poultry houses, below perches, bird nests, etc.) and attack their host in the dark to suck blood. In the absence of hosts these mites can survive up to 5 months. The northern fowl mite, Ornithonyssus sylviarum of the family Macronyssidae is a serious pest of poultry and wild birds in northern Europe and America, while the tropical fowl mite, O. bursa, is widely distributed in warmer climates (Fig. 14-120) . Both Ornithonyssus spp. are stationary permanent parasites that can survive only 3 weeks when separated from their hosts. In the absence of avian hosts D. gallinae and Ornithonyssus spp. can attack mammals and even humans.

Parasitic insect groups of importance for birds are bugs, biting lice, mosquitoes, blackflies, biting midges, myiasis-causing flies, louse flies, fleas as true parasites and beetles as pests. Beetles are also important intermediate hosts for Serratospiculum spp. (Samour and Naldo, 2001 ) and related nematodes. Insects differ from ticks and mites by the presence of three pairs of legs and the clear division of the body into caput, thorax and abdomen. Their mouthparts consist of paired mandibles, maxillae, labrium and unpaired labrum and hypopharynx. Depending on lifestyle and food uptake they can be modified as bitinglicking (biting lice), licking-sucking (housefly), or piercing-sucking (sucking lice, bugs, and fleas). With very few exceptions insects are oviparous. Most insects have a holometabolic development that consists of egg, larva, pupa, and imago. Lice and bugs and some other groups undergo a hemimetabolic development (incomplete metamorphosis), where larval stages are similar to adults and a pupal stage is missing. Temporarily periodic bloodsucking insects differ in their main activity. Diurnal species are active during the day while nocturnal species are active during the night. Crepuscular insects prefer the twilight as the main activity period.",

Other calliphorids associated with avian myiasis include Calliphora and Lucilia species in Europe. Also Wohlfahrtia magnifica in the Old World and W. opaca in the New World can cause myiasis in birds.

Their larval development takes place in the uterus and the female gives birth to fully developed larvae ready to pupate. The family has three subfamilies consisting of approximately 213 different species. While all species of the subfamily Lipopteninae parasitize mammals, most of the Ornithomyinae species parasitize birds. Ten of the 16 genera of this subfamily have species associated with birds. The best known are Crataerina hirundinis, parasites of swallows and martins; C. acutipennis, C. melbae, C. pacifica, and C. pallida, parasites of swifts; and the pigeon louse fly, Pseudolynchia canariensis (Fig. 14-129) . The life cycle of stenoxenous Crataerina species of migrating birds appears to be temperature mediated and associated with the presence of hosts at nesting sites. On return from winter habitats swifts are louse fly free and become infected with freshly hatched parasites. At the beginning of the season, transmission seems to be horizontal, and during the breeding season transmission is undoubtedly vertical from adults to nestlings. Hippoboscids have a low fecundity and produce only 12 to 15 larvae deposited in the nest. Most of the pupae are produced during the nesting period. Pupae remain in diapause until the following spring. C. pallida takes blood meals of 20 to 40 mg every 5 days. They feed on the lower rump of nestlings. On adults they are often found feeding on the belly and neck. P. canariensis was found on a wide range of avian hosts (13 families in eight orders) but columbiform birds are the main hosts. The main distribution of pigeon louse flies is in tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas with mild winters. In contrast to C. pallida, its pupae die at low temperatures. The longevity of pigeon louse fly imagines was determined experimentally and lasts 17 days when fed at 24-hour intervals. During this time, a female produces an average of nine pupae. P. canariensis can transmit Haemoproteus columbae. The infection with this hemoparasite is tolerated by adult pigeons but may be fatal in nestlings. H. turtur is another species transmitted by the vector. It is very host specific for turtle doves. Mallophages and a number of avian-associated mites are found to be phorets on P. canariensis. The subfamily Hippoboscinae contains one avian species, Struthiobosca struthionis, a parasite of ostriches (Struthio camelus) in East and South Africa.",

            "text": "The order Siphopnaptera consists of approximately 2500 described species in 239 genera and 19 families. Fleas are small, wingless, and obligate hematophagous parasites of warm-blooded vertebrates. Their size ranges from 1.6 to 9 mm. The compact, laterally compressed body bears caudal-directed spines and bristles in a species-specific pattern and most species are equipped with combs of spines. Males are usually smaller than females and sexes differ in the structure of antennae. In veterinary important species, the third pair of legs is stronger than the others and is well adapted for jumping. Both sexes are hematophagous with piercing-sucking mouthparts. Fleas have a holometabolic development. Female flies deposit eggs on substrates in the environment of the host. Three worm-like instars have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic substrates (hair, dandruff, and dead insects). Feces of the adult fleas that contain undigested dry blood may be a requirement for the development of some species. Larvae pupate on the ground covering themselves in a silk cocoon to which, with dust and other fine particles, they adhere. After 1 to 2 weeks fleas are ready to hatch stimulated by vibration that signals the presence of a suitable host. The vast majority of fleas have mammals as hosts and only 6% of the species prefer avian hosts. Only five families (Ceratophyllidae, Leptopsyllidae, Pulicidae, Pygiopsyllidae, and Rhopalopsyllidae) contain avian-related species. Fourteen species of the genus Ceratophyllus (Fig. 14-130) were detected in bird nests in Europe. Of these, C. gallinae, C. tribulis, and C. garei were found to have a broad host spectrum including 20 to 60 birds. C. sciurorum has rodents (dormice, tree squirrels, and yellownecked and wood mice) as main hosts but also has been detected in nests of more than 30 bird species. The moorhen fly, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, which originally was distributed in South America, was also detected in Europe and is considered low host specific. Species with a narrow host range were C. fringillae, C. styx, C. hirundinis, C. borealis, C. rossittensis, C. rusticus, C. vagabundus, C. columbae, and Ornithophaga mikulini of the family Leptopsyllidae. Echidnophaga gallinacea (Fig. 14-131) , known as the hen flea, belongs to the family Pulicidae and has a cosmopolitan distribution. It is one of the 21 species of sticktight fleas more commonly seen on mammals. The host spectrum of hen fleas is not restricted to avian hosts; it can also be found on carnivores, rodents, horses, and even humans. Contrary to the abovementioned species, females of E. gallinacea are stationary periodic parasites (Fig. 14-132) . Fluke-armed ledges on their maxilla allow sticktight fleas to be attached to the host as long as 3 weeks.",

When an infected vector bites a new host, parasite sporozoites are passed into the blood, where they eventually reach the liver and undergo development into preerythrocytic schizonts. These produce merozoites, which enter the erythrocytes and develop into macrogametocytes (female) or microgametocytes (male) or segmenters (asexual schizonts). All stages contain melanin pigment granules. The merozoites produced from asexual schizonts repeat the erythrocytic cycle. The intraerythrocytic merogony cycles continue indefinitely unless the host's immune system or death intervenes. Thus there is a potential for persistence of infection with frequent relapses. Second-generation and subsequent generations of exoerythrocytic schizonts may occur in tissues other than the liver. In early infections, only trophozoites and schizonts may occur in erythrocytes, so specific diagnosis is difficult. Likewise, in established infections only gametocytes may be present and if these are of a species with an elongated form they can easily be confused with those of Haemoproteus. In these situations molecular techniques may provide a more definitive diagnosis. Some avian species of Plasmodium are known to occur only in the type host from which the parasite was originally described. Other Plasmodium spp. are found in a wide range of hosts and families and often the morphology is markedly different. This frequently makes a definitive diagnosis to species level difficult unless tissue stages and vectors are also known. Specific clinical signs of Plasmodium infection are lacking, but listlessness, lethargy, and anemia may be indicators of the disease. Generally Plasmodium spp. are more pathogenic in domestic birds: P. gallinaceum in chickens (frequent involvement of brain schizonts), P. durae in turkeys, and P. circumflexum in ducks and geese. The species that occurs most in free-living birds is P. relictum, which has been recorded in over 380 hosts from 74 families.

Melanin pigment granules tend to be evenly distributed in macrogametocytes but more clustered in polar positions in microgametocytes. The pigment granules are similar to those of Plasmodium but are frequently larger. There are approximately 169 species of Haemoproteus (Peirce, 2005 and unpublished observations), the majority of which are host specific to the family level and can be divided into five distinct morphologic forms (Bennett and Peirce, 1988) : microhalteridial, halteridial, circumnuclear, rhabdosomal, and discosomal. Halteridial species are most common and account for the largest group (65%). The vectors are known for only 12 species, and 10 of these are transmitted by Culicoides spp. Only two are transmitted by hippoboscids. Schizonts of Haemoproteus occur in a wide range of organs but are usually most frequent in the lung and liver tissue. Few species of Haemoproteus are known to be pathogenic; H. meleagridis in turkeys, H. nettionis in ducks and geese, and H. columbae in pigeons and doves are the general exceptions. No definitive clinical signs of haemoproteid infection are applicable, but the general observations pertaining to Plasmodium infections also can be considered to apply to Haemoproteus.

They are large (16 to 120 mm), thick yellowish-white worms parasitizing the small intestine and sometimes the ceca of susceptible hosts. Females are often larger than males. Ascarids have a simple, direct life cycle. Nonembryonated, elliptical thick-walled single-cell eggs with fine granular brownish contents and colorless shell (approximately 80 \u00d7 50 \u00b5m) are shed in feces and embryonate in the environment with appropriate humidity and temperature in 2 to 3 weeks. Infective eggs hatch in the proventriculus or duodenum of the susceptible host releasing second-stage larvae that will invade small intestine mucosa where they molt to L3. Depending on the species and host, larvae either return to the intestinal lumen where they molt and mature into adult worms or they may arrest their development at certain stage (i.e., L3) to become the predominant form of the parasite and become its reservoir throughout the life of the host. Ascarids may use transport or paratenic hosts, such as earthworms or grasshoppers, but they do not develop or accumulate in them.",

Capillarids are small, 8 to 60 mm long, and thin (less than 100 \u00b5m wide) nematodes burying in the mucosa of the GIT. They are almost impossible to see with the naked eye (thus the name hairworm). Freshly passed, unembryonated eggs are characteristically double operculated with distinctive, big plugs at both ends ( Fig. 14-178 ). Ova may be symmetric or asymmetric (long axis through one plug not meeting opposite plug). They, are single cell with fine granular contents, various patterns of shell and coloration (colorless, golden brown, and bile green), measuring on average 55 \u00d7 25 \u00b5m.

            "text": "\u2022 Northern mite (O. sylviarum, Family: Macronyssidae) is a common ectoparasite of cage birds and poultry. Northern mites are dark colored (red to black), flattened eight-legged (nymphs and adults) parasitic arthropods, approximately 0.7 to 1 mm in length and 0.4 mm in width. They spend the entire life cycle on their avian hosts (c.f., red mite). Five developmental stages have been described: egg, larva, protonymph, deuteronymph, and adult. Only protonymphs and adults are hematophagous. The life cycle (from egg to egg-laying female) can be completed in 5 to 7 days under favorable conditions (18 to 20\u00b0 C; northern mites prefer lower temperatures than red mites). Adult females lay two to five eggs at the base of feathers (especially in the vent or back) about 2 days after feeding on blood. Birds are the only suitable hosts for northern mites, but parasites can bite and parasitize (but not reproduce) on other animals and humans. Depending on the source, northern mites are reported to stay alive in the environment, outside their host, for several days up to 2 months. \u2022 Red mites (D. gallinae, Family: Dermanyssidae) are small (1 mm length, 0.4 mm width), whitish-gray colored mites that turn red when engorged with blood. The main difference in clinical importance between northern and red mites is that the latter enter birds only for feeding during the night, while the rest of their life cycle takes place outside the host (it is considered a temporary parasite). The white (0.4 \u00d7 0.25 mm) eggs are laid in hiding places including all kinds of nooks and crannies in aviaries and cages, nests, and nesting material but also dry manure and litter. Depending on the temperature and humidity (red mites prefer temperatures of 25\u00b0 C or more and high humidity) eggs hatch in 2 to 3 days. Developmental stages are the same as in the northern mite, and the life cycle may be completed in 7 to 10 days. Protonymphs, deuteronymphs, and adults are hematophagous. The mites feed for about 60 minutes every 2 to 4 days. The majority are active and feed after dark, but some may remain on the host during the daytime. Red mites enter birds from perches but they may also drop from the ceiling. They are attracted to birds because of their high temperature and skin lipids.",

Parasitic Diseases Diagnosis \u2022 Northern mite: Includes finding dark colored mites, mite debris (shed skins, dried blood, and mite feces), and masses of eggs (attached to the base of feathers, especially on vent and rump) on live or dead birds. In passerine birds the neck apterium is a particularly useful site to examine for the presence of northern mites. In poultry, the best site is the vent area. Sometimes eggs can be found on the base of the feathers (Fig. 14-186) . The tape strip method can be very useful to detect the parasites on a living bird (Fig. 14-187 ). \u2022 Red mite: Includes finding red-colored mites (red when gorged with blood, white when fastened) during the nighttime on birds and during daytime in hiding places. Red mites are often found accidentally by finding smudges of blood on the underside of perches or furnishing from accidentally crushed parasites when exposed during cleaning (especially detaching perches, feeders, etc.). When facing anemia, respiratory distress, and deaths, especially in nestlings, even without visible presence of parasites on birds, red mites should always be considered as possible culprits. \u2022 Mites (northern and red), their excrements, and dried blood can be found in the nesting material and under the nests.
