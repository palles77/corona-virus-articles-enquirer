            "text": "Adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells (FOXP3 + Tregs) has been developed as a potential curative immune therapy to prevent and treat autoimmune and graft-versus-host diseases (GVHD). A major limitation that has hindered the use of Treg immunotherapy in humans is the difficulty of consistently isolating and obtaining highly purified Tregs after ex vivo expansion. Methods: We isolated bona fide Tregs from expansion cultures based on their selective surface expression of latency-associated peptide (LAP). The TCR V\u03b2 diversity and intracellular cytokine production of Tregs were determined by flow cytometer. The TSDR methylation was determined by epigenetic human FOXP3 qPCR Assay. Their in vitro and in vivo potency was confirmed with suppression assay and humanized xenogeneic GVHD (xGVHD) murine model, respectively. Results: LAP + repurification results in >90% LAP + FOXP3 + Tregs, leaving behind FOXP3 \u2212 and FOXP3 + nonTregs within the LAP \u2212 population. After 4-week expansion, the LAP + Tregs were >1 billion cells, highly suppressive and anergic in vitro, >90% demethylated in the TSDR and able to maintain TCR V\u03b2 diversity. In the xGVHD model, exogenous CD25 \u2212 PBMC administered alone results in a median survival of 32 days. The co-transfer of LAP + Tregs increased median survival to 47 days, while the LAP parent (CD25 + ) and LAP \u2212 nonTregs had median survival of 39 and 31 days, respectively. Conclusions: These preclinical data together provide evidence that LAP + Tregs are highly purified with fully suppressive function for cell therapy. This population results in a more effective and safer product for immunotherapy to treat GVHD and provides the necessary preclinical data for transition into a clinical trial with LAP + Tregs to prevent or treat GVHD and other autoimmune diseases.",

            "text": "FOXP3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subset of CD4 + T cells, maintain immune homeostasis and prevent autoimmunity by suppressing auto-reactivity and regulating immune responses to foreign and self-antigens [1] . A hallmark of Tregs is their expression of the transcription factor, FOXP3, and the high level of CD25, the IL2 receptor alpha chain [2] . Due to their role in maintaining immune homeostasis and tolerance, Tregs have been considered as potentially immunotherapy to prevent a variety of immunological diseases in human. Among potential diseases that may be tackled with such immune-modulators are most graft versus host disease (GVHD), a frequent and often severe complication following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation [3] . Murine studies have demonstrated convincing evidence of the power of Tregs as a cell therapy to prevent and treat various Ivyspring International Publisher immunological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, GVHD, inflammatory bowel disease and lupus [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . In translating these studies to human therapeutic applications, one major limitation is the expansion of Tregs ex vivo to achieve consistently sufficient number and purity of bona fide Tregs. In the peripheral blood of healthy adults, there are ~5-10% FOXP3 + Tregs within total CD4 + T cells. Since FOXP3 is an intracellular transcription factor, only the CD4 + T cells with low CD127 and high CD25 expression, i.e., no more than 2-4% can be sorted to functionally isolate >90% FOXP3 purity. However, this population is not homogeneously Tregs, particularly in diseases where these markers are less correlative due to activated T cells. It has been established that there are two subsets of Tregs: those developed in the thymus (tTregs) and those generated in the periphery (pTregs). Moreover, na\u00efve CD4 + T cells can be induced in vitro with TCR stimulation in the presence of TGF\u03b21 and IL2 to express FOXP3 (iTregs) [11] . The functional patterns for these different subgroups of Tregs are widely varying during the expansion of Tregs over a [3] [4] week period. In addition, the purity and composition of Tregs frequencies with respect to tTregs, iTregs, pTregs and CD4 + FOXP3 \u2212 nonTregs are also varying, resulting in an impure Treg product.",

            "text": "We have demonstrated previously that iTregs lack the cardinal features of tTregs based on anergy and suppressive function [11] . While >90% FOXP3 + cells can be isolated by FACS-sorting, frequently the percentage of FOXP3 + T cells decreases to 75% after two weeks and 50% after three weeks of expansion [12] [13] [14] . Due to these limitations that have hindered the advancement of Treg analysis and therapy, we have developed an innovative technique to repurify Tregs from expanded cultures contaminated with activated nonTregs. By targeting the selective expression of latency-associated peptide (LAP), this novel method allows for expansion and consistent re-purification of sufficient quantity of highly purified, bona fide Tregs (>90% FOXP3), even from an initial limited blood volume of 5-10 ml [15] . Without this technique, it has been difficult to analyze and assess definitively the function of Tregs due to variable contaminants of nonTregs. Moreover, this method has the potential to optimize Treg therapy by permitting the manufacturing of a Treg product that is consistently >90% bona fide Tregs regardless of methods of expansion or donor's variability. Using the LAP marker, we can selectively isolate LAP + Tregs from any time point during expansion that are typically contaminated by >25% FOXP3 + and FOXP3 -nonTregs. This purity and selectivity will allow for separation of different subsets and definitive determination of Tregs function in GVHD. Another important factor is the cost effectiveness for production of a Treg product. In this study, we use CD25 + cells isolated from buffy coats with anti-CD25 microbeads. These CD25 + cells are expanded with OKT3-loaded KT64/86 artificial APC (aAPC) expressing CD86 and CD64 and re-purified based on LAP expression. We perform an analysis of the TCR repertoire, function, and phenotype within CD25 + cells and the subsets of LAP + Tregs and LAP \u2212 nonTregs isolated from expansion cultures. We demonstrate that LAP + Tregs after 4-week ex vivo expansion still maintain diverse TCR V\u03b2 repertoire, are highly demethylated in the TSDR region, and possess suppressive function. In contrast, the LAP \u2212 nonTregs possess no suppressive function, while the CD25 + parent population had variable functionality depending on the level of expanded, contaminated nonTregs.",

This time we use aAPCs, because they are more cost-effective at large scale production and do not require a removal process. Figure 1A shows the expansion and re-isolation protocol. Instead of previously isolating for LAP + Tregs at day 21 (3 rd round of stimulation), this time we isolate LAP + Tregs on the 2 nd round of stimulation at day 12. We choose this approach to reduce the amount of anti-LAP mAbs, since the cell numbers in the cultures are less. With this method, the CD25 + population contains an average of 72% FOXP3 + cells within CD4 + cells (range, 60%-84%), while the percentages of FOXP3 purity post LAP purification (LAP + ) are typically \u226590%. The LAPpopulation still has some FOXP3 + Tregs left. Furthermore, the LAP + cells are mainly GARP + cells ( Figure 1B) . Starting with 4-25\u00d710 6 LAP + Tregs at day 12, we are able to achieve >1 billion LAP + Tregs by day 30 of expansion ( Figure  2A ). The starting CD25 + population at day 0 contains mainly CD4 + FOXP3 + Tregs with the remainder being CD8 + T, CD19 + B and CD16 + NK cells ( Figure 2B and S1). During the expansion, these contaminating non-T cells disappeared by day 10. Furthermore, the CD8 + T cell population is mainly found in the LAPpopulation after repurification ( Figure 2B ). There is a progressive reduction of FOXP3 purity in CD25 + population during the expansion from an average of 60% (range, 36%-74%) at the starting point to a mean of 73% (range, 46%-88%) on day 10 and 52% (range, 21%-87%) on day 30. After LAP repurification, the means of CD4 + FOXP3 + T cells maintain higher than 90% in LAP + Tregs and lower than 40% in LAPpopulation during expansion ( Figure 2C and D) .

The LAP \u2212 nonTregs showed similar median survival (31 days) with PBMC group. The survival of LAP + group was significantly higher than LAP \u2212 group (p < 0.001). Compared with CD25 + group, LAP + Tregs increased median survival from 39 to 47 days. However, no statistic different was found, since some of the CD25 + parent populations have less contaminating nonTregs and therefore higher level of FOXP3 + Tregs ( Figure 2D, 5B) . Average body weight (% of initial weight) for mice surviving on given day for different groups was shown in Figure S3 .",

            "text": "Adoptive transfer of FOXP3 + Tregs to prevent or cure multiple autoimmune diseases or GVHD has proven to be highly efficacious in animal models and human [23] [24] [25] . But a major obstacle to overcome is to achieve a consistent and highly purified FOXP3 + Treg product after ex vivo expansion in a cost-effective manner. In this study, we use LAP as a unique cell surface marker that distinguishes bona fide Tregs from activated FOXP3 + and FOXP3 \u2212 nonTregs and show that it is feasible to sort expanded FOXP3 + Tregs from nonTregs based on expression of LAP. We obtain a post-sort FOXP3 purity of greater than 90% which would be ideal for cellular immunotherapy. Furthermore, we find that ex vivo expanded LAP + Tregs with aAPCs maintain TCR V\u03b2 repertoire diversity, instead of clonal expansion due to selective cell death. Similar data has been detected in expanded cord blood (CB) Tregs: the process of ex vivo expansion did not skew the CB Tregs TCR V\u03b2 repertoire [26] . Although it is possible to obtain a highly purified FOXP3 + population after re-stimulation of the expanded CD25 hi cells, it has also been shown that the effector T cells can transiently possess this feature, particularly after repeated in vitro stimulation [27] . Moreover, several studies have pointed out the potential plasticity of Tregs and caution that this instability could result in the generation of pathogenic memory T cells in vivo [28] . In our study, a quantitative assay to assess the anergic state of Tregs is used to detect the cytokine secretion. Only minimal percentages of IL2, IFN\u03b3, IL17, IL4, IL13 and IL10 are detected in the purified LAP + Tregs as compared to CD25 + and LAP\u203e population. This method offers the opportunity to reduce most of the cytokine secreting cells in our culture compared with rapamycin culture system, which still has >50% of cells secreting IL4 (both FOXP3 + and FOXP3 \u2212 cells) after the fourth re-stimulation [4] . In this study, only minimal percentages of LAP + Treg cells secrete IL-10. While the LAP + cells are mainly GARP + cells, the immunosuppressive role of LAP + might be through GARP/LAP complexes. Glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP), also known as leucine rich repeat containing 32 (LRRC32), plays important role in immunosuppressive function of Tregs by inhibiting T effector cell activity [29] . Targeting GARP by siRNA or monoclonal antibodies specific for GARP inhibit immunosuppressive activity of Treg in vitro and in vivo [30, 31] . However, the role of LAP/GARP on Tregs remains unclear and controversial. Deletion of GARP on mouse Tregs is not sufficient to inhibit the growth of transplanted tumors. They found the suppressive function of Tregs was not affected by knockout of garp in Tregs [32] . Further studies are needed to reveal the mechanisms responsible for suppressive function of LAP + Tregs.",

Therefore, it is crucial to certify that the final Treg products consist of a committed Treg lineage and possess a stable phenotype with the highest purity as possible. A reliable method is the quantification of demethylation in the TSDR, which correlates positively with Treg phenotype and function. This epigenetic marker is highly specific for Tregs and can discriminate them from activated FOXP3 + conventional T cells [34, 35] . When compared with LAP + Tregs, significant levels of FOXP3 TSDR methylation are demonstrated in the LAP \u2212 nonTregs. Even after 30 days expansion, the purified LAP + Tregs are highly demethylated in the TSDR region. Some of the LAP \u2212 populations contain over 40% FOXP3 + cells, yet they have <20% TSDR demethylation, supporting that these FOXP3 + cells are not bona fide Tregs.",

Dr. Lucas group found that the administration of antibody blocking GARP or GARP/TGF-\u03b21 abrogate the protection of Tregs in xGVHD [31] . While we are able to demonstrate the suppressive function of LAP + Tregs, these assays have limitations. Although the LAP + Tregs demonstrate suppressive function by delaying the development of xenogeneic GVHD, we are unable to detect their existence in peripheral blood and spleens of the NSG mice by day 14 post adoptive transfer. Similar to our finding, Parmar et al. have previously shown that ex vivo-expanded cord blood Tregs in NSG xenogeneic model did not persist beyond day 3 [26] . One possible explanation might be due to cytokine deprivation, particularly IL2. Enhancing the stability of LAP + Tregs is critical for the development of an efficacious cell therapy. At this point, we are unclear whether their lack of persistence is intrinsic to the human Tregs or extrinsic due to the absence of critical growth factors compatible with human Tregs in the NSG mice. Further studies are needed to answer these two issues.",

To address this issue, other protocols have implemented rapamycin which has improved the percentage of Tregs, but variability still exists [15, 36] . Consistent with other studies, some of our expanded CD25 + populations maintained >75% FOXP3 + and >60% TSDR demethylation ( Figure 5B ). These CD25 + populations did possess sufficient suppressive function similar to the repurified LAP + Tregs ( Figure 6A, C) . We were unable to demonstrate a statistical difference between CD25 + populations and LAP + Tregs due to the high variability in Treg percentage within some of the CD25 + populations. Therefore, it would be prudent to manufacture highly purified Treg immunotherapy, similar to the standard required for conventional drug manufacturing. Regardless of the variability in bona fide Tregs within the final product, implementing LAP repurification would normalize and produce a highly purified and more homogenous Treg product.",
