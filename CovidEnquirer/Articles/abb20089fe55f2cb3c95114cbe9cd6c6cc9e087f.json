            "text": "Macro domain is a highly conserved protein domain found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Macro domains are also encoded by a set of positivestrand RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal cells, including coronaviruses and alphaviruses. The functions of the macro domain are poorly understood, but it has been suggested to be an ADP-ribose-binding module. We have here characterized three novel human macro domain proteins that were found to reside either in the cytoplasm and nucleus [macro domain protein 2 (MDO2) and ganglioside-induced differentiationassociated protein 2] or in mitochondria [macro domain protein 1 (MDO1)], and compared them with viral macro domains from Semliki Forest virus, hepatitis E virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and with a yeast macro protein, Poa1p. MDO2 specifically bound monomeric ADP-ribose with a high affinity (K d = 0.15 \u03bcM), but did not bind poly(ADPribose) efficiently. MDO2 also hydrolyzed ADP-ribose-1\u2033 phosphate, resembling Poa1p in all these properties. Ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 2 did not show affinity for ADP-ribose or its derivatives, but instead bound poly(A). MDO1 was generally active in these reactions, including poly(A) binding. Individual point mutations in MDO1 abolished monomeric ADP-ribose binding, but not poly(ADP-ribose) binding; in poly(ADP-ribose) binding assays, the monomer did not compete against polymer binding. The viral macro proteins bound poly(ADP-ribose) and poly(A), but had a low affinity for monomeric ADP-ribose. Thus, the viral proteins do not closely resemble any of the human proteins in their biochemical functions. The differential activity profiles of the human proteins implicate them in different cellular pathways, some of which may involve RNA rather than ADP-ribose derivatives.",

            "text": "Macro domain is an evolutionarily conserved protein domain, so named because it is found at the Cterminus of large variant core histones, macroH2A. 1 MacroH2A is found only in vertebrates and sea urchins, but the macro domain itself is of ancient origin, encoded by the genomes of many, but not all, bacteria and archaea. 2 The macro domain of approximately 170 aa folds into a globular mixed \u03b1/\u03b2-fold containing a deep groove, a potential ligand-binding pocket. 3 Recent structural, enzymatic, and binding studies indicate that several macro domains can bind ADP-ribose or its derivates, including poly (ADP-ribose), and that some of them can hydrolyze ADP-ribose-1\u2033 phosphate (ADPR-1\u2033P) to yield ADP-ribose. [4] [5] [6] Therefore, macro domain functions may relate to different ADP-ribose metabolites, although many aspects of their physiological roles remain uncertain. The macro domain protein Poa1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is quite divergent compared to human homologs, and the main function of the yeast protein has been proposed to be the hydrolysis of ADPR-1\u2033P, which is a by-product of tRNA splicing. 7 The human genome contains nine genes encoding macro domain proteins. The two histones macroH2A1 and macroH2A2 have a role in genome silencing, are enriched in female inactive X-chromosomes and other heterochromatin areas, and can also be involved in the regulation of gene expression. [8] [9] [10] [11] The gene for an Snf2-like helicase (ALC1), related to the catalytic subunits of ATPdependent chromatin remodeling complexes, also encodes for a macro domain. 12 Three human genes encode the B-aggressive lymphoma (BAL) family of transcription factors. [13] [14] [15] BAL proteins include two or three tandem macro domains followed by a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) domain, reinforcing the link of the macro family with ADP-ribose derivatives. The final three human macro domain proteins are poorly understood. LRP16 was originally named during the search for leukemia-relapserelated proteins, but was subsequently found by the authors not to have a connection with that process. Therefore, it is here called macro domain protein 1 (MDO1). The expression of the corresponding gene is activated by estradiol, and it may promote the growth of human breast cancer cells. [16] [17] [18] Human locus 140733 encodes a protein [proposed name is macro domain protein 2 (MDO2)] whose macro domain is closely related to that of MDO1. This locus has been linked with a rare developmental disorder, Kabuki syndrome. 19 The gene for gangliosideinduced differentiation-associated protein 2 (GDAP2), which could also be called macro domain protein 3 (MDO3), was described as one of the genes induced by ganglioside synthase expression in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. 20 Macro domains are also encoded by several positive-strand RNA viruses: alphaviruses, rubella virus, hepatitis E virus (HEV), and coronaviruses [including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)]. 1, 21 These viruses replicate their RNA in the cytoplasm of animal cells in membrane-associated replication complexes. 22 The viral macro domains are found in the viral replicase among the more typical replication protein domains, including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase. In alphaviruses, the macro domain is essential for virus viability in cell culture, and the macro-domain-containing nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3) is found at the sites of virus replication, on the outer surface of endosomal/lysosomal membranes. 23, 24 The viral macro proteins are not known to enter the nucleus. The SARS-CoV macro domain has been shown to bind poly(ADP-ribose) and to hydrolyze ADPR-1\u2033P. 6, 25, 26 The viral macro domains have presumably originally been hijacked from the host genome, and certain amino acids in the ADP-ribose binding pocket are highly conserved between viruses and cellular organisms. Thus, the function of viral macro proteins could be similar to the functions of some of the cellular macro domain proteins. Viral macro proteins could act to influence pathways normally regulated by cellular macro domains either to promote virus replication or to inhibit host responses directed against the virus.",

MDO1 and MDO2 do not contain any other predicted domains, although they have significant amino acid stretches attached, respectively, to the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the macro domain. However, a high level of sequence homology between them extends for \u223c 230 aa, although the macro domain comprises only \u223c170 aa of these proteins. GDAP2 includes in its C-terminus a predicted Sec14 domain, which is a putative lipidbinding domain. 27 The viral macro proteins form parts of viral replicase polyproteins. SFV macro domain is located at the N-terminus of nsP3, followed by a unique alphavirus domain of unknown function and, after that, a hypervariable phosphorylated region. 24 In HEV, the macro domain is immediately preceded by a proline-rich region and a putatively unstructured spacer in the replicase protein, and followed by the viral helicase coding region. 28 In coronaviruses, the macro domain is flanked, depending on the virus, by papain-like protease domains or other domains of unknown function that remain in the same mature protein with the macro domain. 29 To study their biochemical properties, we expressed the macro domains derived from MDO1, MDO2, GDAP2, SFV nsP3, and HEV in Escherichia coli as N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged proteins. The previously characterized yeast protein Poa1p 7 was produced as control, and the SARS-CoV macro domain was obtained as previously described. 30 The proteins were purified by metal chelate chromatography, in some cases followed by a second puri-fication step ( Fig. 1c ; see Materials and Methods).

The enzymatic activity of the proteins with ADPR-1\u2033P was measured at room temperature, and the reaction products were detected on thin-layer chromatography (TLC). It was observed that the closely related human proteins MDO1 and MDO2 both hydrolyzed ADPR-1\u2033P equally efficiently as yeast Poa1p (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 7, and 9 ). HEV and SARS-CoV proteins also demonstrated similar activities (lanes 5 and 8). 6 However, SFV nsP3 had only a minor activity, whereas GDAP2 was inactive as an ADPR-1\u2033P phosphoesterase (lanes 6 and 4). The level of activity for SFV nsP3 was independent of the specific construct used, as a protein containing the 167aa-long macro domain region only and an extended protein of 328 aa had similar activities (data not shown). In parallel with TLC, the reaction products from the hydrolysis of ADPR-1\u2033P by MDO1 were analyzed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The mass of the reaction product was 558.1 m/z, confirming its identity as ADP-ribose (calculated monoisotopic mass of the protonated molecule, 559.1) and further demonstrating that the reaction involved the removal of the 1\u2033-phosphate and not another type of modification or degradation of the substrate.",

MDO1 and MDO2 showed the highest affinity for ADP-ribose, with K d values of 0.9 \u03bcM and 0.15 \u03bcM, respectively. The yeast protein Poa1p also had a reasonably high affinity (K d = 2.9 \u03bcM). Viral macro proteins from SARS-CoV and HEV were previously shown to bind ADPribose with a much weaker affinity of \u223c 24 \u03bcM or N 50 \u03bcM, respectively, 6 which was confirmed again in these experiments. We were unable to detect the binding of ADP-ribose to SFV macro. SFV macro domain tended to precipitate in low-salt buffer when the protein concentration was high, as required in calorimetry experiments. Thus, the binding assays for SFV macro protein were repeated in the presence of 500 mM NaCl, where the protein remained soluble. Again, no ADP-ribose binding was detected for SFV macro (both the 167-aa and the 328-aa forms of the protein were tested), whereas MDO1 was able to bind ADP-ribose also in the highsalt buffer, although the dissociation constant measured was approximately twofold higher than that under standard conditions (data not shown). In several independent experiments, human GDAP2 was completely inactive in binding to ADP-ribose ( Fig. 3a) , although it remained soluble under the assay conditions.",

For this assay, poly(ADP-ribose) was produced from radioactively labeled NAD + by auto-ADP-ribosylation of PARP-1 (see Materials and Methods). Macro domain proteins immobilized on a nitrocellulose filter were incubated with a protein-free purified poly(ADP-ribose) preparation or with a preparation in which the labeled polymer was still bound to PARP-1.

Competition of ADP-ribose with poly (ADP-ribose) was also tested in experiments in which the proteins were first preincubated with the monomer, followed by addition of the polymer, with similar results.

MDO2 did not bind poly(A); however, surprisingly, GDAP2, which was inactive in all of the ADP-ribose-related assays, bound poly (A) in this assay, leading to a hypothesis that sequence alterations in the substrate-binding pocket of GDAP2, as compared to other macro domain proteins, might be related to different substrate specificities [nucleic acid binding versus poly(ADPribose) binding].",

The sites for two mutations in both proteins were selected so that by replacing highly conserved glycine residues (which flank the pocket) with a larger amino acid (tyrosine), the narrow binding pocket might become physically blocked (Fig. 4 ). In addition, some of the other conserved amino acids in SFV macro ligand-binding pocket were mutated (Fig. 1a) . The mutant proteins were tested for ADPR-1\u2033P hydrolysis and for binding of ADP-ribose and poly(ADPribose). Several of the single-point mutations were sufficient to inactivate ADP-ribose binding and ADPR-1\u2033P hydrolysis. Mutations G182Y and G270Y in MDO1 inactivated ADP-ribose binding and ADPR-1\u2033P hydrolysis reactions, and the corresponding mutations in SFV macro (G32Y and G112Y) also totally abolished ADPR-1\u2033P hydrolysis ( Table 2 ). The ADP-ribose binding of SFV macro mutants was not tested, as no binding was detected for the wild-type protein. Most macro domains contain a stretch of three glycines (residues 180-182 in MDO1), but SFV macro has an aspartate in the central position (Fig.  1a ). An attempt to return to the consensus sequence by mutation of this aspartate to glycine further reduced the small ADPR-1\u2033P hydrolysis activity of SFV macro, and, for MDO1, an acidic residue (glutamate) was detrimental in this position ( Table  2) . Mutations in the other tested positions of SFV macro abolished the enzymatic activity of the protein ( Table 2) .",

For instance, mutating either of the glycines (G182 and G270 in MDO1) flanking the binding pocket to tyrosine residues totally abolished ADPribose binding, possibly by physically blocking the binding pocket.

In the case of full-length MDO1-EGFP, besides the protein of expected size (62 kDa), an additional smaller protein of \u223c 56 kDa-corresponding to roughly 29 kDa for the MDO1 portion when the mass of EGFP was subtracted-was also detected. Similarly, two bands of \u223c 36 and \u223c 30 kDa were detected when MDO1myc was expressed and detected by anti-MDO1 antibodies (not shown).",

The MDO1 protein sequence was analyzed with the MitoProt program, 31 which predicted export to the mitochondria with a probability of 0.99. The predicted import sequence was 77 aa long, the cleavage of which would result in a mature protein of 248 aa in the mitochondria. To support the presence of a mitochondrial import sequence, we additionally expressed in HeLa cells a construct comprising the last 243 aa of MDO1. Expression in this construct was initiated from the second in-frame methionine and resulted in an evenly distributed cytoplasmic protein (Fig. 5c) , which was sometimes concentrated in large aggregate-like structures at later time points (not shown), and no colocalization with the mitochondria was detected. Therefore, it is likely that MDO1 is initially expressed in the cells as a 325-aa protein, which is transported to the mitochondria and cleaved by mitochondrial enzymes to result in the shorter protein.",

Furthermore, MDO1 was the first macro protein found to localize in mitochondria. We also compared the viral macro domain proteins with their human homologs, expecting that the viral proteins would resemble some of their cellular counterparts and thus putatively influence the same cellular pathways. However, the viral macro proteins from SFV, HEV, and SARS-CoV did not show a clear relatedness to any of the cellular proteins studied, but resembled each other in their biochemical properties.

The high binding affinity of MDO2 for ADP-ribose, its inability to bind poly (ADP-ribose), and its hydrolysis activity towards ADPR-1\u2033P are all properties that it shares with the yeast Poa1p (Table 1 ). If mammalian cells harbor an enzymatic activity scavenging the ADPR-1\u2033P byproduct of tRNA splicing, this role could be fulfilled by MDO2, as previously suggested for Poa1p in yeast. 7 The unusual cytoplasmic splicing event of XBP-1 mRNA during the unfolded protein response caused by endoplasmic reticulum stress may also proceed via a tRNA-like pathway. 32 Interestingly, disruption of the gene encoding MDO2 was suggested to be linked to a rare developmental disorder in one patient, 19 thus implying an important developmental role for this protein. This could be related to ADP-ribose-mediated cellular signaling, as mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation has an important role in the signaling and metabolic pathways of eukaryotic cells (reviewed by Di Girolamo et al. 33 ).

The role of poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation in mitochondrial regulatory events has been under discussion (reviewed by Scovassi 34 ). Recently, two newly discovered poly (ADP-ribose)-hydrolyzing PARG isoforms were detected in the mitochondria. 35 Specific PARG activity was shown to be higher in the mitochondria than in the nucleus, although PARP activity in the mitochondria was low. 35 This could indicate transport of poly(ADP-ribose) from the nucleus to the mitochondria. In another study, nuclear-mitochondrial signaling was studied under apoptotic stress, and no poly(ADP-ribose) transport to the mitochondria was detected. 36 Rather, it was proposed that ADP-ribose might serve as messenger molecule in the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis mechanisms after nuclear poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.

Poly(ADP-ribose) binding, coupled with poly(A)/ nucleic acid binding, further suggests that viral macro domains could have a role in viral RNA replication and/or transcription. The macro domains of HEV and SFV can also bind poly(ADP-ribose) in the presence of a poly(A) competitor. This suggests that they could recruit poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated cellular factors to the replication complex while bound to RNA. It is also possible that the function of poly (ADP-ribose) binding would facilitate the disassembly of macro domain from the viral genome. This possibility could not be tested directly here because poly(ADP-ribose) could not be produced in amounts high enough to be tested in competition experiments against poly(A).

In the same study, the PARP-like domain was also found to have been under positive evolutionary selection, unlike other ZAP domains. 40 Thus, SFV nsP3 and other viral macro proteins could aim to sequester ZAP, or other proteins modified by the putative PARP activity of ZAP, to prevent the normal function of ZAP and the inhibitory event. Also other cytosolic PARP-like proteins or proteins modified by these PARPs could interact with viral macro proteins, but even less is known about these proteins. Altogether, 17 PARP-like proteins, some of which are likely to function in the cytosolic compartment, have been identified in humans. 41 Some of the already characterized PARP proteins have been shown to localize at least partly outside the nucleus, including PARP-3 and PARP-4, tankyrase-1 and tankyrase-2, and probably even PARP-1, the main PARP (reviewed by Vir\u00e1g 42 ). Among the cellular macro domain proteins studied, only MDO1 was able to bind poly(ADP-ribose); however, due to its mitochondrial localization, MDO1 could only indirectly interact with the putative networks influenced by the viral macro proteins.

These results are in accordance with experiments on the histone splicing variant mH2a1.1, which binds O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and ADP-ribose, but not poly (ADP-ribose). 43 The gene mH2A1 results in two differently spliced proteins, of which mH2A1.1 binds ADP-ribose, but mH2A1.2 does not. The reported changes in the mH2A1.2 splicing variant were replacements of G223 and G224 by K and D, respectively, and a \u223c 90\u00b0flip in F348 stacking the adenine residue. 43 In GDAP2, the amino acids corresponding to G223 and G224 in histone mH2A1.1 are also replaced by larger amino acids, K82 and N83. In most macro domains, this region contains a stretch of three glycines (Fig. 1) . We also observed in our experiments that mutating the last of the three glycines (G182 in MDO1) to tyrosine resulted in loss of ADP-ribose binding and ADPR-1\u2033P hydrolysis. It seems that the flexible glycine stretch at the edge of the binding pocket (aa 180-182 in MDO1; Fig. 4 ) is required for ADP-ribose binding. The conservation of this stretch could be one hallmark for the binding of ADP-ribose-type ligands by selected macro domains. In GDAP2, the glycine residue on the opposite side of the binding pocket (G270 in MDO1) has also been lost.",

After 1 h of incubation with [ 32 P]poly(ADP-ribose), the membrane was washed carefully, and bound radioactivity was detected with PhosphorImager. Bovine serum albumin was used as negative control. In addition to the wild-type macro proteins, a double mutant (G182Y + G270Y) of MDO1 and a single mutant (G32Y) of SFV nsP3 are illustrated. (c) Binding of 32 P-labeled poly(A) by macro proteins was tested similarly to the poly (ADP-ribose) binding experiment.",

(a) Western blot analysis of EGFP-tagged proteins, as detected by antibodies against EGFP. An EGFP coding vector without fusion partner was used as positive control (lane 1), and mock-transfected cells were used as negative controls (lane 8). Either the full-length protein (lanes 3, 5, and 7) or the macro domain with flanking sequences (length indicated by the numbers following the name of the protein; lanes 2, 4, and 6) was expressed, as indicated on top. Molecular mass marker is shown on the left. (b) MDO1 fused to a myc epitope was cotransfected with YFP linked to a mitochondrial localization signal (mt-YFP) and detected by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-MDO1 antibodies. Localization of mt-YFP was detected in the green channel, and anti-MDO1 staining was detected in the red channel. Colocalization of the signals is illustrated in yellow. (c) The 243-aa C-terminal of MDO1 detected by anti-MDO1 did not show mitochondrial localization. Full-length MDO2 (d) and GDAP2 (e) were expressed as C-terminally EGFP-tagged recombinant proteins in HeLa cells and were detected by EGFP fluorescence both in the cytosol and in the nucleus.",
