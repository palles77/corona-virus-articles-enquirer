HFL (0.1 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 7 days to 1-day-old and 8-day-old calves, respectively. In both treated groups the drug significantly, and in almost the same manner, decreased the intensity of diarrhoea (P < 0.001) and faecal oocyst count (P < 0.001) when compared to corresponding placebo groups. The only difference between both treated groups was the time of onset of symptoms of the infection. Over time, the clinical pattern of cryptosporidiosis in the animals treated at 8-14 days of age was similar to that seen in the groups receiving the placebo. In contrast, infection in the preventively treated group peaked about 10 days later but with the same intensity. The results of this study confirm the anticryptosporidial activity of HFL in calves, but show that the outcome of infection following preventive treatment is comparable to that observed in calves treated after the onset of symptoms.",

To date, halofuginone-lactate (HFL) seems to be a promising drug against bovine cryptosporidiosis (Villacorta et al., 1991; Naciri et al., 1993; Peeters et al., 1993; Lefay et al., 2001; Joachim et al., 2003; Jarvie et al., 2005) , but although HFL is commonly recommended for both prevention and therapy, its efficacy has not been compared experimentally and recommendations for a rational use are not sufficiently documented. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of a recommended 7 day administration of 0.1 mg/kg HFL for the prevention and treatment of cryptosporidiosis in spontaneously infected calves.",

Faecal scores were obtained daily from all calves between the ages of 1 and 31 days. In order to characterise the overall pattern of the infection, the average score during the 31-day-period (mean faecal score) was calculated for each animal. Similarly, the daily intensity of diarrhoea and the mean intensity of diarrhoea during the 31-day period were calculated. All the data were statistically compared using one-way ANOVA.",

The only difference between both treated groups was a delay in oocyst output and the occurrence of diarrhoea, as infection in the preventively treated group peaked about 10 days later. The benefit of using a preventive treatment with HFL is therefore questionable. On the other hand, postnatal calves are more susceptible to acid-base balance disturbances and dehydration associated with severe diarrhoea. Since this risk decreases with age (Virtala et al., Table 1 Mean faecal score and mean intensity of diarrhoea between 1-31 days of age in calves treated with halofuginone-lactate (HFL) at 1-7 days or 8-14 days of age HFL Values with unlike superscripts differ significantly at P < 0.001. 1996), it may be argued that preventive use of HFL can delay the infection to an age when the animals are more resilient. The minimal differences between the preventive and therapeutic effects of the drug allow practitioners to choose between treatment options according to circumstances.",
