Current vaccines aim to protect against viral agents and a single bacterial agent, Bordetella bronchiseptica. We sought to examine the role of streptococcal species in CIRD. The isolation and identification of streptococci in the lower respiratory tract of clinically healthy dogs and those with CIRD were used to correlate the presence of specific streptococcal species with respiratory disease. In this study we report that the presence of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus is associated with increasing severity of disease in a population of kennelled dogs with endemic CIRD.",

            "text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) is an infection that affects dogs of all ages and commonly occurs when large numbers of dogs are housed together in close confinement. The disease has high morbidity with the dry hacking cough characteristic of laryngitis in the early stages, nasal and/or ocular discharges, and variable anorexia and depression, which can progress to tracheobronchitis, pneumonia and even death in more severe cases. The disease has historically been regarded as a complex infection in which combined or sequential challenge with both viral (canine parainfluenzavirus; CPIV, canine adenovirus; and bacterial agents produces a synergistic enhancement of the clinical signs (Appel and Binn, 1987) . The most common bacterial agent detected during the disease is Bordetella bronchiseptica (McCandlish et al., 1978) , but other bacterial species such as Pasteurella spp., Mycoplasma spp. and \u2424-haemolytic streptococci (\u2424hS) have all been associated with disease (McCandlish et al., 1978; Rosendal, 1978; Thrusfield et al., 1991) .",

However, despite the variety of species of \u2424hS found in the upper respiratory tract of dogs, only a few investigations have focused upon the species of \u2424hS involved in lower airway disease (Garnett et al., 1982; Angus et al., 1997) . Although species of \u2424hS in the canine respiratory tract were noted by Biberstein et al. (1980) this study neglected to distinguish between carriage in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, even though isolation was from veterinary hospital patients the reason for referral and therefore any link to specific clinical conditions was omitted. The most common \u2424hS in dogs, S. canis, a Lancefield Group G Streptococcus, is a normal commensal of the genital and respiratory mucosa as well as skin (Timoney, 1987; Quinn et al., 1999) . Streptococcus canis has previously been isolated from the tonsils of 60-73% of healthy dogs (Smith, 1967; Sadatsune and Moreno, 1975; Biberstein and Hirsh, 1999) . Streptococcus canis causes a variety of sporadic and opportunistic infections in dogs, including pneumonia, septicemia, abscesses, otitis, mastitis, pyometra, proctitis, toxic shock syndrome and necrotising fasciitis (Biberstein and Hirsh, 1999; Quinn et al., 1999) .",

The presence of both canine coronavirus (CRCOV) and B. bronchiseptica has been demonstrated in dogs with CIRD in this centre (Chalker et al., 2003; Erles et al., 2003) . Each week this kennel must sacrifice some dogs for welfare reasons and from these dogs 2-3 were selected arbitrarily for sampling. BAL samples were taken by the following method from a total of 209 individual dogs over a 2-year period from 1999 to 2001. Within 2 h of euthanasia the trachea was clamped just above the bifurcation to prevent any tracheal contamination of the lung during sampling. Using sterile catheter tubing 50 ml Hanks Balanced Salt solution was then placed into the left apical lung lobe. This lung lobe was then massaged manually for 30 s and the BAL withdrawn. At euthanasia dogs were also graded for the severity of clinical respiratory score into the following categories: (1) no respiratory signs, n = 71; (2) mild cough, n = 37;",

Formalin fixed (10% formalin saline) tissue blocks were embedded in paraffin, and standard haemtoxylin and eosin stained sections were viewed under a light microscope (40\u00d7, 100\u00d7, 400\u00d7). The presence or absence of intra-alveolar neutrophils was noted. The total number of days each dog spent in the kennel was recorded and time in the kennel was then calculated in weeks. The age and clinical condition on entry into the kennel of each animal was noted and a clinical condition composite score based on nutritional status, coat, demeanour, appetite and a general clinical examination (temperature, pulse rate, respiration rate) was graded as follows: good (1), poor (2), very poor (3). An additional dog population was included as a control group that comprised of household pet dogs with clinical respiratory symptoms referred to diagnostic bacteriology at the RVC over a 2-year period (1998) (1999) (2000) (n = 71, BAL). Samples from the control group were collected using an endoscopically guided technique as described by Cocoran (1998) . All samples in the study were kept at 4 \u2022 C until bacteriological testing, and testing was performed within 24 h of sampling excepting the calculation of CFU per millilitre that was performed on frozen BAL.",

            "text": "CIRD has historically been considered a complex disease, involving both bacterial and viral agents. Indeed, several agents have been described in this kennelled population of dogs, including CRCOV (Erles et al., 2003) , B. bronchiseptica (Chalker et al., 2003) and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (this study). Although the pathogenic potential of CRCOV has not yet been clarified, data by Erles et al. (2003) shows that CRCOV predominates in those dogs with mild respiratory disease (score 2) and similarly Chalker et al. (2003) found that B. bronchiseptica predominates in those dogs with moderate disease (score 3). Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus is associated more commonly with only the more severe cases of CIRD (scores 4-5) indicating it may act as a secondary invader. Indeed, \u2424hS species have previously been described as secondary invaders in the CIRD 'complex' (McCandlish et al., 1978) . However, it is still not known if S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus plays a primary role in respiratory disease in these animals or merely invades the respiratory tract following damage by other pathogens. Epidemiological evidence suggests that in the horse S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus may be a primary pathogen in respiratory disease (Wood et al., 1993; Chanter, 1997) but it is generally considered to be an opportunistic pathogen (Walker and Timoney, 1998; Anzai et al., 2000) . Even if S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus is not a primary cause of CIRD in these dogs, the high isolation rate from dogs with suppurative bronchopneumonia (87.5%) supports the hypothesis that S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus is responsible for the more severe clinical signs seen in this kennel. The low isolation from household pets (1.4%) with respiratory disease indicates this agent is probably not a common respiratory infection and could be a problem particular to this kennel. Although any previous kennelling was not taken into consideration it is likely that some of the household pet dogs in this study have been kennelled at one time. The role played by S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus in other cases of CIRD in kennelled dogs has not been ascertained.",

A PCR typing system for the gene of the variable M-like SzP protein enables the separation of the 15 known sero-types of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus into five distinct groups, HV1-5 (Walker and Timoney, 1998) . Analyses with this typing system by Anzai et al.

It would be of interest to sub-type the S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus isolates involved in this outbreak of CIRD to determine whether a single clonal variant is present in the diseased population, and also to examine the relationship, if any, that canine S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus isolates have to those causing respiratory disease in horses and other animals.
