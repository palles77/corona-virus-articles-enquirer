Zoonotic spillover from camels appears to play a major role in transmission. Because of logistic difficulties in working with dromedaries in containment, a more manageable animal model would be desirable. We report shedding and transmission of this virus in experimentally infected alpacas (n = 3) or those infected by contact (n = 3). Infectious virus was detected in all infected animals and in 2 of 3 in-contact animals. All alpacas seroconverted and were rechallenged 70 days after the original infection. Experimentally infected animals were protected against reinfection, and those infected by contact were partially protected. Necropsy specimens from immunologically naive animals (n = 3) obtained on day 5 postinfection showed virus in the upper respiratory tract. These data demonstrate efficient virus replication and animal-to-animal transmission and indicate that alpacas might be useful surrogates for camels in laboratory studies.",

This finding also highlights the possibility that widespread vaccination of dromedary camels could result in a major decrease in virus transmission to humans. To date, neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV have not been detected in camelids outside Africa or the Middle East. However, if virus were to be introduced into immunologically naive camelid populations, it probably would be readily transmitted among animals. Many New World camelids are valued for their fiber, and such transmission might devastate fiber-related industries (27) . Thus, as travel-associated cases of MERS-CoV infection continue to be documented, human-to-human virus transmission and possible human-to-animal virus transmission should be monitored.",
