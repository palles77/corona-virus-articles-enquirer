Recent studies have suggested that cell factors involved in autophagy, an evolutionally conserved pathway leading to the lysosomal degradation of protein aggregates and organelles during cellular stress, also have roles in macropinocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy-associated proteins are required for trafficking of EBOV into the cell body. Depleting cells of beclin 1, autophagy-related protein 7, or microtubule-associated protein 1A/B light chain 3B (LC3B) abolished EBOV uptake, owing to a block in vesicle formation at the cell surface. Both LC3B-I and LC3B-II interacted with macropinocytic structures. Our work indicates that, although various forms of LC3B possess an inherent ability to associate with forming macropinosomes, LC3B-II is critical for internalization of macropinocytic vesicles and, therefore, EBOV from the cell surface.",

The virion surface is studded with homotrimeric glycoprotein complexes, which are the sole viral determinant of binding to host cell receptors [2] .

Despite being the earliest reported form of endocytosis, macropinocytosis remains poorly understood, particularly with regard to early steps of macropinosome biogenesis. Formation of macropinosomes depends on phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signaling and actin remodeling, which drive constitutive membrane ruffling. Macropinocytic structures are associated with the Rab effector, Ankfy1, a protein critical for macropinocytosis. Overexpression of Ankfy1 can increase macropinocytosis, whereas knockdown blocks endocytosis, although the molecular mechanism of Ankfy1 function in macropinocytosis remains undetermined [7] .",

Indeed, inhibition of function of several autophagy proteins affected macropinocytosis, demonstrating a close relationship between autophagy and macropinocytosis [9, 10] . Autophagy is a highly conserved, tightly regulated eukaryotic cellular degradation process that, under conditions of cellular stress, sequesters protein aggregates and organelles into large, double-membrane-bound vesicles (ie, autophagosomes) [11, 12] . LC3B posttranslational proteolytic cleavage generates LC3B-I, and subsequent conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine, generates LC3B-II. The processing of LC3B to LC3B-II involves a cascade of multiprotein complexes and results in autophagosome nucleation, expansion, and vesicle fusion [12, 13] . LC3B-II specifically associates with the autophagosome to play a role in these processes [14, 15] . In this study, we investigated the involvement of LC3B and upstream autophagy factors, beclin 1 (Becn1), a member of PI3K complex involved in vesicle nucleation, and autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg7), a component of LC3B lipidation machinery [12] , in EBOV entry into the cell. glycoprotein (GP) clone 4F3 (IBT Bioservices, Gaithersburg, MD), mouse monoclonal to EEA1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and mouse monoclonal to GAPDH and rabbit polyclonal to Ankfy1 (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA).",

Several studies have indicated a role for autophagy proteins in macropinosome trafficking into cells and that macropinocytosis and autophagy pathways are regulated by similar signaling molecules [9, 10, 22] . To investigate whether autophagy-associated proteins generally control macropinocytosis, we measured the impact of Becn1, Atg7, or LC3B depletion on uptake of fluorescently labeled 70 000-kDa dextran, which is taken up exclusively in macropinosomes [23] . One hour after addition, in NT-siRNA treated cells, dextran distribution appeared in numerous vesicles throughout the cytoplasm ( Supplementary  Figures 1 and 2A) . Depletion of LC3B caused nearly complete cessation of dextran uptake, while depletion of Becn1 or Atg7 resulted in a substantial drop in uptake, with the number of dextran-containing vesicles per cell decreasing by >80% (P < .05; Supplementary Figure 2B ). These findings indicate that autophagy-associated proteins are directly required for dextran uptake and therefore have important roles in macropinocytosis and likely EBOV infection.",

Although our data clearly demonstrate a requirement for autophagy proteins in EBOV cell entry, it was unclear which step of virus entry was affected. Virus binding was synchronized by maintaining siR-NA-treated cells at 14\u00b0C, a temperature known to block membrane rearrangements, including endocytic uptake, while not perturbing the cell cytoskeleton [28] . EBOV uptake was then allowed to proceed for various periods by raising the temperature to 37\u00b0C. Cells were subsequently stained with an anti-GP antibody before (to detect cell surface particles) and after permeabilization with nonionic detergent (to stain all particles). The assay has a background of approximately 15% of particles being scored as internalized at time 0. This is due to 14\u00b0C allowing a low level of uptake and incomplete access of antibodies to all particles. Binding to the cell surface was unaffected in cells depleted of Becn1, Atg7, or LC3B, with a subset of particles accumulating at limited sites on the cell periphery (Figure 2A and 2B). In contrast, internalization of virus was significantly abrogated, with comparable numbers of virions remaining on the cell surface throughout the incubation, whereas cells treated with nontargeting siRNA showed a progressive increase in the number of internalized virus particles, with a 3-fold increase after 240 minutes (P < .05; Figure 2A and 2C). Large virus aggregates were also more pronounced in Becn1, Atg7, or LC3B siRNA-treated cells, suggesting accumulation of particles unable to enter cells, but these were not quantified. These results demonstrate that proteins known to associate with the autophagy pathway likely control an early step of EBOV uptake, close to the cell surface.",

Consistent with the essential role of Ankfy1 in macropinosome formation [7] , depletion of Ankfy1 efficiently blocked EBOV infection (P < .05; Figure 3A and 3B). In cells treated with NT siRNA, a progressive association of virus and endogenous Ankfy1 peaked at 60 minutes and then dropped to 50% of the peak level by 240 minutes (Figure 3C and 3D ). This timing is consistent with previous measurements of EBOV uptake into cells [3, 4, 29] . In contrast, twice as many virions associated with Ankfy1, before endocytosis was allowed to proceed, in cells depleted of the autophagy proteins. This finding suggests arrested internalization of Ankfy1 and EBOV. Importantly, after only 10 minutes, the association plateaued, similar to that seen at 60 minutes with the nontargeting siRNA and remained at this level throughout the incubation ( Figure 3C and 3D) , demonstrating that, despite the lack of uptake, virus particles remained associated with macropinosomes at the cell surface. These and previous data (Figure 2A and 2C) indicate that lack of expression of autophagy regulators resulted in aberrant macropinosome trafficking into cells, confirming that the arrest of macropinosome formation and, therefore, EBOV uptake occurred at the cell membrane.",

Because LC3B localization to autophagosomes is necessary for the vesicle formation [14, 15] , we tested LC3B for the ability to localize to and facilitate formation of macropinocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane. Cells overexpressing LC3B fused at its N-terminus to myc tag (myc-LC3B) and Ankfy1 fused to EYFP (EYFP-Ankfy1) were stained with anti-myc antibody. The 2 signals colocalized extensively inside the cell, indicating that LC3B associates with macropinocytic vesicles, consistent with a previous report [8] . Interestingly, a subset of LC3B-Ankfy1 colocalization was also observed close to the plasma membrane ( Figure 4A ). Our observations that LC3B associates with the macropinocytic marker, Ankfy1, and EBOV, which requires macropinocytosis for cell infection, at the cell surface suggest that LC3B may have a role in an early stage of macropinocytosis. However, because both the anti-myc ( Figure 4A ) and the anti-LC3B ( Figure 4B ) antibodies recognized the N-terminal domain of the protein, it was unclear whether the unlipidated form, LC3B-I, and/or the fully processed form, LC3B-II, was required for the association. While LC3B-II, the product of LC3B cleavage and lipidation, specifically associates with autophagosomes [14, 15] , it was unclear whether LC3B processing was also a prerequisite for its association with macropinosomes. To test this, cells treated with NT siRNA or siRNAs targeting Becn1 or Atg7, proteins important for LC3B processing [12] , were transfected with plasmids encoding myc-LC3B and EYFP-Ankfy1. Similar to what was observed in untreated cells ( Figure 4A ), or NT-treated cells, LC3B and Ankfy1 colocalized both inside the cell and at the cell surface ( Figure 4C) . Surprisingly, in cells depleted of either Becn1 or Atg7, LC3B was found exclusively near the cell surface, at the Ankfy1-positive sites ( Figure 4C ). These data indicate that LC3B processing is not required for its association with macropinosomes but instead is required for vesicle internalization from the cell surface.",

To test this, cells treated with the NT siRNA or siRNA targeting Becn1, Atg7, or Atg3 and subsequently transfected with plasmids expressing myc-LC3B and either EYFP-Ankfy1 or EYFP as a control were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation. Atg3 acts downstream of Becn1 and Atg7 and, similar to Atg7, is involved in lipidation of LC3B-I on autophagic membranes [30] . In NT-treated cells, both LC3B-I and LC3B-II coprecipitated with Ankfy1, but in cells depleted of either Becn1, Atg3, or Atg7, only LC3B-I was detected and coprecipitated ( Figure 4D ). These results, together with observations above (Figure 4C ), suggest that, although both LC3B-I and LC3B-II have an inherent ability to associate with Ankfy1 and, therefore, macropinosomes, the lipidated form appears to be indispensable for macropinosome endocytosis and, therefore, EBOV movement into the cell.

            "text": "This study demonstrates a role for host proteins associated with the autophagy pathway in EBOV infection. Our report is first to show that these factors are essential for EBOV internalization following virion binding to the plasma membrane. This dependence is due to a requirement for processed LC3B in macropinosome biogenesis at the cell surface and subsequent trafficking into the cell (Supplementary Figure 4) . Autophagy-regulating proteins or the pathway itself play an important role in the life cycle of numerous viruses by exerting either antiviral or proviral activity. The mechanistic details of the autophagy-virus interaction appear to be extraordinarily complex and are usually unique for each virus [31] . Our results show that, for EBOV, the autophagy pathway is essential to establish infection in host cells. Silencing key pathway regulators significantly blocked infection by the wild-type virus and the pseudotype (Figure 1) , demonstrating that autophagy-associated proteins control an entry step of EBOV. There have been few studies reporting involvement of autophagy proteins in virus entry, and those that do exist provide little information about the mechanism(s), aside from the fact that most likely it involves an intracellular trafficking step [32, 33] . We clearly demonstrate that autophagy regulators control internalization of EBOV from the plasma membrane ( Figure 4) . We also show that virions recruited and colocalized with LC3B-positive structures at the plasma membrane. LC3B strongly associated with EBOV and Ankfy1, a well-established marker of the macropinocytic pathway, not only in the cytoplasm, but also at the cell surface (Figures 3 and 4) . Since the majority of the current literature describes LC3B as being either cytosolic when unprocessed or as associated with intracellular phagocytic or autophagic membranes when lipidated [34, 35] , our observations of LC3B at the cell membrane were somewhat unexpected. Investigation into the origin of autophagosomal membranes identified the plasma membrane as one likely source, where the autophagy regulator Atg16L1 is commonly found [36] . Therefore, it is not unreasonable that basal levels of LC3B can be found at the plasma membrane, presumably in its lipidated form. Our data show that both precursor and processed forms of LC3B strongly interacted with Ankfy1 in both colocalization and immunoprecipitation assays. Since Ankfy1 shows a strong association with macropinosomes throughout the endocytic pathway, LC3B similarly has an affinity for macropinocytic structures, including those at the cell surface ( Figure 4) .",

It will be important to elucidate whether other viruses that have macropinocytosis-dependent infection mechanisms, such as filamentous forms of influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus, similarly depend on autophagy-associated proteins for entry into cells. If, as expected, they do, it may enable the development of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds that interfere with macropinocytosis by inhibiting specific autophagy proteins. Although this approach may influence essential host functions that involve macropinocytosis or autophagy, such as the innate immune response, acute virus infections should only require brief treatments and so could be tolerated. Several specific inhibitors of autophagy proteins, including PI3K and Atg7, have entered preclinical development for potential use in cancer treatment [38] . If such indicators prove to be effective and safe, they could be useful for treatment of infections by macropinocytic-dependent viruses and other pathogens.",

After 24 hours, the treatment was repeated. After another 48 hours, cells were infected with EBOV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Cells were fixed 24 hours later, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. The numbers of nuclei and eGFP-positive foci (ie, infected cells) were counted using CellProfiler software. Relative infection efficiencies for each sample were determined as the ratio of infected cells to nuclei. Mean infection efficiencies (\u00b1SDs) from 3 independent experiments are shown. B, Autophagy pathway regulators do not control EBOV transcription or replication. siRNA-treated 293 cells were transfected with EBOV minigenome RNA encoding the firefly luciferase gene and plasmids encoding the virus genome replication complex proteins nucleoprotein, VP30, VP35, and L. Luciferase activity (expressed in relative light units [RLUs]) was determined 16 hours after minigenome RNA transfection, and value were normalized to values to mock-treated cells and are shown as means (\u00b1SDs) of 3 independent experiments. C and D, Autophagy-associated proteins control EBOV uptake. siR-NA-treated HeLa cells were incubated with virus pseudotypes bearing the EBOV glycoprotein (C) or VSV glycoprotein (D).

A, To determine whether autophagy regulators are required for EBOV cell binding and/or internalization, EBOV virions were allowed to bind to small interfering RNA (siRNA)-treated HeLa cells by incubation at 14\u00b0C for 30 minutes. EBOV-bound cells were then transferred to 37\u00b0C for the indicated times to allow internalization. The samples were subsequently stained with an anti-glycoprotein antibody before (to detect cell surface particles; green) and after (to stain all particles; red) permeabilization with Triton X-100 and with CellMask dye (gray) to define cell boundaries. Yellow staining indicates virus stained by both secondary antibodies, on the outside of cells. Optical Z sections through the middle of the cell body are shown, and scale bars represent 7.5 \u03bcm.
