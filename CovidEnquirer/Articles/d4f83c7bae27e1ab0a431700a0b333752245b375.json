            "text": "The range of changes which occurred in the lymph nodes of the 17 cats reported here match those of hyperplasia and involution described in HIV infection (Racz et al., 1986; Diebold et al., 1988) . The lesions are also comparable with those seen in other lymphadenopathy syndromes occurring in macaques infected with SIV (Letvin el al., 1985) and in cattle infected with bovine immunodeficiency virus (Gonda, Braun, Carter, Kost, Bess, Arthur and van der Maaten, 1987) . Thus it seems likely that the group of lentiviruses associated with immunodeficiency syndromes may cause a distinct pattern of lymph node pathology. There has been a considerable effort to understand the lymph node changes seen in HIV infection; in man, a four-part classification has been proposed (Racz et al., 1986; Diebold et al., 1988) , including follicular hyperplasia, a mixed pattern with both hyperplasia and involuted follicles, and severe follicular involution with lymphoid depletion. These changes are reflected clinically as a progression from lymphadenopathy to lymph node atrophy. These three patterns were seen in the cats in this study. The fourth pattern seen in HIV infection, follicular hyperplasia with hypervascularity, which is associated with cases of Kaposi's sarcoma, was not encountered here although, with lymphoid depletion, the connective tissue and vascular skeleton of lymph nodes appeared prominent in some cases. Human lymphadenopathies are primarily associated with infection of T lymphocytes but they can be associated with B cell hyperplasia accompanied by histiocytic hyperplasia (Diebold et al., 1988) . Both SIV (Chalifoux, Ringler, King, Dehgal, Desrosiers, Daniel and Letvin, 1987) and HIV (Boylston and Francis, 1988) typically infect T lymphocytes and macrophages. The potential importance of different cell-types infected with HIV has recently been discussed (Boylston and Francis, 1988) and the histological changes in HIV and SIV infections have been correlated with the presence of viral antigens (Letvin el al., 1985; Diebold et al., 1988) and alterations in the distribution of different lymphocyte (and other) cell populations (Racz et al., 1986; Chalifoux et al., 1987) . In this study, follicular hyperplasia, alone or as a mixed pattern, was seen in eight cats. Both follicular hyperplasia and dysplasia of the lymph nodes have been reported in kittens which were experimentally infected with FIV (Yamamoto el al., 1988) , and a naturally occurring case of FIV infection showed follicular hyperplasia (Sheton, Abkowitz, Linenberger, Russell and Grant, 1989) . Int~ction with FeLV has also been associated with follicular hyperplasia, possibly reflecting secondary infections (Hardy, 1988) , but the dysplasia seen in FIV infection in this and in experimental studies (Yamamoto et al., 1988) was not a feature of FeLV infection. Lymphoid depletion, in which lymphoid atrophy is most marked in the T cell-dependent paracortical zone of the lymph nodes, and less pronounced in the spleen, has been reported in the FeLV-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in cats (Hardy, 1988) . Although atrophic lymph nodes were found in nine cats in this study, none of the 15 cats in which the FeLV status was known showed evidence of FeLV infection. Generalized lymphadenopathy (Mooney, Patnaik, Hayes and MacEwen, 1987 ) and a distinctive hyperplastic lymphadenopathy (Moore, Emerson, Cotter and DeLellis, 1986) have previously been described in cats. Only some of those cats were infected with FeLV and others may have had a hyperplastic response to FIV infection (Yamamoto et al., 1988) . A feature seen in all the cats in this study was erythrophagocytosis. This feature has been reported in AIDS patients (Racz el al., 1986) and is thought to indicate secondary viral infection (Diebold el al., 1988) . The phenomenon of haematophagic histiocytosis has recently been reviewed (Reiner and Spivak, 1988) . It was a consistent feature in the cats examined in this study, although the precise mechanism is unclear. It is probably not related to the clinical signs of anaemia seen in tbur cats (2, 10, 11 and 14), which was non-regenerative in type (Hopper, personal communication) . Ultrastructural studies to demonstrate FIV particles in lymph nodes from a number of these cats are under way. These studies, together with the use ofimmunohistochemical methods to detect viral proteins, will enable further comparison with HIV.",
