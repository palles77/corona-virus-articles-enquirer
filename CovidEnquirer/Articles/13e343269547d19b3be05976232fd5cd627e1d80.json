Methods: A total of 108 elderly patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection who visited by our hospital between September 2013 and September 2014 were randomly divided into Group A and Group B, with 54 patients in each group. In Group A, levofloxacin injection was given for continuous intravenous infusion treatment, whereas in Group B, levofloxacin injection and levofloxacin capsule were given as sequential therapy (ST). The period of treatment for both the groups was 10 days, and minimum cost analysis was used to analyze the treatment. Results: Groups A and B had cure rates of 61.1% and 59.3% (P\ue02e0.05), effective rates of 88.9% and 83.3% (P\ue02e0.05), bacterial clearance rates of 96.3% and 92.6% (P\ue02e0.05), and incidence rates of adverse reactions of 7.4% and 3.7% (P\ue02e0.05), respectively. Treatment costs of Groups A and B were 1,588 RMB and 1,150 RMB, respectively, whereas the cost-effectiveness of the two groups was at 17.86 and 13.81, respectively (P\ue02c0.05). Conclusion: Levofloxacin ST had relatively higher cost-effectiveness ratio for the treatment of acute lower respiratory tract infection in elderly patients, especially Chinese.",

The former, one of the most common infectious diseases, was referred to acute inflammation from nasal cavity to the throat, and the latter, also a commonly seen infectious disease, could be cured only in the condition that an effective antibiotic is selected based on the identification of the pathogen that has caused the infection. Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) continue to be an important cause of acute illnesses and mortality worldwide (especially in elderly people). 1, 2 The main reasons that cause acute lower respiratory tract infection in the elderly include 3 : 1) decreased immunity due to aging of the body, 2) weakened natural ventilation function and airway scavenging ability due to lower central cough reflex, 3) aspiration pneumonia, 4) mental factors, 5) changes in the climatic environment, and 6) bacterial infections.",

Respiratory syncytial virus, human influenza viruses, human parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2, and 3 (PIV-1, PIV2, and PIV-3), human rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus, and human bocavirus have been identified among patients with ALRI. [4] [5] [6] [7] Over the past decade, the development of successive generations of fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sitafloxacin, sparfloxacin, trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and gemifloxacin has been prompted primarily by the lesser in vitro potency of the original second-generation agents, such as ciprofloxacin, against S. pneumoniae. [8] [9] [10] [11] However, in China, levofloxacin is still the classical drug for ALRI treatment. With the development of pharmacoeconomics and continuously enhanced self-care awareness, antimicrobial therapy -sequential therapy (ST) has started to be applied for clinical use. 12, 13 This study used levofloxacin injection and levofloxacin capsule as the treatment method, analyzed the clinical and economic effects of \"intravenous to oral\" ST for the treatment of lower respiratory tract bacterial infection. [14] [15] [16] This treatment method was compared with continuous intravenous infusion treatment to provide statistical reference for clinical use.",

ST 21, 22 was a type of administration applied during antibiotic treatment of severe infectious diseases that involves parenteral administration (usually intravenous administration) at the early stage and then, after the patients' condition was improved (usually 3-5 days after administration), oral antibiotics were used. In general, it was changed among the same medicine with different formulations, from one level of antibacterial drugs to a lower level, or between the same level. The therapeutic and economic value of antibacterial drugs in ST was gaining more attention. Levofloxacin has been established as one of the leading fluoroquinolone agents during the past 10 years. It was the levo form and active ingredient of ofloxacin. It has the doubled antibacterial activity of ofloxacin, less adverse reaction, and better pharmacokinetic characteristics, gradually replacing ofloxacin. It has shown clinical efficacy in ALRI similar to that of gatifloxacin and is at least as efficacious as the third-generation cephalosporins. 23, 24 Extensive clinical data have confirmed good tolerability of levofloxacin without the phototoxicity or hepatic and cardiac AEs found with some other newer fluoroquinolone drugs. Therefore, levofloxacin ",

However, the pharmacoeconomic cost-benefit analysis showed that the total cost and antimicrobial costs of the ST group were significantly lower than that of the continuous intravenous infusion group. It was also the case with the sensitivity analysis. Patients treated with ST could go home and continue the oral treatment if his/her condition was stable after the change of administration method (oral capsules). This could not only reduce the treatment cost but also lower the probability of complications developed in hospitals. The purpose of ST was to minimize the utilization of resources with the same treatment effect and reduce adverse reactions of the medicine and intravenous medication. Levofloxacin was easy to be absorbed orally with wide distribution in vivo and bioavailability \ue02e90%. 27, 28 Results of this research demonstrated that levofloxacin ST could be applied as an effective method for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infection in the elderly. This treatment method is particularly valuable in countries like China, which has a huge population and insufficient medical resources.",

Nonmedical expenses, which included transportation and accommodation costs, were not included in this article. Indirect costs mainly included patients' salary loss because of hospitalization or medical treatment. Since the period of hospitalization for patients with lower respiratory tract bacterial infection was relatively short, this article only included direct costs. The calculation of total medicine costs was based on the medicine price in our hospital in September 2013. Among them, the cost of l00 mg/piece levofloxacin injection was 26.9 RMB per piece and 100 mg/piece Levofloxacin capsule, which had 12 pieces in each box, was 18.0 RMB\u22c5per box. Therefore, the medicine costs of each group were: C A =26.9\u00d72\u00d710=538 RMB; C B =26.9\u00d72\u00d75+1.5\u00d72\u00d7 5=284 RMB.",
