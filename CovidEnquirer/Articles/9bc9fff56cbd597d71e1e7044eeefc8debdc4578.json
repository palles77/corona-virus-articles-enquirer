The functions of macrophages, critical to both innate and acquired immunity, were compared between the more infectious bronchitis virus-resistant B2 and the more infectious bronchitis virus-susceptible B19 lines. In vivo peripheral blood concentrations of monocytes were similar in B2 or B19 homozygous haplotypes. Peripheral blood-derived macrophages were stimulated with poly I:C, simulating an RNA virus, or IFN\u03b3, a cytokine at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity. Not only did B2-derived peripheral monocytes differentiate into macrophages more readily than the B19 monocytes, but as determined by NO production, macrophages from B2 and B2 on B19 genetic background chicks were also significantly more responsive to either stimulant. In conclusion, the correlation with resistance to illness following viral infection may be directly linked to a more vigorous innate immune response.",

As such, these cells can affect the progression of clinical disease. Innate cellular activity depends solely on the expression of recognition molecules, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) that bind the conserved pathogenassociated molecular patterns of common infectious organisms. The significance of the innate immune function of the macrophage in promoting disease resistance or susceptibility is not well understood. Macrophages are activated or primed upon encountering a pathogen or inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon (IFN) \u03b3 and subsequently undergo functional maturation, increasing expression of Fc-receptors on their cell surface (Dietert et al., 1991; Qureshi, 2003) . Macrophages of various chicken lines congenic for MHC have been shown to differ in their chemotactic activity (Qureshi et al., 1988) and recruitment and activation (Qureshi et al., 1986) . Like mammalian macrophages, avian macrophages produce nitric oxide (NO) upon activation, killing bacteria or protozoa and inhibiting viral replication (Boockvar et al., 1994; Kreil and Eibl, 1996; MacMicking et al., 1997) . Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been shown to differ among chickens of several genotypes, as a result of enhanced transcriptional activity in iNOS hyper-responder genotypes Qureshi, 1997, 1998) .",

Timed exposure (24, 48, and 72 h) of macrophages cultured 6 d to either IFN\u03b3 or poly (I:C) demonstrated the existence of functional differences between B2/B2 and B19/B19 lines of birds aged 5 to 6 wk. Beginning at 24 h postexposure to IFN\u03b3 ( Figure 4A ) and poly (I:C) ( Figure 4B ), induced NO production by macrophages derived from B19/B19 birds was significantly (P < 0.01, t = test, paired) lower compared with that by B2/B2-derived macrophages. Additionally, the responsiveness of B2/B2 cells to either stimulant was significantly greater compared with that of unstimulated control B2/B2 cells (P < 0.01). At 48 h poststimulation with poly (I:C), there was a dramatic difference in the NO concentration of B2/B2 culture (92.76 \u03bcg/mL) supernatants than that of B19/B19 cells (17.90 \u03bcg/mL; Figure 5 ). Because background NO concentration, as well as cell death, increased at 72 h, especially in the B19 cultures, stimulation of cells in subsequent experiments with poly (I:C) ( Figure 5A ) or IFN\u03b3 ( Figure 5B ) was only characterized up to the 48 h time point using age-matched birds ages 6 to 12 wk. In addition, macrophages from B8/B8, B15/B15, and B21/21 haplotypes, as well as macrophages from B2/B2 on B19 background haplotypes (B19bg B2MHC ), were stimulated with IFN\u03b3 (Table 3) . Nitric oxide release from B19bg B2MHC macrophages was very similar (86.2 \u03bcg/mL) to that from B2/B2 haplotypes, and significantly different from NO release of B19/B19 macrophages (P < 0.01). However, stimulation of B8/B8 macrophages was very variable 1 Peripheral blood cell counts (mean cells/\u03bcL \u00b1 SD) performed by Antech Diagnostics (Irvine, CA) for B2/B2 (n = 6) and B19/B19 (n = 6) chickens.

The consistent, significantly greater response of the B2 macrophages could potentially explain the differences observed early after IBV infection. A role of TLR3, which binds to dsRNA, is implicated in the macrophage response and ultimately in in vivo resistance (Malmgaard et al., 2004; Whitmore et al., 2004; Kogut et al., 2005; Nang et al., 2011) . Double-stranded RNA is a replication intermediate during infection with RNA viruses, such as IBV, avian influenza virus, and Newcastle disease virus (Malmgaard et al., 2004; Nang et al., 2011) . Potential functional differences related to macrophage communication with adaptive immunity were evaluated through stimulation by the lymphocyte-derived cytokine, IFN\u03b3. The demonstrated significant differences in NO production that both poly (I:C) and IFN\u03b3 induced in the B2/B2 and the B19/B19 haplotypes may explain, at least in part, the greater resistance of birds of the homozygous B2 line to IBV-associated early onset clinical illness (Banat et al., 2013) . As Dil and Qureshi (2002) showed, expression of iNOS varies among macrophages from chickens of different genetic lines and is associated with differential TLR4 expression in response to lipopolysaccharide. Further research is necessary to analyze iNOS and TLR expression on macrophages from B2 versus B19 haplotypes to investigate if similar pathways are responsible for the difference in activation.",

The B2 and B19bg B2MHC exhibit the largest nitric oxide release compared with other haplotypes. asset in breeding programs. Furthermore, the chicken is an exceptional resource for deciphering MHC-related mechanisms behind disease resistance. Although chickens with various defined B haplotypes have previously been shown to differ in their responses to pathogens, the cellular differences described in these studies provide a basis for future work characterizing the molecular and genetic basis of immune-mediated resistance. These studies provide a background for eventually establishing lines with resistance to infection or with enhanced immunity to vaccines.",
