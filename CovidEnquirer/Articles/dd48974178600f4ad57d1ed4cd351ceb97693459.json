Fragment 450-650 (S450-650) of the S protein contains receptor-binding domain and neutralizing epitopes. In this study, S450-650 was expressed with a histidine tag in Escherichia coli BL21. Bacterial inclusion bodies containing the recombinant S450-650 were solubilized with 8 M urea and then applied onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column. On-column refolding and puriWcation was performed. Reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione were included in the refolding buVer. In the wash and elution buVers, glycerol and glucose were necessary additives to prevent protein aggregation during puriWcation. This refolding and puriWcation procedure allowed production of S450-650 at up to 500 g/ml in soluble form, which maintained appropriate antigenicity and immunogenicity. It was able to induce strong IgG responses in BALB/c mice. In Western blot assays, the recombinant S450-650 was recognized by monoclonal Ab against the His-tag and also sera from a convalescent SARS patient. S450-650-based ELISA system was able to detect anti-SARS-CoV IgG Abs in patient sera. \uf6d9 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus of the Coronaviridae family [1] [2] [3] . The genome of SARS-CoV encodes several structural proteins including the spike (S) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein, and envelope protein [3] . Membrane fusion between SARS-CoV and the host cell is mediated by its S glycoprotein [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , which is also the main target for neutralization Abs against SARS-CoV [5, 8] . The S protein consists of 1255 amino acid residues with approximately 25% homology to those of the other human CoVs [10, 11] . Expression of full-length, or fragments of, S protein in soluble form and relatively large quantity is desirable for study of viral invasion, construction of diagnostic kits, and potential application as subunit vaccines. Computational modeling and sequence analysis indicates that the S protein of SARS-CoV contains 14 disulWde bonds [12] and is highly hydrophobic (446 out of its 1255 amino acid residues are hydrophobic ones). Further studies (EMBOSS: antigenic program) revealed that residues 450-650 of the S glycoprotein (S450-650) of SARS-CoV are largely solvent accessible and contain dominant B cell epitopes. There is also evidence suggesting that fragment 485-625 might contain the receptor-binding domain and also neutralization epitopes [13] . In this study, we expressed histidinetagged recombinant S450-650 in E. coli and puriWed the polypeptide using a rapid on-column refolding procedure.",

After the protein-bound column was precleared with low concentration imidazole (Fig. 3) , a linear gradient of urea in refolding buVer containing glycerol, reduced glutathione (GSH), and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ( Table 1) was applied, with Xow rate held at 1 ml/min. The column was then washed with buVer E containing imidazole at 100 mM, eluting contaminant bacterial proteins but not the target pro- tein (Fig. 3) . Finally, the S450-650 protein was eluted using 800 mM imidazole containing glycerol and glucose ( Table 1 ). The purity of the recombinant S450-650 protein thus obtained was approximately 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3) . Inclusion of glycerol and glucose in the refolding buVer and elute buVers appeared to be crucial, as the yield and the concentration of S450-650 signiWcantly decreased when buVers without glycerol and glucose were used (Fig. 3 , Table 2 ). The puriWcation and yield of S450-650 from E. coli are summarized in Table 2 . The eluted protein was dialyzed in PBS (pH 7.2) containing glycerol (20%) and glucose (5%), and stored at 300 g-500 g/ml at \u00a180\u00b0C.",

This is probably due to the fact that S450-650 contains 64 hydrophobic amino acid residues (31.8% of the sequence). To obtain, reasonably high concentration S450-650 in soluble form, we adopted an oncolumn refolding and puriWcation procedure. -Mercaptoethanol and Triton X-100 were included in the inclusion body wash buVer and lysis buVer (Table 1) , which help to solubilize hydrophobic proteins, reduce interchain disulWde bonds, and minimize non-speciWc binding of proteins to Ni column [16] . Glycerol and glucose were included in the refolding and elution buVers ( Table 1) . As powerful cosolvents, they are able to enhance native protein stability [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . GSH/GSSG (1 mM GSH, 0.1 mM GSSG) were also helpful additives, because of the fact that the oxidizing conditions maintained by GSH/GSSG promote correct formation of disulWde bonds and dramatically increase the recombinant protein yield [20] . Yin et al. [16] showed that Xow rate of the refolding buVer is a factor aVecting protein refolding, whick was maintained at 1 ml/min in our experiments.",

When BALB/c mice were immunized with S450-650, a very strong IgG response was observed (Fig. 6) . In ELISAs and Western blot assays, the S450-650 recombinant protein was recognized by serum Abs from convalescent SARS patients (Figs. 4 and 5) . It is of interest to note that sera from patient PT32 recognized the S450-650 polypeptide in ELISAs but not Western blot assays (Figs. 4 and 5A). It is highly likely that Abs in PT32 serum were speciWc mainly for conformational rather than linear epitope(s) in the S450-650 fragment. In ELISAs, Abs can recognize native (undenatured and non-reduced) Ags, whilst in Western blot assays they can only react with Ags in denatured and reduced form. It can therefore be concluded that a certain proportion of the molecules of our recombinant S450-650 polypeptide refolded correctly following our on-column refolding procedure.",
