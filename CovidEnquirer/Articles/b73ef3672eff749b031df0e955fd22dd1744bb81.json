            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a recently described emerging infectious disease responsible for atypical pneumonia which started in November 2002 in China. By the end of February, clusters of patients were observed in Hong Kong mainly related to close contacts and health-care workers [1] . On March 12th , the WHO initiated a worldwide alert, the disease rapidly spread around the world [2] . Initially a metapneumovirus was isolated from several patients but rapidly a new coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus, was isolated [3] and fulfilled Koch's postulates. Hematological manifestations in SARS were precisely described; lymphopenia and T lymphocytes depletion are often associated with the disease activity [4] . We report the case of a patient with a SARS related-acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the evolution was characterized with two episodes of ARDS associated with a specific cytokine production pattern.",

The patient left Hanoi on March 22nd to travel to Paris. During the travel he developed a shortness of breath and was admitted on March 23rd in the Infectious Diseases Department (Tourcoing, France). On admission, he was febrile (39\u00b0C), presented a tachycardia (100/min), the patient was also hypoxemic (SaO 2 : 88%) with a high respiratory rate (20/min) and rapidly required oxygen supplementation. Chest radiography showed a bilateral opacification with both interstitial and alveolar involvement. The initial treatment associated ceftriaxone and ofloxacin, with ribavirin. The patient remained stable for 6 h before worsening his ventilatory status. He was transferred in the ICU on the 24th, non invasive ventilation was started for 3 h and finally the patient was intubated and sedated. On March 24th, laboratory abnormalities showed a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at 92, elevated levels of aspartate amino-transferase (54 U/l), and white blood cells (15 700 cells/mm 3 ).",

Tracheal samples were still positive for the SARS coronavirus on April 19th, stools started to be positive on 14th April, we therefore cannot rule out a possible exacerbation of the SARS infection related to corticosteroids tapering. The other possibility could be a rebound following corticosteroids withdrawal, in fact, each time the dose reached 10-20 mg/d, clinical status worsened. It seems difficult to decide whether the virus or the decrease of steroids was responsible.",

Produced by T H 2 cells as well as other cells, IL-4 is a growth and differentiation factor for activated B-lymphocytes and activated T-lymphocytes which promotes production of T H 2 cells and IgE by B-lymphocytes. IL-4 enhances macrophage antigen processing and presentation activity and induces other cytokine production. In sepsis, this cytokine increases at the time of diagnosis and is correlated with mortality [7] . In ARDS, Li et al. [8] showed an increase of IL-4 levels to 261 \u00b1 55 \u00b5g/l compared to 43 \u00b1 13 \u00b5g/l in controls, in our study, the levels reached only 13.1 \u00b5g/l but was always produced prior to the clinical deterioration. We systematically sampled the patient each day 8 a.m., the measurement performed on April 19th, which showed an increase of IL-4, was realized on a stable extu- For the other cytokines, our results are consistent with the literature [7, 9, 10] , IL-6 and 10 levels increased rapidly after both of the ARDS in April and March. IL-6 levels reached 1262 \u00b5g/l, a value above 400 \u00b5g/l which has been shown to be associated with a low likelihood of survival [9] .",
