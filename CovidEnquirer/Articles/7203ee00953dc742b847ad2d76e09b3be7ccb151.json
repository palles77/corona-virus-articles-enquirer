In the main olfactory bulb (MOB), infection was observed in periglomerular, tufted, and mitral cells and in interneurons located in the internal plexiform layer. Beyond the MOB, CVS spread into the brain along the olfactory pathways. This infection is specific to chains of functionally related neurons but at the death of the animal some nuclei remain uninfected. CVS also penetrated the trigeminal system. The avirulent mutant AvOl, carrying a mutation in position 333 of the glycoprotein, infected the olfactory epithelium and the trigeminal nerve as efficiently as CVS. During the second cycle of infection, the mutant was able to infect efficiently periglomerular cells in the MOB and neurons of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band, which indicates that maturation of infective particles is not affected in primarily infected neuronal cells. On the other hand, other neuronal cells permissive for CVS, such as mitral cells or the anterior olfactory nucleus, are completely free of infection with the mutant, indicating that restriction is related to the ability of AvOl to penetrate several categories of neurons. From these observations, we concluded that CVS should be able to bind several different receptors to penetrate neurons, while the mutant would be unable to recognize some of them.",

Inoculation of CVS virus in the anterior chamber of the eye results in infection of both the trigeminal and the parasympathetic nerve ganglia and the retinopetal route, whereas AvOl is only able to penetrate into the trigeminal nerve (Kucera et a/., 1985) .

After intramasseter inoculation, avirulent mutant was also found in both motor and sensory nuclei, while CVS was found only in the motor route (Jackson, 1991) . In both cases, the block in the propagation of the avirulent mutant was observed as early as the second cycle of multiplication. This block would be the consequence of either abnormal maturation of the mutant in the neurons or nonrecognition of a specific cellular receptor by the glycoprotein of avirulent mutant. On the contrary, Dietzschold et a/.

            "text": "In order to investigate more precisely the origin of the restricted multiplication of AvOl in the CNS, we decided to follow the propagation of the virus in the olfactory pathways. lntranasal inoculation was used for several reasons. First, rabies virus is able to infect the CNS via the nasal route, since a few examples of airborne transmission of rabies have been described (Winkler, 1975) ; despite increasing interest for this route of infection, the mechanism of viral spread to the CNS has never been carefully examined. In addition, the olfactory system is anatomically well studied with several categories of connected neurons relatively easy to identify. Finally, the receptor cells of the olfactory epithelium are bipolar neurons whose dendrites are in contact with the external environment. Thus, these cells can be directly infected by a virus after it has been dropped in the nasal cavity without preliminary multiplication in nonneural tissues. Neuroreceptor axons terminate in the glomerular layer of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) where they synapse with dendrites of the periglomerular cells, the tufted cells, and the mitral cells (Halasz and Shepherd, 1983) . The axons of neurons of the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) (Switzer et al., 1985) the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB) (Zaborsky et al., 1986) and the dorsal raphe nuclei (DR) (McLean and Shipley, 1987) also terminate in the glomerular layer (Fig. 1) . Since the progression of the infection seems to occur only through synapses it should be possible to follow at least two successive cycles of multiplication after instillation of the virus in the nose. Mice were infected by this route with CVS or AvOl, and the spread of the viruses in the CNS was followed with immunohistochemical techniques. ",

This agrees with the occurrence of a first cycle of infection in the olfactory epithelium before reaching the bulb. At 2 and 2.5 days p.i. only a few cells located in the glomerular layer appeared infected in the ipsilateral MOB (Table 1) . At Day 3, the number of infected periglomerular and/or external tufted cells significatively increased. As these cellular types were difficult to distinguish (Fig. 3A ) they were counted together (Table  1) . A spotted fluorescence was observed in some glomeruli even in the absence of surrounding infected cells, suggesting the presence of viral nucleocapsids in the axonal endings of receptor cells. Mitral cells and large size neurons located in the internal plexiform layer (IPL) also appeared infected (Fig. 3B) . These cellular elements were also counted together ( Table 1 ). The use of the immunoperoxidase method allowed us to estimate that the mitral cells and IPL neurons were equally represented. Few positive medium size neurons were found in the external part of the granular layer. No labeling was noted in the contralateral bulb, except when both fossae were primarily infected. From Day 4 the contralateral MOB became infected. In some animals the number of infected mitral cells could be higher in the contralateral bulb than in the ipsilateral one (Table 1) . At Day 5 nearly all the mitral cells in the contralateral bulb appeared infected (Fig. 3C ). From this time to death it was not possible to count the infected cells because they were too numerous. Nevertheless, very few cells in the granular layer contained viral nucleocapsids (Fig. 3C) .",

Two different situations were observed. (i) The same structures were infected by both strains, even if fewer neurons were often involved for the mutant strain. Nuclei with at least 20% infection compared to the wild type were considered to be in this category. Infection with the mutant could be observed at nearly the same time as for the wild type, like in the orbital cortex and in the amygdala. For most nuclei infected later, the appearance of antigen with the mutant was slightly delayed (up to 1 day). This was the case for the Purkinje cells in the cerebel-lum and the ventromedial thalamic nucleus. (ii) Some structures were infected with the wild type and not, or scarcely, infected with the mutant. This was the case for two nuclei related to the olfactory pathways, the septal area (one of the most heavily infected areas for the wild type) and the raphe nucleus. Another example is the hippocampus which was infected by the wild type as early as Day 4 p.i. [mainly pyramidal cells (Fig.  6 )] and completely invaded by Day 5. With the mutant strain only two of five animals showed a small focus of infected cells in this structure at Day 5. Of three animals sacrificed at Day 6 or 7, two were free of infection in the hippocampus, while the latter showed 10 infected cells. Moreover, in these small infected areas very few pyramidal cells were concerned, most of the infected cells being in the stratum lacunosum molecu- lare.

It is the trigeminal route which is followed by other neurotropic viruses like MHV-JHM (Perlman et a/., 1989) and HSVl (McLean eta/., 1989) . As early as 2 days postinfection viral material was revealed by immunofluorescence in the Gasser ganglion. This result confirms previous ex- periments in which CVS and AvOl viruses had been shown to infect the trigeminal ganglion after intraocular inoculation (Kucera et al., 1985) . It also suggests that trigeminal endings are accessible to the virus without injury of the nasal fossae. Very few infected neurons are detectable 24 hr p.i. in the olfactory epithelium, although the distance between the dendrite endings and the cell body is very short. The increase in the number of infected neuroreceptors observed between Days 1 and 2 cannot be due to a second cycle of infection since infected cells are usually not adjacent. The timing of the first cycle of multiplication in the olfactory epithelium can thus be estimated at 48 hr. This is longer than in cell cultures or in other neurons. For example, after injection in the forelimb of the mouse, viral material can be detected in the spinal cord and the dorsal root ganglia as early as 18 hr p.i. . The longer cycle observed after intranasal exposure could be due to a lower temperature in the nasal cavity compared to that of the body or to a trapping of the virus during the passage across the mucus layer covering the epithelium.",

Rabies virus is different in this respect from VSV, which has been shown to bud at the level of cell bodies of the olfactory receptor cells (Lundh et a/., 1987) and from HSVl, which gives patchy label at least in the olfactory epithelium and the bulb, thus suggesting a transmission from cell body to cell body in addition to the transsynaptic transport (McLean et a/., 1989) .",

These are the periglomerular, tufted, and mitral cells (Halasz and Shepherd, 1983) . Another category of cells which was found to be consistently infected in the IPL anatomically resembles the horizontal cells described by Schneider and Macrides (1978) . But, this latter category is not currently thought to make connections with olfactory neuroreceptors. These neuroanatomical connections identified with rabies virus used as a tracer will be described in more detail elsewhere. Among the nuclei known to project into the glomerular layer, the AON and the HDB are infected by the wild type. All these neurons are secondarily infected with virions produced by the olfactory receptor cells. By comparison, in the MOB, AvOl is only able to infect cells located around the glomeruli, the mitral and the horizontal cells not being infected with the mutant. In the brain, the AvOl mutant is able to infect secondarily the HDB. In contrast the AON is not permissive for the mutant. These results allow us to conclude that AvOl is able to replicate (because AvO 1 -infected neurons are detect-able by immunohistochemistry) and to mature (because of the infection of synaptically connected neurons) in the olfactory epithelium and the trigeminal ganglion. Unlike Dietzschold et al. (1985) we concluded that the spread of the avirulent mutant does not proceed at a slower rate than the spread of CVS but rather implied less categories of neurons.",

            "text": "Why are certain neurons not permissive for AvOl? Either the mutant is unable to replicate normally in these cells or it does not bind to a specific receptor(s) at the synaptic junctions of these cells. The first hypothesis seems unlikely because the mutation of AvOl affects the glycoprotein, and this protein is not known to be involved in the replication of rhabdoviruses (see Wertz et a/., 1987 , for a review). The replication of AvOl could probably take place in any category of neurons normally permissive for CVS provided that the nucleocapsid arrives at the cell body. More probably, the restricted tropism of AvOl is related to the lack of recognition of receptors present at synapses of different groups of neurons. The strong tropism for neuronal cells suggests that viral receptors should be specific to neurons and could be a protein. The suggestion that the acetylcholine receptor could be the receptor for rabies virus has been made on the basis of competitive fixation experiments between rabies virus and a-bungarotoxin on cultured myotubes (Lentz et a/., 1982) and sequence homology between the 189-2 14 region of the rabies glycoprotein and the 30-56 region of the long neurotoxins (Lentz et a/., 1984) . Since AvOl is able to penetrate several categories of neurons, and is restricted for others, the wild type should be able to bind to several different receptors, and thus the acetylcholine receptor cannot be the unique receptor for rabies. Some of our results argue in favor of the acetyl- choline receptor hypothesis: indeed, neurons of the HDB ending in the glomerular layer of MOB are cholinergic (Zgborszky et al., 1986) , and it is likely that the horizontal neurons of the IPL are the cholinoceptive neurons described by Nickel1 and Shipley (1988) . On the contrary, other permissive cells respond to various neurotransmitters: the periglomerular cells to GABA, dopamine, and enkephaline; the tufted cells to glutamate/aspartate, dopamine, and substance P; and the mitral cells to glutamate/aspartate (Halasz and Shepherd, 1983) . Of course it is also possible that other molecules which are not implicated in the binding of neurotransmitters are used by rabies virus as receptors. Interestingly, even during CVS infection, some categories of neurons are not infected by the virus. This is the case for the granular cells in the MOB and the locus coeruleus (LC), a nucleus directly connected to the MOB (Shipley eta/., 1985) . These cells are secondarily (or later) infected in rats instilled with HSVl (McLean et al., 1989) or in mice instilled with VSV (Lundh eta/., 1988) . If, as suggested by Shipley(l985) , the LC is connected to the granular cells in the MOB, it is not surprising that this nucleus was not infected early since granular cells are not permissive for the CVS strain of rabies. Nevertheless the absence of infection of the LC even when the mouse was moribund suggests that these neurons are nonpermissive to the virus. The LC has a noradrenergic projection in the MOB . Another group of neurons responding to noradrenaline, the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), does not seem permissive for the rabies virus. While injection of pseudorabies virus (Herpesvirus) in the anterior chamber of the eye of rats results in infection of the SCG (Dolivo et a/., 1981), the injection of rabies virus at the same site does not result in the infection of this ganglion (Tsiang et a/., 1983; Kucera et al., 1985) .",

Our experiments confirm our previous results that the virus can travel via anterograde as well as retrograde flow. Indeed, during the first cycle of infection the virus is transported in an anterograde fashion in the olfactory epithelium and in the trigeminal nerve. During the second cycle, the virus uses the two types of transport: (i) Anterograde in the mitral and the periglomerular cells in the MOB and (ii) retrograde in the horizontal cells of the MOB and the neurons of the AON and the HDB.",

The death of CVS-infected animals is then probably due to the infection of nuclei which are permissible for CVS but not for avirulent mutants. Such observations reduce the number of potential targets for the lethal effects of the virus.",
