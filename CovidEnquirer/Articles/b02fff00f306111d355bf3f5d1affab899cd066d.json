            "text": "In terms of genome size and genetic complexity, the Coronaviridae are the largest RNA viruses identified so far, rivaled only by the okaviruses, large nidoviruses of invertebrates assigned to the family Roniviridae. Replication has been studied in detail only for coronaviruses, but the limited data available for toro-and bafiniviruses suggest that the latter viruses use essentially similar strategies. Virions attach to dedicated host cell surface receptors via their spikes (Table 1 ) and release their genome into the target cell via fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane and/or the limiting membrane of an endocytic vesicle. The entire replication cycle takes place in the cytoplasm and involves the production of full-length and subgenome-sized (sg) minus-strand RNA intermediates with the viral genome serving both as mRNA for the replicase polyproteins and as a template for minus-strand synthesis. RNA synthesis is catalyzed by an as yet poorly characterized replication-transcription complex, composed of viral and host proteins and associated (at least in coronaviruses) with an interconnected network of modified intracellular membranes and doublemembrane vesicles that are presumably endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived.",

The replicase gene is translated to produce polyprotein pp1a and, subject to programmed \ue0321 ribosomal frameshifting, a C-terminally extended product, pp1ab. The polyproteins are co-and post-translationally processed by a set of virus-encoded proteinases and, thus, are not detectable as full-length proteins in virus-infected cells. The N-termini of pp1a and pp1ab are processed by one or two papain-like proteinases, whereas the C-terminal half of coronavirus pp1a and the ORF1b-encoded part of pp1ab are cleaved at 11 well-conserved sites by the main proteinase (M pro or 3CL pro ), a nidovirus-wide conserved enzyme with a chymotrypsin-like fold, a poliovirus 3C proteinase-like substrate specificity and either a serine (torovirus, bafinivirus) or a cysteine (coronavirus) as active site nucleophile. In coronaviruses, proteolytic processing results in the production of 15 (in viruses belonging to the species Avian coronavirus) or 16 mature products, commonly referred to as non-structural proteins (nsp's) and numbered according to their position -from N-to C-terminus -in the viral polyproteins ( Figure 1 ). Many nsp's are unique enzymes involved in one or more essential step(s) in viral replication. Others appear to be exclusively involved in virus-host interactions (including immune evasion) and are dispensable for virus propagation in vitro (Table 2) . Polyprotein processing in toroand bafiniviruses has not been studied in detail.",

According to the prevailing model for transcription, leader-body fusion occurs during the synthesis of genome-templated sg minus-strand RNAs by 3\ue039-discontinuous extension via a mechanism resembling homology-assisted RNA recombination. This process apparently is driven by sequence complementarity between the anti-TRS at the 3\ue039 end of the nascent minusstrand and the 5\ue039 genomic TRS (Figure 4 ). In support of this model, the production of a 5\ue039-terminal nested set of transcriptionally-active sg minus-strand RNAs with a 3\ue039-terminal anti-leader sequence (in effect a mirror copy set of the mRNAs) has been demonstrated in coronavirus-infected cells. It is believed that each mRNA is transcribed from its corresponding sg minus-strand RNA template via a process of \"continuous\" RNA synthesis.

Transmission is not by biological vectors, but -depending on the virus speciesvia fomites or via aerogenic and/or fecal-oral routes. As CoVs primarily target epithelial cells, they are generally associated with gastrointestinal and respiratory infections that may be acute or become chronic with prolonged shedding of virus. In general, these infections are mild and often asymptomatic. Some coronaviruses, however, cause severe, even lethal disease. Murine coronavirus (genus Betacoronavirus) may cause hepatitis and severe neurologic infection, resulting in paralysis and demyelination, providing a rodent model for the study of the neuropathogenesis of human multiple sclerosis. Some members of the species Alphacoronavirus 1 (feline, canine and ferret coronavirus) cause fatal immune-mediated systemic infections in their respective hosts, presumably through the infection of cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage, with widespread inflammatory lesions in multiple organs. The human coronaviruses that were identified early on (Betacoronavirus-1 subspecies HCoV-OC43 and Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E) mostly cause common colds and have long been considered of modest clinical importance.

Epidemiological evidence indicates that this novel human virus originated in bats, spread to Himalayan palm civets, Chinese ferret badgers and raccoon dogs at the wet markets of Guangdong, China, to enter the human population through handling or consumption of these exotic species. Although SARS has since vanished, the episode does underline the pathogenic potential of coronaviruses and the possibility of novel emerging coronavirus infections arising from cross-species transmissions. Similar incidents, though with a less dramatic outcome, seem to have given rise to human coronavirus OC43 (a single cross-species transmission of bovine coronavirus from cattle to humans), to human coronavirus 229E (transmitted from bats?) and, more recently, to canine respiratory coronavirus (transmission of bovine coronavirus to dogs). In the wake of the SARS epidemic, molecular surveillance and virus discovery studies have yielded evidence for at least 60 novel coronaviruses among which are two new human respiratory coronaviruses, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63. The latter is considered an important cause of (pseudo)croup and bronchiolitis in children. These studies also revealed a new lineage of predominantly avian viruses (Thrush, Bulbul and Munia coronavirus), with possible relatives in mammals (Asian leopard cat, Chinese ferret badger), that on the basis of rooted phylogeny appear to belong to a new genus (Figure 2 ). Bats harbor an exceptionally wide diversity of coronaviruses and have been proposed to play a vital role in coronavirus ecology and evolution, maybe even as the original hosts from which many if not all alpha-and betacoronavirus lineages were derived. Bat population densities and their roosting and migration habits would all favor such a role. Although this hypothesis has its merits and the recent virus discovery studies that prompted this view have been of truly Herculean proportions, it is of note that the actual coronavirus sampling size remains in fact limited and as efforts so far focused mainly on bats, our present perceptions may be biased. Further surveillance studies of similar extent must be performed in other host species (rodents, birds) before final conclusions can be drawn.",

However, in striking contrast to corona-and bafiniviruses, toroviruses employ a mixed transcription strategy and combine discontinuous and continuous RNA synthesis to produce their complement of mRNAs. mRNAs 3, 4 and 5 lack a common leader sequence and are fully co-linear with the viral genome. The genes for M, HE and N, expressed from these RNAs, are each preceded by a conserved 13-14 nt sequence element, conforming to consensus (C)ACN 3-4 CUUUAGA, a copy of which (but without the 5\ue039-terminal C residue) is also found at the extreme 5\ue039 end of the genome. This sequence element is thought to act as a premature termination signal of genome-templated minus-strand synthesis and, in the resulting sg minus-strand RNAs, as a promoter for mRNA synthesis with transcription initiating at the 5\ue039-most adenine residue. The S gene lacks such an internal putative terminator/promoter (TP) element and apparently is expressed via a process similar to, yet distinct from, discontinuous RNA synthesis in coronaviruses. Its mRNA (mRNA 2) is the only sg mRNA species to carry a short 15-18 nt leader identical to the genomic 5\ue039 end (i.e. the genomic TP). A conserved hairpin structure in ORF1b is believed to attenuate minus-strand synthesis to allow a subsequent similarity-assisted template switching event facilitated by sequence complementarity between the 3\ue039 end of the nascent minus strand RNA and residues 16 through 38 of the genome that are located immediately downstream of the 5\ue039-terminal genomic TP copy. This would result in a chimeric sg minus-strand RNA that, because of its acquisition of a complementary copy of the genomic TP, can serve as template to direct 'continuous' synthesis of mRNA 2 ( Figure 9 ).",

Transmission is probably via the oral/ nasal route through contact with contaminated feces or nasopharyngeal secretions. Infected animals shed virus in the feces; in the case of BToV, nasal shedding has also been reported. Toroviruses are likely to cause both acute and chonic infections. Equine and porcine toroviruses are associated with asymptomatic enteric infections and remain viruses in search of a disease. Bovine torovirus, an established respiratory and enteric pathogen of cattle, may cause mild to profuse diarrhoea. The virus, originally designated Breda virus, was first isolated during an outbreak of severe neonatal gastroenteritis with 56.5% morbidity and 8.7% mortality in cattle from dairy farms round the township Breda, Iowa, and duly identified as the etiological agent. In experimentally-infected animals, BToV infects the epithelial cells lining the small and large intestine, with progression from areas of the mid jejunum down to the ileum and colon. Within the small intestine, cells of the upper third of the crypt and the epithelium overlying the Peyer's patches, including M cells, also become infected. Neonatal calves appear to be most susceptible to clinical infection. Maternal antibodies do not prevent infection, but modify the outcome of the disease as colostrum-deprived animals are more prone to develop severe diarrhoea.",

Currently circulating Eurasian BToVs seem to have arisen from a genetic exchange, during which the 3\ue039 end of the HE gene, the N gene, and the 3\ue039 UTR of a Breda virus-like parent were exchanged for those of PToV. Moreover, some PToV and BToV variants carry chimeric HE genes, which apparently resulted from recombination events involving hitherto unknown toroviruses as donors.
