Recent empirical studies have found evidence of a positive link between the bilateral volume of trade and business cycle synchronization (see, for example, Frankel and Rose, 1998; Clark and van Wincoop, 2001; Baxter and Kouparitsas, 2005; Kose and Yi, 2006) . Various theoretical mechanisms have been examined that generate, under certain conditions, a positive link between international trade and international business cycle comovement, including dependence on foreign inputs, common external shocks such as changes in oil prices, aggregate demand shocks, and other aggregate shocks whose cross-country correlation is related to the extent of international trade (see, for example, Backus et al., 1995; Baxter, 1995; Stockman and Tesar, 1995 trade flows and output in the source country relative to non-production-sharing trade flows. The model also produces a positive link between the share of production sharing in total trade and output correlations in manufacturing. This link, however, is lower than the positive link generated by the model between overall trade volumes and output correlations in manufacturing industries, with the extent of the difference depending on how production-sharing trade flows are accounted for in measures of trade flows.",

            "text": "Our work is related to a large literature on business cycles and international trade. It differs from Frankel and Rose (1998) and other empirical work that studies the positive link between the share of trade in GDP and output correlations by focusing on the relation between the production-sharing intensity of trade and output correlations in manufacturing. Yi (2001, 2006) show that in a standard model of international business cycles, trade has a very small effect on overall cross-country GDP correlations given the small shares of trade in GDP for most countries. We focus on manufacturing industries, which have higher trade shares, and show in our model that increasing the share of trade has a bigger impact on GDP correlations in the presence of production-sharing trade. Our work also relates to studies of international business cycles that examine the impact of differing degrees of substitutability in traded intermediate inputs on business cycles (see, for example, BKK, Ambler et al., 2002; Heathcote and Perri, 2002) . 6 Our paper motivates differences in the degree of substitution between inputs based on the extent of production sharing in bilateral trade flows. Other related work that studies macroeconomic models of vertical integration and trade include Yi (2003) , focusing on the increase in trade volumes over time, and Bergin et al. (2007) , focusing on the higher volatility of production-sharing industries in host, relative to source, economies. 7 The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some evidence on the link between the extent of production sharing, trade volumes, and business cycle comovement. Section 3 describes the model. Section 4 examines the model's quantitative implications for the link between the volume of international trade, the extent of production sharing, and international business cycles. Section 5 concludes.",

We examine trade flows between US multinational companies and their affiliates and trade flows between the US and Mexican maquiladoras. Trade flows associated with production sharing are more synchronized with output in the US relative to trade flows that are not associated with production sharing. We then examine the link between the volume of bilateral production-sharing trade flows (as a fraction of output and trade) and bilateral output correlations in manufacturing. We find a positive relationship between the share of production sharing and bilateral manufacturing output correlations. When accounting for this positive link, the intensity of production sharing in trade is at least as important as the total volume of trade in output. 8",

These data provide only an imperfect measure of production sharing as not all trade flows from affiliates to parents have US input or process content and, similarly, some trade flows from the parent to the affiliate are final goods without further content added by the affiliate. 9 Moreover, these data capture only intra-firm trade and omits arms-length productionsharing activities. However, the BEA data have been extensively used in the literature as a way of measuring of production sharing. See, for example, Hanson et al. (2005) and Chen et al. (2005) . 6 Drozd and Nosal (2007) study the trade-comovement relation using an alternative framework based on search and matching frictions. 7 There is also a literature that develops rich models of offshoring and international trade, which abstract from business cycle considerations. See, for example, Antras and Helpman (2004) , Grossman and Helpman (2005) , Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006) , and references therein. 8 More details on the data used in this section can be found in the Appendix and in the notes of the individual tables and charts. 9 This is an important consideration for US-Europe trade, as US-owned affiliates regularly ship final products that are not intensive in US processes or inputs (for example, exports of cars from Sweden or pharmaceuticals from Ireland).",

By 2003, a significant fraction (30-35%) of the sales of affiliates in the NAFTA region are sales back to the US, suggesting that affiliates are part of a vertically integrated production chain, and the goods are ultimately shipped back to the US. In contrast, less than 10% of the sales of European and Japanese affiliates are sales to the US, evidence that the activity of those affiliates is quite different from affiliates in Canada and Mexico. 10 Panel B shows the ratio of exports from US parents to their affiliates as a fraction of the total sales of affiliates. Again, there is an apparent difference between the activities of affiliates in Canada and Mexico relative to Europe and Japan. Exports of intermediate goods to affiliates account for roughly 20-45% of the total sales volume of affiliates in the NAFTA region, but less than 10% of the sales volume for the aggregate of Europe and Japan. This suggests that much more of the production by US affiliates in Europe and Asia is done where the affiliate is located, with less dependence on intermediate inputs from the US parent.",

The figures suggest that the production-sharing intensity of trade is higher within NAFTA (roughly 50% for Canada, 25% for Mexico), than for Japan (roughly 2%) and Europe (roughly 15%). 11;12 This pattern is also documented in Ekholm et al. (2007) , who distinguish export-platform FDI (i.e. affiliate sales to the host or third countries) from vertical integration motivated FDI. 11 Table 1 focuses on production-sharing relationships between US parent firms and their foreign affiliates. European firms engage in similar production-sharing arrangements with their affiliates in Eastern Europe (see Tesar, 2006) . Data based on Austrian and German firms with foreign affiliates in a subset of East European countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) suggest productionsharing figures comparable to those in Table 1 Panel C, ranging from 0.42 to 0.55 for Austria and from 0.15 to 0.65 for Germany. 12 Results in Table 1 are consistent with the information in USITC (various years), which reports the share of domestic content in US imports based on tax-exemption data from Harmonized Tariff Schedule 9802. The coverage of these data has declined recently, with the reduction in tariff barriers lowering the incentive to report domestic content of imports.",

The Maquiladora Program was established in 1965 to help relieve high unemployment in the northern region of Mexico. Foreign-owned firms were granted the right to set up production in the region and to import materials and equipment duty-free under the proviso that the goods would be re-exported. Not all maquiladoras are majority owned by US corporations, so these data complement the information in Table 1 based on US multinational data only. The maquiladoras are an important source of employment and export-oriented growth for Mexico, with their exports accounting for half of all non-oil exports from Mexico and one-third of manufacturing employment. 13 The US is the predominant trading partner with maquiladoras, accounting for roughly 90% of total maquiladora exports in 1998 (Bendesky et al., 2003) . Table 1 shows that including maquiladoras trade significantly increases the measures of production sharing between US and Mexico described above. For example, in Panel C we observe that the production-sharing intensity of trade increases from roughly 25% to 55% when maquiladoras are included. 14 To quantify the operations of maquiladoras, Panel A in Fig. 1 displays the ratio of imports by maquiladoras as a fraction of their exports, for the period 1993-2005. The average value of the ratio is roughly 0:75. This suggests that for every 75 cents of imported intermediate inputs, 25 cents of Mexican value is added to the product, and one dollar is re-exported.",

Panels A and C reveal a positive comovement between the import/export ratio of maquiladoras and the PPI-based RER. For example, the large real depreciation of the Mexican peso in 1995 (an increase in the PPI-based RER) is accompanied by an increase in the import/export ratio. The correlation between the log of the import/export ratio and the PPI-based RER (deviations from a quarterly HP trend) is 0:77.

Frankel and Rose (1998) and Kose and Yi (2006) find a positive relationship between trade flows and bilateral output correlations. We extend their analysis by asking whether production sharing also contributes to the comovement of business cycles. To do this, we examine the link between bilateral output correlations and measures of the share of production sharing in trade and the share of trade in output. Since production sharing is more concentrated in manufacturing industries, we focus on output and trade in manufactured goods. The set of countries includes US trading partners with production-sharing data. The figures we present also include countries engaged in intra-European production sharing based on survey data reported in Marin (2005) . 18 The output correlations between the United States and its trading partners are calculated using annual measures of real manufacturing value added over the period 1983-2005 (the correlations with Eastern-European countries are limited to the period 1995-2003, due to data availability). Fig. 2a shows the relationship between manufacturing bilateral output correlations and the extent of production sharing, here measured as the ratio of current dollar sales of foreign affiliates back to the source country as a share of current dollar manufacturing output in the host country. The figure suggests a positive relationship between bilateral manufacturing output correlations and the ratio of affiliate sales to host country output. 19 Table 3 quantifies this relationship for the US and its trade partners. The second column in Table 3a displays a slope coefficient of 0:94 that is significant at the five percent level. 20 We now investigate whether this relationship is mostly accounted for by the total volume of exports, or by production sharing per se. To do this we decompose affiliate sales from host country j to source country i relative to host country output as follows:",

            "text": "where mftgVA j denotes manufacturing value added in country j, and mftgEXP ij denotes manufacturing exports from country j to i. The first component on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) represents affiliate sales to the source country as a share of manufacturing exports to the source country (in the model, this will be referred to as s P 2 \u00de. Seen earlier in Table 1 , this metric captures the intensity of production-sharing trade in total bilateral trade flows. The second component is the share of manufacturing exports to the source country in host-country manufacturing output (in the model, this will be referred to as s X 2 ). This captures the importance of trade relative to manufacturing economic activity in the host country. This decomposition allows us to separate the effect of production sharing on bilateral output correlations from the effect of the volume of trade. Fig. 2b shows a positive relationship between bilateral manufacturing output correlations and the production-sharing intensity of trade. The corresponding OLS coefficient from Table 3a column 3 is 0:85, significant at the 5% level. Fig. 2c shows the relationship between bilateral correlations and the second term in the decomposition, the volume of trade. The point estimate for the relationship between output correlations and the volume of trade is equal to 0:29, which is lower than the estimate for the affiliate share of manufacturing exports. Table 3b includes both terms of the decomposition in the same regression. The coefficient on the production-sharing intensity of trade is larger than the coefficient on the volume of trade, which is insignificant. The hypothesis that the two coefficients are identical is rejected and the results are robust to the exclusion of outliers. Frankel and Rose (1998) , Kose and Yi (2006) , and others perform a regression similar to that in Table 3a Fig. 2 also includes trade flows between Germany, Austria, and four Eastern-European countries (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia). 19 Given the sensitivity of Mexico-US output correlations to the inclusion of the 1994-1995 Mexican crisis, we report two values for this correlation. One is based on data over the period , and the other is based on data over the period 1996-2003. 20 The results in Table 3 are roughly unchanged if we include intra-Europe pairs of countries, and if we exclude either of the two Mexico observations. Europe are based on correlations between HP-filtered real manufacturing value added from BEA and HP-filtered real manufacturing value added from WDI and OECD for the affiliate host country, over the period 1983-2003. theirs find a positive coefficient on trade volumes, our coefficients are smaller. Our regressions differ in two respects. First, because we are not attempting to identify a causal relationship between openness and business cycles, but rather to describe moments in the data, we do not follow Frankel and Rose (1998) and Kose and Yi (2006) in utilizing instrumental variables to proxy for the bilateral trade relationship. Second, our measures of trade openness differ. While they define the trade openness measure as the ratio of the sum of bilateral exports and imports over the sum of the two countries' GDP for all industries (not solely manufacturing), we measure openness as the ratio of exports from country j to the US over manufacturing GDP (or value added) of country j. Our definition leads to higher ratios (placing total US GDP in the denominator significantly reduces these ratios), and implies smaller regression coefficients on s X 2 relative to those reported in Frankel and Rose (1998) and Kose and Yi (2006) . 21 We conclude this section by summarizing our main findings. First, the degree of production sharing differs significantly across US trading partners. Second, trade flows associated with production sharing are more correlated with US output than trade flows not associated with production sharing. Third, the fraction of exports associated with production sharing is at least as important as the total volume of trade in accounting for a positive synchronization of manufacturing output across countries. Our results are based on imperfect measures of the extent of production sharing at business cycle frequencies. Future work will have to resolve how robust these conclusions are to alternative measures of production sharing. ",

This generates an increase in the supply of both the horizontally differentiated and the vertically integrated composites in country 1. This raises the demand for imports x 12 and v 12 from country 2, as well as the relative price of country 2. This increase in p leads to a lower substitution effect in the vertically integrated composite when zor; so v 12 increases more than x 12 -see (18) and (19). A higher value of s P 2 raises the steady-state level of v 12 relative to x 12 , and leads to a larger increase of z T 2 in response to the aggregate shock. Note that as we increase s P 2 , the positive transmission of the aggregate shock is partly offset by the fact that p rises more (i.e. lower elasticities of substitution lead to larger movements in relative prices), and hence the substitution effects on x 22 and x 12 away from z T 2 are larger. An increase in s P 2 has a similar impact on international business cycle comovements as a reduction in the elasticity of substitution between the home and the foreign good in a standard two-good model such as BKK. For example, if we assume s P 2 \u00bc 0, s X 1 \u00bc 5%, and s X 2 \u00bc 15%, then corr z T falls from 0:21 to 0:06 as we raise the elasticity of substitution 1=\u00f01 \u00c0 r\u00de from 1 10 to 2: In our model, we generate variation in this elasticity of substitution through variation in the importance of production sharing in bilateral trade flows.",

Note that, as discussed under our Result 2, the extent of production sharing shapes the positive link between the volume of trade and bilateral correlations. In the context of our current regression, if we set s P 2 \u00bc 0:05 and vary s X 1 and s X 2 according to the grids defined above, we obtain b s X 2 \u00bc 0:3. In contrast, if we set s P 2 \u00bc 0:9; we obtain b s X 2 \u00bc 0:6. By varying s P 2 between 0:05 and 0:9 we obtain b s X 2 \u00bc 0:43 in our baseline regression.

The lower coefficient on b s X 2 in this case can be understood as follows. If v 11 is included in the measures of exports, then increasing the weight of the vertically integrated composite also increases the share of exports in GDP (even though s X 2 exclusive of v 11 remains constant). This results in more variation in s X 2 , for the same GDP correlations (recall that these do not vary as we change the measurement of exports), which implies a lower coefficient on s X 2 . Note that the positive link between the production-sharing intensity of trade and tradeable GDP correlations b s P 2 is quite insensitive to the inclusion of v 11 in the export measures.",
