Complications from Haemophilus parainfluenzae endocarditis (HE) can be severe, but it is also notable for having a generally favorable prognosis if appropriate treatment is initiated [4] [5] [6] . This remains a challenge because diagnosis can be delayed given the protean manifestations of endocarditis, and the slow-growing characteristics of Haemophilus parainfluenzae. We describe a patient with HE who presented with fever and was found to have coronavirus infection. She was treated symptomatically for viral respiratory infection but was later found to have multiple septic intracranial emboli.",

She exhibited hyperreflexia on examination, but no meningeal signs, papilledema, or focal neurological deficits. Given her coronavirus infection, hyperreflexia, and the development of confusion, computed tomography (CT) of the brain was performed. CT of the brain showed no acute pathology, however there was an incidental finding of a cystic structure extending from the right cerebello-pontine angle to the foramen magnum that precluded obtaining a lumbar puncture. Empiric treatment for meningitisencephalitis with broad-spectrum antimicrobials and antivirals was started, including vancomycin 1 g every 12 h, ceftriaxone 2 g every 12 h, ampicillin 2 g every 4 h, and acyclovir 700 mg every 8 h. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was attempted to better evaluate the cystic lesion and to evaluate for a possible dural venous sinus thrombosis, but the patient developed acute respiratory distress and the study was not completed. Chest radiography demonstrated pulmonary edema and congestion. Trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed normal left ventricular function, normal ejection function, reduced respiratory variation of the inferior vena cava consistent with a volume overloaded state, posterior mitral leaflet prolapse, moderate thickening of the mitral valve leaflets, moderate mitral regurgitation, but no vegetation, as shown in Fig. 1a .",

Intra-operative findings included large friable vegetations on the mitral valve and a thrombous on the posterolateral papillary muscle. Her post-operative course was uncomplicated.

One of its major diagnostic criteria hinges on echocardiographic evidence of an oscillating intracardiac mass or vegetation, an annular abscess, prosthetic valve partial dehiscence, or new valvular regurgitation [9] . Here, the initial TTE demonstrated no vegetation. A recent meta-analysis on the use of echocardiography in detecting vegetations notes that TTE has a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 94%, and as such can fail to show many vegetations that are otherwise identifiable on TEE [10] . Of interest, it has been noted that vegetations are detected in a lower percentage in HACEK endocarditis (71%) in comparison to non-HACEK endocarditis (83%), though there was no difference in the rates of mitral and aortic valve vegetations between the two populations [8] . Because there was a high clinical suspicion for IE given the patient's positive blood cultures and septic intracranial emboli, a TEE was recommended. Given the patient's occupation as a singer and her fear of damaging her vocal cords, she refused TEE and opted for a repeat TTE. A repeat TTE performed 5 days after the initial TTE showed a vegetation that was greater than 1 cm in dimension. This interval increase in size of the vegetation to the point of detectability despite antimicrobial therapy is critical, as it has been shown that this carries an increased risk of complications and the need for surgery [11] .",

These neurologic manifestations include headaches, toxic encephalopathy, meningitis, brain abscess, TIA, embolic stroke, and intracranial hemorrhage. This underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion of IE in patients with HACEK bacteremia with neurological symptoms. Further, it has been shown that HACEK endocarditis has a significant propensity for neurologic complications such as stroke (25%), 56% of which are embolic, and 44% due to intracranial hemorrhage [7] . The presence of neurological complications in turn is associated with a higher morbidity and doubling of median length of stay in hospital [5] . It is significant to note that many patients develop neurologic complications before antimicrobials are started [13] [14] [15] , with as much as 12% of patients developing after initiating antimicrobials, the greatest risk associated with increasing vegetation size and mitral valve involvement [6] . However, the risk of embolic events to the central nervous system declines markedly after 2-3 weeks of initiation of antimicrobial therapy [4, 6] , falling to as low as <1.2 per 1000 patient-days after 2 weeks of therapy, declining further with time [5] . This further highlights the importance of recognizing HE and initiating appropriate antimicrobials, as infection control plays a critical role in preventing embolic events.",
