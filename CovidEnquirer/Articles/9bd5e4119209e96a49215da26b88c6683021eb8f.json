            "text": "In some nation states, sustained integrated global epidemiological surveillance has been weakened as a result of political unrest, disinterest, and a poorly developed infrastructure due to rapidly increasing global inequality. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome has shown vividly the importance of sensitive worldwide surveillance. The Agency for Cooperation in International Health, a Japanese non-governmental organisation, has developed on a voluntary basis a sentinel surveillance system for selected target infectious diseases, covering South America, Africa, and Asia. The system has uncovered unreported infectious diseases of international importance including cholera, plague, and influenza; current trends of acute flaccid paralysis surveillance in polio eradication; and prevalence of HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C in individual areas covered by the sentinels. Despite a limited geographical coverage, the system seems to supplement disease information being obtained by global surveillance. Further development of this sentinel surveillance system would be desirable to contribute to current global surveillance efforts, for which, needless to say, national surveillance and alert system takes principal responsibility.",

            "text": "The role of epidemiological surveillance to identify public-health problems Epidemiological surveillance is a basic tool for discovering the problem of infectious diseases. It can define the behaviour of disease in populations and on this basis the magnitude of the public-health problem can be assessed and an effective strategy can be developed. The importance of epidemiological surveillance was shown vividly during smallpox eradication. The intensified surveillance in west Africa, for example, as well as the Indian subcontinent in the late 1960s and early 1970s, found that fewer than 10% of cases were at that time reported or known to the health services concerned. 1 This discovery resulted in the decision that a mass vaccination campaign without surveillance was ineffective since containment vaccination for the interruption of smallpox transmission had to be guided by effective surveillance activity. Currently in polio eradication, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance has shown the extent of wild poliovirus transmission in areas where intensive immunisation programmes have been instituted. 2 In fact, this strategy has resulted in the stoppage of transmission in the western hemisphere, Europe, and the western Pacific within 10 years from the start of the global programme. Experience, however, has shown that surveillance does not always function as desired, nor does it lead to effective control action. During smallpox and polio eradication, it was recognised that surveillance often has weaknesses, such as poor population awareness, inadequate health facilities, superstition and beliefs that discourage reporting, conscious or unconscious suppression of reporting, and inadequate diagnostic techniques. Even today these weaknesses occur in surveillance activities for many diseases. The recent epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a vivid example. Unreported outbreaks of SARS in the southern coastal areas of China in the autumn of 2002, resulted in worldwide spread in 2003. Monkeypox outbreaks in May, 2003, in the USA are perhaps more appropriately classified in the category of inadequate diagnosis, but showed the international community what could happen in the case of the deliberate release of smallpox virus, whose clinical features closely resemble those of smallpox. 3 These are examples of the weakness of surveillance in the past and present, but surveillance may have worsened since in recent years the power of national authorities has been declining due to political unrest, wars, terrorism, increasing global inequality, and cross-nation movement of people in regions of low income in Africa, Asia, and South America.",

To our regret, we have not pursued the discrepancy due to the informal nature of our system, and aim to improve our handling this problem in future. Influenza and dengue fever were reported in large numbers from a few sentinels. There were very few reports of the disease in the WER over the same period. As the WHO influenza collaborating network indicates, more and more epidemic information, as provided by AGSnet specifically in tropical zones, would be desirable for the rapid discovery of critical epidemics. Increasing reports of dengue fever may be the result of global warming, suggesting that other arbovirus infections like malaria and Japanese encephalitis should receive special attention. Polio and measles are diseases of particular interest in view of the WHO global polio eradication and regional measles elimination programmes. It is unfortunate that WHO missed the initial target year of 2000 in polio eradication. Lingering endemic transmission in seven states in Africa and the Indian subcontinent in 2001-2003 has been alarming-a lesson that intensified eradication efforts together with active surveillance should be short-term campaigns as discussed at the Dahlem Workshop. 7 AGSnet measles reporting reflects the situation of the global measles programme-namely, that despite intensive surveillance, the WHO regional office for the Americas reported no cases for October, 2002, and the indigenous transmission was apparently stopped in 2003. 8 However, overall reporting in other continents is poor, suggesting that many cases are not subject to effective surveillance.

HIV-positivity rates can be compared with reference to the AIDS Epidemic Update, December, 2002 (table 4). 9 Towards the end of 20th century, high positive rates up to 12% were noted in Cameroon, Uganda, Cambodia, and Laos (table 5) . However, as far as limited data from AGSnet is concerned, AIDS prevalence would seem to be in decline in these areas, although it should be borne in mind that blood donors may not be representative of the general population. The positive rates may differ between first-visit donors and repeat donors since the latter will be omitted if they are known to be HIV positive. Hence, lower positive rates may have been reported from the sentinel blood transfusion centres. Since AIDS epidemics cause worldwide concern, these findings require further research.
