When the virus is lymphotropic, understanding the pathogenic process of the viral disease becomes complicated because virus/lymphocyte interactions can alter the cell's integrity and subsequently induce immunodeficiency. The immune system plays an important role in the outcome of acute disease induced by the mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3). The use of attenuated escape mutants provides a tool to study the role of viral properties involved in its pathogenicity. We selected MHV3 mutants by virtue of their resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (mAb), in order to study their pathogenic properties. We reported that two MHV3 escape mutants were attenuated in their pathogenic properties according to inoculation site and with regard to survival time and ability to deplete T-and B-cell subpopulations in the spleen, thymus and bone marrow of susceptible Balb/c mice. The highly attenuated CL12 mutant could not induce depletion in T or B cells following intraperitoneal (i.p.1 or intranasal (i.n.1 inoculations, at three days postinfection. The less attenuated 51.6 mutant, however, maintained the abil*hy to deplete T and B cells following i.p. inoculation, as described with the pathogenic MHV3. In contrast, no depletion of T cells following i.n. inoculation was induced with this mutant, atthough B lineage cells decreased. The use of such mutants enabled us to examine the role of each compartment of the immune system, since the highly attenuated CL12 mutant induced no immunodeficiency, as defined by immune cell depletion, whe reas the less attenuated 51.6 mutant maintained its ability to decrease only the B-cell compartment after i.n. inoculation. Results are discussed with regard to the virus/lymphocyte interactions during the pathogenic process.",

The S protein is central to cellular tropism and MHV virulence. It is responsible for attaching the virus to the cell receptor, so that a point mutation in the S gene could modify viral pathogenicity and its target cells. We selected MHV3 mutants by virtue of their resistance to neutralization by anti-S monoclonal antibodies (mAb), in order to study their pathogenic properties. We show that the pathogenic properties of two MI-IV3 escape mutants were attenuated with regard to survival time (depending on inoculation site) and ability to deplete Tand B-cell subpopulations in the spleen, thymus and bone marrow of susceptible BALb/c mice.",

We have previously worked on the first approach using pathogenic L2MHV3 in resistant A/J or susceptible C57B1/6 mice and have demonstrated a correlation between viral pathogenicity and the depletion of cells in lymphoid organs, resulting from either productive or abortive viral replication (Jolicoeur and Lamontagne, 1989 ; Lamontagne ef al., 1989a; Lamontagne and Jolicceur, 1991) . The use of neutralization escape mutants highlights the role of T-or B-cell depletions in the pathogenic process during acute hepatitis. Pathogenic L2MHV3 induces the depletion of splenic, thymic and bone marrow T-or Blineage cells following both i.p. or i.n. inoculations. Similar decreases in the B-lineage cells were seen in mice infected with the less attenuated MHV3-51.6 mutant, whereas splenic T and thymocyte subpopulations were less affected. The highly attenuated MHV3-CL12 mutant did not induce B-or T-lineage cell depletion, at least before six days p.i. The liver is the main target organ of an MHV3 infection and the privileged site for its replication (Le Prevost ef al., 1975a) . High titres of pathogenic L2-MHV3 occurred rapidly in the liver after i.p. inoculation, whereas MHV3-5 1.6 or MHV3-CL 12 attenuated mutants manifested a delay in the occurrence of viral titres in i.p. or i.n. infected mice. The histopathological examinations revealed some dramatic effects in i.p. pathogenic L2-MHV3-infected mice, particularly in the liver, where main hepatocellular necrosis in the absence of inflammatory cells was evidenced. Lesions were less extensive in i.n. infected mice, with fewer inflammatory cells present. Moderate liver necrosis foci with inflammatory cells, however, were seen in both MHV3-51.6 and MHV3-CL124nfected mice after i.p. or i.n. inoculations (results not shown). The delay in the production of virus titres is thus associated with less extensive histopathological lesions in the liver and with low or no transaminase activity (measuring the level of liver necrosis) found in the serum of such mice, unlike those observed in L2-MHV3infected mice (results not shown). In addition, viral replication was more delayed in MHV3-CL12 mutant after i.n. inoculation. Thus, viral pathogenicity correlates more with the time of appearance of virus tin-es in target organs rather than with the level of viral titres in the liver, brain, lungs or kidneys. Such a correlation has already been observed in resistant A/J or susceptible C57BL/6 mice in spite of scarce lesions in the liver of resistant mice (Lamontagne and Jolicoeur, 1991) . The delay in viral replication may be explained by the inability of the attenuated mutants to replicate in primary target cells or perhaps an ineffici.ent spreading of infection to other organs.",

The change of role of macrophages and lymphoid cells from a barrier to infection to being the host cell targets for viral replication is further strengthened by the fact that genetically determined resistance of A/J mice to i.p. MHV3 infection can be abrogated after intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation (Lamontagne et al., 1989a) . Interestingly, more than 60% of MHV3-CL12infected mice survived up to 10 days p.i. following i.c. inoculation (results not shown) in contrast to those infected with MHV3-5 1.6 or pathogenic L2-MHV3, suggesting that the MHV3-CL12 mutant can be highly attenuated and thus unable to replicate in some unidentified brain target cells. Following i.n. inoculation, MHV strains initially replicate in the nasal epithelium rather than in the macrophages, and then appear in the olfactory pathways within the brain (Barthold and Smith, 1983; Goto er al., 1977) . This way, the virus can persist for more than 20 days in the posterior brain, whereas it is eliminated within 10 days from the nose (Barthold, 1988) . No information is available on the viral persistency mechanism in the brain following i.n. inoculation. ET AL.",

We have previously demonstrated that the major difference between the nonpathogenic YAC-MHV3 virus and pathogenic L2-MHV3 is the inability of YAC-MHV3 to replicate in thymic stromal cells or in B lymphocytes (Jolicceur and Lamontagne, 1989 ; Lamontagne and Jolicczur, 199 1) . Preliminary results indicate that CL12 mutant cannot induce B-cell lysis in vitro in contrast with or L2-MHV3 viruses. A correlation between viral pathogenicity and in vitro viral replication in various target cells has frequently been reported to explain a genetic resistance to the various MHV strains (Boyle et al., 1987 ; Knobler ef al., 1984; Lamontagne et al., 1989b; McNaughton ef al., 1980) . MHV pathogenicity is principally carried by genes coding for the RNA polymerase and the S viral glycoprotein responsible for the attachment of the virus to a cell-surface receptor (Fleming ef al., 1986; Lai er al., 1981; Talbot et al., 1984) . On the other hand, immunodominant sites responsible for the binding of neutralizing antibodies are located on the S glycoprotein, particularly on the S2 subunit. Other domains are also identified near the proteolytic cleavage site and along the globular section of the S 1 subunit (Daniel et al., 1993 ; Routledge ef al., 1991) . In contrast, virus-mediated fusion activity is located at a site different from the neutralization epitopes, as shown by the binding sites of several mAb (Collins et al., 1982 ; Routledge et al., 1991) . MAb used for the selection of attenuated MHV3 mutants were able to neutralize L2-MHV3 at high dilutions and to slightly inhibit cellular fusion, but did not protect sensitive mice against pathogenic L2-MHV3 infection (Martin et al., 1990) , suggesting that these viruses are modified at a site included in a neutralization epitope and located near the fusion site, probably on the S2 portion of the viral glycoprotein (Daniel et al., 1993) .",

Viral pathogenicity is a complex property modulated by the viral tropism for several target cells. On the other hand, the study of viral pathogenicity cannot be dissociated from the immune response mechanisms in the various target organs. Integrity of the immune system is essential for mounting an efficient response and eliminating viral production by the various infected cells. The correlations observed in this work, between the pathogenicity of attenuated CL12 and 51.6 mutants, shed light on the roles of T or B lymphocytes as other target cells for viral replication and the consequences on virus-induced immunodeficiency.",

Effective clearance of viral infection in the brain requires CD4+CD8-and CD4%D8+ lymphocytes and also some unidentified bone marrow cells (Williamson and Stohlman, 1990 ). In addition, as has been demonstrated elsewhere, hepatitis does not result from lytic viral replication in hepatocytes but rather is correlated directly with spontaneous, T-lymphocyte-instructed expression of a procoagulant monokine that exhibits prothrombin-cleaving activity. This observation suggests that MHV3 induces cellular injury through the activation of the coagulation cascade and microcirculation damage (Levy and Abecassis, 1989) . Vigorous procoagulant activity responses were observed in splenic mononuclear cells from susceptible C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice, whereas no activity was detected in cells from resistant A/J mice (Dindzans et al., 1985) . These results indicate that MI-IV3 tropism for macrophages or lymphoid cell subpopulations may alter their production of various cytokines involved in inflammatory responses and in the pathogenic process.",

To verify this hypothesis, we analysed the percentage and absolute numbers of pro-B (14.8 +p.-), pre-B (cp+sp-) and mature B (cp+sp+) in the bone marrow of BALB/c mice i.p. or i.n. infected with L2-MHV3 or MHV3-51.6 or MHV3-CL12 mutant viruses (fig. 5). Percentages of proB cells increased in all infected mice, whereas absolute numbers were not affected in L2MHV3-or 51.6-infected mice. Pro-B cells increased, however, in i.p. or i.n. CLl2-infected mice. Similarly, the percentage of pre-B cells was not strongly affected in all groups of infected mice (fig. 5A). In addition, the percentage of B cells remained at normal levels in i.p. or i.n. infected mice. The percentage of B lineage cells corresponds to the ratio of these cells to other lineage cells in the bone marrow, and reflects not only the variations in B lineage cells, but also in the other haemopoietic compartments. The absolute number, thus, enables us to analyse the B lineage cells independently of modifications occurring in the other bone marrow cell compartments. The absolute number of pre-B cells decreased in mice i.p. or i.n. infected with L2-MHV3 and MHV3-5 1.6 viruses at three days p.i. (P < 0.001) but not in MHV3-CL12-infected (fig. 5B).

The virus dose used did not significantly affect the survival rate of mice or the virus titres in various organs, despite the fact that mice generally died a few hours sooner. The thymuses were strongly depleted after i.p. infection with L2-MHV3 or MHV3-5 1.6, but not during MHV3-CL12 infection. No major differences in the percentages of the thymocyte subpopulations were",
