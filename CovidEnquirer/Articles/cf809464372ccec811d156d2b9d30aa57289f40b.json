As a continued effort, the aim of the present study was to further evaluate the interaction between TPIC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to better understand the cellular entry mechanism. In the present investigation, experiments relevant to co-localization, endocytosis inhibitors and factors influencing the internalization were performed. Without any treatment, there was no co-localization between aminopeptidase N/CD13 (APN/CD13) and caveolin 1 (CAV1). However, co-localization between CD13 and CAV1 was observed when cells were incubated with an anti-CD13 antibody or TPIC. As compared with antibody treatment, TPIC accelerated the speed and enhanced the degree of co-localization. TPIC entered HUVEC not only together with CD13 but also together with CAV1. However, this internalization was not dependent on the enzyme activity of CD13 but could be inhibited by methyl-\u03b2-eyclodextfin (M\u03b2CD), further identifying the involvement of caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CvME). This conclusion was also verified by endocytosis inhibitor experiments.",

            "text": "In recent years, gene therapy and drug targeting studies have revealed the importance of identifying intracellular mechanisms of efficient delivery 1 . Understanding the potential uptake mechanisms involved in the cellular entry of test nanoparticles could be helpful to provide feedback for the rational design of improved vectors 2, 3 . Accordingly, scientists have been aware of the characteristics of typical trafficking pathways for many targeted therapeutics. Endocytosis pathways other than classical clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) have been recently characterized in some details. Such pathways may offer alternative uptake and trafficking pathways for gene delivery vectors 4 . Caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CvME) has been generally considered to be a non-acidic and nondigestive uptake route, which indicates that it does not sense a drop in pH but travels through pH-neutral caveosomes directly to the Golgi and/or endoplasmic reticulum (ER), from which nuclear entry can take place, thereby avoiding lysosomal degradation [5] [6] [7] [8] . CvME is characterized by the evolution of caveolae, which are small, flask-shaped non-clathrin coated invaginations of the hydrophobic membrane subdomains enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids and caveolin protein 9 . The caveolin protein family has three members: caveolin 1 (CAV1), caveolin 2 (CAV2) and caveolin 3 (CAV 3). Among them, CAV1 is the major structural protein in caveolae possessing the ability to interact with numerous proteins [10] [11] [12] . Caveolae in vascular endothelial cells were first identified by Paladern 13 in 1968. Caveolae exist alone or in a cluster on many types of mammalian cells, particularly on epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells 14 . Caveolae can transport bioactive molecules into cells and participate in the reception and transduction of multiple signals 11 . In recent years, the cell physiological function of caveolae has drawn increasing attention, especially in signal transduction, cholesterol transport, cell internalization, tumor suppression and muscle cell synthesis 15 . Additionally, increasing numbers of studies have shown caveolae to be closely related to many diseases, including cancer, arteriosclerosis, muscular dystrophy, early Alzheimer's and diabetes 16 . Because of these characteristics, CvME has attracted tremendous attention in the field of gene delivery research. Among of them, attaching specific ligands to the polymer-based carriers to target CvME has been become a promising approach in gene therapy 5, [17] [18] .",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N/CD13 (APN/CD13) is a type II transmembrane protein present in a wide variety of human organs, tissues and cell types (endothelial, epithelial, fibroblast and leukocyte). CD13 has multiple functions related to tumorigenesis, the immune system, and pain 19 . These functions can facilitate the modulation of bioactive peptide responses, such as pain management and vasopressin release. They can also influence body immune functions and major biological events, such as cell proliferation, secretion, invasion and angiogenesis, thereby providing treatment options for various diseases 20 . CD13 can be specifically recognized and bound by the specific sequence of Asn-Gly-Arg (NGR) peptide and exhibits high affinity and specificity toward this moiety 21 . Although CD13 is a ubiquitous enzyme, studies on its expression pattern in normal and neoplastic human tissues suggest that different CD13 forms are expressed in myeloid cells, epithelia and tumor-associated blood vessels 22 . The CD13 isoform which functions as a vascular receptor for the NGR motif was reported to be selectively overexpressed in tumor vasculature and in some tumor cells 21, 23, 24 . In fact, many CD13-targeted therapy based on NGR, such as NGR-drug conjugates 25, 26 , NGR-coated liposomes (http://www.ambrilia.com), NGR-coated PEG-b-PLA polymeric micelles 27 , NGR-modified PEGylated LPD (liposome-polycation-DNA) nanoparticles 28 , CNGRC/PEG/PEI/DNA vector for gene therapy 29 . and so on, are under clinical and late pre-clinical development. Above all, strategy targeting CD13 by NGR for tumor therapy was widely accepted. Characterization of such newly developed formulations is important in the development of vascular-targeted therapies based on the NGR/CD13 system.",

Currently, an increasing amount of evidence indicates that the temporal and specific localization of these signaling molecules play critical roles in rapid and efficient CD13-mediated signal transduction events 31 . Recently, various compounds or particles have been coupled synthetically to NGR peptide targeting CD13 in an attempt to increase its tumor targeting properties 32 . In our previous studies, NGR peptide was used to modify poly(lactic acid)-poly (ethylene glycol) nanoparticles (PLA-PEG NPs) for targeted gene delivery. It was shown that NGR-modified PLA-PEG NPs (NGR-PLA-PEG NPs) could specifically enhance the in vitro gene transfection efficiency. More importantly, we found that the unique mechanism of CvME was mainly involved in the internalization of NGR-PLA-PEG NPs into HUVEC 33 . Accordingly, we hypothesized that NGR-modified nanocarriers might induce particular signal transduction events via the CD13 receptor and transport them into CD13 positive cells through CvME. However, detailed work to establish their exact cellular uptake mechanisms is currently lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to gain insight on the cellular entry mechanisms in gene transfection.",

In the present study, both CD13-and CAV1-positive HUVEC were selected as test cells, and the previously formulated TPIC was the test nanocarrier. Using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning technology, we presently investigated the co-localization of CD13 and CAV1, the effect of TPIC on this co-localization, the interaction between TPIC and CD13 or TPIC and CAV1, the kinetics of the resulting endocytosis, the effects of endocytosis inhibitors, and factors influencing the internalization of TPIC.",

In the same cells, labelling for CAV1 was observed in green. No co-localization occurred between CD13 and CAV1. After cells bound with the antibodies were incubated for 10 min at 37 1C, the labelling of CD13 and CAV1 on the HUVEC surface showed a uniform punctate distribution, and no co-localization between CD13 and CAV1 was observed. When the incubation time was 30 min at 37 1C, the labelling of CD13 and CAV1 showed in spots, and a small extent of co-localization between CD13 and CAV1 was observed (white arrows). With an extended incubation time at 37 1C, co-localization of CD13 with CAV1 became more frequent after 60 min (white arrows). When the incubation time extended to 2 and 3 h, CD13 and CAV1 gathered into clusters and co-localized extensively (white arrows). These results demonstrated that the antibody against CD13 bound to the cell surface evenly when incubated on ice, but the bound antibodies became sequestered to CAV1-positive patches when the temperature increased to 37 1C. Additionally, the results indicate that binding of anti-CD13 antibody and incubation at 37 1C could cause clustering of CD13 and its co-localization with CAV1. These results are exciting and imply that targeting CD13 could initiate a subsequent interaction with CAV1, although there was no colocalization between CD13 and CAV1 in the absence of antibody against CD13. The accumulation of cross-linked molecules in CAV1positive areas was similar to the previously reported behavior of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins and glycosphingolipids 22, 39, 40 .",

HUVEC were incubated with TPIC using the same procedure with anti-CD13 antibody for 0-4 h at 37 1C. As shown in Fig. 4 , we found the distribution of CD13 on the HUVEC surface was no longer uniform punctuate but was randomly distributed dots at 0 h, which was different with that after treating with antibody. Moreover, when HUVEC were incubated with TPIC and fixed without warming (0 h), the co-localization of CD13 and CAV1 in small clusters had been already observed (Fig. 4 , the top row, white arrows), which was 30 min earlier than that treating with antibody. With the extension of the incubation time at 37 1C, the distribution of CD13 on the HUVEC surface gathered into clusters and extensive co-localization of CD13 and CAV1 occurred at 2 h. However, compared with the colocalization result after anti-CD13 antibody treatment at 2 h, the co-localization result at 2 h after TPIC treatment was much more extensive. These results indicate that TPIC could change the distribution of CD13 in a different manner to antibody, because TPIC could accelerate the speed and enhance the extent of colocalization compared with the anti-CD13 antibody. Additionally, the co-localization also appeared in the cytoplasm, suggesting that after TPIC treatment, CD13 could enter into cell from membrane and co-localize with CAV1 in the cytoplasm for a period of time.",

According to FACS analysis (Fig. 6B) , the amount of internalized TPIC was significantly inhibited by cholesterol depletion (Po0.05). The replenishment of cholesterol by M\u03b2CD-cholesterol did not affect the amount of TPIC internalized because the exogenous cholesterol significantly reversed M\u03b2CD-induced effects 41 .

As shown in Fig. 7 , TPIC uptake was enhanced as the incubation time increased at 37 1C, whereas the internalization of TPIC at 4 1C was inhibited, which demonstrated that endocytic uptake of TPIC was an energy-dependent mechanism. Additionally, surface accessible CD13 was also affected by temperature. At 4 1C, there was approximately less than 10% TPIC internalized, resulting in the decrease in surface accessible CD13. At 37 1C, rapid internalization of TPIC was observed and the uptake of TPIC increased with the incubation time. Interestingly, with TPIC uptake increased, the amount of cell surface CD13 appeared to decrease first and then increase. Over the following 1 h, the internalization of TPIC increased rapidly and reached 53% and there was a sharp decline of surface CD13, which reached the lowest value of 66%. This finding implies that CD13 was involved in the endocytosis process of TPIC. After 1 h, the TPIC endocytosis process continued, but the endocytosis speed reduced because of the lower amount of CD13 on the cell surface. With the increase of the extension of time, the cell CD13 could return to the cell surface through the receptor cycle. With the endocytosis process, the amount of CD13 on the surface was dynamically changed. However, at any time point, the recycled CD13 continued to participate in the uptake process of TPIC so that internalized TPIC gradually increased.",

Hence, HUVEC were treated separately with each inhibitor against different internalization routes including CME, CvME, and macropinocytosis before cell incubation with the TPIC. Chlorpromazine is effective to inhibit CME. Treatment with chlorpromazine (10 \u03bcg/mL) for 30 min resulted in a 67.19% inhibition of TPIC uptake into HUVEC (as shown in Fig. 8 ), which indicated that CME was involved. Although the involvement of CME was previously mentioned 34 , other types of transcellular mechanism were also implicated in the previously reported intracellular traffic experiment of TPIC in HUVEC. Inhibition of the CvME was tested using genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which was reported to inhibit the CvME in some virus 42 . After treated by genistein (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 30 min, the cell uptake of TPIC was significantly decreased by 74.2% (Fig. 8) , suggesting the internalization of TPIC was mainly through CvME. Cytochalasin D was reported to inhibit actin polymerization and membrane ruffling involved in macropinocytosis 43 . The cell uptake of TPIC into HUVEC was reduced by 13.86% (Fig. 8) after cytochalasin D treatment, implying that macropinocytosis was not a major cell uptake mechanism for TPIC under normal condition. Taken together, the endocytic inhibition study presented herein indicated that the internalization of TPIC in HUVEC was a combined process of CME and CvME. The relative ratio between CME and CvME was about 1:1.1. Nevertheless, the unique mechanism of caveolae-mediated endocytosis was indeed mainly involved in the internalization which was consistent with our original hypothesis.",

In the present study, it was verified that there was no colocalization between CD13 and CAV1 without treatment (Fig. 3,   Figure 7 The TPIC uptake and surface accessible CD13 after HUVEC incubated with TPIC at (A) 4 1C or (B) 37 1C at various time points. 0 min). However, when cells were incubated with an anti-CD13 antibody, co-localization between CD13 and CAV1 was observed (Fig. 3, 10 min to 3 h) . These exciting results imply that targeting CD13 could initiate a subsequent interaction with CAV1. When HUVEC were treated with TPIC, a greater degree of colocalization of CD13 and CAV1 was found. It was shown that TPIC could accelerate the speed and enhance the degree of the colocalization of CD13 and CAV1 to a greater degree than anti-CD13 antibody. This difference could be attributed to the differences in the cross-linking degree and size between ligands and antibodies. Compared with antibodies, the NGR-modified nanocarrier was supposed to be a polyvalent ligand for CD13. Therefore, after treating with TPIC, both the speed and the extent of co-localization were enhanced compared with antibody. Notably, although the pattern was less conspicuous, cross-linked CD13 molecules after TPIC treatment showed a streaky distribution along longitudinal lines (Fig. 3, 2h; Fig. 3, 3h) . This phenomenon was probably because the cross-linking of CD13 by TPIC would induce binding to actin filaments, either directly or indirectly, and further cause the longitudinal alignment. This similar distribution was also reported for cross-linked \u03b22-microglobulin 44 and HCoV-229E 45 and both were eventually internalized by the CvME.",

However, TPIC changed the distribution of CD13 on HUVEC, causing CD13 clustering. The cluster of CD13 was possibly because of the accumulation after interacting with NGR on the TPIC surface. This aggregation of receptors was a ubiquitous phenomenon in the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis, which further demonstrated that the The groups in the presence of TPIC but without inhibitor treatment as controls and their fluorescence intensities were expressed as 100%. The decreased fluorescence of other groups compared with control suggested the potential mechanism of internalization. uptake of TPIC in HUVEC was via CD13-mediated active targeting endocytosis. Moreover, CD13 and TPIC were not completely colocalized, and some separately entered the cells, which might be because CD13 needed to separate from the CD13-NGR complex and recycle to the cell surface to be used again. This type of receptor cycle was verified in the following endocytosis kinetic experiments (Fig. 7) .",

Obviously, cholesterol depletion can destroy the integrity of caveolae, affect the interaction between TPIC and CAV1 and inhibit TPIC entry into the cells. The above studies supported the important role of caveolae in TPIC entry into HUVEC. The subsequent inhibition studies also suggested that the internalization of TPIC in HUVEC was a process combining CME and CvME. The existence of CME was inferred through our above and previously reported results. Nevertheless, the dominant intracellular mechanism of TPIC entry into HUVEC was the CvME.
