The optical density produced from a single dilution of test serum was compared with a standard curve and the results were read and printed out from a computer interfaced to a multichannel ELISA reader. The printed results were expressed in ELISA units. The ELISA results obtained on 370 cattle sera were compared with those of the serum neutralisation test (SNT). An agreement of 90.5% was obtained when reciprocal SNT titres equal to or greater than 4 and IgG ELISA units equal to or greater than 50 were taken as indicative of a specific reaction. Of the 370 sera, 35 gave discrepant results of which 21 were SNT positive/lgG ELISA negative and 14 were SNT negative/lgG ELISA positive. When the SNT positive sera negative in the IgG ELISA were tested in an IgM ELISA, 19 were found to be positive. Thus, when the IgG and IgM ELISA results were combined the overall agreement between the ELISA and SNT increased to 957%. The IgG ELISA had a sensitivity of 82.4% and specificity of 94.4% relative to the SNT, whereas the combined IgG and IgM ELISA results gave a sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 94.4% respectively. There was a good positive correlation between the two tests (r = 0.86).",
