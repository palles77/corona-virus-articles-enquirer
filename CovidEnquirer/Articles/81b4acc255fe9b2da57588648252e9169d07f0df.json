Here we describe generation of a recombinant antibody Fc-9E2 comprising a fusion protein between human Fc of IgG1 and a single-chain Fv derived from a hybridoma 9E2 secreting a mAb neutralizing West Nile virus (WNV). Fc-9E2 was shown to retain parental mAb's specificity and WNV-neutralizing capacity. Adenovirus-mediated in vivo delivery of the antibody gene resulted in sustained Fc-9E2 serum levels leading to abrogation of lethal WNV infection in an animal model.",

            "text": "In 1999, West Nile flavivirus was introduced into the Western hemisphere and is considered an important emerging pathogen. While development of vaccines to control WNV and other flavivirus infections continues to attract considerable attention (Pugachev et al., 2003) , even the most efficient flavivirus vaccines would provide a little help in treatment of ongoing infections. Transfer of specific antibodies (Ab) or immunoglobulins has been shown to abort or modify a number of Flavivirus infections (Phillpotts et al., 1987; Roehrig et al., 2001; Schlesinger et al., 1985) . Passive immunization with Abs against WNV can prevent disease in animals infected with WNV (Ben-Nathan et al., 2003; Diamond et al., 2003; Engle and Diamond, 2003) . While therapeutic use of human immune globulin obtained from pooled donor sera collected in regions with the high occurrence of WNV infections has been suggested (Ben-Nathan et al., 2003) , such therapy is not yet widely available. Genetic engineering provides the means to generate recombinant antibodies (recAbs) in vitro by employing eukaryotic expression systems, thus expanding the therapeutic Ab repertoire. Soluble recAbs were demonstrated to bind and effectively neutralize various viral pathogens in vitro and in vivo (Prosniak et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2007) . Effective protection against WNV was achieved after passive transfer of WNV specific recAbs (Gould et al., 2005; Oliphant et al., 2005; Throsby et al., 2006) . However, production of clinical grade antibodies for passive immunization, either natural or engineered, is complicated. Due to high-quality standards applied to clinical grade Ab preparations, the cost of Ab production and/or purification is extremely high (Kasuya et al., 2005) . An attractive alternative to passive inoculation of protective antibodies is in vivo production of therapeutic Abs by gene transfer.",

Although adenovirus (Ad) gene transfer vectors have been used to deliver recAbs for cancer applications (Alvarez et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2006; Yoshio-Hoshino et al., 2007) , studies on the use of Ad vectors for Ab gene delivery are still underrepresented in the treatment of infectious diseases. Kasuya et al. (2005) reported substantial survival advantage from anthrax lethal toxin achieved by an Ad vector-mediated recAb gene transfer (Kasuya et al., 2005) . Recombinant Ads are attractive as delivery vehicles for this application for many reasons. Ad vectors are stable; they can be easily engineered to incorporate large transgenes, their high-titer production and purification can easily be achieved using inexpensive methods. There is an extensive safety record for replication-deficient recombinant Ad in humans (NIH report, 2002) . Transduction efficiency achieved using Ad vectors in vivo is unparalleled among gene delivery vectors, either non-viral or viral. The intrinsic property of replication-incompetent Ad vectors to mediate transient gene transfer looks especially attractive in the context of acute infectious disease treatment with recAbs. The vector is cleared from the organism when the disease is eliminated.",

            "text": "However, as an antibody molecule is a product of two gene expression, special attention should be given to design gene delivery vectors encoding recAbs. It is difficult to achieve balanced expression of two genes with a single vector. Singlechain variable fragment (scFv) is a genetically engineered, single polypeptide molecule that consists of the variable fragments of the heavy chain (VH) and the light chain (VL) of an immunoglobulin joined together by a flexible peptide linker. RecAbs can be engineered to possess new and useful properties by fusion of an scFv to other proteins, including immunoglobulin constant fragments, thereby introducing new therapeutic, physiological and/or biochemical functions. The functional activity of a successful therapeutic Ab is most likely dictated by its entire structural composition, meaning that both the antigen (Ag)binding and the effector portions of a recombinant antibody should be preserved. Recently, Lo et al. described an approach that permits high level production of recombinant proteins in eukaryotic expression systems, whereby the protein of interest is produced as a carboxy-terminal fusion protein with an immunoglobulin constant fragment (fragment crystallizable, Fc) (Lo et al., 1998) . By swapping the Fc portions of recAbs it is possible to tailor their effector functions. We further developed this approach by designing and producing a recombinant antibody molecule, that includes an scFv as the C-terminal fusion with the IgG Fc fragment. It has been demonstrated that the recombinant antibody in this configuration retains its binding properties (Korokhov et al., 2003) .",

To achieve that we have generated a recombinant Ad vector encoding secreted recAb Fc-9E2 using the genetic material from a hybridoma cell line secreting monoclonal antibody 9E2 (Fig. 1a) This mAb displayed a strong neutralizing activity against different strains of WNV (Razumov et al., 2005) . Coding DNA of the VH and VL portions of mAb 9E2 were PCR-amplified and cloned to encode scFv 9E2 (Fig. 1b) . The Fc-9E2 (Fig. 1c) expression cassette was then generated that included a gene of secreted Fc-9E2 (the mouse Ig kappa leader peptide followed by human IgG1 Fc and scFv 9E2 ORF) upstream of the SV40 polyadenylation signal. The entire cassette controlled by the CMV promoter was incorporated into an Ad vector. The resulting recombinant virus Ad/Fc-9E2 (Fig. 1d ) was used in this study for both in vitro protein production and for in vivo recAb gene delivery (Fig. 1e) . We anticipated that after inoculation of animals with Ad/Fc-9E2 sustained levels of WNV-neutralizing recAbs in blood will confer protection against otherwise lethal WNV infection. Sequences of scFv 9E2 VH and VL were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers EF571851 and EF571852, respectively. Fig. 1 . Schematic outline of the study. Genetic material form a hybridoma secreting the WNV-neutralizing mAb 9E2 (a) was used to generate scFv 9E2 (b) and then Fc-9E2 (c) coding sequences. Expression cassette comprising Fc-9E2 ORF, preceded by mouse kappa chain leader peptide sequence and followed by a polyadenylation signal, placed under the control of the CMV promoter was introduced into an Ad genome, which was further used to generate recombinant Ad/Fc-9E2 (d). The vector was used to inoculate mice (e) achieving Fc-9E2 in vivo production resulting in WNV neutralization and animal protection. ScFv 9E2 produced in bacteria and purified from periplasmic extract was shown to recognize purified C-terminal fragment of WNV E protein-WNVEC in ELISA (data not shown). Fc-9E2 produced in vitro was purified from the culture supernatant of Ad/Fc-9E2-transduced A549 cells using protein A chromatography. The yield of Ad-mediated recAb production was \u223c5 mg/L.

Unreduced Fc-9E2 (no ME, no boiling) migrated as a \u223c110 kDa band (right lane), which corresponds to the dimeric form of the recAb. Purified Fig. 2 . Characterization of Fc-9E2. (a) Western blot of purified Fc-9E2. A549 cells were transduced with the Ad/Fc-9E2. The recAb was protein A-purified from culture supernatant. Aliquots of the purified recAb were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG Abs and DAB staining. (R) Sample in reducing (2-ME, boiling) conditions; (UR) sample in unreducing (no 2-ME, no boiling) conditions. (b) Indirect ELISA with WNV-infected cell lysate. Anti WNV mAb 5H6 (squares) or an irrelevant mAb (diamonds) were used as capturing Abs. The wells were incubated with WNV-infected (Eg-101) Vero cell lysate followed by Fc-9E2, anti-human IgG/HRP and DAB staining. (c) Radioimmunoprecipitation with the lysate of BHK cells transfected with WN956 infectious clone. Cell lysate was incubated with Fc-9E2 (lane 1) and WNV E protein-specific mAb E31 (lane 2) followed by precipitation with protein A agarose. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and visualized on X-ray film. (d) Fc-9E2 ELISA with WNVEC. Fc-9E2 was incubated with either WNVEC (squares) or casein (diamonds) followed by HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG Abs and DAB staining. Fc-9E2 was demonstrated to specifically bind WNV virions (strain Eg101) in indirect ELISA (Fig. 2b) . Purified Fc-9E2 specifically immunoprecipitated WNV E protein from lysates of WNV infected radiolabeled BHK cells (Fig. 2c) . It was shown previously (Razumov et al., 2005) that mAb 9E2 interacted with the C-terminal portion of WNV E protein. ELISA with the corresponding antigen WNVEC demonstrated that Fc-9E2 retained specific binding to this antigen (Fig. 2d) . This was further confirmed by Western blot with purified WNVEC (data not shown).",

            "text": "The use of antibody-based therapies against infectious agents in routine clinical practice, although very efficient in many applications, is limited by several factors including safety issues and cost. Therapeutic antibodies are among the most expensive drugs used in clinical practice (Kasuya et al., 2005) . The high cost of Ig preparations is related to the fact that these reagents require special handling and are costly to obtain, produce, and maintain. Immunoglobulins derived from immune donors may contain adventitious agents (including yet unknown ones) or may be potentially bio-hazardous otherwise, since the 100% purity cannot be achieved. In addition, in vitro production of Abs, especially the full size, two-chain Abs, requires tedious optimization and the yields are often low. We show in this study that there is an alternative to purified Ab preparations for passive immunization. Gene-based delivery of protective recAbs offers a number of advantages. First, the recAbs are produced in vivo and therefore are properly processed by the host mechanisms. Second, there is no need for recAb purification, although clinical vector preparations have to be produced according to the accepted criteria. Third, the recAb gene expression is maintained over time, thus eliminating the need for repeated injections of Abs to maintain therapeutic concentrations. An important safety feature of the proposed treatment is that we used a replication incompetent Ad vector for recAb gene delivery. The ability of replication-deficient Ad vectors to mediate transient gene transfer looks especially attractive in the context of acute infectious disease treatment with recAbs.",

Pre-existing anti Ad immunity resulted from previous exposure to Ad either through natural infection or administration of a vector may affect applications in which long-term expression is necessary and which will require re-administration of vector following the eventual loss of therapeutic transgene expression. We show here that a single dose Ad-recAb treatment abrogated WNV infection in laboratory animals. Nevertheless, should a need for repeated Ad administrations arise, several studies have documented effective re-administration in certain applications. For example, in a phase I/II trial for recurrent ovarian cancer where intraperitoneal re-administration was used, transgene expression was measurable in 17 of 20 samples obtained after two or three cycles (Buller et al., 2002) . In another phase I clinical, 5 out of 6 tested patients' sera were positive for anti Ad antibodies but that did not result in reduction of the transgene expression after i.p. administration of Ad21 encoding for an intrabody (Alvarez et al., 2000) . Thus, it should be recognized that the ability to effectively repeat administer Ad vectors is dose-dependent and site-specific.",

MAb 9E2 was shown previously to recognize the Cterminal portion (domain III) of WNV E protein (Razumov et al., 2005) . Domain III is the putative receptor binding domain of the virus (Crill and Roehrig, 2001) and an important target for neutralizing antibodies (Beasley and Barrett, 2002; Oliphant et al., 2005; Razumov et al., 2005; Sanchez et al., 2005) . Neutralizing Abs that bind to the E protein prevent infection of cells by blocking attachment of virus to cellular receptors and attachment factors (Crill and Roehrig, 2001) . Recent data suggests that DIII-specific neutralizing antibodies may also be inhibiting at a post-attachment step . A replicationdeficient recombinant Ad vector has been generated to encode Fc-9E2 under the control of powerful CMV promoter. The recombinant Ad mediated sustained levels of the recAb production after systemic administration into mice, which lasted for at least 3 weeks post-inoculation. Our expectation that gene-based in vivo expression of recAbs may serve as an efficient treatment of an acute infectious process was confirmed in WNV challenge studies in mice treated with Ad/Fc-9E2. The experiments were performed using three regimens: (i) with the Ad vector given 1 day before the lethal WNV challenge; (ii) with Ad vector given simultaneous with the lethal WNV challenge; and (iii) with Ad vector given 1 day after the lethal WNV challenge. An outstanding animal protection was observed after a single injection of Ad/Fc-9E2 in all three treatments groups, which was contrasted by the high mortality in control groups that received Ad/Fc-G19 encoding an irrelevant recAb. All mice have survived in the groups receiving the Ad encoding the WNV-specific recAb simultaneously with and 24 h after the lethal WNV challenge. Treatments with Ad/Fc-9E2 in the WNV challenged animals resulted in significant and sustained specific recAb levels in sera of inoculated mice as determined by WNV-specific ELISA. Since WNV-specific IgM responses were not detected in these animals, we concluded that such treatment effectively suppressed the development of active WNV infection. Thus, a single dose of recombinant Ad vector that mediated WNV-specific recAb gene delivery resulted in abrogation of acute WNV infection, both in prophylactic and in therapeutic treatment regiments. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of Ad mediated recAb gene transfer that resulted in abrogation of an acute infectious process. Ablation of infection is supported by the observed suppression of early IgM response in animals that survived the lethal challenge. Earlier, Kasuya et al. (2005) had demonstrated an Ad mediated in vivo neutralization of anthrax toxin (Kasuya et al., 2005) but not infection caused by an active pathogen.",

Elimination of WNV disease was shown to be successful when pre-existing Abs were administered even at day 5 after virus challenge .

Determination of Ad-mediated Fc-9E2 efficacy at later WNV infection stages is the subject of our ongoing studies.",

The key event in the former mechanism is interaction of IgG attached to infected cells to Fc\u2425 receptor III. Residues Leu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Pro of the lower hinge of IgG1 have been implicated in the receptor binding (Lund et al., 1991) , and since they are preserved in Fc-9E2, this function should be present in the described construct. Residues D270, K322, P329, and P331 which are responsible for C1q complement sub-component binding to IgG (Idusogie et al., 2000) are also preserved in our construct and therefore, Fc-9E2 should have the latter function, too. Neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) plays important role in regulation of IgG circulation halflife favoring recycling and/or transcytosis rather than catabolism (Ghetie and Ward, 1997) . The residues responsible for Fc interaction to FcRn have been identified in CH2 and CH3 domains (Kim et al., 1999) and are as well preserved in our construct. To experimentally confirm that these important effector functions are indeed retained in the construct, we are planning detailed studies of mechanisms of Fc-9E2-mediated anti-WNV protection.",
