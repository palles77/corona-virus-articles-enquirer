The cytopathic strains of this virus (cpBVDV) induce dramatic cytoplasmic vacuolization in cell cultures, while infection with the non-cytopathic (NCP-BVDV) strains produces no overt changes in the host cells. Our results show that extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization is the earliest morphological change in response to cpBVDV infection in MDBK cells. Cells with extensive vacuolization showed no co-existing chromatin condensation, caspase activation, or loss of membrane integrity. In addition, the caspase inhibitor (zVAD-fmk), although improving cell viability of infected cells from 6.7 \u00b1 2.2% to 18.8 \u00b1 2.2%, did not prevent vacuolization. On the ultrastructural level, the virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles are single membrane structures containing organelles and cellular debris, which appear capable of fusing with other vacuoles and engulfing surrounding cytoplasmic materials. LysoTracker Red which marks lysosomes did not stain the virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles. In addition, this lysosomal dye could be observed in the cytoplasm of vacuolized cells, suggesting a lysosomal abnormality. Our data demonstrate that cpBVDV induced a novel cell death pathway in MDBK cells that is primarily associated with lysosomal dysfunction and the formation of phagocytic cytoplasmic vacuoles, and this mode of cell death is different from apoptosis and necrosis.",

To date, the nature of this vacuolization during BVDV infection is not understood. Recently, it was suggested that cpBVDV-induced apoptosis is responsible for the virus-associated CPE (Grummer et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1996) . However, the morphology of apoptotic cell death is generally not associated with cytoplasmic vacuoles. Furthermore, although inhibitors of apoptosis, including zVAD-fmk, blocked apoptosis in cpBVDV-infected cells and significantly improved cell survival, they failed to achieve suppression of cytoplasmic vacuolization (Bendfeldt et al., 2003; Grummer et al., 2002a) .",

In addition, by 24 h post-infection, vacuolized cells started to round up and detach, suggesting that virus-induced dynamic cellular pathology in whole population of cells have to be investigated within first 24 h. By 24-36 h post-infection, about 50% of monolayers in all wells inspected for this study were partially destroyed. Further incubation of infected cells beyond 36 h post-infection resulted in a significant number of detached cells, making it difficult to determine the mode of the cell death. Infection of MDBK cells with the noncytopathic strain of BVDV (NY-1) did not result in cytoplasmic vacuolization or disruption of the cellular monolayer ( Fig. 1A ). In addition, ncpBVDV-infected MDBK cells could be easily cultured without any morphological signs of infection. Infection of FBK cells with NADL also resulted in appearance of vacuolized cells, which were not observed in uninfected cells (data not shown).",

In this work, using a monoclonal antibody to viral protein, NS3, to identify BVDV-infected cells (Deregt et al., 2005) , we demonstrated that NS3 can be easily detected in infected cells with cytoplasmic vacuolization, suggesting the virus induces vacuolization of infected MDBK cells. Interestingly, ncpBVDV does not produce any morphological changes in infected cells, and can actually block CPE when co-infected with cpBVDV (Bendfeldt et al., 2003; Yamane et al., 2005) . Thus, vacuolization is unlikely to be important for viral replication. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrated that NS3, which is required for viral replication (Gu et al., 2000) , was identified throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells, but the lumen of vacuoles were free of this protein.",

This does not appear to be the case for BVDV. Three classes of autophagy have been described: macroautophagy, chaperonemediated autophagy, and microautophagy. Macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy are normal cellular stress responses designed to remove and recycle misfolded proteins and damaged organelles (Cuervo, 2004; Shintani and Klionsky, 2004) . Electron microscopy of macroautophagic responses reveals two subtypes of electron-dense macroautophagic vacuoles:autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes (Eskelinen, 2005; Lawrence and Brown, 1992) both of which are double membrane-bound structures. These macroautophagic structures are also labeled with LysoTracker Red which is easily detected by wide-field and confocal fluorescent microscopy (Moriyasu et al., 2003; Rideout et al., 2004) . Pharmacologically, macroautophagy can be distinguished from the other types of autophagy by its sensitivity to wortmannin and other phosphoinositide 3kinases (PI3-kinase) inhibitors (Finn et al., 2005; Petiot et al., 2000) . The BVDV-induced vacuoles are single membrane structures not labeled with LysoTracker Red.",

LC3 was found to be co-localized with LysoTracker-stained macroautophagic structures (Bampton et al., 2005) . However, further work on LC3 and macroautophagy indicates that LC3 could be incorporated into protein aggregates independent of autophagy (Kuma et al., 2007) . In addition, detection of macroautophagy-associated LC3 conversion (LC3 I to LC3 II) could be problematic because LC3 II tends to be much more sensitive to detection by immunoblotting than LC3 I (Mizushima and Yoshimori, 2007) . We chose not to pursue LC3 staining for the above reason and because the EM morphological studies, LysoTracker staining, and insensitivity to wortmannin clearly demonstrated that virus-induced vacuolization is inconsistent with macroautophagy. Chaperonemediated autophagy does not exhibit cytoplasmic vacuoles and can only be detected with specific probes . Microautophagy (Kunz et al., 2004; Muller et al., 2000; Sattler and Mayer, 2000) is defined as the sequestration of cytoplasmic components by direct invagination of lysosomal or vesicular membrane, followed by budding of engulfed small vesicular structures into the lumen of the autophagolysosomes containing cellular debris. This process is topologically equivalent to membrane invagination during multivesicular body formation and to the budding of enveloped viruses (Kunz et al., 2004) . Functionally, microautophagy is associated with macroautophagy, thus, counterbalancing macroautophagy-mediated membrane influx, which is essential for resumption of cell growth (Dubouloz et al., 2005) .",

We determined that the vacuoles in infected cells contain organelles' and cytoplasmic debris. Further examination of cytoplasmic vacuoles revealed that they are capable of fusing with each other and engulfing surrounding cytoplasmic components, suggesting that virus-induced vacuoles possess phagocytic properties. This morphological observation correlates well with extensive growth of vacuoles and disappearance of cytoplasm in infected cells, demonstrated at the level of light microscopy. This morphology is consistent with previously described microautophagy, where the cytoplasmic vacuoles seem to be the primary mechanism for sequestering cytoplasm and organelles in cells (Tuttle and Dunn, 1995; Tuttle et al., 1993; Veenhuis et al., 1983; Yokota et al., 1993) . However, the phagocytic vacuolization response induced by the virus seems to be cytotoxic, which is different from postulated functional role of microautophagy for cell survival (Dubouloz et al., 2005) . In addition, because microautophagy is thought to be in a close association with macroautophagy, the absence of BVDV-induced macroautophagy could also suggest the absence of virus-induced microautophagy. Therefore, cpBVDV-induced cytoplasmic phagocytic vacuolization appears to be morphologically similar to microautophagy, but functionally it is different from previously described macroautophagy, chaperon-mediated autophagy, and microautophagy.",

If lysomal dysfunction occurs, an appearance of lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsins and serine proteases in cytoplasm is likely to result in activation of number of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways in addition to general cell lysis, as was initially described in serum-starved PC12 cells (Uchiyama, 2001) . Interestingly, a significant proportion of viral NS3, produced during infection with cytopathic BVDV strains, was found to be associated with smooth endoplasmic reticulum (Zhang et al., 2003) , known to be involved in the formation of lysosomes (Novikoff, 1976 ). Thus, it is possible that the stress induced by NS3 on smooth endoplasmic reticulum in cells infected with cytopathic strains of BVDV could be the cause of lysosomal abnormalities and induction of formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles with phagocytic properties.",

Evidence has been presented to suggest that autophagy is induced by viruses to provide intracellular compartments and scaffolds to assist the replication process (Novoa et al., 2005; Wileman, 2006) . BVDV provides some unique insight into this area in that two biotypes of the virus exist, one that induces extensive vacuole formation (cpBVDV) and the other which does not (ncpBVDV). Both biotypes replicate equally well to produce infectious progeny, which indicates that the formation of vacuoles is irrelevant to virus replication. The autophagy-like response in this instance may be more related to a cellular defense mechanism of an innate or adaptive immune response (Deretic, 2005) .",
