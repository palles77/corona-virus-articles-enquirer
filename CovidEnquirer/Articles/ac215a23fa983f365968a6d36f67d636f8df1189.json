Dilatation and anatomical distortion of conducting airways can result from acute and chronic airway injury from airway infection (wet bronchiectasis) or from adjacent parenchymal scarring (\"dry\" or traction bronchiectasis). A number of infections can damage the large airways and leading bronchiectasis. Reversible cylindrical bronchiectasis may appear radiographically in patients following an acute bacterial pneumonia. As this change often resolves, biopsies of suspicious bronchiectatic regions should be deferred until a period of weeks past postacute infection. As regions of chronic bronchiectasis are fed by varicose bronchial arteries that often course directly beneath the airways surface, endoscopic biopsies of bronchiectatic areas are contraindicated. Prior to the development of childhood vaccination, viral exanthems and Bordetella pertussis were common causes of bronchiectasis ( Fig. 9 .31). Cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder of chloride transport, is currently a leading cause of severe bronchiectasis in young adults, as advances in management have resulted in patients surviving beyond childhood ( Fig. 9 .32).",

The characteristic change in the disorder is the accumulation of foamy macrophages that show intense staining with PAS ( Fig. 9 .52).

This Ghon focus together with the accompanying calcified site of infection in a hilar lymph node is termed the Ranke complex ( Fig. 9 .55), and the foci of primary disseminated infection are termed Simon's foci. At all sites, the cellular response to M. tuberculosis is characterized by nodular collections of epithelioid macrophages with multinucleated giant cells, the tuberculoid granuloma, or tubercle. These can undergo central necrosis due to a cellmediated hypersensitivity response. Sites of tuberculous infection may also show neutrophilic and eosinophilic exudates but these are generally not prominent features. The mature tuberculoid granuloma is surrounded by a rim of T-lymphocytes and contained by an outer zone of fibrosis ( Fig. 9 .56).

They are composed of a vesicle with one or two layers of phialides that produce the infective conidial spores, and the morphology of the fruiting body allows for accurate speciated in situ. In general, the specific diagnosis of \"aspergillosis\" should be avoided unless the aspergil is identified, as other fungi can be morphologically virtually indistinguishable in tissue.
