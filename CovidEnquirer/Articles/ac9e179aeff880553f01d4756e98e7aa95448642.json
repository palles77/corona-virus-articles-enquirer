            "text": "There has recently been an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide, with China and Hong Kong being the worst affected. The World Health Organization issued a global alert about the outbreak of SARS and instituted worldwide surveillance on March 13, 2003. 1 SARS is an acute respiratory infection that is caused by a new member of the coronavirus family. The main symptoms include fever of 38\u00b0C, malaise, chills, headache, and muscle pain. Chest X-rays show changes compatible with pneumonia. Other symptoms include coughing, diarrhea, and shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing. The incubation period is typically 2 to 7 days but can be as long as 10 days. 2 There were 1750 reported SARS cases in Hong Kong at the time of this writing (June 7, 2003) . Among those affected, 1350 (77%) had recovered and been discharged from hospital. The total number of fatal cases to date is 286. 3 Figure 1 shows the age-gender specific incidence of SARS. While SARS is by no means a disease of the elderly alone, a large number of cases are in the elderly, and men 75 or older show the highest incidence rate (10%). 3 Furthermore, the patient's age was strongly associated with SARS-related mortality, regardless of the time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital. 4 SARS is lethal for the elderly. Mortality for patients younger than 60 stands at 6.8%, but this increases dramatically to 55% for patients more than 60. 4 There are about 50,000 elderly persons living in 741 nursing homes in Hong Kong. 5 In 54 of these nursing homes (7.2%) a resident has contracted SARS. In addition, 11 staff members working in nursing homes have contracted SARS; two have died. 5 With this in mind, the overall objective of this study was to explore the knowledge and understanding of SARS in the elderly and to elicit the prevention and precautionary measures taken by the elderly and by nursing homes to keep the disease under control and lessen the death toll of the elderly in particular.",

Verbal consent was SARS evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has affected many areas of the world recently and is becoming a global problem. Hong Kong and China have been most severely affected by this new infectious disease. The elderly population is highly vulnerable, and mortality in those older than 65 years is more than 50%. In our study, 27 health care workers and 40 elderly residents in a nursing home were interviewed to investigate their level of knowledge of SARS and its prevention. Most of the elderly residents knew little regarding SARS and prevention strategies, despite access to outside news by TV, radio, and visitors. Also, the worry and fear of an outbreak of SARS among staff working in the nursing home was considered to be high. Tailored education programs to promote awareness and prevention of SARS for the elderly are needed. Also, more in-service training, support, and counseling are strongly indicated for staff to promote disease prevention and improve quality of care.

Inclusion criteria for the residents included being 60 or older, having resided in the nursing home for at least 3 months, and being cognitively intact based on Abbreviated Mental Test (Modified score of = 8). 6 In terms of the staff, the inclusion criteria included being older than 21 and having worked in the nursing home for at least 3 months.

In addition, health education regarding SARS and the importance of good personal hygiene in limiting the spread of SARS had been provided to residents via various sources and means, such as nurses giving health talks and pamphlets given to residents and relatives. To our surprise, however, very few of the participants in the nursing home could be described as knowledgeable regarding SARS and its prevention. Some of these residents were worried about contracting the disease themselves. However, the majority of the residents studied had either little or no knowledge about SARS. Not surprisingly perhaps, those with the least knowledge also had the least concerns about contracting the disease. The lack of knowledge and concern may make them more vulnerable in terms of contracting SARS. It is normal and justifiable to have concerns about contracting a potentially fatal disease, and these concerns can be useful to drive the implementation of precautionary measures that require active cooperation and participation of individuals. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that justifiable and constructive concerns must not be allowed to become destructive fears. The results of this study indicate that more tailored health education specifically targeted to inform and allay the fears of the elderly in the nursing home would be useful. The majority of staff worried about contracting SARS at work and was concerned about an outbreak in the nursing home. These worries were caused largely by a tragic large-scale outbreak in a housing estate triggered by a single visitor with SARS and accounted for more than 300 SARS cases and more than 30 deaths. In addition, staff were very much aware that several medical staff and a health care assistant in a nursing home had died recently of SARS in Hong Kong.",

Nonetheless, vigilance must be maintained, especially in the care of high-risk elderly subjects. All citizens, the elderly in particular, must continue to practice general preventive measures and guard against lapses in personal and environmental hygiene. Awareness of SARS should remain high because this disease is likely to remain a threat worldwide for some time to come. Our experience in Hong Kong shows SARS to be highly infectious and that infection in an elderly person is often fatal. Increasing awareness of SARS in the elderly and their caregivers and enhancing preventive measures are crucial to avoid new outbreaks. The worry and fear of an outbreak of SARS among staff working in the nursing home are still high. More in-service training, support, and counseling are strongly indicated to promote prevention and improve quality of care. Tailored education for the residents of elderly care homes is also important because their active participation is needed in SARS prevention, and their fears and concerns of SARS, while often justified and possibly useful, must not be allowed to compromise their quality of life. 3. Are there any cases of SARS in this nursing home? 4.As the mortality rate of SARS for the elderly is so high, do you fear of an outbreak here? 5.What has been done to control the spread of SARS here?
