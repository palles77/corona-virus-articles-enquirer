Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a molecular chaperone, is an important host factor for the replication of single-strand RNA viruses. In the current study, we examined the effect of the Hsp90 inhibitor pochonin D, in vitro and in vivo, using a murine model of human rhinovirus type 1B (HRV1B) infection. Our data suggested that Hsp90 inhibition significantly reduced the inflammatory cytokine production and lung damage caused by HRV1B infection. The viral titer was significantly lowered in HRV1B-infected lungs and in Hela cells upon treatment with pochonin D. Infiltration of innate immune cells including granulocytes and monocytes was also reduced in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) by pochonin D treatment after HRV1B infection. Histological analysis of the lung and respiratory tract showed that pochonin D protected the mice from HRV1B infection. Collectively, our results suggest that the Hsp90 inhibitor, pochonin D, could be an attractive antiviral therapeutic for treating HRV infection.",

HRV infection in humans usually causes common cold and mild illnesses, but is sometimes associated with asthma exacerbation and viral upper respiratory tract infection (Bartlett et al., 2008) . HRVs are divided into three distinct species including type A, type B, and type C, with over 100 immunologically noncross reactive HRV serotypes (Park et al., 2012) . Among the HRV serotypes, the majority accounting for 90%, use human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) as their cellular receptor and do not bind mouse ICAM-1, whereas the remaining 10% of the minor serotypes including HRV1B use a member of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL-1) receptor family and can bind the mouse counterpart (Bartlett et al., 2008) . Thus, HRV1B is thought to be a suitable model for murine infection.",

In addition, a recent study has shown that Hsp90 is practically required for viral protein homeostasis and is critical for viral replication, folding, and assembly (Nagy et al., 2011) . Hsp90 has been shown to play an important role in the replication of various viruses including DNA and RNA viruses, with both positive-and negative-sense genomes, and also double-stranded RNA viruses, suggesting that Hsp90 inhibitors may have broad-spectrum antiviral effects (Geller et al., 2012) . In this regard, several Hsp90 inhibitors have been studied for the development of antivirals, in vitro, against influenza, SARS-CoV, HCV, HIV (Li et al., 2004) , and herpes viruses (HSV1/2, CMV, VZV) (Sun et al., 2013) , as well as against picornaviruses including poliovirus, coxsackievirus, and rhinovirus (Geller et al., 2012) . Hsp90 inhibitors are very attractive antiviral agents for infections lacking antiviral therapies and for an urgent response to the outbreak of novel viral diseases. In addition, application of Hsp90 inhibitors to several animal models of infectious diseases was demonstrated to decrease viral replication in case of Poliovirus and HCV infections (Geller et al., 2007; Nakagawa et al., 2007) . These experiments emphasize the possibility of using these inhibitors as human therapeutic agents.",

Virus infection increases the secretion of CXCL1, CCL2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 from leukocytes and activates innate immune responses to induce inflammation (Subauste et al., 1995; Saklatvala et al., 1996; Bartlett et al., 2008) . To evaluate the effect of pochonin D on pulmonary cytokines and chemokines induced by HRV infection, mice were infected and treated with 200 \u03bcg/kg of pochonin D twice, 1 h before and 4 h after intranasal HRV1B infection. At 8 h after HRV1B infection, lungs and BALF were obtained from the mice, and subjected to ELISA for measuring cytokines and chemokines. In the lungs, the levels of CCL2, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and CXCL1 were significantly increases by HRV1B infection, and these were decreased by pochonin D treatment (Fig. 2B-2F ). Similarly, the levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and CXCL in the BALF were significantly increased by HRV1B infection and reduced by pochonin D treatment; however, the level of CCL2 in BALF was not significantly altered after HRV1B infection (Fig. 3) . These data indicate that increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by rhinovirus infection was mitigated by pochonin D treatment. ",

We investigated whether the same was true for rhinovirus. We therefore assessed cellular infiltration of neutrophils into the BALF of HRV1B-infected mice treated with pochonin D or vehicle (Fig. 4) . CD11c + F4/80 + alveolar macrophages were excluded from the gating for neutrophils. The number of MDSCs in BALF showing the phenotype of granulocytic neutrophils was significantly higher in rhinovirus-infected mice than in non-infected mice. Moreover, the number of these cells decreased with pochonin D treatment in virus-infected mice (Fig. 4B) . Similarly, the percentage of MDSC cells in BALF from rhinovirus-infected mice was higher than that in control mice, and the percentage of granulocytic neutrophils in BALF from HRV1B-infected mice was reduced by pochonin D treatment. Thus, we could confirm that inflammatory cell infiltrates in the lung were significantly increased by HRV1B infection, and could be significantly inhibited by administration of pochonin D.",

On the contrary, the condition of the trachea in HRV1B-infected mice treated with pochonin D showed amelioration of damage caused by HRV1B infection compared to that in vehicle-treated mice. Despite the presence of phlegm and decreased number of cilia, the cilia in pochonin D-treated mice after HRV1B infection were relatively intact.

            "text": "Generally, virus-specific proteins have drawn attention for the treatment of viral infection as targets. However, the focus of antiviral approaches has recently started to move toward targeting host factors essential to virus multiplication. Hsp90, a molecular chaperone that regulates the function, turnover, and trafficking of several proteins including signaling and regulatory proteins, is one of the important host factors that play critical roles in the viral life cycle. Hsp90 inhibitors have been reported to inhibit Ebola virus (EBOV) replication, and cause degradation of the viral polymerase (Smith et al., 2010) . However, the exact mechanism underlying the anti-EBOV activity of Hsp90 inhibitors remains unknown. In influenza virus infection, Hsp90 is required for viral genome replication. As Hsp90 associates with subunits of the influenza virus, inhibition of Hsp90 leads to degradation of viral subunits. Besides, Hsp90 inhibitors reduce the levels of the assembled polymerase complex, resulting in decreased viral RNA levels (Momose et al., 2002) . A recent study showed that Hsp90 is also required for the replication of beta-herpesviruses (Burch and Weller, 2005) . In the human cytomegalovirus infection model, Hsp90 inhibition resulted in degradation of the viral polymerase and reduction of viral gene expression via downregulation of the PI3-kinase pathway (Basha et al., 2005) . Similarly, in the flock house virus, Hsp90 influences RNA polymerase stability (Kampmueller and Miller, 2005) . Collectively, pharmacological inhibitors of Hsp90 have potential as broad spectrum antiviral agents. In addition to their universal activity against diverse viral infections, Hsp90 inhibitors show the possibility of overcoming viral drug resistance. Most antiviral agents lead to generation of drug-resistant variants, which is one of the major issues in the development of effective antiviral therapy (zur Wiesch et al., 2011) . Interestingly, Hsp90 inhibitors are not reported to induce viral drug resistance till date. Therefore, they might be particularly useful for antiviral therapy against viruses prone to develop drug resistance (Geller et al., 2012) .",

Although ribavirin is known to have a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several respiratory viruses, it has limitations due to its controversial efficacy and toxicity (Kneyber et al., 2000) . Indeed, ribavirin did not show efficient antiviral activity against HRV1B infection in our experiment, and 50 \u03bcg/ml of ribavirin showed only marginal antiviral activity in Hela cells infected with HRV1B (data not shown).",

Although pochonin D is a well-known Hsp90 inhibitor (Moulin et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2016; Choe et al., 2017) , it is still uncertain that the inhibition of Hsp90 by pochonin D is directly associated with the antiviral activity of it. We found that treatment with pochonin D lowered the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung and BALF of mice, which were increased by rhinovirus infection. Furthermore, the virus titers of HRV-infected mice treated with pochonin D were significantly decreased to levels similar to those in na\u00efve mice. We also examined the levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines/cytokines (CCL2, CXCL1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2) in lung lysates and lung RNA. Their concentrations were decreased by pochonin D treatment in HRV1B-infected mice, and were comparable to the chemokines/cytokines levels in na\u00efve mice. These data suggest that pochonin D may reduce inflammatory damage in rhinovirus-infected mice. We also found that neutrophil infiltration into the inflammatory site was reduced by pochonin D treatment in HRV1B-infected mice. This reduction may be due to the mild viral infection and inflammation in pochonin D-treated group. Finally, we observed the histopathology of the lung and airway, and found that pochonin D treatment ameliorated the damage induced by rhinovirus infection in the lung and airway.",

Adverse ef-fects were also observed in mice treated with pochonin D at 1.75 mg/kg and 600 \u03bcg/kg, but not with 200 \u03bcg/kg (Data not shown). The dose of 200 \u03bcg/kg pochonin D was non-toxic to mice and was also more effective at controlling HRV infection compared to the dose of 600 \u03bcg/kg.
