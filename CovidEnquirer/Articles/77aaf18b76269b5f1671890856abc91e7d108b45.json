The methodology proposed in this study is capable of creating a three-dimensional \"Research focus parallelship network\" and a \"Keyword Co-occurrence Network\", together with a two-dimensional knowledge map. The network and knowledge map can be depicted differently by choosing different information for the network actor, i.e. country, institute, paper and keyword, to reflect knowledge structures from macro, to meso, to micro-levels. A total of 223 highly cited papers published by 142 institutes and 26 countries are analyzed in this study. China and the US are the two countries located at the core of knowledge structure and China is ranked no. 1. This quantitative exploration provides a way to unveil important or emerging components in scientific development and also to visualize knowledge; thus an objective evaluation of scientific research is possible for quantitative technology management. drug reactions [32,33], biotechnology [34,35], environmental science [36], condensed matter physics [37], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), tsunami [38,39], and Parkinson's disease [40]. Also, citation-based analyses together with keyword analysis have been investigated. For example, Kajikawa utilized citation analysis on SCI papers together with clustering papers and analyzing keywords to understand structural change of sustainable energy [41], biomass and bio-fuels [42] and organic LED [43].",

These materials typically consist of an inorganic (host) solid containing an organic component or vice versa [44] . Nanocomposite usually combines nano-dimensional phases with distinct differences in structure, chemistry, and properties. The mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical, electrochemical, catalytic properties of the nanocomposite will differ markedly from that of the component materials [44] . Polymer nanocomposite with nanoparticles added into polymer matrix can enhance its performance, often to a very dramatic degree, by simply capitalizing on the nature and properties of the nanoscale filler, for example, reinforcing a polymer matrix with much stiffer nanoparticles [45] [46] [47] .",

Many researchers proposed and applied these methodologies to various knowledge fields for understanding the paradigm or the dynamic development of selected knowledge fields [3] .

He also proposes a systematic Literature-Related Discovery method for linking two or more literature concepts that have heretofore not been linked, in order to produce novel, interesting, plausible, and intelligible knowledge [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Ding et al. mapped information retrieval research by using co-word analysis on papers collected from the Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) for the period of 1987-1997 [21] . Baldwin et al. mapped ethics and dementia research by using keywords [22] . Tian et al. used the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) database to measure scientific output of the field of Geographic Information System (GIS) by using keywords [23] . Similar approaches have been made to map knowledge evolution in other fields, such as software engineering [24] , chemistry [25] , scientometrics [26] , neural network research [27, 28] , biological safety [29] , optomechatronics [30] , bioeletronics [31] , adverse A \"structure\" defines what makes up a system. A \"structure\" is a collection of inter-related components or services [67] . The more concrete way of describing a structure is \"network\" where the two main components of a network, 1) network actors and 2) network ties, correspond respectively with \"components\" and \"inter-relationship among components\" in a structure. Therefore applying network theory to understanding knowledge structure should be feasible if network actors and network ties can be welldefined. We previously investigated the knowledge structure of patented technology for the same field of \"electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite\" by integrating network theory and patent citation information [68] . In this case, patent is the network actor and citation is the network tie. In this study, we apply network theory on scientific papers to draw the knowledge structure of \"electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite\".",

Both actors and interactions can usually be described by texts, and specifically, by words. Thus knowledge development can be described through keyword network development. Newman reviewed structure and function of complex networks, and argued for both the word matching network possesses and the obvious characteristics of small-words [75] The research of Cancho [76] also justified the small-world phenomenon in English word networks. Watts and Strogatz and Watts contributed to expansion of the small-world concept, from conventional neuroscience and bio-information systems to any natural or human system that can be modeled by a network [77, 78] . Motter et al. constructed a conceptual network from the entries in a thesaurus dictionary, considering two words connected if they express similar concepts. He argued that language networks exhibit the small-world property as a result of natural optimization, and these findings are important not only for linguistics, but also for cognitive science [58] .",

A network generated by this method is defined as KCO network (keyword co-occurrence network). Detailed explanation for these two methods is as follows: 1) RFP network (Research focus parallelship network): the relation between two different papers occurred because these two papers share at least one same keyword. For example, paper is used as a network actor (network node) and any of two actors sharing one same keyword will be linked. This is based on an assumption made in this study that keyword represents the core research of a paper. Any two papers sharing the same keyword implies that these two researches are partially overlapping in an area that can be represented by that keyword. The two papers are thus regarded as a pair of parallel papers and the constructed network is defined as an RFP network. However, network node is not necessarily the paper. It can also be other actors which carry knowledge, e.g. paper (first author), research institute, or country. The three types of RFP networks are summarized as:",

Freeman suggested three methods of centrality measurement for a network: 1) degree centrality, 2) betweenness centrality, and 3) closeness centrality [82] . Network properties are calculated by the above three methods in order to understand the influencing power of country, research institute, and paper.

A total of 482 network actors generating 671 network ties were originally created, but the large number of network actors and ties lead to a highly dense network structure which is hard to interpret visually. Therefore, we select the most important 77 network actors which degree centralities are equal to or larger than 4 for constructing KCO network, A total of 77 network actors and 220 network ties are shown (Fig. 5) . Actors with higher centrality and thicker ties form the major backbone of this knowledge field. Fig. 5 shows the backbone actors are nanocomposite, composite, conducting polymer, carbon nanotube, polyaniline, and polypyrrole. These are together with some other important actors, e.g. multi-wall carbon nanotube, electrical property, caron nanofiber. These 77 keywords can be categorized into structure, property, compound, process, and application, and are directly or indirectly connected to the backbone actors. Carbon nanotube has surprisingly high centrality, indicating its critical role in this field. By evaluating connectivities among actors globally, the rationale why two actors are linked maybe obtained; hence it is possible to create scenarios for a particular actor. For example, the analysis of actors connected to carbon nanotube provides some findings: is 1) Carbon nanotube is the most important nano-scaled structure in the field, 2) Carbon nanotube possibly helps reinforce mechanical property and electrical property, and 3) There is the potential to apply electrical conducting nanocomposite polymer on biosensor or supercapacitor with the aid of carbon nanotube.",

More papers mean more opportunities to create linkages to other actors. Therefore countries with more papers are anticipated to have higher centrality and are thus being positioned at the core of the network. Accordingly, countries with more papers shown in Table 1 are mostly consistent with countries with higher centrality calculated in Table 5 . However, there are some exceptions. For example, India is ranked number 3 in terms of number of papers, but not in the top 10 centralities ranking. Brazil is ranked outside the top 10 of numbers of papers, but ranked top 3 for its high centrality.

This indicates a nice international collaboration; based on which, each country finds its particular way to contribute different knowledge to this field. The more uniform distribution of actors in the map implies higher efficiency for the knowledge to be developed. In Fig. 6 , the distribution of countries is pretty uniform but still we can find two isolated islands 4) Keyword as actor: Fig. 9 shows a Y-shaped continent and two separated islands denoted as \"membrane\" located on the left and \"electrorheology\" located on the middle bottom. The Y-shaped big continent refers to the major trend of electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite. But \"membrane\" island and \"electrorheology\" island are conventionally associated with traditional polymer. This is why both are small isolated islands separated from the big Y-shaped continent featured by modern nano related technology. To understand how keyword components are positioned to construct the big continent, the big continent can be further magnified to understand more detailed components.",

A total of 482 keywords contained in 223 highly cited papers (number of received citations \u226724) have been analyzed in this study. Three-dimensional networks and two-dimensional maps are quantitatively and visually created to describe the knowledge structure. Keywords such as nanocomposite, carbon nanotube, polyaniline, conducting polymer, composite, polypyrrole, multi-wall carbon nanotube, electrical conductivity, etc. are important components of the backbone knowledge structure of electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite. Also, China, US, and Brazil are countries located at the core of the structure.",

However, in the field of electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite, the networks and maps constructed in this study indicate that China is ranked no. 1. However, if we compare several publication performance indicators used in Table 9 and Fig. 10 , the number of highly cited paper for both US and China are both equal to 55. Similarly the median citations per paper (41 for the US and 42 for China) indicate that the statistics are not dominated by a few highly cited papers. Citation analysis which is usually used as an indicator of paper quality shows that average citations received by highly cited paper are 62.7 (citations/paper) for the US and 47.4 (citations/paper) for China. The US is higher and China is lower than the global average (54 citations/paper), and each US paper receives 15 more citations on average than Chinese papers. In addition, the most highly cited paper of the US has been cited 319 times, while the most highly cited paper of China has only been cited 98 times. US papers have greater impact on later publications; so there is no doubt that the US has more advanced developments in electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite. All of this suggests that the US should not be second to China. These observations are different from keyword-based network analysis in this paper. The discrepancy between the findings obtained from keyword-based network analysis and the findings from highly cited paper comparison ( Fig. 10 and Table 9 ) is due to the different mechanism used for evaluating scientific papers. The higher centrality of China than the US obtained in this study has more to do with the keyword linkages involved in the network. China has better accessibility to other countries by way of keyword linkages and is therefore ranked no. 1 in network centralities. Also, China has a larger number of papers (896 papers) than the US (787 papers); although its total impact is not comparable to the US.",

The other countries are connected strongly or weakly and form a big and irregular continent dominated by China and USA which sit at opposite sides. Countries between China and USA are England, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Canada, etc. which are most likely developed countries. China, Brazil and India are three of the four BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and are surprisingly connected in the map. This indicates that their research interests are relatively similar. 2) Research institute as actor: Fig. 7 shows a very solid continent on the left and a very small island (Germany's GKSS Research Centre) on the top right corner. The island is dominated by Chinese Academy of Science, Federal University of Paran\u00e1, Chinese Academy of Engineering and Physics, and Nanjin University. This suggests Germany's GKSS Research Centre has different research interests from other research institutes. 3) Paper as actor: Fig. 8 shows the paper (first author) knowledge map where a small island (Karthikeyan C. S., GKSS Research Center in Germany) on the top left corner and a big continent in the middle can be observed. The several dominating authors in the big island are from China and Brazil. The very dense and concentrated continent indicates that most researchers have research interests inter-related to each other. Instead of putting more resources on similar research and increasing the concentration of the continent, what is desirable in the future is to expand the continent by introducing resources on research areas different from what they are in the continent.",
