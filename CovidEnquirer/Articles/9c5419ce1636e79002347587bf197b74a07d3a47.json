As such, the term URI has come to encompass multiple clinical entities including pharyngitis, sinusitis, and bronchitis, as well as nonspecific respiratory infections, a designation that includes the common cold. The classification scheme based upon the predominate anatomic site of the presenting symptom complex tends to be poorly specific for directing therapy [5] . These diagnoses and their treatment will be examined relative to the nonspecific URI. Determining the evidence-based indications and relative value of antibiotic therapy for each may limit unnecessary use. Although a thorough examination of the viral URI is beyond the scope of this article, brief review of the nonspecific or undifferentiated URI and its treatment may provide some context for a discussion of these more specific conditions.",

Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of the URI based upon a nonfocal presentation have been developed in an effort to limit the indiscriminate use of antibiotics for what are generally viral illnesses [7] . The course of the viral URI, also termed acute rhinopharyngitis, is generally self-limited in nature and mild in severity. Symptoms may persist for greater than 1 week in duration in more than 50% of cases, and persist for 2 weeks in 25% [8] . The cause is most commonly rhinovirus and to a lesser extent coronavirus (typically in midwinter), and adenovirus (typically in spring to fall). Although laboratory identification can be accomplished, the time required to identify the cause may exceed the duration of the illness and the yields may be highly variable [2] . Syndromes involving symptoms of greater severity and more commonly including the lower respiratory tract are caused by influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncitial virus [9] . There may be some benefit in the prompt identification of influenza to initiate timely neuraminidase inhibitor therapy [10, 11] . It appears, however, that neither a rapid influenza test nor a clinical prediction rule is superior to clinical judgment in establishing the diagnosis [12] .",

Their benefit in preventing life-threatening complications, such as meningitis, sepsis, or abscess, in such patients has not been adequately assessed [8] . Bacterial sinusitis may develop as a complication in a minority of patients and is reviewed later. Improvement is expected in the URI by the first week, notwithstanding reports that sinus changes may be demonstrated on CT studies in most patients in the first few days of illness [13] . A recent systematic review of the literature has found insufficient evidence to warrant the use of antibiotics for URIs in adults or children [14] . Adults experienced a greater rate of adverse effects with antibiotics than with placebo. Patients who have respiratory infections may have certain expectations for antibiotic prescriptions, and physicians may prescribe antibiotics based on their perceptions of these expectations; however, patient satisfaction has been correlated with physician time spent with them and the patient's understanding of their diagnosis to a greater extent than the prescription of an antibiotic [15] . When patients who had upper respiratory symptoms were randomized to receive immediate antibiotics, or to have antibiotic use delayed by 48 hours, clinical outcomes were not significantly different for most symptoms, although some symptom scores worsened in the delayed use groups who had sore throat and otitis media [16] . Significant variability of symptom scores was noted between these trials. Clinical decision support systems, guiding physicians in appropriate antibiotic use for respiratory infections may reduce inappropriate use [17] .",

In combination with decongestants, no effect was seen in small children, but some benefit in general recovery and nasal symptoms was noted in older children and adults [19] . Intranasal ipratropium decreases rhinorrhea, and may decrease sneezing and promote nasal drying [20] . Evidence for the use of zinc in the treatment of URI is inconclusive [21] , and Echinacea extract showed no significant effects in either infection rates with rhinovirus or symptom severity [22] .

Bacterial causes of sore throat include group A b-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS), the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis, and non-group-A streptococcus. Less common causes are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. A rare cause is Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, which is associated with an exanthema that may mimic the rash of scarlet fever [27] .

Instead, recommendations are to assess by RADT the patient who have two to three clinical criteria (intermediate risk) and treat only for a positive test. Patients who have three or four criteria are treated empirically. All others are neither tested nor treated. This approach acknowledges the chance of undertreatment based on testing only those designated as intermediate to high risk by criteria (both sensitivity and specificity of approximately 75%), while emphasizing the relatively low likelihood of suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever.",

Although it is usually caused by a viral infection, rhinosinusitis is often attributed by patients and physicians to bacterial cause. Noninfectious causes of sinusitis include allergy, foreign body, deviated septum, tumor, polyps, and barotrauma [25] . Although bacterial sinusitis may complicate only 0.5% to 2% of URIs, it accounts for a disproportionate 21% of antibiotic prescriptions written [46] . Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) shares symptoms with the viral URI, including rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, facial pressure, and fever, which may lead the patient to request antibiotics from their physician. Though antibiotic therapy may be beneficial for bacterial sinusitis, the definitive diagnosis is made by sinus aspiration, an invasive procedure not typically performed in the office setting. Instead the physician must rely on the presentation of a persistent symptom complex, including facial pressure, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, hyposmia, and fever [47] . The treatment guidelines for sinusitis have generally been directed at reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics for viral respiratory infections [48] .

A study of emergency room patients who had symptoms of sinusitis [57] , some for more than 30 days, found an increased likelihood of ABRS (with purulent sinus aspirate, not cultured) in those who had unilateral predominate purulent nasal discharge and unilateral predominate facial pain by history, bilateral purulent nasal discharge, and pus in the nasal cavity.

In particular, mucosal thickening lacks specificity as a finding in ABRS, and is no more predictive than clinical judgment. Patients who had either complete sinus opacification or air fluid levels benefited from treatment for ABRS with amoxicillin [58] . These findings have relatively high specificity, approximately 85% and 80% respectively. The sensitivity of a radiographic negative for these three findings is about 90%, and the normal study can be powerful evidence for excluding ABRS [45, 49] . Management guidelines exclude radiography from the routine evaluation of sinusitis in both children and adults [47] [48] [49] . CT has the ability to visualize the paranasal sinuses and the osteomeatal complex, the anatomic entity central to the diagnosis of ABRS. Lindbaek and colleagues [59] found no difference in outcomes for patients who had a clinical diagnosis of sinusitis, but only mucosal thickening on CT treated with either amoxicillin or placebo. In patients undergoing CT examination for reasons other than sinusitis but who had a history of recent URI, 31% were found to have sinus abnormalities [60] . The changes seen in CT examination are not sufficiently specific for sinusitis, and CT should be used carefully and within the clinical context. When surgical management is being considered, as in cases of persistent infection or complicated infections, CT may be indicated in planning therapy [49, 61] .",

Antibiotics are reserved for those who have severe or persistent symptoms of more than 7 days. It is surmised that the modest improvements seen in the studies using relatively nonspecific standards (clinical or radiographic) were caused by the inclusion of patients who have no bacterial infections. The agent with the narrowest spectrum active against the likely pathogens is recommended, and amoxicillin is preferred. The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery recommends initial therapy of adults who have mild disease and who have not received antibiotics in the previous 4 to 6 weeks with first-line agents such as amoxicillin. Those who have mild disease but antibiotic use in the previous 4 to 6 weeks or moderate disease are treated with second-line agents, including fluoroquinolones. Failure to respond after 72 hours of therapy should prompt a re-evaluation of therapy [47] . Likewise, for the treatment of children, severity of disease and prior treatment with antibiotics determine therapy choice, excluding fluoroquinolones. Efficacy is predicted according to a mathematical model based on the expected pathogens, spontaneous resolution rates, and in vitro activity. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends antibiotic therapy for children who have sinusitis meeting the clinical definition and whose symptoms are severe or persistent [49] . Amoxicillin is recommended at usual doses (45 mg/kg) in two divided doses for children who have mild to moderate disease and who do not attend day care and have not recently been treated with antibiotics. Failure to improve (reduction in respiratory symptoms and in general well-being) within 48 to 72 hours should lead to reconsideration of the diagnosis or changes in therapy. High-dose amoxicillin (90 mg/kg) is advised if patients fail to improve with usual doses of amoxicillin, have moderate to severe illness, have been recently treated with antibiotics, or attend day care. Alternatives for b-lactam allergic patients include cefdinir, cefuroxime, or cefpodoxime. Clarithromycin and azithromycin are recommended in anaphylaxis-type, b-lactam allergic patients.",

The addition of intranasal steroids to antibiotic therapy for acute rhinosinusitis in patients who had [68] and did not have [69] a history of chronic or recurrent sinus symptoms achieved a higher and more rapid rate of patient-reported clinical success than placebo.",

This reflects hypersensitivity of the bronchial epithelium that can be measured by pulmonary function testing, with abnormalities most prominent 1 or more weeks after infection [71] . These abnormalities typically persist for 2 to 3 weeks, but may last longer. In a study of patients presenting to a general medical practice who have acute cough, purulent sputum, or abnormal auscultory findings, it was 3 to 4 weeks before most patients were well and able to resume usual activities [77] . Although the productivity of the cough, and in particular the purulence of the sputum, is associated with antibiotic use by physicians [78] , this feature, a nonspecific sign of inflammation, is not predictive of a bacterial infection [76] . Established criteria for the diagnosis of pneumonia do not include purulent sputum, and only 10% of patients presenting with purulent sputum have pneumonia [71] . A rule to exclude the diagnosis of pneumonia without the need for further evaluation is based on the absence of abnormal vital signs (tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever) and the absence of specific adventitious breath sounds (consolidation signs, such as rales, egophony, or fremitus) [79] . Although this may guide the physician in the decision to proceed with radiography, other factors that may influence this decision include the age and comorbidities of the patient, and the likelihood of a seasonal illness such as influenza. The use of C-reactive protein measurement to distinguish bacterial pneumonia from uncomplicated acute bronchitis has been studied but does not appear to offer an advantage in the evaluation of patients who have acute cough [71] .",

Increasing reports of pertussis appear to be due to waning vaccine immunity in adolescents and young adults [81] . Use of serology for the diagnosis of pertussis and for diagnosis of infection with M pneumoniae or C pneumoniae is limited, in part because seroconversion may occur in asymptomatic individuals [76, 80] . Sputum culture is poorly sensitive for these species and is not recommended. M pneumoniae infection commonly produces an influenza-like tracheobronchitis with a self-limited course resolving in 2 to 4 weeks without treatment [82] . It may also produce an atypical pneumonia.
