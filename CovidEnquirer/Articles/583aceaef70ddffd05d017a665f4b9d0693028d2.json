A high proportion of zoonoses originate from wildlife reservoirs. Rodents are the most numerous, widespread, and diverse group of mammals on the earth and are reservoirs for many zoonotic viruses responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A better understanding of virome diversity in rodents would be of importance for researchers and professionals in the field. Therefore, we developed the DRodVir database (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ DRodVir/), a comprehensive, up-to-date, and well-curated repository of rodent-associated animal viruses. The database currently covers 7690 sequences from 5491 rodent-associated mammal viruses of 26 viral families detected from 194 rodent species in 93 countries worldwide. In addition to virus sequences, the database provides detailed information on related samples and host rodents, as well as a set of online analytical tools for text query, BLAST search and phylogenetic reconstruction. The DRodVir database will help virologists better understand the virome diversity of rodents. Moreover, it will be a valuable tool for epidemiologists and zoologists for easy monitoring and tracking of the current and future zoonotic diseases. As a data application example, we further compared the current status of rodent-associated viruses with bat-associated viruses to highlight the necessity for including additional host species and geographic regions in future investigations, which will help us achieve a better understanding of the virome diversities in the two major reservoirs of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.",

Two mammalian orders, Rodentia (rodents) and Chiroptera (bats), represent the most relevant potential sources of new zoonoses (Calisher et al., 2006; Meerburg et al., 2009; Smith and Wang, 2013) . The Rodentia is the single largest order of mammals. There are more than 2000 living species of rodents, which comprise~40% of all mammalian species, including mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, voles, chinchillas, chipmunks, gophers, muskrats, gerbils, woodchucks, and many others (Huchon et al., 2002) . Despite their great species diversity, all rodents share a common feature e a single pair of continuously growing incisors, which are used to gnaw food, excavate burrows, and defend themselves. Rodents are native on all continents except Antarctica, and they show a wide range of lifestyles, ranging from terrestrial, subterranean, arboreal, to aquatic habitats (Wolff and Sherman, 2007) .",

Since the Middle Ages, rodents have been known to contribute to human diseases, as black rats were associated with the spread of the plague (Perry and Fetherston, 1997) . However, rodents are also a threat to public health in modern times. They have been implicated as reservoir hosts of zoonotic pathogens, such as viral hemorrhagic fever viruses, including arenaviruses (Junin, Machupo, and Lassa) and hantaviruses (Hantaan, Dobrava, and Sin Nombre) (Enria and Pinheiro, 2000; Goeijenbier et al., 2013) . Also, global climate change and continued urbanization have led to increased problems with rodent-associated zoonoses (Mills et al., 2010) . Recent metagenomic studies have identified a wide diversity of novel viruses in rodents from families/ genera that contain important human pathogens, including new species/variants of picornaviruses, hepaciviruses and sapoviruses (Firth et al., 2014) . Therefore, it is necessary to enhance our knowledge of the virome diversity in rodents to facilitate future prevention and control of emerging zoonotic diseases.",

Due to the wide-scale microbial surveillance programs conducted and novel high-throughput detection methods developed in recent years, there are a plethora of newly identified viruses in both rodents and bats. Our group already constructed the first database of bat-associated viruses (DBatVir) in 2014 (Chen et al., 2014) . In this study, we present a newly established DRodVir database for a thorough and modern understanding of rodent-associated viral zoonoses (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/DRodVir/).

To retrieve all available sequences of rodent-associated viruses from the public domain, we first performed exhaustive searches in both the PubMed and Nucleotide databases of NCBI using a group of keywords pertaining to rodents. Then, the retrieved GenBank records were downloaded to a local system and parsed by an in-house BioPerl script to generate human-readable tables of the metadata, including the sampling time, location, rodent species, specimen type (e.g., feces, blood, or tissues), and viral detection method (e.g., PCR or metagenomics), for further review. For published sequences, additional meta information was extracted from the related literature using manual curation. As the DRodVir database focuses on natural rodent-associated mammal viruses that are most relevant to emerging zoonotic infectious diseases, the following filter criteria are employed to exclude unrelated records: i) samples derived from animals other than rodents; ii) sequences of phages; iii) insect or plant viruses; iv) laboratory-cultured viruses in model rodents. Taxonomic information of all viruses and rodents was derived from the Taxonomy database of NCBI. In addition, we collected information concerning the viruses (e.g., genome architecture, average size and virus graphics) and the rodents (e.g., common names and known geographic ranges) from the ViralZone databases (Masson et al., 2013) and the ICUN Red List (www.iucnredlist.org), respectively. Moreover, the established phylogenetic relationships between different rodent families from a previous study were carefully incorporated into the database (Meredith et al., 2011) .",

Users who are familiar with certain viruses can use the 'browse by virus' submenu to explore the current host range in rodents and their geographic distributions (Fig. 1B) , whereas those who are interested in given types of rodents may try the 'browse by rodent' submenu to investigate the known virome diversity in different rodentia hosts (Fig. 1C ). In addition, the 'browse by region' submenu allows the users to easily summarize the current research efforts conducted on rodentassociated viruses for any countries or continents (Fig. 1D ). All three submenus are organized as hierarchical and expandable trees and can be easily switched on/off by single click on the title bar. Each branch of the trees in the submenus provides a direct link to individual tab in the main content panel, which presents a uniform sortable grid that includes brief information of the viruses, specimens, associated rodents, determined sequences and related literature (Fig. 1A) . Each line of the table can be further expanded by double click to show additional information, such as virus detection method, GenBank accession number(s), sequence submission date, submitters and their affiliations. A clickable linear map is available for each full-length viral sequence to highlight the genome architecture of the virus (Fig. 1A) . For brevity, the table provides up to 100 records by default. Handy toolbar is available for users to page up/down if more records exist, or alternatively, turn off paging to force to display all records within a single table. In addition, the main table offers various manipulating functions, i.e., sorting/ filtering the table by column contents, reordering the columns, adjusting column width or hiding some columns.",

Given that there is nearly twice the number of living rodent species as bat species, the current investigation efforts cover onl\u1ef9 9% of the rodent species but~21% of the bat species.

Therefore, a better understanding of the virome diversity in either host requires the investigation efforts to cover as many countries as possible. Indeed, the current studies already include countries from all six continents. Thus far, the coverage of countries in most continents is far from comprehensive (Fig. 3C) .

For example, 52% of the rodent-associated viruses currently identified were from family Bunyaviridae (mostly are Hantaviruses), whereas~41% of the bat-associated viruses reported so far were from family Rhabdoviridae (mostly are Lyssaviruses). Nevertheless, the biased data may also be a helpful measure for the potential distribution range of each viral family in the hosts. For instance, viruses from the family Bunyaviridae are the most widely distributed viruses among rodent-associated viruses, which have been detected in 109 rodent species from 64 countries worldwide (Fig. 3B) . However, although the current data of viruses from the family Coronaviridae (i.e., coronavirus) in bats are less than half of those from family Rhabdoviridae, coronaviruses were surprisingly identified in 121 bat species from 39 countries, which makes them the most widely distributed bat-associated viruses thus far (Fig. 3B) . Because the causative agents of both SARS and MERS pandemics are coronaviruses, their widespread occurrence in bats further highlights their potential threats to public health. Also, the current data show that viruses from some other families such as Rhabdoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Arenaviridae, and Picornaviridae are broadly distributed in terms of host species (rodents and/or bats) and geography (Fig. 3B) .
