            "text": "Background/Purpose: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has a high fatality rate worldwide. We examined the epidemiologic and clinical factors associated with death for all laboratory-confirmed SARS patients in Taiwan. Methods: Using initial data in medical records reported by hospitals to the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan, we analyzed whether hematological, biochemical and arterial blood gas measures could predict fatality in 346 SARS patients. Results: Both fatalities (n = 73; 21.1%) and survivors had elevated plasma concentration of initial C-reactive protein (CRP), but the mean CRP concentration was higher in fatalities (47.7 \u00b1 43.3 mg/L) than in survivors (24.6 \u00b1 28.2 mg/L). Initial lymphocyte counts were low in both fatalities (814 \u00b1 378/\u03bcL) and survivors (1019 \u00b1 480/\u03bcL). After controlling for age and sex, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that hematological factors significantly associated with fatality included initial neutrophil count > 7000/ \u03bcL (odds ratio [OR] = 6.4), initial CRP concentration > 47.5 mg/L (OR = 5.8) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) > 593.5 IU/L (OR = 4.2). Factors significantly associated with initial CRP concentration > 47.5 mg/L included dyspnea (OR = 4.3), red blood cell count < 4.1 \u00d7 10 6 /\u03bcL (OR = 4.3) and serum aspartate aminotransferase > 57 IU/L (OR = 3.1). Conclusion: Initial neutrophil count, CRP and LDH levels are important predictors of mortality from SARS. [J Formos Med Assoc 2006;105(6):439-450] ",

Mean concentrations and SD were calculated as well. The risk of elevated initial CRP for each potentially associated factor was estimated with OR and corresponding 95% CI with all variables categorized. Consideration of various CRP cut-off values revealed that more variables were significantly associated with CRP at the cut-off value of 47.5 mg/L (75 th percentile) than 5 mg/L (normal value) or 29.1 mg/L (mean value). When a variable had upper and/or low quartile values beyond the normal range, the 75 th percentile value was used for the estimation of positive correlation, and the 25 th percentile value for nega-tive correlation. Otherwise, the normal value was used to determine the cut-off value.

These associations disappeared, however, when dyspnea, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, LDH or CRP were add-ed to bivariate analyses, except for the association with age, which remained significant. Age 60 years, initial neutrophil count, CRP level and LDH level were significant predictors of death from SARS. Compared to survivors without dyspnea, the age-sex-adjusted OR in patients with initial CRP levels > 47.5 mg/L were 6.0 for fatalities with dyspnea, 3.5 for survivors with dyspnea, and 2.8 for fatalities without dyspnea. Therefore, initial CRP is not only a marker associated with SARS progression, but can also be used to predict the severity of this coronavirus infection. The present study of 346 cases showed that the fatality rate was much greater for patients with comorbidity (59.3% or 35/59) than for those without comorbidity (13.2% or 38/287). For the 41 patients with endotracheal intubation, the case fatality rate was 46.3% (19/41) . The overall case fatality rate from SARS in Taiwan was slightly higher than that in a medical center reported by Wang et al, 22 but much higher than the WHO reported average fatality rates of 10.9% worldwide, 14% in Singapore and 16% in Canada. 4 The high proportion of hospital-associated infection during the outbreak period may explain the elevated fatality rate, particularly involving inpatients, as supported by the high comorbidity rate in the study patients.",

            "text": "Comparison of vital signs, clinical symptoms and comorbidity between fatalities and survivors revealed that initial hematological and biochemical characteristics may be attributable to the risk of fatality from SARS. This study had the advantage that hospitals were required to report these initial data for all potential SARS patients to the government health authority. In previous studies, comorbidity, particularly DM and cardiac disease, was significantly associated with higher risk of death from SARS. 5, 7, 13, 22 Although we found similar patterns in the univariate analysis, only DM remained significant in the multivariate analysis. This is attributable to the predicative value of initial neutrophil count (> 7000/\u03bcL), LDH level (> 593.5 IU/L) and CRP level (> 47.5 mg/L) for fatality from SARS. Previous studies also found a significant association between death and high levels of initial LDH 5, 7, 13, 16, [20] [21] [22] and CRP. 12, 22 Death is thus more likely to occur in patients with these conditions. Consistent with previous studies, we found that older patients were more likely to have higher LDH and neutrophil count. 5, 7, 16, 20, 21 Both CRP and LDH are markers of inflammation. Initial LDH level was also an independent predictor of death in this study, but not in the study of Wang et al. 22 Our study included a nationwide sample of a much larger size than their single hospital study. Previous studies found strong evidence of an elevated risk for developing adverse outcomes or acute respiratory distress syndrome in SARS patients from Hong Kong with elevated LDH. 16, 20, 21 In agreement with these studies, we found that a high serum LDH level appeared to be associated with increased mortality in SARS cases in the multivariate analysis. This finding is also similar to results of studies in patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and AIDS. 26, 27 Increased serum LDH has also previously been associated with several pulmonary infections, including tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonia. 28, 29 Several comorbidity variables were significant factors in the prediction of SARS fatality in the univariate analyses of this study. However, only DM remained significant when dyspnea was added to the model. The initial association of CRP with fatality was consistent with the findings of Singh et al 12 and Wang et al. 22 Singh et al's study in Singapore found that 7 of 11 SARS patients had elevated CRP with a higher proportion in fatalities than in survivors (75% vs. 25%). 12 Wang et al's study at a medical center also found that 77.9% (53/68) of SARS patients with elevated initial CRP were at higher risk of fatality (OR = 1.447 for every 1 mg/dL increase, p = 0.006). 22 We also found that elevated initial CRP was a factor associated with higher OR of deaths for all SARS patients in Taiwan. The present study had a greater sample size than previous studies from Taiwan, with initial CRP test results available for 211 of 346 SARS patients. CRP is one of the most sensitive acute-phase reactants and is virtually absent from blood serum in the healthy person. CRP levels can increase dramatically after bacterial and viral infections, inflammation and severe trauma. 25 Higher blood CRP level plays an instructive role in the acquired immune response as innate recognition lectin, 30 a pentameric polypeptide initially reported in patients with Streptococcus pneumonia. 31 Furthermore, this nonspecific inflammation marker may predict the risk of cardiovascular events and hypertension development. [32] [33] [34] In the present study, we found that SARS patients with the comorbidities of cardiac disease, hypertension and CVA had high plasma CRP concentrations and were at high risk of fatality. This risk, however, was not as great as that of patients with the comorbidity of DM. High CRP has also been associated with acute dyspnea due to bacterial pneumonia and bronchitis. 35 Dyspnea was an important variable in predicting CRP level. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, BUN and CPK were significant predictors of CRP level in the univariate analysis. These associations became insignificant, however, when dyspnea was added into the model in the bivariate analysis. In this study, the initial serum samples for hematological and biochemical tests were collected an average of 3.1 days and 3.4 days after the onset of illness (median, 2 days). The mean initial CRP level was lower for the 191 cases with blood specimens collected in the first week than for the 18 cases with specimens collected in the second week after the onset of disease (mean \u00b1 SD: 27.6 \u00b1 32.4 vs. 41.0 \u00b1 36.7 mg/L). In other words, the CRP levels may increase to approximately 28 mg/L within 1 week after the disease is noted. The typical CRP concentration is < 5 mg/L in the normal population, and 74.5% of probable SARS patients had initial CRP values greater than the normal level. Overall CRP values in 75% of patients reached 83.3 mg/L for those with comorbidity and 34.3 mg/L for those without comorbidity. Therefore, elevated CRP level reflects its particular role in the pathogenesis of SARS in patients with cardiovascular events. This study further demonstrated that CRP levels were significantly associated with decreased RBC counts and elevated ALT levels, indicating the coexistence of abnormal liver function.",

            "text": "CRP is an excellent marker of inflammation but lacks specificity for differentiation between viral and bacterial infections. 36, 37 The mean initial CRP value (23 mg/L) in patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia is lower than that in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia (145 mg/L). In mixed RSV with pneumococcal infection, mean CRP values increased to 85 mg/L. 38 Approximately 25% of SARS patients with comorbidity in this study had plasma CRP concentrations similar to those reported for RSV pneumonia patients. On the other hand, Kawasaki et al observed high CRP levels in patients with prolonged fever and strong inflammatory response due to adenovirus respiratory infection. 39 Patients with adenovirus respiratory infection have clinical features resembling those in patients with bacterial infection. 40, 41 Although the inability to differentiate between viral and bacterial infection based on CRP level remains an inherent disadvantage of this marker, this study demonstrated a clear inflammatory response to coronavirus infection. The initial CRP association with SARS fatality was apparently overlooked by most previous SARS studies. This factor may serve as an important predictor of SARS mortality. In conclusion, SARS is a serious respiratory illness with a high case fatality rate in Taiwan. Reasons for the conspicuously high case fatality of SARS patients in Taiwan remain speculative. High initial neutrophil counts, and plasma CRP and LDH are important early signs for predicting death from this disease. A clear presentation in hematological and biochemical measurements for SARS patients may help physicians to provide optimized care. Early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate therapy are key to effectively combat this deadly infection.",
