The high proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation alerted us to the ease at which an outbreak could overwhelm our critical care resources if we do not develop adequate surge capacity.

Because most patients with ALI or ARDS do not die of refractory hypoxemia, this low tidal volume strategy likely improves outcome by reducing the systemic inflammatory response produced by ventilatorinduced lung injury [16] . As the clinical and pathologic manifestations of SARS and AI H5N1 are indistinguishable from other causes of ALI or ARDS, and the cause of death is similarly refractory systemic inflammation, shock, and multiorgan failure, it seems reasonable that the ventilatory management principles learned in ALI and ARDS should be adopted in an airborne epidemic [9] . Thus, the authors recommend using volume or pressure control ventilation targeting tidal volumes of 6-mL/kg predicted body weight and plateau pressures of less than 30-cm of water. In addition, positive end expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen are adjusted to maintain a partial pressure of oxygen of 55 mm Hg to 80 mm Hg. Of particular note is the significant incidence of pneumothorax reported in patients with AI H5N1, which may necessitate a cautious approach to lung recruitment maneuvers [17] .",

Others feel that over-stretching resources and deploying unfamiliar staff may backfire and result in staff infection, as well as a standard of care too poor to be of value. However, most investigators agree that there is a need to develop some surge capacity in response to an epidemic. Preparations include stockpiling positive pressure ventilators and medical supplies, adapting general hospital beds for critical care delivery, augmenting and training staff, enhancing infection control measures, and conducting preparedness exercises. To this end, many local, state, and national bodies have developed such stockpiles and disaster management plans.
