Thus, most preventive measures are aimed to reduce the risk of infection. However, it must be noted that the 2019-2020 epidemic has set an unprecedented milestone in virology research by the way open science is tackling with exceptional speediness this outbreak. The availability of genome sequences, phylogenetic tracing analysis, and development of predictive models to better understand the biology of this virus has been generated almost in real-time, allowing a more rapid monitoring and response when compared to previous coronavirus outbreaks.",
