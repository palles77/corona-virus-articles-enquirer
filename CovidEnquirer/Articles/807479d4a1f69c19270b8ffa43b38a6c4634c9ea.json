The great majority of these infections were asymptomatic and apparently quite transient in some babies. One surprising feature was the rapidity with which the neonates became infected after they entered the nursery. 3 out of 35 babies tested were found to be excreting virus one day after birth and 24 out of 65 (35%) two days after birth. From the third day, approximately 50% were excreting virus. The neonatal gut is colonised by lactobacilli and Escherichia coli within a few days of birth and it is not unreasonable to assume that rapid infection can take place with rotavir-uses. Mebus et al. have shown that bovine rotavirus will produce diarrhoea in newborn calves in 15 h after artificial inoculation. Excretion of viruses 24-48 h after birth by the human neonate is therefore not improbable.",

Only 84 out of 304 babies (28%) excreting virus had diarrhoea. However, there were significantly more neonates with diarrhoea excreting virus than the symptom-free group (p<0.05) and in the absence of any other pathogen it seems that these viruses do in fact cause diarrhoea in some neonates. It was noted that viruses from some babies were coated with an antibody-like material; this feature may be an indication of the antibody level of the mother's milk or perhaps the non-antibody virus inhibitor recently described in human and cow's milk by Matthews et al.Io We did not find \"antibody\" coated viruses in cases of diarrhoea. The possible existence of rotavirus serotypes of differing pathogenicity could also explain the variable response to infection, but the determination of minor antigenic differences is not possible with the techniques available at present.",
