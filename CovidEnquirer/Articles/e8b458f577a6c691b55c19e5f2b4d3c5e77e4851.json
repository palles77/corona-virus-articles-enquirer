During the past 10 years, advances in this field allowed to achieve more and more sophisticated CyDs derivatives opening a simple access in scale-up quantities to original and better CyD-based gene delivery systems. In addition, possibility to combine covalent and supramolecular approaches offers new venues for the design of tailor-made CyDbased nanovehicles to improve their transfection ability and gene transfer in cells. In this account, we describe our recent progress in the construction of a novel CyD-based G0 (generation number) core dendrimer, scalable to CyD oligomers by a strategy using protonable guanidine tethers and whose concept can be generalized for the assembly of CyD pre-coated dendrimers. The synthetic strategy based on an original Staudinger-Aza-Wittig tandem coupling reaction. We present an outline of the different analytical strategies to characterize CyD-ODN (cyclodextrin-oligodeoxynucleotide) complexes. Among them, Capillary electrophoresis (CE) was used to perfectly characterize our CyD-siRNA and CyD-DNA complexes and shown to be a very attractive method with advantages of low sample consumption, rapid analysis speed, and high efficiency that make this technology a major tool for association constant measurement. Finally, we present the different biological methods that can be used, in vitro, to study gene delivery, and more precisely ones we have performed to evaluate the capability of our original model bis-guanidinium-tetrakis-\u2424-cyclodextrin dendrimeric tetrapod, to deliver efficiently DNA or siRNA in eukaryotic cells.",

During the past 10 years, different nonviral approaches using macromolecular systems as carriers were conducted with more or less success [1] . There is currently an intensive effort to develop original and efficient macromolecular systems susceptible to achieve DNA or ODN (Oligonucleotide) high-level delivery and more recently siRNA in cells. To achieve this goal, two families of molecules are represented, on one hand nanoparticulate systems [2, 3] and on the other hand polymeric systems [4, 5] . Nonviral vectors (cationic polymers, lipids, dendritic polymers, polyplexes, etc.) have been studied as an alternative strategy to viral vectors for gene delivery because of their lower toxicity, non-immunogenicity, and convenient handling [6] . The fundamental disadvantage with them remains with their relatively lower transfection efficiency than viral vectors. This poor performance was also due to polyplex aggregation as a consequence of strong decreasing water solubility induced by charge neutralization arising in the association of a polyanion as DNA and the polycationic vector [7] . Some attempts to circumvent this problem have been proposed in the recent literature with the synthesis of polycation/DNA composite structures obtained by direct grafting of additional components as PEG (poly(ethylene glycol)) [8] or combination with adamantane-poly(ethylene glycol) (AD-PEG) conjugates [9] . Such modifications have partly succeeded in resolving the difficulties: stabilize particles in biological fluids at physiological salt concentrations, minimize the toxicity, enhance solubility of the polycationic polymers and increase transfection of polyplexes in cells.",

However, still, the design and synthesis of new cyclodextrin-based molecular systems remain a significant and ongoing challenge within gene delivery technology. This account focuses on up-to-date research on simple and rapid synthesis of cyclodextrins (CyDs) molecular systems and their application in the field of in vitro and in vivo gene delivery. The central theme is to highlight the important role played by CyDs, to structure the supramolecular architecture, to promote mild to strong host-guest interactions, to contribute to the global water solubility, to minimize as much as possible cytotoxicity of the vector. First, new achievements in developing different simple approaches for the synthesis of diverse cyclodextrin-based gene transfer supramolecular systems with a rich variety of shapes are summarized. Secondly, a key point also discussed here, is the characterization of the [CyD-based/DNA] supramolecular assemblies and determination of some major quantitative binding parameters as stoichiometry and dissociation constant between the biomolecular species and the CyD-based molecular system. The analytical strategy which leads to these parameters must be considered with great attention for allowing as much as possible an accurate estimation of the non-covalent interactions between biomolecule and CyD-based synthetic vector. Thirdly, considering the synthesis and the physicochemical characterization of the complexes are so many preliminary steps to design new vectors capable of better complex active principles, to increase the bioavailability, to improve the delivery; involve necessary stages for the implementation of a new gene therapy, but the most important results above all to confirm all the qualities of this vector are reached during in vitro experiments on eukaryotic cells followed by in vivo performance. Finally, we conclude with a look at the possible future challenges and prospects in the synthesis and application aspects of CyDs tools for gene delivery. ",

First discovered by Villiers in 1891, cyclodextrins (CyDs) are today industrially produced in tons from the biomass (starch) in pharmaceutical grade quality in low price. Cyclodextrins comprise a family of three wellknown major cyclic oligosaccharides which are crystalline, homogeneous, nonhygroscopic substances. They are toruslike macrocycles built-up from 4C1 glucopyranose units (\u2423-CyD = 6 units, \u2424-CyD = 7 units and \u2425-CyD = 8 units) with a non-polar cavity and a polar surface. One fundamental property and advantage of the CyDs is that they readily form stable inclusion complexes with a wide range of small hydrophobic molecules. Above-mentioned properties enable the rational design and synthesis of CyDs molecular systems for nonviral carriers for nucleotides, ODN and DNA summarized in Fig. 1 .",

Considering the literature on the subject a review covering the most exciting reports regarding the use of cyclodextrins in nonviral gene vector design was published very recently [17] . On the light of literature results, we have chosen to investigate in 2007 a new concept of nonpolymeric CyD oligomer ''bottom-up'' synthesis (summarized in Fig. 3 ) having CyD cavities regularly distributed around a simple central backbone and including a pre-defined and adequate number of cationic guanidinium centres [18] . The structure was designed to induce three types of non-covalent interactions between the host (CyD) and the guest (nucleotide): electrostatic, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic inclusion in CyD cavity. As a preliminary work was investigated in order to verify the three types of interaction reality are working with our model. Firstly, we find our ''phosphine imide'' strategy was an efficient easy way to obtain designed CyDs water soluble multipod in large scale, allowing a full control on the number of cationic centres and of CyDs cavities introduced in the final molecular skeleton [18] . Secondly, it was established that the tetrapod model was able to recognize the nucleotides AMP, ADP and ATP at a supramolecular level, combining host-guest hydrophobic inclusion of both ribose and nucleobase moieties into CyDs and strong electrostatic interactions between guanidinium sites and phosphate anions. At this occasion, an original complexation scheme was determined with the above-cited nucleotides as illustrated in Fig. 4 . Toxicity studies clearly demonstrate the cellular harmlessness of the tetrapod at a high concentration [18] .",

Before evaluating the delivery capabilities of your vector, the first question you may ask is: ''The vector which I use, can it be responsible for a toxic phenomenon?'' There are then two possibilities, either you use a commercial vector or already described in the literature (you can then take into account provider information's or previous published results), or you work on a completely new vector, and you have to make sure of its safety. To do so, two kinds of protocols exist: the first one allows you to study the cellular viability: the MTT assay, firstly described by Mosmann [26] ; the other one allows you to study the cytotoxicity: here we can cited the Neutral Red assay, firstly described by Borenfreund and Puerner [27] . For both tests, one very large number of commercial kits is available, but you can also perform ''in-house'' protocols. Then, the second parameter which it is necessary to define is the cellular model.

In the end, once we have made viability/cytotoxicity studies, one can undertake the transfection experiments. To visualize, to follow the transfection experiments, the simplest protocol, is to use marked guest molecule. It exists different kind of labeling, but at the moment the most used system and the safest is the use fluorescent probes to label the guest molecules. This approach obliges you to use microscopy techniques: fluorescence microscopy will just allow you to verify if the transfection succeeded (i.e. were cells transfected?); the confocal microscopy will allow you to see exactly in which cellular compartment is located the labeling (i.e. cytoplasmic, nuclear. . .); and finally you can even use flow cytometry which will allow you to determine, more rapidly than a manual counting, your efficiency of transfection (i.e. how many cells were transfected?). . . However, the use of fluorescent guest molecules obliges you to several checks: the first one, to verify that the guest molecule labeling does not modify the physico-chemical properties of this molecule; the second, to choose and to use fluorescent probes which are compatible with the microscopic system and between them. Indeed, to visualize the cell transfection, it is necessary, not only to label the molecule, but also to counterstain the cells (e.g. we use DNA intercalating dyes such as DAPI, the Hoechst dyes. . .).",
