            "text": "In South Africa, until recently, veterinary waste has not been included in definitions of health care waste, and so has been neglected as a contributor to the hazardous waste stream. Despite the application of, for example, the ''Polluter Pays'' principle in South African environmental legislation, to generators of waste, which would include veterinarians, there appears to be little awareness of and even less enforcement of the legislation in this regard. This paper reports on a 2001-2003 survey of management practices of the five waste contractors servicing just over half of the veterinarians in Durban, South Africa's second largest city. Some of their activities, when evaluated in terms of the legislation, guidelines and policies relating to waste handling and disposal, were found to be non-compliant. Since any discussion on waste management should take cognisance of waste from generation to final disposal, the responsibility of veterinarians as waste generators is also discussed in the light of the recent developments in health care waste management in South Africa. This study presents a review of past and current policies, legislation and guidelines that have application to veterinary waste. This is the first study to address veterinary waste disposal in any South African city.",

Many disadvantaged communities live alongside landfills, where 'picking' may be their only form of livelihood (Khan, 1998) . If, as has been claimed, that half of the South African biomedical waste stream is unaccounted for, largely as a result of improper separation and illegal dumping (Anonymous, 1993) , this then has important consequences for 'pickers' at landfill sites. Considering that there are almost 27,000 potential sources of HCW (which appear not to include veterinary waste) in South Africa (Baldwin and Ball, 2000) , cognisance must be taken of the hazards of illegal and inappropriate disposal of such waste.",

In April 1992, the 'Duty of Care' principle was added to the EPA, placing responsibility on all producers of clinical waste to not only handle and store waste safely on their own premises, but to ensure its safe and legal disposal. In the event of a contractor not dealing with the waste appropriately, the practice producing the waste would also then be liable. As a clinical waste generator, a veterinarian must show, in such a circumstance, that all of the correct procedures were followed, including verifying the waste contractor and providing transfer documents indicating types and volumes of waste collected (BVA, 1992) . A similar principle operates in the United States of America (USA) in the form of a federal environmental law in which generators retain liability for waste from ''cradle to grave'' (Brody, 1993) . Guidelines in the Code of Federal Conduct govern waste storage, handling and transport (Pratt, 1994) .",

Although, at the time of the study (2001) (2002) (2003) , legislation, regulations and guidelines with inferred application to veterinary practices existed, only recently has veterinary waste been included in the definition of HCW. Rigby's (2002) claim of no statutory definition of veterinary waste in South Africa confirms this. While the Veterinary and Para-veterinary Professions Act (RSA, 2002) provides guidance for the profession, it requires only that practitioners follow the minimum requirements of a practice (not specified in the Act) and that the use of medicines is controlled by the Medicines and Substances Control Act (RSA, 1965) . Additional but limited direction is provided in the South African Veterinary Council's (SAVC) Code of Conduct for the Practice of Veterinarians (2004), such as the hygienic disposal of soiled dressings and animal tissue and the storage and disposal of carcasses to prevent decomposition on the premises (http://www.savc.co.za).",

Nowlan's (1997) classification is similar to that for HCW recognised by the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA, 2002) , which advocated the South African Bureau of Standard's (SABS, 0248:1993) Code of Practice for the Handling and Disposal of Waste within Health Care Facilities (which specifically did not include veterinary practices). Although contaminated waste from veterinary practices does not carry the risk of HIV infection, over 130 potential zoonoses are encountered in veterinary practices (Republic of South Africa (RSA, 1993a) . Recent global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Bird 'Flu and Foot and Mouth Disease should alert authorities to the potential dangers of contaminated animal waste. Fortunately, the revised 1993 SABS guidelines (Standards South Africa, SANS 10248:2004) now include veterinary practices, clinics and hospitals as health care facilities.",

The municipality does not have disposal facilities for hazardous waste or health care risk waste. Two permitted privately owned landfills are low hazard co-disposal sites. As there is no high hazard waste disposal site in the region, this waste is transported by road to neighbouring provinces. The growth of the city's population (currently 3 million with a 1.8% annual growth rate) and economy has greatly increased its waste generation, while increasing costs of waste disposal and poor servicing of informal settlements have led to substantial unsafe and often illegal disposal of waste.

The geographic location of each practice was entered into Microsoft Excel, and then imported into ArcView GIS and overlayed onto a thematic map using a Standardisation Index.

During the study period, no veterinary practices were located in low income areas. Data collected from veterinarians surveyed indicated that they utilised the services of only one or more of four waste contractors and a diagnostics laboratory. These waste contractors appeared to be the only such companies operating in the southern KwaZulu-Natal area (Durban and a neighbouring city, Pietermaritzburg). A senior manager from each of the four waste contractors and the diagnostics laboratory was approached and the questionnaire to be administered was explained. By means of this survey, a comprehensive audit of all activities relating to the collection and final disposal of veterinary waste by these waste companies was undertaken. Included in the questionnaire were issues relating to staff training and protective clothing issued. A component of the questionnaire sought to explore their awareness of the company's responsibilities in terms of legislation, policies and regulations governing waste collection, transport, storage and disposal (Tables  3a and 3b ).",

Contractor D serviced the municipal domestic waste sector. Contractor E was a diagnostics laboratory, which was included as it removed used sharps from clients' premises gratis and disposed of contaminated anatomical parts (via Contractor B). Immediately apparent from Tables 3a and 3b is that, apart from providing different services, the contractors implemented variable procedures with regard to the transport, storage and final disposal of waste collected from veterinary practices. Some of these practices appeared not to meet legislated requirements (e.g., safe transportation of waste and sufficient protective equipment for staff). In fact, two contractors claimed not to be aware of their responsibilities in terms of the current legislation (i.e., ECA and NEMA) regulating pollution and environmental degradation. Since there appeared to be little or no inspection of their records (which some indicated they did not keep), it can be assumed that any poor (and, in some instances, possibly illegal) waste management practices recorded during this study would continue until compliance is enforced. Even in terms of protecting staff, some did not provide sufficient training or protective clothing.",

In the instance of three contractors, this was despite senior management being aware of the legal requirements of the ECA and NEMA. Several possible contraventions of OHSA were also identified, e.g., inadequate protective clothing, which should comprise at least gloves and protective eye wear (Brody, 1993) . There also appeared to be insufficient staff training, as well as poor safety and emergency procedures relating to the transport of potentially infectious material. A similar situation was evident amongst some of the veterinary practices surveyed. Staff at several Durban veterinary practices were either not trained or were poorly trained to handle potentially infectious or hazardous waste. Many were also not provided with sufficient protective clothing (Muswema, 2003) . Apart from being in contravention of OHSA, there was also non-compliance in terms of the minimum ",

In terms of these NEMA principles, although not spelt out as explicitly as the US and UK laws and regulations (BVA, 1993b; Brody, 1993; Pratt, 1994; Hannah, 1995) , the veterinarian must ensure that the waste contractor collecting from his premises is registered and practices safe and environmentally appropriate waste transport and disposal. From Tables 3a and 3b, it is evident that waste contractors were generally in contravention of some of the legislation, and so by implication, the veterinarians could be prosecuted. Unlike in the US and the UK, where policing ensures compliance in this regard, there is little or no enforcement in South Africa. Two reasons can immediately be offered. In the first instance, during transformation which began in \u00b11994, more pressing social, political and economic issues generally take priority over environmental issues. In the second instance, at the time of the study, some of the enforceable legislation may have been interpreted as not sufficiently specific to include veterinary waste (e.g., NEMA) and was therefore possibly ignored, while more definitive regulations and guidelines for safe HCW disposal (which, until 2000, did not include veterinary waste) were in draft form and therefore not enforceable. Even if, at the time of this study (2001) (2002) (2003) , it was assumed that HCW included veterinary waste, South African legislation pertaining to such waste was vague and was usually applicable only at the local authority level. Even if by-laws existed, considering that state or provincial medical facilities do not fall within the jurisdiction of the local authority, it is probable that contaminated clinical waste enters the municipal waste stream from these sources (Anonymous, 1993) . In view of this, the poor waste management practices described for veterinarians and waste removal contractors for the period of the study should therefore not be surprising. The considerable momentum over the past year or two in terms of developing policies and regulations governing HCW (which now includes veterinary waste), in which issues relating to enforcement are highlighted, should now pave the way for stricter control over all aspects of HCW management. Current revisions to the SAVC guidelines will undoubtedly take cognisance of these latest developments, as well of more recent documents relating specifically to the profession (e.g., Safety of Veterinary Biologicals, MCCSA, 2004).",

Thus, veterinarians, as producers of hazardous waste requiring incineration prior to landfilling, should have an appropriate separation and storage system on the premises of their practices. Most practitioners, however, had no waste management plans and were generally not aware of their legal responsibilities in this regard. Furthermore, at least 12% of potentially hazardous or infectious veterinary waste was disposed of with domestic waste, thereby potentially compromising the health of municipal workers removing the waste and members of the community allowed to 'pick' on some landfill sites (Muswema, 2003) . Such inappropriate hazardous waste disposal is, however, not unique to South Africa. An Australian waste contractor has appealed in The Aus-tralian Veterinary Journal to veterinarians to dispose of their hazardous waste appropriately as some of his staff had sustained needle stick injuries following the incorrect disposal of syringes (Anonymous, 2000) .",

Three of the five contractors operated incinerators and for only one could appropriate registration be confirmed. In South Africa, like in the UK and USA, incineration is currently legislated for clinical waste disposal, particularly anatomical waste, despite more environmentally friendly technologies (e.g., microwaving, autoclaving and steam sterilisation) (Poggiolini, 2000) . South Africa's policy on Handling and Disposal of Hazardous Waste (DWAF, 1998 (DWAF, , 2000 does, however, take cognisance of these alternative methods, and so future legislation might then enforce some of these cleaner technologies. Globally, incineration is a fiercely debated issue, largely because of its negative impact on the environment, with incineration of medical waste being identified specifically as contributing to atmospheric pollution. When comparing medical and domestic waste incineration, the former accounted for 30% of dioxins and furans generated while the latter was responsible for 1% only (Tickel and Watson, 1992) . In the US, medical waste incinerators ranked amongst the top four sources of dioxins and anthropogenic mercury emissions. Switching to autoclaving for some hospitals resulted in an 80% reduction in operational costs, and also improved relationships with the community (Kaiser et al., 2001) , presumably through reduced emissions and less air pollution. Although minimum requirements regarding incineration in South Africa were governed by the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act (RSA, 1993b, but replaced in 2004 by the Air Quality Act), it has been estimated that only half of the bio-hazardous waste generated daily was incinerated without polluting the atmosphere (Anonymous, 1993) . It is interesting to note that many unregistered incinerators are associated with provincial (under local government jurisdiction) hospitals (Rigby, 2002) . In the context of the present study, with apparently inappropriate final handling and disposal of some of their waste by contractors, the veterinarians, as the generators would be liable, should enforcement be instituted.",

            "text": "Perhaps the most neglected aspect relating to veterinary waste disposal emerging from Muswema's (2003) study was the poor or absent documentation regarding to the types and volumes of waste generated by practitioners. In the event of an accident, e.g., during transportation or final disposal, or inappropriate disposal (e.g., sharps in domestic waste) by a contractor, the absence of a documented waste audit system would make it difficult to identify the waste generator to apply the ''Polluter Pays'' principle. Since only 87.5% of veterinarians surveyed made use of waste contractors, this begs the question: What is the fate of the waste (some of which is potentially hazardous) generated by the remaining 12.5% of practices? In addition, \u00b112% of hazardous veterinary waste generated by the practices was reported to be disposed of via the domestic waste stream (Muswema, 2003) . In terms of the 2002 HPCSA Guidelines, this contamination renders municipal waste 'infectious', requiring incineration. Since none of the waste contractors handled chemicals or pharmaceuticals, a query regarding the fate of potentially hazardous substances from these practices must also be raised. One must assume that some of these chemicals were disposed of via the domestic waste stream or the sewage system, despite the Veterinary and Para-veterinary Professions Act (RSA, 2002) subscribing to the Medicines and Related Substances Act (RSA, 1965) . Muswema's (2003) comprehensive study on several aspects of veterinary waste generation and disposal (which includes the aspect currently presented) in a major South African city, apart from being the first such study in South Africa, has highlighted the historic neglected status of veterinary waste and has identified areas of veterinary waste management that require attention. His study indicated that not only are many veterinarians unaware of their legal responsibilities in this regard, but some of the waste contractors are equally ignorant. Poor waste management in the veterinary practices, followed by incorrect transport and disposal measures, as well as failure to inform and equip staff sufficiently, are just some aspects of non-compliance by both veterinarians and waste contractors. At the time of the study, veterinary waste was just emerging from its ''neglected'' status, with little or no legislation and guidelines specifically governing its handling and disposal. More recently, however, with veterinary practices, clinics and hospitals now included as health care facilities (e.g., SANS 10248:2004) with minimum requirements and with hazardous veterinary waste assigned the same status as human HCW in South Africa, there can be no excuse for non-compliance. Following the example of the enforceable Gauteng Province HCW Management Regulations (2004), which now include veterinary waste in the definition, in which provision is made for the ''Polluter Pays'' principle, waste tracking and auditing and most importantly, reinforcement and penalties for non-compliance, national regulations are also currently being developed in conjunction with individual provincial needs. Considerable success in terms of HCW was thus achieved in 2004. The onus now rests with the SAVC as the professional governing body to ensure continuing education of veterinarians about their social and environmental responsibilities, much like that undertaken by the BVA (1993b) and the American Veteri-nary Medical Association (Brody, 1993) . It is encouraging that the SAVC is currently revising its guidelines for veterinary practices, which will presumably take cognisance of recent developments in holistic HCW management. The Medicines Control Council of South Africa document (MCCSA, 2004) regarding the safety of veterinary biologicals will also contribute to the safer disposal of potentially harmful HCW generated by veterinary practices (MCCSA, 2004) . The shortcomings and concerns regarding veterinary waste identified in Muswema's (2003) study, some of which have been discussed in this submission (e.g., safe transportation, storage, handling and final disposal), are therefore likely to be addressed (locally, nationally and professionally) in the not too distant future. It remains to be seen, however, whether reinforcement of this legislation will become a national priority.",
