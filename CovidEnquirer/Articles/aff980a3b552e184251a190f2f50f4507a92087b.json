The prevalence of COPD differed by geographic region, with the highest prevalence in southwest China (20\u00b72%, 95% CI 14\u00b77-25\u00b78) and the lowest in central China (10\u00b72%, 8\u00b72-12\u00b72).

In 2016, COPD was the fifth leading cause of death in China. 5 The total number of deaths from the disease is projected to keep increasing unless urgent action is taken to reduce underlying risk factors, particularly tobacco use. 6 In previous studies of COPD in China, 2,7-12 prevalence has ranged from 2% to 21%, but these studies have included small sample sizes, incorporated no postbronchodilator test, used outdated data, or been restricted to local occupational or urban cohorts. Only one nationwide study has included a post-bronchodilator spirometry examination, but it was undertaken in only seven provinces and cities in China between 2002 and 2004. 7 In that study, the overall prevalence of COPD in China was 8\u00b72%.",

Trained staff from local health stations or community clinics administered a comprehensive questionnaire to obtain information on demographic characteristics, medical history, COPDspecific risk factors, and respiratory symptoms. COPD-specific risk factors used in our analyses were indoor exposure to biomass, indoor exposure to coal, and exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace. We defined indoor exposure to biomass as household use of biomass fuels (including wood, grass, crop residues, and animal dung) for cooking or heating. We defined indoor exposure to coal as household use of coal fuels (including coal, lignite, and kerosene). Measure ment of indoor air pollution is complex because of its temporal and spatial distribution within the household and characteristics of the residence's ventilation. Therefore, we used qualitative levels (yes or no) for indoor exposure to biomass or coal in our analyses. We defined exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace as cumulative exposure to airborne dust or hazardous chemical gases in the workplace (including agricultural operations) for at least 12 months. Airborne dust refers to dirt, sand, powder, mineral dust, flue dust, and smog in the work environment; hazardous chemical gases refer to gases and vapours that are harmful to human beings, including gasoline, pesticides, lampblack, ammonia, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, mercury, benzene, and hydrogen sulphide. We also used quali t ative levels (yes or no) for exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace in our analyses.",

After initial pre bronchodilator spirometry, participants who were allergic to salbutamol or had a resting heart rate of 100 bpm or higher were excluded from post-broncho dilator testing. We administered 400 \u03bcg salbutamol (Ventolin; GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK) to all eligible participants, then post-bronchodilator spirometry was done after 15 min. We measured both prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV 1 , forced expiratory volume in 6 s (FEV 6 ), and peak expiratory flow. We did further testing of individuals with a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 :FVC less than 70%.

We selected subgroup variables before analyses were done. We calculated standardised prevalence using weighted coefficients to represent the overall Chinese adult population aged 40 years or older. Weighted coefficients accom modated the sampling scheme for unequal probabilities of sample selection and the poststratification weights, which harmonised the sample structure of the survey with that of the 2010 census of the Chinese population. We categorised every surveillance point into under-developed, intermediately developed, or developed according to the region's gross domestic product per person in 2015. For analyses of COPD severity, we present unweighted estimations because only patients with COPD were included. We used the \u03c7\u00b2 test to compare prevalence. We calculated p values for trend using the Cochran-Armitage trend test for proportions. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association of risk factors with the odds of COPD. We applied four models with progressively increased adjustment of risk factors to assess region-specific odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. We calculated projections using the overall Chinese population aged 40 years and older in 2010 multiplied by the estimated prevalence based on the sampling weight.

The general characteristics of participants included and excluded in the analyses are presented in the appendix (p 16). Sex and smoking status were broadly similar between groups; however, compared with those excluded from analyses, people included were younger, were more likely to live in urban areas, had a higher educational level, and were less likely to have a history of tuberculosis. 9134 participants in the survey had an FEV 1 :FVC ratio less than 70% and were diagnosed with COPD. The overall standardised prevalence of COPD in Chinese adults aged 40 years or older was, therefore, estimated as 13\u00b76% (95% CI 12\u00b70-15\u00b72), which accorded with crude estimates (figure, appendix p 17). The age-specific prevalence of COPD rose significantly with increasing age (p<0\u00b70001 for both men and women). The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men (19\u00b70% [95% CI 16\u00b79-21\u00b72]) and women (8\u00b71% [6\u00b78-9\u00b73]; difference in prevalence 10\u00b79%, 95% CI 9\u00b75-12\u00b74; p<0\u00b70001). The sex difference is most probably attributable to the notable difference in smoking status between men and women (table 1). For current and former smokers, the prevalence of COPD was broadly similar between men and women when assessed by pack-years, and it increased significantly with increments of pack-year (p<0\u00b70001; table 2). Overall, the prevalence of COPD was 8\u00b77% (95% CI 7\u00b73-10\u00b71) in never smokers, 22\u00b76% (19\u00b76-25\u00b75) in former smokers, and 20\u00b74% (18\u00b71-22\u00b76) in current smokers. . Table 4 shows the severity of COPD, by GOLD stage. Among patients with COPD, 56\u00b74% (95% CI 53\u00b77-59\u00b72) of patients were GOLD stage I, 36\u00b73% (34\u00b73-38\u00b73) were GOLD stage II, 6\u00b75% (5\u00b75-7\u00b74) were GOLD stage III, and 0\u00b79% (0\u00b76-1\u00b71) were GOLD stage IV. The corresponding prevalence of COPD of GOLD stage II or higher in the whole population was 6\u00b71% (95% CI 5\u00b74-6\u00b77), 8\u00b73% (7\u00b73-9\u00b73) in men and 3\u00b78% (3\u00b72-4\u00b73) in women (appendix p 17). The prevalence of respiratory symptoms (ie, cough, sputum, wheezing, and dyspnoea) in patients with COPD is shown in the appendix (p 20). Overall, around a third of individuals with COPD had at least one respiratory symptom (33\u00b77% [95% CI 31\u00b76-35\u00b78]), with about two-thirds showing no symptoms. The frequency of respiratory symptoms increased with GOLD severity stage (p<0\u00b70001). Comorbidities of individuals with COPD are shown in the appendix (p 21). 21\u00b73% (95% CI 19\u00b77-22\u00b78) of people with COPD also had hypertension, 5\u00b79% (5\u00b72-6\u00b77) had a history of exacerbation in the past year, and 3\u00b70% (2\u00b75-3\u00b74) had a history of admission to hospital for COPD. Among the 9101 individuals diagnosed with COPD with complete information on mMRC score, 4\u00b75% had an mMRC score of 2 or higher, and 90\u00b79% were categorised as A with the GOLD ABCD assessment tool (appendix p 22). Only 0\u00b79% (95% CI 0\u00b76-1\u00b71) of patients diagnosed with COPD were aware their condition was known as COPD (appendix p 23); 18\u00b79% (17\u00b72-20\u00b75) were aware they had been diagnosed with chronic pulmonary disease (defined as COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema). Of all patients with COPD, only 5\u00b79% (95% CI 4\u00b79-6\u00b79) had ever been tested by spirometry before the survey and 11\u00b77% (10\u00b72-13\u00b72) were taking treatments for COPD.",

Findings suggest use of a fixed ratio might lead to more frequent diagnosis of COPD in the elderly population and less frequent diagnosis in adults younger than 45 years, particularly for mild disease. 1 Therefore, we did a sensitivity analysis using a cutoff based on the lower limit of normal (appendix p 12), which gave a prevalence of COPD of 15\u00b70% (95% CI 13\u00b72-16\u00b78) in China. Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor that contributes substantially to COPD. 17, 27 Divergent smoking patterns between men and women accounted for much of the noted difference between sexes in prevalence of COPD in China. The prevalence of current and former smoking was increased slightly in our study (40\u00b72%) from that reported in the previous nationwide survey of COPD (38\u00b74% in 2004). 7 Furthermore, within every category of smoking exposure, the prevalence of COPD also roseeg, from 22\u00b76% in 2004 to 30\u00b75% in 2015 in the group with 45 or more pack-years-suggesting that factors other than smoking exposure might play a part in COPD. Except for the lowest BMI category (<18\u00b75 kg/m\u00b2), the prevalence of COPD was nearly doubled in the other categories of BMI than in the previous survey. We noted that the BMI category of 24\u00b70-27\u00b79 kg/m\u00b2 had a lower OR of 0\u00b781 (95% CI 0\u00b775-0\u00b788), but this result could be attributable to reverse causality in view of the crosssectional study design and residual confounding by smoking status. Compared with the previous study of COPD prevalence in China, 7 the population in our survey comprised a significantly higher proportion of individuals exposed to dust or chemicals in the workplace (including agricultural operations)-from 20\u00b75% in 2004 to 46\u00b76% in 2015-and this factor could account for the pronounced increase in COPD prevalence. Although in our study, compared with the 2004 survey, 7 a lower proportion of participants had severe pulmonary disease in childhood, we noted that some degree of recall bias might have existed with the current study design.",

However, the estimated OR for southwest China remained significant after adjustment for these traditional risk factors of COPD, as well as for outdoor air pollution, climate information, and season of the survey (appendix p 19). The southwest region consisted of four provinces and one municipality, including Tibetan participants (appendix p 25). COPD prevalence was highest in Chongqing and Sichuan but relatively low in Tibet, consistent with findings of previous reports in which an inverse correlation between altitude and COPD was noted. 18 Thus, reasons for the geographic variation in COPD prevalence are difficult to ascertain from crosssectional surveillance data. Further investigation is needed to investigate and find the causes.",

Furthermore, around two-thirds of patients with COPD were asymptomatic, which has risen from a third in 2004. The previous survey was undertaken in 2002-04 when severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) began spreading rapidly around the world, particularly in China. Moreover, fewer than 1% of people were aware they had COPD, fewer than 19% were aware they had chronic pulmonary disease, and fewer than 6% had ever been examined by spirometry, indicating the real challenge for COPD prevention in China.",

For example, legislation is needed to ban smoking in public places, to replace cooking with biomass or coal with biogas, to install exhaust fans in households, and to develop clean vehicle fuel and promote public transportation to reduce outdoor air pollution. 32 Avoidance of direct and indirect exposure to tobacco smoke is of primary importance, not only for COPD but also for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Findings of a cluster-randomised controlled trial suggested that a community-based integrated intervention strategy, including system atic health education, intensive and individualised interventions (eg, personalised instructions for smoking cessation, advice for better stoves, and encouragement on adequate excercises), treatment, and rehabilitation, is well-suited for early prevention and management of COPD in China. 33 All these intervention strategies could have a pronounced effect on the future trajectory of COPD in China.",

All participants included in the analysis had spirometry with both prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator examinations for diagnosis of COPD. To our knowledge, the large sample size in our study allows us to provide the first direct comparison of COPD prevalence among major geographic regions in China within one survey (appendix pp 6-10). We have not only applied the GOLD criteria with a fixed ratio of FEV 1 :FVC less than 70% but also used a cutoff based on LLN values to investigate the effect caused by different diagnostic criteria.",

First, the predicted normative values of FEV 1 were derived from a nationwide study in a Chinese population. 19 That study had 24 centres throughout the country and included 7115 Chinese individuals aged 4-81 years. In our study, 112 (1\u00b72%) of 9134 people with COPD were older than 81 years; the predicted value of these patients was, therefore, adopted for those aged 80 years. Second, non-permanent residents were not included in the study because of the sampling design. Moreover, 8355 partici pants (11% of the total sample) were excluded from the analysis for reasons including non-eligibility for spirometry and the postbronchodilator test (appendix p 11). Strict rules for spirometry exclude patients with more severe disease for safety reasons, and their exclusion could have affected our estimates. Third, smoking status (and smoking exposure) was self-reported and not validated biochemically using exhaled carbon monoxide or amount of cotinine. Finally, we cannot eliminate the possibility that we misclassified people with asthma and other diseases as having COPD. 34 Of 6810 individuals with a post-bronchodilator FEV 1 :FVC less than 70% who underwent additional chest radiography, 191 (2\u00b78%) had bronchiectasis, 252 (3\u00b77%) had non-active pulmonary tuberculosis, and 37 (0\u00b75%) had lung lesions, indicating the possible overestimation from this perspective.",
