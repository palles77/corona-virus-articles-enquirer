Astroviruses are spherical, non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses typically 28-30 nm in diameter. In contrast to picornaviruses, which are similar in size but have no obvious surface structure, negative staining of astroviruses may reveal the presence of fi ve-or six-pointed star-shaped profi les, which occupy most of the presenting surface of about 10% of the virus particles ( Fig. 33.1 ). Astrovirus infection has been associated with outbreaks of diarrhoea in a variety of mammalian species, including humans, pigs, lambs, calves, dogs, cats, deer and mice; astroviruses appear to be host-restricted. At least eight serotypes of human astrovirus and two serotypes of bovine astrovirus have been ",

Infection in turkeys occurs very commonly in the fi rst 4 weeks of life. In a fl ock survey in the USA, astrovirus was detected in 79% of diseased fl ocks, as opposed to 29% of normal fl ocks. In the USA, mixed infections of astrovirus and group D Rotavirus occurred frequently in diseased fl ocks. More recently, astroviruses have been detected in the USA in association with PEMS (turkey astrovirus type 2) and have been shown to be antigenically and genetically distinct from previously described turkey astroviruses (Turkey astrovirus type 1). Th ere is no evidence for vertical transmission of astroviruses in turkeys or in other species. Spread probably occurs horizontally by ingestion of infected faecal material. Turkey astroviruses are extremely resistant to inactivation by a variety of physical and chemical agents. It has been reported that treatment with a peroxymonosulphate disinfectant, 0.3% formaldehyde or 90% methanol inactivates astrovirus in turkey embryo intestinal homogenates.",

Ducks are the only known hosts of the virus but as all outbreaks have initially involved fattening ducks kept in the open, it is possible that other wild birds act as vectors. Using cross-protection and challenge tests, the duck astrovirus was shown to be antigenically distinct from astroviruses isolated from chickens and turkeys and from the picornaviruses that cause DVH types I and III. Th e virus can be grown with diffi culty in chick and duck embryos following amniotic sac inoculation. After 6-10 days' incubation, infected embryos may be inert and stunted, with green necrotic livers. Examination of aff ected livers by negative-contrast electron microscopy reveals the presence of large numbers of astrovirus particles. Th e isolated virus has been grown in a chicken hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (LMH) following serial passage.
