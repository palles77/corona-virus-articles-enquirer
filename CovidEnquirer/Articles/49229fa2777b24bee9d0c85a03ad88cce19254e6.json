Therefore, it is the purpose of the present paper to show daily computed reproduction numbers for epidemics, in particular, MERS-CoV, so that we can predict the future behavior of the reproduction number day-by-day. In the mathematical modeling of the spread of an epidemic disease, it is crucial to estimate the parameters (e.g., contact rate and recovery rate in an SIR model), but it is difficult to do so due to the lack of data available for the estimation. In case of the MERS-CoV spread in South Korea, there are almost complete daily data of the spread of the disease, and we choose the MERS-CoV spread case in South Korea as an epidemic model to verify the validity and accuracy of the method proposed in this paper. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no previous works that present computational methods for estimation of the values of the epidemic parameters based on actual daily epidemic data.",

The basic reproduction number R 0 is the average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. It is an important measurement in that one can determine the stability of the diseasefree equilibrium by computing the value of R 0 ; R 0 < 1 implies that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable [17] , and if R 0 > 1, it is unstable [18, 19] . Finding basic reduction number R 0 can be done through the next generation matrix [20, 21] whose spectral radius is defined as R 0 . In the SIR model, the basic reproduction number is computed as [22, 23] , which will be used for our method in the next section.",

Here, the time-dependent parameters \u03b2(t), \u03b3 (t), and d(t) denote the contact, recovered, and dead rates from disease, respectively [22] . Now, by using the proposed method, we evaluate the numerical solution of the modified SIR model (14)- (17) . We take the same initial conditions: N = 500,000, S 0 = N \u2212 1, I 0 = 1, R 0 = 0, and D 0 = 0. The initial guesses for finding coefficients \u03b2, \u03b3 , and d are 1.0e\u22126, 1.0e\u22121, and 1.0e\u22121, respectively. Using this model, we can predict the ratio of individuals who died by disease to the infected population at a given time. To investigate the ratio, we introduce the fatality percentage rate \u00b5 n which is defined as \u00b5 n = D n I n + R n + D n \u00d7 100 (%). In Fig. 6 , we show the fatality percentage rate \u00b5 n from the real observation data and the numerical approximations. Here, the fatality percentage rate \u00b5 n from the numerical approximation is obtained by the numerical solutions S n , I n , R n , and D n . The numerical solutions S n , I n , R n , and D n are evaluated by using the best-fitting parameters \u03b2 n\u22121 , \u03b3 n\u22121 , and d n\u22121 at time t n\u22121 .

We showed that the results computed by our method match very well with the actual data of the MERS-CoV spread in South Korea. Using the method proposed in this paper, one can predict the progress of the spread of infections on the use of real-time epidemic data, so that proper control policies can be performed in an appropriate time for reducing the spread of the infections. As future research, the methodology introduced in this paper can be applied to various diseases with other epidemic spreading models.
