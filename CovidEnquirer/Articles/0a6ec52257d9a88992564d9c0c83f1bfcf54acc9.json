In MHV-4-infected Lewis rats, a late occurring demyelinating disease, with perivascular inflammation and cellular infiltration, can be found (Wantanabe et al., 1983) . It is characterized by myelin-reactive lymphocytes and increased class II major histocompatibility (MHC) antigen expression on astrocytes. In studies investigating the immune mechanisms involved in virus-induced demyelination, Massa et al. (1986 Massa et al. ( , 1987a , demonstrated the ability of MHV-4 to directly induce Ia (class II) antigen expression on Lewis rat astrocytes in vitro. Astrocytes are also able to function in antigen presentation to myelin-reactive lymphocytes (Fontana et al., 1984) . In contrast, in the C57BL/6 mouse, Suzumura et al. (1986) showed that a related coronavirus yielding demyelination, MHV-A59, induced class I, but not class II, MHC antigens on mouse astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. They postulated that this could lead to a virus-induced cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated mechanism of demyelination following MHV infection.",

Cytopathic effects, and the degree of expression of class I and class II MHC antigens, were examined after MHV-4 infection of cerebral endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate that following MHV-4 infection, there was differential modulation of the H-2K and H-2D class I molecules on brain endothelial cells derived from BALB/c, but not SJL, B10.S and (BALB/c \u00d7 SJL) F1 mice, in which parallel modulation occurred.

Briefly, mouse brain tissue was minced and homogenized with a dounce homogenizer in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The homogenate was then sequentially passed through 110 /~m and 55 /~m Nitex screens. Capillaries were washed off the second screen, and sedimented through 6% bovine serum albumin by centrifugation at 200 x g for 2.5 rain. Capillaries were plated onto 0.1% gelatin-coated plates, and the endothelial cells grew out in about 10 days. Long-term cell lines were established from these initial outgrowths using a modified Lewis medium. This consists of Medium 199 with 20% fetal bovine serum and additional supplements that include basal medium Eagle (BME) amino acids, BME vitamins, glutamine (Gibco), Bacto-peptone (Difco) and penicillin/streptomycin. Fat pad-derived endothelial cells were isolated as described by Wagner and Mathews (1975) . Mouse epididymal fat pads were treated with 0.2% collagenase for 40 rain at 37\u00b0C. The resulting slurry was then centrifuged at 100 x g for 10 rain. The adipocytes separated from the capillaries during centrifugation, floating to the top. A pellet of capillaries was obtained. Further purification was achieved by velocity sedimentation on 6% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), that removes most single cells (fibroblasts and macrophages). The pellets of capillary cells were plated in the same medium described above for cerebral endothelial cells. Endothelial cells spread out from the capillary explants and primary cultures thus obtained were used for the virus infection studies.",

This suggestion is also supported by the observation of upregulation of H-2K on (BALB/c x SJL) F1 brain endothelial cells, which thus follows the SJL pattern of MHC modulation, but the BALB/c pattern of MHV susceptibility (Knobler et al., 1981) .

This is because antibodies to three separate determinants (H-2K d, H-2D a and I-A d) were used and produced divergent rather than identical results on cells from BALB/c mice. Identical results, demonstrating a uniform increase of all three determinants, would have been expected on these cells if our findings were due to non-specific binding to increased numbers of Fc receptors present. The effects of MHV-4 on differential modulation of MHC class I expression do not appear to be due to production of a soluble factor induced by infection, as suggested in the studies of Suzumura et al. (1986 Suzumura et al. ( , 1988 , using astrocytes. Although this possibility has not yet been completely ruled out, it is considered less likely in the present experiments. This is because the response was confined to BALB/c brain and fat pad endothelial cells, and was not found with MHV-4infected SJL, (BALB/c x SJL) F1 and B10.S brain endothelial cells, or MHV-4-infected BALB/c, B10.S or SJL astrocytes (Joseph et al., in preparation).

Fibroblasts infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) show increased class I MHC expression, which correlates with increased susceptibility to lysis by specific cytotoxic lympho-cytes (CTL).

We will determine if MHV-4-infected endothelial ceils can serve as targets for an MHV-specific CTL response. CTL activity against virus-infected cells may have damaging effects on the host. For instance, if CTLs lyse virus-infected BBB endothelial cells, the resulting damage may more readily permit virus entry into the brain.

Therefore, the absence of a late immune-mediated demyelinating disease in the mouse following MHV-4 infection may in part reflect the failure of induction of class II MHC antigens on brain endothelial cells, and astrocytes (Joseph et al., in preparation) after exposure to this virus. It is presently unclear whether exposure to gamma interferon can enhance the expression of MHC class II antigens following MHV-4 infection of mouse brain endothelial cells, in a fashion similar to the enhancement of class II antigen expression on rat astrocytes exposed to measles virus and tumor necrosis factor (Massa et al., 1987b) . This is presently being investigated.",

We have also demonstrated that no change occurs in class II expression on these mouse cells following MHV-4 infection, although class II expression on these cells is regulated by gamma interferon. In all other strains examined, i.e., B10.S, SJL and (BALB/c \u00d7 SJL) F1, we observed an increase in the number of cells expressing both H-2K and H-2D antigens. The role of MHC antigen modulation in the immune response to MHV-4 is currently being investigated by examining virus-specific CTL activity using endothelial cells as targets.",
