Here we report on our finding that replacing MA with NC results in the production of wild type (wt)-level RNA and virus-like particles (VLPs). In contrast, constructs containing MA as a substitute for NC are markedly defective in VLP production and form virions with lower densities than wt, even though their RNA content is over 50% that of wt level. We also noted that a \u0394MN mutant lacking both MA and NC produces a relatively higher amount of VLPs than those in which MA was substituted for NC. Although \u0394MN contains approximately 30% the RNA of wt, it still exhibits virion densities equal (or very similar) to those of wt. The data suggest that neither NC nor RNA are major virion density determinants. Furthermore, we noted that NC(ZIP)-a NC replacement with a leucine zipper dimerization motif-produces VLPs as efficiently as wt. However, the markedly reduced assembly efficiency of NC(ZIP) is associated with the formation of VLPs with densities slightly lower than those of wt following MA removal, suggesting that (a) MA is required to help the inserted leucine zipper motif perform efficient Gag multimerization, and (b) MA plays a role in the virus assembly process.",

The proteolytic processing of Pr55gag yields matrix (MA; p17), capsid (CA; p24), nucleocapsid (NC; p7), p6, and two spacer peptides (SP1 and SP2) that separate NC from CA and p6, respectively (Swanstrom and Wills, 1997) .

Blocking myristylation by Gly substitution or mutations in downstream basic residues can markedly impair Gag membrane binding or plasma membrane targeting, resulting in blocked virus particle production (Bryant and Ratner, 1990; Freed et al., 1994; Ono and Freed, 1999; Ono et al., 2000a,b; Yuan et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 1994) . The assembly domain involved in intermolecular interactions during Gag multimerization is largely located in the C-terminal domain of CA and the downstream NC region, and most mutations introduced into these regions can significantly impair virus particle assembly. The release of virus particles from plasma membrane is mediated by the late (L) domain located within p6 (Gottlinger et al., 1991; Huang et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "NC contains an I (\"interaction\") domain. Since the removal of NC or the I domain results in either diminished virus production or the production of virions with densities below that of wt virions, the I domain is believed to facilitate tight Gag packing by promoting protein-protein interaction (Bennett et al., 1993; Ott et al., 2003) . Besides contributing to Gag multimerization, HIV-1 NC is thought to play a key role in mediating viral RNA packaging (Berkowitz et al., 1995; Cimarelli et al., 2000; Gorelick et al., 1993; Poon et al., 1996) . However, NC-dependent RNA incorporation is not essential for retrovirus assembly, since a foreign protein sequence or leucine zipper motif that does not associate with RNA can serve as NC substitutes to restore VLP production to wt levels (Johnson et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 1998) . Furthermore, the neutralization of the highly positive NC charge by substitute mutations results in significant reductions of virus-associated RNA with no major effects on HIV-1 assembly and budding (Wang and Aldovini, 2002; Wang et al., 2004) . This strongly suggests that the presence of viral RNA is not important to the HIV-1 assembly process. Other researchers believe that Gag can package non-viral RNA via Gag-RNA interaction through the MA or NC (Ott et al., 2005; Purohit et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2003) . In addition to explaining (at least in part) why VLPs can still form under some circumstances following NC removal, this suggestion agrees with the proposal that RNA is an essential structural element of retroviral cores (Muriaux et al., 2001) . A number of studies have shown that recombinant or naturally expressed HIV-1 MA can form trimers (Hill et al., 1996; Massiah et al., 1994) or hexamers (Alfadhli et al., 2007) , suggesting that MA possesses a self-interaction property in addition to playing a role in RNA packaging. It has also been demonstrated that either HIV or SIV MA expression alone is capable of producing VLPs (Gonzalez et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1999) . These findings suggest that MA is somewhat similar to NC in its self-association characteristic and the possibility that it promotes Gag multimerization. Here we report our findings that MA (as a substitute for NC) is incapable of repairing the assembly defect incurred by the NC deletion mutation, even though it does retain its RNA packaging function. Our results indicate that RNA packaging is insufficient by itself for efficient VLP assembly, and further suggest that the appropriate positioning of MA and NC is crucial to virus assembly.",

Our results indicate that neither VLP budding nor VLP processing was significantly affected following the removal of the MA central globular domain (\u0394MA, Fig. 2A, lane 4) or the insertion of NC into the deleted MA region (NCII, lane 5). In contrast, mutations involving either the removal of NC (\u0394NC, NC/\u0394NC, \u0394MN) or the replacement of NC with MA (MAII, NC/MA, \u0394MA/MA) markedly affected VLP production (lanes 3 and 6-10). The PR-mediated Gag processing of mutants NC/\u0394NC and NC/MA was also significantly defectivespecifically, their cellular and VLP-associated p24gag were both barely detectable. A simple explanation for the impaired Gag processing is mutation-induced conformational changes that block cleavage sites from accessing the PR. However, in the cases of \u0394NC and MAII, substantial amounts of cellular p24gag were observed but VLP-associated p24gag was barely detected, with unprocessed mutant precursors representing the major Gag species in the medium samples (lanes 3 and 6 vs. lanes 13 and 16). A plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that mutant VLPs containing processed Gag are unstable and tend to disassemble once plasma membrane budding occurs. Similar phenotypes have been observed with some HIV-1 NC mutants (Dawson and Yu, 1998; Wang et al., 2004) .",

Our results (Figs. 2B and C) suggest that PR inactivation does not significantly improve VLP production: all mutants lacking an intact NC domain produced VLPs at levels less than 50% that of wt, with MAII, NC/MA, NC/\u0394NC, and \u0394MA/MA all producing less than 20% of wt. In other words, MA as a substitute for NC fails to rescue the NC deletion assembly defect, regardless of whether or not a NC is present in the deleted MA region. Further, the results suggest that the specific position of NC is crucial to virus assembly. Note that \u0394MN was capable of assembling and releasing VLPs at a slightly higher level than those mutants having a MA or NC inserted at the deleted NC or MA region (Figs. 2A and B, lane 10 vs. lanes 6-9). This suggests that Gag multimerization, which is primarily driven by the CA-SP1 sequence, may be somewhat disturbed following the repositioning of MA (or NC) in the deleted NC (or MA) region. Steric hindrance induced by the repositioned MA or NC is a possible explanation for the impaired Gag assembly.",

A non-myristylated mutant (myr\u2212) previously shown as being severely defective in membrane binding and incapable of directing VLP assembly and budding (Bryant and Ratner, 1990 ) served as a control. As expected, poor myr\u2212 Gag cell membrane binding was observedthat is, approximately 20% of total cellular Gag was membraneassociated, compared to over 70% of wt Gag (Fig. 3) . Results from a statistical analysis indicate that all mutants whose mutations involved a deletion of NC or a replacement of NC with MA exhibited significantly lower membrane binding ability compared to wt (Fig. 3B) . The exception to this rule is \u0394MN, which did not show a significantly reduced membrane binding capacity compared with wt (p = 0.07). For most mutants, their reduced membrane binding capacities may partly account for their defects in VLP assembly and budding. Remarkably, the NCII showed a membrane binding capacity higher than that of wt at a statistically significant level, demonstrating a good correlation between Gag assembly and membrane binding ability. \u0394MA contains a replacement of 106 codons by 4 codons, with myristylation and MA/CA cleavage signal retained. Ten HIV-1 NC residues remain in the deleted region of \u0394NC. Arrows indicate SP1-NC and NC-SP2 junction sites. Remaining HIV-1 NC residues in deleted regions are underlined. Italics indicate altered or foreign amino acid residues inserted at junctions. MA sequence inserted in deleted NC region consists of 100 residues (codons 18 to 117). Mutant capabilities for directing VLP assembly and release are summarized as follows: ++++, release efficiency comparable to wt (\u226790% of wt); +++, efficiency 70-90% of wt; ++, efficiency 40-70% of wt; +, efficiency below 20% of wt.",

Accordingly, all of these mutations may affect Gag multimerization. We tested this possibility by subjecting intracellular wt and mutant Gag proteins to velocity sedimentation analyses. Negative controls were a nonmyristylated (myr\u2212) Gag mutant (severely defective in membrane binding and incapable of producing VLPs) and the myristylated but severely assembly-defective F168A mutant, which contains an alanine substitution at Phe168 of HIV-1 CA (Chang et al., 2007) . Our data indicate that most of the wt Gag proteins were recovered at fractions 3 and 4 (Fig. 4 , top panel). In contrast, the majority of myr\u2212 Gag and nearly one-half of the F168A Gag sedimented at fractions 1 and 2 (Fig. 4 , bottom two panels). These results agree with the idea that Gag membrane binding is required for higher-order assembly product formation. With one exception, all of the MA and NC mutants displayed sedimentation profiles similar to that of wt, suggesting that most of them are capable of some degree of self-association despite being defective in VLP assembly. The exception was MAII, which had noticeable portions of recovered Gag sedimented at fractions 1 and 2 (referred to as low-order oligomers). Similar results were observed in repeat independent experiments. Results from a combination of densitometric and statistical analyses indicate that MAII had significantly higher amounts of low-order assembly products compared to wt (p = 0.2), suggesting that self-association was more significantly impaired in MAII than in the other \u0394NC -or \u0394MA-derived mutants.",

That NCII can produce VLPs at a level comparable to wt level is not surprising, since the MA region is capable of tolerating insertions of heterologous or large protein sequences, providing that the Nterminal myristylation signal remains intact (Wang et al., 2000a,b) . NC inserted into the deleted MA region may contribute to VLP assembly by promoting multimerization and the tight packing of Gag, thus resulting in released VLP migration to a slightly higher density fraction in sucrose gradients (Fig. 5B) . However, in addition to being severely defective in VLP assembly, NC/\u0394NC exhibits a particle density lower than that of wt. In addition to MAII, VLP assembly and release was markedly impaired in other mutants in which NC was replaced with MA. Although we observed that replacing MA with NC had no negative effect on VLP assembly, we also noted that switching MA and NC did have a strong effect on VLP production. Combined, these results suggest that MA and NC domain order in Gag-especially NC positionis crucial to virus assembly.",

These results, which suggest a strong correlation between Gag assembly ability and membrane binding capacity, are compatible with the myristyl-switch model (Resh, 2004; Spearman et al., 1997; Tang et al., 2004) in which multimerization is required for efficient membrane binding (Chang et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2005; Joshi et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2003; Sandefur et al., 1998) . Specific MA and adjacent downstream CA contexts are likely required for efficient Gag multimerization; repositioning MA downstream of the CA-SP1 region may cause the steric hindrance of Gag-Gag interaction as a result of conformational changes. This may explain in part why the \u0394MN assembled VLPs more efficiently than other mutants in which MA and NC were respectively replaced by NC and MA.",

Aliquots of each fraction were measured for RNA and analyzed for Gag protein level using Western immunoblotting. The results indicate an association between recovered RNA and VLPs-that is, RNA and Gag levels both peaked in the same fraction (data not shown). This suggests that \u0394MN is still capable of RNA binding, possibly via remaining MA and/or NC residues or another Gag sequence in the construct.

However, in the present study we observed that \u0394NC possesses a wt HIV-1 virion density of approximately 1.16 g/ml. It is unknown whether the ten remaining NC residues in \u0394NC contribute to virion density. A similar protease-defective NC deletion mutant that retains seven NC residues can form virions with densities similar to wt virions without the incorporation of genomic RNA (Ott et al., 2003) . Furthermore, our \u0394MN had a virion density similar to wt HIV-1 (Fig. 5A) , despite containing less than 30% of wtlevel RNA (Fig. 7) . According to these results, neither the packaged RNA level nor the presence of NC makes significant contributions to virion density. It may be that the presence of RNA can promote and stabilize Gag-Gag interaction for subsequent higher-order multimerization, while Gag packing is primarily driven by the CA domain that largely determines virion morphology (Ako-Adjei et al., 2005) . The positioning of an inserted dimerization domain in NC can affect proper Gag multimerization, which may partly explain why VLPs formed by \u0394MA/NC(ZIP) possess a particle density lower than that of wt (Fig. 6C ).",

            "text": "The \u0394NC mutation was derived from a recombination of gag mutants containing BamHI sites created at the 1940 and 2076 proviral nucleotide positions. Sequences at the deletion juncture are nt 1935-TTTAGGATC-CAGGCT-2081. As previously described (Chiu et al., 2002) , the \u0394MA mutation was constructed by deleting a fragment from nt 831 to nt 1147 and replacing it with a SalI linker. For MAII construction, the sequence encoding the MA central globular domain was amplified using the forward primer 5\u2032-GATCGGATCCAAAAAATTCGGTTAAGGCCA-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-TCAGAGATCTCTTGCTGTGCTTTTTTCTTAC-3\u2032. After digestion with BamHI and BglII, the amplicon was ligated into the \u0394NC mutant. For NCII construction, the cDNA fragment encoding the NC domain was amplified using the forward primer 5\u2032-AATAGATCGAT-TAATGCAGAGAG-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-TTCCGTCGACAATTAG-CCTGTCTCTCTGTACAATCTT-3\u2032. The amplified fragment was digested with ClaI and SalI and ligated into the deleted MA region of \u0394MA. The other mutants shown in Fig. 1 were derived from recombinations of the above constructs-MAII and NCII, MAII and \u0394MA, NCII and \u0394NC, \u0394NC and \u0394MA yielding constructs NC/MA, \u0394MA/MA, NC/\u0394NC, and \u0394MN, respectively. cDNA fragments containing the leucine zipper domains were PCR-amplified, digested, and ligated into \u0394NC, yielding the NC(ZIP) construct. The myristylation-minus (Myr -) mutation (in which the second glycine residue is replaced by alanine) blocks Gag membrane binding and virus production (Chiu et al., 2002) . All mutation constructs were analyzed using restriction enzymes or DNA sequencing, and each mutation was subcloned into the HIV-1 expression vector HIVgpt (Page et al., 1990) .",
