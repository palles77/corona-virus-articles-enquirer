            "text": "Protection of public health against pathogenic viruses transmitted through the airborne route requires effective sampling of airborne viruses for determination of their concentration and distribution. However, sampling viable airborne viruses is challenging as conventional bioaerosol sampling devices operate on inertia-based mechanisms that inherently have low sampling efficiency for virus aerosols in the ultrafine size range (< 100 nm). Herein, a Batch Adiabatic-expansion for Size Intensification by Condensation (BASIC) approach was developed for efficient sampling of virus aerosols. The BASIC utilizes adiabatic expansion in a supersaturated container to activate condensation of water vapor onto virus aerosol particles, thus amplifying the size of the particles by orders of magnitude. Using aerosolized MS2 bacteriophage, the BASIC's performance was evaluated and optimized both from the perspectives of physical size amplification as well as preservation of the viability of the MS2 bacteriophage. Experimental results show that one compression/expansion (C/E) cycle under a compression pressure of 103.5 kPa and water temperature of 25\u00b0C was sufficient to increase the particle diameter from < 100 nm to > 1 \u00b5m; further increases in the number of C/E cycles neither increased particle number concentration nor diameter. An increase in compression pressure was associated with physical size amplification and a higher concentration of collected viable MS2. Water temperature of 40\u00b0C was found to be the optimal for size amplification as well as viability preservation. No significant effect on particle size enlargement was observed by changing the dwell time after expansion. The results illustrate the BASIC's capability as a simple, quick and inexpensive tool for rapid sampling of viable airborne viruses.",

Many virus aerosols are classified by their size under the category of ultrafine particles (UFPs, with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 100 nm) as the size of viruses ranges from 20 to 300 nm, and typically less than 100 nm (Pease, 2012) . This magnifies the concern regarding airborne transmission of the pathogenic viruses since the UFPs can travel long distances (Alonso, Raynor, Davies, & Torremorell, 2015) and penetrate deep into the alveoli region of the human respiratory system (Milton, Fabian, Cowling, Grantham, & McDevitt, 2013) .

For example, the BioSampler \u00ae (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA, USA) has been widely used for bacterial and fungal collection, but its collection efficiency is less than 10% for particles smaller than 100 nm (Hogan et al., 2005) .

            "text": "To address the abovementioned drawbacks, several studies proposed the use of water vapor condensation to amplify the size of virus aerosol particles before collection by inertial impaction (Oh et al., 2010; Pan et al., 2016) . When the partial pressure of water vapor exceeds its saturation vapor pressure, supersaturation condition is established and subsequently condensation of water on colder surfaces occurs (Kousaka, Niida, Okuyama, & Tanaka, 1982) . There are three common approaches for establishing the supersaturation condition to enlarge airborne particles: 1) mixing a hot saturated vapor with the flow of incoming particles, 2) convectively cooling the airstream of the target particles, and 3) creating an adiabatic-expansion condition in the air volume surrounding the targeted particles (Vanhanen et al., 2011) . The first two mechanisms have been implemented for virus aerosol sampling. For instance, Oh et al. (2010) compared a mixing type of bioaerosol amplification unit (mBAU) with a cooling type of bioaerosol amplification unit (cBAU), and observed that the mBAU performed better than the cBAU in collecting viable virus aerosol. The cooling type did not work well when using water vapor as condensation fluid because water's mass diffusivity is greater than air's thermal diffusivity (Hering & Stolzenburg, 2005) . Thus, condensation mainly occurred on the cold wall surface rather than on aerosol particles. Hering, Spielman, and Lewis (2014) utilized a water-wetted hot wall instead of a cooling tube for the particle growth, and they demonstrated its capability to efficiently amplify nanosized aerosol (down to 6 nm) to sizes larger than 1 \u00b5m. High efficiency in collection of viable virus aerosol was further attempted on MS2 and H1N1 influenza virus using the same technique (Jiang et al., 2016; Lednicky et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2016 Pan et al., , 2017 .",

Aitken (1888) implemented this principle to create supersaturation by lowering temperature of the surrounding air of target dust aerosol. Pollak and O'connor (1955) applied this principle in their photoelectric condensation nucleus counter (CNC), wherein a photoelectric sensor was used to count the number of enlarged mist particles. Pollak and Metnieks (1960) investigated the performance of the CNC under different volume expansion ratios (i.e., p p f 0 ) and achieved a high saturation ratio of 3.50 under a compression ratio of 1.21, which exceeded the required Kelvin ratio for ultrafine particles (Miller & Bodhaine, 1982b) . In their research, the CNC successfully amplified particles as small as 20 nm (Miller & Bodhaine, 1982a) . Compared to the mixing and cooling approaches, the adiabatic expansion approach can result in an extremely high supersaturation ratio instantly, which activates the growth of particles in a very short time. This high supersaturation ratio played a key role in activating amplification of ultrafine particles as small as 13 nm (Liu et al., 1984) . While there have been a handful of studies on size enlargement of particles using adiabatic expansion as discussed (e.g., the one by Okuyama et al., 1984) , there is no study regarding size enlargement of viable virus aerosol by this approach yet.",

First, compressed air was directed to a 6-jet Collison nebulizer (Model CN25; BGI Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) at a controlled flow rate of 6 Lpm to generate the aerosol flow. A diffusion dryer placed at the outlet of the nebulizer removed the water content of the aerosol. The target flow rate was established 15 min prior to each experiment. Before directing the aerosol into the bag, the aerosol inlet/outlet valve was open to let the expansion bag deflated. This process was realized by directing compressed air into the chamber through a compressor air valve, which was immediately closed after the bag was completely deflated. Then, the aerosol inlet/outlet valve was open to allow the sample aerosol flow into the expansion bag from the aerosol inlet port to fill the bag (Fig. 1a) . Once the bag was fully filled, aerosol introduction was stopped (i.e. aerosol inlet/outlet valve closed) and compressed air was instead fed to the chamber to increase the chamber pressure. After reaching the targeted compression pressure, the air discharge valve was opened swiftly to quickly drop the chamber's pressure down to the atmospheric pressure level. Thus, the bag expanded instantly, and supersaturation condition was realized inside the expansion bag. H. Yu et al. Journal of Aerosol Science 117 (2018) 74-84 This process enabled the particles contained inside the bag to be amplified by water vapor condensation as temperature rapidly decreased due to the swift pressure decrease.",

Amplified aerosol inside the expansion bag was discharged and directed to an Optical Particle Counter (OPC Model 1.108, Grimm \u00ae Technologies Inc., Douglasville, GA, USA; size range 0.3-20 \u00b5m) for measurements of total number concentration and count median diameter (CMD) of the supermicron particles (i.e., d p \u2265 1 \u00b5m). The CMD was determined using a log-probability plot of the measured size distribution for locating the corresponding diameter of 50% cut-off point of the accumulative number concentration (Hinds, 1999) . Most commonly used bioaerosol samplers reach > 90% collection efficiency only at supermicron size range. For example, the BioSampler does have 50% efficiency at 0.3 \u00b5m, but 90% efficiency is reached only above 0.8 \u00b5m. The AGI-30 impinger, which is also widely used for bioaerosol sampling, only has 90% efficiency at 1 \u00b5m (Lin et al., 2000) . To properly assess the risks of bioaerosol exposure, high efficiency (90% or greater) is needed. This is the main rationale for using information of supermicron particles for further analysis. Control groups were also included by simply introducing the same sample aerosol into the expansion bag without application of any C/E cycle. Source aerosol was measured by introducing the aerosol flow from the outlet of the diffusion dryer into the OPC. One should note that the Collison nebulizer was the only source for generation of the aerosol and our rudimentary tests showed that application of the adiabatic expansion is not a mechanism for generation of the supermicron particles; it only grows submicron particles to supermicron particles by condensation following the cooling process induced by adiabatic expansion.",

The VPA method was conducted on the samples according to the group wherein the sensitivity analysis was conducted. The viable MS2 titer of each sample was then calculated and compared for viability preservation assessment. In order to monitor the stability of MS2 viability in the Collison nebulizer, the titer of viable MS2 in the nebulizer reservoir was also measured for each group. An additional experiment to estimate the rate of aerosol generation was conducted by monitoring the liquid volume remained in the Collison nebulizer at different times; the consumption rate of MS2 suspension was determined using the slope of the linear regression of the data points.

Based on our measurements right after application of one C/E cycle, temperature of the DI water dropped from 60\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C for the experimental run of 60\u00b0C, and dropped from 40\u00b0C to 35\u00b0C for the experimental run of 40\u00b0C. In other words, due to the temperature decrease of the control volume caused by adiabatic expansion, DI water temperature could not maintain its original value, and the temperature drop was larger at the higher initial temperature. Therefore, the temperatures mentioned in the following paragraphs refer to the initial temperature prior to compression/expansion cycle.",

As shown, a fraction of submicron (0.3-1.0 \u00b5m) particles picked up some moisture content and were amplified slightly even in the absence of a C/E cycle. In the baseline group, after application of only one C/E cycle at the compression pressure of 103.5 kPa, a significant increase of particles was observed: the largest particle size detected after one C/E cycle was~4 \u00b5m, and the number concentration of supermicron particles compared to the source aerosol was very high (> 300 #/cm 3 ). An increase in compression pressure resulted in an improved size amplification performance, and the number concentration increased further. When compression pressure increased from 69.0 kPa to 103.5 kPa, the number concentration increased 4-5 times in the submicron size range, and the largest particle size (defined as the size where dN/dlogd p exceeds 10 #/cm 3 ) increased from 2.5 \u00b5m to~4 \u00b5m. At compression pressure of 138.0 kPa, the largest size of amplified particles exceeded 5 \u00b5m and an obvious increase of number concentration in the supermicron range took place. The t-test results of number concentration of the supermicron particles between groups with (control group) and without adiabatic expansion (baseline group) are displayed in Table 2 . The results confirmed that there was a significant difference (Pvalue < 0.0001) between the two groups. T-test on CMDs of supermicron particles and total particles also proved that adiabatic expansion successfully enlarged particles. Although the fraction of particles larger than 3 \u00b5m was negligible, this does not necessarily mean that 3 \u00b5m was the upper-limit of the particle enlargement. Due to gravitational settling, larger particles might have settled (on the inner surface of the expansion bag or tubing) before reaching the OPC. In addition, the instant expansion process causes turbulence inside the bag, which is conducive to the deposition of larger particles by impaction (Robertson & Goldreich, 2012) . In other words, there are constraints in the current system for accurate measurement of aerosol particles larger than a few microns.",

However, the number concentration for supermicron particles decreased when the DI water temperature increased further to 60\u00b0C. The results of One-way ANOVA test also confirm that the experiment run at 40\u00b0C had the greatest size amplification potency for supermicron particles among these three temperatures. However, no obvious difference among the CMDs of these three groups is seen due to the large error bar of the group with 60\u00b0C (Fig. 5b) . The concentration of total particles at 60\u00b0C was similar to that at 40\u00b0C, while the CMD decreased. These may suggest that under higher temperature a wider size range of large droplets were produced. A higher temperature was expected to produce more supermicron particles as it would yield a higher moisture content available for condensation. The reason why the number concentration of supermicron particles decreased, when temperature increased to 60\u00b0C, is not yet clear. One related theory is that at this higher temperature, the stability of virus capsid reduced, which might have led to the structure alteration of virion protein (a complete virus particle) (Pinto, Maillard, & Denyer, 2010) . Meanwhile, impurities that were likely present in the lyophilized bacteriophage preparation could affect the particle size distribution as temperature varies.",

The consumption rate of MS2 suspension in the Collison nebulizer was about 0.3 mL/min, and the bag filling time was set at 10 s for each experiment. Consequently, the consumed volume of the nebulizer liquid was about 0.05 mL, and accordingly the expected MS2 titer in the sampling air was estimated to be~7.5 \u00d7 10 7 PFU/ L of air, assuming no loss due to transport or inactivation by the nebulization process.

The figure shows an increasing trend of collected viable MS2 with an increase in the compression pressure up to 103.5 kPa. Shaking of amplified aerosol trapped inside the expansion bag increased the probability of amplified virus aerosol depositing into the DI water. The results indicate the viability was preserved in the investigated range of compression pressures (69.0 -138.0 kPa). Past studies showed that application of a high pressure on a virus-containing suspension can inactivate noroviruses (Aertsen, Meersman, Hendrickx, Vogel, & Michiels, 2009 ). However, this concern applies to an extremely high pressure (> 60,000 psi) wherein virus capsid protein or lipid envelope may be damaged (Tang et al., 2010) . By using MS2 as a surrogate at a high pressure (40,000 psi), Pan (2015) observed that MS2 did not suffer significant viability loss under that pressure held for 3 min. Our statistical analysis results infer that the increased collection of viable MS2 after adiabatic expansion was significant compared to the case without adiabatic expansion; the collected amount increased as compression pressure increased up to 103.5 kPa, although there was no significant difference between cases with compression pressures of 103.5 kPa and of 138.0 kPa. Compared to the increase in the number concentration of supermicron particles when using 138.0 kPa vs. 69.0 kPa (Fig. 3a) , the level of increase in collected viable MS2 virus was not as prominent. While the size amplification did increase the probability of particle collection, how MS2 was distributed in the amplified particles was unknown. In other words, the increase in the measured number concentration of the supermicron particles did not necessarily lead to a proportional increase of collected MS2 aerosol. Meanwhile, the difference might also imply some deactivation when using high compression pressure. Thus, caution should be taken at the higher compression pressure, and the distribution of viable MS2 in the amplified particles should be a subject of future investigation.",

As seen in Fig. 6b , the highest viable virus titer (4620 \u00b1 930 PFU/L air) was achieved at one C/E cycle, and the difference from other groups (3 cycles, 5 cycles, and no adiabatic expansion) was statistically significant. Pollard (1960) reported that gradual exertion of pressure on viruses leads to an increase of bond stability in virion protein, thus leading to the better stabilization of virus. However, exertion of an instant pressure loss (as in adiabatic expansion) may cause the breakage of the viruses. In other words, when the number of C/E cycles increases, viruses suffer from frequent and instant pressure changes, causing virions to expand and break apart. The other possible reason is the change in particle size distribution. However, Fig. 4a shows that the concentration and CMD of supermicron particles remained the same for different numbers of C/E cycles; thus, the low resistance to frequent pressure change is the more likely reason for the reduced viable MS2 collection. In summary, when using the BASIC for collection of viable MS2, one C/E cycle gives the optimal outcome.",

MS2 phage was used as the test agent in assessing both amplification effectiveness and viability preservation. Results for physical size amplification tests showed that increasing compression pressure in the range of 69.0 -138.0 kPa had a positive effect on the CMD enlargement and increase of aerosol number concentration. This was attributed to the higher saturation ratio at higher compression pressure. The application of C/E cycles yielded physical size amplification, and one cycle was the optimal condition. Increasing water temperature had a double-edged effect on collecting MS2 aerosol. Increasing initial water temperature from 25\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C resulted in a positive effect, but it exhibited a negative effect as temperature increased from 40\u00b0C to 60\u00b0C.",

Regarding the number of C/E cycles, applying one single cycle was the optimal for collecting viable virus aerosol in the expansion bag as multiple C/E cycles caused the viability decrease of collected viruses. Low resistance to frequent pressure swings may be an attributing factor to the reduced viable MS2 collection. Similar to the results in the physical size amplification, 40\u00b0C initial water temperature increased the amount of collected viable MS2 virus, while lower quantities of viable virus was collected at 60\u00b0C. The results are in agreement with previous research wherein high temperature above a threshold value could lead to inactivation of viruses. Increasing dwell time from 0 s to 120 s yielded no obvious difference in the titer of viable MS2 because particles reach their equilibrium size in less than 1 s in this system.",

If the BASIC is combined with a rapid airborne virus detection and analysis approaches, the resulting system could be a significantly improved virus aerosol detection and identification system for infection control, agriculture and biodefense applications. In this study, only MS2 was used for evaluation of the BASIC. Since MS2 has been reported to be highly robust, i.e. resistant to high pressure and high humidity, operational pressure and temperature should be considered in order to achieve good performance when applying this technique to other viruses. Further research could be launched to increase the compression pressure to a higher extent, or to choose other healthrelated airborne viruses as the challenging virus aerosol.",
