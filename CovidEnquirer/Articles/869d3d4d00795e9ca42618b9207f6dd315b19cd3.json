Not all zoonotic viruses are transmissible (directly or by an arthropod vector) between human hosts. Virus genome sequence data provide the best evidence of transmission. Of human transmissible virus, 37 species have so far been restricted to self-limiting outbreaks. These viruses are priorities for surveillance because relatively minor changes in their epidemiologies can potentially lead to major changes in the threat they pose to public health. On the basis of comparisons across all recognized human viruses, we consider the characteristics of these priority viruses and assess the likelihood that they will further emerge in human populations. We also assess the likelihood that a virus that can infect humans but is not capable of transmission (directly or by a vector) between human hosts can acquire that capability.",

Many, although not all, emerging infectious diseases are caused by viruses, and these frequently emerge from nonhuman host reservoirs (1) (2) (3) . The enormous diversity (4) and high rates of evolution (5) of viral pathogens discourage attempts to predict with any precision which ones are most likely to emerge in humans. However, there is some consensus, at least in general terms, regarding the kinds of traits that are most essential in determining the capacity of a virus to infect, cause disease, and spread within human populations (Table 1) . We focus on one of these traits, the capacity of a virus to spread from one human to another (by any transmission route other than deliberate laboratory exposure), a key determinant of the epidemic potential of a virus.",

            "text": "A theoretical framework for studying the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks is well established (6) . The capacity of an infectious disease to spread in a host population can be quantified in terms of its basic reproduction number, R 0 . R 0 is defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a large, previously unexposed host population, and its value tells us a great deal about the epidemiology of a pathogen. R 0 = 0 indicates no spread in that population; this value would apply to zoonotic infections that do not spread between humans. R 0 in the range 0<R 0 <1 indicates that chains of transmission are possible but that outbreaks will ultimately be self-limiting. R 0 >1 indicates that major epidemics can occur or that the disease may become endemic in that host population. A higher value of R 0 also indicates that a greater reduction in transmission rates must be achieved to control an epidemic (6) . R 0 values have been estimated for >60 common human pathogens (7) , including human influenza A virus (R 0 <2), measles virus (R 0 <18), and dengue virus (R 0 <22). R 0 is determined by a combination of pathogen traits, such as its transmission biology, which is itself a complex interplay between the within-host dynamics of the pathogen and the host response to infection, and host traits, such as demography, behavior, genetics, and adaptive immunity. Consequently, for any given infectious disease, R 0 can vary between host species and between host populations. Infectious diseases with R 0 close to 1 are a particular concern because small changes in their epidemiologies can lead to major changes in the threat they pose to public health (8) .",

However, there are few examples of this transition throughout the entire recorded history of human viruses going back to 1901. One possible example involves the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV. A SIV smmderived laboratory strain of SIV has been reported to infect humans, but without onward transmission (15) . SIV smm is related to HIV-2. SIV cpz , which is related to HIV-1, has not been directly observed in humans. However, different HIV-1 lineages, independently derived from SIV cpz , are variably transmissible in humans, and the pandemic HIV-1 M lineage was the only virus to overcome a key host restriction factor (human tetherin) (16) . The only other examples of viruses newly transmitted between humans relate to rare instances of iatrogenic transmission (e.g., Colorado tick fever or rabies viruses). Epidemiologic and phylogenetic considerations routinely inform our assessment of the likelihood of humanto-human transmission being observed in the future. For example, there is markedly less concern about rabies virus than about avian influenza virus, and we suggest 2 reasons for this observation. First, rabies virus has a much longer history of and a much higher incidence of human infection, but human-to-human transmission is extremely rare. Second, there is no evidence that other rhabdoviruses viruses (with the possible exception of Bas-Congo virus, which represents a novel genus) are transmissible in humans (or primates more generally).",

The chikungunya virus epidemic in the Indian Ocean region in 2005 was associated with a vector species jump (from Aedes aegypti to Ae. albopictus mosquitoes) that has been linked to a mutation in the virus envelope 1 protein gene (18) . The chikungunya virus epidemic in the Caribbean region in 2013 followed the first appearance of chikungunya in the Americas and infected populations that had no history of exposure to the virus. The current Zika virus epidemic in South America appears to be another example of a transition from a level 3 to a level 4 arbovirus associated with geographic spread into areas with high densities of vectors (19) . Occasional Zika virus transmission directly from infected humans to other humans are of considerable interest, but probably contribute little to R 0 . Chikungunya, Zika and the other level 4 arboviruses (yellow fever and dengue viruses) illustrate that, for arboviruses, a high potential for spread in human populations is linked to carriage by anthropophilic vector species, particularly mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. In contrast, no tick species are regarded as anthropophilic, and there are no level 4 and few level 3 tickborne arboviruses.",

In the range 0<R 0 <1, an overdispersed distribution of outbreak sizes is expected: most outbreaks are small (often just single cases) with a long tail of larger outbreaks. This pattern has been reported for a range of emerging viral diseases ( Figure 3 ). As the critical threshold R 0 = 1 is approached, this value is signaled in the outbreak size distribution (Figure 3 ). This framework has been used successfully to monitor the epidemiology of measles virus in the United Kingdom after a decrease in childhood vaccination rates in the late 1990s and indicated the approach to the critical threshold that corresponded to loss of herd immunity (23) .",

However, genetic differences and phylogenetic evidence show that at least 2 of the first 3 reported cases of influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in humans were believed to originate from distinct domestic avian sources (36) . Further sequencing of avian samples implied that a low-pathogenicity influenza A(H7N9) virus strain had been spreading in domestic birds for \u22481 year before sporadic cases were detected in humans (37) . Similarly, detection of genetically distant lineages of MERS-CoV, which persisted for only a few months each, suggest multiple introductions from an animal reservoir and only limited human-to-human transmission to date (32) . In contrast, the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009 and the EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014 were believed to be the results of single zoonotic events, followed by sustained human-to-human transmission (33) , as shown by a single rapidly expanding lineage.",

Although the origins of HIV-1 have been extensively investigated (16) , for most other viruses, even level 4 viruses, little or no research has occurred. An origins initiative (9) most human transmissible viruses that emerge already have that capability at first human infection or acquire it relatively rapidly. If transmission from humans would require a change in a phylogenetically conserved trait, such as tissue tropism or transmission route (4), then such viral paradigm shifts will probably be extremely rare (39) . Even when a virus is capable of transmission between humans, the critical threshold R 0 >1 is not always achieved. However, because changes in virus traits or host population characteristics can influence R 0 , level 3 viruses (Table 2) are of special interest from a public health perspective, and of special concern when, like MERS-CoV, they also cause severe illness. Demonstrating human transmissibility is often difficult, but essential. The best evidence is likely to come from virus genome sequencing studies. These studies should be a public health priority (40) .",
