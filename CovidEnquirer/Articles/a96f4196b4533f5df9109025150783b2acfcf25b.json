Preparation of northern countries for EVD treatment is based on two transmission models. Firstly, certain healthcare workers are involved in non-governmental organizations that help treat infected people [3] . As health workers, they are exposed to contaminated blood and other body fluids. Thus, they are particularly at risk of infection and may develop the disease, either in West Africa or back at home. The current Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa is a major challenge for the worldwide medical community. On April 29th 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared 26,277 infected cases; among them, 10,884 have deceased. The epidemic is still ongoing, particularly in Sierra Leone. It is now clear that northern countries will be implicated in the care of EVD patients, both in the field and back at home. Because of the severity of EVD, a fair amount of patients may require intensive care. It is highly probable that intensive care would be able to significantly reduce the mortality linked with EVD. The preparation of a modern Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to treat an EVD patient in good conditions requires time and specific equipment. The cornerstone of this preparation includes two main goals: treating the patient and protecting healthcare providers. Staff training is time consuming and must be performed far in advance of patient arrival. To be efficient, preparation should be planned at a national level with help from public authorities, as was the case in France during the summer of 2014. Due to the severity of the disease, the high risk of transmission and scarce knowledge on EVD treatment, our propositions are necessarily original and innovative. Our review includes four topics: a brief report on the actual outbreak, where to receive and hospitalize the patients, the specific organization of the ICU and finally ethical aspects. \u00df 2015 Soci\u00e9 t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise d'anesth\u00e9 sie et de r\u00e9 animation (Sfar).

During the current outbreak, 16 imported cases of Ebola have been reported in 6 countries (Italy, Mali, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States). Among the latter, 7 died. But due to the incubation period (from 2 to 21 days), it cannot be excluded that some people coming back from West Africa would declare the infection after their arrival in northern countries. Because of the severity of EVD, a fair amount of patients may require intensive care. As recently shown in two reports, renal failure and rhabdomyolysis were frequent in severe EVD cases [4, 5] . Common ICU therapy, including fluid therapy and dialysis, would help decrease mortality rates [6, 7] . Thus, the preparation of intensive care units in affluent countries is necessary in order to be able to receive a confirmed case of EVD with two main goals: (i) to treat the patient and (ii) to protect the healthcare providers.",

            "text": "The risk of an outbreak in northern countries seems highly improbable because of the difference in diagnostic and medical facilities and due to the absence of a reservoir. One of the main risks of contamination is contact with an infected patient, repatriated with the disease, be it already declared or not. Healthcare workers are particularly at risk of contamination [11] . To date, no aerosol transmission has been documented, nor transmission following healthy skin exposure. After contamination through human liquids (including saliva, blood, vomit, urine, etc.), the virus spreads in the organism and replicates itself at a high rate [1] . This leads to virus particles in the blood that can be as high as 10 7 plaque-forming unit/mL. The risk of transmission is very high, particularly for the medical teams. One of the goals when receiving an infected patient is to guarantee the best level of protection for healthcare providers. The risk of contamination for laboratory personnel is low thanks to laboratory procedures. To date, 4 accidents during laboratory work with Ebola virus have been reported: 1 case was fatal, 1 case was symptomatic and survived and in 2 cases there was no evidence that the accident resulted in infection and the patients survived [11] . Thus, one can assume the same level of risk for health team members. As recently seen in Spain, despite wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), a nurse was contaminated during the care of an infected patient [12] . In Texas, a delay in EVD diagnosis for a case in the emergency department led to the death of a healthcare worker and fear of several secondary cases [13] . These events underline the importance of hospital organization and the need for informing both public and healthcare workers. The PPEs in use in our centre are fluid impermeable.",

The procedures for corridor decontamination must be known and established. To ensure that healthcare workers are efficient in dressing with the PPE, several training sessions should be planned and supervised by experts (Fig. 1 ). This implies that the hospital provides wards with a sufficient number of PPEs. Even when they are considered skilled at putting on or taking off their PPE, healthcare workers must proceed in pairs, in order to verify they are not making any mistakes. Particular attention should be paid when undressing, which is the time period most as risk for contamination. Our team was taught how to undress correctly in order to avoid contact with the contaminated part of the PPE. Once the PPE is off, workers must thoroughly wash their hands with alcohol gel.",

Surgery will expose the theatre staff to contamination, transportation of the patient to the theatre can be tricky, protection of the surgeons during the intervention is problematic and the theatre room should be in negative pressure with careful treatment of used air. Surgery should probably be limited to a restricted number of ''simple'' interventions but no list can be a priori established. One way of dealing with this problem could be to limit interventions to the ones that can be performed in the patient's room. This is another reason pleading for the installation of an anaesthesia workstation in the ICU room. ",

Inspection and palpation remain possible but auscultation with a traditional stethoscope is not possible because ears are totally covered by the equipment. We implemented an original system using two electronic stethoscopes. The first stethoscope is placed on the body area of interest. A wireless communication is established between the first stethoscope and a computer staying outside the room, in the ''green'' area ( Table 1 ). The Bluetooth 1 technology used allows a distance up to 5 meters between the stethoscope and the recording computer. The second stethoscope is used by another doctor, to listen to the recorded files on the computer. For instance we performed this exam using a pair of 3M TM Littmann 1 Electronic Stethoscopes Model 3200 (3 M Corporate Headquarters, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000, USA). The physical exam done in the room by the doctor is written on a whiteboard, which is placed against the room's window. Thus, the exam and all the information collected during the time in the room are written in a second time, in the patient's files in the green area. This procedure keeps the patient's files clean.",

We implemented a field laboratory, available in each room dedicated for EVD cases, allowing analysis of essential parameters ( Table 3 ). The device used for biological analyses, the i-STAT 1 (Abbott, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA), includes a wireless printer. Communication between the i-STAT 1 and the printer was feasible through the window, thus printed results were added to the patient's files (Fig. 3) . To prevent blood exposure, all the analyses are performed under a Captair Field Pyramid 1 glovebox (Fig. 4) . All the staff members received theoretical and practical learning for use of the devices. For blood group and antibodies, it was decided to perform analyses of ABO, D, K and Rhesus subgroup using the MDmulticard 1 (Medion Diagnostics AG, CH-3186 Duedingen, Switzerland) [25] . Thanks to this, we are able to transfuse patients in their own group and respecting the Dell, Kell and Rhesus phenotypes.",
