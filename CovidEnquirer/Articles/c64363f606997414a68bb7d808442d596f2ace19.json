One vital device is an appropriate syringe for delivering vaccine. With the potential for millions to be infected and the vaccine supply severely stretched it is imperative that the syringe used to vaccinate waste as little vaccine as possible and thus allow for a maximum number of persons to be vaccinated. Our study tested seven leading candidate vaccine syringes for dosing accuracy, dose-capacity per vial, medication wastage and a battery of ergonomic features. One device, the Flu+ TM syringe, proved superior to the others in all important categories, possibly due to its low dead-space volume and its dosing accuracy. The data suggest that switching to this device from any of the others tested would provide between 2 and 19% additional vaccine doses per vial if the current 10-dose vials are used. Extrapolations from this data suggest that many thousands to millions of additional persons could be vaccinated in mass campaigns. Use of a syringe of this type, and the vaccine savings that would accrue, would likely be important in reducing morbidity and mortality in the event of a pandemic of influenza.",

The choice of syringe by stockpilers is not merely of academic or financial interest; it will be a major determinant of life or death in a pandemic. Given the scale of need for vaccine and the limited capacity of manufacturers to supply it, shortages will be inevitable. Such will be the outcry for vaccine that officials expect major social and political upheavals [18] . It is therefore of paramount importance to stock a syringe which will reduce vaccine wastage to a minimum and thereby allow the greatest number of persons to be vaccinated.

Afterwards the vial with its remaining volume (less than a full dose) was weighed (d = weight of residual liquid and vial). This allowed the calculation of the wasted volume (e = weight of only the residual liquid in a vial calculated by d \u2212 a = e). Following the study, staff weighed each empty, dry vial (a = weight of empty, dry vial) in order to compare with weights of full vials (b = weight of full vial) and assess the weight of liquid in the vial (c = weight of only the liquid in a full vial [b \u2212 a = c]).

From the distribution of volumes from 5 mL vials we were able to estimate how many draws (under optimal conditions; i.e. where there is zero loss) might be achieved. Knowing that there was usually a 10% overfill, we estimated, before study commencement, that ideally the percentage of 9-draw vials would be approximately 2%, 10-draw vials approximately 15%, 11-draw vials approximately 80% and 12-draw vials approximately 3%.

A third potential confounding factor might be differences in the dead-space volume of one device category compared to another. The dead-space in a syringe is the volume of fluid that is drawn up but not injected; this volume is trapped inside the syringe as a function of the design of the device. This parameter was evaluated in a separate bench experiment in which 40 syringes from each of the 7 device categories were weighed empty and then filled with 0.5 mL of saline; the saline was expelled by fully depressing the plunger and the device was immediately weighed.

Officials and medical decision makers must be asking the question, what would constitute an optimal injecting device for influenza vaccine in a pandemic? We would like to offer the following suggested answers as a prelude to discussing the results of our study.",

Experience shows that by using a low dead-space device and by appropriate drawing-up technique (expelling excess vaccine back into the vial rather than into the air when getting rid of bubbles or aligning meniscus to dose line) one may increase the number of doses drawn from a 10-dose vial from an average of 8 to an average of 10. In some instances, involving over-filled vials (a common practice by vaccine suppliers), one may even get 11 or 12 doses from a vial. There are enormous financial benefits that will accrue if, from each vial, 20% more vaccine is saved; this may be expected to translate into 20% lower vaccine costs, 20% less workload for vaccinators and 20% greater numbers of persons vaccinated.",

It would appear that there are compelling reasons to recommend device 1 for stocking in the event of an influenza pandemic. Device 1 yielded more doses per vial, probably because it has significantly lower dead-space volumes (Fig. 4) . The additional persons vaccinated per million vials with this device is striking, and its use could probably lead to significant decreases in morbidity and mortality. In addition to sparing doses and 'stretching' the vaccine supply, the use of device 1 would likely mean considerable financial savings to health-care systems due to less vaccine wastage and more efficient (speedier) injections. How much this savings would be is difficult to calculate. We do not know what the cost of the pandemic vaccine will be or, more importantly, the total cost of caring for victims who could have been spared had they been vaccinated. However, if the current cost of flu vaccine is used as a reference, it is clear that the financial savings which would accrue from vaccine savings on the scale reported here would more than cover the additional costs of stockpiling the device.",
