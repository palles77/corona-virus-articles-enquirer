The IgG index as indicator for intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis was normal in animals with non-inflammatory demyelinating lesions and elevated in dogs with inflammatory myelin lesions. Specific antibodies against CDV and myelin were quantitated in CSF and serum from 8 dogs with an elevated IgG index. Eight of these dogs had significant amounts of antimyelin antibody and 4 dogs had neutralizing anti-CDV antibody in the CSF. Whereas the pathogenetic significance of antimyelin antibodies remains uncertain, the intrathecal antiviral immune response provides a plausible explanation for immunopathologic destruction of myelin in distemper.",

Later on during the course of the disease inflammation occurs in the demyelinated areas which appears to be associated with viral clearance and recovery (Vandevelde et al. 1985) . In some animals, however, severe progressive inflammatory demyelination occurs suggesting an immunopathologic process in which the inflammation contributes to further damage of the white matter. The nature of such detrimental inflammatory response is uncertain, Dogs with distemper encephalitis develop a cell-mediated ) and humoral (Krakowka et al. 1975 ) immune response to CDV but less efficiently than dogs that exhibit a fast recovery. Autoimmune antimyelin reactions in distemper have been suggested by the finding of antimyelin antibodies in serum (Krakowka et al. 1973; Vandevelde et al. 19132) and myelin antigen-sensitized lymphocytes (Cerruti-Sola et al. 1983) in infected dogs although a causal relationship between such findings and the occurrence of inflammatory demyelination has not been proven. Since immunological events affecting the CNS may be intrathecally restricted or concentrated, CSF studies are very relevant to assess intracerebral immunological events (Link 1978; Tourtellotte et al. 1978) . Only few CSF studies have been done on distemper. Older publications have dealt with general diagnostic CSF parameters in distemper (Bindrich and Schmidt 1952; Fankhauser 1962) . A qualitative immunoelectrophoretic study indicated increase of the IgG contenL~0 the CSF of dogs with distemper (Cutler and Averill 1969) and another study demonstrated elevated fl-glucuronidase activity (Long et al. 1973) . Tsai et al. (1982) demonstrated elevated interferon levels in the CSF of experimentally infected dogs which appeared to correlate with persistence of CDV. In a few cases anti-CDV antibodies (Appel et al. 1981; Tsai et al. 1982 ) and antimyelin antibodies (Vandevelde et al. 1982) have been shown in the CSF.",

            "text": "As expected, all dogs with acute non-inflammatory lesions had a normal IgG index confirming previous results indicating the non-immunological nature of the initial myelin lesion in distemper (Vandevelde et al. 1982) . A considerable intrathecal IgG synthesis as indicated by a high IgG index was found in 8 dogs with inflammatory lesions. Of interest were 4 dogs in which repeated CSF examinations, following an initial increase, showed a decline of the intrathecal IgG synthesis in the later stages of the disease which correlated with the clinical improvement. Clinical recovery has been described previously in experimental distemper Cerruti-Sola et al. 1983 ) and is associated with clearance of CDV from the CNS (Vandevelde et al. 1985) . Inflammation in the CNS in such cases appears to have a beneficial effect for the host. In contrast to such self-limiting course of the infection, some animals, such as 2 spontaneous cases here included, develop chronic progressive inflammatory demyelinating lesions; even a chronic relapsing course has been described (Higgins et al., submitted) . In such cases, inflammation is associated with progression of the demyelinating process, raising the question of immunopathological mechanisms.. Antimyelin antibodies indicating the existence of autoimmune reactions in distemper have been shown by Krakowka et al. (1973) and our own studies (Vandevelde et al. 1982) . We found that the increase of such antibodies in serum above 'background' is quite minimal if present at all. In contrast, there is no doubt that there is a marked increase of such antibodies in the CSF. Therefore, there appears to be an intrathecally restricted production of antimyelin antibodies in dogs with inflammatory demyelination, which could be explained by the restriction of the antigen(s) to the intrathecal compartment resulting in concentration of myelin: sensitized cells in the CNS. There is, however, little evidence so far for a causal relationship between the occurrence of antimyelin antibodies and demyelination in CDV infection: (1) As the present study indicates antimyelin antibodies in the CSF are also present in dogs that recover. (2) The highest antimyelin antibody titers found by Krakowka et al. (1973) were found in reconvalescent dogs. (3) One study showed no correlation between the presence of myelin antigen-sensitized lymphocytes and the occurrence of inflammatory demyelination; in fact, the strongest response was found in 2 dogs that did not develop demyelination at all (Cerruti-Sola et al. 1983 ). (4) As discussed earlier (Vandevelde et al. 1982) , the distribution of the inflammatory lesions in distemper is different from experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) and not suggestive of autoimmune demyelination. Therefore, a similar mechanism as for example in chronic corona virus infection in rats, which on the basis of lymphocyte transfer studies has been shown to be virus-induced EAE (Watanabe et al. 1983) , is not apparent in CDV infection. It is uncertain at this time if the myelin binding in serum or CSF could reflect cross-reactivity between myelin and CDV antigens. This problem has been studied earlier with absorption techniques (Krakowka et al. 1975 ) in which such cross-reactivity was not found. However, newer methodology should be used to reexamine this question.",

            "text": "In 4 of 8 dogs with inflammatory lesions, neutralizing anti-CDV antibodies were found in the CSF which is highly significant considering the relatively low CSF IgG concentrations. The virus neutralization test used was probably not sensitive enough to detect very low antibody concentrations explaining the absenceof detectable CSF titers in the other dogs with inflammatory lesions. The CSF anti-CDV antibody titers were, considering CSF/serum IgG ratios, very high. The immune response against CDV would not be expected to be restricted to the intrathecal compartment since the infection is widespread in several organ systems (Appel and Gillespie 1972) . Our findings indicate that at least parts of the intrathecal immune response in distemper can be directed against CDV. Whereas the pathogenetic significance of antimyelin antibodies remains nebulous we know from in vitro studies with CDV that antiviral immunologic reactions are cytotoxic for infected cells Babiuk 1979, 1980) . Immunologic destruction of CDV-infected glial cells could be a very plausible explanation for inflammatory myelin destruction. It is also possible that a bystander mechanism is involved (Wisniewski 1972 ). The tissue destruction as a result of antiviral immune reactions is probably not very extensive when the local immune response results in clearance of the virus from the brain. Indeed, recent studies (Vandevelde et al., submitted) indicate that the inflammatory reaction can be associated with viral clearance. Chronic progressive or relapsing demyelinating encephalitis in CDV infection could then be explained on the basis of viral persistence in the CNS as has been shown in corona virus infection in rats (Wege et al. 1984) . CDV persistence has been studied in vitro (Metzler et al. 1980; Appel et al. 1982; TerMeulen et al. 1982 ) but little is known in vivo. Future research in vivo will depend on the ability to produce chronic progressive disease experimentally.",
