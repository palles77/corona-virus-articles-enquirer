Common respiratory viruses, mycoplasma and chlamydia were negative. For patients' venous blood tests at disease onset, as given in (Table 1) , we found that leucocytes, lymphocytes and percentage were slightly decreased or normal, eosinophil count and percentage were slightly decreased in 4 cases and normal in 2 cases. Additionally, 4 days later, P1 reperformed the follow-up hematologic examination. Compared with the blood test at disease onset, the results showed that the eosinophil count was still below the normal range, which was even lower than the first time.",

The slightly thickened interlobular septa within the lesion makes it appear the crazy paving sign (Figure 1, F0, A2, arrowhead). P2 (Figure 2, P2, A1-A2): CT images showed mixed GGO and consolidation that appeared at subpleural area of the right middle lobe and the right lower lobe. The lesion presented as patchy-like morphology. P3 (Figure 2, P3, A1-A2): CT images showed two well circumscribed, round nodular-like GGO lesions (Figure 2, P3, arrow) located in the central area of the left upper lobe. P4 (Figure 3, P4): CT images showed a small nodular-like pure GGO (Figure 3, P4, arrow) located in the central area of the left lower lobe. P5 (Figure 3, P5): CT images showed a slight of irregular pure GGO (Figure 3, P5, arrow) located in the subpleural region of the right lower lobe. P6 (Figure 3, P6, A1-A2): CT images showed bilateral multi-focal mixed GGO and consolidation appeared at subpleural area of lung. Mild bronchiectasis (Figure 3, P6, A2, arrow) can also be observed within the lesion. P1 had three follow-up CTs (Figure 1, F1-F3). The time interval between initial chest CT and follow-up were 4, 8, 14 days. Follow-up 1(Figure 1, F1, B1-B4): CT images showed diseases progression. The lesions showed diversified morphology and distribution, appearing as coexisted nodular-like (Figure 1, F1, B4, arrow) and patchy-like lesions as well as peribronchial (Figure 1, F1, B2, arrowhead), central and subpleural distribution. CT images of F1 showed the that lesions were migratory manifested as the absorption of the primary lesions and the emergence of new lesions. CT images of Follow-up 2 (Figure 1, F2, C1-C4) and Follow-up 3 (Figure 1, F3, D1-D4) showed the diseases were obviously absorbed.In the current study, we investigated the detailed information including clinical features and CT imaging characteristics of 6 patients with COVID-19. Our research has some new findings on the basis of previous study:(1) The decrease of eosinophil count may be helpful for the early diagnosis of the disease. Nevertheless, till now, there is no study refer to blood tests 2,3 mentioned eosinophil, which is worthy of further study. (2) Our CT study found that COVID-19 has a variety of manifestations.In the early stage of the disease, the lesion can manifest as round nodular-like GGO in the central area of the lung lobe, which is different from the common imaging manifestations that are patchy-like lesion in subpleural region[4][5][6] . (3) The follow-upCT images showed the lesions are migratory manifested as the absorption of the primary lesions and the emergence of new lesions, which had not been reported yet.",
