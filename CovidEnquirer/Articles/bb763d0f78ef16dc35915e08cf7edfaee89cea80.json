However, schools of nursing in Jordan do not have a prescribed curriculum in Standard Precautions. Purpose: To test the effectiveness of using of an online education module and a learning contract on knowledge and compliance with infection control Standard Precautions among undergraduate nursing students in Jordan. Methods: A sample of 256 undergraduate nursing students participated in an online education module in infection control Standard Precautions. A pretest-posttest design tested effectiveness using an online questionnaire (Questionnaires for Knowledge and Compliance with Standard Precautions) before and after the online instruction. Results: Initially, subjects reported low levels of knowledge and compliance with Standard Precaution practices and relatively few (15.2%) had high scores. Compliance with Standard Precautions was somewhat better (27%). Significant differences in the mean scores of knowledge and compliance between pretest and posttest were found. Conclusion: Online instruction offers a consistent and effective method to include Standard Precautions into nursing education. Organizations that oversee nursing in Jordan have the option to strengthen all nursing curricula by mandating a standardized infection control curricula across all schools of nursing.",

            "text": "It has been estimated that the risk of health care-associated infection (HAI) is 2-20 times higher in developing countries compared with developed countries. 1 HAI refers to infections acquired in hospitals, clinics, and where health care providers are susceptible to infections. 2 HAIs cost thousands of lives each year, yet most infections can be prevented with inexpensive Standard Precaution (SP) practices such as hand hygiene and wearing gloves. 3 According to the World Health Organization, the practice of SPs includes the basic principles of infection control such as handwashing and using personal protective equipment such as gloves, masks, gowns, and eyewear to prevent contact with potentially infectious materials, as well as safe handling of sharps. 4 Experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that the recent occurrence of highly infectious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle-East respiratory syndrome, and Ebola virus disease have made the knowledge, practice, and enforcement of SPs more important than ever. 5 For example, the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus disease transmitted by travelers illustrated how quickly diseases can enter health care systems and communities. 6 Exposure to infectious material can be minimized by strict compliance with SPs. 7 Strict compliance with safety rules must be taught and reinforced as the educational cornerstone of providing basic care and preventing the spread of disease. Thus, nursing students must be prepared to demonstrate professional accountability in infection control and adhere to standards of safe practice. 8, 9 Nurses represent the largest labor group in health care and they have the greatest degree of contact with patients. 10 In addition, nursing students are at even greater risk of contamination and sharps injuries during clinical training precisely because they are inexperienced. Especially during early clinical training, nursing students commonly have contact with body fluids such as saliva, sputum, urine, feces, and blood as they learn to provide basic patient care and obtain laboratory specimens. 11 The issue of undergraduate education in shaping attitudes and teaching infection control knowledge among health care professionals in developing countries is important.",

            "text": "The adherence to SPs in most developing countries remains either ineffective or nonexistent. Research has shown the obvious: lack of knowledge is the major reason for nonadherence to SPs. 12 Developing countries yield some alarming statistics: 39.3% of injections are given with syringes or needles that were reused without sterilization. Conversely, others have found good levels of knowledge and compliance with hand hygiene, a centerpiece of SPs, among nursing students who received various types of hand hygiene instruction and were reassessed frequently. 13 Among nursing students in Hong Kong, predictors for SPs compliance included knowledge of SPs, perceived barriers, adequacy of training, management support, and influence of nursing staff. 14 In Jordanian nursing schools, infection control and SPs in a coherent instructional form are missing from the curriculum. 15 For example, Jordanian nursing students were found to have insufficient knowledge regarding SPs. 16 Although the students who were surveyed reported positive attitudes and compliance regarding infection control practices, the level of knowledge was under 50%. 16 Although Jordan has a population of only 9.46 million, 17 it has a robust university system that graduates approximately 1,651 nursing students per year. 18 The scientific, medical, and nursing programs in Jordan provide instruction in English using Englishlanguage textbooks and journals. The Jordanian medical system is modeled after the Western medical system and operates using a primary care framework. Jordan's major export is its university graduates in nursing, medicine, and the sciences. Nursing graduates can easily emigrate for work due to the acute imbalance between the large numbers of nursing graduates and underemployment nationally. Nursing graduates become expatriate workers, mostly in Middle Eastern countries, but also in the United Kingdom and the United States. Thus, insufficient and ineffective instruction in infection control and SPs has international implications.",

The instrument validity was been estimated at 0.98, reliability = 0.87, and Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.93.

The balance of the survey addressed knowledge of SPs and compliance with SPs using the questionnaire mentioned above. To assess the participants' knowledge, the survey included 20 items, with possible responses of \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"unknown.\" \"Yes\" answers were given a value of 1 point, and \"no\" or \"unknown\" received 0 points; the maximum possible score was 20. The higher the subject's score, the greater his or her knowledge about SPs. For example: \"The main goal to implement Standard Precautions is to protect the medical staff\" the correct \"Standard Precaution is only applicable for the patient with the confirmed diagnosis of infection or in the latent period of infection.\" The knowledge items were summed for each subject, and then the score was converted into a percentage by multiplying the score by 5. Based on the percentage of correct answers in these sections, the levels of knowledge were classified according to the following criteria: if the score was >75%, participants were considered to have a high level of knowledge; if the score was 50%-75%, they were considered to have a moderate level of knowledge; and if the score was <50%, they were considered to have an inadequate level of knowledge.",

Following the presentation, each volunteer was given a randomized personal study identification number to maintain confidentiality and allow comparison of data by subject. The recruitment process ended with each volunteer developing a learning contract with the primary investigator. The structure of the learning contract contained the following questions: What are you going to learn? (objectives); How are you going to learn it? (resources and strategies); and, When do you plan to complete the task? Each student volunteer was asked to describe in writing his/her processes to meet the objectives.",

This program allows instructors to develop teaching options such as quizzes, word matches, video clips, and assignment submission; video files and links; multiple-choice quizzes; an instant messaging service for intraclass communication; and other self-assessment tools. The infection control curriculum was organized into 6 modules (Fig 2) and was developed by the primary investigator who is a content expert in infection control. The main topics were emerging infectious diseases, policies and procedures regarding SPs, care of patients with known infections, postexposure procedures, general SPs, and documentation and reporting requirements of injuries and exposure. The instruction was offered for 30 days to give students a flexible time frame in which to complete the lesson. The posttest part of the study, phase 3, essentially repeated the pretest measure, including the assessment of knowledge and compliance regarding SPs measures.",

At posttest, almost one-half of subjects (45.7%) rated their knowledge as high, with nearly one-third (32%) rating their knowledge as moderate, and less than one-quarter (22.3%) rating their knowledge as inadequate. Table 2 shows that a majority reported poor pretest compliance (ie, low [39.5%] and very low [27%]). Just one-third had better pretest compliance scores; that is, average (14.1%) and high (19.5%) ratings. The posttest reports of compliance improved considerably, with high reaching 36.7%, average reaching 46.8%, low reaching 14.5%, and only 2% reporting very low compliance. Significant improvement in both knowledge and compliance scores was seen when comparing pretest versus posttest means (Table 3) .

Regardless of a student's personal career preference, those with the highest Tawjihi scores are sequentially admitted into academic career programs in order of social standing and earning potential (ie, medical school, engineering, and other sciences). Nursing ranks just above agriculture, which ranks last. There are so many men with high exam scores that they could fill all of the admission slots in nursing, which is identified as a career for women. However, due to the strict prohibitions in Islamic cultures on men providing direct care for women, rules were set in place to admit equal numbers of men and women to national nursing schools.",

These findings offer proof-of-concept for the utility of a freestanding online curriculum for infection control that could be mandated to nursing programs and as continuing education for nurses in practice. Thus, infection control is not just an issue of individual practice, it is also relevant to policy at national levels.
