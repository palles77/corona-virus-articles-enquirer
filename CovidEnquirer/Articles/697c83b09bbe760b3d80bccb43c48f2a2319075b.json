Cytoplasmic volume is usually high relative to the nucleus (Figs. 2-1 and 2-2). Hyperplasia is a nonneoplastic enlargement of tissue that can occur in response to hormonal disturbances or tissue injury. Hyperplastic tissue has a tendency to enlarge symmetrically in comparison to neoplasia. Cytologically, hyperplastic cells have a higher nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio than normal cells. Examples of hyperplastic responses include nodular proliferations within the parenchyma of the prostate (Fig. 2-3) , liver, and pancreas ( Fig. 2-4 ).",

Recognition of the infl ammatory cell type often suggests an etiologic condition. Purulent or suppurative lesions contain greater than 85% neutrophils; they are then classifi ed by the presence or absence of degeneration affecting the neutrophil. Nondegenerate neutrophils are morphologically normal and predominate in relatively nontoxic environments such as immune-mediated conditions, neoplastic lesions ( Fig. 2-7) , and sterile lesions caused by irritants such as urine and bile. Degenerate neutrophils display nuclear swelling and decreased stain intensity termed karyolysis ( Fig. 2-8) , indicating rapid cell death in a toxic environment (Perman et al., 1979) . Increased nuclear staining with coalescence of the nucleus into a single round mass and an intact cellular membrane characterizes pyknosis ( Fig. 2-9 ), a slow, progressive change often within a relatively nontoxic environment. An end stage of cell death, termed karyorrhexis, may be seen cytologically as the result of pyknosis of hypersegmented nuclei ( Fig. 2-10 ). Degenerate neutrophils predominate in bacterial infections, particularly gram-negative types. Under septic conditions, bacteria may be found intracellularly ( Fig. 2-11) .",
