The themes emergent from the interviews, and explored in the results above, are interrelated. For example, the vast amount of information, which was constantly changing and sometimes contradictory, developed a dynamic of mistrust among hospital staff which then influenced their engagement with training exercises. This was further reinforced when the logics of training (i.e. PPE procedures) were viewed as incommensurable with the environment within which care was to be provided. In this study, we can see the dynamics of communication influencing the forms of staff engagement with training which then combines with structural/environmental impediments to create the 'perfect storm' of variables (thus limiting Ebola preparedness). Understanding the interplay of risk perception, the idiosyncrasies of localised environments, and the influence of these factors on the implementation of 'best practice' at the clinical coalface is critical for successful preparedness planning in the future.",

Similar findings have also been found in Canada, which concluded that a single point of reference within an organisation to facilitate knowledge transfer would assist in overcoming the mistrust of frontline staff related to training and preparedness. 18 The conflicting messages conferred to participants in this study were broader than the local health service and included messages from higher level organisational and government bodies. There was also significant media coverage in Australia which emphasised the domestic risk with extensive coverage of every possible Ebola patient. 19 For instance, in the United States, it was documented that the language around Ebola changed from 'outbreak' to 'epidemic' after the latter was used in a speech by President Obama. 19 The authors suggest that even subtle changes in language can increase perceptions of risk. The effect of inconsistent communication on trust and engagement should be considered by public health and government bodies as well as frontline health services.",

This study provides insights into the challenges of effective training and training efficacy feedback, which are likely to have broader relevance than Ebola, and indeed than infection control training.

This study suggests that rigorous control and consistency of information flow from a government, to health service, to local clinician level, with increased resources for staff likely to be involved in direct patient care, and feedback from clinicians as to training effectiveness, would have been effective in increasing the confidence of frontline clinical staff to manage a patient with an infectious threat such as Ebola. The overwhelming nature of preparedness training and the fear and frustration it produces suggests that infection control training including the context of different infections such as Ebola, and including the evidence (and lack of evidence) surrounding policies, would be useful on an ongoing routine basis, rather than in reaction to a current outbreak. It is essential to learn from Ebola rather than moving on without full and careful consideration of how service providers can be better prepared in the future. In addition to the need for accurate scientific knowledge of an infectious threat, 15 it is critical to consider the communicative, environmental, cultural 'platform' for outbreak responsiveness, to allow the best possible care for patients and protection of healthcare professionals.",
