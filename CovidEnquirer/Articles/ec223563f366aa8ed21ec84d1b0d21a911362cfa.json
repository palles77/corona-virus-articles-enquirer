A K359H (KH) RdRp derivative is slow and faithful relative to wild-type enzyme. In the 28 context of the virus, RdRp-coding sequence evolves, selecting for the following substitutions: I331F 29 (IF, motif-C) and P356S (PS, motif-D). We have evaluated IF-KH, PS-KH, and IF-PS-KH viruses and 30 enzymes. The speed and fidelity of each double mutant are equivalent. Each exhibits a unique 31 recombination phenotype, with IF-KH being competent for copy-choice recombination and PS-KH 32 being competent for forced-copy-choice recombination. Although the IF-PS-KH RdRp exhibits 33 biochemical properties within twofold of wild type, the virus is impaired substantially for 34 recombination in cells. We conclude that there are biochemical properties of the RdRp in addition to 35 speed and fidelity that determine the mechanism and efficiency of recombination. The interwoven 36 nature of speed, fidelity, the undefined property suggested here, and recombination makes it impossible 37 to attribute a single property of the RdRp to fitness. However, the derivatives described here may 38 permit elucidation of the importance of recombination on the fitness of the viral population in a 39 background of constant polymerase speed and fidelity.",

One function/mechanism of the RdRp that has been targeted most is that required for faithful 66 incorporation of nucleotides (4-9). Changing RdRp fidelity decreases or increases the genetic variation 67 of the viral population, which, in turn, decreases fitness and virulence of the viral population (10-15). 68 Known RdRp variants exhibiting a high-fidelity phenotype can also exhibit a reduced speed of 69 nucleotide incorporation, at least at the biochemical level (16). Replication speed is also a determinant 70 of viral fitness and virulence (17). So, is it the increased fidelity or decreased speed of nucleotide 71 .

Further complicating the fidelity-versus-speed 72 question are the recent observations that changes to fidelity also have consequence for the efficiency of 73 recombination (18-23). Increased RdRp fidelity decreases recombination efficiency and vice versa 74 (18-23). It will likely be impossible to attribute a single biochemical property of the RdRp to 75 biological outcome. 76 The most extensively studied PV fidelity mutants encode RdRps with amino acid substitutions at 77 sites remote from the active site. Constructing equivalent substitutions conferring equivalent 78 phenotypes in RdRps other than PV is difficult if not impossible. Our laboratory has therefore pursued 79 active-site-based strategies to manipulate the fidelity, speed, and/or recombination efficiency of the 80 RdRp (24). We have shown that a lysine (Lys-359 in PV) present in conserved structural motif D of 81 the RdRp contributes to the efficiency of nucleotidyl transfer (24). A PV mutant encoding a K359R 82",

Almost invariably, the derivatives changed 98 residues remote from the catalytic site, thus using an allosteric mechanism to perturb fidelity. Among 99 the most famous of these is the G64S substitution in PV RdRp (15, 16, 26). Many years ago, our 100 laboratory showed that the active site of all polymerases contain a general acid, Lys-359 in the case of 101 PV RdRp, that protonated the pyrophosphate leaving group during nucleotidyl transfer, thereby 102 increasing the catalytic efficiency of RdRp (24). Substitutions of Lys-359 in PV RdRp give rise to 103 changes in fidelity (6, 17). The arginine substitution of Lys-359 (K359R RdRp) and the histidine 104 substitution (K359H RdRp) catalyze nucleotidyl transfer at a rate 10-fold lower than wild type (24).",

IF-KH and PS-KH PVs also 152 exhibited a higher fidelity than WT PV (Fig. 2C) . Importantly, both mutants exhibited essentially 153 equivalent fidelity phenotypes (Fig. 2C) , consistent with the suggestion above that the reduced 154 efficiency of plaque formation observed for PS-KH PV is likely related to impairment of virus 155 assembly and/or spread. Finally, evaluation of IF-PS-KH PV revealed equivalent sensitivity of this 156 mutant to ribavirin as observed for WT PV (Fig. 2C) , suggesting that fidelity had been returned to Based on the myriad RdRp fidelity mutants that have been reported to date, there appears to be 164 a direct correlation between the rate of nucleotide addition (speed) and the fidelity of nucleotide 165 addition (6, 10, 17, 22, 33). This correlation also extends to recombination efficiency (22) . If this is 166 the case, then the ongoing debate of speed versus fidelity as the key determinant of viral fitness will 167 become even more complicated to resolve (17). 168 The current state of the art for evaluation of recombination in cell culture is based on the co-169 transfection of two viral (sub)genomic RNAs incapable of producing infectious virus (34). The donor 170 RNA is a replication-competent, subgenomic RNA that encodes a luciferase reporter instead of the 171 viral capsid (Fig. 3A) . The acceptor RNA is a replication-incompetent, genomic RNA that has a 172 defective cis-acting replication element, termed oriI ( Fig. 3A) (34). Initiation of replication on the 173 donor followed by a switch to the acceptor at a site after the oriI locus will yield an infectious genome 174 that can be scored by plaque assay (Fig. 3A) (34). 175 We evaluated our panel of KH-containing PV mutants using this assay, and the outcomes were, 176 in most cases, quite unexpected (Fig. 3B) . KH PV was unable to produce viable recombinants, as 177 expected for a high-fidelity RdRp (22). The first surprise was that IF-KH and PS-KH PVs did not 178 exhibit the same phenotypes (Fig. 3B) .

However, in the few instances in 235 which RdRp derivatives exhibiting perturbed fidelity have been characterized, these derivatives also 236 exhibit changes to the rate of nucleotide addition (6, 10, 17, 22, 33). Relative to wild-type polymerase, 237 a higher fidelity polymerase is a slower enzyme, and a lower fidelity polymerase is a faster enzyme (6, 238 10, 17, 22, 33). Polymerase speed will clearly determine replication kinetics and therefore can 239 contribute to viral fitness, as has been suggested recently (17). The most extensively characterized 240 fidelity mutants of PV harbor an RdRp with a substitution located at a remote site that likely causes 241 substantial collateral damage, further confounding the fidelity-versus-speed debate (4, 16). This study 242 was motivated by the need to understand better the relationship between the biochemical properties of 243 the viral RdRp and viral fitness, virulence, and pathogenesis. We have had in hand for a long time a 244 PV mutant whose speed and fidelity were perturbed by changing an RdRp active-site residue, K359H 245 (24). We did not publish this PV mutant until now because of its genetic instability (Fig. 1A) . We 246 realized that this genetic instability might actually represent an opportunity, as the biochemical 247 phenotypes reverted by the second-site suppressors might highlight the biochemical properties driving 248 viral fitness.",

Whether or not speed is a consequence of fidelity, vice versa, or completely separable is not clear (17, 33, 52-54). However, these two parameters are linked to recombination efficiency. Moreover, the studies reported 5 herein point to the existence of a biochemical property other than speed and fidelity, referred to here as undefined, that contributes to recombination efficiency.

PV RdRp is among the most extensively studied enzyme both in cells 634 and in test tubes (4). A vast majority of these studies have emphasized elaboration of mechanisms 635 governing efficient incorporation of nucleotides (speed) with high specificity (fidelity). Whether or not 636 speed is a consequence of fidelity, vice versa, or completely separable is not clear (17, 33, 52-54).637However, these two parameters are linked to recombination efficiency. Moreover, the studies reported 638 herein point to the existence of a biochemical property other than speed and fidelity, referred to here as 639 undefined, that contributes to recombination efficiency. Together, the observations reported herein 640 demonstrate that the current state of the art precludes association of a single biochemical property to 641 viral fitness, virulence, and/or pathogenesis.",
