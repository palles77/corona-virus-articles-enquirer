In 2012, Hens et al. [9] proposed using the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to estimate the generation interval distribution from incomplete line list data based on the method by [8] and allowing for auxiliary information to be used in assigning potential infector-infectee pairs. Te Beest et al [10] used a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach as an alternative to the EM-algorithm, to facilitate taking into account uncertainty related to the dates of symptom onset. In this paper, we use an MCMC approach to estimate, next to the serial interval distribution, the generation interval distribution upon specification of the incubation period distribution. We compare the impact of differences amongst previous estimates of the incubation period distribution for COVID-19 and analyse data on clusters of confirmed cases from Singapore (January 21 to February 26) and Tianjin, China (January 14 to February 27).",

However, when the data does not provide sufficient information on directionality of transmission, this lack of auxiliary information may cause problems for estimation.",

However, sensitivity analyses show that changing the incubation period distribution does not have a big impact on our estimates of the generation interval distribution. Second, we do not account for incomplete or possible changes in reporting over the course of the epidemic. Third, we do not acknowledge changes in contact processes and thus behavioral change, which could shape realised generation interval distributions as well as serial interval distributions (unpublished work). Fourth, we do not account for contraction of the generation interval because of depletion of susceptibles.",

A variable that determines how effective these case-based measures are is the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission. Our estimates of this proportion are high, ranging from 0.48 to 0.77. This implies that the effectiveness of case finding and contact tracing in preventing COVID-19 infections will be considerably smaller compared to the effectiveness in preventing SARS or MERS infections, where presymptomatic transmission did not play an important role (see e.g. [15] ). It is unlikely that these measures alone will suffice to control the COVID-19 epidemic. Additional measures, such as social distancing, are required. ",

For the Singapore data, allowing the serial interval to be negative decreases the estimated mean generation time from 5.20 days, when restricting missing serial intervals to be positive, to 3.86 (95%CI 2.22-5.60) days when allowing them to be negative. For the Tianjin data, the baseline estimate of the mean generation time (3.95 days) is about the same than when allowing serial intervals to be negative in the Singapore data. However, in the Tianjin data there were already some negative serial intervals among the reported links, which may explain this lower estimate. When allowing for negative serial intervals in the Tianjin data, the mean generation timedecreased to 2.90 (1.85-4.12) days. These are the first estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19. Sensitivity analyses show that the assumptions made about the incubation period have only moderate impact on the results. On the other hand, assumptions made about the underlying transmission network (e.g. acknowledging possibly negative serial intervals) have a large impact on our results.",
