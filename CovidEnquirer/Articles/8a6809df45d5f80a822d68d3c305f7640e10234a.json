Early detection of these virus variants may offer the chance for increased containment and potentially prevention of the virus spread. We have developed and field-tested a resequencing kit that is capable of interrogating all eight segments of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus genome and its variants, with added focus on critical regions such as drug-binding sites, structural components and mutation hotspots. The accompanying base-calling software (EvolSTAR) introduces novel methods that utilize neighbourhood hybridization intensity profiles and substitution bias of probes on the microarray for mutation confirmation and recovery of ambiguous base queries. Our results demonstrate that EvolSTAR is highly accurate and has a much improved call rate. The high throughput and short turn-around time from sample to sequence and analysis results (30 h for 24 samples) makes this kit an efficient largescale evolutionary biosurveillance tool.",

            "text": "In order to enable large-scale identification of variations of H1N1(2009) viruses from multiple patient samples, it is necessary to develop a low-cost method for rapidly wholegenome sequencing the H1N1 samples. Historically, sequencing of viral genomes is performed using standard dye termination technologies. These conventional sequencing technologies produce accurate data but are too slow, costly and labour-intensive to be practical for large-scale epidemiologic or evolutionary investigations in viral outbreaks. Oligonucleotide resequencing microarrays that are capable of identifying nucleotide sequence variants may offer an alternative solution (2, 3) and in recent years, have been used for detecting and subtyping influenza viruses (4, 5) . By analysing sequences generated from tiling probes across targeted regions of various strains of the influenza virus [e.g. partial fragments of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes], important information such as viral subtypes, lineages and sequence variants can be determined. Apart from influenza, resequencing microarrays have also been used to obtain whole-genome primary sequences for orthopoxviruses (6) , biothreat viruses (7) and SARS (8) . The reported studies mainly use platform accompanying software that employs probabilistic base-calling algorithms such as ABACUS (3) and Nimblescan PBC (8) . Although statistically sound, these methods are susceptible to hybridization noise caused by factors such as poor probe quality, poor amplification or mutations. This results in numerous ambiguous and false positive base calls that may affect the accuracy of downstream evolutionary analysis. Efforts have been made to improve the call rates and accuracies of existing probabilistic base-calling algorithms. For example, Model-P uses probe and sequence features to build intensity-prediction models that compute maximum likelihood scores for base-calling (9) . Another approach filters low-confidence base calls from problematic regions (e.g. regions with high mutation rates or repeats), thereby reducing the number of false-positive base calls (10) . Depending on the stringencies of the filters used, call rates may suffer as a result.",

We defined the NHIP of each query base as the observed pattern of hybridization intensities of its PM and MM probes and neighbouring (\u00b16 bases from query base) PM and MM probes.

In addition, we also found that long chains of consecutive error and 'N' calls (especially at the 5 0 -and 3 0 -end of the sample sequences) often have NHIPs where the PM probe of the query base together with neighbouring PM probes, have poor hybridization differentiation with their MM probes (Figure 7) . These error and 'N' calls usually occur at the ends of the genome segments. In summary, NHIP analysis showed that all true mutation calls had a characteristic profile (Figure 2b ) that differed from wild-type sequence calls (Figure 2a ). Ambiguous calls arising from different causes, such as homopolymers, isolated errors and hybridization artifacts also have profiles that are distinct from true mutation profiles ( Figure 2 ).

For each true call, we generated a hybridization intensity reduction order by ranking the PM and MM probes of a particular strand in decreasing order of hybridization intensity and recording their respective frequencies (Table 1 ). Table 1 shows that for each PM probe encoding, certain hybridization intensity reduction orders occur much more frequently than others. For example, if the PM probe encoding is 'A' (regardless of strand), then it is most likely that the hybridization intensity reduction order is 'TGC' or 'GTC'. Thus, by matching the hybridization intensity reduction orders of its PM/ MM probes with that in Table 1 , we can compute the likelihood that the putative base call for a query base with ambiguous signals is correct (see 'Materials and Methods' section). In this way, we can recover base calls of ambiguous query bases exceeding a reasonably high likelihood threshold and achieve better accuracy and call rate than PBC.",

If the gain-of-signal is ambiguous, or if the base called is different from the expected sequence, then NHIP and nucleotide substitution bias is deployed to verify the sequence call. From empirical experiments and comparison with capillary sequence data, we observed that high quality sequence calls are made when the signal from the PM probe for both forward and reverse strands are at least 40% higher than that of the MM probes.",

The remaining 30% of the error calls had a NHIP reminiscent of a true-mutation NHIP but did not satisfy the substitution bias rule. Using NHIP and substitution biases analysis together, we were able to reduce the number of false mutation calls to only two. Most of the 4434 'N' calls made by PBC were due to conflicting base calls from the forward and reverse strand. By analysing the NHIP and hybridization intensity reduction order of the query base in the forward and reverse strand individually, we were able to identify the noisy strand and hence, make the base call only from the non-noisy strand. We were able to recover 92% of the 'N' calls made by PBC using this approach.",

Our results showed that EvolSTAR is robust and performs well when samples are prepared under sub-optimal conditions. Even for nasal swab samples that tend to have much less concentration of virus RNA than cell cultures, EvolSTAR suffered only a slight drop in performance compared to Nimblescan PBC. In conclusion, we have shown that EvolSTAR is robust and generates sequence calls of high accuracy and reproducibility in this pilot study consisting of 40 microarray experiments. Meanwhile, efforts will be put in to continually evaluate EvolSTAR with more samples and update it on a regular basis as the H1N1(2009) influenza virus evolves.",

The heat map bar allows the technician to rapidly assess the quality of the sequence data obtained from the microarray and identify regions where PCR did not work well, or presence of potential recombination/ reassortment events. Mutations, especially those in close proximity to drug binding sites, can be quickly visualized.

This approach works well for high-confidence base-calls but is inadequate to extract sufficient information from noisy base-calls. It is also difficult to determine the validity of a mutation call purely based on the distribution of hybridization intensities of its PM and MM probes. In this work, we have described two new hybridization intensity analysis methods that enable us to confidently identify true mutations and recover some noisy base calls. Compared to PBC, EvolSTAR has achieved superior call rates and accuracies, especially in low-concentration samples with high CT values. The robustness of the base calls enables our approach to be a practical large-scale evolutionary surveillance tool.",

            "text": "Although we are confident that our resequencing array can successfully generate complete sequences for the H1N1(2009) virus and its variants at the current stage, we cannot rule out the possibility of reassortments between the H1N1(2009) virus and other influenza viruses. Clearly, our resequencing array cannot fully sequence such events and will generate sequences with poor quality and coverage of the reassorted segments. To investigate the effects of a reassortment event on our array, we independently amplified segments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus and segment 4 of a H3N2 influenza A virus, and hybridized them onto our array. The visualization map of this experiment is shown in Figure 9 . As expected, the sequence call for segment 4 [based on PM/MM probes from the segment 4 consensus of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus] is poor in quality and coverage. However, we observed that we were able to get good base calls from region 1150-1547. This region turns out to be the only significantly similar (70% matched) region between the segment 4 consensus of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus and segment 4 of a H3N2 virus (CY039087). This shows that identifying regions of high similarity between the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus with other influenza viruses and checking if these regions have good sequence calls may be a plausible way of detecting reassortments. The drawback of this approach is that it will fail to detect reassortment of Table 3 . Hybridization intensity reduction orders found in 14 hybridization experiments certain segments where there are no regions of high similarity between the H1N1(2009) virus and the parental influenza virus. It is also difficult to annotate and differentiate every region that the H1N1(2009) virus and all other influenza viruses share similarity with. We propose an alternative approach to detect reassortments. By analysing the PM/MM hybridization intensity foldchange of high confidence calls of all eight segments, we found that the average PM/MM hybridization intensity fold-change of high confidence calls in segments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 belonging to the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus is $4.5 while the average PM/MM hybridization intensity fold-change of high confidence calls in segment 4 belonging to the H3N2 influenza A virus is only 1.9. The most likely reason for this huge drop in the average PM/MM hybridization intensity fold-change of high confidence calls is that the signal gained by most of the segment 4 PM probes on our array are through cross-hybridization to the segment 4 sequence of the H3N2 influenza A virus, and thus much lower than signal gained from true specific binding. Thus, by computing and comparing the average PM/MM hybridization intensity fold-change of high confidence calls in each segment, we can identify potential reassortments in a given H1N1(2009) virus sample. Virus samples with possible reassortments can then be sequenced using . A heat map bar is used to represent the quality and coverage of its sequence calls. The locations of all mutation calls made by EvolSTAR are represented by red triangles beneath the heat map bar. Sequences with coverage <90% are automatically flagged as 'low coverage'. Other details such as coverage: percentage of base calls successfully made, match: number of base calls that match the reference sequence i.e. non-mutation base calls, strong mismatch: number of high confidence base calls that do not match the reference sequence i.e. mutation base calls, weak mismatch: number of low-confidence base-calls that do not match the reference sequence i.e. mutation base calls and Ns: number of 'N' calls, for each sequence call are also shown on the visualization map. capillary sequencing or customized reassortment resequencing arrays.",

From our analysis, it would be possible to resequence all the published isolates using this resequencing approach. However, as antigenic drift is expected to occur, it is likely that the resequencing array would need to be updated at least annually. Updating the array requires only bioinformatics input, and does not require any other additional manufacturing costs. Thus, this combination of sample amplification primers, low-cost multiplex array and robust interpretation software allows sustainable, rapid, large-scale biosurveillance of the influenza H1N1(2009) virus.",

In our application, resequencing microarrays are relatively low-cost, costing only a 10th that of a 454 run, and equivalent to that of a traditional capillary sequencing run. However, through multiplexing, our system can generate full genomes of 24 different H1N1(2009) samples in 30 h. In comparison, capillary sequencing and next-generation technologies such as 454 may obtain full genomes of only one or two different samples in the same time-frame. In practice, capillary sequencing is labour-intensive and thus impractical for large-scale full genome sequencing of viruses in an outbreak. In our experience with the 454 system, much of the amplified material is still human (as the bulk of the patient sample material is human RNA with very little influenza RNA), requiring very deep sequencing to obtain a complete flu genome sequence, with one compartment of a run not yielding sufficient viral information. Furthermore, assembly of the sequence fragments is required before any analysis can be done. Any abnormalities or gaps in the assembly would then require additional runs of 454, incurring more cost and time. Hence, our approach based on resequencing microarrays presents a cost-effective and efficient solution for high-throughput full genome sequencing of viruses.",
