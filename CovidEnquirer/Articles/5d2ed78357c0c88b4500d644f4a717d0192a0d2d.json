            "text": "In the present studies , we report the cloning and structural characterization of the HFGL2 gene and its functional role in human fulminant hepatitis. The HFGL2 gene is approximately 7 kb in length with 2 exons. The putative promoter contains cis element consensus sequences that strongly suggest the inducibility of its expression. From the nucleotide sequence of the human gene , a 439-amino acid long protein is predicted. The overall identity between the murine fgl2 and hfgl2 coded proteins is over 70%. About 225 amino acids at the carboxyl end of these molecules are almost 90% identical , and correspond to a well-conserved fibrinogen-related domain. Both HFGL2 and FGL2 encode a type II transmembrane protein with a predicted catalytic domain toward the amino terminus of the protein. Transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with a fulllength cDNA of HFGL2 coding region resulted in high levels of prothrombinase activity. Livers from 8 patients transplanted for fulminant viral hepatitis were examined for extent of necrosis , inflammation, fibrin deposition , and HFGL2 induction. In situ hybridization showed positive staining of macrophages in areas of active hepatocellular necrosis. Fibrin stained positively in these areas and was confirmed by electron microscopy. These studies define a unique prothrombinase gene (HFGL2) and implicate its importance in the pathogenesis of fulminant viral hepatitis.",

The hallmark of the condition is the extreme rapidity of the necroinflammatory process resulting in widespread or total hepatocellular necrosis in weeks or even days; any satisfactory explanation must explain this rapid progression.",

            "text": "A novel murine cDNA fgl2, encoding a protein with prothrombinase-like activity, was previously cloned in our laboratory. 2 The sequence of the cDNA was essentially identical to a previously described sequence corresponding to a gene encoding a mouse fibrinogen-like protein, originally described as a cytotoxic T-cell-specific gene. When the cDNA containing the entire coding region was expressed in RAW 264.7 cells, a prothrombinase activity was detected by both a one-stage clotting assay and cleavage of 125 I-labeled prothrombin. Using a model of fulminant viral hepatitis, we demonstrated a causal relationship between the induction of fgl2 prothrombinase and the mortality of murine hepatitis virus infection (MHV-3). 3 We demonstrated that after MHV-3 infection in susceptible mice, mRNA transcripts of fgl2 were seen in macrophages and endothelial cells in the liver followed by fibrin deposition and liver necrosis. 4 The infusion of high-titered monoclonal antibodies to fgl2 prevented the coagulation disturbance, the hepatic necrosis, and mortality associated with MHV-3 infection. 5 Here we report the isolation and characterization of the HFGL2 gene, which encodes for a potent prothrombinase and demonstrate mRNA transcripts of this gene in the earliest hepatic lesions of fulminant viral hepatitis. This study defines distinctive aspects of the cellular and molecular pathology of fulminant viral hepatitis and implicates viral-induced up-regulation of the potent human fgl2 prothrombinase gene in this lethal disease. Therapies directed toward this prothrombinase offer the potential for attenuation of disease in man, similar to exciting recent findings in a murine model of fulminant viral hepatitis.",

The HFGL2 gene was localized to the short arm of chromosome 7 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid mapping (data not shown). The HFGL2 gene is approximately 7 kb in length. This size was determined by the known mRNA sequence that contains exon I and II (4.4 kb) plus an intron sequence of 2.2 kb. Exon II encodes for the last 235 amino acids of the HFGL2 protein and contains the 3\u0408 UTR. The putative promoter region contains cis element consensus sequences such as a TATA box, an AP1 site, a C/EBP binding site (CAAT), and multiple Ets sites which suggest the inducibility of HFGL2. Of interest, the C/EBP binding sites have been shown to play a pivotal role in the induction of acute phase response genes of the liver and cytokine genes of macrophages. 12, 13 Two messages of size 4.4 kb and 1.5 kb were detected in the Northern blot studies. The polyadenylation (polyA) site identified at position 1476 most likely gives rise to transcription termination that leads to the shorter 1.5-kb message. A 282-nucleotide long Alu element, starting at position 1655, has technically challenged our cloning of the distal end of the 3\u0408 UTR of HFGL2. A possible polyA signal further downstream in the yet to be cloned region of the HFGL2, probably gives rise to the 4.4-kb mRNA. Our Northern blot studies show that the presence of the two mRNA species is tissue dependent (Figure 2, A and  B) . For example, in tissues such as the colon, small intestine, stomach, and prostate the 4.4-kb mRNA predominates. However, in tissues such as the ovary, the 1.5-kb mRNA transcript is expressed predominantly, whereas in the spleen, uterus, skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood leukocytes, the two mRNA transcripts are present in near equal amounts (Figure 2, A and B) . The data provided in this report do not reflect quantitative comparisons between tissues but do demonstrate qualitatively, relative expression of the different sized mRNAs within each tissue (organ).",

A cDNA of HFGL2, encompassing the entire coding region, was cloned into pcDNA3.1-His and expressed as a fusion protein (phfgl2his) in CHO cells ( Figure 3B ). Three hfgl2 specific proteins were detected (200, 140, and 62 kd) by immunoblotting, suggesting that the encoded protein is a dimer or trimer composed of 65-kd subunits joined by disulfide bonds. These results are consistent with a previous report. 14 Transient transfection of CHO cells with a full-length cDNA of the HFGL2 coding region resulted in the expression of a procoagulant activity which accelerated the clotting time of recalcified plasma ( Table 1 ). The high level of procoagulant activity coincided with the expression of a pro- thrombinase which directly cleaved prothrombin to thrombin ( Figure 4 ). This data strongly supports the hypothesis that like its murine counterpart, the HFGL2 gene encodes a prothrombinase activity.",

The livers were removed at transplantation for fulminant hepatic failure and showed widespread (range, 60% to 90%) hepatocellular necrosis (Table 3 ). In six instances, there were surviving areas of parenchyma comprising less than 40% of the liver. These areas typically showed earlier stages of active hepatitis with focal, confluent, or bridging necrosis ( Figure 5 ). In two instances, the entire liver showed end-stage liver disease with total panlobular necrosis. All were examined by in situ hybridization for the presence of HFGL2 prothrombinase mRNA transcripts and by immunohistochemical methods for CD68-positive macrophages or histiocytes as well as fibrin. In the four cases in which surviving parenchyma was seen, fgl2 prothrombinase RNA was detected in macrophages in association with fibrin deposits in vascular sinusoids located selectively in the areas of acute focal, confluent, or bridging necrosis but was infrequent or absent in the more advanced areas of panlobular necrosis in which only the consequences of the active hepatocellular necrotizing process remained. Fibrin deposits were observed by immunoperoxidase staining with an antibody specific for fibrinogen and fibrin, and fibrin thrombi in sinusoids were confirmed by electron microscopy. Panels A to E in Figure 5 are all from areas of residual parenchyma to show regions of bridging necrosis and for comparison, a large area of complete hepatic necrosis and collapse.

Progression ensued by further fibrin deposition and arrest of sinusoidal blood flow leading to the rapid development of confluent multicellular hepatic necrosis resulting in fulminant hepatic failure and death in 4 days. 4 There is strong evidence for implicating fgl2 prothrombinase as pivotal in the pathogenesis of this disease in the mouse model: levels of this prothrombinase activity correlate with the severity of the disease; 16, 17 and there is concordance between expression of fgl2 prothrombinase in the liver with fibrin deposition; and neutralizing antibodies attenuate the pathological and clinical manifestations. 5 Indeed, it is not the viral load that determines the occurrence of massive necrosis but the viral induced up-regulation of the fgl2 gene which initiates the pathological process. 5, 18 Although, treatment with neutralizing antibodies to the fgl2 gene abrogates the disease, a high viral load persists. 5 Fulminant murine hepatitis and fgl2 gene expression were shown to be genetically linked and it is likely that host genetic factors are also important in human fulminant hepatitis. 19 The similarities in the putative promoter elements in human and mouse fgl2 indicate they are both regulated in a similar manner. Recently we have shown that the nucleocapsid protein of strains of MHV which cause fulminant hepatic failure is responsible for transcription of the fgl2 gene. 20 By mapping of the fgl2 promoter, we have defined an enhanceosome consisting of three transcription elements LF-A1, GMCSF, and IE1.2. Interestingly, LF-A1 is a liver specific promoter element that regulates transcription of known coagulation factors. [21] [22] [23] The fact that the severity of both hepatitis B and hepatitis C are related to expression of the nucleocapsid protein (core protein) suggests that these studies of MHV may parallel the pathogenesis of human viral hepatitis. 20 Other investigators have implicated thrombin as a pivotal mediator in liver injury, and in particular in acute viral fulminant hepatitis. 24 -27 The local production of thrombin may explain the fibrin deposition during acute liver injury. In favor of this, is the recent report demonstrating increased expression of the thrombin receptor in patients with fulminant hepatitis. 28 Other inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and reactive oxygen intermediates have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of organ failure. 29, 30 Treatment of rats with recombinant neutralizing antibody to TNF-\u2423 has been shown to protect against hypotension, hypothermia, and mortality of Gram-negative sepsis. 31, 32 Furthermore, the mortality associated with endotoxin shock was reduced with an IL-1 receptor antagonist. 33 We have previously reported that IL-1 and TNF-\u2423 induce endothelial cell transcription of fgl2 linking cytokines and induction of coagulation. 18 However, antibodies to TNF or IL-1 were unable to prevent the hepatic necrosis caused by MHV-3. 3 The role of the immune coagulation system in fulminant hepatic failure is controversial. 33 Mori et al 34 have reported that fibrin is a classical feature but this has not been substantiated by others. The reason for not finding fibrin may be attrib-uted to its transient nature as reported here, and also the lack of precision of the histological methodologies used to detect fibrin in tissues. It is also pertinent to mention here that other investigators have cloned and sequenced HFGL2 and termed it musfblp in the mouse 35 and fibroleukin in humans. 36 Both groups isolated the molecule from T lymphocytes and postulated its role as an extracellular matrix protein important in regulatory T-cell activation. It is also important to note that other molecules with homology to fgl2 such as cytotaxin 37 or tenascin, 38 have potent immunoregulatory effects on T cells. Thus, expression of HFGL2 may explain accumulation of inflammatory cells in areas of liver injury and immunological disturbances that may contribute to the hepatic necrosis. Preliminary results from our laboratory have shown that recombinant fgl2 is a potent inhibitor of mixed lymphocyte reaction and cytotoxic T cell responses (work in progress). These findings may explain the immunosuppressant status and inability to clear the virus in patients and mice with fulminant hepatic failure.",

            "text": "The amino acid sequence suggests that both HFGL2 and fgl2 are either secreted or type II transmembrane proteins. Ruegg and Pytela 6 have suggested that HFGL2 is a secreted protein. However, further analysis of the sequence suggests that the protein is a type II transmembrane protein. This is based on the fact that the region from position 3 to 23 is hydrophobic. This 21-amino acid log stretch is sufficiently long enough to span the layered phospholipid cell membrane. Furthermore, the amino terminus has a tendency to maintain a helical configuration characteristic of transmembrane domains. 39 Previously, we reported that fgl2 was a serine protease based on inhibition studies with diisopropyl fluorophosphate and other serine protease inhibitors. 40 Unlike the serine proteases of the coagulation cascade with the catalytic domain GDSGG, belonging to clan SA, HFGL2 could belong to clan SE serine protease with the active site motif S..K. The motifs at positions 91 and 142 could potentially serve as the catalytic sites. Preliminary data using site-directed mutagenesis suggest that the motif at position 91 is the active catalytic domain (unpublished data). After the cystein at position 213, the rest of the carboxyl end of the HFGL2 protein consists of a domain homologous to the FREDs (fibrinogen related domain) which is found on a number of different proteins with functional diversity. Examples of these proteins are the three chains of fibrinogen, tenacin, ficolin, and HFREP-1. [41] [42] [43] The molecular and cellular results reported here in human fulminant hepatitis mimic closely the changes observed in the murine model in which the pathogenesis of the disease has been studied in a stepwise fashion. 3, 4 A common molecular mechanism is suggested. The viral induced up-regulation of the fgl2 gene and the potent prothrombinase molecule it encodes plays a pivotal role in initiating the immunothrombotic microcirculatory changes that lead to the rapidly spreading necrosis. Thus, there is a causal link between fgl2 gene up-regulation that initiates immune coagulation and the transient but devastating microthrombosis in sinusoids resulting in rapid, progressive, and widespread hepatocellular necrosis both in humans and in mice. Having established this relationship, the provocative and exciting findings of successful abrogation of the lethal effects of the fgl2 gene in murine fulminant viral hepatitis offers the potential for developing methods for attenuating the disease in man.",

The inserts are oriented with respect to the sp6 and T7 ends of the PAC vector. The rectangular boxes represent the two exons of HFGL2; the one on the left is exon I and the one on the right is exon II. The restriction enzymes are abbreviated such that; p: PvuII; s: SmaI, h: HindIII; e: EcoRI; pst: PstI; sal: SalI. In b, the short vertical lines near the sp6 indicate that the distance is not drawn to scale. In a and c the slanted lines represent the regions where the exact distance between the SmaI sites are not determined. B: two exons are represented with 2 filled rectangular boxes. The numbers in B related to the translation start site of HFGL2.",
