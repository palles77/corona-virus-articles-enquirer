Although some continuing educational societies aim to improve the level of general knowledge, published scientific facts are still rare, and there are many hypotheses or affirmations that remain unverified or even sometimes dogmatic or empirical. Taking some examples, this article reviews the main causes that may sometimes create difficulties for a veterinary practitioner faced with a dog or a cat suffering from reproductive problems. It could be difficult to orientate the diagnosis or the therapeutic approach, not knowing if what is found in the literature is a scientific certainty or just an unverified affirmation. This problem may result from the fact that there are still physiological processes that remain unclear, but also that some common beliefs are based on old studies that have not been repeated or verified, unverified affirmations, unclear nomenclature, clinical conditions which have not been standardized in the literature, clinical conditions mostly described through case reports, lack of studies on specific topics, areas of small animal reproduction that have been neglected by researchers, contradictory data or even studies that lack objectivity. The growing interest for research in Small Animal Reproduction will probably reduce the gap between unverified beliefs and scientific facts.",

            "text": "Small Animal Reproduction (SAR) is a topic that has developed recently. Until the eighties, within most veterinary faculties the teaching content in the field of Animal Reproduction was mainly -and sometimes only -based on reproduction in horses and farm animals, that were considered having an economic value. But progressively, following the growing interest in companion animals in modern societies, the scientific and academic interest for SAR expanded. Some precursors such as Professor Patrick W. Concannon in the USA who began publishing some scientific data about canine endocrinology in 1975 (1), found the basic knowledge essential for further research. The first International Symposium on Canine and Feline Reproduction (ISCFR) was organized in Dublin (Ireland) in 1988, bringing together for the first time around 100 specialized academics or practitioners. It was the beginning of an exponential interest for dog and cat reproduction, including both domestic and wild canids and felids, with an international symposium occurring every 4 years since then. In Europe, a species-oriented continuing education society -the European Veterinary Society for Small Animal Reproduction (EVSSAR) -was created in the nineties and held its first annual meeting in 1998 in Barcelona (Spain), and every year since then. In 2001, the first academic book entirely devoted into SAR was written by Shirley Johnston, Margaret Root-Kustritz and Patricia Olson (2) . It extensively reviewed all the published data until that date and is still nowadays considered as a reference book for most students and academics. However, it probably represented a tremendous amount of work to prepare and since 2001, although some dedicated manuals on SAR have been published in different countries, no similar extensive review on published scientific data has been made and the book of Johnston et al. (2) has not been updated. It means that some of the data found in this book may have been changed or modified in some articles published later, but may not be accessible to veterinary students or Journal Pre-proof 3 general practitioners. This probably contributes to the difficulty of differentiating scientific facts and unverified beliefs in the field of SAR.",

The survey was performed in 86 institutions of veterinary education belonging to 32 European countries, 15 within the European Union (EU) and 17 outside the EU, in Central and Eastern Europe and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and was aimed to provide a view of the general status of education and research in SAR in Europe (3) . It showed that, although more than 60% institutions were providing a well-balanced comparative teaching in animal reproduction, in some places the teaching was more species orientated. The author concluded that, in the absence of comparative data and research used in education and in the development of new technologies in SAR, there was a risk that sound science-based academic education might be constrained. To counteract these negative trends, SAR should be recognized as a very important branch of the department of animal reproduction. This should lead to the development of a high quality research rejecting empiricism and dogmas.",

            "text": "Furthermore, it appears important to develop clinical approaches based on evidence based medicine (EBM). 4 ovulation in the queen. In most books and academic reviews, including the reference book from Johnston et al. (2) , the cat is presented as an induced ovulator, and luteinizing hormone (LH) release from the pituitary gland, and subsequent ovulation, is said to be induced by copulation in the queen. However, since the early nineties some authors have reported cases of spontaneous ovulation in groups of queens housed together (4, 5) . In wild felids, some species such as lions, clouded leopards, leopards, Pallas' cats, fishing cats or margays may show alternatively induced or spontaneous ovulations (6) . On the other hand, it is well known that some non-mated queens may develop a pyometra during their life, and that this diseaseapart from treatment with progestins -is often linked with progesterone impregnation that follows ovulation (7) . Although a study conducted on demand of an insurance company in Sweden (8) showed that the overall incidence rate (IR) of this disease appeared low (17 cats per 10,000), a significant breed effect was observed. The breed with the highest IR (433 cats per 10,000) was the Sphynx, and other breeds with IR over 60 cats per 10,000 were Siberian cat, Ocicat, Korat, Siamese, Ragdoll, Maine coon, and Bengal. Pyometra was more commonly diagnosed with increasing age, with a marked increase in cats older than 7 years (8) . An objection to the claim that the queen is a strictly induced ovulator is that a so called \"spontaneous ovulation\", which appears without any coitus, seems especially frequent in breeding catteries. In Domestic Shorthair queens living in groups of females, the level of spontaneous ovulations may reach up to 87% (5). In a preliminary study conducted in an experimental cattery in our University (9), we aimed to determine the occurrence and frequency of spontaneous ovulations in a group of 11 queens composed of Domestic Shorthair cats (2/11), Thai cats (6/11), and cross-bred cats (3/11) . No male cats were housed in the same building. During the study 24 oestruses were detected in a 7 months period and in 6/24 cases (four queens only), a significant increase of progesterone after oestrus was detected (26.26 \u00b1 9 .99 ng/mL). Among the four queens that presented this phenomenon, three were Thai cats Journal Pre-proof 5 and one was a cross-bred queen between a Thai and a Domestic Shorthair. Of course, this is not a scientific demonstration but it raises the question of whether the cat should be considered as an alternatively induced or spontaneous ovulatory species, depending on the breed, on the age, and on the housing.",

In a study, Greyhound bitches were mostly in heat in winter, with a highest incidence in February, while the lowest frequency of their cycles was in November (14) .

In this respect, the meta-analysis studies made by the group of Beauvais et al. on the effect of neutering on the risk of developing mammary tumours in dogs (17) and also on the risk of developing urinary incontinence in bitches (18) are perfect examples. Concerning the belief Journal Pre-proof 7 that an early neutering lowers significantly the risk for a bitch to develop mammary tumours later in her life, it is based on a study published in 1969 which has not been repeated since then (19) . This may raise some skepticism when we suppose that the way of evaluating the quality of scientific articles may have changed considerably since the sixties. Indeed in the first study by Beauvais et al. (17) , among 13 selected reports in English-language peerreviewed journals addressing the association between neutering, age at neutering and mammary tumours, nine were judged to have a high risk of bias. The remaining four were classified as having a moderate risk of bias. One study found an association between neutering and a reduced risk of mammary tumours. Two studies found no evidence of association. One reported \"some protective effect\" of neutering on the risk of mammary tumours, but no numbers were presented. Due to the limited evidence available and the risk of bias in the published results, the authors concluded that evidence that neutering reduces the risk of mammary neoplasia, and the evidence that age at neutering has an effect, are judged to be weak and are not a sound basis for firm recommendations. Even if this belief appears to be probably true for most veterinary practitioners following bitches all life long (very few bitches spayed at an early age develop mammary tumours), it is wrong to present this as a scientific fact.",

The authors concluded that the preputial cytology has a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of oestrogen producing testicular tumours in dogs. It means that for many years -preputial smears being an old and common technique -veterinarians were using \"empirically\" this cytological examination without a real scientific confirmation. To the contrary of preputial smears whose interest has been finally confirmed, there is probably still a huge number of beliefs and practices in the field of SAR that haven't yet had the chance to be confirmed -or infirmed -by scientific works, and are supposed to be useful, although this may not be the case.",

In other terms, different specialists may use similar terms to designate different problems or diseases. A good example is to be found when speaking about uterine diseases in bitches or queens. A more complete classification of the uterine diseases would be very helpful to be sure that everybody is speaking about the same thing. For example, there is often a confusion when using the term \"metritis\". Some authors make a difference between metritis (usually occurring after an oestrus accompanied by mating) and pyometra (occurring during dioestrus) (27) . In 2006, Fieni (28) Another unclear statement concerns mammary fibroadenomatosis in the queen, a disease characterized by enlarged mammary glands, often under the influence of luteal progesterone or the use of exogenous progestins (2) . Histologically, two types of conditions have been identified: a lobular hyperplasia -also called intraductal papillar hyperplasia -which appears to be a result of proliferation of the mammary gland duct epithelium, and a fibroepithelial hyperplasia -also called diffuse fibroepithelial hyperplasia which is a general enlargement of the mammary glands (37) . However, in practice two clinical conditions may be found: one is a diffuse mammary hypertrophy mostly diagnosed in young queens with solid -fibrouscontent, that is commonly treated with success using the progesterone receptor blocker aglepristone (38) , another form is a cystic aspect of the mammary glands, which appear full of Journal Pre-proof liquid with often a blue aspect of the skin. This second form develops often in older queens and doesn't respond very well to the use of aglepristone. We don't really know if it is the same disease and if its pathogenicity is exactly the same. In order to avoid any confusion, the term of \"mastosis\" (by analogy with a human disease, in which the role of estrogens predominates) has been suggested by some others to describe the cystic clinical condition (39) . But specific veterinary research is still lacking to better characterize this disease in the cat.",

This is the case, for example, concerning ovarian diseases. In a recent analysis of the literature, Arlt and Haimerl (42) pointed out that only very little research has been performed on ovarian diseases in the bitch in the last decades, and that our knowledge is mostly based on (42, 43) . This might be due to the fact that various amounts of hormones are secreted, either causing overt clinical signs and/or oestrous irregularities. Most published case reports documented large cysts. This suggests that factors such as size, hormonal activities or other rare patterns may cause a publication bias meaning that weird cases are more likely to be published than ordinary ones (43) .

Indeed these studies tend to show an increased risk of prostatic carcinomas, osteosarcomas, transitional cell carcinomas (72) , lymphomas, haemangiosarcomas (73) or mastocytomas (74) in spayed animals, often with a sex-predisposition.

For the past 10 to 15 years, it has developed following several publications and because it is Journal Pre-proof encouraged by animal welfare societies to limit the number of feral dogs and cats and uncontrolled abandoning of animals, but also by dog and especially cat breeders to protect their genetics and avoid others to breed animals bearing their genetics. Sometimes it may appear that publications promoting this approach lack some objectivity. If such a practice seems indeed interesting to limit uncontrolled reproduction of non-Pedigree pets and feral animals, it shouldn't be forgotten that it may also promote potential health problems such asamong others -urinary incontinence (18) , diseases of the lower urinary tract, the development of a recessed or infantile vulva (76) or the risk of epiphyseal fractures due to the delay of closure of growth cartilages in long bones (77) .

Two years later, Verstegen et al. in 2008 (29) only used the term \"pyometra\". A similar confusion may exist when using the term \"endometritis\", as it may designate different pathological conditions, which may be acute or chronic, and may be associated or not with CEH (35). For some authors (30), it defines a sub-clinical inflammation of the endometrium that does not extend beyond the stratum spongiosum, corresponding histologically to a localized breakthrough into the endometrial epithelium, infiltration of inflammatory cells, vascular congestion, stromal oedema and accumulation of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the upper layers of the endometrium. This \"endometritis\" corresponds more or less to the second stage described by Dow in 1959 (31) from pathological and acute inflammation and even zones of haemorrhage), stage 4 (CEH with chronic endometritis, lympho-plasmocytic infiltration of the endometrium and modifications of the myometrium). This heterogeneity of the nomenclature complicates our understanding of the role of sub-clinical endometritis as creating infertility in the bitch. For example, in a recent study (32) using in vitro explants of endometrium taken from bitches suffering from CEH, the authors postulated that these bitches were accurate models of a mating-induced endometritis because the bitches with endometrial hyperplasia had a mild histological inflammatory reaction similar to that noted by De Bosschere et al. in 2001 (33). However, in 2013 in the study of Mir et al. (34) who analyzed the histological features of surgical biopsies taken on infertile bitches or bitches who suffered from pregnancy arrest, there were several cases of lympho-plasmocytic endometritis or neutrophilic endometritis that were not associated with endometrial hyperplasia.",

If we want to have data on the reversibility after implanting male cats with the most common 4.7 mg SC implant, there is only one published study based on only 10 male cats housed in experimental conditions (54), although there are some published studies based on the 9.4 mg SC implant. Veterinarians should not consider this study as giving a definitive scientific conclusion. Recent unpublished work in our group tend to show that there are considerable variations depending on the breed and on the environment (55). Therefore, in the faith of any recent study, it is recommended to remain prudent in drawing any conclusion until there is enough data collected. 8.

Following the example of the group of Beauvais et al. (17,18) it would be very valuable to make critical reviews of founding articles that have been published a long time ago. Due to the growing interest in SAR, a high quality of published data should be mandatory, which also implies finding accurate and meticulous reviewers. The growing interest for getting knowledge and learning techniques in the field of SAR will probably reduce the gap between unverified beliefs and scientific facts.
