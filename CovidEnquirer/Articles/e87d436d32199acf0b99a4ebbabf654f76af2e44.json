No other carnivore shows such diversity of adaptation, being found in a wide variety of ecosystems ranging from Earlier references to ferrets are probably the basis of the belief that ferrets originated in North Africa (Thomson, 1951) . Evidently they were bred specifically for rabbiting (rabbit hunting) and were muzzled before being sent into rabbit burrows. This practice was later introduced into Europe, Asia, and the British Isles, where the sport is still practiced today.",

Literature reviews undertaken in 1967, 1969, 1973, and 1985 , however, revealed an increasing appreciation for the ferret's usefulness and versatility in the study of human physiologic, anatomic, and disease mechanisms (Hahn and Wester, 1969; Marshall and Marshall, 1973; Shump et al., 1974; Frederick and Babish, 1985) . In 1991, a bibliography containing \"selected\" literature citations on the ferret and its use in biomedical research was published (Clingerman et al., 1991) . The document was designed to serve as a reference tool for individuals involved in the care or use of ferrets in the laboratory setting. Although not comprehensive, the document provides extensive coverage of ferret biology, diseases, and use as an animal model. The domesticated ferret has been and continues to be used extensively in studies involving virology, reproductive physiology, anatomy, and endocrinology, as well as other areas of biomedical research (Morgan and Travers, 1998) . The ferret is also being used to replace the cat in some types of neuroendocrinology, neuroanatomy, and cardiology experiments.",

For example, commercial farms have been raising ferrets for almost 50 years. Biomedical researchers in the United States can request animals of a specific sex, weight, and age for individual experiments. Investigators in other countries may acquire fer-rets from fur operations or may make arrangements with commercial vendors in the United States. Even though the ferret is nonstandardized with regard to exact genotype and pedigree, its routine availability in a clinically healthy state has aided immeasurably its acceptance as a research animal. Readily available commercial stocks, based on coat color, are albino, sable (or fitch), Siamese, silver mitt, and Siamese-silver mitt (Siamese with white chest and feet) (McLain et al., 1985) . The fitch or so-called wild coat color is the most common, recognized by yellow-buff fur with patches of black or dark brown, particularly on the tail and limbs (Andrews and Illman, 1987) . The production of ferrets by large commercial operations has raised concern by some that inbreeding of these animals has made the ferret more susceptible to diseases, e.g., endocrinerelated disorders.",

The tracheal size and laryngeal anatomy make endotracheal intubation somewhat challenging, and as a result the ferret has been advocated as a species suitable for use in pediatric intubation training (Powell et al., 1991) . The lungs are relatively large, and the total lung capacity is nearly 3 times that which would be predicted based on body size, as compared with other mammals. This characteristic, together with a higher degree of bronchiolar branching and more extensive bronchial submucosal glands (as compared with the dog), makes the ferret an attractive model for pulmonary research studies (Vinegar et al., 1985) . Although a previous report (Willis and Barrow, 1971) commented that the carotid arterial branching pattern in the ferret is unusual, it is actually typical for a carnivore. As is the case in the dog and the cat, the paired common carotid arteries arise from the brachiocephalic trunk (sometimes called the innominate artery) at the level of the thoracic inlet (Andrews et al., 1979b) .",

            "text": "absence of careful analysis, however, it is uncertain whether the proportion and quantity of ingredients in these diets is optimal. Ferrets are strict carnivores with a high requirement for dietary fat and protein. Their short digestive tract and rapid gastrointestinal transit time (3-4 hr) require protein to be readily digestible. There is general agreement that ferrets should not be given diets high in complex carbohydrates or fiber. Diets that are high in fish products are also not recommended for ferrets (Fox and McLain, 1998) . The use of any raw chicken, beef, or other meats is strongly discouraged because of the potential contamination by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Listeria, Mycobacterium, and Streptococcus (Fox, 1998a) . Daily maintenance energy consumption for ferrets is 200-300 kcal/kg body weight. Calorie-percent protein ratios have been determined for mink (Mustela vison) kits up to and after 16 weeks of age (Sinclair et al., 1962; Allen et al., 1964) . A ratio of 13 and a caloric density of 550 kcal/100 gm of feed, corresponding to 42% protein, provided optimum growth for male kits up to 16 weeks. After 16 weeks, ratios of 17 and 21, corresponding to 36% and 26% protein, respectively, were recommended. Diets containing 9-28% fat and 22-42% carbohydrate have been used successfully to maintain ferrets. One author recommends 30-40% protein and 18-20% fat for adult, nonbreeding animals and a minimum of 35% protein and 25% fat for reproductively active animals and those that have notreached sexualmaturity (Brown, 1997a) . The long-term impact of diets containing high levels of fat and protein are unknown. Ferrets have been used to investigate the absorption, metabolism, and interaction of the dietary micronutrients [3-carotene and vitamin E. Ferrets, like humans, convert [3-carotene to vitamin A in the gut and absorb ~-carotene intact (Fox and McLain, 1998) . In intestinal perfusion experiments in ferrets, it was demonstrated that [3-carotene, retinol, and retinyl esters are absorbed intact into lymph and that cleavage products, including [3-apo-12'-carotenal, [3-apo-10'-carotenal, and retinoids, accumulate in the intestinal mucosa (Wang et al., 1992) . The intestinal mucosa is capable of converting [3-carotene into retinoic acid and other polar metabolites, which are then transported via the portal vein to the liver (Wang et al., 1993) . [3-Carotene absorption is enhanced by co-perfusion with a-tocopherol, and the perfusion of the latter is unaltered by the presence of [3-carotene. The conversion of [3-carotene into retinol is also enhanced by the presence of a-tocopherol (Wang et al., 1995) . These and other findings have established the ferret as an important model for the study of these antioxidants.",

            "text": "Features of ferret reproduction may be found in Table VI for males, corresponding temporally to increasing day length. Ferrets born in the late spring or early summer and maintained under natural lighting will not assume an adult pattern of gonadal activity (i.e., puberty) until the following season (Baum, 1998) . Under artificial illumination, jills that are maintained at 8 hr light-16 hr dark reach puberty at 10-12 months. Stimulatory photoperiods may be used, however, in the laboratory or intensive production setting, as a method of breeding ferrets out of the natural season. However, the transfer from short to long photoperiods should not occur prior to 90 days of age, because jills that are prematurely transferred will remain anestrous (Hammond and Chesterman, 1972) . Management practices in one breeding facility are such that jills commence breeding at 7-10 months, average 3.7 litters a year, and are cycled out of reproduction after 6 litters. In another strategy, ferrets are exposed to a 16:8 hr photoperiod at 12 weeks of age, are bred at 16 weeks during their first estrus, and whelp at 5V2 months. Vulvar swelling is the hallmark of estrus in jills. The ease with which estrus is detected in the ferret, as well as the size of the ferret and ease of its maintenance in captivity have made the ferret a model for study of neuroendocrine events and their gonadal correlates. Along with the hamster, the ferret has contributed extensively to an understanding of the photoperiodic influences on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (Baum, 1998) . As in females of other species, estradiol concentrations are responsible for controlling the development of the female reproductive tract and secondary sexual characteristics, and the tonic inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by the anterior pituitary during both prepubertal life and anestrus. The sensitivity of the hypothalamic gonadostat to negative feedback inhibition by estradiol changes at the time of puberty, and under the influence of increasing light exposure, LH levels rise despite estradiol (Ryan, 1984) . Similarly, age differences in the sensitivity of negative feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by testosterone, or to estrogenic compounds derived from the aromatization of testosterone, appear to be essential in determining puberty and seasonality of reproduction in the male (Baum, 1998) .",

            "text": "Estrus in jills is characterized by dramatic vulvar swelling from an anestrous diameter of 5-16 mm to an estrous diameter of 17-33 mm. Changes in vaginal cytology have also been described for the ferret and other mustelid species, but these changes are seldom used to determine onset of estrus or to schedule breeding (Williams et al., 1992) . After a 2-to 3-week proestrus, estrus occurs. Estrus onset is not associated with elevated serum FSH in the ferret, as it is in the rodent. Once estrus has occurred, it may terminate in coitus-induced ovulation and pregnancy, pseudopregnancy after infertile mating, pharmacologic termination (by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or GnRH), death due to estrogen-induced aplastic anemia, or spontaneous remission and anestrus due to reduced photoperiod. Waves of follicular development occur in estrus, and 5-13 ova are ovulated approximately 30-40 hr after coitus. Female ferrets are brought to the male approximately 14 days after vulvar enlargement. Females and males copulate many times and for prolonged periods of time; they are typically left together for 2 days. Both intromission and neck restraint by the male are apparently required for induction of ovulation (Baum, 1998 ). An LH surge accompanies coitus in females, but the same is not true of males (Carroll et al., 1987) . Implantation occurs 12 days after mating; both a functional corpus luteum and the anterior pituitary are required for implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. Placentation is typical of carnivores and is zonary and endotheliochorial (Morrow, 1980) . Pregnancy may be detected by ultrasonographic demonstration of 3-5 discrete nonechogenic structures as early as day 12 (Peter et al., 1990) , by palpation as early as day 14, or by radiographic demonstra-tion of calcified fetal skeletons at approximately 30 days of gestation.",

Small litters (fewer than three) may result in inadequate stimulus for parturition. Jills that pass their due date without delivery should be palpated for fetuses. Kits remaining in utero beyond the 43rd day typically die; kits with congenital malformations such as cyclopia and exencephaly may also delay the initiation of labor. Dystocia is common in ferrets because of positional abnormalities and fetal oversize and should be treated by cesarean section. Jills tolerate cesareans well and will nurse kits delivered in this way. If small littel: size is responsible for delayed parturition, prostaglandins (0.5-1.0 mg Lutalyse) may be used, followed by 0.3 ml oxytocin (6 U) after 3 hr (Fox and Bell, 1998) . Failure to deliver within 8 hr of administration of prostaglandin is an indication for cesarean section. Jills should be provided heat, energy, hydration, and analgesia following cesarean.",

The plates are incubated at 37~ or 42~ in a microaerobic atmosphere (80% N2, 10% H2, and 10% CO2) in vented jars for 3-7 days. Bacteria are identified as H. mustelae on the basis of Gram-stain morphology; production of urease, catalase, and oxidase; resistance to cephalothin; and sensitivity to nalidixic acid.",

A superficial gastritis present in the body of the stomach showed that H. mustelae was located on the surface of the mucosa but not in the crypts. Inflammation occupied the full thickness of the distal antral mucosa, the so-called diffuse antral gastritis described in humans (Fig. 2a,b) . In this location, H. mustelae was seen at the surface, in the pits, and on the superficial portion of the glands. In the proximal antrum and the transitional mucosa, focal glandular atrophy, a precancerous lesion, and regeneration were present, in addition to those lesions seen in the distal antrum. Also, deep colonization of H. mustelae was observed focally in the affected antral glands.",

There is recent documentation of the presence of argyrophilic bacteria, compatible in location and morphology to H. mustelae, within the pyloric mucosa of 2 male ferrets with pyloric adenocarcinoma . In humans, epidemiologic data strongly support the association between H. pylori and development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Similarly, we have recently documented a series of H. mustelae-infected ferrets with gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma that parallels the same syndi'ome found in humans. Lymphoma was diagnosed in the wall of the lesser curvature of the pyloric antrum, corresponding to the predominant focus ofH. mustelaeinduced gastritis in ferrets. Gastric lymphomas demonstrated characteristic lymphoepithelial lesions, and the lymphoid cells were IgG positive in all ferrets (Erdman et al., 1997) . These findings and their parallels in H. pylori-infected humans implicate the involvement of H. mustelae in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer in ferrets. Treatment. Studies in ferrets indicate that triple therapy consisting of oral amoxicillin (30 mg/kg), metronidazole (20 mg/ kg), and bismuth subsalicylate (17.5 mg/kg) (Pepto-Bismol original formula, Procter and Gamble) 3 times a day for 3-4 weeks has successfully eradicated H. mustelae . Clinical improvement, including increased appetite and resolution of melena, may occur within 48 hr of initiation of triple therapy. A new treatment regimen being used to eradicate H. pylori in humans has also been used successfully for eradication of H. mustelae from ferrets . Ferrets received 24 mg/kg ranitidine bismuth and 12.5 mg/kg clarithromycin per os 3 times daily for 2 weeks. Culture of tissue collected by gastric endoscopic biopsy at 16, 32, and 43 weeks after termination of treatment indicated that long-term eradication was achieved in all 6 ferrets. Eradication was associated with decrease in anti-H, mustelae IgG antibody titers, results that are consistent with findings in humans after H. pylori eradication.",

Studies involving experimental inoculation with S. enteritidis, S. newport, and S. choleraesuis via the oral route to healthy, distemper-infected, and feed-depleted ferrets and mink showed a fairly high resistance to infection (Gorham et al., 1949) . Only 2 animals of 29 in the diet-restricted group--1 ferret and 1 minknshowed clinical signs of infection after feeding S. newport culture. Signs included lethargy, anorexia, trembling, and fecal blood. The gastrointestinal tract showed a large amount of mucus containing red blood cells; bits of desquamated epithelium and few mononuclear cells overlying the gastric mucosa; an exudate in the small intestine consisting of mu-coid material, red blood cells, and desquamated small intestinal villi; edematous villi in the ileum; and a diffuse infiltrate of the small intestinal mucosa with lymphocytes and macrophages. Necrotic foci in the liver, spleen, and, less commonly, the kidney, as well as splenomegaly and visceral lymphadenopathy, were observed in chronic fatal infections (Coburn and Morris, 1949) .

Oral antibiotic administration to kits nursing affected jills is recommended (Bell, 1997a) . Surgical resection and debridement of affected glands and supportive care may be necessary for jills with acute mastitis. Supplementation of kits with milk replacer may also be necessary, because jills with acute mastitis are reluctant to nurse, and jills with the chronic form have diminished lactation as milk-producing tissue is replaced by scar tissue (Bell, 1997a) . Maintaining thorough personal hygiene practices when handling affected jills is important in minimizing spread to other lactating jills. Cross-fostering kits may be required; however, kits may spread infection to healthy jills. It is reported that jills with the chronic form of mastitis should be culled (Bell, 1997a ).",

Any jill with 15 or more kits may develop pregnancy toxemia because abdominal space is not adequate for both the gravid uterus and the volume of food required to support it. Pregnancy toxemia of the ferret is of the metabolic type and shares features with similar conditions in pregnant sheep, obese cattle, pregnant camelids, obese guinea pigs, and starved pregnant rats, as well as with the condition feline idiopathic hepatic lipidosis. It is characterized by abnormal energy metabolism with consequent hyperlipidemia, hypoglycemia, ketosis, and hepatic lipidosis. In this condition, energy demand exceeds intake, leading to excessive mobilization of free fatty acids and a chain of metabolic events that culminates in a shift from fatty acid metabolism and export to ketosis and hepatic lipidosis. Clinical signs include anorexia, lethargy, melena, dehydration, and easily epilated hair. Differentials include dystocia, metritis, pyometra, septicemia, renal failure, and Helicobacter mustelae-induced gastric ulcer. In a recent study of ferrets with pregnancy toxemia, consistent clinical chemistry abnormalities included azotemia (100%), hypocalcemia (83 %), hypoproteinemia (70%), and elevated liver enzymes (100%) (Batchelder et al., 1999) .

Jills that remain in estrus for more than 1 month are at risk for developing estrogeninduced anemia. Hyperestrogenism from persistent estrus causes bone marrow hypoplasia of all cell lines in approximately half of ferrets in prolonged estrus (Ryland et al., 1983) . Clinical signs include vulvar enlargement, bilaterally symmetric alopecia of the tail and abdomen, weakness, anorexia, depression, lethargy, weight loss, bacterial infection, and mucopurulent vaginal discharge. Hematology findings may vary from an initial neutrophilia and thrombocytosis early in the disease course to lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. The anemia begins as normocytic normochromic but progresses to macrocytic hypochromic (Sherrill and Gorham, 1985) . Coagulopathy associated with hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia combine to produce extensive manifestations of bleeding, pallor, melena, petechiation or ecchymosis, subdural hematoma, and hematomyelia (Hart, 1985; Fox and Bell, 1998) . At necropsy, tissue pallor, light tan to pale pink bone marrow, hemorrhage, bronchopneumonia, hydrometra, pyometra, and mucopurulent vaginitis may be seen. Histopathology may reveal cystic endometrial hypoplasia, hemosiderosis, diminished splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis, and mild to moderate hepatic lipidosis (Sherrill and Gorham, 1985; Bell, 1997a) . Treatment consists of terminating estrus while supporting the animal with antibiotics, blood transfusion, B vitamins, and nutritional supplementation. Estrus may be terminated by injection with 50-100 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 20 ~tg of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), repeated 1 week after initial injection if required. Ovariohysterectomy may be considered for ferrets that are stable and have adequate numbers of platelets and red cells. Ferrets with a packed cell volume (PCV) of 25% or greater have a good prognosis and require only termination of estrus for resolution of aplastic anemia. Jills with a PCV of 15-25% may require blood transfusions and have a guarded prognosis. Ferrets with a PCV of less than 15% have a poor prognosis and require aggressive therapy with multiple transfusions. The lack of identifiable blood groups in ferrets makes multiple transfusions uncomplicated by potential transfusion reactions .",

Detailed dissection with fine scissors and forceps under a heat lamp or on a heated surface can free the kits.

Nonspecific presenting signs include weight loss, vomiting, and ataxia. Weakness is often evident, ranging from lethargy to posterior paresis or outright collapse (Caplan et al., 1996) . Hypoglycemia caused by excess production of insulin by neoplastic 13 cells may cause tremors, disorientation, or seizures (Fox and Marini, 1998) . Excessive salivation (ptyalism) or pawing at the mouth is a frequent finding. Clinical signs are often intermittent or episodic. Other common findings include splenomegaly and lymphocytosis. Presumptive diagnosis is made based on clinical signs in conjunction with the demonstration of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose determinations for the diagnosis of insulinoma are most useful when taken after a 4 hr fasting period. Fasting glucose concentrations below 60 may be diagnostic for the condition (Quesenberry and Rosenthal, 1997) , whereas values between 60 and 85 are suspect and the test should be repeated (Fox and Marini, 1998) .",

Elevation of adrenal sex hormones (e.g., androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and/or estradiol) is more likely, and these may lead to characteristic changes such as estruslike vulvar swelling in spayed females and prostatic changes in males Coleman et al., 1998) .

In one retrospective survey of our necropsy records it was found that more than 90% of ferrets greater than 4 years of age had hyperplastic or neoplastic adrenal changes when examined (data not shown). For this reason, careful considerations of other possible disease processes should be made before attributing clinical signs solely to adrenal enlargement.",

Ferrets younger than 2 years of age often present with mediastinal lymphoma and/or leukemia, whereas those older than 3 years of age often develop multicentric solid tumors . The early age of onset in some ferrets and reports of case clustering have led to investigation into potential infectious etiologies for lymphoma in the ferret (Erdman et al., 1996b) . Earlier reports of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) seroconversion in affected animals have not been substantiated. However, experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests that a retrovirus that is distinct from FeLV may be involved . In one study, whole or filtered lymphoma cells from a 3-year-old ferret with spontaneous lymphoma were injected IP into 6 recipient ferrets . Two of the 6 ferrets were euthanized after 14 months, but the remaining 4 developed splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, and lymphoma. One ferret that received cell-free materials developed multicentric lymphoma with prominent cutaneous lymphoma nodules. Elevated reverse transcriptase activity and retrovirus-like particles evident by electron microscopy were seen in the donor and all of the affected recipient ferrets.",

Histologic examination of affected organs has revealed that the most common cause for splenic enlargement (in the absence of a neoplastic infiltrate) is extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) (Erdman et al., 1998) . This may be an incidental finding, but it has been suggested that in some cases a pathologically enlarged spleen may play a role in chronic anemia that may respond to splenectomy, a syndrome known as hypersplenism (Ferguson, 1985) . Splenomegaly can also be commonly found in conjunction with lymphoma, with or without intrasplenic neoplastic lymphoid accumulations. In anesthetized ferrets, splenomegaly may be caused by splenic sequestration of erythrocytes (Marini et al., 1994 (Marini et al., , 1997 .

Presenting signs for this syndrome generally include chronic weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, and occasionally vomiting. Eosinophilic granulomas have been found in the mesenteric lymph nodes of most affected ferrets, and in some cases other organs (e.g., lung or liver) may be involved. An interesting finding in many ferrets is the presence of Splendore-Hoeppli material in the inflamed lymph nodes, a histological phenomenon that has been associated in other species with helminths, bacteria, fungi, and foreign bodies (Fig. 12 ). An etiological agent has not been identified; consequently, therapy consists largely of supportive care to treat the chronic enteritis (Fox, 1998b) . Based on the biology of eosinophils, however, the use of corticosteroids or ivermectin has been attempted and may be beneficial (Bell, 1997b) .",

The cause is generally unknown, and the prognosis is poor, despite efforts at supportive care (Blanco et al., 1994) . Gray, yellow, or white small raised lesions may be found on the surface of ferret lungs at gross examination. Histologically, these lesions are composed of a superficial thickening of the lung tissue with mononuclear cell infiltration and varying degrees of fibrosis, with or without cholesterol-like clefts. The etiology of this condition (known as subpleural histiocytosis, pleural lipidosis, or lipid pneumonia) is unknown, and it appears to be an incidental lesion (Fox, 1998f) . ",
