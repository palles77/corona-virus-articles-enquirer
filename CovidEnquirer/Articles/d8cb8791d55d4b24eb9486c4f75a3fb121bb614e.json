These benefits include an increased titer of serum antibodies to feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA). High titers of serum antibody to FOCMA in FeLV cats have been associated with resistance to FeLV-related neoplasias',4. Nine cats that tested negative before treatment tested positive [ 3 1 : 10 serum dilution, geometric mean titer (GMT)=2781 for antibody to FOCMA after DEC treatment. Among 19 cats initially testing positive for FOCMA antibody, higher titers were noted after treatment in 17 (pretreatment GMT of 19 cats = 264, post-treatment GMT = 6158)'. Administration of DEC for 2 weeks after one dose of FeLV vaccine increased the titer and duration of tCorrespondence should be addressed to Dr L. W. Kttchen These experiments were prompted by data from two earlier investigations suggesting that DEC has an opsonic effect on microfilariae. First, the in viva use of DEC resulted in a rapid fall of circulating microfilariae in cotton rats experimentally infected with Litomosoides curinii due to hepatic sequestration'.",

First, could DEC be of benefit in preventing/treating retroviral infections, either alone or in combination with antiretroviral drugs such as 3'-Azido-3deoxythymidine (AZT)? Second, will the widely-practiced use of DEC as an antifilarial agent among some African populations alter the serologic outcomes of Africans enrolled in HIV vaccine trials?

DEC may less dramatically/consistently improve detection of antibodies to HIV because such patients' serum samples may also contain HIV antigens. and DEC may enhance binding of HIV antibodies with HIV serum antigens, in addition to HIV antigens used in commercial assays. However. DEC h vitro increases absorbance values generated by HIV antibody testing of serum samples by EIA from (1) patients with AIDS-related disease. (2) patients who test positive for ewr gene-encoded glycoproteins (gp120 and gpl60) but not gag gene-encoded proteins (~24 and ~55) of HIV-I, and (3) patients with ~500 T-helper lymphocytes per mm' blood. These three groups include significantly immunocompromised HIV-l infected patients\". One possible explanation for the above findings is that the rate of in viw HIV-I genetic changes-approximately IO ? to 1 O-' nucleotide substitutions per site per year for env and IO-fold fewer for gq may prevent HIV-infected immunocompromised patients from mounting an optimal serologic response in the late stages of HIV infection\". Such patients' serum samples could contain antibodies that do not bind circulating variant HIV glycoprotein antigens. but can bind less variant HIV glycoproteins used in commercial kits, and DEC could enhance the latter process. This hypothesis could also explain why the gpl60 bands on Western blots using serum samples from four of seven AIDS patients were slightly intensified when DEC was added in vitro. In this regard, the use of DEC in vitro to optimize detection of antibody to HIV-l glycoproteins may be important to the successful differential diagnosis of patients with AIDS or AIDS-related diseases, or immunocompromised HIV-l infected patients, since such patients may have low amounts of antibody to gpl20 and gpl60 and even lower or undetectable amounts of antibody to p24 or ~55.",

Whether DEC increases retroviral antigen-immune host cell interactions resulting in increased humoral responses, as has been shown in connection with DEC treatment of humans with filariasis'\", requires further study; this effect appears likely since DEC increases FOCMA antibody titers in FeLV-vaccinated cats. The mechanisms by which DEC might enhance antigen--antibody and antigen-immune host ceil interactions are unknown. Since in vivo DEC treatment alters titers of serum antibody to nonretroviruses such as FIP5, our results also may have implications for strategies to improve assays for some antibodies to non-retroviral infectious agents or related antigens.",
