The hot water humidifiers (HWH) heat the water, thus allowing the water vapor to heat and humidify the medical gases. In the common HWH there is a contact between the medical gases and the sterile water, thus increasing the risk of patient's colonization and infection. Recently to avoid the condensation in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, new heated ventilator circuits have been developed. In this in vitro study we evaluated the efficiency (absolute/relative humidity) of three HWH: (1) a common HWH without a heated ventilator circuit (MR 730, Fisher&Paykel, New Zeland), (2) the same HWH with a heated ventilator circuit (Mallinckrodt Dar, Italy) and (3) a new HWH (DAR HC 2000, Mallinkckrodt Dar, Italy) with a heated ventilator circuit in which the water vapor reaches the medical gases through a gorotex membrane, avoiding any direct contact between the water and gases. At a temperature of 35\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C the HWH and heated tube were evaluated.",

In this study, use of IPV during the first three postoperative days reduces hospital LOS after cardiac surgery. However, a larger study is necessary to confirm these results. To measure it we used a direct method with certain technical innovations. The subjects breathed through an oronasal mask and one-way valve. Expired air was collected in a 5-l balloon in order to provide adequate mixture of dead space and alveolar air. The concentration of CO 2 on the end of the balloon (PECO 2 ) was measured with an RGM 'Ohmeda' capnograph (infrared technique) together with minute ventilation. Arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO 2 ) was measured simultaneously from arterial blood using a conventional method.",

            "text": "A proteomics approach to ventilator-induced lung injury might identify protein patterns that contribute to epithelial injury. To identify changes in alveolar type II cells (ATII), rats were mechanically ventilated for 5 hours with a high tidal volume (HTV; 20 ml/kg, no positive end expiratory pressure) or a low tidal volume (LTV; 6 ml/kg, positive end expiratory pressure 4 cmH 2 O) and compared with pooled controls without mechanical ventilation (SV). ATII were isolated and lysed. Protein expression was compared using the recently introduced cleavable isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT) methodology. After tryptic digestion, cysteine containing peptides were tagged with biotin, extracted using an avidin-coated column and identified by HPLC and mass spectrometry with collision-induced dissociation. Spectra were interrogated against the Swissprot database and quantified using the ProteinProspector software. HTV ventilation resulted in morphologic changes, pulmonary edema and neutrophil influx in the lung. Quantization showed differential expression of several hundred proteins following both HTV and LTV ventilation. Most proteins were upregulated by LTV ventilation compared with SV. For some proteins, upregulation was markedly attenuated after HTV compared with LTV. This was not true for ICAM-1, which correlated with the increased number of neutrophils in these samples. After HTV, surfactant proteins B and D followed different patterns. Since the differentially expressed proteins play important roles in innate immunity and in pulmonary edema fluid clearance, the attenuated response of ATII after HTV ventilation might indicate a clinically relevant impediment. P25 Inspiratory vs expiratory limb of the pressure-volume curve for the positive end-expiratory pressure setting in acute lung injury Results Pressure-controlled or pressure support MV modes were most often used (97.7%). No differences were seen between the four MV modes (ASV, IPPV, ASB and PC) with respect to applied Vt and PEEP. Higher levels of PEEP were used in ARDS patients (P = 0.002). Importantly, in the majority of patients Vt was > 8 ml/kg. Moreover, Vt was significantly higher in ARDS patients than in non-ARDS patients (P = 0.002).",

Twenty-eight patients (70%) were transplanted and 24 survived to hospital discharge. Of the 12 nontransplant patients only one survived. A diagnosis compatible with ALI was found in 23%, with no difference between transplant and nontransplant patients. The median PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (P/F) was 167 in ALI patients against 283 in nonlung injury patients (Mann-Whitney U test, not significant). Only two patients (5%) were taken off the transplant list due to a combination of refractory hypoxia and multiple organ failure. Transplant and nontransplant patients did not differ in terms of P/F, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), EVLWI or permeability index. Poor outcome was not associated with low P/F, CXR signs of ALI, high EVLWI or permeability index. Bilateral infiltrates on CXR correlated with PEEP (P = 0.004), EVLWI (P = 0.001) and permeability index (P < 0.001) but not with P/F. Focal lung infiltrates did not correlate with the above parameters. Twelve patients without CXR findings of ALI had significant impaired gas exchange P/F < 200, suggesting an extrapulmonary reason for hypoxia.",

Pulmonary function was evaluated at the latest by the fourth day of hospitalization, using the Lung Injury Score (LIS) with the following components: chest radiographic findings, PaO 2 /FiO 2 and positive end expiratory pressure. A LIS of zero was defined as normal pulmonary function, a LIS of 0.1-2.5 as mild to moderate dysfunction, while a LIS of more than 2.5 as severe pulmonary dysfunction. The maximum LIS was taken in consideration for statistical analysis. The patients' brain computerised tomography (CT) scan on admission was graded using the Marshall CT scoring system. The Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) was used after a 30-day follow-up of the population, as good recovery (1), moderate disability (2), severe disability (3), vegetative state (4), death (5)considering good outcome as (1) and (2) and bad outcome as (3), (4) and (5) .

            "text": "Although endotoxin is frequently used as a model to study sepsis-associated effects, an endotoxin-induced increase in microvascular permeability in vivo could not be detected by three different methods. Endotoxin administration to human volunteers is not suitable as a model to study changes in microvascular permeability. Experimental studies using a peritonitis model of sepsis in rats have reported abnormalities in microvascular perfusion including increased stopped flow capillaries, increased fast flow capillaries and impaired regulation of blood flow. We have used a spectrophotometric functional microvascular imaging system to quantify capillary geometry, red blood cell flow and red blood cell hemoglobin oxygen saturation during sepsis. We found that while oxygen saturation at the entrance of the capillary bed was unaffected in sepsis, there was a significant drop in saturation at the venous end of capillaries with normal velocities. Although the fall in oxygen saturation correlated with the number of stopped flow capillaries, we could not determine from this data whether tissue oxygen consumption changed with sepsis, whether fast flow capillaries acted as functional oxygen shunts or whether any regions of the tissue were anoxic. To address these questions we constructed a computational model that simulated O 2 transport in a three-dimensional volume of tissue supplied by heterogeneously spaced capillaries with fast, normal and stopped flow. The model was based on our experimental oxygen transport data (capillary density, number of stopped flow capillaries, capillary red blood cell velocity and supply rate, and entrance oxygen saturation levels) and the model predicted oxygen consumption, tissue oxygen levels and oxygen transport in fast flow capillaries; data that could not be measured experimentally with current technology. Tissue oxygen consumption in the model was adjusted to yield the same venous end oxygen saturation values as measured experimentally. Two cases were modeled; average sepsis (AS) with 33% stopped, 33% normal and 33% fast flow, and extreme sepsis (ES) with 50% stopped, 25% normal and 25% fast flow. Simulations found approximately twofold and fourfold increases in tissue oxygen consumption for AS and ES, respectively. Average (minimum) tissue PO 2 decreased from 43 (40) mmHg in control to 34 (27) and 26 (15) mmHg in AS and ES, respectively. Clustering fast flow capillaries to increase flow heterogeneity resulted in only a slight decrease in minimum tissue PO 2 , to 14.5 mmHg. Although fast flow capillaries did appear to be oxygen shunts with higher venous oxygen saturations, they were a significant factor in preventing tissue anoxia during sepsis. Despite the contribution of fast flow capillaries, simulated tissue PO 2 values continued to fall as the degree of microvascular injury increased. The model predicts that microvascular oxygen transport abnormalities associated with sepsis expose the tissue to local regions of a hypoxic environment that may lead ultimately to significant changes in cellular function.",

In septic shock patients, however, the relation between cardiac output and \u2206PCO 2 is quite complex due to possible distributive abnormalities of macrocirculatory and microcirculatory blood flow. The objectives of this study was to determine whether there is a good correlation between cardiac output and \u2206PCO 2 in a group of septic shock patients and between \u2206PCO 2 , base excess (BE) and arterial lactate concentration (LAC), these two latter already demonstrated as good predictors of mortality in critically ill patients.",

At the therapeutic dose, levosimendan acts predominantly as a calcium sensitizer and ATP-sensitive K + -channel (KATPchannel) opener. It binds directly to the calcium-dependent site on troponin C, stabilizing the calcium-induced conformational change and enhances the calcium sensitivity of the cardiac myofilaments.

These promising initial results await confirmation in the ongoing REVIVE II trial. A total of 100 patients who were hospitalized for worsening HF and had dyspnea at rest despite IV diuretics were randomized (double-blind) to receive placebo (PBO) (n = 49) or IV levosimendan (LS) (n = 51), given as a loading dose of 12 \u00b5g/kg over 10 min and followed by a continuous infusion (0.1 \u00b5g/kg/hour for 50 min and 0.2 \u00b5g/kg/hour for 23 hours); patients were then followed closely for an additional 4 days. Patients were classified as improved if they reported their HF to be moderately or markedly improved at specific timepoints. Patients were classified as worse if they died or received an IV medication for worsening HF during the 5-day study period. Patients were considered unchanged if they were neither improved nor worse.

A significant correlation between fT4 at admission and survival was found, but only in the septic shock subgroup. The decrease in fT3 is involved in the decrease in AT, reliable to gravity and prognosis. A physiopathological explanation in sepsis could imply NF-\u03baB. Measurement of AT realized in septic patients could be usefully completed by fT3 measurement. Heparinised venous blood samples were obtained from 10 healthy adult volunteers, and PMNL were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and suspended in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% autologous plasma. Cells were incubated for 16 hours with either 2 \u00b5g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (stimulated) or phosphate-buffered saline (unstimulated) in the presence of r-SPC or EI, or both. Cells were washed and treated with Annexin V/propidium iodide stains and analysed by dual-laser flow cytometry. The percentage of early apoptotic cells was determined using four-quadrant analysis. Data were analysed using Friedman analysis of variance with post hoc testing by Wilcoxon signed ranks testing for paired data ( Table 1) .",

Background The family of natriuretic peptides comprises several structurally related 22-53 amino acid peptides, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), which are vasoactive peptides that have vasodilator and diuretic properties and play an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis. The salutary cardiovascular effects of natriuretic peptides suggest that ANP and BNP have a pathophysiological significance in cardiac depression in septic patients. Aim of the present study was to determine plasma levels of the stable N-terminal prohormone forms of ANP (Nt-proANP) and BNP (Nt-proBNP) in septic patients treated with and without Drotrecogin alfa (activated).

Patients suffering from SS have to be treated at an early stage of sepsis. Introduction Neuroaxial anaesthesia reduces the risk of postoperative complications, but in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery the benefits of neuroaxial anaesthesia are less clear [1, 2] . A significant proportion of patients develop sepsis following laparotomy. Recently Drotrecogin alfa (activated) has been shown to reduce the risk of death from sepsis [3] . Due to the increased risk of bleeding the presence of a neuroaxial catheter is an absolute contraindication to its use. We hypothesized that the presence of a neuroaxial catheter excludes a significant number of septic patients from receiving this potentially beneficial therapy.",

The main reason for ICU admission of TP patients were acute respiratory failure (n = 37), shock (n = 21), sepsis (n = 18), coma (n = 13), acute renal failure (n = 12), metabolic disorders (n = 9), scheduled surgery (n = 5), acute poisoning (n = 4), trauma (n = 3), miscellaneous causes (n = 4). In the overall population, the mean platelet count upon admission was 314 \u00b1 114 G/l. TP was observed in 126/325 (39%) and present on admission in 89 patients, with a mean count of 97 \u00b1 340 G/l. ICU-acquired TP occurred with a median delay of 4.7 days (range 2-26 days) in 37/126. The ICU mortality was 29% (n = 37) in the TP population and 9% (n = 19) in the nonTP population. Bone marrow aspiration was performed in 35/126 TP patients. Before TP, a previous red blood cell (RBC) transfusion was recorded in seven cases, a previous plasma infusion in two cases, and prior exposure to heparin in 25 cases. The diagnosis of heparin-induced TP was excluded in 17/25 cases, unlikely in three cases, possible in three cases and very likely in two cases. TP was related to sepsis in 51 cases, to disseminated intravascular coagulation in 28 cases (among these, 14 were associated with sepsis), to central megacaryocyte depletion in five cases, and to hemophagocytic histiocytosis in four cases. A combination of two or more of these mechanisms was observed in 23 cases. In 57 patients, the etiology of TP was undetermined or related to another cause. In univariate analysis, TP was significantly associated (all P < 0.01) with higher SAPS II score (50 \u00b1 22 vs 40 \u00b1 20), higher SOA score (8.6 \u00b1 4.3 vs 4.7 \u00b1 4), need for renal replacement therapy (39% vs 20%), need for invasive mechanical ventilation (51% vs 36%), higher length of stay (11 \u00b1 13 days vs 7 \u00b1 6 days) and ICU mortality (29% vs 9%). No statistical difference was detected in patient characteristics between the two TP populations (TP present on admission or ICU acquired).

However, it is also possible that routine laboratory measurements are not sensitive enough indicators of appropriateness for this patient population; that is, patients frequently may have active bleeding without the opportunity for laboratory samples to be obtained. The potential causes for the former include lack of knowledge of the existing guidelines, decision of not to follow the guidelines, or overcorrection of coagulopathy. Possible solutions include: the redistribution of guidelines to various departments of a hospital (operating room, emergency room, critical care); cell saver techniques; accepting lower blood pressures in select patients; use of antifibrinolytics; use of factor VIIa. Regrettably, the trauma patient population is a heterogeneous group of patients and, similar to therapeutic trials in sepsis, trauma patients represent a group with an extremely high morbidity and mortality incidence that can potentially complicate interpreting data.",

This study was undertaken over 3 years (January 2000-March 2003) and included 58 consecutive patients hospitalized for major trauma (defined as Injury Severity Score > 15) requiring intubation at the roadside and in whom the prehospital petCO 2 had been recorded. Patients younger than 16 years old were excluded from the study. There were 48 males and 10 females. Methods Sixteen patients with SCH-B in middle and end stages underwent MARS therapy as the MARS treatment group. A retrospective review of 16 patients chosen from previous therapy data, also of SCH-B and clinically matched to the MARS group, were regarded as the standard medical therapy (SMT) group, who had been treated with general methods except MARS. The prognosis of the two groups were studied and the treatment effects on levels of serum total bilirubin, nonconjugated bilirubin and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were observed in the MARS group during a single 6-8 hour MARS treatment.",

Laboratory data included the initial and peak creatine kinase (CK), the anion gap, calcium, phosphate, potassium, blood urea nitroben (BUN), white blood cell count (WBC), urine toxicology screen, and hematocrit. A second hematocrit collected following hydration was compared with the first to approximate the percentage of initial volume depletion. A second creatinine was also taken following hydration (median 10 hours after admission). Patients with obvious renal insufficiency defined as a creatinine > 4 mg/dl (354 \u00b5m/l) and patients with peak CK < 1000 were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed using small STATA 7.0. For continuous variables, data were dichotomized based on an upper limit of normal values (phosphate, potassium, BUN) or low limit (calcium); and median values of the anion gap, hematocrit, percentage decrease in hematocrit, WBC, and CK.",

According to our experience SLEDD can be considered a safe and efficacious treatment for these patients: it allows an aggressive volemic removal and an adequate nutritional support coupled with haemodynamic stability and uremic control. The logistic regression shows that age, severity of illness and amount of organs affected were independent risk factors for poor outcome. Acute renal failure (ARF) is common in critical care patients. One risk factor for ARF is age. However, access to dialysis is often limited in older patients, due to their worse prognosis. We report our experience in dialyzing old patients, and compare them with younger patients with ARF in our unit. Since September 1994, we recorded all dialyzed patients, treated with intermittent dialysis (IHD), continuous dialysis (CRRT) or both, depending on clinical decisions. For IHD we use a Fresenius 4008 E machine and polysulfone dialyzers. For CRRT, we first used a DM 08 Fresenius machine and, from 2001, a Diapact-CRRT Braun machine, with polysulfone hemofilters. Since 1994, we have had 163 patients, 68.4% males, mean age 60 (range 15-92) years. Mean APACHE II score at admission was 21.6.

We specifically wanted to test the hypothesis that perfusion deficiency could be detected by regional venous to arterial CO 2 content gradients (as opposed to pCO 2 gradients). Conclusions EPI, unlike NE, induced an overall relative reduction of splanchnic blood flow and specifically reduced gastric wall perfusion as evaluated by regional CO 2 content gradients. The lactate gradient and L/P ratio over the gastric wall increased accordingly. These findings suggest that EPI should not be used as a first-line vasopressor in septic shock.",

The incidence of respiratory failure in that period was significantly higher in the DAE group (73.3%) than in the DAN group (16.7%) (P < 0.01), and that of renal failure was also significantly higher in the DAE group (33.3%) than in the DAN group (0%)(P < 0.01).

These observations suggested that determination of plasma levels of SE might be useful for prediction of the development of organ failures, especially that of respiratory and renal failure, and the outcome of such patients with SIRS might have the potential risk for development of multiorgan failure.

Methods We simulated an interventional trial of a neutralizing body against tissue necrosis factor (anti-TNF) in sepsis based on a mechanistic mathematical model that includes a bacterial infection, the host response, and a therapeutic intervention. Simulated cases differed by bacterial load and virulence, as well as individual propensity to mount and modulate an inflammatory response. We submitted 1000 cases to three doses and durations of anti-TNF, and present the results of the simulation. To evaluate the usefulness of modeling to improve patient selection, we constructed a logistic model with a four-valued outcome: (1) helped by treatment, (2) survives irrespective of treatment, (3) dies irrespective of treatment, and (4) harmed by treatment.

Included were all patients who required mechanical ventilation for 12 hours or more. At admission to the ICU patients were randomized ito two groups: one group was suctioned with CESS, and another group with OESS. VAP was defined according to the following criteria: a chest radiographic examination showing new or progressive infiltrate; new onset of purulent sputum; significant quantitative culture of pathogen from respiratory secretions (tracheal aspirate > 10 6 cfu/ml, bronchoalveolar lavage > 10 4 cfu/ml or protected bronchial brush catheter > 10 3 cfu/ml). The statistical analysis was realized by the chi-square test and the Student t test, and we took P < 0.05 to consider a significant difference. Conclusions We conclude that in our series, the CTSS did not reduce the ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence, nor the exogenous pneumonia. Background CPIS is an accepted tool for clinical estimation of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), encompassing five components: temperature, blood leukocytes, tracheal secretions, oxygenation index and chest roentgenogram. VAP is considered a frequent complication in mechanically ventilated severe polytrauma patients. There are some current issues that highlight the influence of VAP development on patient mortality [1] . The aim of this study was to evaluate VAP development in severe polytrauma patients according to CPIS criteria and on that basis to determine the patients' clinical course.",

Introduction and aims Nosocomial bloodstream fungal infections by Candida species in ICU has risen dramatically in the past two decades. In fact, fungal infections in the critically ill patient are difficult to diagnose and are associated with a high mortality rate. The high concentration of some proinflammatory cytokines registered in the serum and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of patients with severe bronchopneumonia and the different kind of host response during fungal infections are well defined. Our aim is to correlate the IL-10 serum and BAL levels in criticaly ill patients with confirmed bronchopneumonia associated with candidiasis or bacterial sepsis and to research whether these levels consent to prove the fungal origin of severe pneumonia associated with severe sepsis.",

This data substantiated the anecdotal knowledge on the relationship between paracetamol (acetaminophen) and hypotension in the critically ill and associated it with the IV preparation. This prospective, randomized and controlled study aimed to compare the efficacy of two methods for analgesia in patients with chest trauma and rib fractures: continuous epidural catheter analgesia and regional intrapleural analgesia (RIPA). Seventy-three patients with unilateral chest trauma were randomized into two groups. In Group 1 patients we placed an epidural catheter (level -TH 8-10), and in Group 2 patients we placed an intrapleural catheter (level -fifth intercostal space). We used 1% lidocain for analgesia in both groups. The control group received intravenous analgesia with opioid. We applied 10 ml lidocain bolus to the intrapleural catheter four to six times per 24 hours and clamped the catheter for 10 min. For epidural analgesia we applied 50-100 mg lidocain and started continuous infusion at a rate of 2-3 mg/kg/hour, not exceeding a dose 400 mg lidocain per 24 hours. We monitored the level of thermohipanesthesia, the level of analgesia (Visual Aanalogue Scale -10 points), parameters of respiratory and cardiovascular function (respiratory rate, arterial O 2 oxygen saturation [SaO 2 ], heart rate, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, ability to expectorate). Thermohipanesthesia was unilateral and significantly shorter in Group 2 patients, whereas in Group 1 patients it was bilateral and of longer duration. The level of analgesia was similar in both groups (0-4 points) but in Group 2 patients it was achieved by more frequent applications of lidocain, which potentially is dangerous for toxicity. The respiratory rate decreased, O 2 and SaO 2 increased, and the ability to expectorate was improved. In Group 2 patients the heart rate and arterial blood pressure remained stable, and in Group 1 patients there were episodes of tachycardia and hypotension, which is undesirable in trauma patients. The technique of placing an intrapleural catheter is easier.",

We report safety monitoring in our ongoing prospective, double-blind, randomised controlled study (the Does Additional Glucose Make A Difference? trial) investigating whether initial additional glucose infusion improves outcome in critical care patients receiving a 'tight' glycaemic control. Patients received 50% glucose or 0.9% NaCl at 20 ml/hour until full nutrition was taken. We monitored for excess hypoglycaemic episodes in our NaCl group.

These patients may benefit from early steroid replacement therapy. The objective of this study was to investigate the functional integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in critical illness by stimulating with the low-dose ACTH stimulation test (LDST) and hCRH. The study included 16 (15 male) mechanically ventilated patients, having a mean age of 52 \u00b1 19 years. Underlying diagnoses included major operation (n = 7), multiple trauma (n = 5), stroke (n = 3), and pancreatitis (n = 1). Patients were enrolled in the study 3-14 days after initiation of mechanical ventilation. Median APACHE II and SOFA scores at the study day were 13 (range: 8-23) and 5.5 (range: 4-12), respectively. All patients underwent stimulation first with the LDST (1 \u00b5g) and then on the following day with 100 \u00b5g hCRH. ACTH and cortisol concentrations were determined from -15 to 120 min after hCRH. Normal cortisol responses to the LDST and hCRH were defined as peak plasma concentrations above 18 \u00b5g/dl and 20 \u00b5g/dl, respectively. An appropriate ACTH response to hCRH was considered if a twofold increase in ACTH was observed. In the entire patient population, baseline cortisol (mean \u00b1 SD) was 15.1 \u00b1 7.1 \u00b5g/dl and stimulated cortisol (median) was 21.4 \u00b5g/dl following the LDST. Four (25%) of the 16 patients had subnormal stimulated cortisol levels after the LDST. These four patients also had subnormal peak cortisol concentrations following hCRH.",

This disorder is mostly due to primary adrenal dysfunction, but also to hypothalamic-pituitary failure. The aim of the study was to determine the status of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in critically ill patients with early sepsis and/or septic shock and to investigate whether adrenal responses are related to mortality. Forty-two patients (32 male; median age 62 years; range 17-82 years) had cortisol, corticotropin (ACTH) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) levels measured at onset of sepsis and/or septic shock. Adrenal responsiveness was assessed by the LDST. A peak cortisol < 18 \u00b5g/dl on the LDST was considered as representing an inadequate response. For the entire patient population, hormone concentrations were as follows (median or mean \u00b1 SD values): baseline cortisol 17.8 \u00b5g/dl, stimulated cortisol 24.8 \u00b1 9.4 \u00b5g/dl, increment in cortisol 5.9 \u00b1 4.4 \u00b5g/dl, ACTH 21.2 pg/ml and DHEAS 1553 \u00b1 1157 ng/ml. Eight (19%) of the 42 patients had inadequate cortisol responses following the LDST. Overall, 21 patients died and 21 patients survived.

Conclusions We suggest that plasma potassium is more reliable than serum potassium in the critically ill, since the latter depends on the platelet count. We should evaluate the patient and act according to the plasma levels, since pseudohyperkalemia is more likely, even for normal platelet counts.The higher Spdif observed in the critically ill implies that a number of their platelets is not counted with conventional methods, probably because they are activated and aggregate during the initiation of the acute phase reaction.

The aim of this study was to compare pulmonary metabolic effects of these two fat emulsions. We prospectively measured intrapulmonary oxygen consumption (VO 2 ipulm), lung lactate production (LLP), glucose flux trough the lung (GF), energy expenditure (EE) and respiratory quotient (RQ) in 26 adult post-traumatic ARDS patients, receiving conventional fat emulsion. At study entry patients were randomly switched from LCT to MCT/LCT lipid emulsion. The patients in the LCT group (n = 13) continued to receive conventional 20% LCTcontaining fat emulsion, and in the MCT/LCT group (n = 13) a 20% MCT-containing fat emulsion was started. In both groups fat emulsion was infused in doses of 1 g/kg/day. VO 2 ipulm was estimated by subtracting the calculated VO 2 using the reverse Fick method from the whole body VO 2 using indirect calorimetry (Datex Ohmeda M-COVX metabolic monitor). All measurements and calculations were performed simultaneously after achieving steadystate conditions in 2-hour periods for 24 hours. The overall mortality in this setting was 64%. We found substantial increases in VO 2 ipulm as a component of the whole body VO 2 in both groups (median 29.3%; interquartile range 26.2-34.1%). In the MCT/LCT group there was an abrupt (mean value 26 \u00b1 11 min) and sustained significant increase in EE (mean 3.4 \u00b1 0.3 kcal/kg) with a maximal corresponding increase in whole body VO 2 on the 6th hour. VO 2 ipulm showed a constant decline, reaching minimum median values of 20.4% (interquartile range 17.1-22.4%) of the whole body VO 2 on the 8th hour. The absolute value of VO 2 ipulm also decreased from 2.1 \u00b1 0.4 ml/kg/min to 1.3 \u00b1 3 ml/kg/min. These changes were not accompanied by significant variations in LLP, GF and RQ. We concluded that the observed decrease in VO 2 ipulm in the MCT/LCT group with concomitant increases in whole body VO 2 and EE without any significant changes in RQ, LLP and GF is indicative for increased oxygen consumption for metabolic purposes outside the lung. These data suggest that infusion of a MCT-containing fat emulsion could lead to a significant decrease of oxygen used by the lung for nonmetabolic purposes (i.e. free radical formation from lipid peroxidation). The observed positive short-term metabolic effects of MCT/LCT-containing fat emulsions could have potential clinical applications in reducing oxidative damage, caused by a large inflammatory mass of the lung in ARDS patients. Recognizing the ischemic effects of sympathomimetic toxins on various vascular beds, we hypothesized that renal insufficiency in the setting of cocaine and amphetamine-related rhabdomolysis is associated with direct ischemic injury to renal tubules that is independent of the extent of muscle damage and volume depletion.",

Our preliminary study found a significant improvement in the proportion of patients surviving to the emergency department following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in NIF-treated patients [2] . Our protocol is as follows: for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with shockresistant VF or pulseless VT (after three or more precordial shocks), epinephrine (1 mg bolus) and then NIF (0.3 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.4 mg/kg/hour infusion) are administered.

We will show the details of the clinical course of successfully recovered patients treated with this protocol. Results AEDs were used for 18 patients.

Thus, the process of teambuilding is associated with a significant delay in crucial measures in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Further research is necessary on how to improve teambuilding in the settings of medical emergencies. Methods A doctor and a nurse who are resuscitation instructors conduct the surprise drills using a computerized simulation mannequin (SIM 4000). The instruction team arrives at the department unannounced, presents a clinical scenario, observes the way in which the department functions during the resuscitation process, and documents its findings. At the end of the exercise, a discussion is held with the department staff concerning the quality of resuscitation implementation. Protocols for treatment of potentially fatal arrhythmias are also reviewed during this session. After the exercise, the department head receives a written report of the quality of the CPR exercise, and recommendations for improving CPR management. Implementing surprise drills supplements the CPR training through which the unified language has been introduced into the hospital.

We have also shown patients with slight head injuries who were conscious (GCS > 8) and whose elevated serum S-100B concentrations decreased in the next 24 hours. We suspect it was only the cerebral cell damage that caused the initial increase of serum S-100B concentrations in these head injuries. If there is no secondary brain damage, serum S-100B concentrations will immediately decrease. The YK-150 (Human S-100B ELISA kit) can measure serum S-100B concentrations in 22 \u00b1 4 hours. Using the YK-150, if we can detect a slight variation in early-phase secondary brain damage, we can accurately predict what changes will take place in the patient; and if so, YK-150's efficacy will spread even further. Background Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of S-100B protein, an acidic calcium-binding protein found in astrocytes and Schwann cells, increase after central nervous system damage. Serum S-100B protein thus has potential as a biomedical marker of brain cell damage. Several reports show a relation between the severity of head injury and serum S-100B protein (S-100B) levels in trauma patients, but there are few data about S-100B in endogenous cerebral disease.",

Introduction Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced around areas of contused brain after head injury [1] . However, since the cerebral metabolism is also reduced this may represent appropriate flowmetabolism coupling, rather than ischaemia. Matching of CBF to metabolism is quantified as the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF).

The fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequence provides cerebrospinal fluid-nulled, T 2 -weighted MRI images, on which oedema is hyperintense. The FLAIR images were coregistered and voxel resized to O-PET-derived maps of CBF and OEF, using a published methodology [2] . Each patient's coregistered FLAIR image was inspected for the largest and most apparent region of pericontusional oedema. These regions were then manually outlined and applied to PET maps, and CBF and OEF in these regions of oedema were calculated. Results were compared with unit reference data obtained from healthy volunteers [3] .",

CPP did not help stratify those patients who survived (Group 1 and Group 2). The question remains whether we can improve outcome with aggressive measures to reduce the ICP or increase the CPP. The Wessex Head Injury Matrix (WHIM) [1] is one of the rare behavioural scales that have been designed to follow the recovery of head-injured patients throughout the whole spectrum of altered states of consciousness, from exit of coma to complete recovery. In this study, we explored the validity of the WHIM in relation to other behavioural assessment tools -Glasgow-Li\u00e8ge Coma Scale (GLS) [2] , Coma-Near Coma scale (CNC) [3] , Western Neuro Sensory Stimulation Profile (WNSSP) [4] -as well as in relation to the Bi-Spectral Index (BIS), derived from electroencephalographic measures. Twenty-nine brain-injured comatose patients (aged 21-83 years) were followed longitudinally with these behavioural and electrophysiological measures. Overall, the evolution of the scores on the WHIM correlated significantly with the evolution of scores obtained by the GLS (r = 0.88; P < 0.01), the CNC (r = -0.8; P < 0.01), the WNSSP (r = 0.87; P < 0.01), as well as with the BIS measure (r = 0.58; P < 0.01). Relative to the GLS, CNC and WNSSP, the WHIM showed a particularly good sensitivity for documenting subtle changes in recovery for patients in a minimally conscious state. The BIS index globally evolved in parallel to the behavioural scales. However, it showed a very bad sensitivity as many patients in a coma or a vegetative state presented BIS scores that were as high as those observed for patients that had regained normal consciousness. The results confirm the usefulness of the WHIM, especially for the assessment of minimally conscious patients. However, even if a global relation is observed with behavioural scales, the validity of electrophysiological measures such as the BIS index is unsatisfactory for the assessment of altered states of consciousness.",

The aim of this study was to adapt standard neuropsychological tests to an eye-response mode for use in LIS patients. We assessed five patients in LIS for 3-6 years (age 24-57 years) and 10 controls with a modified version of the direct and backwards digit span (working memory), the Doors and People Test (episodic memory [1] ), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (executive functioning [2] ), the LEXIS (phonological and lexico-semantic processing [3] ), the EVIP (vocabulary knowledge [4] ) and two new tests designed to measure sustained and selective attention for auditory stimuli. Like the LIS patients, the control subjects had to respond via eye movements. The results showed that the patients' performance was in the normal range for most measures. However, differences of performance between subjects have been found. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a complete neuropsychological testing in chronic LIS survivors.",

Data were prospectively collected during a 3-month period, in two general ICUs of a hospital in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, using a file card to record the occurrences. Patient's severity and nursing workload were evaluated, respectively, by means of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) and the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System-28 (TISS-28). The population of the study consisted of 212 patients, of which 47 (22.0%) were victims of 80 iatrogenic occurrences during their stay at the ICU. Among the victim patients, 57% suffered one occurrence, 28.0% two occurrences and 15.0% three or four occurrences. Regarding the type of event, 27.0% were related to pressure ulcer, followed by 24.0% and 20.0%, respectively, regarding handling of the orotracheal cannula and two blood catheters. The others, occurred during administration of medicaments (13.0%), care with probes (10.0%) drains (5.0%) and handling of equipment (1.0%). Occurrences related to substructure were not found. Regarding the impact of occurrences on the patient's severity and on the nursing workload, no statistically significant difference was found in the mean between the SAPS II and TISS-28 scores of victim and nonvictim patients of occurrences, during admission to the ICU. When comparing severity and nursing workload in victim patients, before and after the event, a difference was observed only in the mean scores of the TISS-28 (P < 0.001). Regarding this analysis with the different types of occurrences, a statistically significant difference was found both in the SAPS II (P < 0.042) and TISS-28 (P < 0.001) scores in the occurrences regarding handling of the orotracheal cannula. The results of this investigation reinforce the need for investments to help qualify professionals to work with the critical patients as a major measurement for safety nursing assistance and quality in the ICU. The most common stage of medication error was reported in one study to be the prescribing stage, which accounted for 56% of errors detected [1] . Electronic prescribing (EP) with decision support has been shown to reduce the medication error rate [2] , but no studies could be found in critical care. This study compares the impact of this change on the medication error rate before and after the implementation of the GE Systems QS 5.6 clinical information system (CIS), which does not have decision support.",

About 5-35% of patients with sepsis develop ARDS and the condition is characterised by infiltration and accumulation of activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) within the capillary and alveolar spaces. Increased alveolar neutrophil elastase and decreased antiprotease activity also occurs. Elastase directly damages surfactant-specific protein in vitro and alters surfactant function. Recombinant surfactant protein C (r-SPC) improves pulmonary dynamics, oxygenation and reduces hyaline membrane formation in animal models of ALI/ARDS.

This study was performed to determine whether the lipoxygenase inhibitor phenidone and derivatives decrease the expression of adhesion molecules on stimulated endothelial cells and attenuate leucocyte-endothelial interactions under flow in vitro. Methods TNF-\u03b1-stimulated human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were incubated with phenidone, 4-methylphenidone, 4-4-dimethyl-phenidone, 5-methyl-phenidone, 5-phenylphenidone, and indometacin. We tested the inhibition of adhesion molecule expression (intracellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1], vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 [VCAM-1], E-selectin) on TNF-\u03b1-stimulated HUVEC after preincubation, coincubation and postincubation of the derivatives. The inhibition of endothelial cell expression was measured by flow cytometry and northern blot analysis. Adhesion of isolated leucocytes to pretreated endothelium was examined in a parallel plate flow chamber at a shear stress of 1.5 dynes/cm 2 .Results All cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors downregulated E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner after preincubation. Coincubation and postincubation did not decrease adhesion molecule expression. 4-4-Dimethyl-phenidone was the most effective compound (IC 50 273 \u00b5M), compared with the other tested cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors. Lipoxygenase inhibitors decreased E-selectin expression in northern blot analysis, whereas E-selectin expression was increased after indometacin incubation. Similarly, leucocyte adhesion was attenuated under flow conditions. We conclude that lipoxygenase inhibitors are able to decrease systemic inflammatory endothelial cell response.Conclusion Lipoxygenase Inhibitors are of therapeutical interest for the treatment of overwhelming systemic inflammation during shock, trauma, and sepsis.",

This period was characterized by a change in patient case-mix, high use of steroids, change in the pattern of antibiotic prescribing, upgrading of infection control precautions, and wearing gloves all the time. These changes were associated with an increase in the isolation of MRSA, Candida and Stenotrophomonas species. On the other hand, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella species, which used to be endemic, had disappeared. The MRSA ICU acquisition rate was significantly increased during SARS (25.3% vs 5.0% in 2000, 3.8% in 2001, 2.9% in 2002, P < 0.001).

Serum albumin is lower in patients with HELLP syndrome and correlates well with the development of MOF and mortality so it can be used as a useful predictor of both morbidity and mortality in critically ill pre-ecalmptic patients.Of the various complications of pregnancy, pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia syndrome (PE-EC) represent the most prevalent and potentially the most serious events. The adverse effects on the cardiovascular system in PE-EC syndrome comprise hypertension-induced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV diastolic dysfunction, LV failure, cerebral oedema, renal involvement and cardiac arrest.ConclusionDespite the relatively few cases of underlying HD in the PE-EC obstetric patients referred, the insignificantly lesser prevalence of depressed LV systolic function despite the higher BP, yet the greater incidence of mortality compared with the noneclamptic syndrome clearly point to the malignant nature of the PE-EC syndrome and raise the issue of early diagnosis and need for early intervention. The cardiovascular involvement in PE-EC syndrome is apparently related to hypertension-induced target organ damage and at best would represent a marker, pointing to the seriousness of pre-eclampsia syndrome in terms of mortality and adverse cardiac events.",

Despite this, its use has not been widely instituted, in part due to its cost.Methods A decision analytic Markov process was designed to model anemia management strategies for patients admitted to the ICU for > 48 hours. The model compared two strategies: standard care versus standard care plus administration of rhEPO, 40,000 U weekly. Probabilities, costs and outcomes were derived from longitudinal studies of ICU patients, current Canadian medical costs and a randomized trial of rhEPO versus placebo for ICU patients. The model measured ICU costs arising from administration of PRBC and rhEPO, long-term costs of infection and effectiveness in reducing infection. The base-case data included: rhEPO cost $439/40,000 U, PRBC cost $616/U, median ICU length of stay 4 days, overall probability of PRBC transfusion 0.6 per patient per admission and mean number PRBCs transfused 3 U per patient.

This study investigates the effects of fluid resuscitation with HES or isotonic saline solution (NaCl) on intestinal microvascular perfusion in a rat model of normotensive endotoxemia.MethodsIn anaesthetized rats (n = 7 per group), normotensive sepsis was induced by a continuous infusion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1.5 mg/kg/hour). After 1 hour of LPS infusion, HES 130/0.4 (16 ml/kg) or NaCl (66 ml/kg) were infused for a 1 hour period. Using intravital microscopy, the functional capillary density and erythrocyte velocity were measured in the mucosa of the terminal ileum at baseline, after 1 hour of endotoxemia and 3 hours after fluid resuscitation. Intestinal injury was assessed histologically. In another set of experiments the leukocyte-endothelium interaction was determined in mesenteric venules 3 hours after fluid resuscitation.",

We have recently reported that the administration of 200/0.5 hydroxyethyl starch (HES) stabilised the plasma volume (PV) in a porcine septic shock/CLS model, suggesting the intravascular persistence of artificial colloids despite CLS[2]. In the present study we compared the effects of 6% HES 130/0.4 and 6% HES 200/0.5 on PV and CLS in porcine septic shock. The infusion rate was titrated to maintain a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg. PV was determined using chromium-51-tagged erythrocytes and standard formulae. The albumin escape rate (AER) was calculated using iodine 125-labelled albumin. The cumulative fluid balance (CFB), systemic haemodynamics and oxygenation were measured until 6 hours after induction of sepsis.

In these cases a large hemotransfusion is needed and the usual sequence with postoperative multiorganic failure affecting patient outcome.Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven \u00ae , Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was used in 15 patients undergoing open heart surgery or surgery for aorta and aortic arch aneurysms. All patients had normal coagulation parameters before surgery. In these patients massive bleeding (10-20 ml/min) have developed during intraoperative or early postoperative periods, but bloodloss rate have minimal reduction, despite infusions of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate plasma, platelet concentrate, Trasilol and e-aminocapronic acid.After one-time recombinant FVIIa NovoSeven administration (the dose of rFVIIa ranged between 60 and 90 mg/kg body weight), bleeding disappeared in 14 patients. In one patient the bloodloss rate had been decreased from 20 to 5.5 ml/min and then repeated NovoSeven administration (90 mg/kg body weight) stopped the bleeding and simultaneously stabilized some hemocoagulating parameters.rFVIIa (NovoSeven \u00ae ) may be used to effective treatment massive bleeding and to reduce the amount of transfused blood components in patients undergoing long-time surgery with extracorporeal circulation.P138 Burn variables and intensive care mortality in severe burn patientsIntroduction The evaluation of probability of death from burn injuries would provide clinicians with an explicit basis for clinical decisions, help them understand the relative contributions of specific prognostic criteria and reduce reliance on clinical intuition[1]. The goal of this study is to estimate the mortality rate and the clinical variables for early assessment of outcome of a severe burn population.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with severe burn injuries admitted to a polyvalent intensive care unit (ICU) of a university teaching hospital from 1999 to 2001. Information collected included age, sex, percentage of body surface area (%TBSA) burned, SAPS II score and SOFA score on admission, Baux score (age + %TBSA), presence or absence of inhalation injury, need for intubation, time of first escharotomy, length of ICU stay (LOS), and ICU mortality. Data were analysed using SPSS for Windows. 31 \u00b1 13.5, P < 0.05). All patients were intubated and ventilated. All dead patients and six survivors (66.6%) sustained inhalation injuries. The first escharotomy was performed 17.2 \u00b1 7.4 days from the injury date in the patients who died and 8.2 \u00b1 3.1 days in the others. Moreover, the mean of LOS was increased for those who died (34.4 \u00b1 36.8 vs 19.5 \u00b1 17.6, P < 0.05).",

We evaluate the pretransplantation Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS) therapy in reducing the relevant risk factors relating to this early mortality.ResultsEighty treatments were performed safely. All patients showed a positive response: the SOFA score, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), mean arterial pressure (MAP), TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 were improved significantly(Table 1). Eight patients recovered and avoided OLT, eight patients died, 34 patients were successfully bridged to OLT: the OLT outcome within 30 days was 28 kept alive and six patients died.

Positive effects on systemic hemodynamics in patients with septic shock were noticed because of proinflammatory mediator elimination.ResultsWe studied retrospectively two groups: A (n = 13) and B (n = 5). At the initial stage, the mean arterial pressure was equal in both groups. At the end of the third day of treatment, we managed to discontinue inotropic support in 60% of Group A patients, whereas in Group B patients the dose of dopamine exceeded 25 \u00b5g/kg/min. The cardiac rate of Group B patients increased, accordingly. We noticed satisfied cardiac indexes (CI) in Group A: dyns/cm 5 /m 2 at the end of the third day of treatment. The pulmonary vascular resistance index in Group A patients was on a subnormal level (218.1-259.9 dyns/cm 5 /m 2 ), and in Group B increased to 621.2 \u00b1 222.0 dyns/cm 5 /m 2 (P < 0.001). The same tendency we observed for the pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure. All patients had cardiac failure that was compensated in full for the patients Group A, and proliferated in Group B patients.Conclusion Early application of CHDF in patients with septic shock leads to significant improvement of systemic hemodynamics that was important for the treatment results.",

Data was compiled from advanced life-support ambulance services from five distinct, suburban-rural cities all utilizing identical RSI protocols with training conducted by a single individual. RSI was indicated for Glasgow Coma Scores < 8, rapidly declining respiratory and/or hemodynamic status, or persistent hypoxia or unresponsiveness in the presence of assisted ventilation and oxygen therapy. Etomidate and succinylcholine were the agents utilized for sedation and paralysis, respectively. Laryngoscopy was limited to 30 s with no more than three intubation attempts permitted. Medical records from the initial receiving hospital were reviewed for patients meeting prehospital RSI criteria.Results Eighty-seven patients underwent prehospital RSI for medical emergencies. Outcome data is available for 71/87 (82%). Neurologic (30 patients), respiratory (21 patients) and drug overdoses (15 patients) comprised the most common indications for RSI. Twenty-seven out of 71 (38%) died as a result of their underlying medical conditions, which included 14/30 neurologic, 10/21 respiratory and 0/15 drug overdose patients. Six patients, all with respiratory distress, experienced cardiac arrests immediately following RSI, none of whom were resuscitated. Patients surviving their neurologic event required prolonged rehabilitation. No patient demonstrated evidence for aspiration pneumonia related to RSI. In the same time period, outcome data is available for 58 patients meeting RSI criteria but not receiving the intervention. Fifteen out of 58 (28%) died as a result of their underlying conditions and not airway management interventions.Conclusion RSI does not appear to significantly improve patient outcomes when utilized for medical emergencies.

Frequent ED patients were identified as having more than four ED visits in this period. Age, sex, investigation performed, presenting complaints and disposal were analysed.ResultsThe A&E Department at our hospital sees approximately 70,000 patients/year. The period the study was obtained, 29,732 new patients visited the department. Seventy-one patients presented 386 times, accounting for 1.3% of the department's workload. Sixty-five per cent of visits were for existing or recurrent medical problems. This group of patients had a 14.5% admission rate to the hospital compared with 9.3% for the general ED population during the study period. This group of patients usually can have access to other medical sources of primary care, but they use ED for complaints they believe need immediate attention. A significant number of this group were admitted to the hospital. The department's workload and the cost, for investigations performed and inhospital admissions, are discussed.P288 Pivotal role of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in pediatric drowning incidentsJ Wigginton 1 , P Pepe 1 , A Idris 1 , D Persse 2 , R Berg 3 1 University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Parkland Hospital, Dallas, Texas, USA; 2 Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA; 3 University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA Critical Care 2004, 8(Suppl 1):P288 (DOI 10.1186/cc2755)BackgroundThe earliest possible provision of basic and advanced life support techniques are traditionally emphasized for resuscitation in drowning incidents.

In the past the ACRO group focused its efforts on early defibrillation: most of the personnel has been trained in basic life support and advanced cardiac life support and defibrillators have been placed at each floor of the hospitals. But about 2/3 of IHCA cases are sustained by asystole (A) and pulseless electrical activity (PEA), conditions with a low percentage of positive cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Most of these IHCA do not occur unexpectedly: 80% of patients have documented clinical deterioration (increase of respiratory rate, lowered blood pressure, altered level of consciousness) in the 6-12 hours preceeding IHCA. On the basis of these data, the ACRO group has recently planned a project to prevent IHCA by early detection and treatment of clinical deterioration. The project is based on a periodic assessment of all the in-ward patients at risk by the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a simple clinical score based on six parameters (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, level of consciousness, diuresis, temperature). Ward patients at risk are those admitted with an acute abdomen, pancreatitis, trauma, patients with coexisting medical conditions, those undergoing major surgery, patients following ICU discharge and patients causing a concern to nursing and medical staff. High values of MEWS (> 3) or a sudden increase of the score will trigger a closer patient assessment, the need to recheck MEWS on the next observation and/or the alert of the internal emergency medical team; the patient will be admitted to the ICU or highdependency unit, if necessary. To evaluate the feasibility of the project, in particular to assess the impact on nursing workload and to quantify the number of patients with deteriorating clincal conditions, we performed a survey in the two main hospitals of our area. On two different working days(18 June 2002and 3 February 2003) we assessed the MEWS in all the in-ward patients. During the survey were evaluated 850 patients, 413 the first day and 437 the second day, with a mean time of examination of 5 min 40 s. Present results indicate that MEWS assessement is simple and does not interfere excessively on nursing workload, so it could be routinely used on a large number of patients. The high percentage of patients with signs of possible clinical deterioration (values of MEWS > 3; about 17%) seems to justify our project; further confirmation will be provided by the results of the follow-up of these patients, which is ongoing.

He was initially treated by an ambulance team with basic life support measures, including the delivery of thre shocks. When the patient arrived at hospital, VF was prolonged. We provided advanced cardiac life support measures, and administered NIF according to our protocol and did more shocks, resulting in stabilization of VF. An angiography after return of spontaneous circulation showed an inferior acute myocardial infarction. The patient could be discharge with full recovery (cerebral performance category 1 [good cerebral performance]). Nifekalant is a possibly effective antiarrhythmic agent for patients suffering from cardiac arrest with shock-resistant VF.P293 Comparison of automatic vs semiautomatic automated external defibrillators used by laypersons S Beckers, M Fries, J Bickenbach, M Derwall, R Kuhlen, R Rossaint University Hospital, Aachen, Germany Critical Care 2004, 8(Suppl 1):P293 (DOI 10.1186/cc2760)Background The survival rate in cases of cardiac arrest depends mainly on the availability of and the time to defibrillation. It is widely accepted that the use of automated external defibrillators (AED) by trained medical or nonmedical personnel improves survival rates. So far there have been no definitive recommendations about the content and duration of teaching programs.Methods and resultsAs laypersons, all 236 first-year medical students in their first weeks of medical formation were chosen to demonstrate the use of semiautomatic and automatic AED in mock cardiac arrest scenarios without any instructions. The students were evaluated once, followed by a second test 1 week later after attending specified instructions. Comparing time to shock between semiautomatic and automatic AED, the subjects were significantly faster during both evaluations using the semiautomatic device (77.5 \u00b1 20.5 vs 85.2 \u00b1 17 s; P \u2264 0.01 and 55 \u00b1 10.3 vs 59.6 \u00b1 9.6 s; P \u2264 0.01). A total of 92.4% subjects with the semiautomatic and 95.8% with the automatic demonstrated a safe usage.Conclusions Untrained laypersons are able to use semiautomatic as well as automatic AED fast, safely and sufficiently. After one use and nonspecific instructions to the used device, improvements of their practical performance is significant. These findings encourage simplifying technology for AED in future and it reinforces that design, construction and visual aids have an effect on the performance of the users. Further development of simple devices with clear and obvious visual and audible instructions has to be done.P294 Use of automated external defibrillators in a majorLatin America airline: 5 years' experience S Timerman, P Magalhaes Alves, M Castro Gonzalez, A Mansur, JAF Ramires Heart Institute (InCor), Sao Paulo, Brazil; VARIG, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Critical Care 2004, 8(Suppl 1):P294 (DOI 10.1186/cc2761)Background Passengers who have ventricular fibrillation, the most common mechanism, aboard commercial aircraft rarely survive, and can be treated effectively only with prompt defibrillation. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of making automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) available for use on a major Latin Ameica airline for passengers with cardiac arrest.MethodsIn 1998, Varig Brazilian Airlines began the onboard defibrillation program with AEDs. Flight attendants were trained in the use of the defibrillator and applied the device when passengers had a lack of consciousness, pulse, or respiration. A portable monitor (Biolog 3000; Micromedical) was added and an electrocardiogram that was obtained during each use of the device.

The need for a large thoracotomy and the technical difficulties implied in its accomplishment have contributed to this technique not being used. The current study is an evaluation of a new device for minimally invasive direct cardiac massage -before cardiac surgery when ventricular fibrillation was induced in humans. After induction of the ventricular fibrillation there was a 1-min period of cardiac massage with the device. The device was positioned in the left hemithorax and the cardiac massage was begun at the frequency of 100/min. Analyzed in 10 patients were: cardiac output, myocardial blood flow, and aorta, right atrium, and coronary perfusion pressures. The aorta diastolic and coronary perfusion pressures generated by the device were very high; an increase of 27.15 \u00b1 4.55 mmHg in the coronary perfusion pressure from the moment of the 1-min cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).In conclusion, the device increased haemodynamic parameters in 1-min CPR, before cardiac surgery.P296 Witnessed cardiopulmonary resuscitation: the public's perceptionObjective To develop an understanding of the public's attitude concerning witnessed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).",

If deficiencies were detected during the exercise, efforts were made to correct them via departmental meetings concerning CPR procedures and implementation, carrying out specific actions to correct deficiencies, and by inviting the medical and nursing staff to refresher courses in CPR (advanced cardiac life support [ACLS] or basic cardiac life support [BLS]). A total of 1239 medical staff members participated in CPR training from 1999 to 2003, according to the following distribution: BLS, 924; ACLS, 107; pediatric BLS, 136; pediatric advanced cardiac life support, 72. Personnel participating included: nurses, 64% (790); staff physicians, 31% (385); part-time house physicians, 5% (61). and discussion We believe that surprise resuscitation drills are the key to improved functioning during actual emergency resuscitation, both on a departmental level and a general hospital level. The benefit of surprise CPR drills lies in the examination of the knowledge level, skills, and the ability to implement them. The department's readiness with equipment and instruments is examined, together with their implementation of CPR protocol. It should be emphasized that this exercise is efficient only after the hospital personnel have undergone basic CPR.

Aim To determine whether inhospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) of cancer patients is worthwhile. Methods Data of all inhospital cardiac/respiratory arrests from December 2002 to September 2003, in a 550-bed tertiary cancer care center, were prospectively recorded using the Utstein template. A panel of three expert oncologists independently reviewed the medical records of these patients and grouped them according to their disease status by a majority view as follows: group I, patients whose disease status was being assessed; group II, patients who received treatment to achieve cure or disease control; group III, no treatment options offered except palliative care. These data were retrospectively analysed with respect to the following outcomes: return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), survival on hospital discharge (SOHD), cerebral performance criteria (CPC) (scale 1-5: 1, good and 5, coma) and survival after arrest (recorded on 1 December 2003). 39%) patients had sustained ROSC. Twenty-four (28%) of these patients had SOHD (three [3.52%] in group I, 21 [24.7%] in group II, 0 in group III; P < 0.001). Twentyone (24.7%) patients, two (2.4%) patients and one (1.2%) patient had good, moderate and poor CPC, respectively. On 1 December 2003, eight patients (9.4%) (one [1.2%] in group I and seven [8.2%] in group II) were alive. The mean survival after discharge was 23.4 \u00b1 68.4 (0-356) in those who died and 206.8 \u00b1 101.2 (82-351) in survivors. Nineteen patients (22.4%) had a 1-month survival, eight patients (9.4%) had a 6-month survival. None of the patients labeled by even one expert as group III had SOHD. Conclusion Resuscitation of cancer patients is worthwhile. However, outcome in advanced cases (group III) is poor.

Setting A retrospective audit in a district general hospital over a 6-month period (from 1 August 2002 to 31 January 2003). Data were obtained from the ITU Acu-base, the Resuscitation Officer Data-Base and patients' medical records. Measurements and results Two hundred and fifty-three cardiac arrest calls were made. One hundred and ninety-eight cardiac arrests were identified and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed. CPR was successful in 51 of the 198 patients (25.8%). A total of 52.9% (26 patients) were admitted to the ITU, with an average waiting time of 4.8 hours. A DNAR order was ruled out in 11 cases (21.5%) and the remaining 15 patients were transferred to the medical ward, the coronary care unit or the highdependency unit. The length of CA was less than 10 min in 17 of the 26 patients admitted to the ITU. The mortality rate for these patients was 41.2% (seven patients). None of the nine patients (average age 74 years) whose length of CA exceed 10 min survived. Their length of stay in ITU ranged from 2 hours to 5 days. ITU outcome was 61.5% (16 patients)and hospital outcome was 19.2% (five patients). Factors associated with a poor prognosis include patients older than 70 years old who have suffered prolonged cardiac arrest.

In Western Macedonia the main reason for transferring trauma patients is SBI, to a neurosurgeon with a travel time as long as 3 hours. Five general hospitals serve the health service needs of a population of 301,522 inhabitants. Bodosakeio General Hospital covers a real population of 100,000 and is the only one in the region backed by an intensive care unit and 24-hour facilities for computerised tomography scanning.Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence, distribution, clinical patterns and early outcome of SBI patients admitted to our non-neurosurgical hospital, as a basis for future efforts at improvements.MethodsCases of SBI patients admitted to Bodosakeio hospital (Glasgow Coma Scale \u2264 8) were identified retrospectively for a 23-month period (January 2002-December 2003) using data from the District Health System of West Macedonia, the accident and emergency unit, the hospital forms registering interhospital transports and the intensive care unit records. Extracted data concerned the incidence, gender distribution, age, external causes, C-T lesions, associated injuries, early transfer and mortality at the end of acute hospitalization. Additionally, data for the SBI distribution throughout the five general hospitals in the region were analyzed.ResultsDuring the study period 1127 traumatic brain injury cases were registered, comprising 11.22% of the Bodosakeio Hospital Surgical Emergency Department workload.

Positive effects of AA in the postoperative period are well known (e.g. radical scavenger activity); hence there is an indication for the substitution of AA. However, the dosage commonly recommended for substitution during clinical nutrition is not adequate. Therefore, a postoperative AA substitution procedure 'overnight' to normal values in plasma was investigated in this randomized, prospective study on a postoperative ICU in a university hospital.Fifty-seven electively operated patients were assigned to a control group or an intervention group. In all patients the AA plasma concentration was analysed preoperatively and on the first three postoperative days.

However, the postoperative plasma concentration was lowered (< 45.5 \u00b5mol/l) in 82.4% of all patients.In the intervention group, the dosage regime increased the AA plasma concentration to > 45.5 \u00b5mol/l in 89.6% overnight.In conclusion, the investigated substitution procedure is sufficient to increase the AA plasma concentration overnight to high normal values in postoperative ICU patients.

Copper as a substantial element in the normal function of oxidative enzyme systems (so-called 'cuproenzymes') and in plasma primarily bound to ceruloplasmine, an acute phase protein, is difficult to interpret in critically ill patients. However, levels at the start were normal (14.5 \u00b1 6.3 \u00b5mol/l, n = 10.0-30.0 \u00b5mol/l) and could be raised significantly (17.4 \u00b1 4.6 \u00b5mol/l, P = 0.004). Ceruloplasmin levels were within the normal range and did not change significantly over the study period (0.34 \u00b1 0.11 g/l, n = 0.24-0.62 to 0.37 \u00b1 0.10 g/l, P = 0.414). Manganese is part of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase and important for the metabolic effects of vitamin K. In our population normal starting levels were found (30.5 \u00b1 13.7 nmol/l, n = 2-37 nmol/l) and were raised significantly (37.0 \u00b1 16.3 nmol/l, P = 0.021). Selenium as a co-factor in the erythrocyte glutathion peroxidase complex has a protective role against peroxides. (Very) low baseline levels were found (0.53 \u00b1 0.22 \u00b5mol/l, n = 0.8-1.8 \u00b5mol/l) and the supplement, although double the DRD, could not normalize this (0.71 \u00b1 0.28 \u00b5mol/l), but the improvement was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Albumin as the transport protein for selenium was low and did not change significantly (20.9 \u00b1 6.0 g/l, n = 35-50 to 21.1 \u00b1 6.5 g/l, P = 0.959). Zinc metabolism and physiology are subject to debate. Zinc deficiency, however, is known for impaired wound healing, alopecia and immunologic dysfunctions. Almost all patients were deficient at the start (8.6 \u00b1 3.6 \u00b5mol/l, n = 11.5-23.5 \u00b5mol/l), and then supplementation did result in significant improvement, but only just to normal levels (11.4 \u00b1 2.6 \u00b5mol/l, P < 0.0001). Chromium is a cofactor in insulin metabolism and glucose utilisation. Plasma levels are difficult to assess, because of their biologic significance. However, starting levels were high (86 \u00b1 52 nmol/l, n = 9.6-50 nmol/l) and were raised nonsignificantly (90 \u00b1 45 nmol/l). The chromiumtransporting protein transferrin was low and did not change significantly (1.3 \u00b1 0.9 g/l, n = 2.0-3.5 to 1.3 \u00b1 0.4 g/l, P = 0.475).The study was aimed at investigating plasmatic levels of zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se) in critical care patients, and the influence of standard supplementation of those elements on such levels.",

In these cases, the ICP was controlled with antipyretic therapy and pentobarbital infusion. In each of these cases, a computerised tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed bilateral thalamic hemorrhage and slight edema on the day of admission. In the other patient, the ICP suddenly increased to more than 50 mmHg, and a vasoconstrictor infusion (noradrenaline 0.5 \u00b5g/kg/min) was needed to maintain the CPP on the second hospital day. The brain CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated severe cortical brain edema, similar to that described in the hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome (HSES) in Europe. All the patients survived; two made remarkable recoveries, including the patient who needed the vasoconstrictor infusion.Conclusions Before instituting ICP monitoring, it was difficult to determine the most appropriate therapy for severe IAE and survivors usually had significant neurological sequelae. (1) The control of CPP in patients with IAE is just as important as it is in the management of patients with severe head injuries. (2) Based on the ICP, the CT and MRI scans, IAE could be divided into two groups. (3) One type of IAE seen in Japan may be related to the HSES described in Europe. Background Severe head trauma patients are often deeply sedated and this can cause a myocardial depression with hypotension and low cardiac output. Hypotension is very dangerous, particularly in patients with cerebral oedema and high intracranial pressure. Dobutamine and/or norepinephrine are usually given to restore myocardial performance and increase blood pressure and, consequently, cerebral perfusion pressure (PPC). The effects of these two drugs on the cerebral blood flow (CBF) are unknown. The aim of this study is to measure CBF and central hemodynamics in a group of patients with severe head trauma (Glasgow Coma Scale < 8), first using dobutamine and then norepinephrine.Methods Five patients have been studied. The following parameters were monitored: intracranial pressure, jugular oxygen saturation (SjO 2 ), mean arterial pressure, central hemodynamic parameters (cardiac index, central venous pressure, systemic vascular resistances, intrathoracic blood volume, extravascular lung water) and CBF. The CBF was measured with the TCDI technique (COLD-system; Germany) [1] . Patients had two fiberoptic catheters provided with a thermistor: the first inserted in the femoral artery and the second in the bulb of the right jugular vein.First patients had a dobutamine infusion (t1) to reach PPC > 70 mmHg (mean dosage 6.7 \u00b5g/kg/min), and then, after central hemodynamic and CBF measurements, dobutamine was changed with norepinephrine (0.12 \u00b5g/kg/min) (t2), trying to reach the same PPC achieved with dobutamine. Finally, measurements were performed with simultaneous infusion of dobutamine and norepinephrine (dobutamine 4.2 \u00b5g/kg/min and norepinephrine 0.05 \u00b5g/kg/min) (t3), always achieving the same PPC as t1.",

No significantly changes were observed in central hemodynamic parameters.Conclusions From these preliminary data it seems that dobutamine causes a decrease of CBF compared with norepinephrine, with no changes in central hemodynamic parameters and PPC. The physiopathology of these results remains unknown. Introduction In Poland, in 2002, the number of organ donors per one million inhabitants was 12.68, and was 8.9% higher than in 2001 (11.64/million). But still many potential organ donors are missed. The objective of this study was to identify the major causes of missed donors in a university hospital (600 beds) with a busy neurosurgery ward.",

The involvement of this hospitals in an organ donation program is the major task for the coming years. Reis-Miranda, one nurse can handle 46 TISS-28 points and a TISS-28 < 20 has been suggested to qualify as medium care. In order to rationalize the use of intensive care resources in our 56-bed surgical ICU, which has a 1:2 nurse to patient ratio, we developed a tool for determining the required number of medium care beds. Comparison with a 11-bed MCU, which has a 1:3 ratio, was made.",

In the ICU the median (P25-P75) TISS was 34 (28-40), vs 27 (22-32) in the MCU (P < 0.0001). In the ICU, but not in the MCU, the median TISS was significantly higher during week days than during weekends (35 [29-41] vs 32 [28-38], respectively; P < 0.0001). Taking actual nurse staffing into account, ICU nurses on average handled 70 TISS points and MCU nurses 81 TISS points. In the ICU, 11% of patient-days were considered medium care by both physicians and nurses, which translated into up to five medium care beds within 56 ICU beds. Patient-day-labeled medium care scored 26 (23-29) for TISS, as compared with 35 (30-41) for intensive care (P < 0.0001). A receiver-operator characteristic curve revealed an area under the curve of 84.3% and identified a TISS of 29 as the best cutoff for medium care. Using this definition, 25% of all ICU and 57% of all MCU patient-days would be labeled medium care. However, this cutoff yields 19% false-positives. Using a cutoff of 20 TISS points, only 3% of ICU patient-days and 15% of MCU patient-days would qualify.",

The P-related variables include evidence of immunosuppression, dialysis-dependent renal failure, nursing home residence, and performance status. The I-related variables include site of infection and place of acquisition. The Rrelated variables include heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature. Sequential Organ failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated to quantify organ dysfunction. We used Student's t test, the Mann-Whitney U test, the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test for comparison between bacteremia and nonbacteremia groups. To define which variables were significantly and independently associated with bacteremia, we performed logistic regression analysis including day 1 SOFA score, temperature > 38\u00b0C, heart rate, immunocompromised status and site of infection (urinary 1, other 0).
