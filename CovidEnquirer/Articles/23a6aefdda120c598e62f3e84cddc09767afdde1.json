The genetic material in viruses can be either RNA or DN A. Viruses need a host cell for their replication and depend on the cellular machinery of the host for replication and to cause a disease. Important viruses and viral diseases include arbovirus and renavirus, bunya viruses, cytomegalovirus, papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr virus, genital herpes, German measles (rubella), hanta viruses, hemorrhagic viruses, herpes simplex, human immunodeficiency disease, influenza A, Kaposi's sarcoma, measles (rubeola), poliomyelitis, poxvirus Infections, rabies, respiratory syncytial virus infection, Varicella-Zoster viral disease, viral encephalitis, viral hepatitis, and West Nile virus.",

The genetic material may be either single stranded (poliovirus or human immunodeficiency virus) or double-stranded (herpes simplex virus or hepatitis B virus). The majority of RNA viruses carry single stranded genome. Exceptions to this include influenza A, bunya viruses, rotavirus, arena virus, and other reoviruses. Most DNA viruses carry a double stranded genome, with an exception being parvoviridae Kok and Pechere (1999) . Other classifications for viruses are based on the polarity of the genomes, type of nucleocapsid, or shape of the viral particle.",

Moreover, viruses such as human immunodeficiency and hepatitis C virus are latent in host for months to years. In general, after entering the host, viruses locate their target cell through recognition of the host cell surface receptors complementing the viral cell surface proteins. After fusion of the viral particle with the host cell membrane, and subsequent release of the viral contents into the cell, new viral particles are produced by the host cell machinery utilizing the viral-specific proteins/nucleic acids. Following assembly and packaging with viral capsid and envelope, the mature viral particles infect other host cells. These particles are able to evade the host immune system, and to develop resistance to antiviral medications through mutations that occur during the replication process.",
