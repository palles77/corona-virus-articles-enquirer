            "text": "Feline calicivirus (FCV) is an important veterinary pathogen and causes respiratory disease in cats. Because it grows well in cell culture, FCV is often used as a model virus of non-culturable caliciviruses. In this study, a cell-free and two cell culture-based biosensor assay systems were established to detect FCV protease activity. The assays utilize luciferase sensor technology or second-generation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET 2 ). A luciferase sensor was designed to contain an FCV protease cleavage motif within the permutated luciferase (GloSensor). The BRET 2 -based probe contained the same cleavage motif flanked by a renilla luciferase and a variant of green fluorescent protein. To confirm the specificity of these assay systems, GloSensor or a BRET 2 -based probe containing a mutation in the cleavage motif was also constructed. In a cell-free assay, GloSensor showed increased luminescence in proportion to the amount of FCV protease, while no signal change was observed when the construct harboring the mutant cleavage motif was used. A feline cell line stably expressing GloSensor or the BRET 2 -based probe was established. Increased levels of GloSensor luminescence, and decreased levels of BRET 2 signals were observed according to input FCV titers. In contrast, no significant signal change was observed in the cells stably expressing the mutant cleavage motif. GloSensor and the BRET 2 -based probe were capable of detecting the inhibitory activity of ribavirin in FCV-infected cells. Our results demonstrate that these biosensors are useful to detect FCV protease activity induced in infected cells, and well worth consideration for screening of anti-FCV protease compounds in cell-free system as well as anti-FCV compounds in cultured cells.",

Prevalence of FCV was 29.4% in clinically diseased cats (Abd-Eldaim et al., 2009) , and 43.1% in cat population of a rescue shelter (Zicola et al., 2009) . At present, vaccination is administered worldwide to prevent FCV infection in pet cats. However, new highly virulent FCV strains that cause systemic hemorrhagic disease and significant mortality up to 67% have recently been reported (Foley et al., 2006) . Current vaccines may not protect against these new strains, highlighting the importance of antivirals (Radford et al., 2007) . Sensitive methods for detecting FCV infection would be extremely useful to identify such inhibitors.",

The viral protease, encoded in ORF1, is initially synthesized as a part of the ORF1 polyprotein, and responsible for the cleavage among ORF1 proteins to generate functional non-structural proteins. This protease also functions to cleave an ORF2-encoded protein to generate the capsid protein VP1 (Clarke and Lambden, 2000; Sosnovtsev et al., 1998 Sosnovtsev et al., , 2002 . The FCV protease cleaves peptide bonds downstream of a specific glutamic acid (E) in the precursor protein (Green, 2007; Oka et al., 2009; Sosnovtsev et al., 1998 Sosnovtsev et al., , 2002 . This processing is essential for the formation of mature infectious virus particles (Sosnovtsev et al., 1998 (Sosnovtsev et al., , 2002 .

BRET 2 uses a luciferase (RLuc) isolated from the sea pansy Renilla reniformis as the donor, and a GFP variant (GFP 2 ) as the acceptor (Fig. 4a ). The energy transfer efficiencies between RLuc and GFP 2 , upon DeepBlueC addition, were determined ratiometrically by dividing the intensity of the acceptor emission by that of the donor emission. This ratiometric measurement is referred to as the BRET 2 signal and reflects the proximity of RLuc to GFP 2 A BRET 2 signal is generated due to the proximity of the GFP 2 and RLuc molecules (left), but it declines significantly when they are separated by FCV protease (right). (b) Schematic diagram of the FCV protease substrate. The 12 amino acid sequences of the FCV protease cleavage motifs between GFP 2 and RLuc are shown. The cleavage site is indicated by a slash, and the mutated amino acid is underlined. (Pfleger and Eidne, 2006) . The FCV protease recognition sequence, PLFRLE/ADDGSI, was inserted between the donor and acceptor of a BRET 2 pair (Fig. 4b) . As a negative control, a construct containing a mutant cleavage motif (PLFRLA/ADDGSI) that cannot be cleaved by the FCV protease was also generated (Fig. 4b) . When the FCV protease cleaves the recognition sequence, the GFP 2 and RLuc proteins drift away from each other, and the energy transfer to GFP 2 is lost (Fig. 4a) . CRFK cells expressing BRET 2 -FCV-Cut and BRET 2 -FCV-Uncut showed a BRET 2 ratio of approximately 1.0 without FCV infection, whereas CRFK cells expressing BRET 2 -FCV-Cut exhibited declining BRET 2 ratios (GFP 2 /RLuc) of 0.22, 0.48, and 0.82 when FCV infection was performed at MOIs of 1, 0.1, and 0.01, respectively (Fig. 5a) . In contrast, CRFK cells expressing the BRET 2 -FCV-Uncut showed no detectable BRET 2 signal change regardless of MOI (Fig. 5a) . The expression of BRET 2 -FCV-Cut and -Uncut proteins in the cells, and a cleaved GFP 2 product generated in BRET 2 -FCV-Cutexpressing cells were confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5b) . These results demonstrate that the BRET 2 -FCV-Cut-expressing CRFK cell line is useful for detecting the protease activity after FCV infection.",

In addition, the CellGlo system may be more useful than the BRET 2 system for high-throughput screening of FCV protease activity, because a medium change is not needed before the cells are harvested: the reagent is simply added to the well. The BRET 2 system requires a washing step before the signal is measured to eliminate serum and phenol-red, and the BRET 2 signal is measured with sequential dual luminescence measurements: one for the donor and one for the acceptor for each microplate well, because of the short lifetime of the light emission. Therefore, the donor and acceptor light output must be measured consecutively or simultaneously before moving to the next microplate well. Nevertheless, the BRET 2 system has merits. The BRET 2 signal is a ratiometric measurement value, which eliminates the data variability caused by fluctuations due to assay volume and the number of cells per well. We can also confirm the expression of this sensor protein by fluoromicroscopy by detecting GFP 2 (data not shown) and immunoblotting (Fig. 5b) .",

The N-domain of the GloSensor is colored dark-gray and the Cdomain of the GloSensor is colored light-gray. The polypeptide linker, a small black square, inhibits the formation of the closed conformation and yields low levels of luminescence (left). Cleavage by the FCV protease relieves this constraint, activating the GloSensor and resulting in high levels of luminescence (right). (b) Schematic diagram of the GloSensor. The 12 amino acid sequences of the FCV protease cleavage motif were located within the genetically modified firefly luciferase. The cleavage site is indicated by a slash, and the mutated amino acid is underlined.",

The medium was aspirated and replaced with medium containing ribavirin at a concentration of 50, 100, 200, or 400 M. After 20 h, the bioluminescent signals were measured.
