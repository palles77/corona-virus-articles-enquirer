            "text": "Conventionally-housed laboratory rodents commonly sustain infection with one or more viral agents (Foster et al., 1982) . Since some of these infections are known or thought to affect the outcome of experimental procedures, it is important to understand their pathogenesis and natural history. The execution of studies designed to elucidate the biology of rodent virus infections requires the ability to detect and quantify infectious virus in large numbers of clinical specimens. Because of the high transmission potential of many of these agents, alternatives to animal inoculation are desirable. Many rodent viruses do not induce morphologic changes in inoculated cell cultures, necessitating the use of immunochemical probes to detect viral antigens. We have used the fluorescent focus test for detection and quantification (Smith, 1983; Smith et al., 1984) ; however, the procedure is expensive and labor-intensive. It is particularly cumbersome when applied to large numbers of samples. Smith et al. (1981) reported quantification of herpes, mumps and measles viruses in unfixed cultured cells using the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) . Recently, Yong-He et al. (1984) reported the use of EIA to detect several flaviviruses in cultured cells which were formalin-fixed prior to processing. In the case of rodent viruses, viral inactivation prior to EIA is desirable to protect animals housed in the vicinity of the laboratory, as well as personnel in the case of zoonotic viruses.",

As shown in Table 2 , optimum virus titers determined by EIA are not reached until day 5. Thus, it was not surprising that EIA titers were, in some cases, about lo-fold lower than fluorescent focus titers.
