SFTS is characterized by sudden onset of hyperpyrexia, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, neurological symptoms and possibly even death within 7-14 days after the onset of the disease, with a reported fatality rate varying between 12% and 30% [1, 2] . To date, neither effective antiviral strategies nor conventional vaccines have achieved sustainable control of the spread of SFTSV. A better understanding of the mechanism underlying SFTS progression will be helpful in developing new preventive and therapeutic strategies.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that immune cells, such as monocytes, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the peripheral blood are also dramatically decreased in acute SFTS patients, especially in deceased patients [3, 4] . A previous study demonstrates that the lymphocyte cellularity of the red pulp is decreased in the spleens of SFTSVinfected mice during the first week after inoculation [5] . Additional reports show that CD4 T cells are decreased in the acute phase and in patients who eventually die from the disease [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, almost all previous studies collected samples at one or two times points during the disease process rather than determining the dynamic changes in the surviving and the deceased patients. No studies on the correlation between CD4 T cells and disease severity exist. Additionally, the role of CD4 T-cell subsets in SFTS progression remains unclear.",

            "text": "CD4 T cells are subdivided into multiple subsets, including T helper 1 (Th1), Th2, Th17, and T regulatory cells (Tregs), as defined by their characteristic cytokine production profiles [10] . Th1 cells are defined by their ability to secrete the cytokines interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and play critical roles in the immune responses to many viral infections [10] . Th2 cells are critical for promoting anti-helminthic immunity and allergic inflammation through the production of interleukin 4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13 [10] . Th17 cells are a more recently discovered population of T helper cells, implicated in driving harmful inflammation during autoimmunity. Th17 cells may contribute to immunologic injury during responses against viruses by producing the hallmark cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 [11, 12] . Tregs maintain immune homeostasis by limiting the magnitude of immune responses against pathogens and by controlling inflammatory reactions by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 [13] . When the total counts of CD4 T-cell subsets are decreased or their functions are lost, the ability of these cells to mediate viral removal, provide help for B cells, and regulate immunopathology will be damaged. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that considerable plasticity exists within CD4 T-cell subsets in vivo, especially during responses to pathogens [14, 15] . Previous studies have suggested that the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Tregs balances are critical for the maintenance of immune T cell homeostasis in a number of different autoimmune diseases and viral infections [16] [17] [18] . A deep understanding of the changes in Th1, Th2, Th17 and Tregs in SFTS patients is needed to develop effective antiviral strategies and immune regulation methods to eliminate the virus and protect the host from excessive inflammatory damage.",

Our data indicated that the decreased percentage and number of CD4 T cells, and decreased numbers of Th1, Th2 and Tregs were associated with an increased severity of SFTS. Additionally, increased percentages of Th2, Th17 and Tregs in residual CD4 T cells, as well as skewing of Th17/Treg and Th2/Th1 ratios may cause poor outcomes in SFTS patients. Moreover, the Th17/Treg ratio was positively correlated with the level of IL- Our data demonstrated that T lymphopenia-and CD4 T-cell depletion in particular-was commonly observed during the early course of SFTSV infection, especially in patients who die. This finding was consistent with the results of previous reports on SFTS viral infection [6, 8] . In addition, the percentage and number of CD4 T cells but not CD8 T cells were negatively correlated with the severity of SFTS. Previous studies have shown that the depletion of CD4 T cells (but not CD8 T cells) results in delayed pulmonary viral clearance, and CD4 T cells are required for the generation of optimal antibody responses following infection with coronavirus or vaccinia virus [25, 26] . Moreover, an absence of CD4 T cells has been shown to compromise the production of primary cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses following infection with vaccinia virus and HSV [27, 28] . Overall, the dramatic loss of CD4 T cells in the deceased patients may limit the initiation and maintenance of effective humoral and cytotoxic T-cell immunity, leading to immunosuppression.",

Th1 cells play a significant role in antibacterial and antiviral immune defence and in protective humoral responses [10] . In addition, several studies have shown that adoptive transfer of either Th1 or Th2 cells efficiently boost the generation of neutralizing antiviral IgG responses [29, 30] . Accordingly, a separate study in SFTS patients suggests that patients with severe disease produce lower levels of IgG and IgM antibodies during early infection than patients with a mild form of the disease [7] . Although the percentage of Th1 and Th2 cells was increased in the acute phase and in patients who eventually died from the disease, decreased counts of Th1 and Th2 cells may impact the function of cellular and humoral immune responses, thus affecting viral removal. Additionally, Tregs have been shown to limit pathology during viral infection, including West Nile virus and respiratory syncytial viral infections [31, 32] . However, data from an observational clinical study [33] indicated that an increased Treg cell ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients at the time of admission is an independent risk factor for 30-day mortality. Additionally, a decreased number of Tregs in the deceased patients may decrease their function and thus limit the magnitude of the immune response against pathogens and control of inflammatory reactions. Interestingly, our dynamic data suggested that, unlike other CD4 T-cell subsets, the number of Th17 cells was higher during early infection in the deceased patients than that in the surviving patients. Previous studies have indicated that Th17cells up-regulate anti-apoptotic molecules and thus increase persistent infection by inhibiting the apoptosis of infected cells and desensitizing target cell killing by T effector cells [34] . Additional studies [35, 36] suggest that Th17 cells mediate tissue inflammation by supporting neutrophil recruitment and survival and by inducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. In a word, lower numbers of Th1, Th2 and Treg cells and relatively higher numbers of Th17 cells Statistical analysis was performed via a non-parametric Spearman correlation test. In the graphs, r and p indicate the correlation coefficient and the p-value of significance, respectively. The level of significance is indicated as follows: ns, not significant; *p < .05; **p < .01; ***p < .001; ****p < .0001. may affect the direct antiviral functions of these cells in providing assistance to B cells, regulating immunopathology and mediating the cytotoxic killing of virus-infected cells.",

            "text": "In addition to the observed CD4 T-cell depletion, the cellular microenvironment was altered in the deceased patients. Given the nonsynchronous changes in the Th, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells, we used Th1/ Th2 and Th17/Treg ratios to define the relationship between the inflammation status and the regulatory condition of the immune system. Our study demonstrated that in the peripheral blood, the Th1/Th2 ratio decreased and the Th17/Treg ratio increased in the deceased patients compared with those in the patients who survived. Previous studies have suggested that Th2 bias is related to the pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and to infection severity in both humans and mice [18, 37] . However, no studies have shown that the Th1/Th2 ratio has the potential to predict death. In addition, several studies indicated that Th17/Tregs imbalance is significantly correlated with the severity of traumatic haemorrhagic shock and ARDS in patients [16, 38] . Furthermore, similar to previous studies that related to hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACHBLF) patients and ARDS patients [38, 39] , an increased Treg/Th17 ratio was associated with the survival of SFTS patients. Moreover, our data showed that increased ratio of Th17/Tregs was associated with an increased level of IL-6. Previous studies [40, 41] suggest that the Th17/ Treg imbalance that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients could be corrected by tocilizumab (TCZ)-mediated blockade of IL-6 signals, which is associated with improved clinical outcomes. Additionally, the Th17 response can be suppressed by Treg cells from patients who respond to treatment with adalimumab (a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor), via the control of monocyte-derived IL-6 production [42] . Given that decreases in CD4 T cells and Th1/Th2 ratio and increases in Th17/Tregs ratio were associated with disease severity, increasing the number of CD4 T cells and rectifying the Th2 and Th17 bias may help to maintain the immune system in a steady state, thus producing a therapeutic benefit.",

Our data shed some light on the development of the disease and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism underlying the progression of SFTS.
