Important history to understand from caretakers includes: age of pigs affected, duration of clinical signs, morbidity rate, mortality rate, treatments administered, response to treatments, and any other important information regarding previous diagnoses or disease in the affected group of animals. This is also the time to examine any production records that have been kept on the affected group of swine as well as previous groups for comparison. Records include but are not limited to: where the animals originated from; number in the herd; age; daily mortality; number treated; name of treatment, route of delivery and dose; feed and water usage; high-low temperatures; and vaccinations received or administered. After examining the production records and obtaining a history, proceed with a visual examination of the herd. Typically, it is a biosecurity custom to observe youngest groups first; however, in cases of suspected infectious diseases, it may be best to begin with the healthiest group advancing in order of increasing severity or prevalence.",

A postmortem examination, or necropsy, of affected pigs should occur last. Any pigs recently deceased of natural causes should be examined to establish trends, with the understanding that submission of tissues from these animals may not yield valuable diagnostic results. Tissues for diagnostic evaluation should be collected from clinically affected pigs that are euthanized immediately before necropsy. Sampling of five or more pigs may be required to obtain a valuable diagnosis. When investigating signs referable to the central nervous system (CNS), it is important to preserve brain and spinal cord tissue for microscopic evaluation in cases of neurological disease; therefore, blunt force trauma and brain penetration by captive bolt are not preferred methods of euthanasia. At minimum, fresh and formalin-fixed tissue samples should include: brain, tonsil, heart, lung, lymph nodes, spleen, kidney, liver, and intestine. Additional samples that may be beneficial for diagnosis include: premortem whole blood and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-chelated blood (for serum chemistry and complete blood count), spinal cord, intact stifle and hock joints (remove the leg at the hip), intact eyeball with optic nerve attachment, urine, feed, and water. Consult a diagnostic lab regarding any additional samples that may be required in determining an etiologic diagnosis.

Observational studies implicate sows as carriers and piglets are colonized as they pass through the birth canal (Amass et al., 1996) . Disease occurs most frequently during the suckling and postweaning period. Commingling pigs from different herds, concurrent infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), and other stress factors may increase the risk of developing S. suis meningitis (Villani, 2002; Thanawongnuwech et al., 2000) . Variable morbidity and mortality: mortality depends on early recognition and treatment. Clinical signs of S. suis meningitis include paddling, recumbency, nystagmus, and seizure. Isolation of S. suis from the lung, nasal secretions, or tonsil from normal pigs is clinically insignificant. In contrast, S. suis isolation from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meninges, joints, endocardium, or serosal surfaces with or without lesions is relevant (Pijoan, 1994) . Few to no gross lesions may be observed during necropsy. Early recognition of clinical signs followed by injection with an antimicrobial that S. suis is susceptible is the most effective means of treatment. Administering an antimicrobial that S. suis is susceptible to in the drinking water has been proposed to control morbidity (Villani, 2002) . Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for S. suis isolates from regional diagnostic laboratories can be used to assist in selection of an appropriate antimicrobial while diagnostic tests are pending; ceftiofur is effective . Commercial and autogenous vaccines are available but due to S. suis serologic diversity may not be effective .",

Infections are not clinically or grossly distinguishable from S. suis. Definitive diagnosis is by bacterial isolation. However, HPS is a fastidious gram-negative rod and culture media must be supplemented with V factor for successful isolation. Owing to the difficulty in isolating HPS, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are a suitable alternative (Oliveira et al., 2001) . Like S. suis, isolation from the airways has little significance unless lesions are present (Hoefling, 1994) .

            "text": "Edema disease results when a fimbrial (F18 or F4) and shiga-like toxin (StX-2e) positive strain of Escherichia coli successfully attaches to brush border receptors releasing toxin that damages blood vessels including those of the blood-brain barrier causing edema and encephalomalacia. Edema disease most commonly affects rapidly growing pigs, 2 weeks postweaning. Morbidity is moderate to high and mortality is high. Acute death of robust pigs, ataxia, eyelid swelling, and diarrhea are typical clinical signs (Rademacher, 2001) . At necropsy, edema may be observed in the mesentery between the loops of the spiral colon and in the cardiac region of the gastric mucosa. Stomachs are usually full of feed. Bacteriologic isolation of a \u03b2-hemolytic strain of E. coli from affected pigs with meningoencephalitis is not sufficient for a diagnosis. Genotyping is necessary to confirm that the E. coli isolated was F18 or F4 and StX-2e positive and thus capable to induce such lesions. There is no effective treatment. Vaccination using an avirulent live culture of E. coli postweaning, thorough cleaning and disinfection between groups, and use of genetically resistance breeds that lack the fimbrial receptor are preventatives (Fairbrother and Gyles, 2006) . Pseudorabies (PRV), also known as Aujezsky's disease, is caused by a herpesvirus. PRV was eradicated from the US commercial swine herd in 2004 (USDA APHIS, 2008) . Feral swine are potential reservoirs. Cattle, sheep, dogs, and cats can also be infected with PRV. High morbidity is due to large quantities of virus shed in saliva and nasal secretions for several weeks following infection. Mortality is inversely related to age approaching 100% in neonates. Clinical signs are also age dependent. Neonates may die without signs. Suckling and recently weaned pigs are those that commonly exhibit ataxia, tremors, excess salivation, and seizures. At necropsy, the brain appears congested and hemorrhagic. Necrotic foci occur in the spleen, liver, lung, lymph node, and specifically tonsils. Histopathologic lesions are characterized by nonsuppurative meningitis and intranuclear inclusion bodies. PCR, virus isolation (VI), immunohistochemistry (IHC), or fluorescent antibody can be used to confirm the diagnosis. No specific treatment is available. Vaccination and eradication are effective for control (USDA APHIS, 2008) . In areas free of PRV, suspicion of the disease should be reported to state and federal agencies as required.",

Fighting over water access is the first clinical sign and occurs within hours. Dog-sitting, opisthotonous, convulsions, and fighting over water follow and develop after 24 h without water. Removal of the brain from an affected animal reveals edema and eosinophilic meningoencephalitis with perivascular cuffing and this is pathognomonic (Gudmundson and Meagher, 1961) .

Gastric ulcers have a wide variety of causes but are most commonly associated with small feed particle size (Ayles et al., 1996) and interruption of feed intake whether caused by disease or poor management. It is common to see signs consistent with gastric ulceration increase following an acute PRRS or influenza outbreak. Morbidity and mortality vary with the scope of the underlying cause. Clinical signs include regurgitation, vomiting, pallor or jaundice, and acute death. An acutely dead pig with blood in its stomach is indicative of an active ulcer and is sufficient evidence for a diagnosis. In chronic cases, ulceration causes hyperplasia resulting in stricture of the pars esophagea and regurgitation. Feeding a coarse ground diet for 3 weeks significantly decreases severity (Ayles et al., 1996) but is impractical in modern production facilities.",

Four serogroups infect swine: A, B, C, and E (the latter only reported from the United Kingdom). In addition, infections with particular serogroups vary by age: Type C mostly in suckling piglets and Type A predominately in nursery pigs (Stephenson et al., 2013) . Type A is the most prevalent serogroup. Severity of disease decreases with age and is self-limiting. The virus infects and destroys villous enterocytes resulting in villous atrophy. In response, crypt cells fill in the gaps but, because they are incapable of absorption, suckling piglets quickly loose body condition and have a gaunt or wasted appearance. Neither clinical signs nor gross lesions are pathognomonic although loops of small intestine appear thinwalled with moderate to large amounts of watery contents. A histopathologic report of blunted villi and crypt hyperplasia is suggestive of rotavirus infection. Infection with rotavirus can be confirmed by PCR or electron microscopy (EM). Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is also available but limited to detection of serogroup A. IHC and EM detect rotavirus and confirm its role in pathology, but both tests lack Table 2 Common gastrointestinal diseases and disorders of pigs Note: The first column provides the diseases.

Acidifiers and antibiotics are sometimes administered to control secondary bacterial infections. Treatment success is variable and depends on the degree of malnourishment. Prevention among neonatal piglets is through ingestion of lactogenic virus neutralizing antibody from the sow, which is stimulated by administering feedback of Rotavirus positive piglet feces or intestines (Arruda et al., 2011) or a modified-live commercial Type A vaccine no less than 3 weeks before farrowing. A modified-live commercial Type A vaccine is also available for pigs. It does not induce cross-protection for other serogroups and may be cost-prohibitive. TGE is caused by TGEv, a coronavirus that is heat labile at temperatures above 21 1C, prone to dessication and photosensitization (Bay et al., 1952) . The epidemic form causes acute disease in all age groups within as little as 18 h of infection. Morbidity and mortality is high, approaching 100%, in an epizootic outbreak. The severity of disease is age dependent but all ages will develop diarrhea (Moeser and Blikslager, 2007) . Postweaning infections result in high morbidity but low mortality; the most significant economic losses at this time are caused by reduced average daily gain, market weights, and overall system efficiency. Necropsy reveals that the small intestine and colon are fluid filled, the small intestinal wall is thin almost translucent, and lacteals are empty. Necrosis and atrophy are observed throughout the length of the villus. The colon and cecum are spared. The endemic form occurs when susceptible animals are introduced to the herd or after maternal antibody wanes. Prior exposure to porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) may cause false-positive antibody test results. A TGEv/PRCV differential ELISA is available. In an outbreak, sows are fed tissue of diarrheic pigs to stimulate herd immunity and new introductions of animals are stopped. After the exposure and a subsequent cool-down period of 4-6 months or after clinical signs cease, sentinels can be introduced and monitored for seroconversion (Saif and Sestak, 2006) . Absence of seroconversion indicates successful elimination of TGEv. Commercial vaccines are available but should be used with caution and only when elimination is not an option.",

Prevalence of the enzootic form is approximately 50% (Chae et al., 2000) . Morbidity approaches 100% and mortality is 80% or more in a na\u00efve sow herd resulting in 3-5 weeks of production losses.

Postweaning infections result in a high morbidity but low mortality; most significant economic losses at this time are caused by reduced average daily gain, market weights, and overall system efficiency. Viral shedding occurs up to 10 days postinfection. Reproductive failure and inefficiency is a sequela of an outbreak (Olanratmanee et al., 2010) . TGEv/PEDv differential PCR is available to confirm a presumptive diagnosis of PED. Serum can be submitted for ELISA or immunofluorescent antibody but collected no sooner than 3 weeks after diarrhea was o bserved. Immunoprophylaxis using egg antibody or hyperimmune serum and supportive care including electrolyte administration have been used for treatment.

Rodents, particularly mice, are known vectors and can serve as reservoirs. Brachyspira hyodysenteriae is the species known for causing SD. Other species of Brachyspira have been recently described in dysentery-like disease (Burrough, 2012) . Incubation is 10-14 days but disease occurs in a 3-4 week cycle. Administration of tiamulin or lincomycin in the feed or water may alter the time to onset of signs after exposure. Morbidity is high and mortality is low to moderate characteristically causing disease in only the finisher and mature groups. Economic significance is mostly lost performance due to reduced daily gain and feed conversion. The specific mechanism of pathogenesis is not well understood but the spirochete does not invade the lamina propria. Clinical signs are the presence of mucohemorrhagic diarrhea containing flakes of frank blood or appearing as a generalized brick red to rust color. Lesions are mostly observed in the spiral colon where epithelial sloughing and mucosal invasion cause necrosis resulting in the formation of a pseudomembrane. The colonic walls may be thickened due to vascular congestion and mucosal hyperplasia. Bacterial culture produces strong \u03b2-hemolysis. PCR test for confirmation and speciation is recommended for any isolate with characteristic growth. Introduction of infected pigs and contaminated equipment or facilities are the source of infection. Pleuromutilins, like tiamulin, and the lincosamide, lincomycin, are effective for treatment. However, if the environment remains contaminated, clinical signs will recur. Depopulation has resulted in successful eradication (Harms, 2011) . Medicated elimination that combines thorough pulse medication with tiamulin, cleaning and disinfection, and employment of an aggressive rodent control program is also effective (Burrough and Sexton, 2013) .",

Escherichia coli colonize the small intestine by fimbria that binds receptors on the villous surface of enterocytes. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) then produce toxin(s) that increase osmolality leading to diarrhea (Moeser and Blikslager, 2007) . ETEC is subdivided by fimbria, toxin, and age of pig affected. Neonatal diarrhea (ND) is most common in pigs 0-7 days of age. The onset of postweaning diarrhea (PWD) caused by F18 is delayed, occurring 5-14 days postweaning, compared to that caused by F4 and its severity is indirectly related to wean age. Clinical signs are profuse diarrhea, rapid dehydration leading to emaciation, or death due to metabolic acidosis. Fluid filled and hyperemic sections of jejunum and ileum may be present at necropsy but few consistent gross lesions occur. Intestinal contents have a distinctly alkaline pH. Isolation of large numbers of E. coli and with dense layers of rod-shaped bacteria covering villi seen on histopathology in samples from pigs with diarrhea is sufficient for diagnosis of E. coli but not ETEC. Genotyping is necessary to determine fimbria and toxin types, which are essential to confirm diagnosis of ETEC. Treatment of affected pigs/litters/groups includes administration of antibiotics and oral rehydration solution or electrolytes to correct hyperkalemia (Kiers et al., 2006) . Control and prevention of ND is by passively derived lactogenic immunoglobins from vaccinated females (Kohler, 1974) . Prevention of PWD include selection of genetically resistant breeds lacking K88 and F18 receptors, administration of an oral avirulent live culture to stimulate active immunity or competitively exclude field strains (Genovese et al., 2000) , feeding 2500 ppm zinc oxide postweaning and probiotics. Immunity and exclusion is unique to each fimbria; vaccines should include the prevalent genotype(s) causing the diarrhea.",

Frequency of CpA diarrhea is on the rise in the USA. In uncomplicated cases, mortality is low whereas morbidity is high and below average weaning weights result. Cases of CpA diarrhea are associated with the expression of \u03b1 and \u03b2 2 toxin. CpA is cultured from the stomach and upper third of small intestine but does not bind intestinal epithelium causing few to no histologic lesions. Because of its ubiquitous nature and prevalence among health pigs, CpA may be an opportunist and its role as a primary cause of neonatal enteritis is not definitive. Large numbers (3 \u00fe or 4 \u00fe ) of gram-positive bacilli cultured from feces or intestinal contents of diarrheic pigs is suggestive of CpA. Genotyping by PCR to confirm presence of cpb2 gene in CpA isolates and rule out of other causes of ND are supportive to the diagnosis (Bueschel et al., 2003 ). Treatment has variable success rates and is limited to administration of empirically selected antibiotics and oral rehydration solutions to affected piglets. Control of CpA enteritis is best accomplished by preventing other causes of ND. Following a thorough cleaning, sporicidal disinfectant should be applied to farrowing crates and equipment between litters and be allowed to dry before reloading. Feeding of bacitracin to sows has resulted in significant increases in weaning weights (Schultz, 2007) . A commercial CpA toxoid vaccine is available (Hammer et al., 2008) . Autogenous whole cell vaccines are also in use. If vaccine is unavailable, feedback might be considered but should be pursued with caution (Robbins and Byers, 2013a) .",

Gross necropsy reveals hemorrhagic and blood-filled loops of small intestine. A pseudomembrane may form on the luminal surface, and intestinal mucosa is edematous. Gross and histopathologic lesions in the presence of large numbers (3 \u00fe or 4 \u00fe ) of grampositive bacilli cultured from feces or intestinal contents warrant a presumptive diagnosis. Genotyping by PCR to confirm presence of the cpb gene is confirmatory (Songer and Uzal, 2005) . Treatment of affected piglets is unrewarding due to the rapid and debilitating course of this disease. Prevention is accomplished by vaccination of gestating females with a commercial toxoid and ensuring piglets consume sufficient colostral antibodies to result in protection.",

            "text": "PPE, commonly referred to as ileitis, is the general categorization of infections caused by Lawsonia intracellularis, an obligate intracellular bacterium. Because the bacteria cause lesions in the ileum, PPE is also referred to as ileitis. Seroprevalence in grow-finish herds can reach 100%. PPE can further be divided into four clinical forms (Kroll et al., 2005) . Porcine intestinal adenomatosis (PIA) is most common in 6-20 week pigs and causes little mortality. Porcine hemorrhagic enteritis (PHE) affecting pigs 28 weeks of age and older including breeding swine and can be associated with increased mortality and dark, bloody stools. Necrotic enteritis (NE) and subclinical ileitis, the most common form, occur among postweaning pigs. In all forms, transmission is by the fecaloral route. Crypt enterocytes infected with L. intracellularis become hyperplastic. The altered ratio of villous and crypt enterocytes leads to malabsorption and subsequent increases in feed conversion and time to reach market weights. PIA results in variable degrees of thickened ileum that can be found at necropsy. The ileal lumen may contain a blood clot in PHE or pseudomembrane in NE. When diarrhea ranging in color from normal (PIA, NE, and subclinical) to dark-red or black (PHE) is observed, PPE should be considered as a possible cause. Subclinical ileitis usually causes no clinical signs (Gebhart, 2007) . Histopathologic lesions containing intracellular S-shaped organisms are suggestive of Lawsonia infection but IHC should be used to confirm diagnosis. PCR is helpful to detect infection and is highly specific but moderately sensitive. Cross-sectional or longitudinal serologic profiling using a widely available ELISA is the best tool for determining timing of exposure. Treatment is with effective antibiotics, such as tylosin, administered by injection or in the feed or water. Control is by administration of a commercially available modified-live oral vaccine before infection or feeding antibiotics when infection is known to occur. Vaccination should take place at least 8 weeks before seroconversion (Walter et al., 2004) .",

Isolation of multidrug resistance strains of S. Typhimurium from swine at slaughter have garnered attention from public health and food safety professionals and it is this that make this infection significant to the pork industry (Foley et al., 2008) . Some European Union member states have implemented meat-juice serologic monitoring at slaughter to assess on-farm Salmonella control programs. Pathogenesis of S. Typhimurium is similar to Salmonella cholerasuis by invading enterocytes and subsequently macrophages leading to an infectious carrier state. Initial infection causes inflammation and cytokine release that result in watery, yellow diarrhea containing feed particles. Button ulcers may be visible on the mucosal surfaces of the colon and cecum on gross necropsy examination and, on histopathology, can be found to extend into the lamina propria. Bacterial isolation without using enrichment media and the presence of histopathologic lesions is consistent with a diagnosis of Salmonella enteritis. Treatment is with antibiotics administered symptomatically to diarrheic pigs. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolate should be considered before initiating treatment. Rearing pigs on slatted floors, decreasing stocking density, and acidification of digesta are effective in reducing the prevalence of Salmonella infections in swine (Funk and Gebreyes, 2004; Boyen et al., 2008) . Cross-protection with S. cholerasuis vaccine has been reported and reduces carcass colonization (Husa et al., 2009) .",

The egg is not immediately infective, which requires 3-4 weeks in the environment. The infectious larva hatches from the egg and invades enterocytes in the small intestine and cecum. The entire life cycle of T. suis is completed in the intestine. Ulcerations in the mucosa and damage to capillary blood supply of intestinal epithelium lead to hemorrhage, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Clinical signs are depressed weight gain, increased feed conversion, bloody diarrhea, ill thrift, and death. Adult worms imbedded in the ileum, cecum, or proximal colon are sufficient for diagnosis of whipworms. Eggs are intermittently shed and thus not a reliable method of diagnosis (Pittman et al., 2010a) .

Unaffected pigs with direct contact with affected pigs should also be treated to control spread. In cases where pigs exhibit systemic signs, administration of an injectable antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory is warranted. In the United States, no antimicrobials are labeled for the treatment, control or prevention of S. hyicus so all antimicrobial therapy is extra-label. Prevention should focus on facility hygiene and include a soap degreaser and disinfectant regimen to reduce contamination. In addition, scarification of the skin of breeding age females with the farmspecific S. hyicus strain can reduce disease incidence in suckling pigs (Murray and Rademacher, 2008) . Erysipelas or diamond skin disease is caused by a soilborne gram-positive bacterium, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. This zoonotic pathogen is transmitted by migratory fowl, turkeys, and pigs. Humans may become sickened when direct contact with blood from affected animals contaminates an open wound (Brooke and Riley, 1999) . The finding of lesions at slaughter results in partial or complete carcass condemnation (Bender et al., 2011) . The disease is most common in growing, finishing, and breeding age swine. Bacterial emboli lodge in blood vessels causing vasculitis, thrombosis, and ischemia leading to lameness, abortions in gestating females, and raised, red to purple rhomboid skin lesions for which erysipelas is best known. Skin biopsies from the affected area should include epidermis and dermis, but histologic lesions are only supportive. Bacteriologic isolation or PCR identifying E. rhusiopathiae confirms the diagnosis. Treatment with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics including penicillin is effective.

Infestation and subsequent clinical signs in the breeding herd, most notably an incessant scratching, develop following the purchase of infested genetic replacements. In addition, growing pigs placed in facilities that previously housed infected swine or facilities that reuse straw bedding or have solid wood partitions may also become infested. The mite is rare in modern, high-health swine operations. The burrowing mite causes red pustules and flaking skin. Individual pigs may develop signs in as few as 3 weeks but a herd may not show signs for several months. In the chronic stage, thick crusts develop at the corners of and inside the ears. Examination of a scraping from the crusts will reveal the mite (Averbeck and Stromberg, 1993 ). An ELISA test is used to determine prior exposure and determine success of eradication programs. Treatment can be applied topically using an antiparasitic, such as amitraz, to temporarily alleviate clinical signs.

Transmission is vertical from sow to pigs and lateral between pigs (Ross and Spear, 1973) . M. hyosynoviae is most often diagnosed during the grow-finish phase. Morbidity is variable but mortality is low. Clinical signs are a stiff gait and difficulty in standing, most often the stifle or elbow and less frequently the hock, hip, and shoulder. Signs often occur 2-3 weeks after a stressful event; lesions begin to resolve 7 weeks postinfection. The affected joint contains yellow or blood-tinged effusion with moderate villous proliferation but is not always observed despite lameness and does not necessarily correlate with presence of histopathologic lesions. Aseptic collection of synovial fluid by needle aspiration or sterile swab or submission of the affected joint intact is recommended for diagnosis. PCR is the most sensitive test; culture requires special media and lacks sensitivity (Gomes Neto et al., 2012) . Histopathologic examination of formalin-fixed synovium reveals nonsuppurative fibrinous polyarthritis and lymphoplasmacytic perivascular synovitis. ELISA is also available. Lincomycin has historically been an effective therapeutic choice (Burch and Godwin, 1984) . Treatment should be initiated when lameness is first observed; however, spontaneous resolution is common.

            "text": "Reproductive failure occurs when insemination fails to result in pregnancy or pregnancy fails to produce viable pigs due to infectious and noninfectious causes summarized in Table 5 . Reproductive failure should be considered when a low conception or farrowing rate, irregular returns to estrus, abortions, stillbirths, or mummies persist at an abnormal rate. Infertility occurs when fewer than four embryos are present at the time of maternal recognition of pregnancy resulting in a regular return to estrus and reduced conception rate for that breeding group. Irregular returns to estrus result from embryonic death or early term abortion after implantation but before calcification of the fetuses. Embryonic death of some or all of the embryos will result in low total born or irregular return to estrus, respectively. Early term abortion also will reduce farrowing rates. Mummies and stillborns can occur any time after calcification of the fetuses. The normal rates for mummies and stillborns are o0.5 and o1 pig per litter, respectively. Late-term abortions are classified as those occurring after 70 days of gestation. Total abortion rate should remain o2% of a breeding group. These are general guidelines; thus, familiarity with the herd's normal reproductive performance is the most sensitive means to identify a reproductive problem. PRRS is, at this time, known only to occur among swine. The estimated cost of PRRS to the US pork industry is US$664 million annually (Holtkamp et al., 2013) . PRRS usually results when susceptible swine are infected with either the Leylystad or North American strains of PRRS virus (PRRSv), a member of the Arteriviridae family. Viremia lasts up to 42 days, but shedding of infectious virus can last much longer (Murtaugh and Genzow, 2011) . PRRSv is most commonly transmitted by introduction of infected swine or contaminated fomites, use of contaminated semen, and aerosol. The pathogenesis of the reproductive form is believed to be arteritis of fetal umbilical cords during gestation (Lager and Halbur, 1996) . Swine may show no signs when reinfected with a homologous strain. Conversely, infection with a heterologous strain will reproduce lesions and disease but is usually less severe than that of na\u00efve swine (Murtaugh and Genzow, 2011) . Clinical signs of PRRS in a breeding herd start with an epidemic of abortions followed by an increase in low viable piglets, stillbirths, and mummies. Abortions result due to fetal death or pyrexia of the gestating female. Sows and gilts may be anorexic, pyrexic, or lethargic. Periparturient females may become agalactic. In severe outbreaks of PRRS, sow mortality also increases. In utero infection of feti can result in persistently infected piglets (Rossow, 1998) . Prewean mortality commonly increases and may remain above the herd average for weeks. Diagnosis can be made by submitting lung, spleen, and lymph node from fetuses or low viable piglets. Whole fetuses can also be submitted but should be refrigerated to prevent autolysis. Lesions are not pathognomonic so confirmatory testing such as PCR, IHC, or VI should be conducted. Tissues and thoracic fluid from stillbirths, aborted, or mummified feti can be submitted but may result in false negatives. Serum collected from aborted sows or low viable piglets and tested for PRRSv by PCR is another option for diagnosis. PRRSv ELISA indicates previous exposure but is not useful in a previously exposed herd. Treatment of PRRS is supportive. Anti-inflammatories to reduce fever and antibiotics for control and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia may be necessary. The most common methods for control include depopulationrepopulation and herd closure and rollover, also called loadclose-homogenize, using commercial vaccine or herd-specific live virus exposure (Corzo et al., 2010) . Periods of closure vary based on facility capacity but a minimum of 180 days is recommended. Commercial modified-live and killed vaccines are available but do not prevent infection and should be used in accordance with label and domestic guidelines.",

Clinical signs of PPV range from low total born, mummies of various sizes, irregular returns to estrus, and females diagnosed pregnant but fail to farrow. Diagnosis is based on vaccination history, clinical signs, and PCR testing of mummified fetuses. PPV ELISA may provide diagnostic value if acute and convalescent serum samples are used. There is no effective treatment for PPV; however, commercial killed vaccines are available and very effective. Exposure of unbred females to tissue or cull sows from a seropositive herd has been used for immunization when vaccine is unavailable. Leptospirosis is caused by infection by spirochete bacteria. Leptospira species may be zoonotic (Leptospira canicola, L. icterohemorrhagiae), swine-adapted (L. pomona and L. bratislava), or incidentally infect swine (L. grippotyphosa and L. hardjo). Infection has been associated with exposure of swine to contaminated soil or untreated surface water, and exposure to urine from infected vectors, such as rodents. Infected swine can become carriers resulting in chronic disease. The pathogenesis is due to bacteremia resulting in transplacental infection followed by fetal death. Clinical signs include pyrexia, low conception rate, abortion, stillbirths, and low viability pigs resulting in increased prewean mortality. Diagnosis is made using dark field microscopy or IHC performed on tissues, particularly kidney, of aborted feti or stillbirths. Paired or matched serology for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing may be useful if suspected. Treatment with antibiotics, such as chlortetracycline, may be pursued (Henry et al., 1993) . Commercial killed bacterins are available to aid in prevention and should be given at least semiannually to breeding stock (Christianson, 1992) but may not be available in all countries.

In addition, breeding females can become infected via insemination with contaminated semen (Madson et al., 2009a) . Gilts and low parity sows are affected most often, whereas boars show no clinical signs. PCV2-associated reproductive failure may occur in conjunction with PPV. Infection results in variable lengths of viremia. PCV2-reproductive failure is due to transplacental infection of fetuses. Clinical signs depend on the stage of gestation when the infection occurs. Embryonic death, early term abortions, stillbirths, mummies, low total born, or low viable pigs can result from infection. Mummies may vary in size, like PPV, and measuring crown to rump length is useful to determine the time when that fetus was infected. PCV2-reproductive failure is diagnosed by the presence of viral antigen confirmed by IHC or deoxyribonucleic acid confirmed by PCR along with the presence of lesions in fetal tissue notably myocardial mineralization.

The pathogenesis of PRV results from viremia, and then replication and necrosis of epithelial tissue including the placenta (Christianson, 1992) . The period of viremia gives PRV time to cross the placenta and cause fetal death. Clinical signs following acute infection include embryonic death, abortion, mummies, and stillborns. Necrotic foci can be found in fetal spleen, liver, lung, and lymph node. Histopathology is not definitive; IHC is required to confirm presence of antigen. Diagnosis may also be made through serology; a commercial ELISA test is available and can differentiate between exposure to the gene-deleted vaccine and wild-type virus used extensively in the US eradication. Commercial PRV vaccines are available but only should be used in accordance with federal guidelines.",

The most notable infectious agents are the viral pathogens, PRRS and PCV2, which cause primary pathologic lesions to both the respiratory and the immune system. This damage to the immune system often leads to respiratory or systemic disease incited by secondary infectious agents.

Morbidity and mortality are strain-specific; virulence varies with expression of ApxI and ApxII toxins. Inhalation of strains of APP expressing Apx toxins results in lung lesions within 24-36 h. The disease is economically significant because mortality occurs during the later part of the finishing phase, usually just before slaughter. Clinical signs of fever, lethargy, dyspnea, and acute death are common. Pigs found dead may have a frothy, blood-tinged discharge from the nose and mouth. Focal hemorrhage occurs in the diaphragmatic lung lobe, which is firm, and its appearance is likened to that of a bull's eye. Fibrinous, necrotizing bronchopneumonia containing streaming leukocytes is a key histopathologic feature. Bacterial culture is difficult and requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-supplemented media so diagnosis is traditionally made on finding characteristic postmortem and histopathologic lesions. A PCR test is also available. In an outbreak, the entire population should receive antimicrobial therapy parentally. Unlike many other gram-negative bacteria, APP is sensitive to a variety of antimicrobials; at Iowa State University VDL 490% of isolates were sensitive to ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tiamulin, tilmicosin, and tulathromycin.

Like APP, outbreaks should be treated by parental delivery of an antimicrobial; however, treatment of only those individual pigs with clinical signs is usually sufficient. Autogenous vaccines can be used for control but response is variable because most pigs are already seropositive at the time of vaccination. Ascaris suum, the swine roundworm, is the most common parasitic infection of swine. The reduced growth performance and liver condemnations are responsible for economic losses (Stewart and Hoyt, 2006) . The prepatent period is 40-53 days. Adult roundworms are present in the manure but it is the migration of larvae through the lungs, occurring 8-10 days after ingestion of an infective egg that causes respiratory signs. A persistent cough and dyspnea result due to verminous pneumonia. The liver develops whitish spots, called 'milk spots' that are the cause of condemnations but resolve within 25 days (Stewart and Hoyt, 2006) . The presence of eosinophils is suggestive of a parasite infestation. Treatment and control is accomplished using anthelmintics: dichlorvos, fenbendazole, levamisole eliminate adults and larvae; piperazine kills only adults. Proper cleaning and disinfection particularly removing fecal material between groups reduces potential for exposure but it is virtually impossible to get rid of A. suum once a premise is infested (Pittman et al., 2010b) .

Clinical signs include sneezing, deviated snouts, and, in cases of PAR, bloody nasal discharge occurring in a large number of grow-finish pigs. Mortality is low but the reduced growth that results due to AR makes it economically important. Beacause the cytotoxins are responsible for AR, isolation of either bacterium from nasal passages is not sufficient for diagnosis. In addition, B. bronchiseptica and P. multocida colonize the lung leading to bronchopneumonia causing cough and dyspnea in pigs postweaning, often part of PRDC (Hansen et al., 2010) .

The disease is classified as enzootic pneumonia or a component of PRDC. Both manifestations of MH cause paralysis of the mucociliary escalator resulting in a severe cough and dyspnea known as thumping. Vertical and lateral transmission can occur; but, owing to its slow rate of transmission between pigs, the disease primarily occurs in grow-finish pigs (Meyns et al., 2004) . In addition, time of colonization with MH and disease severity are directly related (Fano et al., 2007) . On necropsy, well-demarcated (red to purple lobular consolidation occurs in the apical) diaphragmatic, and accessory lung lobes is visible. Histopathologic lesions characteristic of MH is bronchopneumonia with lymphocytic perivascular, peribronchial, and peribronchiolar cuffing. Because MH is difficult to isolate, PCR is the most sensitive method of detection. ELISA is available and is helpful in establishing herd status but must be interpreted in the context of vaccination as tests do not distinguish between antibodies produced subsequent to vaccination or field infection. Treatment of affected pigs with parental antimicrobials like enrofloxacin, tulathromycin, or lincomycin or administration of water-soluble lincomycin, tiamulin, or tetracyclines to affected groups is effective in outbreaks. Control can be achieved through pulse-medication in feed of chlortetracycline (Thacker et al., 2006) beginning Figure 3 Epicarditis, heart, nursery pig.

Morbidity and mortality is variable, often dependent on the occurrence of secondary infections and their virulence. Survivors of PCVAD remain stunted, owing to the economic significance of this collection of diseases. Clinical signs include wasting, dyspnea, depression, ill thrift, and diarrhea. Lungs are wet, heavy, and fail to collapse; pulmonary edema and lymphadenopathy also can be found at necropsy. Histopathology results include presence of interstitial pneumonia, lymphoid depletion, enteritis, nephritis, and dermatitis. For a diagnosis of PCVAD the following must occur: PCV2 antigen within characteristic lesions and lymph nodes are depleted (Sorden, 2008) . IHC is used to confirm presence of PCV2 antigen within the histopathologic lesion. PCR has little value in diagnosing PCVAD unless the herd is considered free. Commercial vaccines are very effective and available with flex labels for administration to sows and pigs and as 1 or 2 doses (Chae, 2012) . Nonvaccinated, subclinically infected pigs have poorer weight gain compared to their vaccinated counterparts (Kristensen et al., 2011) ; therefore, it is part of most vaccination protocols by US pork producers ( Figure 4) .",

The estimated cost of PRRS to the US pork industry is US$664 million annually (Holtkamp et al., 2013) . PRRSv is the most commonly diagnosed viral respiratory pathogen at VDLs (Gauger, 2009) . Infection is observed to increase susceptibility to other infections, particularly opportunistic bacteria. This apparent increased susceptibility to secondary and opportunistic infections is the result of the pathologic process in which PRRSv recruits and replicates in pulmonary alveolar macrophages, and then disseminates systemically (Rossow, 1998) . Clinical signs are nonspecific including fever, lethargy, and dypsnea but not cough. Signs also depend on the type of secondary infection(s) present. Lungs fail to collapse and appear heavy, wet, and gray on postmortem examinations. Lymphadenopathy is caused by hyperplasia of germinal centers. Interstitial pneumonia, alveoli are lined with hyperplastic type II pneumocytes and contain necrotic debris, whereas the lining of bronchi and bronchioles is normal (Rossow, 1998) . Vasculitis also occurs. PCR is the most sensitive method for confirming infection. Owing to the genetic diversity of PRRSv, sequencing of the ORF5 region is a common adjunct to PCR testing. Sequences are then used to create dendrograms for use by production systems pursuing PRRS control and epidemiologic investigations (Murtaugh, 2012) . PRRSv ELISA is helpful for establishing herd status; National Animal Health Monitoring Service reports that a large percentage of US herds are seropositive. Treatment is limited to maintaining pig comfort, minimizing stress, and controlling secondary infections. Commercial modified-live vaccines (MLV) are available and administration during the nursery phase significantly reduces mortality and improves growth performance during the grow-finish phase of production (Robbins et al., 2013b) . MLV vaccines do replicate and should not be used in negative populations.",

Ingestion or inhalation of the bacteria causes a septicemia resulting in low to moderate morbidity with high mortality within 1-2 days of infection that occurs postweaning, predominately during the grow-finish phase (Baskerville and Dow, 1973) . Signs include high fevers (440 1C), lethargy, dyspnea, acute death, and cyanotic extremities and abdomen. The latter makes it impossible to differentiate clinically from classical swine fever virus (CSFv). Pleuropneumonia, interlobular edema, mediastinal, and tracheobronchial lymphoadenopathy, and occasionally white foci in the liver are apparent postmortem (Turk et al., 1993) . Acute histopathologic lesions that form in the lung are purulent bronchitis, lobular necrosis, and abscessation, whereas paratyphoid nodules are observed in the liver. Isolation is best achieved from the draining lymph nodes, lung, or liver using selective culture media. Serogrouping and typing is necessary for speciation and diagnostic confirmation. Owing to the rapid onset of disease, parental treatment is recommended. Salmonella cholerasuis isolates are commonly susceptible to ceftiofur. Increased hygiene particularly eliminating access to waste and vaccination is preventive (Husa et al., 2009) . SIV is more accurately described as influenza, to encompass the infections occurring in swine, avian, and human species. Influenza virus is classified by its hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins; the three predominant strains in pigs are H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. Rapid transmission and onset are characteristic; in the experimental inoculation of one nonvaccinated nursery age pig resulted in 10.66 more becoming infected (Romagosa et al., 2011) . Virus is shed for 3-5 days and uncomplicated lesions resolve 28 days postinfection (Gramer, 2007) . Nasal discharge, fever, and lethargy occur but resolve quickly. Cough and dyspnea can last up to 2 Figure 4 Pulmonary edema, lung, grow-finish pig. Interlobular edema associated with PCVAD, ventral portion of apical and diaphragmatic lung lobes is consolidated (purple) due to secondary bacterial infection. Courtesy Dr. Glen Almond. weeks postinfection. PCR and VI detect virus for diagnosis of clinical cases. ELISA and HI detect antibodies; ELISA is helpful in establishing herd status, whereas HI is best for vaccination timing and measuring postvaccination titers (Allerson et al., 2008) . Necrotizing bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis as lesion resolves affected areas appear vacuolated. Pigs recover quickly so treatment should focus on maintaining pig comfort, minimizing stress, and controlling secondary infections. All licensed vaccines are killed; commercial and autogenous products are in use in the United States. Vaccination reduces lung lesions and rate of transmission, but does not prevent infection and is complicated by antigenic shift and drift. In the United States, it is typical to vaccinate the sows rather than pigs to control disease and infection (Allerson et al., 2013) .",
