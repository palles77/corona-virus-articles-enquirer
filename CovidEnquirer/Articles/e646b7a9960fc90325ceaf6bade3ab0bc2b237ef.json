We searched for HBoV DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from adults with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or pneumonia, from children hospitalized for acute RTIs, and from asymptomatic children during the winter of 2002-2003 in Canada. HBoV was detected in NPAs of 1 (0.8%) of 126 symptomatic adults, 31 (13.8%) of 225 symptomatic children, and 43 (43%) of 100 asymptomatic children undergoing elective surgery. Another virus was detected in 22 (71%) of the 31 HBoV-positive NPAs from symptomatic children. Two clades of HBoV were identifi ed. The pathogenic role of HBoV in RTIs is uncertain because it was frequently detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and was commonly found with other viruses in symptomatic children.",

Nucleic acid amplifi cation has detected HBoV in respiratory samples of children with acute respiratory disease, with incidence rates ranging from 3% to 19% . However, the pathogenic role of HBoV is uncertain because other viruses have been frequently detected in HBoV-positive children with lower RTIs (range 37%-90%) (2, 3, 7, (9) (10) (11) (20) (21) (22) . The objective of this study was to describe the incidence and clinical manifestations of HBoV infections in children and adults with respiratory tract symptoms, including a control group of children without symptoms.",

Eligible controls were children hospitalized during the same period for any elective surgery (ear, nose, and throat surgeries in 71% of the cases).

Probes were labeled with 6-carboxyfl uorescein (FAM) or tetrachloro-6-carboxyfl uorescein (TET) at the 5\u2032 end and with a quencher at the 3\u2032 end. Amplicons were 81 bp (NP-1) and 74 bp (NS-1), respectively. Duplex amplifi cation was conducted by using 1 \u03bcmol/L NS-1 forward primer and 0.4 \u03bcmol/L NS-1 reverse primer and the 2 NP-1 primers. Taqman probes were used at concentrations of 0.1 mmol/L for the NP-1 gene and 0.2 mmol/L for the NS-1 gene (14) .

(10) identifi ed HBoV DNA in 1% of adults >20 years of age hospitalized with pneumonia in Thailand. Kupfer et al.

We found 1 case of HBoV infection in an adult, which represented 0.8% of the tested population. The HBoV-positive adult did not show immunosuppression but was treated with corticosteroids for a COPD exacerbation.

Fry et al. (10) detected HBoV DNA in only 1% of nasal swabs from asymptomatic patients. Maggi et al. (16) did not detect HBoV DNA in nasal swabs from 51 asymptomatic children (including 30 healthy infants with a mean age of 6 months and 21 preadolescent healthy children with a mean age of 12.8 years). However, these studies analyzed nasal swabs instead of NPA or BAL samples for HBoV detection, which may result in lower rates of viral detection, as shown in symptomatic persons. Allander et al. (2) did not detect HBoV in any of 64 asymptomatic children (median age 4.1 years, range 5 months to 14 years) but used nasal swabs in asymptomatic patients and NPA samples in symptomatic patients. Furthermore, their control group was also older than our population (mean 18.6 months, median 18 months). Kesebir DNA in nasal washes from 96 asymptomatic children <2 years of age seen at a clinic compared with 22 (5.2%) of 425 various samples from symptomatic children sent to a hospital clinical laboratory. None of the previous studies used a control group consisting of children matched for age and week of admission and analyzed the same type of respiratory samples for cases and controls. Our positive results for HBoV were confi rmed by using 2 sets of PCR primers targeting different genes (NP1 and NS1) in a duplex PCR assay and by subsequent testing with a third set of primers (VP1/VP2) for sequencing. Also, sample preparation and PCR amplifi cation were performed in separate laboratory areas following the stringent quality control program of our institution. Thus, it is unlikely that our positive results were due to PCR cross-contamination. Our method was also very sensitive (detection limit = 10 genome copies), which probably enabled an increased in-fection rate compared with previous reports. We cannot exclude the possibility that prior RTIs (in the few weeks preceding sampling) occurred in our asymptomatic children hospitalized for an elective surgery or that HBoV could establish a prolonged infection in children compared with other respiratory viruses. However, the 3\u00d7 higher detection rate in controls than in symptomatic children make these explanations unlikely. We did not quantify HBoV DNA load in samples from our study, which could have been different between asymptomatic and symptomatic children. Nevertheless, we detected hRSV, hMPV, and infl uenza virus RNA in <1% of the same NPA samples from those asymptomatic children compared with a rate of 43% for HBoV DNA (25) . At the very least, our results should raise concerns about the pathogenic role of HBoV in children.",

This result is consistent with fi ndings of other groups from North America and Europe during 2002-2004 and highlights the fact that HBoV lineages do not appear to be geographically clustered (1, 6, 9, 12) . The seasonality of HBoV infection is still a matter of debate, but it seems to involve primarily the colder months of the year (9, 20, 21) . However, most studies, including ours, were performed during the typical respiratory virus season, which may have introduced a bias. Additional studies are needed to address the prevalence of HBoV outside the respiratory virus season and its role in nonrespiratory syndromes. Moreover, the possibility that this virus might be transmitted and isolated in the respiratory tract, but could cause viremia and other clinical syndromes such as gastroenteritis, should be investigated. Vicente et al. analyzed 527 stool samples from children with gastroenteritis and no respiratory symptoms and found a positivity rate of 9.1% for HBoV (with a co-infection rate of 58%) (22) .",
