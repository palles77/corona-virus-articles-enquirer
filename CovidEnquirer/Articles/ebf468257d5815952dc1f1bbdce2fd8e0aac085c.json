By taking Chinese listed companies' donations to May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake as the sample, this research finds that large firms and firms who have political ties donate a significant more to disaster relief than smaller firms and firms who do not have political ties. But the findings indicate that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) donate no more than non SOEs, and service companies donate significantly less than non-service companies. The results of this research partly support the institutional point of view of corporate philanthropy. Firms under high institutional pressure are more likely to donate more than firms facing lower institutional pressure.",

Firms are embedded within a network of relationships that place pressures on them to conform to certain expectations (Hess and Warren, 2008) . Over time, these expectations form the basis of rules that \"function as myths, which organizations incorporate, gaining legitimacy, resources, stability, and enhanced survival prospects\" (Meyer and Rowan 1977, p.340) . In this point of view, firms conduct philanthropic giving so as to secure their legitimacy (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Scott, 1992) and enhance the likelihood of survival (Oliver, 1991) . However, despite the argument from institutional perspective, very few empirical investigations have been conducted to test it.",

Although some scholars discussed the effect of firm size on philanthropic giving from the point of view of institutional pressure, it is still hard to conclude that firms take philanthropic giving as a response to institutional pressure because large firms also have more resources and capability to do so just than smaller firms (a resource-based or slack-resource view). Therefore, to support (or defy) institutional viewpoint of corporate philanthropy, more evidences are needed. Besides, in spite of theoretical pervasiveness, empirical research on corporate donation activities needs developing (Bandeira-de-Mello et al., 2008) , especially the empirical research in developing countries.",

The study offers a unique viewpoint of disaster relief in the largest developing country, namely China. In the absence of prior efforts to empirically test the institutional point of view of corporate social behaviors, this article contributes to our understanding of the socially responsible behaviors of firms in institutional context. The remainder of this paper has the following organization. The following section (Section 2) reviews the corporate giving in China. Section 3 discusses the theoretical background and puts forward relevant hypotheses. Section 4 and 5 test the hypotheses and report the results respectively.

Since the implementation of a reform and openness policy in China in 1978, economy oriented policy leads to the ignorance of CSR. CSR came into China only in the mid-1990s on a tidal wave of social responsibility audits which were launched by numerous multinational organizations involved in mainly consumer goods and the retail sector (Zhou, 2006) . Its expansion and development have to a great extent been in reaction to export requirements, and initially a wait-and-see strategy was adopted by the Chinese government (Tian, 2006) .",

China is now under great pressure to catch up with developed countries where CSR has been developing for much longer. This pressure (to move from a passive approach to a much more proactive one) comes from the Chinese government who is altering its attitude and the degree of attention paid to CSR (Tian, 2006) .",

Thoughts and practices of philanthropy were widespread early in the feudal society of China (Meng, 2005) . Confucianism, a dominant moralpolitical philosophy in China, embodies rich philanthropic thoughts (Warner and Zhu, 2002) . Confucians believe that the nature of human beings is to achieve happiness and to do good. As a result, Confucianism advocates people to be benevolent, philanthropic and humane. Corporate philanthropy is observable everywhere in modern China. The 1998 flood disaster, the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) accident, the 2004 Tsunami of India Ocean, the 2008 frost disaster and the May 12, 2008 Great Wenchuan Earthquake, witness disaster relief donations from individuals and companies. Besides, more and more companies contribute their donations to helping the poor and the disable, supporting education, sanitation, sports and arts, and the like. But unfortunately, no precise data is reported by the government to show how much the corporate donation is.",

The underlying reason that larger firms are more likely to undergo institutional pressures is their higher \"visibility\" in the front of the government and the media or the public. Higher visibility of a firm can attract attention from institutional constituents more easily and thus its managers perceive higher institutional pressures. In China, the most powerful institutional constituents are the state (or the government) and the media or the public (Gao, 2007) . Therefore, firms who have higher visibility in the front of the government, the media and the public may face higher institutional pressures than firms who have lower visibility.",

In addition to assuming economic responsibility (to preserve and increase the value of state-owned assets), SOEs also need to share social responsibilities. \"The Guiding Advice on Fulfilling Social Responsibility by Central Enterprises\" released by SASAC in China expects the SOEs to become \"leading examples\" for all Chinese companies. This legal document embodies the Chinese central government's attitude toward CSR of SOEs (Lin, 2010) . When the state faces disasters or difficulties, SOEs are required and expected to take their responsibilities proactively. Besides, SOEs are also in a vulnerable position to support philanthropic causes because of their high visibility in the front of the state, the media and the public. If SOEs do not act as \"leading examples\" in sharing social responsibilities, they are going to be questioned by the state and the public for not to complying with the advocating of SASAC.",

Therefore, in this study we select the listed companies collected by the two leading websites in Chinathe Baidu.com (http://finance.baidu.com/hongguan/guonei/2008-05-19/ 100237.html) and the Sina.com (http://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/ blank/wcjiuzai.shtml)as the sample. These two websites collect the contributions of thousands of companies. However, among the companies, there are only 295 listed in Chinese domestic stock markets. Besides, since the earthquake took place in May 2008, companies who got listed after May 2008 are not suitable for this study. Finally, some companies made their donation in mixture of the company, the employees and their control shareholder. Therefore, if we cannot distinguish the companies' donation from their employees or control shareholders, we deleted those companies from our sample. By doing so, we finally got a sample consisting of 254 listed companies.",

This is different from the mainstream point of view about corporate philanthropy which argues that firms conduct philanthropy based merely on rational economic considerations. Besides, although Oliver (1991) argues that firms may engage in \"window dressing\" and other symbolic behaviors to avoid sharing social responsibility genuinely, our research finds that they are less likely to avoid their social responsibility under high institutional pressure. Finally, though many scholars identified the potential value of political ties (or even guanxi with other stakeholders) in China, our research demonstrates that the effect of guanxi is dual. Good guanxi with the government also increases a firm's vulnerability to support the government's needs and expectations.",
