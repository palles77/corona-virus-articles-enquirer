The common physical barriers and innate defense mechanisms encountered by all pathogens are discussed first. We then describe, for each class of pathogen in turn, the immune responses commonly mounted against that class of pathogen, followed by a discussion of the evasion strategies employed by that class to stave off destruction. A short discussion of prions, a new category of pathogen that involves infectious proteins, appears at the end of this chapter. Vaccination, which primes a host's immune response to better combat infection, is addressed in Chapter 23.",

There are five major types of pathogens: extracellular bacteria, intracellular bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that are considered prokaryotic because they do not have the \"true\" nucleus found in eukaryotes. The prokaryotic nucleus lacks a nuclear membrane and the genetic material of these organisms is usually contained in a single linear chromosome. Extracellular bacteria do not have to enter host cells to reproduce, while intracellular bacteria do.

            "text": "Infectious diseases were the leading cause of natural deaths until the early part of the 20th century. In 1900, the three most common causes of death in the United States were pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrhea/enteritis. These infectious diseases, along with diphtheria, were responsible for one-third of all deaths. However, due to the late 19th century discovery that specific microorganisms were the cause of such lethal diseases, public health initiatives soon led to dramatic improvements in infectious disease control. Better sanitation and hygiene practices were introduced, including proper sewage disposal, water treatment, and public education about the virtues of handwashing. The discovery of the first antibiotic-penicillin-in 1928 led to its development as a medical treatment beginning in the 1940s. Since that time, many other antibiotics have come into common use, providing cures in countless cases of otherwise fatal bacterial infections. In addition, in North America, Europe, and much of the Pacific Rim, the development of vaccines and effective public vaccination strategies have all but eliminated potentially lethal diseases such as diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella that were once endemic in childhood. The success of these public health measures can hardly be overstated: since 1900, human average life expectancy has increased by 30 years. There has been a corresponding drop in infant and child mortality rates in developed countries such that the proportion of annual deaths in this age group due to infectious disease has fallen to less than 2% from over 30%. Despite these gains, of the approximately 57 million human deaths that occur annually around the world today, about 25% are still due Bacteria have been traditionally classified on the basis of their shapes and groupings, their use of oxygen, and their gram stain status. Despite the advent of DNA technology, these terms of reference remain entrenched in the microbiological research community. For our discussions of bacteria in the context of immunology, we have divided the bacteria into the \"extracellular\" and \"intracellular\" categories, depending on where they live in the body in relation to host cells. Both these categories contain members of each of the groups described here.",

Viruses are acellular particles consisting of a protein coat (called a capsid) encasing a genome of either DNA or RNA. Due to their small size, viruses can only be observed with an electron microscope. To propagate, a virus must enter a host cell possessing protein synthesis machinery that the virus can exploit. Parasites and fungi are eukaryotic organisms that possess several chromosomes contained in a membrane-bounded nucleus. Parasites all share the characteristic of taking advantage of and being dependent on a host organism for both habitat and nutrition at some point in their life cycles, usually damaging the host but not killing it. The major classes of parasites are the protozoa, which are single-celled organisms, and the helminth worms, which are multicellular. While some parasites may be only a few micrometers in size, many are significantly larger, with some worms reaching several meters in length. Fungi are eukaryotic organisms that can exist comfortably outside a host but that will invade and colonize a host if given the opportunity. Fungi may be single-celled, as in the case of yeast, or multicellular, as in bread molds.

This replication may or may not cause visible, clinical damage to the host tissues, symptoms that we call \"disease.\" It should be noted that sometimes the products released by a pathogen, such as bacterial toxins, are sufficient to cause disease even in the absence of widespread pathogen colonization.

Whether an infection is abortive or productive depends on the initial dose of the pathogen accessing the host, the virulence of the organism, and the strength and rapidity of the immune responses mounted to combat the invasion.

The vast majority of microorganisms cannot penetrate the tough I M M U N IT Y TO PATHOG E N S 22 645 keratin layer protecting the epidermis, and any pathogen arriving on the skin surface has to compete with the commensal flora for space and nutrients. Furthermore, the routine shedding of skin layers often deposes a pathogen before it has a chance to establish a firm foothold. Similarly in the mucosae, pathogens ingested into the gut or inhaled into the respiratory tract are for the most part trapped by mucus and secretory IgA coating the mucosal surfaces. Microbicidal molecules in the body secretions and the low pH and hydrolases in the gut also take their toll. However, should there be a wound in the skin or the mucosae that allows a pathogen access to tissues underlying the epithelium, the consequences can be severe. Some organisms are opportunistic pathogens, in that they do not cause disease unless offered an unexpected opportunity by a failure in host defense. Staphylococcus aureus is an example of an extracellular bacterium that is not particularly invasive and that normally colonizes the skin surface without harming the host. If inhaled, S. aureus is successfully repelled by an intact respiratory epithelial layer. However, should the skin experience a tear or the respiratory epithelium be damaged by trauma or another more invasive pathogen, S. aureus can take advantage of the breach and establish a serious infection. When the opportunity arises to invade the respiratory tract, staphylococcal pneumonia can result. Opportunistic invasions are a major problem in hosts immunocompromised either by disease or by design. For example, patients on immunosuppressive therapy following a tissue transplant, or those whose immune systems have been destroyed by HIV, are vulnerable to infection by the opportunistic pathogens Pneumocystis carinii and Candida albicans.",

The lipopolysaccharides of the cell walls present in gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli are also powerful inducers of CXC chemokine secretion.

Many of the gram-positive cocci are pyogenic, meaning that they induce an acute, immunopathic inflammatory response accompanied by a high fever. In this situation, macrophages responding to the bacterium produce massive amounts of cytokines (particularly IL-1) that spill into the bloodstream and travel to the brain. The hypothalamus of the brain makes prostaglandins in response to these cytokines, and the prostaglandins act on the pituitary gland and influence it to raise the body's temperature.",

            "text": "The reader will recall from Chapter 20 that the relatively rare M cells of the FAE are key mediators of the antigen sampling necessary for mucosal immunity. Unfortunately, M cells are also inviting portals of entry for a variety of pathogens. The structure of the M cell is such that it lacks the protective glycocalyx of other mucosal epithelial cells, and forms a pocket that extends deep into the underlying lamina propria. Furthermore, the well-developed endocytic apparatus of the M cell is designed to expedite the passage of foreign material through the cell and into the dome underlying the pocket. Invasive species of bacteria and viruses have exploited this transport mechanism as an easy route to cross the otherwise resistant gut epithelium. Binding to M cells has been demonstrated for (among several other bacterial species) Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Vibrio cholerae, all of which cause enteric disease. (In contrast, the pathogenic strains of E. coli that cause similar symptoms attack gut enterocytes.) Only a few specific receptor-ligand pairs have been identified that exclusively facilitate bacterial entry through M cells. For example, the invasin proteins of Yersinia bind to \u24241 integrins on the M cell apical pole. Entry may be mediated more often by glycoproteins expressed on the apical surfaces of the M cells that can bind to particular bacterial adhesins. While some species of invading bacteria (e.g., Salmonella) are toxic to the M cells they have invaded, others are not. For example, V. cholerae does not cause disease until it reaches the small intestine, where it commences expression of proteins that allow it to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. Only then does the bacterium produce the cholera toxin that induces the exodus of chloride ions from the cell that leads to severe diarrhea.",

The bacteria induce the apoptosis of these cells, and with this apoptotic death comes the release of more Shigella that can invade neighboring epithelial cells, as well as a flood of IL-1\u2424 into the local area that induces inflammation.

In mice, reovirus entering the gut via the digestive tract is proteolytically modified by host digestive such that the virus is activated. This activation induces the expression of an (unidentified) protein that allows the virus to adhere to M cells in the intestinal PPs and the respiratory tract. The virus uses the pocket of the M cell to access the interior of the follicle and infect FAE cells from the basolateral side. Viral progeny then go on to infect the preferred targets of this virus, the macrophages and neurons in the dome underlying the FAE. Interestingly, DCs are not productively infected by reovirus. Rather, DCs capture viral antigens from apoptotic or necrotic epithelial cells and present them to mucosal T cells to initiate an immune response (refer to Ch.20). Another virus that exploits M cells in a variety of sites in mice is the retrovirus called mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Newborn mice may be infected with MMTV after consuming their infected mother's milk, and the virus then moves from the gut lumen to the M cells of the PPs. The virus spreads from there to the gut epithelial cells, the mesenteric lymph nodes and eventually to all lymphoid organs. In adult mice, MMTV enters the body via the M cells of the nasal or rectal epithelium. In humans, polio virus enters the body orally and passes through the M cells of the PPs on its way to its preferred target cells, the neuronal cells in the lamina propria. HIV is also thought to take advantage of M cells. HIV is frequently transmitted by anal intercourse but the virus cannot penetrate the glycocalyx of healthy rectal epithelial cells. Rather, the virus may enter the body via M cells present in FAE in the rectum, possibly by binding to galactosylceramine expressed on the M cell surface. Studies in rabbits and mice have confirmed that HIV can bind to M cells of the PPs and be transcytosed in vitro. Transportation through the M cell into its pocket would give ready access to the T cells, DCs, and macrophages that are this virus's primary targets. More on HIV appears in Chapter 25.",

A much more serious disease caused by either Staphylococcus aureus or group A streptococci alone, or by both in combination, is necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as \"flesh-eating disease.\" Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by the sudden onset of a rapidly spreading inflammatory infection that destroys the fascia, the layers of tissue covering the subcutaneous muscle layers. The skin and subcutaneous tissue become separated from the underlying muscles, and the patient experiences fever, severe pain, and a reddened swelling that spreads extremely quickly under the surface of the affected body part. Affected limbs may have to be amputated. Necrotizing fasciitis most often occurs in adults who have undergone surgery or experienced physical trauma of some sort, or who have compromised immune systems.

C. botulinum is an anaerobic bacterium that commonly resides in the form of dormant spores in soil, fresh water, and house dust, and on the surfaces of many foods. Upon introduction into a suitable low oxygen habitat, the bacterium resumes replication and production of the neurotoxin. Unfortunately, such an environment is sometimes provided by home-canned or home-preserved foods that did not receive adequate heat treatment. Within 8-36 hours after consuming food contaminated by even a minuscule amount of C. botulinum neurotoxin, the patient experiences blurred or double vision, slurred speech, swallowing and breathing difficulties, and muscle weakness due to paralysis of the muscle caused by the neurotoxin. Recovery may take weeks or months, and 7-8% of patients die.",

If left untreated, any type of anthrax can lead to septicemia and death. Cutaneous anthrax, the most common form, usually occurs after introduction into a skin abrasion of bacteria from contaminated meat, wool, hides, or leather of infected animals. Skin lesions develop within 12 days of exposure and become necrotic. Patients may also experience fever and lymph node swelling. Gastrointestinal anthrax occurs after consumption of raw or undercooked contaminated meat. Severe abdominal symptoms, including bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, occur within a week of exposure. Inhalation anthrax is contracted by breathing aerosolized spores of B. anthracis. It was originally thought that thousands of spores had to be inhaled to cause disease, but that number has been revised downward in light of the deaths of mail workers exposed to more modest bacterial loads. Within 7 days of exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis, symptoms resembling a viral respiratory illness ensue that rapidly progress to shock, respiratory failure, and sometimes meningitis.

            "text": "Many of the disease symptoms caused by extracellular bacteria can be attributed to their production of toxins. Exotoxins are toxic proteins actively secreted by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, while endotoxins are the lipid portion of lipopolysaccharides embedded in the walls of gram-negative bacteria. A given bacterial species may supply both exotoxins and endotoxins. For example, many strains of E. coli produce one or more exotoxins and contain the LPS endotoxin in their cell walls. Pseudomonas aeruginosa also contains LPS but secretes a different cytolytic exotoxin called exotoxin A. iia) Direct toxicity caused by exotoxins. Different exotoxins cause disease by different means and in different locations, depending on the proclivities of the individual bacterial species. For example, infection with V. cholerae results in the local release of an exotoxin that binds to gut epithelial cells. A massive release of electrolytes and tissue fluids is induced that is manifested as the severe diarrhea that characterizes cholera. Although they are derived from extracellular bacteria, many bacterial exotoxins have the ability to translocate into mammalian cells and wreak havoc on intracellular processes. The diphtheria exotoxin secreted by Corynebacterium diphtheriae travels the body systemically and is absorbed by cells of the heart and peripheral nervous system. The toxin inhibits protein synthesis in these cells, leading to myocarditis and neuritis. The diphtheria exotoxin also promotes colonization of the throat by the bacterium, which provokes an acute inflammatory response resulting in severe respiratory obstruction. As mentioned previously, C. botulinum produces a neurotoxin that blocks the transmission of nerve impulses to the muscles, resulting in paralysis. This toxin is much feared as a potential biological weapon because a dose of less than 1 g is fatal to humans. Another Clostridium species, Clostridium tetani, synthesizes a neurotoxin that causes uncontrollable muscle contractions. Other exotoxins trigger specific host cell necrosis, such as the leukocidin produced by S. aureus that is toxic to granulocytes. Another example is the exotoxin produced by E. coli O157:H7, which causes severe hemorrhaging because it blocks protein synthesis within vascular endothelial cells and kills them. B. anthracis produces two exotoxins called lethal toxin and edema toxin that damage phagocytes in an unknown way. Lethal toxin is composed of a zinc protease called lethal factor and a protein called protective antigen, while edema toxin is composed of an adenylate cyclase called edema factor plus protective antigen. iib) Immunopathic damage. Extracellular bacteria furnish many examples of situations in which the adaptive immune response to the infection results in immunopathic disease. In some cases, the destruction is caused by endotoxins, and in others an exotoxin is responsible. It is also becoming apparent that prolonged infection with many organisms can sometimes lead to the production of antibodies or activation of T cells that cross-react with self tissues, causing inflammation and possibly autoimmune disease. The concept of \"molecular mimicry,\" in which a pathogen antigen resembles a self antigen enough to provoke an attack on self tissues by anti-pathogen antibodies and T cells, is explored fully in Chapter 29.",

As described in Box 22-1, the cell wall of a gram-negative bacterium contains lipopolysaccharides composed of the endotoxin Lipid A and one of several O-linked polysaccharides (O-PS). Not only are the O-PS moieties often specific to a particular bacterial species but they are also immunogenic, leading to their designation as \"O-specific antigens.\" When the immune system responds to these antigens and destroys a gram-negative bacterium, its membrane disintegrates and Lipid A is released into the blood or gastrointestinal tract. The presence of Lipid A induces a massive release of cytokines (particularly TNF) that cause high fever and endotoxic shock (refer to Box 17-2). For example, in the case of Helicobacter pylori infection, Th1 cells responding to this organism produce large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines (principally TNF and IFN\u2425) that exacerbate the injury to the gastric lining and promote the formation of stomach ulcers.

Effective antitoxins are often of the IgG isotype because of the ability of this class to diffuse into the tissues. Antitoxins can also act as opsonins and enhance the clearance of the toxin by phagocytes. Sometimes secretory IgA can act as an antitoxin by preventing a toxin from making contact with and damaging a body tract such as the airway. If the toxin is the sole element causing disease in the host, the production of the antitoxin alone will be enough to restore health. For example, human resistance to tetanus relies on the presence of antibodies directed against the exotoxins produced by Clostridium tetani. The tetanus toxoid vaccination that we receive as infants (followed by tetanus boosters every 10 years) is a preparation of inactivated tetanus exotoxin that serves to induce and maintain the production of neutralizing antitoxin antibodies (see Ch.23). Not surprisingly, antigenic variation can influence antitoxin effectiveness. For example, the composition of a bacterial exotoxin may vary slightly among strains such that an antitoxin generated in an exposure to one strain may not recognize the epitopes of exotoxin produced by a later infection with a second strain.

Other particularly invasive or insidious extracellular pathogens, such as the spirochetes, provoke a combination of Th1 and Th2 responses. For example, immune responses to B. burgdorferi and T. pallidum have both humoral and inflammatory cell-mediated components. Even so, these organisms are difficult to eradicate, and development of a secondary response adequate to protect against re-infection develops only slowly, if at all. A clue to this intransigence may arise from the study of immune responses against Borrelia recurrentis, which causes recurring febrile episodes. Most of these bacteria are eliminated by the humoral response, but a few mutate just at the very end of the acute infection and escape immune system elimination.",

The capsule confers a charge and hydrophilic character to the bacterial surface that inhibits binding to phagocyte receptors. C3b may still attach to the bacterial surface, but the capsule sterically interferes with the binding of the phagocyte's receptors to the C3b. Instead, the host must synthesize opsonizing antibodies to allow a phagocyte to successfully attach to these invaders. Encapsulated bacteria therefore have more time (several days) than unencapsulated bacteria to reproduce undisturbed, making them more dangerous pathogens. For example, alveolar macrophages cannot engulf the encapsulated bacterium S. pneumoniae unless it is opsonized, allowing early establishment of the bacteria in the lungs. Eventually, antibodies to components of the capsule are made that facilitate destruction of the bacteria by complement-mediated lysis. However, if this tactic is not rapid enough, pneumonia can result. Those with deficits in the humoral response, such as the very young, the very old, and the immunocompromised, are especially susceptible to infections with encapsulated bacteria. To protect healthy adults at particular risk of exposure to these pathogens, a vaccine has been developed that contains the capsule components of several species (see Ch.23). A dangerous wrinkle in the capsule story is that some streptococci have capsules made of substances that are chemically identical to human components, such as hyaluronic acid. Antibodies raised against such substances might have the unwelcome collateral effect of promoting autoimmunity. Such considerations have mandated caution in vaccination against these pathogens.",

For example, enteropathogenic E. coli injects the Tir (translocation intimin receptor) protein into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. The act of injection induces a rearrangement of the host cell cytoskeleton that results in Tir being fixed in the plasma membrane, ready to act as a receptor for the surface protein intimin on the bacterium. Receptor-mediated endocytosis ensues, importing the bacterium into the non-phagocytic cell. Some species of Yersinia have direct anti-phagocyte activity. Y. enterocolitica is an extracellularly replicating enteric pathogen that targets the FAE of the PPs and causes severe diarrhea. This bacterium forestalls phagocytosis by attaching to the exterior of a looming macrophage and injecting a set of so-called Yop proteins into the macrophage cytoplasm. Among the Yop proteins is YopH, a phosphatase that binds to certain tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the macrophage that are thought to be involved in intracellular signaling and the operation of its actin cytoskeleton. When YopH dephosphorylates these host proteins, disruptions in intracellular signaling block integrin-mediated phagocytosis of the bacterium.

These sugars mask the LPS determinants that would normally bind to C3b and activate complement via the alternative pathway. Another avoidance mechanism is the shedding of activatory surface moieties or immune complexes, as occurs for the parasites Schistosoma mansoni and Trypanosoma cruzi, respectively. Some organisms express molecules that disrupt one or more complement activation pathways. For example, Protein H expressed by Streptococcus pyogenes binds to C1 but does not allow the cascade to proceed, competitively inhibiting the classical pathway. Several members of the poxvirus and herpesvirus families secrete proteins that block formation of the alternate C3 convertase. Even if either C3 or C1 has succeeded in initiating complement activation, many pathogens, such as the bacterium Escherichia coli and the parasite Leishmania major, respond by shedding the complex, particularly at the MAC formation stage. Proteolytic degradation and phosphorylation of complement components are also used by many organisms to derail MAC assembly before it can go too far.

L. monocytogenes causes meningeal or systemic infections most often in sheep and cattle but sometimes in humans.

The mycobacteria do not produce bacterial toxins and cause only mild inflammation on their own. However, these bacteria are extraordinarily hard to remove, and it is the prolonged host response to a mycobacterial infection that causes most of the tissue damage. Consider M. tuberculosis, a slow-replicating (12 hour) aerobic bacillus that gravitates to well-aerated tissues such as the lung. Tubercular disease associated with M. tuberculosis is caused not only by inflammatory damage in the lungs induced by the bacteria but also by the host's adaptive immune response. The persistence of the bacteria summons activated T cells that supply products and contacts that hyperactivate macrophages. The hyperactivated macrophages in turn secrete copious amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines that result in lung damage. In addition, the macrophages may eventually form granulomas to wall off the bacteria. These granulomas are the \"tubercles\" (lumps or knobs) on the lungs that give the disease its name. Eventually, the inner circle of macrophages in the tubercles breaks down and the bacilli are released. If the body's defenses can arrest the disease effectively at this point, the lesion calcifies and becomes visible in X-rays as scarring on the lung. If the disease is not arrested, the bacilli persist and may become dormant for months or even years. At some point, when the immune system is weakened due to poor health, malnutrition, or other infections, the bacilli in the center of the tubercle may be able to proliferate again. However, in this situation, bacterial multiplication takes place outside macrophages for the first time. Should the tubercles rupture, millions of bacteria are released into the lungs. The patient becomes highly contagious at this point due to the release of bacilli during coughing episodes. From the lungs, the bacteria disseminate throughout the patient's body and induce the formation of seed-sized tubercles in infected tissues. Body defenses may be overwhelmed, leading to the weight loss, coughing (often with blood), and loss of vigor known collectively as \"consumption.\"",

A classical \"TB test,\" involving the cutaneous injection of tuberculin antigen (often called purified protein derivative; PPD) into the skin, indicates whether an individual is or has been infected with M. tuberculosis (and thus may still be harboring the bacterium) (Plate 22-1). A pronounced, reddened reaction on the skin around the inoculation site after about 48 hours is a DTH response: memory T cells responding to the inoculated antigen activate macrophages that produce cytokines inciting local inflammation. In the very young, a positive TB test probably means that an active TB infection is occurring. In older people, a positive test can result from either an active infection, or from a previous infection that has been cleared, or from vaccination. In these cases, follow-up testing is done by X-ray examination of the lungs, which can distinguish between an active and a calcified lesion.

Attempts have been made to slow the spread of TB in such populations by antibiotic treatment and vaccination programs (see Ch.23).

However, if the infected patient mounts only a weak cell-mediated response to the organism, tuberculoid leprosy may become \"lepromatous leprosy.\" This form of the disease is characterized by severe skin lesions containing large numbers of bacteria that can destroy underlying bone and cartilage, leading to loss of structures such as the fingers and the nose. Anti-mycobacterial antibody titers are high in these patients but are ineffective in controlling the disease.",

These antibodies intercept any bacterium temporarily transiting the extracellular environment. proteins that scientists are only now beginning to investigate. For example, mice that have a mutation of a gene called Nramp1 (natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1) have an increased susceptibility to BCG infections. Upon phagocytosis of a microbe during the innate response, the wild-type Nramp1 protein is recruited to the membrane of the macrophage phagosome and integrates within it. It is thought that the presence of Nramp1 in the phagolysosomal membrane somehow influences the microenvironment within the phagolysosome and hence its killing ability. Human homologues of Nramp1 have been found in neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages. Another group of proteins important for the killing of intracellular pathogens (at least in mice) are the p47GTPases, a family of GTP-hydrolyzing proteins of 47-48 kDa. These transmembrane enzymes, whose expression is greatly upregulated in response to IFNs and LPS, are thought to be localized in either the ER or the Golgi. Functionally, the p47GTPases appear to regulate the maturation and processing of pathogen-containing phagosomes, hastening the demise of the invader. Interestingly, different members of the p47GTPase family are required for effective resistance to different classes of intracellular pathogens. Studies of knockout mice have shown that, while the p47GTPase Igtp is required for normal resistance to the protozoan parasite Leishmania major, it does not play a crucial role in defense against the intracellular bacteria L. monocytogenes or M. tuberculosis. In contrast, knockout mice lacking the p47GTPase Lrg47 are highly susceptible to infection with L. monocytogenes, S. typhimurium, or M. tuberculosis as well as L. major.",

As well, components derived from the degradation of a phagocytosed bacterium or antigens secreted by it can be released into the cytosol, allowing peptides from these molecules to be cross-presented on MHC class I. Such cells function as target cells for Tc in the local lymph node or memory CTLs in the periphery. For example, studies of L. monocytogenes have demonstrated that CD8 \u03e9 CTLs are crucial for resolving infections with this pathogen. Mice deficient for either \u2423\u2424 TCR components or \u24242m (and thus MHC class I) show decreased resistance to L. monocytogenes infection. Similarly, mice that are normally resistant to tuberculosis can be rendered susceptible if CD8 \u03e9 T cells are depleted by treatment with antibodies prior to infection. However, cytolysis via the perforin or Fas pathways does not appear to be a big factor in CD8 \u03e9 T cell-mediated defense against intracellular bacteria (unlike antiviral defense; see later). Studies in knockout mice have shown that Fas-mediated cytolysis is not required for any stage of host defense against L. monocytogenes or M. tuberculosis, and perforin-mediated cytotoxicity is important only for containing disease in the chronic stages of L. monocytogenes and M. tuberculosis infections. Rather, CD8 \u03e9 CTLs contribute to anti-bacterial defense primarily by releasing IFN\u2425 and TNF, which are critical both for inflammatory cell influx and direct killing of infected cells, and by secreting granulysin, a molecule that has direct anti-microbial I M M U N IT Y TO PATHOG E N S 22 activity.

This protein normally has a role in early development and morphogenesis, but in this case acts as a receptor for M. leprae. The microbe enters the Schwann cells and is protected from phagocytosis. Similarly, L. monocytogenes expresses internalin proteins that bind to the host adhesion molecule E-cadherin, allowing the bacteria to enter non-phagocytes. L. monocytogenes also deliberately accesses phagocytes using the host cell Fc and complement receptors, but then employs survival tactics to prevent killing within the phagosome. These tactics include the synthesis of the listeriolysin O protein mentioned previously. LLO induces pore formation in the membrane of the phagolysosome, allowing the bacterium to escape into the relative safety of the cytoplasm. M. tuberculosis has devised several different ways of avoiding phagolysosomal destruction. First, when this bacterium finds itself being engulfed in a macrophage phagosome, it recruits a host protein called TACO (tryptophan-aspartatecontaining coat protein) to the cytoplasmic surface of the developing phagosome. The presence of TACO inhibits the fusion of the phagosome with lysosomes and other vesicles containing hydrolytic enzymes and specialized killing components. Secondly, mycobacteria also produce NH 4 \u03e9 , which reverses the acidification of phagolysosomes and promotes fusion with harmless endosomes. Thirdly, M. tuberculosis infection of macrophages interferes with STAT1-mediated transcriptional responses to IFN\u2425 signaling, blocking the expression of genes needed for microbicidal action and hyperactivation. As a result of these three strategies, mycobacteria can survive within host phagosomes for long periods.

However, unlike bacteria, viruses consist only of DNA or RNA genomes packaged in proteinaceous capsids. Viruses therefore do not have their own protein synthesis machinery and rely on subverting that of the host cell. The genomes of viruses are much smaller than those of other classes of pathogens, being limited to about 100 genes at most; the smallest viruses make do with four genes. Most of the genes in a virus genome encode structural proteins or are required for viral replication, but a surprisingly large number of genes in the more complex viruses encode proteins that undermine the host immune response or regulate host cell apoptosis. Many of these genes are dispensable for viral replication in vitro, emphasizing their function as countermeasures to the host immune response in vivo. Viruses with a small genome count on rapid replication and dissemination to new host cells to establish an infection before the immune system can respond. Viruses with larger genomes need more time to replicate and are transmitted more slowly; accordingly, these organisms have developed ways of interfering with various components of the host immune response that allow sufficient time for the establishment of an infection.",

Progeny virions released into the local area can infect neighboring host cells and initiate new replicative cycles that facilitate widespread dissemination of the virus. Progeny virions that reach the blood circulation are free to spread systemically. Different viruses have different relationships with their hosts. Viruses may vary with respect to the species they can infect (host range), the kinetics of their replication, and their propensity to cause either acute or chronic disease. Naturally, a successful virus is not so virulent that it wipes out all members of its target species, since that would prevent the virus's own future replication. Viruses that damage the host cell during infection are said to be cytopathic, while those that merely take over cell functions without damaging the host cell are non-cytopathic. In addition to virally induced cytopathy, it is not unusual for the host's own immune response to the virus to result in immunopathic damage to host tissues.",

            "text": "After an initial infection, some types of viruses remain in the body and establish a persistent infection. Unlike bacteria and parasites, which often give rise to chronic disease in cases of persistent infection, most viruses that persist in the body do so in a latent state. During latency, viral activity is held in check by cell-mediated immunity. The host experiences no symptoms and the virus remains in a non-infectious mode in which no new virus particles are assembled. However, as the host ages or faces immune system challenges such as other infectious agents, cancer, or immunosuppressive drug treatments, the cell-mediated response weakens. This weakening increases the likelihood that the latent virus will become reactivated, leading to recommencement of a productive infection with associated symptoms. A common example of this type of latent viral infection occurs with the virus that causes chicken pox, varicella zoster virus (VZV; also known as human herpesvirus 3, or herpes zoster). After an initial infection that results in the characteristic chicken pox rash, the virus moves up to the dorsal root ganglia of sensory nerves that reach into the skin and becomes latent, usually for years. Upon reactivation, the viral infection spreads down the affected nerves to the skin, causing the formation of vesicles called \"shingles\" that are very painful to the host and are teeming with infectious virus particles. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) acts in a similar way on nerves supplying the mouth area, giving rise to cold sores after a period of latency. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) persists in a latent infection that causes no symptoms and is not infectious as long as cell-mediated responses are intact and ongoing. If the virus becomes reactivated, patients may come down with pneumonitis or hepatitis and may shed infectious virus in their urine.",

            "text": "The oncogenic viruses are an important group of latent viruses. Both DNA and RNA viruses are represented in this heterogeneous group, their common characteristic being an association with malignancy in a small percentage of hosts. Infection with these viruses is usually inconsequential to everyday health, but, in some individuals, the replication of these pathogens disturbs the host cell cycle in such a way that the cell is transformed and becomes cancerous. The DNA oncogenic viruses include human papillomavirus (HPV; cervical cancer), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal cancer), and hepatitis B virus (HepB; liver cancer). The RNA oncogenic viruses are all retroviruses, meaning that they possess a reverse transcriptase enzyme that allows them to make a cDNA copy of their RNA genome that can integrate into the host cell DNA. In humans, the retrovirus human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) causes T cell leukemias and lymphomas (see Ch.30). The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS, is also a retrovirus (see Ch.25). HIV-infected individuals have a higher incidence of various lymphomas (see Ch.30). More on oncogenic viruses and immune responses to them appears in Chapter 26. Adenovirus is one of the best-studied pathogens at the molecular level. The virus first expresses E1A genes that force the infected host epithelial cell to enter S phase. The viral DNA then replicates after about 7 hours. Various E1B, E2, E3, and E4 transcription units are subsequently activated that supply structural proteins for the virus and other proteins that control host cell functions and viral resistance to the immune response. Virions are assembled within 24 hours and are released from the lysed host cell by 48-72 hours. iib) Cytomegalovirus. Cytomegaloviruses are \u2424-herpesviruses, meaning that they are large, double-stranded DNA viruses. Human CMV is endemic in all human populations but causes only sub-clinical infections in immunocompetent hosts due to control by CD8 \u03e9 T cells. However, in immunocompromised hosts, such as fetuses, AIDS patients, and transplant recipients (who may acquire CMV from their transplants), the active virus can cause severe or even fatal disease. About 10-15% of CMV-infected fetuses suffer brain damage, while infected adults may come down with pneumonia, hepatitis, nephritis, iid) Hepatitis B virus. The hepatitis B virus is an enveloped DNA virus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. Clinical symptoms of HepB infection include jaundice, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and pain in the abdomen and joints. HepB infections may be either acute or chronic. Transmission is primarily by sexual contact or via contaminated needles used to inject intravenous drugs, although body fluids such as saliva and breast milk can be infectious as well. About 30% of acute infections are asymptomatic. When the virus adopts a latent state in which the viral genome integrates into the host genome, a chronic HepB infection is established and these persons become HepB carriers (who may or may not show symptoms). Chronic HepB infections may eventually lead to more serious conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver and hepatic cancer. The propensity for HepB infection to become chronic is greatest in the very young. That is, in 90% of individuals who are infected with the HepB virus when under the age of 1 year, the infection becomes chronic. In contrast, only 5% of those who are infected when over the age of 5 years continue to harbor the virus latently. The WHO estimates that, worldwide, 1.2 billion people are infected with HepB, and 350 million of these infections are chronic. About 15-25% of chronically infected persons die of HepB-related disease each year. iie) Hepatitis C virus. The hepatitis C virus is a small, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus with effects very similar to those of HepB, except that the infection becomes chronic at a much higher rate: fully 80% of all individuals infected are unable to clear the virus. The major mode of HepC transmission is via exposure to contaminated blood, either through blood transfusion (see Box 25-1 in Ch.25) or the sharing of contaminated needles. It remains controversial whether HepC is also transmissible through sexual contact. Worldwide, at least 3-4 million new HepC infections occur each year, and an estimated 3% of the world's population is currently infected. Of those chronically infected, 10-20% go on to develop cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer, and an estimated 0.4% of these die each year. In the United States, chronic liver disease is the 10th leading cause of death among adults, and studies suggest that 40% of all such cases are due to HepC infection. In developed countries, chronic HepC infection is the most common reason for liver transplants.",

Most individuals attacked by HepC mount humoral and cell-mediated responses against the virus, but these responses are not usually sufficient to clear it. Moreover, HepC exhibits considerable genetic heterogeneity, with six major genotypes and over 100 strains. The envelope proteins of different HepC strains can diverge by as much as 50%, such that neutralizing antibodies that are effective against one strain may not be effective against another strain. More on the difficulties of dealing with HepC appears in Chapter 23. iif) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The influenza virus is an enveloped RNA virus with a segmented genome. As most of us know from personal experience, the \"flu\" is a nasty respiratory infection that initiates in ciliated epithelial cells but eventually produces symptoms that affect the entire body. Much of the malaise associated with the flu can be attributed to the large quantities of IFN\u2423 produced by immune system cells fighting the infection. Headaches, chills, high fever, muscle aches, weakness, and dry cough are common symptoms, most of which are resolved within 2 weeks. However, the virus abrogates the normal function of the ciliated epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, decreasing the expulsion of pathogens in the mucus. Macrophage and neutrophil functions may also be suppressed in the local area of infection. As a result, opportunistic bacteria may become established in the respiratory tract and go on to cause potentially fatal pneumonia.",

Because the principal proteins of these strains differ slightly (another example of antigenic variation), an immune response mounted against one strain does not guarantee protection against another strain. Thankfully, neither chronic nor latent infections occur with influenza virus. Influenza virus has been responsible in the past for several hemispheric and global epidemics in which the elderly and the immunocompromised were killed in large numbers. Even today, influenza virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly among the aged and chronically ill. On a global scale, it is estimated that the annual bout of influenza infection causes 3-5 million cases of severe disease and 250,000-500,000 deaths. iih) Measles virus. The measles virus is a cytopathic, enveloped RNA virus that initially attacks the upper respiratory tract but then spreads via the lymphatics and blood circulation to most other tissues. The characteristic red \"measles spots\" that appear all over the body are due to cell-mediated immune responses against infected host cells. Acute measles infections are highly contagious and the virus is easily spread to new hosts through respiratory secretions. Moreover, measles virus can survive for at least 60 minutes in aerosolized droplets, allowing it to spread through ventilation systems. Globally, an estimated 40 million new measles infections occur each year.",

            "text": "At the cellular level, the virus primarily targets monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and DCs by binding to a membrane glycoprotein called SLAM (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule; CD150). However, the measles virus can also penetrate the walls of cerebral capillaries and enter the CNS, where it infects neurons. Due to the loss of function of multiple types of immune system cells, measles I M M U N IT Y TO PATHOG E N S 22 patients experience profound immunosuppression that makes them highly susceptible to secondary infections that may be severe or even fatal. In unvaccinated individuals, the disease can have significant mortality: 1-2 million deaths due to measles occur worldwide each year. While most survivors enjoy lifelong immunity to this virus, they are not entirely without risk. Some variant strains of the measles virus have defects in their surface proteins that block expression of viral antigens on the infected host cell surface, meaning that these cells escape the immune response. In a small percentage of individuals, these variants persistently infect the CNS and cause a chronic, progressive neurological disease called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). More on the measles virus appears in Chapter 23. iii) Polio virus. Polio virus is a small, non-enveloped RNA virus that replicates first in the intestinal tract. The virus is shed into the feces of an infected individual and spreads to new hosts via feces-contaminated food or water. In the later stages of an infection, the virus moves to the blood and spreads to the spinal cord and CNS. While most infected individuals recover completely, in a small number of patients the virus causes poliomyelitis, permanent muscle paralysis due to the destruction of the motor nerves of the CNS. In fact, in the pre-vaccine era, poliomyelitis was the leading cause of permanent disability in the United States. The disease was called \"infantile paralysis\" at that time because of the large number of children affected. When viral destruction of brain stem cells resulted in paralysis of the respiratory muscles, the patient had to be placed in an \"iron lung\" (artificial breathing apparatus). Even today, polio virus infection is fatal in 2-5% of poliomyelitic children and in 15-30% of adults. In aging survivors, the neurological damage suffered during an acute infection may be manifested as \"post-polio fatigue,\" similar in symptoms to chronic fatigue syndrome. Polio is now almost unknown in the Americas, Europe, and the Antipodes due to a very successful vaccination campaign (see Ch.23), although it continues to plague some populations in Asia and Africa. iij) Rabies virus. Rabies is a disease characterized by hyperexcitability and spasms of the mouth and pharynx that occur when swallowing liquids. This latter feature can sometimes lead to \"foaming at the mouth\" and/or a fear of water (\"hydrophobia\"). The disease is caused by the rabies virus, an enveloped RNA virus. Upon entering the body, the virus replicates first in skeletal muscle and connective tissue. It then enters and spreads along the peripheral nerves to the spinal cord and CNS, where it eventually causes encephalitis. Initial symptoms are slow to develop, and may include irritability, fever, pain, and fatigue that can progress to hallucination and paralysis. The rabies virus readily infects cats, dogs, raccoons, foxes, bats, and skunks, all of which are creatures that interact quite frequently with humans. The bite of a rabid animal is usually fatal for humans unless a course of injections of protective anti-rabies antibodies is undertaken immediately (see Ch.23). The virus replicates in slow waves, meaning that the passive supply of relatively short-lived antibodies must be replenished several times to ensure elimination of the virus. iik) Rhinovirus. Rhinovirus (rhino, \"nose\") is a nonenveloped, single-stranded RNA virus and a member of the picornavirus family. Over 100 rhinoviruses are known. About 50% of common colds are caused by some kind of rhinovirus. (About 10% of common colds are due to infection with a different type of virus, such as adenovirus, while the cause in 40% of cases is unknown.) Rhinoviruses thrive in the upper respiratory tract, particularly the nose and throat. The infection is thus characterized by the familiar symptoms of sneezing, excessive nasal secretion (\"runny nose\"), and congestion (\"stuffy nose\"). Complications of rhinovirus infection include spreading of the virus from the throat to the sinuses, lower respiratory tract, and middle ear, resulting in sinusitis, laryngitis, and otitis media, respectively. iil) SARS virus. The virus that causes SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) is a novel member of the coronavirus family. Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses with an asymmetric shape and surface spikes positioned so as to resemble a crown. Most human coronaviruses are associated with only mild respiratory disease. Thus, the world was caught off-guard in early 2003 by the severity of the atypical pneumonia caused by the newly emerged SARS coronavirus. Over 8000 cases of infection leading to more than 700 deaths were recorded in this initial outbreak. Scientists speculate that the SARS virus may have arisen in a sudden species jump from healthy civet cats to their owners in China in late 2002.",

Damage to the alveoli of the lungs is progressive and can be fatal. The virus spreads between humans by close contact, such as touching a contaminated surface or breathing in aerosol droplets created by the coughing or sneezing of an infected individual. At the cellular level, the SARS virus replicates chiefly in respiratory epithelial cells, although other tissues (such as eyes, heart, liver, kidney) and other cell types (such as macrophages) may also be targeted. Unlike most coronaviruses, the cytopathic SARS virus can be cultured in vitro, aiding the study of its infection mechanisms. iim) Smallpox virus. The smallpox virus (variola) was introduced in Chapter 1. Although this virus has been eliminated globally in the wild, in this age of bioterrorism, it behooves us to briefly comment on it. Variola is a highly infectious member of the DNA poxvirus family. Smallpox disease is characterized by pain, fever, and a severe blistering of the skin that leaves disfiguring marks, particularly on the face of the infected individual (refer to Plate 1-1). Smallpox infection is fatal in 30% of cases. There is controversy over whether stocks of variola should be maintained for vaccine development. More on this issue appears in Chapter 23. iin) Vaccinia virus. As recounted in Chapter 1, Jenner used the cowpox virus to vaccinate against smallpox back in the late 1700s. In modern times, the vaccinia virus is used. Vaccinia is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus and a member of the poxvirus family that includes cowpox and variola (smallpox). Curiously, it is not clear how the vaccinia I M M U N IT Y TO PATHOG E N S 22 virus arose. Some researchers have speculated that early attempts at developing a better smallpox vaccine resulted in a recombination of cowpox virus with another poxvirus that resulted in the vaccinia virus. While vaccinia does replicate in human cells, it usually causes relatively mild illness (rash, low fever, enlarged lymph nodes, papule at the site of vaccination) and is only very occasionally fatal. As described in more detail in Chapter 23, vaccinia is under intense investigation as a vector for DNA vaccines.",

Antibody defense, particularly neutralization, is crucial for protection against re-infection with many viruses. We also remind the reader that members of the TLR family of PRRs play a key role in both the innate and adaptive antiviral responses. TLR9 recognizes CpG-containing viral DNA, while TLR3 binds to double-stranded viral RNA, and TLR7 and TLR8 are triggered by single-stranded GU-rich viral RNA. TLR-stimulated macrophages and DCs produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN\u2423, IL-6, TNF, and IL-12. In the presence of these cytokines, TLR-stimulated DCs acquire viral components and are induced to mature, becoming competent APCs able to present viral antigens to naive T cells.

As we learned in Chapter 17, the type I interferons were first discovered on the basis of their antiviral activities. Host cells infected with a virus produce IFN\u2423 and IFN\u2424, which in turn initiate a series of metabolic events in neighboring cells that result in their adopting an antiviral state. The reader will recall from Chapter 17 that IFN\u2423 and IFN\u2424 induce the synthesis of the host enzyme PKR, which is inactive until it encounters a dsRNA molecule such as a viral genome. Among other substrates, activated PKR phosphorylates first itself and then eIF2, a factor necessary for translation of both host and viral proteins. Since the virus relies on the host cell's translation machinery for viral protein synthesis, viral reproduction is halted. IFNs also induce expression of 2-5A synthetase, an enzyme activated by dsRNA that generates short 2\u0408,5\u0408 oligoadenonucleotides. These 2-5A molecules activate RNAse L, which degrades both viral and cellular RNAs, again blocking translation. Surprisingly, mice deficient for PKR are capable of mounting effective immune responses to almost all viruses (except vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV), suggesting that redundancy for PKR function or a parallel antiviral pathway exists.

It seems that, unlike the case for any other cell type, low levels of viruses infecting hepatocytes are controlled solely by cytokine action that does not lead to cytolysis. For example, LCMV and mouse CMV are cleared from murine liver cells primarily by the action of CTL-synthesized IFN\u2425, in sharp contrast to the cytolytic elimination of these viruses in other cell types. In a poorly defined mechanism, the binding of IFN\u2425 to its receptor on an infected hepatocyte activates intracellular degradation of viral components, curing the cell without killing it. In the case of hepatocytes infected with HepB virus, both TNF and IFN\u2425 must I M M U N IT Y TO PATHOG E N S 22 (2) IFN\u2423/\u2424 also activates macrophage killing and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO. (3) IL-12 produced by macrophages activates NK cells that secrete additional cytokines and use natural cytotoxicity to kill infected host cells that fail to express MHC class I. (4) Infected APCs present viral peptides to CD4 \u03e9 T cells that supply CD40L contacts required for licensing APCs. The CD4 \u03e9 T cells are activated by this encounter and generate Th1 effectors that supply cytokine help to Tc cells and B cells. Antiviral neutralizing antibodies block further spread of the virus, and antiviral CTLs secrete cytotoxic molecules and kill virus-infected host cells by Fas killing or perforin/granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity. (5) DCs infected by a \"strong\" virus upregulate their costimulatory molecules even in the absence of CD40 ligation, and activate Tc cells in absence of Th help. (6) Antibodies bound to a viral antigen on the surface of an infected host cell may engage the FcR on an NK cell, macrophage, or neutrophil and trigger ADCC or opsonized phagocytosis by these cells. Alternatively, the bound antibody may be bound by free C3b, facilitating opsonized phagocytosis of the infected cell. If the bound antibody binds C1, classical complement activation can lead to MAC-mediated destruction of the infected cell. (7) Complement may also be activated by the binding of C1, C3b, or MBL to the virus itself (as opposed to the infected host cell). bind to their respective receptors on the hepatocyte surface to induce selective degradation of the viral genome as the virus replicates within the hepatocyte. Again, the threat is removed without killing the liver cell. Liver cells are killed when viral loads are high, because the heightened inflammatory response sparked by large numbers of virus particles recruits activated macrophages. In the cytokine-rich milieu of the inflamed liver, the macrophages commence expression of CD40L, which engages CD40 expressed on hepatocytes. This interaction induces FasL expression on hepatocytes, making them vulnerable to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Should FasL be engaged either by Fas on the surface of the same hepatocyte, or on an adjacent hepatocyte, cell death is induced, which can eventually lead to clinical liver damage. This type of liver pathology is prominent in severe cases of HepB and HepC infection in humans.",

In about 3% of carriers, the virus causes the adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia that gives this virus its name (see Ch.30). However, another 2.5% of carriers develop a chronic neurological disease called HAM/TSP (HTLV-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis). The principal clinical feature of HAM/TSP is chronic inflammation of the spinal cord. It has been postulated that those individuals who mount a particularly strong CTL response restrict HTLV-1 spreading very efficiently, reducing the concentration of viral antigens that might otherwise induce inflammation. In an individual mounting a less effective CTL response, viral antigens are allowed to accumulate. A continuous cell-mediated response is stimulated that is accompanied by large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines that result in inflammation and damage within the CNS of the patient.",

In other words, the DCs become fully mature APCs able to activate CD8 \u03e9 T cells directly, without the need for help (CD40L engagement) from CD4 \u03e9 T cells. A similar scenario holds for LCMV infection in mice.

Viruses such as VSV, LCMV, and Coxsackie virus have highly repetitive antigenic Ti structures on their surfaces that can activate virus-specific B cells without T cell help. Limited isotype switching may even occur in response to these antigens.

            "text": "A virus that can adopt a latent state escapes the attention of the immune response, at least temporarily. Many viruses have the ability to persist and even multiply in cells in a defective form that renders them non-infectious for a period of time. The virus then waits until conditions in the host, such as drug-induced immunosuppression or immunodeficiency associated with disease or aging, provide better odds of survival and transmission to new hosts. In most cases, latency involves the inactivation of viral gene transcription needed for productive infection and the subsequent expression of new viral latency-associated transcripts (LATs). Reversal from latency back to productive infection requires some type of reactivation of the productive infection genes that can only occur when the immune response is weakened. Different viruses achieve latency in different ways. The retroviruses, like HIV, become latent by integrating a cDNA copy of their RNA genome into the DNA of a host cell in such a way that there is limited transcription of viral genes (see Ch.25). The herpesviruses, which are large, double-stranded DNA viruses with genomes encoding numerous viral proteins, rely on other means of transcriptional control. For example, both VZV and HSV are herpesviruses that can establish latent infections in the neuronal ganglia. Neurons express little or no MHC class I and so are relatively safe havens to which these viruses can retreat. The viral genome persists in only 0.01% of the neuron population but does not integrate into the host DNA. Rather, the viral genome forms a complex with host nucleosomal proteins that blocks transcription of productive infection genes. A new set of LATs is then transcribed to maintain latency. Another important human viral pathogen that adopts latency is CMV. Latent CMV takes up residence in leukocytes and endothelial cells concentrated around the kidneys, heart, and liver. It is not yet clear whether the CMV are herpesviruses whose latency is associated with the development of host tumors. As mentioned previously, EBV infection is linked with B cell lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinomas, while KSHV appears to cause the Kaposi's sarcoma often found in AIDS patients. Unlike the oncogenic retroviruses, however, the genomes of these oncogenic DNA viruses do not integrate into the host DNA. Productive infection is halted via downregulation of productive infection genes and subsequent upregulation of LATs. For example, EBV latency correlates with the downregulation of the EBNA3 family of viral antigens. It is these proteins that normally supply immunodominant peptides for EBV-specific CTLs. The virus then upregulates expression of EBNA1 (EBV nuclear antigen-1), a protein essential for EBV latency. However, as is described in more detail later, the structure of the EBNA-1 protein blocks its presentation on MHC class I molecules, obscuring the virus from CTL recognition.",

Minor mutations to the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins present on the surface of the influenza virion arise at a rate of about 1 in 10 6 virus particles. These minor variants often replicate preferentially in the host, as they cannot be neutralized by existing antibodies raised against earlier strains. New strains of influenza arising due to continual antigenic drift spread fairly quickly through a population and are responsible for localized influenza outbreaks. A similar form of antigenic drift can be observed in human rhinoviruses as well as in foot-and-mouth disease virus.

With such a genetic structure, two different influenza strains that simultaneously infect a single host cell can undergo a reassortment (sometimes inaccurately called \"recombination\") of their genomic segments (Fig. 22-6) . Virus particles containing new combinations of parental RNA suddenly arise, dramatically changing the spectrum of protein epitopes presented to the immune system. Another factor favoring antigenic shift is the ability of many strains of influenza virus to infect an intermediate host (such as a pig or chicken) before being passed on to humans. These animal hosts are known as animal reservoirs. Reassortment of gene segments can also occur in an animal reservoir, again leading to new combinations of proteins expressed in the progeny viruses.

One of the easiest ways to block MHC class II presentation is to avoid getting antigens into professional APCs. For example, the rabies virus preferentially infects neurons and is very slow to replicate and lyse these cells, meaning that viral antigens are not easily collected by APCs until quite some time after the virus has entered the body. The natural immune response to rabies is thus considerably delayed. Interestingly, because the virus replicates relatively slowly, an individual bitten by a rabid animal can be successfully treated with a post-exposure vaccine, as an alternative to the administration of anti-rabies antibodies. The rabies vaccine contains an inactivated form of the virus that is injected directly into regions of the body where APCs are present, rapidly inducing an immune response (see Ch.23). Effectors activated by these APCs may then take steps to eliminate the rabies-infected neurons before the virus can spread further. Other viruses take more indirect approaches to inhibiting MHC class II antigen presentation (Fig. 22-9 ). When a virus infects a cell, it produces IFNs that act on neighboring cells to induce the expression of many genes, among them MHC class II. As we learned in Chapters 10 and 17, IFN\u2425 transduces its signals through the Jak-STAT pathway, activating the transcription factor CIITA required for MHC class II expression. The IE/E protein of human CMV is produced early during infection and blocks IFN\u2425 signaling by destabilizing the Jak molecule, resulting in failed CIITA activation and thus reduced MHC class II expression. Proteins from adenovirus (e.g., E1A) can also affect MHC class II expression by influencing intracellular levels of activated Jak and STAT.",

Many viruses have sought to manipulate host cell apoptosis by either altering intracellular levels of host Bcl-2 or expressing Bcl-2 homologues. For example, herpesvirus samurai (HVS) expresses a homologue of Bcl-2 called ORF-16 that blocks mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Two other examples can be found during EBV infection. In its productive infection phase, EBV expresses a Bcl-2 homologue called BHFR1 that blocks apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli. However, during its latent phase, EBV expresses the LMP-1 protein instead. This molecule, which closely resembles a constitutively active CD40 Infected host cell molecule, is anti-apoptotic because it upregulates intracellular levels of host Bcl-2 and stimulates the activities of the host transcription factors NF-B and AP-1; these transcription factors promote cell survival. This persistent stimulation by LMP-1 is thought to drive abnormal B cell survival and proliferation to the point of malignant transformation. A fourth example is the E1B-19K protein of adenovirus.

When the gametocytes reach the mid-gut of the mosquito, they commence maturation and 24 hours later combine to form worm-like zygotes that mature into ookinetes. Each ookinete penetrates into the mosquito's mid-gut wall, forms an oocyst, and starts to produce progeny called sporozoites within it. When an oocyst bursts, the sporozoites are released and migrate to the mosquito's salivary glands. When the infected mosquito bites a human, 5-20 sporozoites are injected into his or her subcutaneous tissues. Within minutes of injection, the sporozoites race through the blood to the liver and invade hepatocytes. In these cells, the sporozoites replicate asexually (and asymptomatically) for 2-10 days, producing thousands of merozoite progeny. The infected hepatocytes then lyse, each releasing 10,000-30,000 merozoites into the bloodstream where they invade erythrocytes and express parasite proteins on the RBC surface. Within the erythrocytes, the merozoites mature into schizonts that reproduce asexually and exponentially. The RBCs lyse 48 hours later, releasing new progeny merozoites into the blood, where they attack more erythrocytes. This synchronized rupture of the erythrocytes is felt as the cyclical constellation of chills, fever, and sweating that constitutes clinical malaria. These symptoms are due to the release of TNF and IL-1 by macrophages responding to the presence of lysed RBCs. However, not all RBCs are lysed by the merozoites. Within some infected RBCs, the merozoites develop into the sexual male and female gametocyte forms. These gametocytes can persist for years in the host. The cycle repeats when another mosquito bites the infected human and takes up RBCs infected with gametocytes.",

The sickle cell mutation occurs most frequently in Africa, where the advantage it confers over malaria has resulted in its selection despite its associated anemia.

The parasite causes no illness in the infected cat, but when the parasite enters its sexual stage in the feline intestine, oocysts containing sporozoites are formed that are then shed into the feces. These feces may then contaminate food, water, or soil consumed or handled by other animals or humans. If a mouse drinks water contaminated with T. gondii oocysts and an uninfected cat eats that mouse, the cycle repeats in the new host. If an oocyst is ingested by a human, the sporozoites are released from the oocyst and travel through the blood and lymph to various tissues, causing infections of the eye, muscle, and brain. In healthy adult humans, the symptoms of T. gondii infection are usually mild and resemble mononucleosis at worst. However, in immunocompromised individuals (such as AIDS patients), sporozoites reaching the brain or eye can cause cerebral abscesses and neurological damage or retinitis leading to visual impairment. Pregnant women face the greatest danger from T. gondii infection (which is why mothers-to-be are warned not to change the litter boxes of their pet cats). Infection during pregnancy can cause severe brain damage or vision problems in the fetus or even stillbirth. T. brucei is a flagellated protozoan parasite that uses the blood-sucking tsetse fly as a vector. Both humans and cattle can be bitten by the tsetse fly and thus be infected, causing devastation on two fronts in African villages. In the first stage of a human infection (which can extend for months or even years), the trypanosomes replicate freely in the blood and cause limited disease. Symptoms include fever, headaches, joint pain, and itchiness. However, in the second stage of the human disease, the parasite crosses the blood-brain barrier and attacks elements of the CNS. Victims show confusion, loss of appetite, lethargy, poor coordination, tissue wasting, and severe disruption of the sleep cycle (hence the name, African \"sleeping sickness\"). The disease is fatal without treatment, and irreversible neurological damage can occur if treatment is not started before the onset of the second stage. T. brucei can also cross the placenta and kill the developing fetus of an infected pregnant woman. ",

T. cruzi, which is carried by small blood-sucking insects called triatomines, is endemic in the southern United States, Central America, and South America. It is estimated that more than 20 million individuals are infected with T. cruzi, and that this parasite causes 50,000 deaths each year. The disease course has three stages: acute, indeterminate, and chronic. Only 1% of newly infected individuals show symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and a distinctive swelling at the site where the triatomine accessed the body. In most individuals, these difficulties are resolved without treatment. However, if T. cruzi is not completely cleared, the infection enters an indeterminate stage that can prevail for decades. The patient remains asymptomatic because the infection is kept under control by effective antiparasite cell-mediated and humoral Th1 immune responses. About one-third of Chagas' disease patients go on to the chronic stage of the disease, in which much more serious symptoms appear 10-40 years after the initial infection. These patients exhibit a life-threatening inflammatory cardiomyopathy characterized by the infiltration of CD8 \u03e9 T cells and macrophages and the presence of DTH lesions. The esophagus and colon also become enlarged. Interestingly, T. cruzi itself is not found in high numbers in the affected organs, leading some researchers to suspect that the symptoms of chronic stage Chagas' disease may be autoimmune in origin. That is, high levels of parasites present at the acute stage of the infection prime the immune system to cause damage to self tissues many years later (see Ch.29). Indeed, healthy mice that receive isolated CD4 \u03e9 T cells from mice chronically infected with T. cruzi soon show myocardial pathology.",

Although most protozoan parasites adopt intracellular habitats for at least some of their life cycle, humoral immune responses to these organisms do occur. All the effector mechanisms ascribed to antibodies for defense against extracellular bacteria (refer to Fig. 22 -2) apply to defense against small extracellular parasites. Both natural and antigen-specific antibodies may act as opsonins for the extracellular stage of protozoans which, unlike the helminths, are small enough to be phagocytosed. As well, ADCC, classical activation of the complement cascade, and neutralization have all been described as effective means of eliminating these organisms. For example, high titers of neutralizing antibodies that recognize epitopes of a large surface molecule called MSP1 expressed on the P. falciparum merozoite surface can block the infection of new erythrocytes by merozoites released from a lysing RBC. Some of these antibodies appear to result from CD1-mediated presentation of part of the MSP1 protein to NKT cells, which may supply help to B cells in the form of secreted IL-4. Complementmediated lysis of merozoite-infected RBCs via the classical pathway also occurs. In addition to antigen-specific antibodies, there are abundant natural antibodies present in human serum that recognize widely distributed carbohydrate antigens. Parasites bearing these molecules in their cell walls can trigger both the classical and lectin pathways of complement activation. ib) IFN\u2425, Th1 responses, and macrophage hyperactivation. Like many intracellular bacteria, some parasites (e.g., L. major) resist destruction within an ordinary phagosome and actually enjoy life within a macrophage. These protozoans are resistant to or fail to induce the ordinary respiratory burst in activated macrophages. Only in a hyperactivated macrophage are there sufficient levels of RNI to efficiently kill such parasites. TNF produced by hyperactivated macrophages also plays an important but ill-defined role in anti-L. major responses, since administration of anti-TNF antibodies to cultures of IFN\u2425-treated macrophages blocks their ability to kill L. major. If even hyperactivated macrophages cannot clear the infection, a granuloma is formed to contain the threat.",

However, L. major also infects Langerhans cells in the epidermis, which become the prime initiators of the T cell-mediated immune response to this organism. In mouse models, L. major infection of DCs immediately induces these cells to produce copious quantities of IL-12. This IL-12 drives activated anti-parasite Th0 cells along the Th1 path, an event absolutely crucial for defense against L. major because these cells secrete the IFN\u2425 required to hyperactivate macrophages. Mouse strains that are abnormally susceptible to L. major infection, such as the inbred strain BALB/c, are naturally incapable of inducing Th1 responses and mount ineffective Th2 responses instead. Th2 responses are unhelpful in this situation because Th2 cytokines such as TGF\u2424, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 inhibit IFN\u2425 production and suppress the activation of iNOS.

Studies in vitro have shown that IFN\u2425 eliminates sporozoites from infected hepatocytes in culture, and mice treated with IFN\u2425 prior to infection with sporozoites are partially protected. Secondly, IFN\u2425 establishes a positive feedback loop of Th1 differentiation because it stimulates IL-12 production by DCs and macrophages.

Engagement of CD40 on macrophages and DCs by CD40L on activated T cells promotes the production of IL-12 by these APCs. In the absence of such engagement and IL-12 production, the Th1 response and IFN\u2425 production cannot be sustained, and the animals become vulnerable to the parasite.

In infected cells in which protozoan parasites escape from the macrophage phagosome into the cytosol, parasite antigens may enter the endogenous antigen processing system and be presented on MHC class I. CD8 \u03e9 T cells are then activated and respond to the threat. Indeed, acute disease in experimental mice caused by L. major or T. gondii is exacerbated if the host is depleted of CD8 \u03e9 T cells by injection of anti-CD8 antibodies prior to infection. However, CTL-mediated cytolysis is not actually very effective against acute protozoan infections. Rather, it is the secretion of IFN\u2425 by activated parasite-specific CTLs that is important. Similarly, IFN\u2425 secretion by \u2425\u2426 T cells has been implicated at the sporozoite stage of malarial infections, since parasite loads are increased in animals lacking these cells.

Activated CD4 \u03e9 T cells are critical for anti-helminth defense because these cells differentiate into effectors supplying the Th2 cytokines and CD40L contacts required for isotype switching to IgE by B cells. Circulating IgE directed against worm surface molecules can bind to the pathogen, attracting the attention of circulating eosinophils expressing FcRI molecules at a moderate density. Alternatively, prior to encountering specific antigen, the anti-parasite IgE may bind to mast cells expressing high levels of FcRI, allowing these cells to \"pre-arm\" against the parasite. In either case, the interaction of parasite antigen, anti-parasite IgE, and FcRI triggers intracellular signaling within eosinophils and mast cells that induces degranulation in close proximity to the worm. Eosinophil granules contain a variety of chemical substances that work directly and indirectly to kill the worm. Some molecules degrade the skin of the worm, creating an opening that allows other eosinophils to penetrate into its underlying tissues. These cells also degranulate and release additional toxic proteins and peptides that kill the worm. In addition, certain enzymes released from the eosinophil granule can further stimulate the release of histamine by activated mast cells. Histamine causes the contraction of host intestinal and bronchial smooth muscles that is associated with peristalsis and bronchospasm. The actions of these muscles can shake the parasite loose from its grip on the mucosae and expel it from the body. Histamine is also directly toxic to some helminth parasites. iib) Roles of Th2 cytokines in anti-helminth defense. The Th2 cytokines IL-5, IL-4, and IL-13 are vitally important for defense against helminth worms. IL-5 strongly promotes the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of eosinophils, and supports the differentiation of plasma cells that have undergone isotype switching to IgA production. As we learned in Chapter 20, IgA is the precursor to secretory IgA that coats the mucosae and fends off parasite attachment, particularly that of schistosome worms. In humans, IL-5 expression is strongly associated with resistance to S. mansonii infection.

An individual resistant to one strain of the parasite who travels to a new region will therefore likely be susceptible to the strain dominant in that region. Moreover, within the same host, successive populations of RBCs infected with the same strain of P. falciparum can express slightly different versions of certain parasite proteins. The expression of the novel antigens confounds antibodies previously raised against the antigens expressed in the first wave. In addition, many proteins necessary for parasite development are expressed only during the developmental stage in which they are required.

In addition, Plasmodium-infected RBCs express a parasite-encoded adhesion protein that allows the RBCs to bind to integrins on the surfaces of DCs and macrophages. This binding blocks the activation of macrophages and interferes with the maturation of DCs, thus inhibiting APC function and T cell responses. The erythrocytic stage of malaria infection can also induce the accelerated apoptosis of antigen-specific memory T cells. L. major uses slightly different tactics to manipulate the host immune response. The reader will recall from our previous discussion of viral evasion strategies that the cross-linking of CD46, complement receptors, or Fc\u2425Rs on macrophages by viral components inhibits IL-12 production at the transcriptional level. Similarly, molecules expressed by L. major promastigotes and amastigotes can bind to macrophage CR3 and Fc\u2425Rs, respectively, and reduce IL-12 production. The Th1 response that would kill the parasite is thus inhibited. Lastly, some parasites secrete hormone-like peptides that appear to downregulate the host immune response.",

Some fungi live commensally on the topologically external surfaces of the body, while others live most of their lives in the soil as a mass (mycelium) of thread-like processes (hyphae). Dimorphic fungi adopt a yeast-like form at one stage in their life cycle and a hyphal form at another stage. Fungal cells have a cell wall like bacteria but also a cell membrane like mammalian cells. However, the fungal cell wall lacks the peptidoglycans, teichoic acids, and lipopolysaccharide components of the bacterial wall, and the main component of the fungal cell membrane is ergosterol rather than the cholesterol found in mammalian cell membranes. Most fungal species are not harmful to healthy humans. However, immunocompromised individuals can suffer from acute infections that sometimes go on to become persistent. Such is the case with many Candida and Aspergillus species, which are part of the normal host flora but which can start to become invasive if immune surveillance by phagocytes fails. Species of soil-living filamentous fungi produce progeny in the form of conidia (spores), which can become airborne and thus inhaled by a host. Within the host, the conidia develop into either hyphae or other specialized forms better suited for host tissue invasion. However a pathogenic fungus accesses the body, its primary target tissue is usually the vascular system. Invasion of blood vessels by a growing fungus chokes off the blood supply to the host tissue, damaging or killing it. The exceptions are the dermatophytes, filamentous fungi that infect the skin, hair, and nails.

Important fungal pathogens are Blastomyces dermatitidis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Candida species, Aspergillus species, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Pneumocystis carinii (Table 22 -13). Blastomycosis occurs when conidia of the yeast-like fungus B. dermatitidis are inhaled. This organism replicates extracellularly to cause a pulmonary infection that spreads through the blood to the skin, bones, and male urogenital tract, but not the gut. In contrast, H. capsulatum is an intracellularly replicating yeast-like fungus that causes histoplasmosis. Inhaled microconidia develop into Histoplasma that take up residence preferentially in local respiratory macrophages. A progressive pulmonary disease resembling tuberculosis can spread to the secondary lymphoid organs, mucosae, gut, and adrenal glands. Candida species such as C. albicans and C. tropicalis lurk in the normal flora at the mucosae (but not in the skin) and cause disease only if these mucosal barriers are compromised. A deficiency of neutrophils in the host (neutropenia) leaves him or her especially vulnerable to candidiasis. Such Candida infections are usually fairly superficial in nature (such as vaginitis and cystitis) but can progress to infections of the eye, skin, and brain. entrench. Again, neutropenia is an aggravating factor. Clumps of filamentous Aspergillus readily colonize previously damaged airway tissues. Aspergillus species also produce mycotoxins that damage hepatocytes, macrophages, and CTLs. C. neoformans is a yeast-like fungus often present in pigeon droppings. When the unencapsulated spores of Cryptococcus are inhaled by a host, the parasite enters the lung and synthesizes a protective capsule that inhibits phagocytosis. If the infection becomes established, the result may be cryptococcosis, a syndrome of pulmonary infection accompanied by meningitis. P. carinii is a unicellular eukaryote that, although classified as a fungus, shares structural features with the protozoan parasites. P. carinii infection causes PCP (P. carinii pneumonia), a common feature in immunocompromised individuals (especially AIDS patients). Inhalation of P. carinii results in severe lung damage in hosts lacking cell-mediated immune responses. Spread of the infection to other tissues does not usually occur.",

There is some evidence that either distinct subsets of DCs, or distinct receptors on DCs, respond to the two different fungal morphologies. These DCs then proceed with phagocytosis and antigen processing and presentation, and influencing Th1/Th2 differentiation in the direction best suited to eliminate the particular form of the fungus present.

Over the years, it was found that each of these diseases could be transmitted to experimental animals by injecting brain extracts from patients or animals that had died of SE. Indeed, D. Carleton Gajdusek was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1976 for his discovery in the early 1960s that kuru in humans represented a new form of infectious disease. However, while an infectious etiology had been clearly established, the actual agents involved remained mysterious. Analysis of the scrapie agent revealed it to be extremely resistant to heat, formalin, and both UV-and ionizing irradiation-all treatments that normally destroy infectious pathogens. Furthermore, scrapie, kuru, and vCJD did not provoke any of the normal immune responses expected during an infection. An infectious etiology was also difficult to reconcile with the earlier identification in the 1930s of a rare, familial form of vCJD that presumably had a genetic etiology.

Surprisingly, protocols that destroyed nucleic acids had no effect on scrapie infectivity, while procedures known to destroy proteins reduced its infectious strength. By 1982, Prusiner concluded that the agent responsible for scrapie infectivity was a protein devoid of any nucleic acid, an unprecedented discovery in biology. At this point, he coined the term \"prion\" to identify this novel type of pathogen that was both proteinaceous and infectious. The scrapie agent was therefore denoted as PrP sc (prion protein, scrapie) . Further work by Prusiner established that PrP sc was actually a conformational isomer of a normal glycoprotein found on the surfaces of many mammalian cells. This normal glycoprotein was denoted PrP c (prion protein, cellular). It turns out that, upon exposure to a PrP sc molecule, a PrP c molecule undergoes a dramatic change in conformation. An \u2423-helical region of the native PrP c protein spontaneously re-folds into the \u2424-pleated sheet structure characteristic of PrP sc . This refolding process appears to be facilitated by an as-yet-unidentified co-factor (perhaps a membrane lipid). It is also unclear exactly where the conversion occurs, although there is some evidence pointing to the minute infoldings of the plasma membrane generated during pinocytosis (called caveolae) as the site. In any case, when PrP sc is introduced into a fresh host, it acts as a template for the refolding of existing host PrP c molecules into additional copies of PrP sc . In other words, the disease-causing prion can effectively \"replicate\" itself in a new host and a mass conversion of the host's PrP c molecules to the PrP sc conformation occurs (Fig. 22-15 ). Unlike PrP c , the misfolded PrP sc has profoundly altered physicochemical properties. When the PrP sc protein invades cells of the CNS, it induces brain degeneration that is manifested as the clinical signs of SE. Intriguingly, no other part of the body appears to be affected by the presence of PrP sc . For his discovery of prions and his investigations into the mechanisms by which they cause disease, Dr. Prusiner was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1997.",

The use of sheep offal as animal feed is now banned, but 1 million cattle were thought to have been infected with prions before this restriction came into place. Infectious prions are also responsible for the human disease kuru. Kuru was found almost exclusively among the Fore people of New Guinea, a tribe that used to routinely engage in ritualistic cannibalism. This practice included eating the brain tissue of dead relatives, some of whom had died of kuru. At the urging of missionaries, I M M U N IT Y TO PATHOG E N S 22 the practice of cannibalism ended in the late 1950s, so that the incidence of kuru has declined steadily since that time.",

The host's T cells are usually tolerant to the PrP sc protein, as it is merely a naturally occurring host protein with modified secondary structure. Thus, almost all peptides generated from newly formed PrP sc will be seen as \"self\" peptides. By extension, in the absence of the activation of prion-specific T cells, no Td humoral response can be mounted. Furthermore, although the \"foreign\" conformation of PrP sc might be recognized by the BCR of a B cell, the antigen itself cannot act as a Ti immunogen as it has neither the large size or multi-valency needed to stimulate B cells directly.",

In so-called PrP 0/0 mice, in which the gene encoding PrP c has been knocked out, the natural tolerance to the protein is absent and a normal, PrP c -specific humoral response is seen after immunization with murine PrP c in adjuvant. In another experiment, PrP 0/0 mice were immunized with plasmids expressing DNA (see Ch.23) encoding human prion proteins, inducing production of mouse anti-human PrP c antibodies. Similarly, chickens immunized with either human or bovine PrP c coupled to the carrier KLH generate antibodies directed against human or bovine PrP c . Such anti-PrP c antibody preparations are useful for both the study of prions and as potential tools for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of prion diseases.",

However, it appears that the immune system may actually promote the progress of prion disease both directly and indirectly. In a natural setting, prion infection occurs by a peripheral route, usually oral. Leukocytes are among the first cells to take up the prions, but the \"replication\" of the prions via PrP c conversion causes no harm to these cells, in contrast to the severe damage done to neurons. However, leukocytes are apparently responsible for the subsequent introduction of prions into the CNS. In addition, it seems that the FDC in the lymphoid follicles is required for the replication of prions that precedes their spread into the nervous system. The mechanism remains obscure but is an absolute requirement for prion disease progression. There is also evidence that the activation of specific complement components plays a role in the initial trapping of prions in the lymphoid organs soon after infection. This too may relate to FDC function, since C3d/C4b-opsonized antigens interact with CR2/CR1 complement receptors on FDC and may therefore be important for the intracellular accumulation of prions in the FDC. Other studies have suggested that macrophages and DCs can be involved in prion disease, and that a microbial or viral pathogen may sometimes act as a triggering co-factor.",

In these experiments, susceptibility to prion disease correlated with the functional status of the immune system. For example, while mitogenic stimulation of lymphoid cells enhanced prion disease susceptibility, lymphoid suppression achieved by either corticosteroid administration or splenectomy reduced it. In addition, studies of mice assessed at various time points after birth showed that increasing susceptibility to prion infection correlated with the progressive maturation of the immune system. Lastly, and perhaps most strikingly, scid mice (which cannot mount either T or B cell-mediated responses) were resistant to infection by the BSE or scrapie agents, while immunologically reconstituted scid mice were not. A more complete understanding of prion infection and disease processes will be critical to development of prevention strategies and therapies for these fascinating but deadly disorders.",

For all types of pathogens, the mechanisms of innate immunity offer an immediate response that either foils the establishment of infection or slows the infection down until adaptive immune mechanisms can target the pathogen more effectively. When an adaptive immune response is activated, the elements that will be most effective depend on whether the pathogen is extracellular or intracellular. Extracellular entities that are relatively small, such as extracellular bacteria, virus particles, protozoan parasites, and some fungi, can be targeted by antibody and then cleared effectively by antibodyand complement-mediated mechanisms that involve either direct lysis or phagocytic destruction. Protozoan worms are also subject to antibody assault because they are extracellular; however, these organisms are too large to be subsequently engulfed.",
