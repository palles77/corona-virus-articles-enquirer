Laboratory management is responsible ultimately to implement the procedures and work practices necessary to ensure a safe work environment and to adequately train and educate their employees in laboratory safety. This is a challenging task for clinical microbiology laboratories as globalization increases the dispersion of infectious agents throughout the world, climate changes expand the endemic ranges of some microbial pathogens and their vectors, new microbial pathogens are recognized, antimicrobial resistance increases, acts of bioterrorism are threatened, and new technologies and tests are introduced into the laboratory. These events expand the potential exposure of clinical microbiologists and other health care workers to infrequently encountered infectious agents. Considering all of these factors, it is increasingly difficult for regulatory agencies and professional organizations to provide detailed up-to-date safety guidelines for all new situations. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS) recently published guidelines for the protection of laboratorians from occupationally acquired infections (1). A portion of this report is a review of the safety recommendations outlined in that document.",

The exception has been the national reporting of occupationally acquired HIV infections to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For other LAIs, risk is estimated based on historic data, case reports, periodic surveys of laboratories, and personal communications (2) . The his-torical data published by Pike (3, 4) were instrumental in identifying the risk associated with working in clinical and research laboratories and documenting the common routes of transmission (Table 1) . However, these data were published in the 1970s and are not reflective of modern laboratories, due in part to the implementation of many safety procedures and work practices based on Pike's observations. Today, the general consensus is that LAIs are infrequent but occur most often in individuals who work in the clinical microbiology laboratory (5,6). Wilson and Reller (7) estimated that the annual rate of LAIs in the U.S. is approximately 1 to 5 infections per 1,000 employees.",

This concept is fundamental to safety in the microbiology laboratory and, if practiced, will prevent or reduce the contact of potentially infectious material with the skin or mucous membranes of laboratorians (1). Two key components of laboratory safety are proper hand hygiene (23) and the use of gloves when performing routine laboratory work with blood or other potentially infectious material or contacting surfaces potentially contaminated with these materials (1). Frequent hand hygiene is extremely important, and the hands should be washed with soap and water (or an alcohol-based product) after removal of gloves, after accidental skin contact with potentially infectious material, or after a break in a glove. Soap and water should be used when hands are visibly contaminated with potentially infectious material. Whether gloves should be required for routine bench work in the microbiology laboratory is a question that has been discussed for years. There is no doubt that laboratory surfaces are contaminated, (22) but to my knowledge, there is no specific regulation that requires the use of gloves while manipulating cultures. However, clinical microbiologists should be given the option of wearing gloves, if they choose.",
