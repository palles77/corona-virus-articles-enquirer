            "text": "Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) are useful agents for studying experimental infections of the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems (1) . MHV are members of the Coronavirus group of animal viruses. The virion is composed of three structural proteins, the major glycoprotein (E2 or peplomer), a minor glycoprotein (El or matrix), and a nucleocapsid protein (N) (2) . In order to better understand the pathogenesis and immune response induced by these viruses, attempts have been made to alter the course of infection by administering monoclonal antibodies specific for viral structural proteins. Buchmeier and colleagues showed that some, but not all, neutralizing anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies protected mice from challenge with the neurotropic strain MHV-4 (JHMV) (3) . Interestingly, mice protected from acute encephalitis by anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies subsequently developed demyelination. Wege et al, (4) demonstrated that anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies protected suckling rats from MHV-4; these investigators also found that only anti-E2 monoclonal antibodies that both neutralized virus and inhibited cell fusion were protective. Nakanaga et a/. (5) examined monoclonal antibodies reactive with MHV-2 and showed that both anti-E2 and anti-N monoclonal antibodies protected mice from lethal MHV-2 induced hepatitis. Most recently, Lecomte et a/. (6) have reported that an anti-N monoclonal antibody which neutralizes MHV-3 in vitro in the presence of complement protects mice from lethal MHV-3 challenge.",

            "text": "In view of the demonstrations that anti-E2 and anti-N monoclonal antibodies protected rodents infected with ' MHV, we sought to determine whether monoclonal antibodies specific for the third structural protein, the El or matrix glycoprotein, could alter disease. Four monoclonal antibodies directed against the El glycoprotein of MHV-4 were evaluated for their ability to neutralize virus in vitro and protect mice from a normally fatal viral challenge (Table 1) . Unless stated otherwise, experiments used 6-week-old male C57BU6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) (seronegative for MHV) which were given 100 pg of purified monoclonal antibody intraperitoneally (ip) on the same day as intracerebral (ic) inoculation of 2000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MHV-4, strain JHMV DS (7). Talbot and Buchmeier (8) have recently shown that administration of murine monoclonal antibodies ip results in significant, persistent plasma antibody titers in mice. In the absence of passively administered antibody, challenge with 2000 PFU ic of MHV-4, strain JHMV DS, led to a fatal encephalitis within 1 O-l 2 days in 26 of 29 mice. Monoclonal antibodies J. 1.3 and J.3.9 were found to protect mice from lethal ic challenge with MHV-4 (Table 1). However, monoclonal antibodies J.2.7 and J.3.1 1 consistently failed to protect mice, even when the amount of antibody was increased to 200 pg per recipient (data not shown). Protection did not correlate with IgG subclass, as IgG2a antibodies were both protective (J. 1.3 and J.3.9) and nonprotective (J.3.1 1). Also, protection did not correlate with virus neutralization in vitro in the presence of complement, since protective monoclonal antibodies J. 1.3 and J.3.9 were neutralizing and nonneutralizing in vitro, respectively (Table 1) . This result was unexpected, since, with the exception of two monoclonal antibodies reported by Nakanaga et a/. (5) , all previously described anti-MHV monoclonal antibodies which protect in viva neutralize virus in vitro. (40) In order to determine if protective antibodies were associated with a unique topographic site on the El molecule, we performed competitive binding studies with biotinylated antibodies, using previously described methods (9) . In this regard, Talbot et al. (10) have shown that the MHV-4 El has at least two major antigenic sites. Talbot et a/. (11) measured antibodies against one of these sites on El and found that significant amounts of antibody were produced during experimental infection. In preliminary studies, it was found that J.1.3 and J.3.9 recognize different antigenic sites on El. Furthermore, nonprotective antibodiesJ.2.7 and J.3.1 1 appear to bind to a site which overlaps the site recognized by J.1.3 (data not shown). Thus, it seems unlikely that protection is associated with binding to a single critical determinant on El. Although we did find a correlation between protection and the high relative avidities of monoclonal antibodies 1.1.3 and J.3.9 (Table l), additional testing with a larger panel of anti-El monoclonal antibodies will be required to evaluate the significance of this observation.",

By contrast, mice protected by monoclonal antibody J.3.9 had no decrease in viral titer relative to that of unprotected control animals.

In unprotected mice, viral antigen was readily demonstrable in neurons of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus 5 days after inoculation (Fig. 1A) . Inflammation in meninges, brain parenchyma, and perivascular spaces (Fig. 1 C) was usually minimal to moderate. By contrast, mice protected with antibody J.1.3 showed much less involvement of neurons ( Fig. 1 B) , although inflammatory infiltrates in meninges, brain parenchyma, and perivascular spaces were often severe (Fig. 1 D) . Subacutely, at Day +30, protected mice showed rarefaction and intense inflammation in white matter, typical of MHV-4-induced demyelination (9) (Fig. 1 E) . These studies demonstrate that administration of monoclonal antibodies specific for the El protein of MHV protect mice from lethal viral challenge. The mechanism of this protection, however, remains uncertain. The evidence we have gathered indicates that anti-El monoclonal antibodies did not protect by virtue of a particular antibody isotype or by means of recognition of a specific topographic site on E 1. Neither in vitro neutralization nor reduction in viral replication in viva appeared to be an essential characteristic of protective antibodies; similarly, complement activity in viva also did not appear to be necessary for protection. On the other hand, histologic studies revealed distinctive findings which may indicate how anti-El monoclonal antibodies protect mice from MHV-4 challenge. We found that protected mice had increased parenchymal and perivascular cellular infiltration when compared to unprotected controls, similar to results reported by Nakanaga et a/. (5) . This suggests that passive anti-MHV antibody administration enhances cell-mediated immunity. One mechanism by which antibody may enhance cell-mediated immunity to viruses involves binding to Fc receptors on antigen presenting cells or to specific receptors on T cells. Experimentally, effector functions of T cells have been shown to be increased by these means after administration of antibodies to hepatitis B virus (20) .",

Thus, it appears that any variable which allows animals to survive the initial MHV-4 encephalitis, perhaps by attenuating viral cytopathogenicity for neurons, permits subacute demyelination to be manifest. Similarly, Harty et a/. (27) demonstrated that nonneutralizing antibodies to lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus protected mice from motor neuron disease, although the level of viral replication was unchanged. In these studies, antibody appeared to block the infection of neurons, while having no effect on the infection of nonneuronal central nervous system cells. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the observation that neurons are usually the critical targets of highly neurovirulent viruses. (28) . Nonneutralizing monoclonal antibodies have also been shown to protect animals against other neurotropic viruses, including Sindbis (29) (30) (31) , Semliki Forest (12, 32) , Western equine encephalitis (33) , Venezuelan equine encephalitis (13), St. Louis encephalitis (Id), herpes simplex (34), vesicular stomatitis (15) , and yellow fever viruses (7635).",
