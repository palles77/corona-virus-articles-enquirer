Eigenvector centrality is thus an extension of degree that can identify hubs of 312 parasite sharing (G\u00f3mez, Nunn, & Verd\u00fa, 2013). These two metrics were moderately correlated 313 (\u03c1=0.59), with many non-zero degree species displaying zero eigenvector centrality.

Bacterial pathogens have been especially understudied for bats 79 (M\u00fchldorfer, 2013), in contrast to intensive studies of zoonotic viruses across the Chiroptera 80 (Luis et al., 2015). However, many bacterial pathogens are likely important to both bat 81 conservation and human health due to pathogenic effects on bats themselves as well as their 82 zoonotic potential (Becker et al., 2018; Evans, Bown, Timofte, Simpson, & Birtles, 2009). 83 To determine the ecological and evolutionary drivers of bacterial prevalence and barriers 84 to pathogen sharing, we focused on hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (i.e., hemoplasmas) in a 85 species-rich bat community in Belize (Fenton et al., 2001; Herrera, Duncan, Clare, Fenton, & 86 Simmons, 2018). The Neotropics have remarkable bat diversity owing to adaptive radiation in 87 the Phyllostomidae (Gunnell & Simmons, 2012), producing a range of feeding strategies (e.g., 88 frugivory, carnivory, sanguivory), body sizes, and roost preferences (Monteiro & Nogueira, 89 2011). Hemoplasmas are intracellular erythrocytic bacteria transmitted through direct contact 90 (Cohen et al., 2018; Museux et al., 2009) and also possibly arthropod vectors (Willi, Boretti, 91 Meli, et al., 2007). Hemoplasmas can cause acute and chronic anemia, especially for 92 immunocompromised hosts; however, many animals develop inapparent infections and are 93",

We used the nlme package 249 to estimate phylogenetic signal as Pagel's \u03bb with a weighted phylogenetic generalized least 250 squares (PGLS) model to account for within-species variance (Garamszegi, 2014). We next used 251 a graph-partitioning algorithm, phylogenetic factorization, to flexibly identify clades with 252 significantly different prevalence estimates at various taxonomic depths. We used the taxize 253 package to obtain a bat taxonomy from the National Center for Biotechnology Information 254 (Chamberlain & Sz\u00f6cs, 2013) and used the phylofactor package to partition prevalence as a 255Bernoulli-distributed response in a GLM(Washburne et al., 2019).

            "text": "the prevalence and distribution of a common bacterial pathogen (hemoplasmas) in 411 a diverse bat community, we expanded analysis of the ecological and evolutionary predictors of 412 bat infection and pathogen sharing beyond viruses. Across the bat community, hemoplasma 413 infection risk was weakly higher for males but was better predicted by phylogeny, with large-414 bodied and large-colony bat species showing greater prevalence. Hemoplasmas showed high 415 diversity and mostly strict host associations, with strong congruence between the bat and 416 hemoplasma phylogenies. Although codivergence was supported by our analyses, we also 417 genotype sharing and evidence of historical host shifts between closely 418 related bats. Species most central to this hemoplasma sharing network displayed taxonomic 419 clustering and were disproportionately frugivores and nectarivores. Yet these highly central bat 420 species did not also have the highest hemoplasma prevalence, reinforcing mostly infrequent 421 bacterial sharing between species. Our work reveals phylogenetic patterns in hemoplasma 422 infection in a diverse bat community while contributing to broader efforts to understand the host 423 specificity of bacterial pathogens and their cross-species transmission patterns in wildlife.424 Whereas many bacterial pathogens, including hemoplasmas, are common in bats (Bai et 425 al., 2011; Becker et al., 2018; Ikeda et al., 2017; Mascarelli et al., 2014; Mill\u00e1n et al., 2015; 426 Volokhov et al., 2017), the factors that confer high infection probability are poorly understood. 427 In the Belize bat community, the odds of hemoplasma infection tended to be higher in males, 428 suggesting male-biased transmission as detected in feline and canine systems (Soto et al., 2017; 429 Walker Vergara et al., 2016). Such patterns could stem from males mounting weaker immune 430 responses than females (Kelly, Stoehr, Nunn, Smyth, & Prokop, 2018) or to male defense of 431 multi-female roosts in many Neotropical bat species (Voigt, von Helversen, Michener, & Kunz, 432 2001). Direct transmission of hemoplasmas has been demonstrated in feline and rodent systems 433 (Cohen et al., 2018; Museux et al., 2009) but only inferred in bats from metagenomic studies 434 detecting these bacteria in saliva (Volokhov et al., 2017). We found weak support for the 435 hypothesis that ectoparasites play a role in infection risks (Hornok et al., 2019; Willi, Boretti, 436 Meli, et al., 2007). The weak male bias in infection could cast further doubt on vector-borne 437 transmission, as females in some bat species have elevated ectoparasitism (Frank, support for a female bias in ectoparasitism in our system (Fig. S9). Future work 440 assessing ectoparasite burdens could better elucidate the roles of vectors in hemoplasma risk. 441 Across Neotropical bats sampled in Belize, we found phylogeny to be a better predictor 442 of hemoplasma risk than individual traits, site, or year. Phylogenetic factorization identified one 443 clade, the Emballonuridae, with significantly lower prevalence than all other bats in the 444 community. This moderate phylogenetic signal mirrors comparable effects of phylogeny for bat 445 viruses (Guy, Thiagavel, Mideo, & Ratcliffe, 2019), similarly suggesting potential for innate 446 differences in species susceptibility or pathogen exposure. Trait-based analyses revealed that this 447 taxonomic pattern was driven by heavier and large-colony species having greater hemoplasma 448 prevalence. Small-bodied species could have low prevalence due to small blood volumes and 449 low bacterial titers (Volokhov et al., 2017). Alternatively, the positive, saturating relationship 450 between body mass and bacterial prevalence could be driven by allometric patterns in 451 competence (Downs et al., 2019), in contrast to weak or opposite relationships between mass and 452 viral richness across bats (Guy et al., 2019; Han, Schmidt, et al., 2016). As larger-bodied bat 453 species can also be more abundant in Neotropical habitat fragments (Herrera et al., 2018), these 454 results suggest land conversion could increase the frequency of bat species most capable of 455 maintaining hemoplasma infection. Similarly, positive relationships between colony size and 456 prevalence could support density-dependent transmission of bacteria (McCallum et al., 2001), 457 whereas mixed support has been found for bat viruses (Streicker et al., 2012; Webber, Fletcher, 458 & Willis, 2017). Future work could test how community-wide infection patterns vary across 459 broader habitat gradients and use multiple bacteria to assess the generality of these trends. 460 Approximately two-thirds of the Neotropical bat species sampled in Belize were infected 461 by hemoplasmas, for which we observed high genetic diversity consistent with other studies of 462 previously identified from vampire bats (Volokhov et al., 2017). When considering the 466 phylogenetic scale of genotypes, most hemoplasmas were host specific. Over half our 467 hemoplasma communities consisted of a single bat-genotype association, matching the degree of 468 host specificity observed more generally for Mycoplasma spp. (Citti & Blanchard, 2013; Pitcher 469 & Nicholas, 2005). When we did detect genotype sharing between species, this occurred mostly 470 between closely related hosts (e.g., PPM was detected in Pteronotus mesoamericanus and P. 471 fulvus), indicating bat phylogenetic distance decreased the probability of bacterial transfer. 472 Analyses to characterize species centrality to the hemoplasma genotype sharing network 473 showed that one species (Artibeus lituratus) and the subfamily Stenodermatinae played key 474 roles. This clade, and especially the genera Artibeus and Dermanura (formerly all classified in 475 Artibeus), was the only taxon with non-zero connectivity, and this pattern was reflected in fruit-476 and nectar-based diets and small colonies being the primary predictors of centrality. The strictly 477 frugivorous Stenodermatinae represents a recent divergence in the Phyllostomidae (Botero-478 Castro et al., 2013), and high centrality of these species may indicate weaker phylogenetic 479 barriers for bacterial transmission between hosts in this clade. Two other analyses reinforced 480 infrequent and conserved hemoplasma sharing between species. First, phylogenetic patterns in 481",

            "text": "closely related hosts (De Vienne et al., 2013). Though we cannot rule out that some 486 host shifts may be artefacts of the limited resolution of both the phylogenies, our evolutionary 487 analyses and genotype sharing results imply that hemoplasma host shifts are possible yet rare. 488 By sampling a diverse assemblage of bacterial genotypes in an ecologically and 489 evolutionary rich host community, our work has broader implications for our understanding of 490 disease emergence. Many bacterial pathogens are thought to be generalists and relatively 491 unlikely to specialize in a novel host (Pedersen, Altizer, Poss, Cunningham, & Nunn, 2005; 492 Woolhouse & Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005), in contrast to many viruses in which host shifts are 493 more common owing to high mutation rates and short infectious periods (Geoghegan et al., 2017; 494 Longdon, Brockhurst, Russell, Welch, & Jiggins, 2014). Recent theoretical work suggests host 495 shift speciation may be less common for bacteria because of higher phenotypic plasticity (e.g., 496 the ability to reside in diverse habitats) and a slower tempo of evolution (Bonneaud et al., 2019). 497 Obligate reliance of Mycoplasma spp. on host cells and more chronic infections likely explains 498 their propensity to specialize (Citti & Blanchard, 2013; Cohen et al., 2018). More broadly, 499 however, using genetics to infer pathogen sharing, rather than coarser phylogenetic scales (e.g., 500 species complexes or genera), is increasingly showing that many bacterial strains may be more 501 host specific (Withenshaw, Devevey, Pedersen, & Fenton, 2016). The high specialism of bat 502 hemoplasma genotypes thus underscores the importance of using finer phylogenetic scales in the 503 study of infectious disease (Fountain-Jones et al., 2018; Graham, Storch, & Machac, 2018). 504 Comparative analyses of viruses have suggested that phylogenetically conserved 505 pathogen jumps between species may be a broader generality in the study of disease emergence 506 (Albery, Eskew, Ross, & Olival, 2019; Luis et al., 2015; Streicker et al., 2010). With few 507 exceptions, our results on hemoplasma genotype sharing between Neotropical bat species are 508 with this pattern for a bacterial pathogen. Two cases in which hemoplasmas 509 were shared between more distantly related species included the VBG1 genotype in Desmodus 510 rotundus and Pteronotus fulvus (Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae) and the EF1 genotype in 511 Glossophaga soricina and Saccopteryx bilineata (Phyllostomidae and Emballonuridae). For the 512 latter, both bat species co-roost in the LAR, which suggests an ecological context for pathogen 513 exposure over current timescales. However, other genetic markers (e.g., rpoB, rpoC, gyrB) 514 would be necessary to infer contemporary cross-species transmission (K\u00e4mpfer & Glaeser, 2012; 515 Volokhov et al., 2012), as analysis of the 16s rRNA gene alone is insufficient for hemoplasma 516 species identification (Volokhov et al., 2012). If hemoplasmas are more likely to specialize 517 rather than expand their range into new and unrelated species, genotype sharing between 518 unrelated bats could represent more transient spillovers (Bonneaud et al., 2019). As specialized 519 pathogens could be more transmissible than generalists (Garamszegi, 2006), species with high 520 infection prevalence of specialist genotypes could be prioritized for bacterial surveillance. 521 In conclusion, our analysis of a diverse community of bats and their pathogen genotypes 522 identifies several key ecological and evolutionary factors structuring bacterial infection within 523 and between species and provides a starting point for contrasts with such patterns for viruses. 524",

Sample size was similar between years 165 (2017=202, 2018=267) but varied by site (LAR=365, KK=101). More species were sampled for 166 blood at LAR (n=33) than KK (n=17;Fig. 1), reflecting site differences in species richness 167 (Herrera et al., 2018). We sampled 1-139 individuals per bat species (the maximum being 168Desmodus rotundus), with a mean of 14 individuals per bat species(Table S1). 169 DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and amplicon sequencing 171 Genomic DNA was extracted from blood on FTA cards using QIAamp DNA Investigator Kits 172(Qiagen). We tested DNA for hemoplasmas using PCR with primers and procedures described in173 prior analyses (Volokhov et al., 2017). We included blank FTA punches as an extraction control, 174 ultrapure water as a negative control, and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemozalophi DNA as a 175 positive control (Volokhov et al., 2011). Amplicons from PCR-positive samples were purified by 176 electrophoresis and extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). 177 To determine hemoplasma infection status, all 16S rRNA amplicons were directly 178 sequenced by Macrogen (https://www.macrogenusa.com/). Amplicons were sequenced with the 179 same primers used for PCR amplification and then with internal (walking) primers when needed 180 (Volokhov et al., 2017). Negative DNA samples were tested for amplification quality using the 181 universal PCR primers targeting the mammal mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene (Volokhov, Kong, 182 George, Anderson, & Chizhikov, 2008) or the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 183 gene (Clare, Lim, Engstrom, Eger, & Hebert, 2007); all hemoplasma-negative DNA samples 184 gave positive signal in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene-and/or the COI-specific PCR assays. 185 All amplified sequences were subjected to chimeric sequence analysis using DECIPHER 186 (Wright, Yilmaz, & Noguera, 2012) and UCHIME (Edgar, Haas, Clemente, Quince, & Knight, 187 2011). All hemoplasma sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers 188 Bartonella spp. during sequencing and were considered hemoplasma negative in our analyses. 190 Bat phylogenetic data 192 We used the rotl and ape packages in R to extract a bat phylogeny from the Open Tree of Life 193 and to calculate branch lengths with Grafen's method (Michonneau, Brown, & Winter, 2016; 194 Paradis, Claude, & Strimmer, 2004). To assess hemoplasma genotype sharing as a function of 195 host phylogenetic similarity, we derived pairwise phylogenetic distances between the 33 sampled 196 bat species (Fig. S1). Because more evolutionarily distant and distinct species could display less 197 frequent bacterial genotype sharing owing to ecological and immunological barriers to pathogen 198 exposure and replication (Huang, Drake, Gittleman, & Altizer, 2015), we used the picante 199 package and our bat phylogeny to derive evolutionary distinctiveness (Kembel et al., 2010). 200We obtained species-level data on host traits relevant to pathogen transmission from previously 203 published sources(Table S2). We obtained fecundity (litter size, litters per year), body mass, and 204 diet from the Amniote Life History and EltonTraits databases (Myhrvold et al., 2015; Wilman et 205 al., 2014).
