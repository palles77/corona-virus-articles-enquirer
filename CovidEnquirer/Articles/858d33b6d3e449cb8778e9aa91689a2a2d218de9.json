Sometimes their enhanced abilities to make a living outstripped their local environment's capacity to provide that living, and they caused local ecological disruptions. On several continents, for example, humans hunted large mammals to the point where many, such as the marsupial lion of Australia, went extinct. As humans became more efficient at exploiting their local environments, they spread farther. By 13,000 years ago, modern humans had spread to all continents and many islands across the globe.

As detailed by geographer and ecologist Diamond (1997 Diamond ( , 2002 , populations grew as agriculture developed, because larger sedentary populations both demanded and enabled more food production. Local ecological disruptions became more numerous and widespread and more intense. With animal domestication, contagious diseases of pets and livestock adapted to new, human hosts. Diseases spread more quickly in crowded conditions; inadequate sanitation compounded the effects. From agriculture, civilization followed and with it, cities, writing, advanced technology, and political empires. In just 10,000 years, these developments led to nearly 7 billion people on Earth, industrial societies, and a global economy founded on complicated technologies and fossil fuels. Humans have emerged as ecosystem engineers on a global scale.

Deforestation not only eliminated the humans' source of wood, but also further deprived the already poor soil of nutrients and made it impossible to sustain the agriculture that had sustained the island's civilization.

The mammoth Three Gorges Dam across China's Yangtze River, completed in 2006, created a 660-km-long serpentine lake behind it. The dam displaced more than 1 million people and may force the relocation of another 4 million from the reservoir region, which, at 58,000 km 2 , is larger than Switzerland. The dam has greatly altered ecosystems on the Yangtze's middle reaches, compounding perils already faced by prized and endemic fish and aquatic mammals. The sheer weight of the water and silt behind the concrete dam raises the risk of landslides and strains the region's geological structure, while water released from the dam eats away at downstream banks and scours the bottom. And by slowing the flow of the Yangtze and nearby tributaries, the dam drains the river's ability to flush out and detoxify pollutants from upstream industries.",

Although mammals and birds typically receive the most attention, massive extinctions of plants, which form the basis of the biosphere's food webs, undermine lifesupport foundations. The mutualistic relationships between animals and plants, particularly evident in tropical forests, mean that extinctions in one group have cascading effects in other groups. Plants reliant on animals for pollination or seed dispersal, for example, are themselves threatened by the extinction of the animal species they depend on. Not surprisingly, some scientists view extinction as the worst biological tragedy, but extinction is just another symptom of global biotic impoverishment.",

Children from impoverished communities, even in affluent nations, suffer from the lethargy and impaired physical and intellectual development known as failure to thrive. Poverty forces many children to work the land or in industrial sweatshops; lack of education prevents them from attaining their intellectual potential. This impoverishment in the lives of women and children is as much a symptom of biotic impoverishment as are deforestation, invasive alien organisms, or species extinctions.",

It begins to turn our attention away from questions such as, How much stress can landscapes and ecosystems absorb? to ones such as, How can responsible human actions protect and restore ecosystems? In contrast to risk assessment, striving to protect biological integrity is more likely to lead away from mandated corrective actions in the form of technological fixes for environmental problems and toward practices that prevent ecological degradation and encourage ecological restoration. Leopold (1949, pp. 224-225) , in A Sand County Almanac, was the first to invoke the concept of integrity in an ecological sense: ''A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.'' Managing for biological integrity requires the kind of ethical commitment inherent in Leopold's words. We are called to curb consumerism and limit population size, to embrace less-selfish attitudes toward land stewardship, and to understand that the biosphere matters. Instead of calling on human technical and spiritual wellsprings to manage resources, we have to call on them for managing human affairs.",

When managing for ecological risks, people and their governments need to expect the unexpected and develop formal, yet flexible means of coping with environmental surprises. Rather than plunge ahead with projects entailing ecological risks because they can be done, decision makers should follow the precautionary principle, which holds that regulators should act to prevent potential environmental harm even in the absence of certainty. It acknowledges the existence of uncertainty rather than deny it, and it includes mechanisms to safeguard against potentially harmful effects.",

A decade after the agreement's adoption, satellite measurements in the stratosphere indicated that ozone-depleting pollutants were in fact on the decline. Given the treaty's success, some policy experts have suggested using it to help curb global warming. Specifically, negotiators at the 2010 annual meeting of signatory parties were considering a proposed expansion of the ozone treaty to phase out the production and use of industrial chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons, which have thousands of times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. Even though the Montreal Protocol was not designed to fight climate change, policymakers in favor of the new proposal say that it could and should be used to achieve broader environmental objectives.",

Ecology arose to document and understand the interactions between organisms and their living and nonliving surroundings -in essence, how organisms make a living in the natural economy. In fact, Ernst Haeckel, who coined the term in the 1860s, defined ecology in an 1870 article as the body of knowledge concerning the economy of nature. Neoclassical economics, in contrast, reinforced humans' self-appointed dominion over nature's wealth. It brought unparalleled gains in societal welfare in some places, but it also divorced the human economy from the natural one on which it stands (see Figure 1) .",

We have altered Earth's physical and chemical environment, changed the planet's water and nutrient cycles, and perturbed its climate. We have unleashed the greatest mass extinction in 65 My and distorted the structure and function of nonhuman and human communities worldwide. In trying to make our own living, we have jeopardized the Earth's capacity to sustain other species and our own species as well. We are losing the bio in biosphere. Now, faced with these unprecedented losses, we need to understand -not deny -the ecological consequences of what we do. We urgently need a new science and art of home maintenance, one that sees the human species' role as ecosystem engineer for what it has become and reconnects human and natural economies. This new science can help us understand and correctly interpret the consequences of human-driven change. By using indicators that measure what matters for sustaining living systems, this new science can make nature visible again and shed new light on the value of the ancient heritage we share with the larger biosphere. It can help us reunite the fragments of our worldview and re-create ethical, social, and ecological bonds that were put aside two centuries ago in the name of progress. And such a science can enable us to reengineer our own social, political, and economic institutions instead of ecosystems. This we must donow -before we impoverish the biosphere and ourselves for all time.",
