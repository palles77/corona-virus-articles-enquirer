            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious respiratory disease to humans that is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In 2003, an atypical pneumonia due to SARS-CoV lead to progressive respiratory failure in over 8,000 individuals and 800 deaths within a few months. [1] [2] [3] Thereafter, the SARS epidemic was successfully controlled, but potential reemergence of pandemic SARS-CoV continues to be a risk, and new strains of SARS or a SARS-like virus could potentially be more infectious than the strains that led to the 2003 outbreak. Two human coronaviruses, NJ63 and HKU1, have been identified in patients around the world since 2003. [4] [5] [6] A more recently identified human coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has infected 114 people since April 2012 with a nearly 50% mortality rate, and this number keeps rising daily. 7, 8 Two Asian bat coronaviruses, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, have been shown to be the closest relations to MERS-CoV. 9 The possibility of a future SARS-like pandemic remains, and no vaccines or antiviral agents have yet been developed to prevent or treat SARS-like infections. 10 SARS-CoV is a novel human coronavirus featuring the largest positive-stranded RNA genome known to date (27 kb for pp1a and 31 kb for pp1b). The key enzyme in the processing of polypro-teins translated by the viral RNA genome of SARS-CoV is a 33 kDa protease called 3C-like protease (3CL protease). SARS 3CL protease is a cysteine protease containing a Cys-His catalytic dyad. It cleaves precursor polyproteins at as many as 11 conserved sites involving a conserved Gln at the P1 position and a small amino acid (Ser, Ala, or Gly) at the P 0 1 position. Due to its functional importance in the viral life cycle, SARS 3CL protease is considered to be an attractive target for drug design to treat SARS.",

The interactions of inhibitor (1) at the P1 and P2 sites with the protease seemed very effective. Additionally, a new synthetic method using acetal http to aldehyde conversion via thioacetal formation was described to afford the C-terminal peptide aldehyde. 19, 20 Side chain structures at the P1, P2 and P4 sites and C-terminus aldehyde as the thiol capture of tetrapeptide inhibitor (1) were thought to have a critical role in its potent inhibitory activity. In contrast, there is generally enzymatic digestion of peptide chains and a-proton racemization and/or low specificity of aldehyde functionality. To develop non-peptidyl small molecular inhibitors of the SARS 3CL protease focusing on the P1, P2 and P4 site interactions, we aimed to design and synthesize serine derivatives having the essential functional groups and evaluated their inhibitory activity in the present study. Serine, a commercially available proteinogenic amino acid, has three variant reaction sites; alcohol, amine and carboxylic acid, which can be orthogonally connected to various functional groups (Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "To determine whether a series of serine derivatives could adopt an energetically favorable conformation mimicking a tetrapeptide inhibitor (1), we performed a variety of molecular mechanics calculations with SPARTAN from Wavefunction and docking simulations of protein interactions by GOLD from CCDC. Firstly, imidazole, cyclohexyl and hydroxy groups, which were optimized functionalities with potent biological activities in the previous literature, were connected with L-serine to design the serine derivative (2a,b) as shown in Scheme 1. However, it did not give good coverage of the substrate-recognition pocket of 3CL protease (PDB code 3AW1), that is, the interactions with optimized motifs and the corresponding pockets were different by binding mode, contrary to expectations. The cyclohexyl group of serine derivative (2) occupied the S1 pocket of the 3CL protease imperatively. Thus, the imidazole and hydroxy groups of serine derivative (2) expected for the interactions with the S1 and S4 pockets were not effective and consequently the numbers of interaction atom pairs between the inhibitor (2) and SARS-CoV 3CL protease were diminished. In contrast, Bai 21 reported that the cinnamoyl derivatives inhibited SARS-CoV 3CL protease. In this case, the Bai's inhibitor locates deep insides of the S 0 1, S1 and S2 pockets with appropriate cinnamoyl functionalities. This result was approximately identified with the Bai's simulation employed by the AutoDock 3.0 estimated free energy of binding for the docking of the Bai's inhibitor to the SARS 3CL protease (PDB code 1UJ1). Therefore, we examined molecular docking of the serine derivatives contained together with benzoyl and aniline moieties to give 2c, which was an attractive ligand for the 3CL protease. Furthermore, we investigated a reasonable structure for the inhibitor and mode hybrid compounds with Bai's and our functionalities on the serine derivative (3) . As a result, we concluded that reasonable structures are N-cinnamoyl derivatives with benzoate for the side chain on virtual screening by GOLD. Compound 3 has the following characteristics: (a) since the sub-strates by nature have involved small amino acids (Ser, Ala or Gly) at the P 0 1 position, it may be preferable to adopt the aromatic rings. (b) The proper placement of the cyclohexyl ring may be the result of development of a serine type inhibitor with functionality of the P1 position, as well as stability of interaction of other positions. (c) The S4 pocket is rather hydrophobic in nature and therefore the corresponding side chains, namely aromatic, hydrocarbon or neutral functionalities, make good contact with target regions. (d) Additionally, the region adjacent to the ester bond of 3 is catalytic thiol functionality (Cys145) of the enzyme (Scheme 1).",

To evaluate inhibitory activity of the serine derivative (3) against SARS-CoV 3CL protease, a structure activity relationship study using the serine derivatives was attempted. As depicted in Scheme 2, the serine derivatives attached with three functionalities were prepared. Each coupling partner to introduce the functionalities is shown in Tables 1-3. Coupling of Fmoc-L-Ser(tBu)-OH and amines as a P1 moiety with WSC/HOBt followed by the deprotection of Fmoc group by 20% piperidine/DMF gave the serine amide derivative (4) at acceptable chemical yields. The P4 moiety was introduced by coupling with carboxylic acid in the presence of coupling reagents or acylation using carboxylic anhydride or acyl chloride to afford diamide derivatives. Subsequently, treatment of TFA for the deprotection of the t-butyl group gave alcohol (5) at moderate yields. Finally, the esterification of a hydroxy group of 5 with a variety of acyl reagents was performed to give novel serine derivatives (6, 7 and 8) for evaluation of the small molecular inhibitors against SARS 3CL protease. Purification of all crude compounds was performed by silica gel column chromatography. The chemical structures for synthetic compounds were mainly determined by 1 H and 13 C NMRs, IR and mass spectra (Scheme 2).",

Treatment of 4a with 3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid in the presence of HATU/HOAt/DIPEA in CH 2 Cl 2 also gave 5b in 79% yield after removal of t-butyl group (entry 2). Since 5c was not isolated by the condition of HATU/HOAt, we found that DMT-MM (condition B) 24 as a coupling reagent was moderate to give 5c in 37% yield over 2 steps (entry 3). In an attempt to improve the chemical yields for the coupling reaction of cinnamic acid derivative and amines, we knew that HATU or DMT-MM as the coupling reagents were useful in preliminary studies. For this reason, a series of cinnamoyl derivatives (5d, 5f-o) were also prepared under identical conditions at moderate yields (entries 6-15). In addition, acylation of 4a with benzoyl chloride (condition C) was successfully performed to yield 5e without any problems (entry 5) ( Table 2 ). For the structure-activity relationship study of P 0 1 functionality of serine derivatives, we prepared the serine derivatives (3), (6a-o) and (7b-o) as depicted in Table 3 . Acylation of the substrates (5a-o) was employed the Shiina 25 and Yamaguchi 26 conditions for the coupling of carboxylic acids or acyl chloride and acetic anhydride reagents. Using commercially available acyl chlorides and Ac 2 O as the acyl reagent gave the corresponding esters (3), (6c), (6d), (6g), (6h), (6i) and (6o) at moderate yields (entries 1, 4, 5, [8] [9] [10] 16) . Esterification of 5a with N-acetyl-L-histidine by the Shiina reagent NMBA/DMAP afforded the His-compound (6a) at an extremely low yield (entry 2). In this case, 2-nitro-6-methylbenzote as a by-product was given at a moderate yield and it was difficult to improve the chemical yield even after attempting several conditions. Preparation of a pGlu-compound (6b), isonicotine (6e) and nicotine (6j) also resulted in similar situations (entries 3, 6 and 11). The Yamaguchi protocol was performed to give 6f and 6k (entries 7 and 12) and also acyl chlorides prepared by 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzolic acid, 3-phenylpropanoic acid or cinnamic acid with oxalyl chloride in the presence of DMF in situ reacted with 5a to afford 6l, 6m and 6n at low yields (entries [13] [14] [15] . On the other hand, the treatment of a variety of alcohols (5b-o) with BzCl/Et 3 N/DMAP in CH 2 Cl 2 converted to benzoyl esters (7b-o). Chemical yields of benzoyl esters (7b-o) were variable by used substrates (entries 17-30) ( Table 3 ).",

The simulated compound (3) as a control exhibited an IC 50 value of 125 lM (entry 14). Since the IC 50 value of a previous reported peptide aldehyde (1) was reported to be 98 nM, imidazole of histidine or c-lactam of pyroglutamic acid were important functionalities. However 6a and 6b that had been coupled with 5a and His or pGlu showed low inhibitory activities as expected from the docking simulations (entries 2 and 3). For optimization of the P 0 1 functional group of 6, different acyl units; alkyl, phenyl and pyridyl groups, were examined. Aliphatic groups-containing compounds (6c), (6g) and (6h) showed lower inhibitory activities than 3 (entries 4, 8 and 9). Pyridyl derivatives (6e), (6j) and (6k) were also similar (entries 6, 11 and 12). Aromatic rings with nitro, chloride and methoxy groups (6f), (6i) and (6l) gave moderate results (entries 7, 10 and 13). Phenylacetate (6d) also showed lower inhibitory activity than 3 (entry 5). In contrast, conversion of the phenylpropionate or cinnnamoyl groups at a P 0 1 site would be expected to have a dramatic effect on inhibitory activity. Especially, the cinnamoyl compound (6n) showed potent inhibitory activity at an IC 50 value of 85 lM (entry 16 ). In addition, a 2-methyl-6-nitrophenyl derivative (6o) showed good potential as a 3CL protease inhibitor (entry 17). The IC 50 value Scheme 1. Virtual screening of the serine derivatives for SARS-CoV 3CL protease (PDB code 3AW1) on GOLD softwear. of saturated compound (6m) was decreased in comparison with those of the fixed unsaturated derivative (6n) (entry 15). These results suggest that serine type derivatives containing optimized functionalities would be useful as 3CL protease inhibitors. As the correlations between IC 50 and C log P, we could assume that 3, 6m, 6n and 6o with potent inhibitory activities tend relatively to have high lipophilicity with the C log P values of 4.82-5.28 (Table 4) . To achieve further optimization using a serine template, a structure activity relationship study of the P4 functionality (R 2 ) of a lead compound (3) was conducted. The aliphatic pivaloyl-containing compound (7b) substituted the cinnamoyl group of 3 showed no inhibitory activity and introduction of a phenyl-2-propenate (7c) and benzoyl group (7e) did not make a significant contribution (entries 1, 2 and 4). Next, modified cinnamoyl groups were designed because the moiety of the P4 site was replaced with the methoxy connecting cinnamoyl group to permit the moiety to fit into the S4 pocket more tightly than 3. Although each 2-or 3-methoxy functionalities were not effective (compounds 7d, 7f, entries 3 and 5), the inhibitors containing 3-and/or 4-methoxy groups on a phenyl ring at the P4 site exhibited markedly increased inhibitory activity (entries 6, 7 and 8). The IC 50 value of 7k was 74 lM and so the results suggested that a planar aromatic ring and its hydrophobic functionality were essential factors to produce a reasonable 3CL protease inhibitor (entry 10). The correlations between IC 50 and C log P are difficult to explain because these compounds are close in molecular formula (Table 5) .",

As a result, 7l and 7m showed no inhibitory activities. These compounds are shorter in terms of one carbon length of the P1 site than 3 and therefore the P1 position of the inhibitor showed decreased flexibility as expected and hardly fit the S1 pocket. On the other hand, aromatic benzyl amine (compound 7n) has a planer structure, which led to moderate inhibitory activity. Attempts to use cyclohexylmethylamine for 7o was acceptable to show IC 50 = 180 lM. It is suggested that the cyclohexyl structure at a P1 site strictly interacts with the hydrophobic S1 pocket.

The IC 50 values and tPSA of selected inhibitors are summarized in Table 6 . Preparation of D-serine derivatives was performed by synthetic protocols of the corresponding L-serine compounds without any problems. Fmoc-D-Ser(tBu)-OH as a starting material was selected and a 5 step sequence was performed as shown in Scheme 2. Interestingly, there were no extreme variants for IC 50 values between the L-and D-forms except for 6n (entry 6). Both enantiomers of 5a, 6a and 7l showed no inhibitory activities (entries 1, 2 and 3). The inhibitory activity of the L-forms of 6h, 7o, 6j, 7n, 6k and 6o showed a tendency to be more potent than those of the D-forms (entries 4, 5, 7-10). In contrast, 7i, 7h, 7j, 7k and 3, which exhibited potent inhibitory activities against the 3CL protease, tended to have D-forms with more potent activities than L-forms (entries [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . We guessed the enantiomers of 7i, 7h, 7j, 7k and 3 fitted the active site of 3CL protease via different binding modes, that is, the P 0 1 site functionalities interact with the S4 pocket and consequently P4 site groups located in the S 0 1 pocket. These serine derivatives have high flexibility and therefore two hydrophobic spaces of the 3CL protease are recognized in a rigorous manner. The enantiomer of 3 (ent-3) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 30 lM) in the evaluated compounds. Though there are no correlation between the IC 50 value and tPSA in Table 6 , these tPSA values were acceptable toward the protease inhibitor for the target of catalytic domain ( Table 6 ). The binding mode of 7k, ent-7k and ent-3 to SARS 3CL protease was predicted by docking simulations using GOLD from CCDC. These results suggest that reasonable inhibitors assessed by docking simulation can be designed and lead effectively to acceptable structures. Interestingly, the interactions between the enzyme and both enantiomers of serine derivatives were similar. In other words, the functionalities at the P 0 1, P1 and P4 sites of the D-serine template were located on the S 0 1, S1 and S4 pockets, respectively. This suggests the flexibility of backbones and recognition of the functionalities for serine type inhibitors. Therefore, the enantiomers of the designed compounds were also significant candidates as SARS 3CL protease inhibitors. Moreover, we may consider that D-serine plays a critical role in digestion by proteases (Fig. 2) .",

            "text": "It is important to have enzyme selectivity for the development of protease inhibitors. We investigated inhibition of cathepsin B, 27 which is a mammalian cysteine protease involved in numerous pathological processes. The cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 was hardly inhibited against SARS 3CL protease in our previous report. E-64, miraziridine A 28 and tokaramide A 29 were reasonable inhibitors to bind the active site of cathepsin B. For this reason, the inhibitors of SARS 3CL protease are thought to show specificity against endogenous protease. Therefore, we attempted to evaluate the inhibitory activity of the serine derivatives against cathepsin B. The inhibitory activity toward cathepsin B was determined with an assay using a Z-Arg-Arg-MCA substrate developed by Hiwasa et al. 30, 31 The inhibition potency of serine derivatives was screened for cathepsin B inhibition at 1.0 mM concentration and subsequently, the IC 50 values were determined only for the selected compounds. The reasonable inhibitors, 3, 7i, 7j, 7h and 7k and its enantiomers, for SARS 3CL R188I mutant protease and 6m, 7f and 7g, which had good potential as cathepsin B inhibitors, are shown in Table 7 . As a result, the serine derivatives that exhibited potent inhibitory activity against SARS 3CL protease showed relatively less potent inhibitory effects against cathepsin B activity and had high protease selectivity (entries 1-10). On the other hand, three compounds were extracted by the screening for a cathepsin B inhibitor (entries 11-13). These compounds were useless for SARS 3CL protease inhibition ( Table 7) . The inhibitory activities of selected serine derivatives, 6m, 7f and 7g, were evaluated using the corresponding IC 50 values. The IC 50 value of synthetic 7f was 170 lM. Comparing IC 50 values against SARS 3CL protease and cathepsin B, it was strongly suggested that the inhibitory activity is attributable mainly to the ester site of 7f. 32 The results are consistent with the structural data on 7f in a complex with cathepsin B, which suggests that the P1 site of 7f can easily adopt a conformation that is similar to the binding mode of E-64d. Although the P2 site had a rather weak effect compared with the P1 site, the inhibitory activity of 7f was about 10 times that of 3. To estimate the inhibitory mechanism, an inhibitory kinetics experiment with 7f was performed by making a Lineweaver-Burk plot. The rate of cleavage for different amounts of substrate by cathepsin B in the absence or presence of 7f (100, 500 lM) was monitored using Fluorescence spectrometer and consequently competitive inhibition toward cathepsin B was assessed.",

These inhibitors showed protease selectivity and no cytotoxicity and therefore a useful methodology using a serine template will facilitate drug design.
