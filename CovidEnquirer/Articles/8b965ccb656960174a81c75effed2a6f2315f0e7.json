In ICH patients, hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor for poor outcomes. Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used to reduce hematoma expansion. We analyzed the risk factors for hematoma expansion in ICH patients and compared the predictability of hematoma expansion in ICH patients with the use of tranexamic acid. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of ICH patients who underwent follow-up computed tomography scans from October 2008 to October 2018. Of the 329 included patients, 67 who received tranexamic acid and 262 who did not receive tranexamic acid were compared. We also analyzed the risk factors of 45 and 284 patients who did and did not experience hematoma expansion, respectively. Results: Hematoma expansion was observed in 7 (10.4%) of 67 patients in the tranexamic acid group and 38 (14.5%) of the 262 patients who did not receive tranexamic acid. There was no statistically significant difference between patients who did and did not received tranexamic acid (p=0.389). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for hematoma expansion, spot sign and a maximal diameter of 40 mm were identified as risk factors. Conclusion: We could not confirm the effect of tranexamic acid on hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Spot sign and the maximal diameter of hematomas were confirmed as risk factors of hematoma expansion. If the maximal diameter is greater than 40 mm, the hematoma should be closely monitored.",

It is a major health problem with an annual incidence of 10-30 per 100,000 individuals and accounts for 8-30% of total strokes. 23) Compared with ischemic stroke, ICH is a critical disease with 2-6 times higher mortality and morbidity. 12) According to reports, the 30-day mortality rate of ICH is 30-55% and only 12-39% of survivors have favorable functional outcomes after 6 months. 19, 24) In patients with ICH, hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor that causes poor outcomes and increasing mortality. 15 ) Therefore, prevention of hematoma enlargement is the goal of conservative management. However, except strict control of blood pressure (BP), it is not know how to prevent hematoma enlargement in ICH patients. 15, 18) According to several articles, the use of anti-fibrinolytic agents has been reported to reduce blood loss during surgery and prevent hematoma expansion. 1, 8, 11, 27, 32) However, unlike these promising findings, some related randomized controlled trial have shown that antifibrinolytic agents do not affect rebleeding, neurologic deterioration, and mortality for cerebral hemorrhage. 25, 29) In consideration of these discrepancies, we analyzed the risk factors for hematoma expansion in ICH patients and compared the predictability of hematoma expansion in ICH patients with the use of an anti-fibrinolytic agent.",

It serves as an antifibrinolytic by reversibly binding to 4 or 5 lysine receptor sites on plasminogen molecules. This binding completely blocks the interaction of plasminogen and plasmin with lysine residues on the surface of fibrin, thereby preventing proteolytic action of plasmin on fibrin and inhibiting fibrinolysis at the bleeding site. 10) With this mechanism, tranexamic acid has https://kjnt.org https://doi.org/10.13004/kjnt.2019.15.e23 been used for decades in multiple surgical disciplines for its ability to reduce intraoperative blood loss and the need for blood transfusions. 17) Evidence suggests that tranexamic acid may also reduce postoperative edema and ecchymosis. 21) Tranexamic acid also passes through the blood-brain barrier and may be effective in hemorrhage diseases, including intracranial hemorrhages. 29) In light of these concepts, some researchers have reported that tranexamic acid reduces rebleeding in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages (SAH); although it has been reported that thromboembolic events or delayed cerebral ischemia also increases. 8, 21) In addition, recent systemic reviews have reported that the use of tranexamic acid in patients with nontraumatic SAH reduces mortality; however, this finding was not statistically significant. 2) In another intracranial hemorrhage study, Sorimachi et al. 26) reported that the combination of rapid administration of tranexamic acid and strict BP control may prevent hematoma growth in patients with ICH. 22) To the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence to show the effect of tranexamic acid in ICH aside from this study. Recently, several well-designed clinical trials, including those evaluating TICH-2, have been planned and conducted, but they have not shown statistically satisfactory results including reduce hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes. 22,33) Therefore, our study investigated the effect of tranexamic acid on ICH in a way similar to Sorimachi's study. 27) Our results showed that there was no statistical significance in ICH patients with rapid administration of tranexamic acid and strict conservative management, but the rate of patients who experienced hematoma expansion was reduced (14.5% vs. 10.7%).",

Other previous studies identified hematoma volume as a predictor of hematoma expansion, 4, 9) however our study failed to concur, possibly because researchers did not directly calculate volume according to the CT slice thickness.
