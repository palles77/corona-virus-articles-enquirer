            "text": "In most of the proteins listed in Table I acylatlon was detected after labeling the protein with [~H]pulrnltie acid in the appropriate system followed by identification via immunoprecipitation, PAGE-analysis, chromatographic procedures, or combinations thereof. Although not examined in all acylproteins listed, in nearly all cases in which labeled fatty acids were analysed, palmitic acid was found to represent the major species bound to the acylprotein with stearic-and olei~ acid comprising the balance of total radioactive fatty acid recovered from the protein under study. The same ,esuits have also been reported from analysis of acyi chains released from non-labeled acylproteins purified in large scale (for references refer to Table I ). It should be noted that proteins modified by a 81ycolipid will incorporate 3H-labeled fatty acids during metabolic labeling, just like the acylproteins. In order to differentiate such glypiated proteins from acylproteins, labeling with [3H]ethanolamine or [3H]inositol should be applied. Only if such label is incorporated, is the prott:in most likely 81ypiated [3, 4] . The fatty acid linkage in th\u00a2,~ proteins is parlially or to:ally resistant to treatment with mild alkali of hydgoxylanfine. b Veil. M., Heftier. G. and Schmidt, MF.G.. unpublished data. Table I are glycosylated and represent membrane components with widely diverse biological functions. Among these are polypeptid~ which span the membrane once or multiple times. Usually the palmitoylated membrane proteins are oriented with their carboxyterminus towards th*. cytoplasmic side of the membrane or homologously towards the inside of the enveloped virus particles listed. However, reversely oriented proteins may also be palmitoylated, e.g., the hema881utininneuraminidase protein (HN) of mumps virus and of paramyxovirus SV5 [64, 65] as well as the transferrin receptor [14] . Some of the membrane proteins listeo occur as monomers [20] , others as homo-oligomers [11,631 or as hetero-oligomet~, An example for the latter is the insulin receptor, in which only the ~-subunit is palmitoylated [17, 18] . Beside the plasma membrane, internal membranes may also contain proteins with covalently linked fatty acid, e.g., the Golgi-located man. nosidase II and galactosyltransferase [29, 30] as well as the proteolipid component of sarcoplasmic Ca 2\u00f7-ATPase [7, 38] . Recent more generalized studies of the intracellular location of palmitoylated proteins showed that most of them are membrane bound [76] [77] [78] . However, the phenomenon is more complex in a functional sense, since a small group of palmitoylated proteins are secreted by the cells [ [65] (see below) all RNA-and DNA-viruses with a lipid envelope analysed so far contain at least one structural protein with covalently hound palmitic acid. These are all located in the viral envelope, and except for p 37 k of vaccinia virus [70] , are also glycosylated, it is noteworthy ~.hat viral spike proteins with a known low pH-dependent fusogenic activity are palmitoylated (see below).",

The results of such experiments revealed that palmitoylation of VSV G-protein and Sindbis El and F,2 occurs shortly after translation and just prior to the acquisition of Endo H resistance [102|. While various trimming inbibitors (swainsonin. deoxynojirimy\u00a2in, castanospermin) either had no effect on palmitoylation (McDowell, W. and Schmidt. M.F.G.. unpublished results) or led to a stimulation [103] . the effect of tonicamycin depended on the 8Jycopwtein under study. While tunicamycin had no effect on the acylation of the HLA invariant-chain [26] , coronavirus E2 [104, 105] and mannosidase l! [30] , it completely abolished palmitoylation of VSV G-protein [12] and of the sodium channel 122l. Thus. it seems that the influence of tunicamycin on acylation is an indirect one. pefltaps by preventing transport of the slycoprotein to the acylation site [106] .

By cell fractionation after extremely sh~ pulses (20 s) with [3H]palmitic acid in SFV infected bP.by hamster kidney cells (BHK), most of the [3H]palmitoylated F-protein was found in the rough ER fraction [111] . After establishing an in vitro system of acylation, which utilizes deacylated exogenous SFV E1acceptor protein [54] , particular membrane fractions could be tested for protein fatty acyltransferase (PAT). Studies with such a cell-free system using viral acceptors revealed the highest specific activity of PAT in the rough ER fraction [111] . The use of transport mutants revealed that early acylation occurs also with yeast cell giycoproteins [112] and different Ts-mutants of the influenza hemagglutin (Veit, M., SchmidL M.F.(3. and Klenk, H.D., unpublished results). Recently a chimeric construct between a fragment of the influenza hemagglutinin joined to the C-terminus of nearly compleie rat growth hormone was shown to be palmitoylated. Since this hybrid protein failed to be transported to the C-olgi apparatus, the authors concluded that fatty acid addition occurs in a fraction of the ER which they termed smoot ER cistemae [113] .",

However, with the two latter acylproteins autoacylation was observed [124,125,125a] , so that in these cases a different mechanism of fatty acid attachment may operate. Some non-enzymatic or autocatalytie acylation has also been observed with F_.2-protein in SFV-infected cells [112] . Such a process may not depend on cellular enzymes, but rather on the availability of acyl-CoA and a receptive conformation of the protein acceptor. The plasma membrane as a possible location for palmitoylation of cytoskeletal proteins resulted from studies with ankyrin in rabbit erythrocytes, which are devoid of nuclei and internal membranes [40, 126] . With plant cells, another compartment, the chloroplast, must have palmitoylating activity, since a number of thylakoidal proteins are acylated in that location both in vivo and in vitro (Ref. 58 and Mattoo, personal communication). Only a slight degree of palmitoylation was detected in the fungus Physarium polycep,~alum, but the location of the event was not identified. Interestingly, in this fungus most of the acylated proteins turned out to be myristoylated in amide linkages [127] .",

(2) Purified deac~lated and hydroxylamine free El-protein from Sen',:'iki Forest virus was used as exogenous acceptor for fatty acid. (3) Microsomal membranes from human placental tissue were identified as a rich source of protein fatty acyltransferase (PAT) (132b). Utilizing this powerful assay, the enzymological characterization of PAT as well as its protein chemical characterization are presently in progress. Initial results show that PAT is an enzyme of complex structure, which is bound to membranes of the rough ER (Schmidt, M.F.G. and Bums, G.IL, unpublished data).",

Since a variety of acyl species have been identified in different 'palmitoylated' acylproteins [65, 83, 135] , fatty acyk *ion into es',er-type linkage was not expected to be very ~l~'\u00a2ific with regard to the fatty acyl species. Nevertheless, comparison of acyI-CoA substrates with different chain lengths in cell-free acylation revealed a preference for palmitoyl-CoA [135] . Studies in our laboratory with enriched preparations of PAT revealed that palmitic acid (16:0) is preferred over shorter as well as longer aeyl chains. Likewise, unsaturated acyl species are less well incorporated into E1 acceptor protein when compared to the saturated species of the same chain length (Schmidt, M.P.G., Qanbar, R. and Burns, G.R.. unpublished data). %imilar results were recently reported for the acylation of the traasferrin receptor. In a study of acylalion of reticulocyte proteins in vivo and in vitro. Adam During several studies of acyi specificity of ester-type acylation of proteins by metabolic labeling, it has become apparent that the fatty acids utilized are subject to interconversion into other fatty acid species or to amino acids [65, 83, 135, 137] . Thus, if radioactivity from [3H]palmitic acid used for labeling is eventually detected in a given protein, this does not necessarily imply that pal, nitic acid is actually bound. A warning example for this feature is provided by the first report on the acylation of the RSV transforming protein pp60 ~\" with 'palmitic acid\" [138] . This acylation was later found to represent the highly specific myristoylation. Thus, the tiny fraction of myristic acid arising from interconversion [135] must have been selectively utilized for incorporation into ppr0 \"~ [139, 140] . Likewise, various viral or cellular acylproteins were labeled when normal and virus-infected cells were grown in the presence of [3H]myristic acid. Yet, when the pmified proteins were analysed for fatty acid [65, 135] , they contained mainly [3H]palmitic and [3Hlstearic acid. The extent of elongation and/or desaturafion of radioactive fatty acids duriog the labeling period was observed to vary considerably when different cell types were compared [831. Likewise, the spike glycoproteins of influenza C virus, after labeling with [~H]palmitic acid. were found to contain predominantly stearic acid (Veit, M., Herrler, O. ,'rod Schmidt, M.F.(3., unpublished data. It wil be of interest to determine whether the stn~cture of these proteins specifies selection for one acyl .~peeies ,~!8:0) or whether these particular proteins follow a different route of maturation. On such a new pathway they might encounter a new type of protein fatty acyltransferase. Alternatively, only restricted pools of acyI-CoA substrate may be available. Further development of cell free assa) systems for palmitoylation and their application with different protein acceptors will help clarify such issues.",

[141] sequenced the catalytic subunit of this kinase they found a blocking group at the N-terminus. Gas chromatographic and fast atom bombardment (FAB)-mass spectrometric analysis of peptides derived from the Nterminus revealed the presence of myristic acid in amide linkage to N-terminal glycine [141] . Shortly thereafter, and employing similar analytical procedures, two further proteins were found to contain N-terminal myristic acid, calcineurin (a Ca ~*-and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase [142] ) and the rough ER-Iocated NADH-cytochrome-/~ s reductase [143] . With the above-mentioned cellular acyl proteins and with the retroviral coded gag-protein p15 [144, 145] , an amide linkage between myristic acid and N.terminal glycine was established by analyzing non-labeled peptide material with a combination of biochemical [146] and the above-mentioned physical techniques. In all other and subsequent reports on myristoylated proteins (see below) a less sophisticated method was employed for identification. This involved metabolic labeling with [3H]myristic acid, PAGE analysis of cell lysates after immunoprecipitation, and (unfortunately not in all cases) fatty acid analysis after HCI-hydrolysis of the gel purified acylprotein. Table III lists all myristolyated proteins reported to date. It reveals that many of these polypeptides are [82, 147] , p56 [148] , p36 [149] , pp60 v ....

            "text": "The biochemistry of myristoylation has been studied in great detail by Gordon, Glaser, Towler and coworkers. These authors have recently achieved the purification of an enzyme from yeast cells, which transfers myristic acid onto synthetic octapeptide acceptors [163] [164] [165] . They designated this enzyme N-myristoyl transferase (NMT). It has been known for some time, that non-acylated proteins can be myristoylated in vivo once they contain the N-terminal region of myristoyiated proteins fused onto their N-terminus [166] [167] [168] [169] . By systematically altering the sequence of synthetic peptides homologous to the N-terminus of myristoylated cAMP-dependent protein kinase, it was possible to get some information on the substrate specificity of NMT in vitro. From their own results [170] , and from those reported by others [171] [172] [173] [174] , Towler and colleagues defined the structural requirements for Nmyristoylation in a recent review article. Accord:as to these data, a glycine residue at position I is an absolute requirement for the peptide to function as lipid acceptor. Proline or amino acids with bulky or charged side chains are not tolerated at positions 2 and 5, whereas a broad spectrum of amino acids is permitted at positions 3 and 4. Position 5 is occupied by serine in almost all myristoylated proteins identified so far. While Buss et al. [175] recently reported evidenc~e that the six aminoterminal amino acids of p60 ~'~ are sufficient for myristoylation, Kaplan et al. [176] find the requirement for a seventh amino acid with the same protein. They report that the seventh position should preferably be a lysine and must not be asparagine [176] . Both these reports utilize fusion proteins in which a short aminoterminal peptide from p60 s'\u00a2 extends the N-terminus of p21 r\"~ [175] or pyruvate kinase [176] . These data indicate that not all proteins with an N-terminal glycine will be subject to myristoylafion. In addition, there is evidence that even proteins with a 'good' recognition region for myristoylation may not be acylated. A prominent example for this is the GTP-binding protein transducin. Its N-terminus fulfills all the structural requirements described above and yet it fails to be myristoylated in vivo [153] . Surprisingly, synthetic peptides of this region of transducin become myristoylated in vitro [177] . It should be noted that prior to the attachment of myristate to the N-terminal glycine of a protein, the initiating methionine has to be cleaved. This cleavage occurs while the growing chain is still attached to the ribosome. It has been shown that NMT reveals no such proteolytic activity [165] , thus two enzymes must operate in concert to yield the myristoylated protein.",

This observation is in agreement with former studies on the chemical analysis of amide.linked fatty acids [133, [141] [142] [143] 147] and reveals a remarkable specificity of NMT for this rare fatty acid. In a recent comprehensive study (;lover et at. [178] confirmed this exclusive specificity for tetradecanoic acid during transfer in vitro.

This latter finding is compatible with the cotranslational attm,.hment of myristic acid after cleavage of the initiator methionine [180] . Myristoylation during translation had originally been shown by experiments in which myristoylation stops rapidly after addition of inhibitors of protein synthesis [10, 82, 83, 181] .

            "text": "Recently, it has been suggested that in macrophages a major substrate of protein kinase C becomes myristoylated after external stimulus with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1182, 183] . This implies that transfer of myristic acid to the 68 kDa target of protein kinase C occurs post-translationally, which is in clear contrast to the above-mentioned results. On the other hand, one of the reports by Aderem et al. [183] contains data indicating that Ireatment with inhibitors of protein synthesis prevznts myristoylalion of this protein. It seems, therefore, that LPS induces de novo synthesis of a myristoylated protein rather than the transfr of myristic acid onto a polypeptide, which has been translated before the stimulus. Alternatively, myristoylation of this particular target protein may be different from the well established N-terminal myristoylation. Future analysis of this substrate of protein kinase C will have to clarify whether myristic acid is really linked to the N-t~mlnus or to some internal lysinc or arginine.",

Involvement of protein bound fatty acid in the induction of membrane fusion is also supported by the fact that most acylated protein species found in enveloped RNA or DNA viruses are well known for their fusion-inducing property [189] . On the other hand, there are a few enveloped viruses which lack fatty acylated surface proteins and which are still able 1o enter their host cells by membrane fusion. Therefore acylproteins cannot be the only possible mediators of fusion [65, 79, 100] . To test the above hypothesis further, we are presently following an approach that utilizes the expression of mutated clones of the influenza hemagglutinin and of a paramyxovirus fusion protein both of which lack their fatty acid linkage sites (Veit, M., Klenk, H.-D. and Schmidt, M.F.G., unpublished data).",

The release of progeny virus particles was prevented by this antibiotic, although fatty acid-free glycoprotein was still transported to the cell surface, the location where new VSV particles assemble [87,1891. It is interesting to note that the maturation of viral spike glycoproteins includes an oligomerization step which yields, for instance, trimers in the case of the influenza hemagglutinin. It has recently been shown, by site-directed mutagenesis experiments, that this process requires the full membrane spanning segments of the respective glycoprotein (VSV G-protein, influenza HA) down to the carboxyterminns [192, 193] . A contribution. by hydrophobic interaction of fatty acids present in that area, to this process of trimerization is a likelihood. Experiments are under way to test this hypothesis (Veit, M., Schmidt, M.F.G. and Klenk, H.-D., unpublished; J. Kruppa, personal communication). Results which point to fatty acid involvement in protein-protein interactions have also been obtained with cellular acylproteins. When nicotinic acetylcholine receptor was synthesized without its fatty acids (i.e., in the presence of cerulenin) its five subunits failed to assemble to the heterooligomeric functional receptor [15] .",

            "text": "From the previous subsection it has become apparent that fatty acids do modify the physical properties of a protein. Therefore it seems reasonable to expect that an otherwise quite hydrophilic protein develops a general affinity for membranes once it is myristoylated. However, the surprise comes with the fact, that a number of myristoy~,ated proteins are associated specifically with the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane only, and not with any of the other intracellular membranes. The crucial involvement of N-terminal myristic acid in this specific interaction comes from a series of studies mainly with the transforming retroviral src-kinase (p60\"c). By replacing or deleting the amino-terminal glycine residue of this protein Kamps, Buss, Sefton and others were able to show that the mutated proteins are neither myristoylated nor membrane-bound. Furthermore, they show that the mutated molecules have lost their celltransforming abilities, although the protein's kinase activity is not affected [171, 172, [166] [167] [168] .",

In this case the recombinant mutant proteins failed to b\u00a2 transported to the membrane, and as a result the release of progeny virus particles was prevented [176, 177] . In related experiments, Pellman and co-workers showed that a 14 amino acid peptide derived from the Nterminus of the src-kinase can direct myristoylation and membrane binding of the non-myristoylated and soluble protein product of the fps-gene [169] . Analogous results have also been reported for hybrids between tl~ myristoylated N-terminus of p60 \"'~ and both p21 \"\u00b0\" [175] and pyruvate kinase [176] . On the basis of such data, it has been speculated that amide-bound myristic aicd is a transport signal, which can target polypeptides to the inner surface of the plasma membrane [173, 211] . At that location the myristoylated protein (e.g., p60 ~'c) is believed to interact with putative receptors for N-terminal myristic acid. Due to the specific topological positioning of this protein, its intrinsic kinase activity will ensure phosphorylation of the 'right' target protein [140, 1471 . Although this attractive hypothesis may be valid for myristoylated retroviral src-kinases, it is difficult to reconcile with the fact that some myristoylated proteins are either Soluble (e.g., cAMP-dependent protein kinase, [141] ), bound to the ER (e.g., cytochrome reductase, [147] ) or accumulate in the cell's nucleus (e.g., VP2 of polyoma viruses, [155] ). Two more exceptions need to be mentioned. While the myristoylated src-gene products of the transformation-defective mutants ts NY 68 [147] and NY 18-3 occur in the cytoplasm [212] , the avian src-gene product is not myristoylated at all, but is nevertheless located on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane [213] .",

On the basis of such comparative studies, myristoylation of structural proteins of tumor and other non-enveloped viruses was suggested to be important for intracellular transport of retroviral gag-proteins [174] and for the assembly process of different viruses [166, 119, 120, 170, 214] . In this respect, the report by Streuli and Griffin [155] is noteworthy. These authors found myritoylated VP2 protein in the nucleus of cells infected with polyma and SV40 virus. They suggest that myristoyl-VP2, while an:hored in the nuclear membrane, could position the newly made viral DNA for nucleation of capsid assembly [155] . Involvement in capsid packaging was also proposed for myristoyl chains bound to VP4 pro'ein of the RNA containing polio and foot and mouth disease virus [157, 158] . Although the myristoylated polio virus VP4 it packaged inside the capsid, it possibly participates in the entry of virus particles into the host cell. Since a cellular membrane has to be passed during this process, myristic acid linked to the amino terminus of VP4 could well serve a function similar to the one suggested for palmitoylated fusogenic proteins of enveloped viruses [215] . VP4 is the first protein to vanish during entry of this virus into the cell [216] [217] [218] , which may be indicative of its prime involvement in this crucial process. However, only future research will clarify whether a general mechanism for fusion-mediated entry of viruses into host cells operates in nature, which is enhanced by protein-bound fatty acids.",

Owing to a number of distinct biochemical features, two major types of this hydrophobic modification can be distinguished, palmitoylation and myristoylation. Both are enzymatic processes which covalently modify proteins mainly on internal cysteine and N-terminal 81ycine residues. Both types of aeylprotein occur in many different organisms as well as in many different intracellular locations. This fact and the sc, arcity of experiments ~vhich assess fatty acid function make it difficult at present to offer any unified theories on the biolosical function of palmhoylation or myristoylation. What emerges from the literature in this respect is perhaps that protein bound acyl chains contribute to a variety of different biological functions rather than to just on~ The unifying concept in all of these are the interaction of the covalently fir ked fatty acids with hydrophobic components present in their immediate environment. The dynamic nature of palmitoylation, which is mainly found in membrane glycoproteins, may mean that this modification plays a role in modulating the structure and function of the membrane spanning segments of such proteins, as for instance in signal tra.n.sd,_,,:_!i_on and mem.,brane fusion. The 'once and for ever\" myristoylation of a prolein seems to be mainly responsible for anchoring this \u2022 '.cylprotein to specific membrane locations, often to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Only in such a topological orientation can the myristoylated protein exert its function, which may be, \"or instance, to phosphorylate particular target proteins to initiate a cascade leading to various biological consequences. This is not the place to discuss the many exception from these two 'major' hypothetical functions of palmitoylation and myristoylation. It seems, once again nature does not follow our simplyfying ideas. However, with the recent purification of N-myristoyl transferase (NMT) and progress in the characlerization of the palmitoylating enzyme, protein fatty acyltransferase (PAT), we may soon be able to gain a deeper insight into this hydrophobic modification of proteins.",
