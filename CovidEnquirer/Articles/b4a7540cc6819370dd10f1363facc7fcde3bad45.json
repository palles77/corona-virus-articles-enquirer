Our previous studies have demonstrated that peptides derived from HR2 region could inhibit SARS-CoV entry. However, synthesis of these peptides is at high cost. In this study, we designed two recombinant proteins, one containing two HR1 and one HR2 peptides (denoted HR121), and the other consisting of two HR2 and one HR1 peptides (designated HR212). These two proteins could be easily purified with the low cost of production, exhibiting high stability and potent inhibitory activity on entry of the HIV/SARS pseudoviruses with IC 50 values of 4.13 and 0.95 lM, respectively. These features suggest that HR121 and HR212 can serve as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV entry.",

            "text": "are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses. The enveloped glycoproteins of the enveloped viruses initiate entry of viruses into their host cells by binding to cell surface receptors followed by conformation changes leading to membrane fusion and delivery of the genome in the cytoplasm [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . As for SARS-CoV, the fusion process is mediated by the spike protein on the surface of the virus [15] . The spike protein is a typical class I viral fusion protein just like the transmembrane glycoprotein of many other enveloped viruses [14, 16] . It is composed of two subunits: S1, a surface subunit that binds to the host cell surface receptor; and S2, a transmembrane subunit that ultimately inserts into the host cell membrane and promotes the fusion events. The S2 domain of the spike protein contains two helical regions, one near the amino terminus (HR1) and the other near the carboxy terminus (HR2), both of which are well conserved. In the late stages of membrane fusion, these two regions interact with each other in an antiparallel manner to form a trimer-of-hairpins that shares significant similarity with the fusion core structure of MHV spike protein and other viral fusion proteins [17] . This facilitates the juxtaposition of the virus and cell membranes, leading to membrane fusion. Moreover, peptides derived from HR2 region of the spike protein have been found to have inhibitory activity just as those of retrovirus and paramyxovirus fusion protein [18] [19] [20] [21] . HR2 peptides likely inhibit formation of the trimer-of-hairpins in a dominant-negative manner by binding to HR1 region just like T-20 (Fig. 1A) . T-20 is the first inhibitor to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission for the treatment of HIV infection in adults and children aged 6 years and older. However, one of the major limitations of T-20 is the difficulty of peptide synthesis, resulting in high cost of production and insufficiency of supplies [22] . Accordingly, it is necessary to find the analogs of these peptide inhibitors with the same fusion-inhibitory activity, but the production is at low cost.",

Based on our previous constructs, we designed two proteins, HR121 (HR1-HR2-HR1) and HR212 (HR2-HR1-HR2), analogous to HR1 and HR2, respectively. One more HR sequence was linked with 2-helix, which led to the formation of HR121 and HR212. In this study, we used a GST-fusion system to express HR121 and HR212 separately in an Escherichia coli (E. coli).

The structure forms a thermostable trimer of hairpins in which HR1 and HR2 are entirely helical and arranged in a six-helix bundle. We have made use of the 2-helix core as a scaffold to link another HR1 to its C terminus and another HR2 to its N terminus, respectively (Fig. 1C) .

Subsequently, chemical crosslinking demonstrated that HR121 and HR212 could indeed form trimer (Figs. 3C and D), although the monomer/dimer bands did not completely disappear even in high concentrations of the cross-linker. However, the density of the trimer band tended to get thicker with the gradual increase of the cross-linker concentrations. The molecular weight of the cross-linked trimer was around 38 kDa, close to the theoretical value. These gave strong evidence that both HR121 and HR212 could still assemble into six-helix bundle structures in PBS similar to that formed by 2-helix.

The ellipticities at 208 and 222 nm increased upon mixing HR121 and C38-30a (A), and mixing HR212 and N44-30a also increased the ellipticities at 208 and 222 nm (B). (C) The C38-30a was pulled down by GST-HR121. The results show that GST-HR121 could interact with C38-30a (lane 1), while GST-HR121 could not pull down N108-30a (lane 2); lane 3, purified GST-HR121; lane 4, purified C38-30a; lane 5, purified N108-30a; and lane M, protein markers (kDa). (D) GST-HR212 could interact with N108-30a (lane 1), while GST-HR212 could not pull down C38-30a (lane 2); lane 3, purified GST-HR212; lane 4, purified N108-30a; lane 5, purified C38-30a; and lane M, protein markers (kDa).",
