It is beyond the scope of this paper to describe the factors determining drug disposition in normal, healthy adults (Riviere, 1988a, b) . A working knowledge of these factors is, however, crucial in predicting the effects of age-induced differences in drug disposition. Only through an appreciation of these differences can drug and fluid therapy be individualized and the incidence of adverse drug reactions reduced in young animals. Generally, adverse drug reactions reflect plasma drug concentrations that have reached the toxic range. Occasionally, therapeutic failure results from genera-tion of plasma concentrations that are subtherapeutic. All four determinants of drug disposition (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) undergo dramatic changes as the puppy and kitten mature. The clinical significance of these sequelae varies (Table 3-1).",

            "text": "After oral administration, most drugs are absorbed from the small intestine. Because the surface area of the small intestine is large even in young animals, the extent of drug absorption probably does not differ clinically between young animals and adults. The rate of drug absorption tends to be slower in young animals, however, probably due to decreased gastric emptying and irregular intestinal motility. As a result, peak plasma drug concentrations may be lower. The decreased rate of absorption might actually protect against toxic drug concentrations (Heimann, 1980; Rane and Wilson, 1989) . These protective mechanisms may not, however, be present in puppies and kittens before absorption of colostrum. During this period, permeability of the intestinal mucosa is increased along with the rate and extent of drug absorption. Occasionally, drugs that normally are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (such as aminoglycosides, carbenicillin and 35 _... Toxicity to drugs distributed to fat other acid-sensitive 13-lactams, and enteric sulfonamides) can reach systemic circulation. Intestinal permeability decreases rapidly following the ingestion of colostrum (Gillette and Filkins, 1966) possibly due to endogenous release of hydrocortisone or adrenocorticotropic hormone. Exogenous supplementation of either of these hormones in the mother 24 hours before her giving birth prevents increased permeability and colostrum absorption in the neonate (Gillette and Filkins, 1966) . A number of other factors may alter drug absorption from the small intestine in puppies and kittens. Gastric pH is neutral in the newborn; adult levels are not reached until some time after birth, depending on the species (Gillette and Filkins, 1966; Heimann, 1980) . Increased gastric pH (achlorhydria) may decrease the absorption of many drugs that require disintegration and dissolution or are ionized in a less acidic environment (e.g., weak acids such as 13-lactam antimicrobials) (Gillette and Filkins, 1966; Rane and Wilson, 1989) . On the other hand, increased pH may facilitate absorption of weak bases that are generally not absorbed in adult animals (e.g., aminoglycosides). Milk diets can reduce absorption of some drugs by either decreasing gastric emptying or directly inter-acting with drugs. The \"unstirred water layer\" adjacent to the surface area of the mucosal cells is thicker in the neonate than the older animal and may limit the rate of absorption of some drugs (Heimann, 1980) . Until biliary function matures, the absorption of fat-soluble drugs (e.g., griseofulvin and fat-soluble vitamins) may be impaired. Microbial colonization of the gastrointestinal tract may alter response to antimicrobial drugs undergoing intestinal metabolism or enterohepatic circulation (jones, 1987; Morselli et al, 1983) .",

The rate of absorption after intramuscular administration will increase with age as muscle mass and its accompanying blood flow increase and as vasomotor responses mature (Morselli et al, 1983) . Because muscle mass is small in young animals, subcutaneous administration is frequently used. Again, variability in subcutaneous absorption rates can be anticipated with age. Less fat but more water may result in faster absorption in puppies and kittens compared with adults. Environmental temperature probably influences subcutaneous absorption, particularly in newborns whose thermoregulatory mechanisms are not fully functional (Shifrine et ai, 1973) . Cold environments are likely to reduce subcutaneous drug absorption if the neonate is not provided warmth. The same is true for the animal in a state of hypothermia. Subcutaneous and intramuscular drug absorption may be impaired until body temperature approximates the norm.",

            "text": "Several nontraditional routes of administration can be used in puppies and kittens. Intraperitoneal administration can be a lifesaving method of blood and fluid administration, particularly in the newborn with inaccessible central veins. Isotonic fluid solutions are absorbed rapidly, and up to 70% of red blood cells is absorbed within 48 to 72 hours (Authement et ai, 1987) . Blood and fluid solutions can also be administered into the medullary cavity of large bones (Authement et ai, 1987; Fiser, 1990) . Flow is the rate-limiting factor in intraosseous absorption. Factors such as the size of the medullary space, vascular tortuosity, sinusoidal pressure, and total venous cross-sectional area determine flow rate (Fiser, 1990; Schoffstall et ai, 1989) . Absorption of volatile anesthetic agents from the respiratory tract is rapid because minute ventilation is greater (Robinson, 1983) . Thus, young animals are more sensitive to the effects of gas anesthetic agents. Although percutaneous routes are not commonly used in drug administration, percutaneous absorption of drugs is likely to be greater in young animals. Percutaneous absorption is related directly to skin hydration, which is greatest in neonates. Topical administration of potentially toxic lipidsoluble drugs (e.g., hexachlorophene and organophosphates) should be avoided.",

            "text": "The most important factors contributing to differences in drug distribution in puppies and kittens are differences in body fluid compartments and binding of drug to serum proteins. Body fluid compartments undergo profound changes with the growth of the neonate. Both the percentage of total body water and the ratio of compartmental volumes change with maturation. The percentage of total body water decreases with age, but the decrease is more substantial in the extracellular than the intracellular compartment (Table 3 -2) (Sheng and Huggins, 1972) . Daily fluid requirements are greater in puppies and kittens in part because a larger proportion of their body weight is represented by water. The sequelae of these body compartment differences depend on the normal distribution of the drug. Most water-soluble drugs are distributed to extracellular fluids. As a result, in puppies and kittens, the volume of fluid to which these drugs are distributed is increased compared with adults; plasma drug concentrations will decrease correspondingly. A similar pattern would be expected for unbound lipidsoluble drugs because they tend to be dis- tributed to total body water. Changes in the half-life of each drug will parallel changes in distribution. Although decreased plasma drug concentrations resulting from increased distribution may protect the young animal from potentially toxic drug concentrations (Davis et al, 1973) , a poor therapeutic response may result from failure to generate therapeutic drug concentrations. 'The proportion of body fat is smaller in puppies and kittens. Thus the distribution of lipid-soluble drugs that accumulate in fat (such as organophosphates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and ultrashort thiobarbiturates) may be decreased proportionately. Although drug half-life decreases with the volume of tissues to which a drug is distributed, plasma drug concentrations may initially be toxic. Many lipid-soluble drugs have a high affinity for and are bound by plasma proteins, thus facilitating their movement through the body. Binding, however, limits their distribution from plasma to tissue. Predicting the distribution of highly protein-bound drugs is complicated. Serum concentrations of both serum albumin (the protein to which most drugs are bound) and a-glycoproteins (to which basic drugs preferentially bind) are decreased in the younger animals (Poffenbarger et al, 1990; Short, 1984) . Protein binding of drugs also may be reduced because of differences in albumin structure or because drugs compete with endogenous substrates (such as bilirubin) for binding sites (Ehrnebo et al, 1971; Rane and Wilson, 1989) . As drugs are displaced, the concentration of free, pharmacologically active drugs and the risk of adverse reactions increase. However, these changes are significant only if the drug is highly (i.e., more than 80%) protein bound and characterized by a small therapeutic index. While the concentration of free drug increases, that of total drug in the plasma tends to decrease since unbound drug is free to distribute into tissue (Ehrnebo et al, 1971 ). Consequently, drug half-life may increase, and longer dosing intervals may be indicated for potentially toxic drugs. Differences in regional blood flow to the organs might cause clinically important changes in drug disposition in puppies and kittens. Differences in intraorgan distribution (e.g., renal blood flow) may cause clinically important differences in drug disposition ). Blood flow to vesselrich tissues of the body (i.e., the heart and brain) is greater and faster (Robinson, 1983) ; the puppy and kitten are, thus, more susceptible to drug-induced cardiac and central nervous sys-tem toxic conditions. The potential for central nervous system poisoning is increased further because the blood-brain barrier is poorly developed immediately after birth. Increased permeability is a protective mechanism to the brain. Deficiency of nutritional fuels in stressful states (e.g., hypoglycemia, hypoxia, and acidosis) is prevented by allowing the movement of oxidizable substrates such as lactate into brain cells (Hellmann et ai, 1982) . Drugs normally incapable of reaching the adult brain are also, however, able to reach brain cells that are very susceptible to their effects.",

In contrast to that in infants, hepatic metabolism of drugs is incompetent in the near-term and neonatal puppy (Inman and Yeary, 1971; Reiche, 1983) . Both phase I (e.g., oxidative) and phase II (e.g., glucuronidation) reactions are reduced. The various pathways of metabolism mature at different rates. Progressive increases in phase I activity do not occur until day 25, and adult levels are not attained until 135 days postpartum. Generally, decreased hepatic drug metabolism is reflected in decreased plasma clearance, increased plasma half-life, and potentially toxic plasma drug concentrations. Dose reduction or prolongation of intervals may be indicated for some drugs (Table 3 -3). Oral bioavailability of drugs characterized by significant first-pass metabolism in adults (e.g., propranolol) will probably be greater in puppies and kittens. Response to prodrugs-such as primidone, prednisone, and, potentially, methylprednisolone-may be reduced because of decreased formation of active drug products. Hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes can be induced by phenobarbital and other drugs (Peters et al, 1971; Rane and Wilson, 1989 ). Phenobarbital has been used therapeutically to stimulate drug elimination in fetal or neonatal human infants (Sjoqvist, 1985) . Nonhepatic drug metabolism, which also tends to be deficient in puppies and kittens, is important for the elimination of some drugs. Lower plasma cholinesterase levels can result in increased sensitivity to organophosphates, succinylcholine, and procaine (Robinson, 1983) .",

            "text": "The sequelae of developmental changes in pediatric renal function include decreased clearance and prolonged half-life of drugs (primarily water-soluble drugs) excreted by the kidneys. Such a pattern has been shown for several drugs (Table 3- 4) . The effects of renal maturation on drug disposition can be complex. For example, serum gentamicin half-life was twice as long in 10-day-old puppies (80 minutes) as in 20-dayold puppies (45 minutes). Tubular damage does not, however, begin to occur until 20 days of age despite tubular accumulation of gentamicin, excreted parent drugs and products of phase II drug metabolism. Glomerular filtration rate and tubular secretion increase sevenfold and fourfold, respectively, from day 2 to day 77 in puppies. These increases presumably reflect an increase in the permeability of the filtration apparatus. In human infants, renal clearance of a 15,000-molecular weight dextran is essentially zero compared with a 90% clearance in adults (Dorrestein et aI, 1986) . Changes in renal blood flow parallel those of nephron maturation (Cowan et ai, 1980) . Although the number of glomeruli remains constant throughout development, both glomerular filtration and renal tubular function progressively increase (Cowan et al, 1980; ). The distribution of maturing nephrons also changes with age in the puppy ). Morphologically, renal maturation follows a centrifugal pattern such that the most mature nephrons are located at the corticomedullary junction and the youngest in the subcapsular layer. Neither renal blood flow nor glomerular filtration rate increases appreciably until blood flow is redistributed to the cortices at 2 weeks of age (Cowan et al, 1980) . As kidneys mature in the puppy, the rate of tubular growth appears to exceed glomerular growth ). Glomerular-tubular balance of sodium and water is poorly developed in the neonate . In contrast to filtration and secretion, renal tubular resorption appears to be similar to that in adults as long which is similar to that in adults. The site of accumulation is primarily the inner cortex for the first 10 days of life and then the outer cortex as the cortical nephrons mature. A centrifugal pattern of nephron maturation in puppies appears to protect against gentamicin nephrotoxicity by ensuring that the outer cortical nephrons are probably protected from damage until maturation. Another difference in aminoglycoside toxicity in puppies and kittens is the lack of clinical indicators. Pathologic damage induced by gentamicin appears to be evidenced solely by histologic lesions. Plasma creatinine is normally decreased in pediatric individuals (Cowan et aI, 1980 ) and thus does not increase above normal in the presence of gentamicin nephrotoxicity. Changes in urine sediment, osmolarity, glucose, and protein are not evident even when tubular damage is marked at 30 days (Cowan et al, 1980) . Renal damage can occur in puppies and kittens treated with gentamicin at trough concentrations (0.21 j.Lg/ml) that are well below those recommended to avoid nephrotoxicity (2 ug/ml), This fact, and the observation that peak plasma gentamicin concentrations (4.92 ug/ml) are much lower in young animals at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg once daily compared with the recommended targets (10 j.Lg/ ml) generally achieved in adult dogs at lower doses (4 mglkg daily), suggest that a different dosing regimen should be used for aminoglycosides. Compared with current recommendations for adults, puppies may require a higher dose and longer interval for gentamicin administration. The gentamicin-dosing regimen for unhealthy puppies probably should be further modified because they are likely to be suffering from conditions that increase the potential for aminoglycosides-induced nephrotoxicity (e.g., dehydration). Further investigations are needed to establish safe yet effective doses of aminoglycosides for the puppy and kitten.",

            "text": "Unique differences in drug disposition predispose the near-term fetus and neonate to adverse drug reactions. The idea of absolute placental selectivity has been replaced with the realization that essentially all drugs administered to a pregnant animal will be transferred across the placenta regardless of the degree of intimacy between fetal and placental membranes (Levy, 1981; Welsch, 1982) . The response of the fetus and newborn to the individual drugs, however, varies for several reasons. Even the simplest pharmacokinetic representation of the maternal-fetal system is complex, being composed of at least three compartments: maternal, placental, and fetal. The pharmacokinetics of each compartment is determined, in tum, by its own rates of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (Krauer and Krauer, 1991; Welsch, 1982) . Furthermore, pregnancy is a dynamic state characterized by dramatic changes in placental and fetal growth and in the physiology of the pregnant animal. All pharmacokinetic processes change in concert with the progression of pregnancy. In addition, specific differences in placental drug transfer preclude extrapolation of information among species. Finally, the route of administration is also likely to determine the amount of placental transfer; routes that result in higher plasma peak concentrations (i.e., intravenous, intravenous infusion, and multiple dosing routes) are likely to expose the fetus to higher drug concentrations. Although many factors determine the rate and extent of drug transfer across the placenta, lipid solubility of the drug and a steep maternalfetal drug concentration gradient are probably the most important (Welsch, 1982) . In general, nonionized compounds with high lipid solubility cross rapidly, whereas drugs with little lipid solubility cross slowly (Malkinson and Gehlmann, 1977) . A number of drugs that are polar at physiologic pH can, however, cross the placenta rapidly. Differences in drug disposition compared with both pediatric animals and adults can lead to adverse reactions in the nearterm fetus receiving drugs through the placenta. Thus higher concentrations of unbound and pharmacologically active drugs can be anticipated because fetal protein is generally less than that in more mature animals. The anatomic peculiarities of fetal circulation-that is, bypasses of the fetal liver and lungs-result in higher concentrations of drugs reaching the heart and brain. Although fetal metabolism of drugs can contribute to the ultimate elimination of drugs in the human neonate, the amount of drug-metabolizing enzymes present in nearterm animals is negligible (Malkinson and Gehlmann, 1977) .",

Necrotic enterocolitis can be a complication of orally administered solutions (see \"Enteral Hyperalimentation,\" later) and intravenously administered hypertonic solutions (e.g., sodium bicarbonate). Clinical signs reflect gastric distention and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Vomitus may be bile stained; intestinal perforation can be a sequela.",

Most of the pertinent information in the veterinary literature is concerned with excretion of drugs in the milk of food animals; there appears to be no information for small animals. Studies in humans indicate that drugs diffuse into the milk from maternal circulation. Low molecular weight (less than 200), nonionized, highly lipid-soluble drugs that are minimally protein bound diffuse into the lactating mammary gland rapidly, whereas water-soluble drugs diffuse more slowly (Berlin, 1981) . The pI<. of a drug will largely determine its concentration in milk. Animal milk tends to be acidic compared with plasma pH. Thus, although a weakly basic drug may be nonionized in the plasma and thus more likely to diffuse into milk, it may become ionized and nondiffusible once in the milk. Such \"ion trapping\" can concentrate drugs in milk. The ratio of drug in milk to drug in plasma is predictable, being greater for weak bases and weak acids whose pK.s differ from the pH of milk by 2 pH units (minus 2 for acids and plus 2 for bases) (Rasmussen, 1971) . Generally, the amount of drug excreted in milk is less than 2% of the maternal dose (Berlin, 1981) . Greater concentrations can, however, be expected if a drug is administered to the mother intravenously, as an intravenous infusion or in multiple doses.",

Cardiovascular responses to anticholinergic and inotropic drugs are likely to be attenuated in the neonate. For example, increased heart rate after administration of [3adrenergic drugs (isoproterenol, dopamine, or dobutamine) does not reach adult levels until 9 to 10 weeks of age (Driscoll et al, 1979; Poffenbarger et al, 1990) . Immaturity of innervation has been cited as a cause of decreased response to atropine (Robinson, 1983) . The different components of the immune system mature at various ages (Poffenbarger et ai, 1990; Shifrine et ai, 1971) . The thymus undergoes a 200-fold increase in size during the first 12 weeks of life in puppies and is probably a major determinant of immunocompetence. Although a humoral response is evident at birth, only IgM is produced. Neonatal puppies generally respond poorly to strong antigens (Shifrine et ai, 1971 ). Thus, although puppies and kittens should not be expected to develop drug allergies, response to immunomodulators should be attenuated. In addition, immunoincompetence necessitates the use of bactericidal drugs.",

Sodium is cotransported with several substrates actively transported across the epithelium of the small intestine. Oral administration of sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, and glucose in a single solution is the sole method of hydration needed to maintain normal blood volume and electrolyte concentrations in human patients with cholera. The World Health Organization has formulated a solution consisting of (in mM per liter) 90 Na+, 20 K+, 30 HC0 3 -, 80 ci-, and 111 glucose (total osmolarity of 331) (Hirschhorn, 1982) . The solution is suitable for most cases of diarrhea in human patients regardless of cause, electrolyte status, hydration status (short of shock), or patient age. The only requirement is that the patient be sufficiently conscious to drink. If vomiting occurs, the patient is allowed to rest, and administration is reinstituted more slowly. Recent modifications of this recipe include the addition of organic nonelectrolytes, such as amino acids, particularly for secretory diarrhea (Wapnir et al, 1988 (Wapnir et al, , 1990 .",

Studies performed with newborn puppies have shown that a 9-hour fast is accompanied by reduced hepatic adenosine 5'triphosphate levels, suggesting that endogenous fuels are not capable of maintaining hepatic energy production. With a 24-hour fast, other oxidizable energy stores are depleted, total body metabolism decreases (Kliegrnan and Morton, Drug end Blood Component Thllrepy I 43 1987), and fuels available for cerebral metabolism are restricted (Kliegrnan et ai, 1983) . Cerebral hypoglycemia is considered (along with hypoxia, seizures, and acidosis) to be a major metabolic stress leading to the loss of autoregulation of cerebral blood flow (Anwar and Vannucci, 1988) . Although parenteral hyperalimentation is a well-described therapeutic means of maintaining nutrition in adult dogs and cats, little information is available regarding its application to the puppy and kitten. Pediatric humans require 80 to 130 calories/kg per day (Kerner and Sunshine, 1979) . Studies in humans have, however, shown that weight is gained if 60 to 88 calories/kg per day is provided in the form of glucose, amino acid, and lipid infusion (Kerner and Sunshine, 1979) .

In human infants, an infusion rate of 6 to 8 mglkg per minute should not be exceeded, particularly in low-birth-weight infants (Kerner and Sunshine, 1979) . Rebound hypoglycemia can occur if a glucose infusion is stopped suddenly; infusion should be reinitiated as soon as possible. As the infant develops a tolerance for glucose, amino acids can be added. The recommended amount of enteral amino acid supplementation for optimal growth in human infants is 2 to 9 glkg per day; a parenteral dose of 2 to 3 glkg per day can be well tolerated. Free amino acids are preferred to casein hydrolysates and are generally infused as 2.0% to 2.5% solutions (Ernst et ai, 1983) . As with glucose infusion, amino acid infusions should be initiated at a low concentration (l %) and gradually increased as the patient develops tolerance to 2.5 g/kg per day (Ernst et al, 1983) . The optimal amino acid mixture varies with the age of the human pediatric patient; it is likely that a similar variation exists for the puppy and kitten as hepatic enzymes mature. Hyperchloremia metabolic acidosis is recognized as a possible complication of amino acid infusion in human pediatric patients, particularly if synthetic preparations are administered. Although infusion of fat emulsion appears to be safe in human infants, decreased tolerance may occur in the premature infant as evidenced by increased serum triglycerides and free fatty acids. Term infants tolerate infusion much better. If the rate of infusion surpasses clearance, however, potential complications include altered pulmonary func-tion and \"overload\" characterized by hyperlipemia, fever, lethargy, liver damage, and coagulopathy. Visual inspection of plasma turbidity and measurement of serum triglycerides can be used to monitor the development of overload (Ernst et al, 1983) . Maintenance of sodium and potassium in human infants requires 2 to 3 mEq/kg per day (Ernst et al, 1983) . Requirements may be even greater in the neonate. Daily requirements of calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium on a kg basis are 14 mEq, 2mM, and 0.25 to 0.50 mEq, respectively. Vitamins generally can be supplemented by the administration of 1 ml of a multivitamin infusion product with the addition of folate (50 ug), vitamin B t 2 (50 ug), and vitamin K 1 (0.25 to 0.5 mg) (Ernst et al, 1983) .",

The amount of blood that can be safely withdrawn via the external jugular vein from a donor dog or cat is up to 22 ml/kg (10 millb) body weight every 2 to 3 weeks (Authement et ai, 1987; Greene, 1980; Potkay and Zinn, 1969) . This usually amounts to approximately 450 ml of blood taken from a large canine donor and 50 ml taken from a cat. Donors may be minimally restrained or sedated (Cotter, 1988a) and the venipuncture site surgically prepared. A hemostat is placed over the tubing of the plastic blood-collecting bag and is removed only after the external jugular vein has been entered. Venipuncture should be clean with rapid blood flow to minimize activation of platelets and clotting factors and to minimize tissue thromboplastin contamination (Authement et ai, 1987) . When the full blood volume is collected, the collecting tube is reclamped before the needle is removed from the external jugular vein. Direct pressure should be applied over the collection site for 5 to 10 minutes after collection of blood for hemostasis. Some cats appear pale after blood collection, probably as a result of a combination of hypovolemia and sedation (Cotter, 1988a) . For this reason, an intravenous infusion of 100 ml of lactated Ringer's solution is given to donor cats immediately after blood is drawn (Bucheler and Cotter, 1993) . This infusion is usually not necessary for most donor dogs.",

Hemolytic reactions result from incompatible red blood cells given to a recipient that has developed antibodies from prior sensitization or transfusion. Type B cats generally have strong preformed anti-A antibodies and can react by hemolysis to the first transfusion (Cotter, 1988b; Bucheler, 1997) . Most hemolytic reactions in dogs are delayed and are evident only because of shorter red blood cell survival after transfusion and the development of a positive result to a direct Coombs' test (Tangner, 1982) . These reactions can be prevented by blood typing donor dogs, using donors that are negative for DEA 1.1 and DEA 1.2, and performing crossmatching for recipients that have received prior transfusions (Authement et ai, 1987) . Hemolysis can also occur as a result of overheating or freezing of blood components; concurrent administration of hypotonic solutions; mechanical damage of red blood cells caused by use of faulty equipment during collection, storage, and administration; or infusion under pressure through a small-bore needle or catheter or a plugged filter (Cotter, 1988b) .",

Individuals that lack a blood type may have naturally occurring antibodies or may generate antibodies on exposure to the antigens. Since the early 1950s, researchers have described two major feline blood types known as A and B.

The rare blood type AB could be explained by the action of a third allele at the same gene locus that is recessive to A and dominant over B (Griot-Wenk et al, 1996 Berlin, 1990. square root of the frequency of type B cats. In Persians, 24% of which have type B blood, the gene frequency of B (0.49) is nearly equal to the frequency of A. In British short-haired cats, the frequency of the B allele is higher (0.77) (Bucheler, 1990) . Because of breeding practices and chance events, the B allele frequency may vary greatly between catteries, purebred lines, and parts of the world. Because all tested type B cats have strong naturally occurring alloantibodies, fatal neonatal isoerythrolysis can occur in type A offspring of type B queens bred to type A males (Bucheler and Giger, 1993) . Matings of two type B cats will produce only type B offspring. If the father has the genotype AA, all of the offspring are heterozygous (AB) and at risk for developing neonatal isoerythrolysis.

Transfusion of type A cells simply adds more vulnerable cells to the milieu that are destroyed by the maternal colostral antibodies, further compounding secondary complications. The ideal blood donor would be the queen as she obviously will not react with her own antibody. Severely anemic kittens may benefit from a transfusion of washed type B blood during the first 3 days of life, which may be administered by intraosseous transfusion (Giger, 1991) . A total of 2 to 3 ml of the queen's blood should be collected in ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid or heparin and centrifuged at 1000 RPM for 1 minute; the supernatant should then be discarded. The blood is restored to its previous volume with normal saline solution and again centrifuged.
