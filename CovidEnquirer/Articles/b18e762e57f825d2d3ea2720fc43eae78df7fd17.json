            "text": "The contribution of lactogenic antibody to the protection of piglets against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was evaluated. Pregnant multiparous sows and their litters were allocated to one of 3 treatment groups: Group 1-6 serum antibody-negative sows and a subset (n = 11) of their piglets. Group 2-8 serum antibody-positive sows and their 91 piglets. Piglets were orally inoculated with PEDV at 4 (Group 1) or 2 (Group 2) days of age. Group 3-2 PEDV serum antibody-negative sows and 22 piglets, provided a baseline for piglet survivability and growth rate. Piglets were monitored daily for clinical signs, body weight, and body temperature through day post-inoculation (DPI) 12 (Groups 2 and 3) or 14 (Group 1). Serum and mammary secretions were tested for PEDV IgG, IgA, and virus-neutralizing antibody. Feces were tested by PEDV real-time, reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR). Piglets on sows without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) anti-PEDV antibody showed significantly different responses to PEDV infection in virus shedding (p < 0.05), thermoregulation (p < 0.05), growth rate (p < 0.05), and survivability (p < 0.0001). Specifically, Group 1 piglets shed more virus on DPIs 1 to 5, were hypothermic at all sampling points except DPIs 9, 11, and 12, gained weight more slowly, and exhibited lower survivability than Group 2 piglets. Within Group 2 litters, significant differences were found in virus shedding (p < 0.05), and body temperature (p < 0.05), but not in piglet survival rate. The number of sows and litters in Group 2 was insufficient to derive the relationship between specific levels of lactogenic antibody (FFN, IgA, and IgG) and the amelioration of clinical effects. However, when combined with previous PEDV literature, it can be concluded that the optimal protection to piglets will be provided by dams able to deliver sufficient lactogenic immunity, both humoral and cellular, to their offspring.",

In neonatal piglets, PEDV can cause severe diarrhea and vomiting, thereby leading to dehydration, metabolic acidosis, and death (Pospischil et al., 2002; Pensaert, 1999) . Clinical outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea were first reported in 1971 in England, with its viral etiology determined in 1978 (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978; Wood, 1977) . Previously free of the virus, outbreaks of PEDV in North America were first reported in April 2013 (Alvarez et al., 2016; Stevenson et al., 2013) . Spreading rapidly across the continent, PEDV caused a 6-7% decline in U.S. pork production in 2014 (Alvarez et al., 2015) .",

In piglets, the greater severity of PEDV is the result of slower villus-epithelial repopulation and the immaturity of the neonatal immune system Madson et al., 2014; Moon, 1971; Shibata et al., 2000) . Thus, the introduction of PEDV into a na\u00efve swine farm can result in !90% mortality in piglets less than 2 weeks of age and up to 40% mortality in 2-to 4-week-old pigs (Stevenson et al., 2013) . PEDV has also been reported to impact reproductive performance in pregnant gilts and sows. Olanratmanee et al. (2010) reported a 12.6% decrease in the farrowing rate, 5.7% increase in the rate returns, a 1.3% increase in the abortion rate, and a 2.0% increase in mummified fetuses per litter following an outbreak of PEDV in a large production system.",

            "text": "In the field, it has been observed that prior exposure of the sow herd to PEDV ameliorates the impact of PEDV infection in neonates, presumably via maternal immune mechanisms . Based on these observations, it has been postulated that PEDV-specific IgG and IgA in colostrum and milk are critical for the protection of neonatal piglets against PEDV (Chattha et al., 2015; Song et al., 2015) . Using TGEV as a model, the assumption is that lactogenic immunity against PEDV is induced by enteric infection following oral exposure . Thereafter, IgA plasmablasts stimulated in the sow's gut migrate to the intestinal lamina propria and then to the mammary glands where they produce PEDV-specific IgA (Bohl et al., 1972a; Saif et al., 1972) . Lactogenic IgA is effective within the intestinal tract of the neonatal pig because it has high affinity and is resistant to proteolysis (Song et al., 2015) . However, as discussed by Langel et al. (2016) , there are no published reports on the role of lactogenic antibody in the protection of piglets against PEDV. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to quantify the effect of lactogenic immunity in PEDV-inoculated piglets by comparing viral shedding, piglet growth, thermoregulation, and survival in litters with PEDV-immune vs na\u00efve dams.",

The inoculum used in this study was the 7th passage of the virus on cell culture. For this study, the virus was serially propagated on Vero cells (African green monkey kidney) in flasks using methods described elsewhere (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Chen et al., 2014) . In brief, Vero cells (ATCC 1 CCL-81 TM , American type culture collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in 25 cm 2 flasks (Corning 1 , Corning, NY) using maintenance medium (minimum essential medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies), 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies), 10 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies), 10 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin (Sigma-Aldrich).

Flasks were incubated at 37 C with 5% CO 2 until cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed and then subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle (\u00c080 C).

Thus, peripheral blood mononuclear T-lymphocytes and peripheral B-lymphocytes in piglets that received colostral cells showed higher responses to mitogens compared to controls (Williams, 1993) . Research on the role of colostral immune cells in protecting piglets against coronaviruses is scant, but the transfer of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from adult pigs into neonates was shown to delay the onset of TGEV enteritis (Cepica and Derbyshire, 1984) . The effects of colostral immune cells were not accounted for in this study, but maternal CMI may have been contributed to the protection against PEDV infection observed in Group 2 suckling pigs.",

            "text": "In late pregnancy, coinciding with high progesterone and low estrogen levels, binding of the IgG1 heavy chain by Fcg receptors on mammary epithelial cells promotes the selective transport of IgG from serum into mammary secretions (Butler, 1998; Chamley et al., 1973; Hammer and Mossmann, 1978; Killian et al., 1973; Porter et al., 1988; Schnulle and Hurley, 2003; Watson, 1980) . Postpartum, lower serum progesterone and higher serum corticoid and prolactin levels induce milk production and suppress colostrum production (Banchero et al., 2006; Delouis, 1978; Hartmann and Prosser, 1984) . This switch coincides with lower IgG and higher IgA concentrations in mammary secretions (Ash and Heap, 1975; Devillers et al., 2004a Devillers et al., , 2004b Foisnet et al., 2010) . After parturition, lactogenic immunity predominantly involves secretory IgA (S-IgA) produced from plasma cells in mammary gland tissues. Beginning shortly before parturition and continuing throughout lactation, IgA plasma cells preferentially migrate from mesenteric lymph nodes to the mammary glands (Roux et al., 1977) . Mammary gland lymphocyte accumulation differs between gilts and sow, i.e. multiparous sows have more mammary tissue and are able to accumulate more plasma cells than primiparous females (Bischof et al., 1994; Sordillo et al., 1997; Sordillo and Streicher, 2002) . Therefore, sows produce higher concentrations of S-IgA in mammary secretions (Cabrera et al., 2012; Klobasa et al., 1986) . Like S-IgA, secretory IgM (S-IgM) is produced from IgM plasma cells in mammary gland tissues (Sordillo et al., 1997) , but the mechanisms that regulates S-IgM plasma cell localization postpartum are not clear. (Note that multiparous sows were used in this study).",

Thus, parenteral immunization of sows with modified-live TGEV vaccines increased IgG in colostrum, but not IgA (Saif and Jackwood, 1990; Bohl et al., 1972a; Saif et al., 1972) . Following enteric infection, IgA plasmablasts migrate to the mammary glands where they contribute S-IgA to milk and colostrum (Bohl et al., 1972a; Roux et al., 1977) . Bohl et al. (1972b) found that sows orally inoculated with virulent TGEV produced high titers of S-IgA in mammary secretions and protected their piglets against the clinical effects of TGEV, whereas highly attenuated oral TGEV vaccines resulted in lower S-IgA antibody titers in mammary secretions and inadequate lactogenic immunity in suckling piglets (Jackwood et al., 1995; Moxley and Olson, 1989; Saif, 1999a Saif, , 1999b . Thus, amongst the PEDV immune sows (group 2) used in this study, sows were previously exposed to PEDV orally through feed-back. Notably, significant differences were found among litters from PEDV-immune dams in the quantity of virus shedding (p < 0.05) and return to normal body temperature (p < 0.05), but not in piglet survival rate. Although these differences were detected, it was not possible to assign a causal role to antibody isotype or concentration in mammary secretions because of sample size. In addition, some potentially contributing factors were not accounted for, e.g., the amount of colostrum or milk consumed by each pig and the role of CMI. Given that the ultimate goal of this line of research is to provide specific guidelines for monitoring and maintaining lactogenic immunity against PEDV infection in sow herds, these remain important topics for future research.",

Upon reaching the luminal side of the epithelial cell, the pIgR molecule is enzymatically cleaved; a process that leaves a receptor fragment (\"secretory component\") attached to the immunoglobulin molecule (Hunziker and Kraehenbuhl, 1998) . The secretory component functions to protect the hinge region of S-IgA and S-IgM from protease cleavage, thereby extending their stability on mucosal surfaces (Hurley and Theil, 2011) . The concentration of S-IgA and S-IgM in milk is dependent upon the rate of transportation across epithelial cells, but the rate of transport is dependent upon the expression of pIgR on mammary epithelial cells, which is under the control of hormones responsible for the initiation of lactation (Rosato et al., 1995; Scicchitano et al., 1986; Sheldrake et al., 1984) . In sows, the hormonal regulation of the expression of pIgR on mammary epithelial cells has not been described, although it is known that pIgR density is highest from 0 to 3 days postpartum (Schnulle and Hurley, 2003) .",

This is relevant because the sows in this study were induced to farrow using dinoprost tromethamine (Lutalyse 1 ), a tromethamine salt of prostaglandin F2 alpha, on day 113 of gestation. It is possible that this procedure may have impacted the concentration and total quantity of colostral antibody. Although the results of this study showed that induction of sows did not affect the overall capacity of lactogenic humoral immunity to protect piglets against PEDV, this may be a consideration in the field when optimization of herd immunity against PEDV is an objective.",

Before gut closure, enterocytes of the immature neonatal intestinal epithelium retain the ability to pinocytose immunoglobulins in the lumen of the intestine. Immunoglobulines are released in the lamina propria, and then diffuse to the intestinal lymphatic system, from where they enter the circulatory system (Moog, 1979; Murata and Namioka, 1977; Bush and Staley, 1980) . Some absorbed maternal IgM, IgA, and IgG undergo transudation through the epithelial cells to reach the intestinal mucosal surfaces, where they play a major role in protecting neonates against enteric pathogens, e.g., TGEV and rotavirus (Bohl et al., 1972b; Saif et al., 1972; Saif, 1999a; Ward, 1996) . In addition, IgG appears in the neonatal circulatory system within 48 h after birth Porter et al., 1988; Watson, 1980) . Depending on the sow's antibody profile, circulating maternal IgG can ameliorate the clinical effects of systemic infections, e.g., porcine parvovirus, porcine circovirus, and (Langel et al., 2016; Ostanello et al., 2005) . Using a passive antibody model, Poonsuk et al. (2016) found that PEDV-inoculated neonates with circulating anti-PEDV antibodies returned to normal body temperature earlier and exhibited higher survivability compared to piglets without PEDV antibody. Although circulating antibody did not neutralize the negative effects of PEDV on growth nor reduce shedding of PEDV in feces, the results implied that colostral IgG contributed to the protection of neonates against PEDV.",
