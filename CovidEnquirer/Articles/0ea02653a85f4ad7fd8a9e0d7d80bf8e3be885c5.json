            "text": "Mucosal surfaces are common sites of pathogen colonization/entry. Effective mucosal immunity by vaccination should provide protection at this primary infection site. Our aim was to develop a new vaccination strategy that elicits a mucosal immune response. A new strain of Enterococcus faecium, a non pathogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with strong cell adhesion ability, was identified and used as a vaccine vector to deliver two model antigens. Specifically, sigma () C protein of avian reovirus (ARV), a functional homolog of mammalian reovirus 1 protein and responsible for M-cell targeting, was administered together with a subfragment of the spike protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Next, the effect of immunization route on the immune response was assessed by delivering the antigens via the LAB strain. Intranasal (IN) immunization induced stronger humoral responses than intragastic (IG) immunization. IN immunization produced antigen specific IgA both systemically and in the lungs. A higher IgA titer was induced by the LAB with ARV C protein attached. Moreover, the serum of mice immunized with LAB displaying divalent antigens had much stronger immune reactivity against ARV C protein compared to IBV-S1. Our results indicate that ARV C protein delivered by LAB via the IN route elicits strong mucosal immunity. A needle-free delivery approach is a convenient and cost effective method of vaccine administration, especially for respiratory infections in economic animals. Furthermore, ARV C, a strong immunogen of ARV, may be able to serve as an immunoenhancer for other vaccines, especially avian vaccines.",

            "text": "Vaccine strategies that target mucosal immunity have many advantages; these include the capacity to elicit both systemic and mucosal immune responses together with improved accessibility, safety, and cost-effectiveness because the delivery is needle-free [4] . Several lines of evidence have indicated that induction of adequate mucosal protective immune response requires the aid of adjuvants. At present, the most effective mucosal adjuvants are Cholera toxin and Escherichia coli lymphotoxin [5] ; however, considering their potential toxicity, these bacterial toxins are not acceptable for clinic use [6] . Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which are generally classified as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) organisms, are traditionally used in the food industry. Recently, the potential application of LAB as vehicles for the expression and delivery of model antigens to mucosal surfaces has been extensively investigated [7] [8] [9] [10] . Bermudez-Humaran et al., showed that mice intranasally administered with Lactococci lactis (LL), having the E7 antigen of human papillomavirus type 16 (LL-E7) anchored to the cells together with the secretory form of interleukine-12 (LL-IL-12), induced an E7-specific immune response and provided therapeutic effects [7, 8] . Cortes-Perez has further demonstrated that simultaneous immunization of the LL-E7 and LL-IL-12 strains via the intranasal route is able to elicit higher specific immune responses and more potent anti-tumor effects than that via the intragastric route [11] . In addition, Mohamadzadeh et al., reported that co-culture with Lactobacillus promotes DC maturation and up-regulates expression of IL-12 and IL-18, but not IL-10. These results suggest that LAB regulate T cell responses and target them toward the T helper 1 pathway [12] . Hence, LAB strains act not only as a delivery vehicle, but also as an intrinsic adjuvant during vaccination. Nevertheless, the effect of LAB on immunomodulation may vary dependent with the LAB species or strain [13] . Thus the routes of immunization and differences in the intrinsic adjuvanticity of LAB strains need to be considered when planning an immunization strategy. In addition to Lactobacillus, the probiotic effect of Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) has been demonstrated [14] [15] [16] . It is worthy of noting that unlike most of LAB, the Enterococcus genus is not considered as \"GRAS\". For safety concern and to avoid antibiotic resistant gene transmission, a case-by-case evaluation of pathogenicity and antibiotics resistance profiles is required [17] .",

Sigma () C protein, a component of the outer capsid layer of the ARV, is responsible for attachment to the host cell membrane [21] and can induce high levels of type-specificity neutralization antibodies [22] . Structure-based sequence alignment of the ARV sigma C and mammalian reovirus (MRV) type 3 sigma 1 have indicated the presence of heptad repeats and a triple alpha-helical coiled-coil structure in N-terminal region [23] . In addition, crystallographic studies found that the carboxyterminal globular domain of ARV sigma C has a similar overall topology to that of MRV type 3 sigma 1. It has been shown that MRV sigma 1 protein recognizes the receptor of M cells (\u2423-2-3 linked sialic acid) that facilitates penetration of antigens into intestinal Peyer's patches [24] . Mishra et al. further reported that encapsulation of hepatitis B surface antigen by nanocarriers or liposome with Mcell targeting ligands (lectins, including Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1; UEA-1) promotes intestinal uptake by M-cells, enhances antibody production and increases cellular immune responses [25, 26] . As immunomodulation of ARV sigma C has not yet been reported, we investigated whether ARV sigma C protein has a similar effect as MRV sigma 1 on the enhancement of mucosal immunization.",

First, a construct AcmA -pET24a containing a fragment of the bacterial cell wall-binding protein AcmA was generated (Fig. 1A) . For direct observation of protein displayed on LAB by microscopy, a GFP coding region was inserted upstream of AcmA (Fig. 1B) . In addition immunogenic proteins of two avian viruses were used to evaluate the possibility of developing LAB as a divalent vaccine carrier. To do so, two PCR fragments containing the partial coding regions of viral envelope proteins, the Spike protein of IBV and the C protein of ARV, were amplified by PCR and cloned into AcmA -pET24a and the resulting plasmids were designated IBV-S1-AcmA -pET24a, and ARV-C-AcmA -pET24a, respectively ( Fig. 1C and D) .

Statistically, LAB anchored with antigens (IBV-S1 with or without ARV-C) delivered via the IN route induced a stronger mucosal immune response (indicated by IgA titer) than that via the IG route (p < 0.001, analyzed by one way ANOVA). Noticeably, in combination with ARV-C fusion protein, LAB was able to stimulate a higher antibody immune response than that LAB anchored with IBV-S-1 only or the mock LAB ( Fig. 6B and  D) ; almost all the mice immunized with ARV-C produced higher IgA titers than mice immunized by the other two regimens (mock LAB, LAB-IBV-S-1 alone) (p < 0.001).

However, potential side effects of live viral vectors and the toxicity of bioadjuvants have been a great concern; hence, alternative vaccines or vaccine strategies are warranted. This study presented a new vaccination strategy; we show for the first time that an avian reovirus (ARV) sigma C displayed onto lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is able to enhanced both systemic and mucosal immunity. To avoid the use of GMOs in any final application and to control the actual quantity of antigen in the vaccine, the heterologous proteins was expressed in E. coli and exogenously anchored on the LAB surface. To this end, autolysin AcmA protein that is capable of docking on the cell wall of Gram's positive bacteria such as LAB was used as a protein anchor [37] . In our studies, one copy of the first LysM motif domain was expressed to allow fusion via the C-terminal end of all the antigenic proteins. The estimated binding capacity was shown to be at least 40 g AcmA fusion protein bound to approximately 10 9 CFU of E. faecium, which is higher than a previously report (\u223c10 g of protein/2 \u00d7 10 9 cells) [28] . As all the antigenic proteins tested in this study were expressed and recovered from insoluble fraction, the high binding efficiency indicates that step-wise dialysis was able to restore the conformation of the AcmA protein to a great extent.",

            "text": "Previously Wu et al. has reported that conjugation of mammalian reovirus (MRV) recombinant sigma1 protein with a DNA vaccine enhanced antigen-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses when compared with naked DNA immunizations [38] . It has been suggested that sigma 1 acts as an M cell ligand that directs DNA vaccine to NALT M cells in the gut lumen and thus allows presentation to the gut mucosal inductive tissue that in turns induces mucosal immune responses [38] . ARV sigma C is a functional homologous protein of MRV sigma 1. Crystallographic studies of the partial ARV sigma C shows that the major receptor-binding domain resembles a globular head and features a triple beta-barrel and a fibrous extension of triple beta-spiral shaft domain [23] . When the crystal structures of ARV sigma C and MRV sigma 1 are superimposed, it reveals that head domains of these two proteins share a similar overall topology and the loops connecting the \u2424-strands are also very similar [23] . In the present study, the IBV-S specific antibody titre was significantly increased in mice immunized with IBV-S1 in combination with ARV sigma C compared to LAB monovalently conjugated with IBV-S1. Based on the structural similarities, it is reasonable to suspect that ARV sigma C may possibly interact with M cells and subsequently enhances the uptake and presentation of the antigen to the effective cells in lymphoid inductive tissue. At present, the cellular receptor of ARV remains unclear and the association of sigma C with M cells has not been proved. In our current model, the enhancement of IBV-specific antibody by LAB anchored two antigens might be not resulted from the M-cell targeting property mediated by ARV sigma C. In the gut loop assay, results of immunohistochemistry staining indicated that LAB adhered to M cells and epithelium cells, but such an interaction was not restricted to the presence of sigma C; LAB without sigma C also associated with M-cells (supplementary Fig. S1 ). Nevertheless, the possibility of M-cell targeting mediated by sigma C should further examined. As described previously that ARV sigma C is anchored into viral envelope as a homotrimer [39] , the recombinant ARV sigma C protein used in this study was prepared from a prokaryotic system that might not generate proteins with proper conformation. Hence, to define the M-cell targeting property, eukaryotic expression systems should be a better option. Moreover, it is also possible that ARV sigma C enhances humoral immune response by stimulation of cytokine expression. Indeed, our preliminary data showed that incubation of mouse RAW264.7 cells with LAB displaying ARV sigma C significantly increased expression of IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 that were not detected in cells treated with LAB control (supplementary Fig. S2 ). As IL-1 cytokines acting as adjuvants in the upregulation of humoral and cellular responses to antigen has been shown in several animal models such as in sheep [40] and chicken [41] . In addition, IL-6 has been shown to contribute to stimulation of IgA expression [42, 43] . It is likely that enhancement of humeral response by ARV sigma C in the mouse model is through stimulation of IL-1 cytokines. Nevertheless, the mechanism of immunostimulating can be complicated that requires further investigation.",

            "text": "The impact of vaccination route on stimulation of mucosal immunity by antigen-displayed LAB delivery systems has been demonstrated in the present study and others. Although LAB strains are natural inhabitants of the intestine, which is consistent with our findings, several reports have documented that immunization by a LAB delivery systems via the intranasal route is an more effective and elicits high levels of serum IgG and mucosal IgA against the target antigens when compared with the IG route [9, 11] . It is worth noting that with the IG route the antigen is displayed on the surface of the LAB where it is less protected when delivered without bicarbonate to neutralize the gastric acid. In such circumstances, instability of the antigen might affect the induction of the immune response. Very recently, in addition to NALT, Kim et al. identified another type of M cells with an antigen uptake function, namely respiratory M cells, which are present as a single-layer epithelium of turbinates in the murine nasal cavity [44] . As respiratory M cells are more abundant than NALT M cells and the uptake of insoluble antigen (Salmonella spp.) was found to be much more efficient than with NALT. This suggests that the respiratory M cells play a critical role in the gateway/barrier of the upper airway. Furthermore, it has been shown that among the various vaccination routes, nasal immunization is able to induce specific IgA as well as systemic IgG2a and IgG2b responses mediated by antigen-specific CD4 + Th2and Th1-type cells [45] . These findings support the idea that the intranasal immunization is a promising avenue for the uptake of bacteria-delivered vaccines and induction of both systemic and mucosal immunity.",
