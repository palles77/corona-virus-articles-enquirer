            "text": "Health is fundamentally a global issue. Recent outbreaks of Ebola virus disease and Middle East respiratory syndrome have reminded us that global health issues require collective action. The world must unite and countries must establish resilient and sustainable health systems, ensuring that each individual is secure and receives the highest attainable standard of health. Japan has been a longstanding advocate of human security 1 and has taken concrete action on the ground in support of this principle. Human security protects the vital core of all human lives in a way that enhances freedom, fulfi lment, and capabilities 1,2 and underlies Japan's policy of Proactive Contribution to Peace. Japan regards health as an indispensable element of human security. 1 In September, 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which includes universal health coverage (UHC), to which Japan attached great importance during the negotiation process. 3 Achieving UHC requires comprehensive changes to systems, human resources, and public awareness. To catalyse such changes, leaders must commit to leave no one behind in the drive for the best attainable health gains. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have created an opportunity to connect sectors and empower individuals, families, and communities. It is crucial that we agree on a monitoring and evaluation framework so that the impact of UHC against investment is measurable and thus attainable.",

In this context, we support the Global Health Security Agenda as a concrete mechanism to strengthen core country capacity stipulated in the IHR. Japan is well aware of the importance of the fi ght against communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, as well as addressing the challenge of antimicrobial resistance. 11 We reiterate the importance of the One Health approach in the fi ght against antimicrobial resistance, and of supporting countries to comply with the WHO Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, 11 as confi rmed at the G7 Elmau Summit.

Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of untreatable blindness in the world, and its prevalence is increasing. 1 Current therapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration aim to prevent growth of the abnormal retinal blood vessels that could leak and cause rapid visual loss in the later stages of the disease. This growth inhibition is achieved by regular injections into the eye of molecules that block the activity of vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 2 These drugs are expensive, and the requirement for regular and indefi nite intraocular injections puts a substantial strain on health-care resources. In The Lancet, Elizabeth Rakoczy and colleagues 3 present 1 year results from a phase 1 clinical trial to assess a single treatment, with gene therapy, as an alternative to regular injections for achieving long-term VEGF blockade. 3 Rakoczy and colleagues used an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to deliver the gene encoding soluble Fmsrelated tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1), a naturally occurring inhibitor of VEGF. A dose of 10\u00b9\u2070 vector genomes (vg) of rAAV.sFLT-1, increasing to 10\u00b9\u00b9 vg, was administered by a single injection under the peripheral retina (avoiding the central macula) in two groups of three patients, with two control patients receiving no treatment. The hypothesis was that transduced cells would produce suffi cient sFLT-1 protein to diff use into the vitreous and inactivate VEGF. 4 Treatment eff ects were assessed by a reduction in the need for further injections of the standard treatment (ranibizumab) and improvements in retinal anatomy during the 1 year study period. While there was no matched control group, comparisons with historical data from other studies were in keeping with a treatment eff ect from the procedure. There were no safety concerns, such as retinal ischaemia or atrophy of the retinal tissue, which have been a concern with prolonged anti-VEGF therapy. 5 Rakoczy and colleagues' trial is notable in exploring the use of gene therapy as a means of providing a socalled protein pump, which is particularly suited to the enclosed compartment of the eye. Although AAV gene therapy has shown promise for gene replacement in single-gene disorders, 6 the use of gene therapy to reprogramme genetically normal cells of the retina to take on additional functions opens a new chapter in potential AAV applications. One of the very fi rst trials of retinal gene therapy 7 also used a viral vector as a pharmacological method for the sustained delivery of a therapeutic protein to block VEGF in age-related macular degeneration. The key diff erence with respect to the current trial 3 is that the earlier study 7 used an adenoviral vector to deliver the VEGF antagonist, which was predicted to have only a temporary eff ect. AAV vectors, in contrast, have evolved to evade the host immune system and have shown evidence of indefi nite gene expression following human subretinal administration (fi gure). 8 Other anti-VEGF approaches in clinical trials include administration of the AAV vector directly into the vitreous cavity rather than into the subretinal space (NCT01024998). Intravitreal injections are easier to perform, but most probably a higher vector dose would be needed and there could be more off -target eff ects due to transduction of retinal ganglion cells and a greater risk of infl ammation. 9 The study by Rakoczy and colleagues 3 validates the subretinal approach. There are, however, outstanding questions, such as which",
