A comprehensive genetic analysis of the regulation of proteome of HDL isolated from a panel of 100 diverse inbred strains of mice, Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), revealed widely varied HDL protein levels across the strains. Some of this variation was explained by local, cis-acting regulation, termed cis-protein quantitative trait loci. Variations in apolipoprotein A-II and apolipoprotein C-3 affected the abundance of multiple HDL proteins indicating a coordinated regulation. We identified modules of co-varying proteins and define a protein-protein interaction network describing the protein composition of the naturally occurring subspecies of HDL in mice. Sterol efflux capacity varied up to 3-fold across the strains and HDL proteins displayed distinct correlation patterns with macrophage and ABCA1 specific cholesterol efflux capacity and cholesterol exchange, suggesting that subspecies of HDL participate in discrete functions. The baseline and stimulated sterol efflux capacity phenotypes associated with distinct QTLs with smaller effect size suggesting a multi genetic regulation. Our results highlight the complexity of HDL particles by revealing high degree of heterogeneity and intercorrelation, some of which is associated with functional variation, supporting the concept that HDL-cholesterol alone is not an accurate measure of HDL's properties such as protection against CAD.",

In humans, discrete classes of HDL based on size can be identified. In mice, HDL sizes are more continuous (LeBoeuf and Lusis, 1983 ) and represent one monodisperse peak. The size and levels of HDL vary in both human and mouse populations (Joshi et al., 2016; Pamir et al., 2016) . There are clear functional differences associated with the various size classes of HDL. In particular, the small lipid-poor particles are the best acceptors of cholesterol from cells and thus should be particularly important in mediating reverse cholesterol transport, whereas larger particles, associated with proteins such as paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and APOE, are likely to be important in protecting against inflammation. HDL particles containing proteins such as serum amyloid A (SAA) species tend to lack anti-inflammatory properties (Vaisar et al., 2015) . HDL-C levels have a skewed normal distribution in the general population, and the median levels vary by sex and ethnicity. Linkage based studies from the early 1980's have tried to identify the genetic factors that influence plasma HDL-C levels, but many findings have not been replicated due to polygenic nature of this trait, with contributions from multiple small-effect gene variants. Meta-analyses and GWAS results do, however, support the association of HDL-C with variation in CETP, LIPC, LPL, ABCA1, endothelial lipase (LIPG) and LCAT (Hegele, 2009; Thompson et al., 2008) . Multiple genetic factors could be present in an individual, creating a polygenic network of HDL-C determinants (Cohen et al., 2004) . These determinants include monogenic effectors, such rare homozygous mutations in ABCA1, LCAT, and APOA1 causing extremely low HDL-C (Brooks-Wilson et al., 1999; Kuivenhoven et al., 1996; Ng et al., 1994) , and rare homozygous mutations in CETP, LIPC, and SCARB1, causing extremely elevated HDL-C . The mouse models of these variants have been supportive of the human findings (Wang and Paigen, 2005) (Wang & Paigen, 2005) . Polygenic determinants have been recently investigated using targeted next-generation sequencing in patients with extremely low and high HDL-C. About 30% of individuals at the extremes of HDL-C had rare large effect and common small effect variants explaining the trait (Dron et al., 2017) . Whereas the genetic determinants of plasma HDL-C levels have been well studied, the genetic determinants of HDL proteome and lipidome have never been previously investigated.",

First, associations between SNPs and HDL protein levels and function were determined. Second, the effects of SNPs on gene regulation were determined by eQTL analysis using hepatic and adipose tissue-specific gene expression. Based on the genetic variation in HDL observed, we were able to identify numerous genetic factors mediating HDL composition and provide an approximation of the nature of the interactions between the proteins. Finally, we used protein-protein interaction cluster analyses to build an HDL model that describes the group of proteins that constitute the core proteins and the ones that are peripheral. We identified moderate QTLs associated with HDLs sterol efflux capacity. Our results reveal a great deal of heterogeneity and inter-correlation, some of which is of proteins that are acutely regulated by the environment (ie. Diet and inflammationhttp://homepages.uc.edu/~davidswm/HDLproteome.html). The H2 scores for such proteins are expected to be zero. Furthermore, due to our study design, the proteins that are strain specific are also expected to have a H2 of zero.",

Association analysis was performed using about 200,000 informative SNPs (Bennett et al., 2010) , spaced throughout the genome (Table 2 ). Hepatic transcript levels were from a previous survey of the HMDP maintained on the same chow diet as in this study (Bennett et al., 2010) . Loci averaged 500 kb to 2 Mb in size and in most cases contained 1 to 20 genes within a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block, an improvement of more than an order of magnitude as compared to traditional linkage analysis in mice (typically a resolution of 10 to 20 Mb) (Flint et al., 2005) . Loci mapping within 1Mb of the gene are termed \"local\" QTL, suggesting that they probably act in cis. For example, promoter or enhancer variants would act in cis. Loci mapping greater than 1Mb from the gene of interest are termed \"distal\", implying that they act in trans, presumably mediated by a diffusible factor such as a transcription factor (Table 2 and  Supplemental Table 2 ). We applied a significance filter of P=10 -3 and 10 -6 to identify suggestive cis and trans QTLs respectively.",

With the exception of Apoc3, all of the significant pQTL also exhibited significant eQTL, indicating that genetic variation in protein levels was largely due to regulation of gene expression. In the case of Apoc3, while there was no significant eQTL in liver, there was a highly significant eQTL in adipose tissue (P=1.8 x 10 -7 ) (Supplemental Table  3 ). Apoa2 and Saa2 exhibited much more significant pQTL than eQTL (P=1.324e-22, effect size = -0.413 vs. P=1.276e-4, effect size = 0.0210 for Apoa2, and P=2.559e-10, effect size = 0.0780 and P=1.533e-6, effect size = 0.780 for Saa2 respectively), suggesting that the pQTL were due to coding rather than regulatory variations. In the case of Apoa2, our previous studies indicated that structural variation affecting translation efficiency was largely responsible for the differences in protein levels among several common inbred strains (Bennett et al., 2010) . Also, common coding variants are present among the HMDP strains for both Apoe3 and Saa2 (www.informatics.jax.org). As shown in Table 2 , many variants significantly affecting HDL protein expression did not exhibit corresponding variations in protein levels. A likely explanation in the case of HDL is that, for some proteins, only a limited amount of the protein can be incorporated into the HDL lipid-protein complex, the remainder presumably being degraded.",

In contrast to local eQTL, where only SNPs within 1Mb of the gene are tested for association, distal QTL analyses involve genome wide SNP tests for association, requiring a much higher threshold for significance. A number of the likely significant distal eQTL occur with several Mb of the gene and, thus, probably result from either long range (>1 Mb) linkage disequilibrium or chromosome looping interactions (for example Apoh, Apom, B2m, H2-Q10, and Pp1c) (Supplemental Table 2 ). The pQTL analysis also identified some highly significant distal (trans-acting) interactions, most notably for Apoa2 (p=4.6 x 10 -14 ). The Apoa2 locus is about 5 Mb from the structural gene and the significant association is probably the result of linkage disequilibrium or chromosome looping.",

Further, proteins that participate in immune responses, including serum amyloids SAA1, SAA2, histocompatibility complexes H2-Q4 and H2-Q10 associated strongly and formed a distinct cluster with other immune response proteins CD97, C4BPA and APOE. All of the hemoglobin proteins, HBBA, HBB1, HBBT1 formed a distinct cluster. Lipid metabolism proteins, APOC1, APOA5, APOA4, PLTP, and GPLD1 clustered together. Most interestingly, APOC3 correlated negatively with 39 proteins on HDL. Among these were proteins with roles in immune response such as APOE, PON1, SAA1, SAA4 (Supplementary Table 5 ). insulin like growth factor binding protein, IGFALS clustered strongly but negatively with APOC3 (r=-0.53, P=0.002). Recent studies suggest a role for APOC3 in beta cell insulin resistance (\u00c5vall et al, 2015) and according to proteome interactome by Harmonizome (a tool curated from 100 public databases (Rouillard et al, 2016) ) APOC3 is one of the 73 proteins found to interact with IGFALS. We observed significant correlations between HDL-C levels and GM94, ITGB1, APOC1, APOC2 (positive) and APOA2, SERPINA1A, ALB, and TFRC (negative) regardless of PSM normalization method used (Supplemental Table 5 ). All the New Zealand strains studied (NZB BIN/J, NZW LAC/J, KKHI/J) were in the top quintile of HDL-C distribution and bottom quintile of APOA2 distribution.

Previous studies in mice have revealed genetic variations in the levels of HDL-cholesterol, HDL apoproteins, and HDL composition (Lusis et al., 1983) . Our results are consistent with a high level of heritability of HDL proteins, including the identification of a number of novel pQTLs. One significant conclusion that has emerged is that certain proteins cluster together in response to genetic perturbations, presumably reflecting physical or regulatory interactions. These clusters then help define the heterogeneity of HDL particles, although our analyses do not address lipid heterogeneity. Another important conclusion is evidence of a relationship between protein composition and HDL function. Finally, we have identified potential links between HDL proteins and various clinical or molecular traits studied previously in the HMDP strains. We discuss each of these points in turn below.",

            "text": "Normalization of shotgun proteomic data is a continuous struggle in the field (V\u00e4likangas et al., 2018) . HDL is a rather uncomplicated mixture containing only ~100 proteins. However, its proteome is driven by the 10 most abundant proteins, with 65% being made up of APOA1 and 15% of APOA2 (Toth et al., 2013) . The normalization strategy should conserve the compositional bias of the HDL. The normalization that directly adjusts scale such as Total Count (TC) and Upper Quartile (UQ) fails to accommodate compositional bias. The normalization strategies that adjust scales using landmarks in the distribution Median, (Med), Differentially expressed (DESeq), Trimmed mean (TMM) are promising approaches for HDL proteome however, detailed analyses need to be performed for their validation to be used on smaller libraries of stochastic count data from mass spectrometry. The quartile (Q) and reads per kilobase per million mapped (RPKM) (equivalent of normalizing spectral counts to protein length) have adverse effects on intra-sample variance and on distribution bias (Dillies et al., 2013) . The TC and UQ normalizations favor the most abundant proteins and are unfriendly for mixtures with a distribution bias. That said, TC normalization is often the preferred method for shotgun HDL proteomics as it controls for differences in instrument response, digestion efficiency, and amounts of loaded protein digest but fails at conserving the distribution bias as it tends to accommodate the changes in the abundant proteins (Vaisar et al., 2007) . That is partly why the HDL protein quantification by shotgun proteomics is not optimal and the correlation with immunobased assays are moderate (Hoofnagle et al., 2012) . Therefore, we opted to include a second normalization approach by spiking yeast carboxy peptidase at levels ~8 fold lower than APOA1 and to correspond to the median/mean abundance of the typical HDL proteome (Carvalho et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2004) . The QTLs identified using both proteomic information are mostly overlapping with TC normalization resulting in ~30% more significant QTLs. The relationships among inbred lines of mice was inferred from the high-density SNP map where strains cluster according to their genealogy (Cervino et al., 2005) . We employed the same approach: The 155 proteins that were present in at least 20% of the strains loosely predicted the relatedness of the strains according to their genealogy for inbred strains and according to the breeding scheme for recombinant strains . Almost half of these proteins (81) were present in greater than 80% of the strains and only 34 were shared by all the strains. The strain dependent distribution of HDL proteome across 93 strains validates our previous studies with only 5 strains (Pamir et al., 2016) . However, the comparison of the clustering patterns between microarray data or the SNPs did not reach full agreement as genetic variation explains only a fraction of the variation and a very small part of the genome is involved in regulating HDL (data not shown). The 93 strains are represented by N=1-5 with a distribution of ~4, 9, 75, 9, and 1 % for N=1,2,3,4, and 5 respectively. Even though, these N are not optimal to calculateintra and -inter strain variation, the broad sense heritability calculations captured 65 proteins that have greater than 10% heritability. Among which APOA2 has a score of 0.62 which is consistent with its strong association with HDL-C loci -a highly heritable trait.",

            "text": "The classic linear view of HDL genesis from discoidal, lipid-poor nascent particles to spherical, cholesterol-and phospholipid-rich particles packed with a combination of over 100 different proteins has been recently challenged by the finding that HDL is secreted directly from hepatocytes in 4 distinct sizes, with little interchange between them, and representing all of the plasma HDL subparticle pools (Mendivil et al., 2016) . Although our analyses do not incorporate the lipidome of HDL which can contribute to the orchestration of the composition of HDL sub populations, and our samples weren't stored with a cryoprotectant (HDL structure, function and proteome can be affected and proteome under represented (Holzer et al, 2017) a highly inter correlated proteome reveals the complexity of HDL particle composition. We captured a remarkable 2216 correlations among the proteins that survived multiple comparison correction and that explains at least 25% of the variation (R2>0.25). The hierarchical clustering of the correlated proteins regrouped the proteins according to their biological functions emphasizing the coordinated co-regulation. However, while applying the stringent statistical approach certain biological relationships were missed. For example, APOC3 significantly and exclusively negatively correlated with 36 other HDL proteins (Supplementary Table 2 ). In humans, }increased circulating APOC3 levels are associated with cardiovascular disorders, inflammation, and insulin resistance (Chan et al., 2008; Petersen et al., 2010) . On the other hand, humans with an APOC3 mutation benefit from a favorable lipoprotein profile, increased insulin sensitivity, lower incidence of hypertension, and protection against cardiovascular diseases (Atzmon et al., 2006; J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2014; Pollin et al., 2008) . The negative correlation of APOC3 with 36 other proteins, its association with plasma insulin levels, and HOMA-IR levels conforms to its newly appreciated role as a brake on the metabolic system. Efforts to identify the proteomic, lipidomic, and functional fingerprints of HDL subspecies are of critical importance and may open paths to novel pharmacological targets. Clinical and epidemiological studies show a robust, inverse association between HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and CHD risk (D. J. Gordon and Rifkind, 1989; Wilson et al., 1988) . However, pharmacological interventions aimed at raising HDL cholesterol levels in humans showed no cardiovascular benefits (AIM-HIGH Investigators et al., 2011; Barter et al., 2007; Landray et al., 2014; Schwartz et al., 2012) . Since the collapse of the HDL-C hypothesis for atherosclerosis, a new generation of HDL metrics are under investigation to be used in clinic (Fazio and Pamir, 2016) . For example, greater HDL cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), independent of levels of HDL-C and APOA1 (the major structural protein of HDL), is associated with a lower prevalence of atherosclerotic vascular disease (Khera et al., 2011; Li et al., 2013; Rohatgi et al., 2014) . Most changes in HDL function are likely to be a reflection of changes in the HDL proteome (Green et al., 2008; Vaisar et al., 2007) . Thus, identification of the protein signature responsible for loss of sterol efflux capacity could provide biomarkers of clinical validity to assess CHD risk. The interplay between HDL sterol efflux function, particle concentration, size and HDL proteome is still poorly understood. HDL-C levels correlated strongly with all the efflux measures. While we captured strong associations between expected metrics such as diffusional or ABCA1 specific efflux from two different cell types, no single HDL protein explained the majority of the variation in sterol efflux, suggesting that it is a polygenic process. That said, APOA2 explained about 10% of ABCA1 dependent sterol efflux from both cell types and the Apoa2 locus was strongly associated with ABCA1 specific sterol efflux (data not shown). In mice, APOA2 seems to impact the sterol efflux function at the protein and gene level. It is important to note that Apoa2 locus aligns with HDL-C QTL.",

We show that HDL proteins preserve hereditary patterns that are likely to harbor ancestral/lineage information. It is likely that inheritance controls the production of HDL particles of a certain protein and lipid composition that have different functions. At present, we lack a model for the assembly of HDL protein and lipid cargo. Our results provide the ground work to support future studies aimed at characterization of the genetic architecture regulating HDL function and comprehensive composition in humans.",

Mice were housed (1-3/cage) in a pathogen-free barrier facility (22\u00b0C) with a 12 h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. All the strains were a fed low-fat diet (Wayne Rodent BLOX 8604; Harlan Teklad Laboratory). 60-80 day old mice fasted for 16 h at 7pm and sacrificed at 9am the following morning. Mice were bled from the retro-orbital sinus into tubes containing EDTA (final concentration 1 mM), after isofluorane inhalation. Plasma was collected and stored at \u221280 o C until analysis. Plasma HDL-C measurements. Plasma cholesterol levels (Invitrogen) were determined biochemically following the manufacturer's guidelines. (Shao et al., 2005) . Efflux of [ 3 H]cholesterol was measured after a 4 h incubation in medium with APOB depleted serum HDL (2.8% v/v). ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity was calculated as the percentage of total [ 3 H]cholesterol (medium plus cell) released into the medium of BHK cells stimulated with mifepristone after the value obtained with cells stimulated with medium alone was subtracted. HDL isolation. Serum HDL was prepared by adding calcium (2 mM final concentration) to plasma and using PEG (polyethylene glycol, 8kDa, Sigma) to precipitate lipoproteins containing APOB (VLDL, IDL, LDL). After centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4 o C, serum HDL was harvested from the supernatant. HDL was isolated from serum or EDTA-anticoagulated plasma, using sequential ultracentrifugation (d=1.063-1.21 mg/mL) (Vaisar et al., 2007) . HDL was stored on ice in the dark and used within 1 week of preparation. For each isolation batch, control samples from the same pooled mouse plasma were included and further processed by tryptic digest and MS to control for experimental variability. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis. HDL (10 \u03bcg protein) isolated by ultracentrifugation and 0.5 ug of yeast carboxypeptidase were solubilized with 0.1% RapiGest (Waters) in 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate, reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin (1:20, w/w HDL protein; Promega) for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. After a second aliquot of trypsin (1:20, w/w HDL protein) was added, samples were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. After RapiGest was removed by acid hydrolysis, samples were dried and stored at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis. Prior to analysis, samples were reconstituted in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (Pamir et al., 2016) . Tryptic digests of mouse HDL (1 \u03bcg protein) were injected onto a C18 trap column (Paradigm Platinum Peptide Nanotrap, 0.15 x 50 mm; Michrom Bioresources Inc.), desalted (50 \u03bcL/min) for 5 min with 1% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid, eluted onto an analytical reverse-phase column (0.15 x 150 mm, Magic C18AQ, 5 \u03bcm, 200 A; Michrom Bioresources Inc.), and separated on a Paradigm M4B HPLC (Michrom Bioresources Inc.) at a flow rate of 1 \u03bcL/min over 180 min, using a linear gradient of 5% to 35% buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) in buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid).

HDL digests were introduced into the gas phase by ESI, positive ion mass spectra were acquired with a orbitrap mass spectrometer (Fusion, Thermo Electron Corp.) using datadependent acquisition (one MS survey scan followed by MS/MS scans of the 8 most abundant ions in the survey scan) with a 350-1400 m/z scan. An exclusion window of 30 s was used after 2 acquisitions of the same precursor ion (Pamir et al., 2016; Vaisar et al., 2007) . Protein identification. MS/MS spectra were matched against performed using the Comet search engine (version 2015.01 rev. 1) against a mouse UniProt database appended with yeast caboxypeptidase Y protein sequence (52,639 total sequences). The following Comet search parameters were applied: peptide mass tolerance of +/-20.0 ppm allowing for C13 isotope offsets, full tryptic digest allowing up to 2 missed cleavages, oxidized methionine variable modification, and carbamidomethyl cysteine static modification. The search results were subsequently processed though the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (version 4.8.0) using the PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet tools using an adjusted probability of \u22650.90 for peptides and \u22650.95 for proteins. Each charge state of a peptide was considered a unique identification (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003) . We used the gene and protein names in the Entrez databases (National Center for Biotechnology Information; based on the nomenclature guidelines of the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (http://www.gene.ucl.ca.uk/nomenlature) for human (Wain et al., 2002) and Mouse Genome Informatics (http://www.infromatics.jax.org.nomen/) guidelines (Davisson, 1994) to identify HDL proteins and to eliminate the redundant identifications of isoforms and protein fragments frequently found in databases used in proteomic analysis (Rappsilber and Mann, 2002) . This approach also permits cross-referencing of proteins from different species.",

Proteins considered for analysis had to be detected in \u226530 analyses (%10 of the total samples) with \u22652 unique peptides. Because only a few peptides are typically measured for a given protein, these peptides might not be sufficient to define all isoforms of the protein that are present in the sample therefore, when MS/MS spectra could not differentiate between protein isoforms, the isoform with the most unique peptides was used for further analysis. PSMs for each protein, normalized to either spiked yeast carboxypeptidase or to total PSMs for peptides from each sample, were used to calculate a normalized PSM to compare the relative protein composition of mouse strains' HDLs (Vaisar et al., 2007) . Supplemental Table 1 provides the total calculated PSMs for each protein, the individual peptides that identified each protein, the total number peptide spectra matches, and relative quantification as normalized to yeast carboxypeptidase Y total PSMs or total PSMs of one sample. HDL particle size. HDL particle size was quantified by calibrated ion mobility analysis (Hutchins et al., 2014) . Briefly, HDL isolated by ultracentrifugation from EDTA plasma is introduced into the gas-phase ions by ESI. Because electrophoretic mobility depends chiefly on size, ion mobility analysis data are expressed in terms of particle diameter (nm), which corresponds to the calculated diameter of a singly charged, spherical particle with the same electrophoretic mobility (Hutchins et al., 2014) . Association analyses. GWAS for protein levels and gene expression was performed using correction for population structure as described (Hui et al., 2015; Orozco et al., 2012) . Loci were defined as cis if the peak SNP mapped within 1 Mb of gene position and trans if it mapped outside (cis significance threshold, p < 1.4 e-3; trans threshold, p < 6.13e-6).",
