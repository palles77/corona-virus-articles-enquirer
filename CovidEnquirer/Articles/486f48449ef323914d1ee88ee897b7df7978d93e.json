            "text": "Leukocyte responses in the patient are evaluated by the leukogram. The leukogram is the leukocyte portion of the complete blood count (CBC) and includes the total leukocyte (white blood cell [WBC]) count, differential leukocyte count (Diff), and description of WBC morphology. The relative leukocyte differential count (relative Diff) is the percentages of various leukocyte types (i.e., segmented neutrophils [segs], nonsegmented neutrophils [nonsegs], lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils). The absolute differential leukocyte count (absolute Diff) is the number of each type of leukocyte per volume (microliter or liter) of blood. Examination of leukocyte morphology on the stained blood smear is used to determine a relative Diff and detect various abnormalities. Selected hematologic techniques are described in Chapter 2. This chapter is intended to give an overview of understanding the leukocyte response and to answer common questions in diagnosis. Supplemental information regarding leukogram interpretation may be found in other textbooks. 18, 20, 25, 35, 46 Leukocytes are inflammatory cells, and changes in the leukogram are mainly used to identify the presence of inflammatory disease and characterize inflammation as to severity and type. The leukogram is not highly sensitive in detecting mild, focal, or chronic inflammation; therefore, a normal WBC count and Diff does not exclude inflammatory disease from the diagnosis. Acute phase protein concentrations, such as C-reactive protein in dogs and serum amyloid A in cats, are much more sensitive tests to document the presence of inflammation. The manual Diff is imprecise; therefore, the clinician should use prominent changes in the number of types of WBCs for diagnosis.",

The AutoDiff has several uses in the dog and cat, but these uses vary with the instrument and the patient's problem. Current veterinary instruments fail to identify all types of canine and feline leukocytes. No automated instrument enumerates the number of bands and younger neutrophils, and most instruments fail to identify nonsegs or basophils.

Although the bone marrow produces some lymphocytes, most lymphocytes are produced by the peripheral lymphoid tissues (i.e., thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue, gut-associated lymphoid tissue). Leukocytes develop in the bone marrow from pluripotent and committed stem cells influenced by interleukins and colony-stimulating factors (Figure 4 -2). 26 Neutrophils compose the majority of leukocytes in blood, and usually leukocytosis is caused by neutrophilia. Kinetics of neutrophils has been well studied and is best understood. Thus the initial discussion here focuses on neutrophils. Cellular \"pools\" are used to conceptualize and describe the \"location\" of neutrophils within the bone marrow and blood and to simplify interpretation of bone marrow and CBC data (Figure 4-3) . Bone marrow is divided into two pools. The first, the mitotic pool of myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes, provides a steady supply of neutrophils to meet tissue demand for these cells. The second pool is maturation and storage, which consists of metamyelocytes, bands, and segs that lack mitotic ability. Precursor cells undergo progressive maturation and provide a reserve pool of segs to meet sudden increased tissue demands for neutrophils until the mitotic pool increases neutrophil production. It is uncommon in the dog and cat to have leukopenia during in that order). As bone marrow stores of segs are depleted, nonsegs (e.g., bands, metamyelocytes, younger neutrophils) are released into the blood, and a left shift occurs: A left shift is a specific indicator of inflammation, and the severity of the left shift reflects the severity of inflammation.",

The marginal neutrophil pool is a \"hidden\" population associated with the endothelial lining of capillaries, especially the lungs and spleen. The circulating and marginal cell pools make up the total blood neutrophil pool (TBNP). Neutrophils distribute between circulating and marginal cell pools, circulate for a brief period of time (half-life of 7.4 hours), and emigrate from blood vessels into tissues. Shifts between these pools can affect the WBC count, especially in cats. In dogs, circulating and marginal pools are about equal. In cats, the marginal pool is two to three times the size of the circulating pool (Table  4-1) .

Inflammation is also suggested by leukocytosis greater than that usually expected with corticosteroid-or eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and even basophils, increase in blood and other tissues in various types of inflammatory disease (see later discussions). Neutrophils are specialists at killing bacteria, and bacterial infection (i.e., sepsis) commonly causes neutrophilic types of inflammation (e.g., exudative, purulent, suppurative, abscess) as well as pyogranulomatous inflammation. However, neutrophilia occurs with other infections such as certain mycotic, protozoal, and viral infections (e.g., feline infectious peritonitis). Inflammation also may occur from nonseptic processes such as necrosis (e.g., pancreatitis, pansteatitis, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, [IMHA]), chemical exposure (e.g., turpentine is an experimental method of abscess formation), immunemediated diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, IMHA), and toxins (e.g., endotoxin, snake bite). Neoplasms may cause inflammation in several ways, such as causing ulceration, causing necrosis in normal tissues, outgrowing or damaging the blood supply with subsequent necrosis in the tumor, predisposing the patient to infection, or producing a paraneoplastic effect wherein tumor products stimulate the bone marrow to produce neutrophils or eosinophils.",

Changes in individual patients may vary from this typical pattern due to treatment, rupture of an abscess, or the like. The greatest left shift is expected in early stages of the disease process, because as the preexisting bone marrow storage pool is depleted of segs, then more bands and metamyelocytes are released to meet early intense demand. With time, myeloid hyperplasia within the bone marrow expands neutrophil production. When neutrophil production and maturation time are sufficient, mainly mature segs are released into the blood and the severity of the left shift should diminish or disappear. If tissue inflammation stabilizes at a persistent low to moderate level, the bone marrow should reach a production rate sufficient for most neutrophils to mature before release. Thus chronic inflammation may be characterized by little to no left shift and minimal to no leukocytosis. Therefore, chronic or mild inflammation may be difficult to document by leukogram data alone. Acute phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein or serum amyloid A, are sensitive indicators of inflammation and may be used to complement the leukogram. Increased rouleaux (see Chapter 2) in canine blood smears or fever in the patient suggests inflammation. Increased rouleaux formation usually is associated with production of acute phase proteins such as fibrinogen. A normal leukogram appearance does not exclude inflammatory diseases, especially if inflammation is mild or chronic, or only involves a surface (e.g., cystitis).",

However, the number of bands, metamyelocytes, and myelocytes reported will vary among observers. Exact numbers of these cells are often impossible to determine when severe toxic change is present, in which case a subjective description should be used; for example, \"The blood had a severe degenerative left shift with severe toxic change in neutrophils, though exact numbers of each cell type could not be determined.\" may be the most honest description.

Immature neutrophils (nonsegs) observed in blood include bands (stabs), metamyelocytes (juveniles), myelocytes, and promyelocytes. Bands usually constitute most of the left shift because the more mature neutrophils are released from bone marrow first. Neutrophils younger than bands indicate an increasingly severe left shift associated with increasingly intense inflammation. If several myelocytes and metamyelocytes are found, the number of metamyelocytes, myelocytes, and promyelocytes should be reported individually (not simply grouped as nonsegs) to indicate severity of the left shift. Detectable numbers of blast cells (i.e., myeloblasts) or irregular maturation patterns may suggest granulocytic leukemia. More nonsegs than segs indicates a degenerative left shift and a poor prognosis. This period is also accompanied by the lymphopenia of stress. During later phases of inflammation, a more mature form of neutrophilia is expected, because bone marrow hyperplasia and marrow production of neutrophils should be adequate to allow maturation of neutrophils before release into blood. Tissue demand for neutrophils also tends to decrease during recovery. Toxic Neutrophils). A degenerative left shift, leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, leukemoid reaction, or a combination thereof is an atypical, unexpected response to inflammatory disease indicating severe disease, toxemia, severe stress, inadequate bone marrow production, problems interfering with an effective response, or a combination of these. A degenerative left shift has more nonsegs than segs, regardless of total leukocyte count. Finding more immature than mature neutrophils indicates that the bone marrow cannot produce neutrophils at a rate sufficient for them to mature completely prior to release. Either tissue demand for neutrophils has escalated dramatically, cell production is decreased, or both. Severity of change and trend over daily CBCs are important in assessing prognosis. A degenerative left shift, severe neutropenia and leukopenia, lymphopenia, and marked toxic change in most neutrophils often suggest gram-negative sepsis, such as a ruptured intestine or parvovirus enteritis. Both leukopenia and neutropenia are unfavorable prognostic signs. These findings suggest that bone marrow is incapable of producing sufficient numbers of neutrophils, that tissue consumption of neutrophils is overwhelming, or both. Neutropenia, whether primary (bone marrow disease) or secondary (excessive tissue consumption), severely predisposes the patient to infection and septicemia. Leukopenia is usually caused by neutropenia, but lymphopenia may also cause leukopenia despite normal neutrophil numbers. Lymphopenia usually indicates stress. Severe or persistent lymphopenia indicates severe or persistent stress. In severe leukopenia (e.g., <1000 WBCs/\u00b5l), a left shift is not concluded even if all neutrophils are nonsegs, because an increase in the absolute number of immature neutrophils greater than 1000 WBCs/\u00b5l is not possible. (Trying to perform a manual differential WBC count is also not necessary because the total WBCs already indicates a neutropenia and lymphopenia, and imprecision of a 25 to 50 ManDiff count with abnormally appearing cells is very great. Automated instrument differential counts are more accurate in severe leukopenia.)",

Leukocytosis in dogs is usually less than 40,000 WBCs/\u00b5l. In 182 canine CBC exams with leukocytosis, 151 (83%) had 17,500 to 39,990 WBCs/\u00b5l.

Bicytopenia or pancytopenia (decreases in cells of two or three cell lines, respectively) suggests primary bone marrow disease. However, overwhelming infection often causes DIC, which causes thrombocytopenia (bicytopenia). Inflammation causes anemia that may exist prior to a severe exacerbation of the disease. Erythrocytes have long life spans, so anemia is often not apparent early in primary bone marrow disease.

This may detect myeloid hypoplasia, ineffective granulopoiesis, bone marrow necrosis, myelofibrosis, disseminated granulomatous inflammation, leukemia, and other diseases (see Chapter 2). A proper history may reveal treatments or toxins that can affect granulopoiesis (e.g., estrogen or phenylbutazone). Ineffective granulopoiesis confuses many clinicians. The leukopenia is accompanied by normal to increased numbers of myeloid cells (i.e., myeloid hyperplasia). Neutropenia due to myeloid hypoplasia seems more logical. In ineffective granulopoiesis, neutrophils are destroyed in the bone marrow by apoptosis before they mature and are released into the blood. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) occurs in healthy dogs as part of the mechanism to regulate effective neutrophil production. Apoptosis is affected by various mediators, and there is no morphologic change to allow diagnosis of a specific cause. Death of cells within the marrow may be excessive in various infections and drug treatments. Approximately half of feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-positive, neutropenic cats have marked granulocytic hyperplasia indicating excessive apoptosis, whereas half have myeloid hypoplasia suggesting viral destruction of hematopoietic tissue as consumption of neutrophils during severe inflammation and/or reduced bone marrow production ( Table 4-5) . (See also the discussion of bone marrow in Chapter 2 and the discussed of myeloid hypoplasia in the section on Bone Marrow Problems Causing Neutropenia later.) A third cause of neutropenia, which is rare and more theoretical, is a temporary shift of neutrophils from the circulating to the marginal pool, where they cannot be counted. Endotoxin can cause this change. This transient form of neutropenia is actually \"pseudoneutropenia,\" because the TBNP is unchanged. Rarely, immune-mediated or \"steroid-responsive\" neutropenia occurs with lupus or some drug treatments.",

Macrophages contribute to granulomatous and pyogranulomatous inflammation. Macrophages remove necrotic debris, kill fungi and some parasites, inactivate viruses, attempt to remove foreign bodies, remove senescent and abnormal red blood cells (RBCs), and destroy neoplastic cells. Monocytosis is expected in inflammatory diseases with a high need for macrophages. For example, monocytosis is common in IMHA, in which large numbers of RBCs are destroyed in macrophages. Necrotic cell debris also must be removed to allow tissue regeneration and healing. Monocytosis accompanies suppuration, pyogranulomatous and granulomatous inflammation, necrosis, malignancy, hemolytic or hemorrhagic disease, and immune-mediated diseases. Although macrophages are a \"late\" component of most inflammatory processes, monocytosis may occur in both acute and chronic disease processes and monocytosis alone should not be used to indicate chronicity of a process. (See earlier discussion on the canine corticosteroid response, which commonly has a monocytosis 8 to 12 hours after treatment.) If concurrent lymphopenia and eosinopenia are present, a stress or corticosteroid leukocyte response is likely. If lymphopenia and eosinopenia are not present, chronic inflammation or tissue destruction should be suspected. Monocytopenia is not significant. Low numbers of monocytes normally are present in the blood. Monocytes are also unevenly distributed on the blood smear, so imprecision is great with manual monocyte counts. Automated cell hematology analyzers often have difficulty in differentiating monocytes and large lymphocytes. With low numbers of monocytes normally and great imprecision in counting them, a monocytopenia cannot be reliably detected.",

A more intense eosinophilic response occurs with parasites within tissues (e.g., heartworms, strongyles, migrating lung flukes such as Paragonimus kellicotti). Endoparasites such as tapeworms or Giardia, which do not invade tissue, generally do not incite eosinophilia. Some parasites may not stimulate eosinophilia until they die and expose previously hidden antigens. Production of eosinophilia is an immune response. The first exposure to a parasite produces a modest, delayed eosinophilia. The second exposure to the same parasite results in an intense, dramatic eosinophilia.",

The number of neutrophils misclassified as monocytes reflects the severity of decrease in peroxidase. 17 Over half the neutrophils being incorrectly classified as monocytes was used to indicate the worst grade of myeloperoxidase deficiency. The Advia monocyte count was 40% in this blood sample, but the manual monocyte count was only 11%. with leukemia; and (5) radiation, which may alter the health of progenitor cells. Clinical signs of leukemia vary. Common signs include lethargy, pale mucous membranes, anorexia, weight loss, fever, frequent infections, icterus, and abnormal bleeding such as petechiae. Physical findings often include hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or tonsillar enlargement.",

Some myelodysplasia occurs with certain feline viral infections and is commonly noted with immune-mediated disease. For example, in IMHA, exuberant production of erythrocytes may occur related to the rapid and poorly regulated development, resulting in nucleated red cells with excessive cytoplasm and an eccentrically, not centrally placed, nucleus (Figure 4-17) . A recent example of dyserythropoiesis was reported in a dog associated with bone marrow metastasis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. 23 Leukemia Leukemia may be suspected based on extreme increases in WBC concentration numbers or relative to morphology that is atypical or markedly immature for the cell type. Lymphoid or myeloid (nonlymphoid) cells may be involved in leukemia. Common causes of leukemia include (1) virus infections, such as FeLV, which may affect progenitor cell development; (2) genetic abnormalities, inherited or acquired, that lead to altered cell growth; (3) defective immune systems, such as with FIV infection, that do not permit normal defense mechanisms against leukemia; (4) chemicals (e.g., benzene, therapeutic drugs), which have rarely been associated ",

Definitive diagnosis of specific leukemias usually requires a veterinary clinical pathologist. Slide review from routine CBC or bone marrow cytology with Wright-stained smears of EDTAanticoagulated blood may allow morphologic differentiation of the cellular origin, such as lymphoid versus myeloid (i.e., nonlymphoid). If cell morphology in a leukemic patient is insufficient to determine the cell lineage, one may use specialized tests (i.e., cytochemistry, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry, genetics testing) usually conducted at academic institutions or referral laboratories. 38 Cytochemistry involves nonimmunologic cytoplasmic markers for enzymes, lipids, or glycogen within the cell. 31 Enzymes include peroxidase, found in certain granulocytes, and nonspecific esterases, found in monocytes or T lymphocytes (Table 4-7) . Electron microscopy is helpful to study the ultrastructural features of the cytoplasm and nucleus. 13, 14 Immunocytochemistry (Table  4 -8) involves staining of specific cell surface antigens by the use of antibodies against CD3 (T cells), CD4 (T-helper cells), CD8 (T-cytotoxic or suppressor cells), CD14 (monocyte progenitors), CD21 (B cells), and CD79 (B cells). 28 Blood and bone marrow specimens for these special procedures require specific instructions in handling, preparation, and fixation. Therefore, the clinical pathologist should be consulted to avoid delay in diagnosis caused by improper sampling or sample handling. Even more specialized diagnostic tests are available that involve genetic testing such as clonality (e.g., polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangement [PARR]) for lymphoid neoplasms and detection of cytogenetic abnormalities for all hematopoietic neoplasms. 6, 42 Classification Schemes Classification schemes for hematopoietic neoplasms were developed and refined over many years, beginning with purely morphologic comparisons such as the French-American-British (FAB) classification system, which separates acute myeloid leukemia into eight subtypes, M0 through M7 (Figure 4-18 ) and its veterinary counterpart (Figure 4-19) , both of which are based on the cell of origin and its degree of maturity as determined by examination of Romanowsky-type (e.g., Wright) stained blood and bone marrow smears. Various classification systems also have been used to classify lymphoid neoplasms. Other classification systems, such as the National Cancer Institute Working Formulation and updated Kiel System, rely on morphologic and immunologic features. Further distinction of leukemia may be determined by cytochemical and immunochemical reactions (Figure 4-20) . The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme for hematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasia identifies the different disease types by tumor location plus morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic criteria to best determine the clinical prognosis for each disease (Box 4-1). 37 The lymphoid neoplasms involve lymphocytes and plasma cells; the myeloid neoplasms involve the remaining nonlymphoid leukocytes, including mast cells, erythroid cells, and megakaryocytes or platelets singly or in combination; and the histiocytic neoplasms involve macrophages and dendritic cells.",
