PTGS is commonly accomplished through delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cells. Standard plant siRNA delivery methods (Agrobacterium and viruses) involve coding siRNA into DNA vectors, and are only tractable for certain plant species. Herein, we develop a nanotube-based platform for direct delivery of siRNA, and show high silencing efficiency in intact plant cells. We demonstrate that nanotubes successfully deliver siRNA and silence endogenous genes owing to effective intracellular delivery and nanotubeinduced protection of siRNA from nuclease degradation. This study establishes that nanotubes could enable a myriad of plant biotechnology applications that rely on RNA delivery to intact cells. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Agrobacterium-mediated delivery, similarly, is also limited to use in certain plant species, often yields random DNA integration that can adversely and unpredictably affect the cell operation (15) , results in constitutive expression of siRNA thus limiting temporal control over gene silencing, and can be difficult to scale or multiplex for high-throughput or multi-gene target applications, respectively (16) .",

In this study, we demonstrate the delivery of a different RNAi molecule -single-stranded siRNA -into intact cells of plant leaves using high-aspect-ratio one dimensional carbon nanomaterials: singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). SWNTs are biocompatible allotropes of carbon that have a high aspect ratio cylindrical nanostructure with diameters of 0.8-1.2 nm and lengths of 500-1000 nm. SWNTs are capable of passively crossing the extracted chloroplast envelope (28) and plant cell membranes (29) due to their high aspect ratio morphology, uniquely high stiffness, and small dimensions. SWNTs are among the few nanomaterials that can be synthesized to have a smallest dimension (~ 1 nm) below the plant size exclusion limit of ~20 nm, while also providing a large cylindrical surface area from the extrusion of their 1-dimension out to ~ 500 nm. The resulting large surface area to volume ratio is thus amenable to facile loading of appreciable quantities of biological cargoes such as siRNA. In contrast, spherical nanoparticles must often exceed the plant cell wall size exclusion limit to load necessary quantities of bio-cargoes, due to the reduced scaling of the spherical nanoparticle surface area to volume. Furthermore, when bound to SWNTs, biomolecules are protected from degradation in mammalian systems (30) , exhibiting superior biostability compared to free biomolecules; a phenomenon we show herein can extend to plants. Moreover, SWNTs have strong intrinsic near-infrared (nIR) fluorescence (31, 32) within the biological tissuetransparency window and beyond the chlorophyll autofluorescence range, and thus enable tracking of cargo-nanoparticle complexes deep in plant tissues.",

To-date, there has yet to be a nanoparticle-based delivery platform for siRNA molecules into intact plant cells. Herein, we develop a SWNT-based siRNA delivery platform for the efficient silencing of an endogenous Nicotiana benthamiana gene in plant leaves. We show that SWNTs enable passive delivery (without external mechanical aid) and fluorescent-tracking of siRNA molecules in plant tissues. SWNTs present a non-toxic platform for siRNA delivery that uses a minimal siRNA dose to achieve silencing for up to 7 days, whereby silencing can be sustained upon re-infiltration of the siRNA-SWNT dose. With SWNT-mediated siRNA delivery, we achieve 95% gene silencing efficiency at the mRNA level, and show a significant delay in siRNA nuclease degradation in cells, and also at the single-molecule level, through protection by SWNTs. Taken altogether, SWNT-based delivery platform is rapid, scalable, facile to multiplex for multiple gene silencing targets, and speciesindependent (24, 33, (37) (38) (39) . In sum, this study establishes that SWNTs could be a promising resource to overcome plant RNA delivery limitations, and could enable a variety of plant biotechnology applications based on RNAi.",

We then eluted the desorbed siRNA and quantified it via absorbance at 260 nm. The results confirm that an insignificant amount of siRNA is desorbed when RNA-SWNTs incubated in water, whereas 66% of the siRNA is desorbed when incubated in plant cell lysate solution. We then ran the eluted RNA from the cell lysate sample on an agarose gel and showed that it is double-stranded, which verifies the formation of double-stranded siRNA in the cell cytosol. Additionally, zeta potential measurements of a-siRNA-SWNTs before and after hybridization in water and removal of desorbed RNA show unchanged nanoparticle zeta potential, suggesting there is not significant amount of RNA hybridizing and desorbing from SWNT surface in water ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).

To explore this hypothesis, we performed single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF) microscopy to probe single siRNA strand susceptibility to degradation by RNase A when adsorbed on SWNTs, compared to single free siRNA. To do so, we labeled the a-antisense strand of GFP siRNA with a 5' terminal Cy3 fluorophore, and immobilized RNA-Cy3 and RNA-Cy3-SWNTs onto parallel channels of a microfluidic slide (see Methods). We measured the Cy3 fluorescence in each channel before and after treatment with RNase A, whereby percent decrease in the number of Cy3 molecules was used as a proxy for the percent siRNA degraded (Fig. 5a) . Our TIRF results show that 98% \u00b1 0.3% (mean \u00b1 SD) of the initial Cy3-RNA immobilized on the channel surface is degraded after incubation with RNase A, whereas only 16% \u00b1 4.9% (mean \u00b1 SD) of Cy3-RNA is degraded when it is bound to SWNTs, suggesting that SWNTs protect the siRNA cargo from enzymatic degradation inside cells (Fig. 5b) .

Agarose gel electrophoresis of free ssRNA vs. ssRNA-SWNTs incubated in plant cell lysate for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours demonstrate that free ssRNA is degraded significantly faster in cells compared to ssRNA adsorbed on SWNTs (Fig. 5c) . Band intensity quantification of agarose gel reveals that upon starting with 200 ng ssRNA, free ssRNA is completely degraded within 12 hours, whereas the ssRNA on the SWNTs is only completely degraded after 24 hours (Fig. 5d and 5e) , which corresponds to a 12 hour increase in the residence time of siRNA strands in cells when delivered through SWNTs. This gives rise to prolonged and increased silencing efficiency, as siRNA strands in cells have higher chance of hybridizing into the active complex before getting degraded by plant nucleases. With a similar in vitro cell lysate degradation experiment, we also show that after hybridization and desorption, double-stranded siRNA has high stability and it persists in cells for more than 4-days after formulation ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ).",

This platform utilizes SWNTs, to which single-stranded sense and antisense siRNA are adsorbed separately, enabling thermodynamically-favorable siRNA hybridization once intracellular for subsequent gene silencing mechanisms. We show that ssRNA is protected from degradation for up to 24 hours when adsorbed to SWNTs, whereas free ssRNA is almost completely degraded by 6 hours. We show a similar siRNA protection phenomenon with single-molecule TIRF microscopy of individual siRNA molecules either free or adsorbed to SWNTs. With this rapid and facile SWNT delivery platform, we achieve transient and DNA-free silencing of genes in mature plant leaves with a low siRNA-SWNT dose, showing mRNA knockdown efficiencies of up to 95% within 1 day post-infiltration, returning to native transcript levels by day 7.

The pristine noncharged SWNT surface eliminates this problem and makes it possible to scale-up the delivery of siRNA for higher doses or systemic administration. Additionally, the platform could be adapted to loading multiple siRNA sequences to multiplex gene silencing targets by delivering a mixture of SWNTs suspended with multiple siRNA sequences or loading a single SWNT sample with multiple siRNA sequences. Furthermore, SWNT internalization and polynucleotide delivery into plants is hypothesized to be speciesindependent, can be used with monocots, non-model species, hard-to-transform species, and cargo-carrying SWNTs are expected to diffuse into the full thickness of leaves providing a uniform transformation profile (24) .",

For instance, SWNTs could aid nuclease-based genome editing in plants by delivery of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and/or messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for controlled and transient nuclease expression and subsequent genome editing. Another potential application of SWNT-based RNA delivery is for increasing homology-directed repair (HDR) rates in plants for gene knock-in applications, which could possibly be achieved by suppressing the expression of the genes required for competitive nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair pathways (48) . As the efficient suppression of these genes is only desirable for the few-day time window in which genome editing takes place, our SWNT-mediated gene silencing platform could enable such control over transient siRNA delivery. As such, SWNT-based delivery of polynucleic acids is a useful resource to expand the plant biotechnology toolkit.",
