However, these in vitro conditions vary quite drastically from the tissues that are commonly infected in vivo. Over the years, a number of systems have been developed that allow the establishment of three-dimensional (3D) tissue structures that have properties similar to their in vivo 3D counterparts. These 3D systems have numerous applications including drug testing, maintenance of large tissue explants, monitoring migration of human lymphocytes in tissues, analysis of human organ tissue development and investigation of virus-host interactions including viral latency. Here, we describe the establishment of tissue-like assemblies for human lung and neuronal tissue that we infected with a variety of viruses including the respiratory pathogens human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS corona virus (SARS-CoV) as well as the human neurotropic herpesvirus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV).",

            "text": "Tissue culture explant models were established in the 1920s, which allowed maintenance and expansion of organ tissues in culture or on filters [4, 5] . For certain tissues (e.g. skin), it was critical to keep the cultures at the air-liquid interface, thereby providing conditions similar to the in vivo environment [6] . To maintain native tissue architecture, 1-5 mm 2 tissue explants were grown on collagen-coated cellulose sponges surrounded by plasma clots in roller tubes [2, 7] . A number of these systems are well established and widely used in contemporary research. However, the disadvantages of explant systems are that ex vivo tissues from humans are limited and often difficult to obtain. Explant cultures are also short lived and prone to necrosis due to insufficient nutrient and oxygen transfer within the tissue. Furthermore, it remains almost impossible to genetically modify primary tissues, while cultured cells can be readily modified using various targeted genome-editing techniques such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENS) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) [8] [9] [10] . To circumvent these limitations, culture systems have been established that allow de novo assembly of analog 3D tissues for a variety of applications.",

Peripheral cells commonly grow readily while cells in the center of the tissue undergo necrosis due to nutrient and oxygen deprivation. To provide a constant source of nutrients, chambers were developed that allowed metabolic exchange between a pool of medium and the culture chamber by diffusion across a membrane. This histo-physiological gradient mimics to some degree, the diffusion of essential nutrients in tissues [7, 11] . To enhance the establishment of 3D tissues in vitro, Nandi and colleagues embedded the cultures in collagenous gels providing a scaffold for tissue growth [12] . The collagen gels allow establishment of mammary-like tissue with ductile structures from mammary cells. These cultures show sustained growth for several weeks and closely resemble the corresponding tissue in vivo [12] . Taken together, the early advances allowed the maintenance of tissue explants and de novo assembly of 3D tissues, while retaining their normal shape and special associations [2] .",

            "text": "To improve the 3D tissue culture systems, bioreactors were introduced. Bioreactors are commonly used to produce pharmaceutical proteins such as interferon, growth hormones, and insulin molecules and to allow the maintenance of stable growth conditions over a long time period. In addition, bioreactors can provide defined culture conditions at exact time points, which is often required for the assembly and differentiation of 3D structures. Basic steps involved in construction of 3D tissue structures include tissue assembly, growth, formation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membranes. Cell differentiation is associated with cellular specialization and vascular (or pseudo-vasculature) formation and is required for the establishment of an ex vivo tissue comparable to their in vivo counterparts (Fig. 1) . To achieve this, each 3D tissue structure must be optimized for the following parameters (i) co-location of particles (tissues) of different sedimentation rates, (ii) three-dimensional spacial freedom that maximizes cell-to-cell and cell-to-microcarrier adherence required for assembly of the complex tissues, (iii) extremely low fluid shear stress and turbulence and (iv) oxygenation by active or passive diffusion with the exclusion of all air bubbles and permitting only dissolved gasses to enter/exit the bioreactor chamber thereby yielding a vessel devoid gas/fluid interface (zero headspace) [13, 14] . Standard vertically oriented bioreactors allow minimal assembly of complex functional mammalian tissues; however, the normal fluid mechanical effects in these systems often leads to excessive shear forces, turbulence and in many cases, inadequate oxygenation and nutrient transfer that cause cell death and pose critical barriers to the establishment of the functional 3D culture systems (Fig. 1) .",

The microcarriers serve as structural support for assembly and growth of 3D tissues [17] . Cells efficiently form bead-to-bead or matrix-to-matrix bridges in the RWV bioreactor at low agitation rates [18] , typically resulting in aggregates of approximately 12-15 microcarrier beads. The RWV system eliminates excessive agitation from stirring (vertical bioreactors) and minimizes other shear forces that damage the microcarrier 3D tissues [19, 20] . RVW systems are available in various commercially available volumes and can be scaled up to 1 liter.",

For example, we selected both DNA (VZV) and RNA (RSV, PIV3 and SARS-CoV) viruses to infect neuronal or respiratory TLAs, respectively, that were shown by transcript and protein analysis to reflect their physiological counterparts [26] [27] [28] [29] . The unique feature of the RWV system maintains cell viability of the virus-infected TLA tissues for longer time periods than their 2D-tissue culture counterparts. Importantly, high-titer, cell free virus (1 \u00c2 10 5 -10 7 /ml; Hepatitis C, 1 \u00c2 10 5 -10 7 ; RSV; and 1 \u00c2 10 7 /ml, PIV3 5 \u00c2 10 6 ) [25, 28, 30, 31] can be obtained from the supernatants of infected TLAs. Cytopathic effects (CPE) were detected in TLAs infected with SARS and RSV; however, this CPE did not impair the ability of the RWV cultures to replicate. In the case of VZV we succeeded in our objective to construct and infect neuronal TLAs with the virus that remained viable for months during which time the virus/host interaction was monitored [27] . Here we describe the establishment of neuronal and lung (TLAs) in the RWV system that can be infected with various viruses.",

Rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor assembly RWV bioreactors are available as batch fed or continuous flow, and allow tissue growth under 3D conditions in an optimized fluid suspension environment. The system is based on a rotating cylinder completely filled with fluid. Shortly after the cylinder begins to rotate, the fluid in the cylinder becomes coupled to the wall and rotates at the same speed as the vessel and TLAs rotate at the same speed (angular velocity) as their supporting fluid. Since TLAs have a slightly higher density than the fluid, they become suspended without stirring and with extremely low shear (0.15 dynes/cm 2 ). Oxygenation is achieved by passive diffusion to avoid gas bubbles and associated shear forces [14] . 3D cultures in the RWV system ( Fig. 2 ) require the following equipment, materials, media and supplies.",

Cells were propagated in GTSF-2 media as described previously [15] . For the establishment of human neuronal TLAs, we used normal human neural progenitor (NHNP) cells (Lonza 20 ; Walkersville, MD, USA). NHNPs from multiple donors were initially propagated in GTSF-2 on human fibronectin-coated flasks 21 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and pooled from at least five donors as described previously [32] (US patent 5,846,807 and 5,858,783).

Cells were allowed to attach to the beads for 48 h in the bioreactor before re-feeding with GTSF-2 containing 10% FBS. To maintain the TLA cultures within normal human physiological blood chemistry parameters (80-120 mg/dL glucose and pH 7.2), 20-90% of the media was replaced as required with fresh GTSF-2 media every 24-48 h, thus facilitating efficient TLA tissue growth. All metabolic determinations were made using an iStat analyzer as described above. Gently press on compliant syringe originally placed on vessel at time of inoculation and pull on empty sample syringe to remove sample (two syringes). This step must be done while vessel is rotating to prevent sedimentation of the TLAs during sampling; therefore, care must be taken to prevent syringes from detaching from the vessel. (3) When desired volume of sample has been removed and replaced with equal volume of fresh medium from compliance syringe, turn off power. Close valve on sampling syringe port and remove sampling syringe. Repeat this step if multiple samples are required. (4) Replace Lure lock cap and turn on rotator power. Note: we routinely take samples every 24-48 h and analyze them by light microscopy, RT-PCR, proteomics (Luminex), SEM or ESEM.

The tissues can be maintained for several months and allow the infection with a number of viruses. Both DNA (VZV) and RNA (SARS-CoV, PIV3 and RSV) viruses have been used to infect these systems to analyze infection in a more physiological setting [26] [27] [28] [29] . We recently demonstrated that VZV can establish a persistent infection in these NHNP TLAs, which can be maintained for at least 3 months [27] . This system The integrated nature and alignment of the neural TLA is similar to the native neural tissues ex vivo (D). Images were taken using a FEI Quanta 250 environmental scanning electron microscope. 8 will provide the basis for future studies to decipher the establishment of VZV latency and reactivation. The use of genetically modified NHNP cells would provide a suitable system to address the cellular factors that influence VZV latency. Similarly, neuronal TLAs could be used as a system to study other neurotropic viruses such as herpes simplex (HSV), Dengue and West Nile viruses. Similarly, lung TLAs can be infected with SARS for up to 10 days proving a system that more closely resembles the infection in vivo. Intriguingly, TLAs can be seeded with various immune cells [23, 37] , allowing analyses of virus infection in the presence of defined components of the immune system. Furthermore, production of live attenuated VZV vaccines is difficult due to the highly cell-associated nature of the virus. However, the virus is cell-free in the skin lesions of chicken pox. Engineering skin TLA may provide the cell system required to generation of high-titer, cell free attenuated virus for vaccine production. ",
