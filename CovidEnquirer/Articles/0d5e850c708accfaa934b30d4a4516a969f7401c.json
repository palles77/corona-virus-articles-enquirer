Acute viral gastroenteritis (AGE) is seen in all parts of the world, especially in infants and young children. AGE ranges from mild and self-limiting to severe, debilitating diarrhea, occasionally resulting in mortality. These illnesses have a huge impact, particularly in parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America, with over 3 million fatalities recorded per annum. AGE also has major effects on nutritional status and growth. Viruses appear to be the commonest causes of gastroenteritis in infants and young children but are not distinguishable clinically from other types of gastroenteritis. Some of these viruses are specific for humans, while others are implicated in zoonotic disease. In most instances, infection follows the general rules for faecal-oral transmission. Enteric viruses are transmissible by food and water and enter the body through the gastrointestinal tract, thus the viruses are commonly acquired after ingestion of sewage contaminated food or water or from poor hygiene when preparing food. The viruses are shed in high concentrations in faeces and vomit and can remain infectious in the environment for several months. Many viruses are difficult or impossible to cultivate in vitro, and tests are unreliable or not developed, thus many cases of non-bacterial acute gastroenteritis viruses are under reported.",

A tenth novel rotavirus species has been identified in Schreiber's bats (Miniopterus schreibersii), provisionally known as Rotavirus J (B\u00e1nyai et al., 2018) . Within the RVA group, the viruses are classified antigenically and genetically, based on the main antigenic determinants, the outer capsid proteins, VP7 and VP4, which specify the G and P serotypes/genotypes, respectively. A whole genome classification system has been adopted for classification of all 11 segments of the rotavirus genome, applying nucleotide homology cutoff values to distinguish genotypes.",

In: World Health Organisation: media centre). Due to the prolonged infection times, the economic consequences of an outbreak through absenteeism from work can be significant. In developing countries where sanitation is poor, most children are infected while young and are asymptomatic. This gives them immunity and, as such, they cannot become reinfected as adults. In such areas, epidemics of the virus are uncommon but unvaccinated adult visitors from areas where HAV is not commonplace are vulnerable. In economically developed countries, epidemics are rare, because good hygiene practices will prevent person-to-person spread. However, in transitional economies, the introduction of improved sanitation may mean that the population is not exposed as children. As such, the introduction of the virus to these susceptible populations of adults can result in significant outbreaks (Lemon et al., 2018) .",

Other routes of transmission are consuming raw or undercooked foods from infected animals or shellfish, blood transfusions or vertical transmission from pregnant women to the foetus (Wulffen et al., 2018) . The virus has a worldwide distribution but is most prevalent in South and East Asia and is associated with areas where sanitation is poor and contaminated faeces can enter the water system. In regions where the virus is endemic, outbreaks are common, usually associated with contaminated drinking water, recurring at intervals of years and may involve thousands of people. Such infections are predominantly genotype 1 or 2 (Melga\u00e7o et al., 2018) . In non-endemic regions, infections were previously associated with international travel, but now the majority of cases are zoonotic genotype 3 or 4 infections from swine or deer.

SARS-CoV was first discovered in 2003, after a pandemic of severe respiratory disease that originated in Guangdong Province, China. It caused disease in 8098 people and of these, 774 died (see \"Relevant Websites section\"). It is now believed that Chinese Horseshoe bats are the original reservoir host of SARS-like CoVs (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005) . Bats transmit these viruses, probably via faecal contamination of food sources directly to humans or to intermediate hosts, most notably palm civets and raccoon dogs, and these then transmit virus to humans (Guan et al., 2003) . These animals are traded in live animal markets as food and it is thought that aerosolisation of faeces and other body fluids caused respiratory infection of humans (Wang et al., 2005) . Once SARS-CoV entered humans, it was spread by respiratory droplets or contamination of surfaces by droplets that were then transferred to the mouth, nose or eyes by touching. There was also a cluster of cases in an apartment block in Hong Kong that probably arose from sewage aerosolisation into the ventilation system that proceeded to cause respiratory infection of many of the inhabitants (Tilgner et al., 2003) .",

It is thought that bat saliva or urine is the major source of virus and so food such as partially eaten fruit contaminated with saliva or contamination by faeces and urine may be the source of infection for other hosts. In the Malaysian outbreak of 1998-99, it is thought that contaminated fruit from trees adjacent to pig farms encroaching into forest were dropped into enclosures where they were eaten by the pigs or that there was direct contamination of enclosures with urine. The pigs amplified the virus (they also showed clinical respiratory and neurological disease), so that farmers and workers in direct/close contact were infected and were the population where the majority of cases was seen (Parashar et al., 2000) . However, in the Indian sub-continent, especially Bangladesh, where Nipah virus infection was first recognized in 2001, the major risk factor for contracting Nipah virus is drinking raw palm sap (Luby et al., 2006) . There is photographic evidence of fruit bats licking sap from the cuts in the trees from which the sap is collected, and contamination by faeces is seen in or on the pots (Khan et al., 2010; Rahman et al., 2012) .",

Influenza viruses are negative stranded RNA viruses that have a segmented genome (Shaw and Palese, 2013) . Influenza A nomenclature uses the 2 genomic segments that encode the envelope glycoproteins, haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) because these proteins are major contributors to the pathogenicity of the viruses. The wildlife reservoir for these viruses is wild birds, especially waterfowl, in which a subclinical gastroenteric infection is usually seen. Thus, these viruses are often called avian influenza. There are several high pathogenicity avian influenza A (HPAI) virus genotypes but one of the most pathogenic for humans and other animals are those in the H5N1 genotype (Wright et al., 2013) . With widespread sequencing, the ability to group viruses as 'clades', i.e., those viruses that are derived from a common ancestor, has now allowed a numerical naming system to be instituted. The Eurasian-African H5N1 viruses that are circulating and causing human and animal disease can be split into several (\u226520) clades (see \"Relevant Websites section\").

The virion is usually very labile (Markey et al., 2013b) but it has been shown that avian influenza virus is infectious for months in low temperature water and for over a week in water at 22\u00b0C (Hinshaw et al., 1979; Markwell and Shortridge, 1982) with increased survival when water has neutral to basic pH (7.0-8.5) and low ammonia concentrations (Keeler et al., 2014) . It is also stable in frozen lakes (Shoham et al., 2012) , allowing maintenance in the environment and infection of waterfowl from year to year. The seasonality of epidemics in humans is affected by temperature and humidity with the virus surviving better at 20\u00b0C in low humidity conditions but at 30\u00b0C requiring higher humidity. Thus, the cool, dry conditions of winter favour transmission in temperate zones and humid, rainy conditions favour transmission in tropical and sub-tropical zones.

In Asia, contamination of the environment by the faeces of waterfowl leads to infection of domestic poultry including chickens, ducks and geese which are often kept in the same environment. This usually causes severe disease and high titres of virus to be secreted from the domestic birds promoting infection of those working with or in contact with them, or in the food chain. Farming of poultry and pigs together increases the risk of transmission to pigs and they can amplify and increase the risk of human infection. Influenza virus A causes seasonal outbreaks with occasional severe epidemics/pandemics in humans and animals. The Asian-African H5N1 lineage is thought to have originated from commercial geese in the Guangdong province of China in 1996. This has since been spread across the globe by wild birds and infected people. There is evidence that H5N1 has infected humans directly by drinking duck blood or eating duck meat, however, aerosolisation and inhalation is the more common route (Shao et al., 2011; Tumpey et al., 2002) . This virus has evidence of direct bird to human transmission without the need for adaptation through a secondary species such as pigs (Wright et al., 2013) .",

For example, a standardised method based on quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) for the detection of NoV and Hep A in food has been developed by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) working group (TC 275/WG6/TAG 4 -Detection of viruses in food) (Lees and CEN WG6 TAG4, 2010) and provides a tool to quantify NoV concentration in shellfish. It has been used to demonstrate that the risk of gastrointestinal illness associated with consumption of oysters increases with increasing concentrations of NoV genome copies present (Lowther et al., 2012) . Costantini et al. (2010) demonstrated that a commercially available NoV enzyme immunoassay showed excellent specificity but low sensitivity both for outbreaks as well as for samples from sporadic cases. The assay detected 18 of the 21 genotypes evaluated and that at least 10 7 virus particles g \u22121 of faecal sample were required for a positive signal.

A competitive RT-PCR SYBR green assay was designed based on conserved regions of the VP6 gene of group A rotaviruses, producing a 433 base pair fragment (Schwarz et al., 2002) . An in vitro synthesised RNA with a 43-base deletion with respect to the wild-type sequence of this fragment was used as an internal control. Using these transcripts as templates, 10 RNA molecules were amplified and reproducibly detected. Using this protocol, the assay could be used to investigate the presence of rotavirus in environmental, food and water samples. Immunochromatography tests are also available for detecting rotaviruses in stool samples. A study undertaken by de Grazia et al. (2017) compared the performance of two commercially available one-step chromatographic immunoassays that detect both rotavirus and adenovirus. Both tests were able to detect the wide range of RVA genotypes circulating over the study period (including G1P[8] , G2P[4] , G3, G4, G9 and G12P[8] ).

A Taqman based assay was designed for the detection of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) by Noh et al. (2017) , based on the conserved spike S2 region of human SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their related bat CoVs. This assay can detect SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans but also several bat CoVs that are closely related to these viruses in bats. A monoclonal antibody-based capture enzyme immunoassay for the detection of nucleocapsid antigen in sera from patients with SARS was developed by Che et al. (2004) . This assay used a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies for capture and rabbit polyclonal antibodies for detection of serum antigen. The sensitivity of the assay was 84.6% in 13 serologically confirmed SARS patients with blood taken during the first 10 days after the onset of symptoms (11 of 13). The specificity of the assay was 98.5% in 1272 healthy individuals (1253 of 1272). There was no cross-reaction with other human and animal coronaviruses in this assay.",
