Macro variables include growth rates of industrial production and imports, discount rates, yield spread and inflation rate. In addition, growth rate of total foreign tourist arrivals (DTA) was introduced as another critical macro factor that may affect Chinese hotel stock returns, considering a tremendous growth of tourism in China. Empirical results indicated that the impact of DTA was positive, but insignificant. Thus, Chinese hotel stock returns were more sensitive to general macro variables. Non-macro events that could significantly impact Chinese hotel stock returns encompass financial crises, natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, political events, and sports mega-events. Discussions and conclusions are provided to guide hospitality investors. r where E is the expectation operator, DV t is the dividend paid at the end of period t, and k is the appropriate discount rate. Based on the theoretical framework of the DDM, Chen et al. (1986) suggested that macroeconomic (macro hereafter) factors have systematic influences on stock prices through the impact on future dividends and the discount rate. Those macro factors, as they reported, that could significantly affect US stock returns comprised industrial production growth rates, yield spread, term spread, expected inflation rates, and unexpected inflation rates.",

Among all, economic researchers, financial investors and policy makers have paid an increasing attention to the relationship between macroeconomic variables and stock returns. The dividend discount model (DDM) states that the stock price index (SPI) is equal to the present value of all expected future dividends into perpetuity: Along with the fast growth of equity markets, China National Tourism Administration (2002) reported that, in 2000, the number of international tourists traveling to China reached 31.24 million and the tourism receipts were 16.23 billion in US dollars (US$), which ranked number five and seven, respectively, in the world. Based on the forecasts by World Tourism Organization (1997) , Avelini Holjevac (2003) predicted that Europe would have the lowest tourist growth rate, whereas East Asia and the Pacific would have the largest tourist growth rate. Pizam (1999) believed that, by the year 2050, China would be one of four major tourist destinations. Accordingly, the newness and distinct features of the stock market and rapid tourism development make China a unique case to conduct research on the connection between macro and non-macro variables and hotel stock returns.",

This study can provide more insights into the link between macro variables and hospitality stock returns by examining to what extent local macro factors (macro variables of US, Taiwan, and China) explain respective local hotel stock returns and whether the explanatory power of macro variables differ significantly across countries.",

This variable is commonly considered as a proxy for tourism development or expansion (Wang and Godbey, 1994; Kim et al., 2006) and expected to have a more direct influence on the tourism and hospitality sector. For example, Kim et al. (2006) showed that tourism expansion and economic development, measured by growth in gross domestic product (GDP), reinforce each other. Chen (2006a) further found that business conditions (proxied by GDP growth) significantly affect financial performance of tourism firms. Therefore, the second objective is to investigate the impact of TA, as an additional critical and feasible macro variable, on hotel stock returns.",

Regression tests and empirical findings are presented in Section 4. Section 5 discusses major findings. The last section concludes the paper and provides some future research directions. Canina (1996) examined the initial public offerings (IPOs) in the US hotel industry. The author found that underwriters generally viewed the primary issue of most hotel and casino stocks as more risky than new stock offerings. Atkinson et al. (1998) studied the impact of option listings on 21 common stocks in the casino and gaming industry. They showed that prices significantly decreased during both 2-day and 5-day periods, following the listing. Nonetheless, stock prices recovered right afterwards and no evidence of a permanent changes in stock prices was detected. Kim et al. (2002) compared the performance of the US hotel real estate investment trusts (REITs) over the period from 1993 to 1999 with that of the overall market and six other REIT sectors. Empirical results revealed that hotel REITs exhibited the highest risk and underperformed office, industrial and diversified REIT sectors. Rushmore (1992) assessed seven stock valuation measures used for the acquisition and appraisal of hotels in the US and offered a discussion of the strength and weakness of each technique. Elgonemy (2000) examined the pricing of lodging stocks. He noted that hotel stocks, by their nature, were not for day traders or momentum investors, who were seeking short-term high returns, but rather for investors who were focusing on long-term values. Borde (1998) and Gu and Kim (2002) examined whether particular financial characteristics of a restaurant firm, such as liquidity, dividend-payout ratio, return on assets, leverage and growth in earnings, could be used to predict the company's investment risk.",

Krueger and Kennedy (1990) showed that the Super Bowl could serve as a useful predictor for stock market movements in US Investors, according to the study, could have outperformed the market simply by reacting to Super Bowl game outcomes from 1967 to 1988. Berman et al. (2000) investigated the announcement effect of the 2000 Sydney Olympic games on the Australian stock market. No significantly positive impact from the announcement was documented. Chen (2002) further claimed that tourism stocks failed to benefit significantly during the game period. In contrast, Veraros et al. (2004) were able to attribute the abnormally positive performance of both the Athens Stock Exchange as a whole and infrastructure related industries to the announcement of the 2004 Athens Olympic games. Negative effect of sports mega-events such as the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2002 Japan/Korea World Cup on Taiwanese hotel stock returns was reported in CKK (2005) . Raab and Schwer (2003) studied the short-and long-term impacts of the Asian financial crisis on Las Vegas gaming revenues. Empirical results indicated that the devaluation of local currencies of Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Taiwan failed to generate a significant long-term effect on gaming revenues in Las Vegas.",

Thus it is expected that TA factor would be more directly related to the tourism and hospitality sector. Kim et al.

A positive economic impact generally leads to an increase in sales and hence income (and earnings), which in turn can improve the financial performance of hotel companies. Therefore, we expected a positive link between the TA variable and hotel stock returns. Similarly, the growth rate of tourism expansion \u00f0DTA\u00de was calculated as: DTA t \u00bc \u00f0ln TA t \u00c0 ln TA t\u00c01 \u00de.

The standard deviation was 15.60%, which was relatively higher than that of lodging returns in US (9.55%) and that of hotel returns in Taiwan (14.53%) although their respective sample sizes were different.

Empirical results of the first regression indicated that, among six macro factors, DIP and DTA were positively correlated to hotel returns, whereas DIM, DDR, DSPD and INF had a negative influence on hotel returns. These findings supported the hypotheses we made. Of all six macro variables, only DIP, DIM, DDR and DSPD could significantly explain the hotel returns. The overall explanatory power of macro factors on the hotel return was about 7%. Regression II excluded the insignificant influential variables of INF and DTA. Test result did not change significantly. Since DDR was highly correlated with DSPD, we used regression II to run regressions III and IV, which excluded DDR and DSPD, respectively.

As anticipated, hotel stock returns had a negative response to the SARS outbreak, the 911 terrorist attacks in the US and the Asian financial crisis. The same consequences were found in Taiwan (CKK, 2005) . While hotel returns were most seriously hurt by the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, the 911 terrorist attacks in the US damaged Chinese hotel returns most. Moreover, the Asian financial crisis had a minimum negative impact on the Taiwan hotel stock returns among all non-macro variables, but it was the second most influencer in China. CKK (2005) further argued that safety is the most important factor when international tourists make travel decisions, therefore a negative impact of the SARS outbreak, natural disasters and the terrorist attacks on hotel returns is expected. In general, this study supported CKK's (2005) notion on the negative link between hotel stock returns and nonmacro forces, which threaten traveler's safety, except for the event of the Iraqi war. The Iraqi war had a significantly beneficial influence on Chinese hotel returns. It is suspected that during the war period, international tourists might have considered that traveling to China is safer than to the Middle East when making travel decision. Similar result was found in Chen (2006c) . Chen (2006c) detected that the international tourism demand (total tourist arrivals) for Taiwan significantly increased after the devastating earthquake struck deep under the Indian Ocean on December 26, 2005 and severely harmed the tourism industry of countries in the Southern Asia.",

As he noted, human rights groups showed evidence that China executed more people every year than any other country, and they further criticized China's policy of enforced sterilization and abortion as well as China's treatment of Tibet and of the Falun Gong movement. According to CNN news (2001), ''We deeply regret that Beijing is awarded the 2008 Olympic Games,'' spokesman for the India-based Central Tibetan Administration Kalon T.C. Tethong said in a statement right after the announcement. He further stated, ''This will put the stamp of international approval on Beijing's human rights abuses and will encourage China to escalate its repression.'' Anthony Ozimic, political secretary of the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children in England, further argued: ''We believe that awarding the games to Beijing will boost this regime and provide cover for its human rights abuses, just as the 1936 Berlin games boosted Hitler's regime'' (CNN news, 2001) .",
