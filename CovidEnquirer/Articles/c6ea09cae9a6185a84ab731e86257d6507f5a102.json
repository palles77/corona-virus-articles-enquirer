However, HIV-1 can escape from RNAimediated antiviral therapy by selection of mutations in the targeted sequence. To prevent viral escape, multiple small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against conserved viral sequences should be combined. Ideally, these RNA inhibitors should be expressed simultaneously from a single transgene transcript.",

Individual anti-HIV miRNAs that resemble the natural miRNA structures were optimized by varying the siRNA position in the hairpin stem to obtain maximal effectiveness against luciferase reporters and HIV-1. We show that an antiviral miRNA construct can have a greater intrinsic inhibitory activity than a conventional short hairpin (shRNA) construct. When combined in a polycistron setting, the silencing activity of an individual miRNA is strongly boosted. We demonstrate that HIV-1 replication can be efficiently inhibited by simultaneous expression of four antiviral siRNAs from the polycistronic miRNA transcript. These combined results indicate that a multiplex miRNA strategy may be a promising therapeutic approach to attack escape-prone viral pathogens.",

Pre-miRNAs are transported by Exportin-5 to the cytoplasm, where they are cleaved by Dicer to produce the miRNA duplex of $22 bp. The single-stranded mature miRNA programs RISC for mRNA cleavage (perfect complementarity) or translational repression (incomplete complementarity) (13, 14) . Several miRNAs are encoded in genomic clusters that are transcribed as polycistronic pri-miRNAs, allowing the production of multiple miRNAs from a single transcription unit (15, 16) . RNAi can be induced using RNA polymerase III promoterdriven shRNA expression vectors that direct siRNA expression. Another siRNA expression strategy uses a pre-miRNA backbone that is transcribed by polymerase II or III (17) (18) (19) (20) .

For HIV-1, potent inhibition has been reported with single shRNA and miRNA expression constructs (17, (26) (27) (28) . However, the therapeutic use of a single inhibitor is limited because of the rapid emergence of HIV-1 escape mutants (27, 29, 30) .

            "text": "Strategies to reduce the chance of viral escape include the simultaneous use of multiple shRNAs in a combinatorial RNAi approach, which increases the genetic barrier for viral escape (31, 32) . Similar strategies have previously been validated for antisense DNA and ribozymes (33) (34) (35) . However, expression of these shRNAs necessitates multiple expression cassettes and the construction of rather complex vectors that will not easily provide equimolar shRNA expression levels. Furthermore, when the same promoter is reiterated in a lentiviral vector, recombination occurs with high frequency on the repeated sequences (36) . Alternative antiescape strategies include the use of a second-generation of siRNAs that target-specific escape variants (37) , the use of tandem siRNA transcripts (38) , long hairpin RNAs (39) or the targeting of cellular co-factors that are critically involved in viral replication (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) . Another attractive approach is to express multiple antiviral siRNAs from a single polycistronic miRNA transcript, such as a natural genomic miRNA cluster that can be expressed from an RNA polymerase II promoter. This strategy is of particular interest for antiviral purposes because miRNAlike transcripts were shown to be more effective antivirals than regular shRNAs (17, 45) . Furthermore, using an RNA polymerase II promoter will allow lower and regulated expression, thereby reducing the risk of toxicity due to oversaturation of the RNAi machinery (46) .",

To generate this transcript, we first constructed individual anti-HIV miRNAs that resemble the natural pri-miRNA structures. These hairpins were optimized for viral inhibition by varying the siRNA position in the hairpin stem. We show that the expression of individual miRNAs is greatly enhanced in multiplex hairpin transcripts that are properly processed into functional miRNAs. HIV-1 replication can be potently inhibited by simultaneous expression of four antiviral miRNAs. These combined results indicate that the multiplex miRNA strategy is a promising therapeutic approach against escape-prone viral pathogens.",

The mir-17-19b polycistron sequence was verified and is identical to the sequence in the NCBI database (NT_009952.14). The TOPO2.1/mir-17-19b construct was used as a template to generate the antiviral miRNA constructs. The construction consists of a four-step fusion PCR as shown in the Supplementary Figure 1 . Briefly, the 5 0 -flank of the pri-miRNA was amplified with a forward primer encoding a BamHI site and a reverse primer encoding the HIV-1 sequence at its 3 0 -end (step 1). Similarly, the 3 0 -flank of the pri-miRNA was amplified with a forward primer containing HIV-1 sequences and a reverse primer encoding BglII and XhoI sites (step 2). Two complementary oligonucleotides, creating the stem-loop structure of the antiviral miRNA, were annealed as described previously (step 3) (32) . The partial sequence similarity between the fragments generated in steps 1, 2 and 3 allowed their fusion by PCR with the outer forward F1 and reverse R2 primers (step 4), resulting in the antiviral miRNA. Supplementary Table 1 lists all oligonucleotides used in this study. PCR amplification was performed in a 50 ml reaction containing 1 \u00c2 PCR amplification buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5-2 mM MgCl 2 (optimized for each reaction), 25 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystem). The PCR program was as follows: 958C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 2 min at 948C, 1.5 min at 608C, 2.5 min at 728C and a final extension for 8 min at 728C. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and compared to a standard DNA size marker (Eurogentec). miRNA PCR products were excised from gel, purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned in the corresponding sites of pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR (Invitrogen).

Cellular debris was removed by filtration through a FP30/0.45 CA-S filter (Schleicher and Schuell MicroScience) and 1-ml aliquots were stored at \u00c0808C. Lentiviral stocks were titrated on SupT1 and 293T cells to determine the vector titer. SupT1 and 293T cells (1 \u00c2 10 5 ) were transduced with the pLV vector expressing an unrelated miRNA N (Invitrogen) or the antiviral miRNAs A pol47 , B pol1 , C gag5 , D r/t5 , E ldr9 and ACDE at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.15 as described previously (32) . The pLV vector contains the blasticidin resistance gene, which allows the selection of transduced cells using 3.5 mg/ml blasticidin. The GFP marker encoded by the miRNA cassette was used to select GFP+ cells by FACS sorting approximately 10 days post-transduction.",

For the initial experiments we chose miRNAs miR-20 and miR-19b (D wt and E wt ) because they contain the smallest number of bulges and thus most resemble the original shRNA structure ( Figure 2 ). The original mature miRNA and the antiviral miRNA strand are boxed. We modified the passenger strand of the basepaired stem to mimic structural features (mismatches, bulges and thermodynamic stability) of the natural pre-miRNA. We constructed a series of antiviral miRNAs with the effective r/t5 and ldr9 siRNAs in the D wt backbone, which produces the antiviral guide strand from the 5 0 side of the hairpin duplex. The 19-nt antiviral siRNAs were positioned either at the 5 0 (D r/t5-19 0 and D ldr9-19 0 ) or 3 0 -end (D r/t5-19 0 and D ldr9-19 0 ) of the original miRNA sequence (Figure 2 , upper panel). Additional constructs were made in which we extended the antiviral siRNAs at the 3 0 -end to 23-nt, which is the actual size of the wild-type mature miRNA (D r/t5-23 and D ldr9-23 ) ( Figure 2 , Table 1 ). We repeated this strategy for the r/t5 inhibitor in the E wt hairpin, which produces the antiviral guide strand from the 3 0 side of the hairpin stem ( Figure 2 , lower panel). We designed a similar set of constructs in which the 19-nt r/t5 siRNA was positioned at the 5 0 (E r/t5-19 0 ) or 3 0 -end (E r/t5-19 0 ) of the wild-type miRNA and an extended 23-nt version (E r/t5-23 ).",

We therefore wanted to compare the siRNA level expressed from each construct. We titrated 39-2500 ng sh r/t5 construct in 293T cells and compared that with 2500 ng D r/t5 construct. Two days post-transfection, total cellular RNA was isolated from the transfected cells and analyzed on a Northern blot with an r/t5 probe that detects the guide (antisense) strand ( Figure 4 ). The original D wt hairpin was used as a negative control. Quantification of the RNA bands showed that expression of the antiviral 19-nt siRNA by construct D r/t5 is about 15-30-fold lower than the expression by construct sh r/t5 (Figure 4 , see numbers below the blot). Although the siRNA expression level of D r/t5 is significantly lower than that of sh r/t5 , the inhibitory effect measured in the luciferase and HIV-1 inhibition assays is comparable. This result suggests that the intrinsic inhibitory capacity of D r/t5 is in fact much greater than that of sh r/t5 .",

We tested the ability of these hairpins to inhibit the Luc-A pol47 reporter ( Figure 5A , left). Firefly luciferase expression was normalized to the renilla luciferase expression from the co-transfected pRL plasmid. We set the luciferase expression in the presence of pBS at 100%. The knockdown efficiency of the single A pol47 hairpin was $40%, but chaining it with the B wt hairpin or the A wt -E wt cluster enhanced the silencing activity. As a negative control, we included the A wt -E wt construct. As a positive control, we included the original shRNA. A similar pattern was observed for inhibition of HIV-1 production ( Figure 5A, right) . Thus, expression of a miRNA inhibitor as part of a miRNA polycistronic transcript enhances the silencing activity. Next, we constructed polycistronic hairpin constructs with different combinations of two, three or four hairpins of the miRNA inhibitors A pol47 , B pol1 , C gag5 , D r/t5 and E ldr9 : AB, AC, AD, ACC, ACD, ACCD, ACDE and ACDB wt . We first determined the knockdown efficiency of each individual hairpin within the multiplex transcripts by co-transfection with the corresponding luciferase reporter into 293T cells ( Figure 5B, Supplementary Table 2 ). Constructs encoding the A wt -E wt cistron and individual wild-type or non-matching miRNAs were used as negative controls.

Construct B pol1 does not exhibit any inhibitory activity, either alone or when combined with another hairpin as in AB. Since the B pol1 hairpin structure is rather unstable as predicted by the Mfold algorithm, this could be due to misfolding of the hairpin RNA. We therefore will not use hairpin B pol1 in the final polycistron construct. Hairpin D r/t5 does not benefit from linkage to other hairpins, but this is likely due to the high inhibitory activity of the individual D r/t5 inhibitor. Strong inhibition of Luc-D r/t5 was observed with D r/t5 , AD, ACD, ACCD and ACDE, indicating that generation of effective siRNAs from the multiplex hairpin transcripts does not depend on the miRNA position in the polycistron. We further tested the ability of the antiviral miRNAs to inhibit HIV-1 by co-transfection with the HIV-1 molecular clone LAI ( Figure 5C, Supplementary Table 2) . Consistent with the luciferase results, we observed a moderate HIV-1 inhibition by the single miRNA constructs, except for construct B pol1 (inactive) and D r/t5 (highly active) ( Figure 5C ). Multimerization of the hairpins strongly enhanced the inhibition of HIV-1 production, which is due both to enhancement of the silencing activity of the individual hairpins and to the presence of multiple antiviral siRNAs. The A wt -E wt construct was used as a negative control and the shRNA constructs were used as positive controls.",

The results are remarkably similar to the activity data in Figure 5 . For instance, siRNA expression of A pol47 is greatly increased by linkage to another hairpin as in AD ( Figure 6A ). The Northern blot analysis of the B pol1 and the AB inhibitors provides an explanation for its inactivity as only the $60-nt B pol1 precursor is observed ( Figure 6B , indicated by an arrow). To study whether the passenger siRNA strand of B pol1 is made, we performed a Northern blot analysis with the corresponding probe, but failed to detect any passenger siRNAs (results not shown). In contrast, properly processed siRNAs are produced from hairpin A pol47 in construct AB, indicating that the inactive B unit in the two-hairpin transcript does not negatively influence the active A unit ( Figure 6A and B) . In addition, siRNA production from the A hairpin is boosted for the polycistronic transcripts compared to the single A pol47 hairpin transcript. For inhibitor C gag5 , we also observed a strong increase in siRNA production when the hairpin is combined with other hairpins in a polycistronic transcript ( Figure 6C ). The D r/t5 inhibitor is expressed individually and does not benefit from chaining to other hairpins ( Figure 6D ), which correlates nicely with the luciferase results ( Figure 5B ). For inhibitor E ldr9 , we observed increased siRNA levels for ACDE compared to the single hairpin ( Figure 6E ).

We maintained the secondary structure of the original pre-miRNAs and included the single-stranded flanks because these are important for proper miRNA processing and subsequent RISC loading (12) . We used the CMV promoter to express the transcripts because most primary miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (7) , which also allows inducible or tissue-specific miRNA expression (22, 53, 54) . Previously, several reports have demonstrated effective gene knockdown in mammalian cells with siRNAs derived from miRNA precursors (17, 18, 22, 53) . However, none of these studies addressed the issue that a mature miRNA is typically 22-24 nt, whereas an siRNA is only 19-nt in length.

We therefore addressed whether the miRNA-like inhibitor is correctly processed and compared the amount of siRNA produced from the miRNA versus shRNA constructs. The siRNA level produced by the shRNA construct sh r/t5 is 15-30-fold higher than the D r/t5 miRNA, which is likely due to the use of different promoters (RNA polymerase III versus RNA polymerase II). Interestingly, the shRNA inhibitor did only show marginally higher inhibitory activity, suggesting that the intrinsic inhibitory activity of the miRNA-like inhibitor is in fact much greater than the shRNA variant. Consistent with these results, vectors encoding hairpin structures that closely resemble a natural pre-miRNA produced $12-fold more mature siRNAs than vectors encoding simple hairpin structures (21) . The superior activity of natural miRNA-like inhibitors is likely attributed by the intrinsic properties of a miRNA, which is processed in the nucleus by Drosha, exported to the cytoplasm, processed further by Dicer and loaded into RISC. In the case of an shRNA, the Drosha step is bypassed, which could provide a less-efficient entry into the RNAi pathway.",

            "text": "Moderate HIV-1 inhibitory activity was observed with constructs expressing a single miRNA hairpin. Interestingly, we demonstrate that co-expression of two or more hairpins in a single transcript greatly enhanced the silencing activity of each individual hairpin in the transcript. Northern blot analyses showed that the increased inhibitory activity correlates with higher siRNA expression levels. Multimerization of different miRNA hairpins is of particular interest for targeting of RNA viruses such as HIV-1 and HCV because of their extreme genetic diversity and potential for mutational escape. Two recent papers presented the potential of combinatorial RNAi using two miRNA-30 hairpins (55, 56) . In agreement with these studies, we showed an increase in RNAi activity upon multimerization of 2, 3, 4 or 6 hairpins in a single transcript. Another study used the miR-30 backbone to multiplex artificial miRNAs and reported decreased RNAi activity for the tandem plasmid, which may be due to miRNA processing problems (57 studied extensively. Our study focuses on the natural mir-17-92 polycistron and we demonstrate that insertion of four antiviral siRNAs creates a transcript that is properly processed into functional antiviral miRNAs that effectively inhibit HIV-1 production and replication. A major concern of the miRNA approach is the offtarget effect on cellular transcripts with partial sequence complementarity. Such an off-target effect may require only a complementarity of 6-8 nt between the seed region of the miRNA and the target (58, 59) . Such a weak restraint results in numerous potential off-target genes for any miRNA. When multiple miRNAs are used, the number of potential off-targets will increase, increasing the chance of a negative effect on the treated cells. However, we observed no obvious cellular changes in a sensitive toxicity screen. Furthermore, the observed inhibition of firefly luciferase reporters clearly showed sequence-specificity as non-matching miRNAs did not have any effect and the expression of the control renilla reporter was not affected. Another study, in which artificial miRNAs were expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, conferred viral resistance without cellular alterations, suggesting that off-target effects are not significant (60) . Furthermore, recently evidence emerges that siRNA sequences inserted in a miRNA backbone do not compete for transport and incorporation into RISC, while competition was observed when the same siRNA sequences were presented as synthetic siRNAs or shRNAs (61) . Nonetheless, off-targeting is a genuine concern for the development of any RNAi-based gene therapy against HIV-1 and the potential risk should be assessed properly in relevant in vivo models prior to an eventual clinical application (62) .",

These data, together with our previous shRNA studies (32, 63) , indicate that a combinatorial RNAi approach against HIV-1 results in an increased magnitude of inhibition and consequently a restriction of viral escape. Current strategies combine multiple polymerase III shRNA expression cassettes (63) , which results in high expression levels. This may not always be desired in a gene therapy setting because of increased toxicity due to saturation of the RNAi machinery with siRNAs (46) . The use of polymerase II promoters to express the miRNA polycistron will reduce this risk because of lower expression levels. In addition, polymerase II cassettes allow expression in a tissue-specific manner and inducible gene expression, which increases the flexibity for gene therapy and functional genomic applications (22, 54) .",

An interesting candidate is the WAS promoter that is active in human hematopoietic precursor cells (CD34+) and T lymphocytes, B cells and dendritic cells (64) . Another intriguing possibility is to use the HIV-1 LTR promoter to express the miRNA polycistron. Transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR requires the viral Tat protein, which is produced only in HIV-1-infected cells, thereby allowing exquisite target cell specificity. This approach has previously been employed for shRNA expression (65) . Thus, several approaches can be tested experimentally in order to optimize the antiviral miRNA polycistron strategy for HIV-1 inhibition.",

Untransduced SupT1 cells and cells transduced with the unrelated miRNA N were used as negative controls. Cells expressing an extended triple shRNA construct (e-shRNA 3) serve as positive control. SupT1 cells stably expressing miRNAs A pol47 , B pol1 , C gag5 , D r/t5 , E ldr9 and ACDE were infected with HIV-1 and virus replication was monitored for 7 days by measuring CA-p24 in the culture supernatant. One representative experiment is shown, similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.",

(C) Inhibition of HIV-1 production by the miRNA constructs. 293T cells were co-transfected with 150 ng pLAI, 1 ng pRL and 5 ng 1, 2, 3 or 4 miRNA constructs. Two days post-transfection, CA-p24 levels in the culture supernatant and renilla luciferase expression were measured. Normalized CA-p24 level in the absence of inhibitor was set at 100%. Mean values obtained in four independent experiments are shown (AESE).",
