Although these enteropathogens may not always cause diarrhoea, Garc\u00eda et al. (2000) showed a strong association between the presence of one of these intestinal agents and diarrhoea. Clostridium perfringens (Cl. perfringens) is considered as an important human and veterinary enteropathogen because these gram positive, anaerobe bacteria produce endotoxins. Cl. perfringens has been reported to play a role in a broad array of enteric and histotoxic infections (Petit et al., 1999; Smedley et al., 2004) and cause enterotoxaemia in both dairy cows and calves (Muskens et al., 2007; Lebrun et al., 2007) .",

In 2007, the median herd size was 70 dairy cows (interquartile range 45-90 cows) and assuming a year-round calving pattern, a mean of 6 (range 4-8) calves were born each month. Based on this estimation, we decided to visit a minimum of 70 herds in order to collect at least 400 faecal samples.

Rectal faecal samples were taken with a new plastic glove from each individual calf. Subsequently, the faecal samples were scored for consistency and collected in a plastic pot. For the evaluation of faecal consistency the following criteria were definedscore of faeces = 0 or 'normal': firm consistency, brown colour, perineum and tail of the calf is clean and dry; score = 1 or 'custard-like': a paste-like consistency, yellow colour and perineum and/or tail of the calf is smeared with faeces; score = 2 or diarrhoea: watery consistency, perineum and/or tail of the calf is smeared with watery faeces. Subsequently, a questionnaire was conducted asking about management practices. Herdsmen were asked about procedures related to housing (group or individual housing of calves, age in days at which calves were transferred to another housing system), on provision of colostrum (time after birth calves were first fed colostrum, quantity (litres) and frequency per day), provision of milk replacer (day of first provision, quantity (litres) per day), provision of roughage (first day of provision), cleaning procedures for boxes (frequency of cleaning) and utensils (cleaning of utensils with cold or hot water, use of soap or detergents), treatment procedures for diarrhoeic calves (preventive use of antibiotics (yes/no), curative use of antibiotics (yes/no), use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) (yes/no)) and nursing procedures (same person taking care of calves all the time (yes/no), use of specific clothing when caring for the calves (yes/no)). In addition, the feeding regime on the day of sampling was asked (milk replacer or bulk milk or individual cow milk or water or ORS). Before the start of the study, both investigators were simultaneously trained in two herds by a bovine health specialist in order to standardize the use of clinical scores. Additionally, three herds were visited to evaluate the structure and the flow of the questions.",

To our knowledge, no studies have previously estimated the prevalence or incidence of 'custard-like' faeces. Since we used a cross-sectional study design, it was not possible to verify cause-effect relationships. However, we demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between the detection of Rotavirus and C. parvum in the faeces of calves and the occurrence of 'custard-like' faeces. Applying Bayes' rule to these results gave a 0.31 probability of detecting Rotavirus in 1-week, and 0.66 probability of detecting C. parvum in 2-week-old calves with 'custard-like' faeces. As C. parvum and Rotavirus are both considered to be causes of neonatal diarrhoea (Tzipori, 1985; de Graaf et al., 1999; Garc\u00eda et al., 2000; Uhde et al., 2008) , it could be hypothesized that 'custardlike' faeces might act as an intermediate step in the development of neonatal diarrhoea. The prevalence of diarrhoea was highest in the second week of age. In a previous Dutch study, the cumulative incidence of diarrhoea in calves between 1 and 21 days was estimated to be 24.0% (Perez et al., 1990) with the peak incidence of diarrhoea being within the first 2 weeks. In a Canadian study, the rate of diarrhoea between birth and weaning was estimated to be 20% (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986b) . Given these and our estimates of diarrhoea, it seems that the occurrence of diarrhoea has remained stable over time. Apparently little progress has been achieved in reducing its occurrence.",

Previous research has indicated a role for E. coli (ETEC) in the occurrence of neonatal diarrhoea (Bendali et al., 1999) but little is known about its prevalence. In general, E. coli is shed during a short period of time which results in a low prevalence while its incidence and thus impact on calf morbidity and/or mortality might be relatively high. In our study, we did not find a statistical association between E. coli prevalence and calf mortality. However, 14 herds (13%) used vaccination against diarrhoea, including protection against E. coli and this will have underestimated the E. coli prevalence.",

We found a similar result in our study: there was no statistical association between the presence of nonnormal faeces and Coronavirus. However, we did find a strong relationship between the detection of Coronavirus and previous antimicrobial treatment of calves in the past. A possible explanation might be that Coronavirus is an opportunistic infection that occurs when calves have previously had episodes of diarrhoea and were treated for bacterial infections. Additionally, consistent cleaning of the housing area for calves was a protective factor for calves shedding Coronavirus. This result stresses the importance of good hygienic procedures in calf-rearing facilities.",

The results of several studies in dairy herds have indicated that C. parvum is very common among dairy calves (Garber et al., 1994; de la Fuente et al., 1999; Olson et al., 1999; Ruest et al., 1998; Sischo et al., 2000; Trotz-Williams et al., 2005) with apparent animal prevalences ranging from 15% to 48% for calves between 0 and 3 weeks of age. In these studies, over 60% of herds had one or more infected calves. Trotz-Williams et al. (2008) recently highlighted that most of the variation in shedding occurred between herds, rather than within herds. This indicates that herd-level risk factors, rather than calf-related factors, are important to effectively control C. parvum (Trotz-Williams et al., 2008) . Our study confirmed this: the ICC for C. parvum shedding was as high as 0.33.",
