The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R 0 <1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of COVID-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combinations of efficacy that can induce herd protection (R 0 <1). With the emergence of the novel viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2, of clear potential for a global pandemic with high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems, the question of prevention has critical priority. We come to the conclusion that isolating symptomatic cases and tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people. We show that first-degree instantaneous contact tracing, informing users when they can move safely or when to seek medical help and avoid vulnerable individuals, has the potential to stop the spread of the epidemic if used by a sufficiently large number of people with reasonable fidelity.

Human-to-human transmission was initially focused in the Hubei province of China, but has now seeded growing epidemics around the world. The virus is likely of bat origin, with a possible intermediate animal host, and most of the first documented cases were linked to environmental exposure in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in early December 2019. The virus is sufficiently genetically similar to the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus that it is reasonable to expect some aspects of epidemiology to be similar, and then update these views as new data emerge. So far, new analyses indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious and less virulent than SARS-CoV-1, and could have greater epidemic potential due to greater difficulties in tracing mild or asymptomatic infections. No treatment is currently available, and while the development of a vaccine is proceeding as fast as possible, the need to test any candidates for safety in humans means that vaccines will not be available for several months at the earliest. The only tools that we currently have to stop the epidemic are those of classical epidemic control, like contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine. The aim of this paper is to explore the feasibility of achieving herd protection (R 0 <1) using isolation coupled to classical contact tracing by questionnaires and people versus algorithmic instantaneous contact tracing assisted by a phone app.",

Rather than comparing transmission through these different physical routes, here we compare different transmission routes that are more closely aligned to their implications for prevention. Specifically we propose four categories. 1. Symptomatic transmission: direct transmission from a symptomatic individual, through a contact that can be readily recalled by the recipient. 2. Pre-symptomatic transmission: direct transmission from an individual that occurs before the source individual experiences noticeable symptoms. (Note that this definition may be context specific, for example based on whether it is the source or the recipient who is asked whether the symptoms were noticeable.) 3. Asymptomatic transmission: direct transmission from individuals who never experience noticeable symptoms. This can only be established by follow-up, as single time-point observation cannot fully distinguish asymptomatic from pre-symptomatic individuals. 4. Environmental transmission: transmission via contamination, and specifically in a way that would not typically be attributable to contact with the source in a contact survey (i.e. we exclude from this transmission pairs who were in extended close contact, but for whom in reality the infectious dose passed via the environment instead of more directly). These could be identified in an analysis of spatial movements. We acknowledge that boundaries between these categories may be blurred, but these broadly have different implications for prevention. These will be spelled out in future work on modelling different prevention approaches, and may be mapped to other modelling studies, some old and general ( 5 ) ( 6 ) and one more specific to COVID-19 ( 7 ) .",

After closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market on January 1st, of 240 cases with no exposure to any wet market, 200 individuals (83%) reported no exposure to an individual with respiratory symptoms.

By devoting considerable resources including police investigation, 75 of the 92 cases of local transmission have been traced back to their presumed exposure, either to a known case or to a location linked to spread (https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com/covid-19/coronavirus-singapore-clusters.html?cid=FBcna). However, linking two cases generally includes the possibility that one infected the other pre-symptomatically and only later became symptomatic; furthermore, linking cases via a location generally includes the possibility of environmentally mediated transmission. Therefore the large fraction of traceable transmission here does not contradict the large fraction without symptomatic exposure in Wuhan. A conservative reading of the Singapore data serves only as evidence against a large role of asymptomatic transmission.",

We also fit a mathematical model of infectiousness, through the four routes discussed above, over the course of infection.

We note that this assumption is implicit in many estimates of R 0 . The epidemic doubling time T 2 , equal to log e (2) / r , was previously estimated as 7.4 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.2 to 14) from data on the first 425 cases in Wuhan ( 8 ) , and independently as 7.2 days (95% credible interval 4.7 to 16.3) by phylodynamic analysis of 86 whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-129-genomes-24-feb-2020/356 ). We analysed the former data source together with the China Centre for Disease Control counts of daily confirmed cases (http://2019ncov.chinacdc.cn/2019-nCoV/), visually identified two periods of consistent early exponential growth, and obtained a more precise combined estimate of T 2 = 5.0 days (95% CI 4.3 to 6.2).

The generation time is defined for source-recipient transmission pairs as the time between the infection of the source and the infection of the recipient. Because time of infection is generally not known, the generation time is often approximated by the (clinical onset) serial interval, which is defined as the time between the onset of symptoms of the source and the onset of symptoms of the recipient. We did not take that approach here: we directly estimated the generation time distribution from 40 source-recipient pairs for whom direct transmission is suspected, and where time of onset of symptoms is known for both source and recipient. We combined dates of symptom onset with intervals of exposure for both source and recipient (when available) and the above distribution of incubation times, and inferred the distribution of generation times.

We provide two approaches suggesting that between a third and a half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic individuals. Our infectiousness model suggests that the total contribution to R0 from pre-symptomatics is 0.9 (0.2 -1.1). For SARS, the corresponding estimate was almost zero ( 5 ) , immediately telling us that different containment strategies will be needed for COVID-19. While preparing this manuscript, results supporting a large role for pre-symptomatic submission were shared: Tindale et al. found that serial intervals in Tianjin and Singapore were on average 2-3 days shorter than incubation periods ( https://github.com/carolinecolijn/ClustersCOVID19/blob/master/COVID_19_Singapore_Tianjin_analysi sSUPP-joined.pdf ), consistent with our estimate of a shorter generation time.",

For SARS, there were seemingly almost no asymptomatic infections ( 18 ) , whereas asymptomatic infection has been widely reported for COVID-19, e.g. ( 10 ) . We argue that the reports from Singapore imply that even if asymptomatic infections are common, onward transmission from this state is probably uncommon, since forensic reconstruction of the transmission networks has closed down most missing links. There is an important caveat to this: the Singapore outbreak to date is small, and has not implicated children. There is widespread speculation that children could be frequent asymptomatic carriers and potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 ( 19 ) , a finding that is being urgently explored.",

We make that assumption here. This assumption would be violated by biased selection of transmission pairs for sampling. For example if the infector being in a later, symptomatic stage of infection makes identification of the pair more likely, then a data set of identified pairs will be undersampled for pre-symptomatic exposure and will overestimate the typical generation time. The next step in solving the model was calculating the relative scaling constant of the environmental contribution to ( ) to give the required R E /R 0 , and finally the overall scaling constant of ( ) is determined to reproduce the observed exponential growth rate (see Supplementary Information) .",
