They cause major economic loss, sometimes associated with high mortality, in neonates of some domestic species (e.g., chickens, pigs). In humans, they are responsible for respiratory and enteric diseases. Coronaviruses do not necessarily observe species barriers, as illustrated most graphically by the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus among wild animals and to man, with lethal consequences. As a group, coronaviruses are not limited to particular organs; target tissues include the nervous system, immune system, kidney, and reproductive tract in addition to many parts of the respiratory and enteric systems. A great advance in recent years has been the development of systems ('infectious clones') for modifying the genomes of coronaviruses to study all aspects of coronavirus replication, and for the development of new vaccines.",

It is believed that when the polymerase producing the nascent negative sense RNA, reaches a TRS, RNA synthesis is attenuated, followed by continuation at the 5 0 end of genomic RNA. This results in the addition of a negative copy of the leader sequence to the negative-sense RNA, resulting in a negative-sense copy of an sg mRNA. Of course, progress of the polymerase is not always halted at a TRS. Rather, it sometimes continues, producing a nested set of negativesense sg mRNAs. These are the templates for the generation of the positive-sense sg mRNAs ( Figure 2 ). The amount of each sg mRNA does not necessarily decrease in a linear fashion; the efficiency of termination by a TRS is dependent on adjacent sequences, which are different for each gene.

Both subunits The leader sequence, represented by a gray box, is at the 5 0 end of the genomic RNA and at the 5 0 ends of the sg mRNAs.

The structural proteins, S, E, M, and E, and the accessory proteins, 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b, produced from IBV genes 3 and 5, respectively, are translated from the sg mRNAs. The proteins produced by the sg mRNAs are represented by lines below the corresponding sg mRNA.

The ribosome frameshift (RFS) region, denoted as a black circle on the genomic RNA, directs the -1 frameshift event for the synthesis of pp1ab. Translation of the genomic RNA results in the production of pp1a. However, the translating ribosomes undergo the -1 frameshift about 30% of the time resulting in pp1ab.

The negative-sense RNAs are used as templates for the synthesis of genomic RNA and sg mRNAs (Figure 2) . Following synthesis of the sg mRNAs, the structural proteins are produced for the assembly and encapsidation of the de novo-synthesized genomic RNA, resulting in the release of new infectious coronavirus virions. The release of new virions starts 3-4 h after the initial infection. As indicated above, the synthesis of the sg mRNAs is the result of a discontinuous process in which the synthesis of a negative-sense copy of an sg mRNA is completed by the addition of the negative-sense leader sequence by a recombination mechanism. If a cell is infected with two related coronaviruses, the polymerase may swap between two RNA templates, in a similar way to addition of the leader sequence. This 'copy-choice' mechanism of genetic recombination results in a chimeric RNA.

This has been elegantly demonstrated by genetic manipulation of the genome of MHV, which is unable to attach to feline cells. Replacement of the MHV S protein gene with that of CoV from feline coronavirus resulted in a recombinant virus that was able to attach, and subsequently replicate in, feline cells. However, other proteins can also affect pathogenicity. Research with genetically modified coronaviruses, using targeted recombination or 'infectious clones', has shown that modifications to proteins encoded in ORF1 and the small genes interspersed among the structural protein genes, result in attenuation of pathogenicity. Although the roles of these 'accessory proteins' are not known, this may offer a route to the development of a new generation of live vaccines. Currently, the most widely used prophylactics for control of IBV in chickens include killed vaccines and live vaccines attenuated by passage in embryonated eggs. However, disease control is complicated by extensive variation in the S1 protein which is the inducer of protective immunity. Figure 4 Phylogenetic relationship of aligned coronavirus-derived nucleoprotein amino acid sequences. The complete N protein sequences represent coronaviruses from each of the three groups ( Table 1) . The tree is unrooted and the three main coronavirus groups, 1-3, are highlighted as dark gray ellipsoids. Groups 1 and 2 are divided into two subgroups, a and b, representing some divergence of the sequences within their corresponding groups. Similar relationships are observed when comparing other structural proteins and replicase-derived proteins.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) were first identified during the 1960s by using electron microscopy to visualize the distinctive spike glycoprotein projections on the surface of enveloped virus particles. It was quickly recognized that CoV infections are quite common, and that they are responsible for seasonal or local epidemics of respiratory and gastrointestinal disease in a variety of animals. CoVs have been named according to the species from which they were isolated and the disease associated with the viral infection. Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infects chickens, causing respiratory infection, decreased egg production, and mortality in young birds. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) causes respiratory and gastrointestinal disease in cattle. Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) cause gastroenteritis in pigs. These CoV infections can be fatal in young animals. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV) can cause severe disease in cats and dogs. Depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection, the murine CoV mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) can cause hepatitis or a demyelinating disease similar to multiple sclerosis. CoVs also infect humans. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229e and OC43 are detected worldwide and are estimated to be responsible for 5-30% of common colds and mild gastroenteritis. Interestingly, HCoV-OC43 and BCoV share considerable sequence similarity, indicating a likely transmission across species (either from cows to humans or vice versa) and then adaptation of the virus to its host. In contrast to the relatively mild infections caused by HCoV-229e and HCoV-OC43, the CoV responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) causes atypical pneumonia with a 10% mortality rate. Two additional HCoVs, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, have been recently identified using molecular methods and are associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children, and elderly",
