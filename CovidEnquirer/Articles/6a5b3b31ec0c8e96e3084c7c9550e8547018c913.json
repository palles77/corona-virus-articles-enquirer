Calves were separated from the dam and fed 2 L of colostrum in nipple-bottles or allowed to nurse the dam for 3 d. Calves were housed in individual hutches or wooden pens in a bam. Intake of colostrum by calves allowed to nurse the dam was not controlled. Serum IgG and IgM concentrations at 24 h of age were greater for calves that nursed the dam. Scours were less severe when calves were housed in hutches, but number of days scouring was unaffected by treatment. Calves fed colostrum in nipple-bottles and housed in the bam consumed more starter than did other calves from 3 to 5 wk of age. The BW were greater for calves allowed to nurse the dam and housed in hutches. Feed efficiency over the 35-d study was Received May 5. 1994.

Other organisms measured did not significantly contribute to incidence or severity of scours. The coefficient for mean daily BW gain was negative in all regressions, indicating that increasing incidence or severity of scours reduced BW gain. The highly negative coefficient for mean daily BW gain in regression of days x severity (Table 2) indicated that BW gain was markedly reduced when scouring was severe or lasted for an extended period. Serum IgG and IgM concentrations and colostral IgG concentration were significant in one or more regression equations, reemphasizing the importance of transfer of passive immunity to minimize the incidence and severity of scours. Serum IgM was related to incidence of scours, number of days of scouring, and interaction of days x severity; serum IgG was related to incidence and severity of scours. Milk replacer intake was negatively related (P < .01) to incidence and severity of scours because milk replacer was refused only when calves scoured severely.

Intakes of calf starter, DM, and CP over the 35-d study were greater for calves fed colostrum in nipple-bottles (fable 4). An interaction of colostrum feeding x housing tended toward significance (P < .10), indicating that calves fed colostrum in nipple-bottles and housed in the barn consumed more calf starter, DM, and CP than other calves. Multivariate ANOVA of starter intake regression coefficients (fable 5) indicated a significant effect of housing on the change in starter intake during the study. Calves housed in the barn, but particularly those fed colostrum in nipple-bottles, consumed more starter than other calves, primarily during the last wk 3 of the study. Also, during wk 5, starter intake did not increase as rapidly when calves were housed in the barn, as indicated by the more highly negative cubic regression coefficients (-86 vs. -15; P < .01). Decreasing rate of increase in starter consumption during wk 5 may have been due to greater prevalence of Eimeria in feces of calves housed in the barn during wk 4 and 5. Although weekly fecal scores were not markedly increased by the prevalence of Eimeria, damage to intestinal epithelium may influence intake and digestibility (9) . Mean daily intake of decoquinate was .01, .04, .18, .37, and .47 mglkg of BW from wk 1 to 5, respectively, which was lower than the amount (.5 mglkg of BW) required to minimize incidence of coccidiosis in dairy calves, although smaller amounts may partially suppress fecal oocyst discharge and diarrhea (20) .

Although allowing calves to nurse the dam can increase the potential for failure of transfer of passive immunity, assisting calves to nurse the dam may alleviate some problems associated with failure to suckle or delayed suckling. However, the amount of time and management required to assist calves to suckle may preclude widespread use of this practice. A recent survey of dairy producers in the US indicated that 13.8% of producers assisted calves in nursing the dam compared with 64% who fed first colostrum via bucket or botde, 19.9% that allowed unassisted nursing, and 2.3% that fed colostrum via esophageal feeder (7).",
