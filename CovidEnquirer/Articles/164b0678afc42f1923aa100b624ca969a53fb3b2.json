For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. As data become available, we subsequently analyzed them during three consecutive periods obtaining a sequence of model predictions. All available data up were processed the same way. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data. Using this model and the three sets of data, we estimated maximum cases as about 21,000, 28,000 and 35,000 cases refining these predictions in near-real time. With slightly different approach (linearization in time) the estimate of maximum cases was even higher (about 65,000). Although the estimates of maximum cases increase as more data were reported all models show reaching a peak in mid-February in contrast to the unconfined exponential growth. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.",

To manage the epidemics resulting from virus spreading across China and other countries forecasting the occurrence of future cases is extremely important. Such forecasting is very complicated and uncertain since many factors are poorly understood or estimated with a large possible error. Two major factors include spatial movement of virus carriers (i.e., infected individuals) and the basic reproduction number R0 (average number of new infections originated from an infected individual).",

An example of such linearization for Period 1 is shown in Figure 2 with the initial 16 points (blue points and line in Figure 2) . The same figure also shows linearization using for Period 2 (orange points and line in Figure 2 ). For all periods the effective reproduction numbers decrease in time. As new data were reported daily, we followed with subsequent analysis in near-real time with three periods as shown in Table 2 In contrast, a simple linearization of Re in time (Figure 3) back-estimated the original basic reproduction number R0 at about 2.4 to 2.5, agreeing well with other values recently reported Liu et al., 2020; Majumder & Mandl, 2020; Zhang & Wang, 2020a , 2020b Zhao et al., 2020a) . The discrepancy between these two estimates can be attributed a potential loss of virulence of the virus but most likely due to extreme measures to contain virus spread in China. .
