We reported the following; 1. the epidemic in China passed the peak in the beginning of February, 2. the date of the epidemic peak was different by region and was the latest in Wuhan. For more than 10 days after our forecast, the epidemic closely followed our forecast. The new patients outside Wuhan decreased to less than 4 % of that at the peak around February 5.",

Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of the Japanese government reported that the estimated number of patients who consulted doctors was about 12,000, 000 over the country (ref. 6). This estimated value was only 10 % of the population of Japan and far smaller than p(\u221e) = 77 %. There are three possibilities for the reason. The first is that most patients did not go to a hospital and the real number of patients was 92,400, 000. The second is that only 1/8 of the area in Japan was the reach of the pathogen. The third is a combination of the first and the second reasons. Thus, we realize the evaluation of the final size p(\u221e) is difficult. While reproduction of the epidemic by the model is fairly good near the peak of the epidemic, but at the far skirt, deviation of the data from the model is not negligible as seen in Fig.5 which shows a log plot of Fig.4.In the model fitting, the time constant was 1.15 weeks at the rising and the decay time constant was 1,7 weeks. Hence, \u03c4 grow calculated by Eq. (7) was 1.1 weeks. But in JpnInf2019, the reported number of patients increased exponentially with a time constant of 1.5 weeks and decreased exponentially at the ending stage with a time constant of 2.5 weeks.
