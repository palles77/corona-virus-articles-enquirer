            "text": "Background: There is good evidence that air pollution is a risk factor for adverse respiratory and vascular health outcomes. However, data are limited as to whether ambient fine particles contribute to the transmission of influenza and if so, how the association is modified by weather conditions. Objectives: We examined the relationship between ambient PM 2.5 and influenza incidence at the national level in China and explored the associations at different temperatures. Methods: Daily data on concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter b 2.5 \u03bcm (PM 2.5 ) and influenza incidence counts were collected in 47 Chinese cities. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the city-specific PM 2.5 -influenza association, after controlling for potential confounders. Then, a random-effect metaanalysis was used to pool the effects at national level. In addition, stratified analyses were performed to examine modification effects of ambient temperature. Results: For single lag models, the highest effect of ambient PM 2.5 on influenza incidence appeared at lag day 2, with relative risk (RR) of 1.015 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.004, 1.025) associated with a 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 . For moving average lag models, the significant association was found at lag 2-3 days, with RR of 1.020 (95% CI: 1.006, 1.034). The RR of influenza transmission associated with PM 2.5 was higher for cold compared with hot days. Overall, 10.7% of incident influenza cases may result from exposure to ambient PM 2.5 . Conclusions: Ambient PM 2.5 may increase the risk of exposure to influenza in China especially on cooler days. Control measures to reduce PM 2.5 concentrations could potentially also be of benefit in lowering the risk of exposure and subsequent transmission of influenza in China.",

Recent estimates suggest that annually air pollution in China kills N 1.5 million people each year, about 17% of the nation's annual deaths (Rohde and Muller, 2015) . One component of air pollution, in particular, is of increasing concern to public health experts; compared to other components, ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter b 2.5 \u03bcm (PM 2.5 ) is able to penetrate deep into the lung and into the circulatory system (S Feng et al., 2016) . Exposure to PM 2.5 is associated with a wide range of diseases including cardiovascular and respiratory disease (Arnold, 2014) . In 2013, the Global Burden of Disease group estimated that exposure to ambient PM 2.5 to be the 12th leading risk factor for the global burden of disease and responsible for 2.9 million deaths and 69.7 million disability adjusted life-years, worldwide (Forouzanfar et al., 2015) .",

Of particular concern, both nationally and globally, is the increasing threat posed by emerging infectious diseases (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] and the highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] ) in the Chinese population, both of which pose a significant public health threat (Wang et al., 2008) . Few studies have examined the possible effect of ambient PM 2.5 concentrations on risk of communicable disease in China, but those that have reported a positive association between ambient Environment International 98 (2017) 82-88 PM 2.5 and localised transmission of influenza (C. Huang et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2014) . However, until now there has been no large-scale examination of the association due to past unavailability of PM 2.5 data and incident cases of influenza at the national level. Neither has there been any detailed exploration of the possible effect of temperature on the transmissibility by ambient PM 2.5 of the influenza virus. In this study, we collected daily data on ambient PM 2.5 levels, weather conditions and influenza incidence from 47 cities in China in order to reliably determine the association between PM 2.5 and influenza incidence and the potential modification effects of ambient temperature on the relationship.",

China has established a web-based notifiable infectious disease management system linked with health administrative datasets, the disease control institution and the medical and health institutions at five levels: township, county (district), prefecture, province and national (Wang et al., 2008) . Influenza cases were defined according to Technical guides for prevention and control of influenza issued by China Ministry of Health (http://www.moh.gov.cn/zwgkzt/s9491/200802/38820.shtml): sudden onset of fever \u2265 38\u00b0C, cough or sore throat, and absence of other diagnoses. As influenza is a notifiable disease (Class C), sentinel hospitals are required to collect nasopharyngeal swabs for each identified case which are subsequently sent to designated laboratories for virus isolation and further identification and results are submitted online within 24 h (Liang et al., 2014; Shu et al., 2010) .",

The highest incidences of influenza occurred in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing, and the lowest incidences were observed in cities in the north eastern and central parts of China (Fig. 1) . The highest daily count of new cases of influenza (n = 32) was observed in Guangzhou city, Guangdong province whereas the lowest was in Xianning city, Hubei province. A summary of daily PM 2.5 concentrations, incident influenza and the weather conditions for each city are shown in Table S1 -S3 of the appendix. Table 1 shows the correlations between ambient PM 2.5 and the meteorological variables under investigation. PM 2.5 concentrations were negatively correlated with temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and hours of sunshine significantly (r = \u2212 0.31,-0.03, \u2212 0.25 and \u22120.12, respectively), but were positively correlated with atmospheric pressure significantly (r = 0.06). There was a strong correlation between relative humidity and hours of sunshine and weak correlations were observed between other meteorological factors. Fig. 2 shows the pooled results from the meta-analysis for different single lag models (lag 0 to lag 7). The effect of PM 2.5 on influenza was significant at lag days 2 and 3 (RR: 1.015 and 1.013; and 95% CI: 1.004, 1.025 and 1.003, 1.023, respectively). Thus, a moving average lag model at lag 2-3 days was performed to examine the cumulative effect across these two days. Fig. 3 shows the effect of ambient PM 2.5 on influenza at lag 2-3 days for each individual city and the overall pooled estimate at the national level. The effect estimates varied by city, with strong and significant effects observed in several cities in Southwest China and Central China including Guilin, Xianning, Kunming and Guangzhou. However, weak and insignificant effects were observed in cities located in Northeast China and South China including Shenyang, Changchun and Shenzhen. For the pooled estimate, the increased risk of influenza was significantly associated with an increase of 10 \u03bcg/m 3 in PM 2.5 at lag 2-3 days (RR: 1.020, 95% CI: 1.006, 1.034). Fig. 4 shows the results for the stratified analyses by temperature levels per 10 \u03bcg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 at lag day 2, lag day 3 and lag days' 2-3. Significant associations at lag days' 2-3 for cold days were observed (RR: 1.027, 95% CI: 1.010, 1.044), and a weaker, non-significant association was observed for hot days (RR: 0.982, 0.943, 1.023). For different lag types, the strongest effects were observed for cold days and the weakest effects for hot days. The effects on moderate cold and moderate hot days were similar. Table 2 shows the number and fraction of incident influenza that might related to ambient lag days' 2-3 PM 2.5 moving average concentrations. Overall, approximately 10% of incident cases of influenza during the study period may result from exposure to ambient PM 2.5 (PAF 10.72% [95% CI: 3.47%, 17.04%]). When stratified by temperature, the highest attributable fractions occurred on cold days (16.26, 95% CI: 6.67%, 24.53%). For moderate cold days and moderate hot days, the attributable fractions were similar. The effect of PM 2.5 on incident influenza was stronger on cold days than hot days at lag 2-3 days (Table S4 in appendix).",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between ambient PM 2.5 and influenza incidence at the national level utilising PM 2.5 monitoring data from 76 sites and influenza data obtained from surveillance systems from 47 cities throughout China. Our findings suggest that increased ambient PM 2.5 concentrations are associated with incident case of influenza at lag days 2 and 3 and that the effect is most apparent at lag day 2 when using single lag models. There was also evidence of a negative interaction with temperature such that the association between PM 2.5 and incident influenza was stronger at cooler temperatures.

Fine particles with viruses attached can also be inhaled resulting in the direct delivery of the viral agents to the respiratory epithelial cells (Chen et al., 2010; Jaspers et al., 2005) . Other studies which have examined how PM 2.5 exposure may impact on respiratory function and the inflammatory response, have reported that exposure to PM 2.5 is associated with dysfunction of the pulmonary tracheal cilia and decreased activity of alveolar macrophages (Wong et al., 2009; Xing, Xu, Shi, and Lian, 2016) which in turn may enhance an individual's susceptibility to viral agents.",

            "text": "Although there are some underlying theories explaining the seasonal patterns of influenza, there has been no consideration given to the possible modifying role of air pollution on the association. Air pollution exhibits a similar seasonal variation to influenza outbreaks; for example, in winter, higher concentrations of PM 2.5 have been reported possibly due to increased human activity and domestic heating leading to increased emissions (Kulshrestha, Satsangi, Masih, and Taneja, 2009) . Several studies have reported that ambient temperature may modify the associations between air pollution and health (Kim, Lim, and Kim, 2015; Stafoggia et al., 2008) , but whether this is also true for influenza has not been hitherto investigated. In our study, we observed stronger associations at cold temperatures, whereas there was no effect of high temperatures on the magnitude of the association between PM 2.5 and incident influenza. These results are consistent with earlier findings including the results of an experimental study that indicated that most frequent viral transmission occurred at 5\u00b0C and was halted at 30\u00b0C. It may be speculated that this reflects the inhibitory effect that cold air has on mucociliary clearance of the respiratory tract and greater viral stability in a low-temperature environment (Lowen, Mubareka, Steel, and Palese, 2007) both of which would enhance the transmissibility of the influenza virus. However, further studies are necessary before greater inference can be made. Disease surveillance systems in China have substantially improved since the SARS epidemic in 2003. The CISDCP is now the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system collecting real-time information about cases and virus subtypes and it provides essential and realtime information for policy makers (Wang et al., 2008) . Influenza cases reported in the system were defined according to national criteria and identified by both routine clinical and laboratory examination. However, under-reporting of influenza cases may have occurred, as some individuals with influenza may not have attended hospital and therefore not been captured by the hospital reporting system (C Feng et al., 2016) . Another limitation of the current study is that we did not have information on some demographic and behavioural factorssuch as age, gender and cigarette smokingwhich may be associated with incident influenza . However, the inability to include these covariates in the model is unlikely to have significantly confounded the association due to the lack of an association between these variables with PM 2.5 .",

Although most cases of influenza result in full recovery without serious complications, influenza contributes to the disease burden of communities and increases the risk of complications to the infection in the most vulnerable population subgroups (Livingston and Bernstein, 2015) . As a part of an integrated strategy for infectious disease control and prevention, the potential effect of environmental factors on disease transmission and infection should be taken into consideration. Findings from this study suggest that ambient PM 2.5 , particularly on cold days, increases the transmissibility of the influenza virus. Thus, following a period of heavy haze, preventive measures to prevent an increase in cases of influenza may be warranted both domestically and in neighbouring east Asian countries given the effect of emissions in China on surrounding countries (Kan, 2014) .",
