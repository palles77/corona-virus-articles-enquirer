            "text": "A new assay was developed for rapid and antemortem diagnosis of canine distemper (CD). This immunochromatography (IC)based assay, which employs two monoclonal anti-CDV antibodies, was compared with nested PCR. When serial dilutions of purified CDV were tested, the CDV detection limits of the nested PCR and IC assays were 2 \u00d7 10 2 TCID 50 /ml and 5 \u00d7 10 2 TCID 50 /ml, respectively. Nasal irrigation fluid, conjunctival swabs, and blood lymphocytes from 66 dogs suspected to have CD were tested . Preliminary IC experiments revealed that the optimal sample volume and reaction time were 100 l and 5 min, respectively. Relative to nested PCR, the sensitivity and specificity of the IC assay was maximal (100% and 100%, respectively) when conjunctival swabs were tested. This is significant because conjunctival swab specimens are easy to obtain in the early phase of CD infection. However, with blood lymphocytes and nasal samples, the IC assay was slightly less sensitive (89.7% and 85.7%, respectively) and specific (94.6% and 100%, respectively) than nested PCR. Since this novel IC assay does not require special instruments, it is a simple enough for dog owners to use. Since early detection of CD would allow appropriate treatment and quarantine to be instituted quickly, such a test would help reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with CD help to prevent its spread to other animals.",

Canine distemper (CD) is a highly contagious disease that affects dogs of all ages. It is associated with high morbidity and mortality and occurs worldwide. Dogs that have been infected naturally with CD show commonly systemic signs of the disease such as vomiting, diarrhoea and/or respiratory signs; sometimes they also exhibit generalized or localized myoclonus and the characteristic clin- * Corresponding author.

In the recent outbreaks of CD in Korea, the affected dogs could be classified clinically into two groups, namely, young dogs with CNS signs associated with respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, and old dogs with CNS signs alone. Thus, the clinical signs of CD vary depending on the age and immune status of the host as well as the virulence of the virus strain and the environmental conditions (Greene and Appel, 1990) . Acutely infected dogs shed the virus in all bodily secretions regardless of whether they are symptomatic or not. Although the virus cannot be isolated from the bodily secretions of dogs with subacute distemper encephalomyelitis and persistent viral infection of the CNS, they may still transmit the virus (Appel, 1987) .",

Such an assay would also help to exclude other diagnoses and prevent the further transmission of the disease. At present, CD can be diagnosed by virus isolation, immunofluorescence assays (IFA), RT-PCR, and realtime PCR (Frisk et al., 1999; Hoyland et al., 2003; Jozwik and Frymus, 2005; Shin et al., 2004) , all of which are relatively time-consuming and laborious techniques. The ImmunoComb antibody test kit (Biogal Galed Labs, Israel) for CD is also used frequently in animal hospitals to decide when to vaccinate a pet, as it reveals the anti-CDV IgM and IgG antibody levels. However, to use this test to determine whether a dog is infected with CDV, the animal has to be tested twice over several days. This delay in diagnosis is a serious limitation of this test.",

Of the remaining dogs, 16 provided blood and either nasal irrigation fluids or conjunctival swab samples, and 12 provided only blood. The conjunctival swabs and nasal irrigation fluids were each mixed with 1 ml PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) while blood lymphocytes were separated by using a LeucoSep TM tube (Greiner, Cat.

The dogs suspected to have CD were Maltese dogs (n = 20), Yorkshire Terriers (n = 13), Shih Tzu (n = 13), Korea Jindo dogs (n = 6), Poodles (n = 5), American Cocker Spaniels (n = 4), Pugs (n = 3), and Miniature Schnauzers (n = 2). Most were young dogs who demonstrated mainly acute and systemic clinical signs. However, six dogs which were over 2 years of age showed nervous symptoms. The Choongang Vaccine Laboratory (Daedeok valley, Daejeon, Korea) kindly provided us with the Rockborn strain of CDV, canine coronavirus (CCV), canine parainfluenza viurs type 2 (CPIV-2) and rabies virus.",

However, the direct IFA gives false negative results in the subacute or chronic form of the disease (Jozwik and Frymus, 2005) , and the other methods tend to be labor-and time-consuming. The Biogal's Immuno-Comb antibody test kit, which measures the anti-CDV IgM or IgG levels in the dog and is usually used to determine when to vaccinate, can be used as a subsidiary measure to deduce CD infection. However, with this method, the same dog has to be retested after several days to determine whether the antibody levels are increasing, which reflects an ongoing immune response and probable infection with CDV. This delay in diagnosis is a serious limitation of this method.",

In contrast, hospitalized dogs with neurological disturbances but lacking the typical findings of distemper were tested, RT-PCR analysis failed to detect CDV RNA in any of the serum samples while only 1/5 (20%) whole blood and 2/5 (40%) CSF samples were positive. However, 4/5 (80%) urine and all 5 (100%) CSF samples were positive (Amude et al., 2006) . Another study used RT-PCR to compare the various bodily secretions for the early detection of CDV in experimentally infected dogs . The conjunctival swab was found to be the most suitable specimen for early diagnosis of CD, as CDV amplicons were detected in the conjunctival swabs from all seven dogs at days 3-14 post-infection .",

These pocks were found by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequence analysis to contain CDV genes. Thus, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the IC assay were 9.2% and 2.2% lower than those of the nested PCR, respectively. It is possible that vaccination may lead to a false positive if testing occurs within a few days after vaccination. Indeed, one of the false positives results identified by the IC assay (which was then found to be a true negative) was a Korea Jindo dog that had been tested 4 days postvaccination. Notably, of the other dogs that were tested shortly after vaccination (two Yorkshire Terriers and one Shih Tzu were tested 3, 5, and 3 days post-vaccination, respectively), all were true positives as determined by both the IC and nested RT-PCR assays.

An IC test for simultaneous detection of specific antibodies against Babesia caballi and Babesia equi in the horse has also been developed by using recombinant B. caballi 48 kDa rhoptry protein and recombinant truncated B. equi merozoite antigen 2 (Huang et al., 2006) . However, the IC assays can be limited in terms of the amount of antigen they can detect, as large amounts of viral antigen are required to produce a clearly visible band. As a result, the interpretation of results may be affected by the subjectivity of the test operator.
