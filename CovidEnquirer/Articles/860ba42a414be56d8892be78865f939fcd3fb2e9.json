            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are an important cause of the considerable morbidity and mortality found in COPD. COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD, and some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations leading to hospital admission and readmission. These frequent exacerbations may have considerable impact on quality of life and activities of daily living. Factors that increase the risk for COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation caused by common pollutants and bacterial and/or viral infections. These inflammatory responses cause mucus hypersecretion and, thereby, airway obstruction and associated exacerbations. While chronic mucus hypersecretion is a significant risk factor for frequent and severe exacerbations, patients with chronic mucus hypersecretion have a lower rate of relapse after initial treatment for acute exacerbation. The benefit of antibiotics for treatment of COPD exacerbations is small but significant. While the mechanisms of actions are not clear, mucolytic agents reduce the number of days of disability in subjects with exacerbations. Reducing mucous cell numbers in small airways could be a useful way to reduce chronic mucus hypersecretion. Our studies suggest that programmed cell death is crucial in the resolution of metaplastic mucous cells, and understanding these mechanisms may provide novel therapies to reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations.",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic condition whereby airflow is limited. This limitation can be caused by a combination of underlying conditions, most notably chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic mucus hypersecretion (CMH) is a hallmark of chronic bronchitis. CMH is a common cause of morbidity and mortality, with an annual prevalence of diagnosed chronic bronchitis of 8.8 million in the United States [1] . In emphysema, alveolar destruction is associated with a loss of elastic recoil of the lung. Cigarette smoking is the major etiologic factor. The predominance of each condition varies among individuals. COPD causes significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences to individuals. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death and, of the five major diagnoses, only COPD is projected to have an increase in annual deaths by 2020 [2] . Once COPD has developed, there is no known cure for it. Despite the fact that COPD is often underdiagnosed, over 16 million people in the United States are estimated to have COPD, resulting in over 500 000 hospitalizations and 16 million office visits annually. COPD costs $24 billion annually [3] , with 70% of medical expenditures occurring for hospitalization due to acute exacerbations [4] .",

Of all COPD patients hospitalized, over 25% are admitted for acute exacerbations [4] , and 25% of these are readmitted [5] , often due to incomplete recovery [6] . About 30% of patients will have a recurrence within 6 months, and about 50% of these are readmitted within a year. The percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) is used to measure the severity of COPD and is associated with increasing occurrence of exacerbations as well as mortality. For example, Mannino et al. [3] found that patients with an FEV 1 of !40% have 2.3 exacerbations annually. Miravitlles et al. reported that those with less severe disease (FEV 1 O60%) have an average of 1.6 exacerbations annually [7] .

According to a commonly used definition, therefore, exacerbations are changes for 2 consecutive days in three ''major'' signs and symptoms (dyspnea, volume of sputum, and sputum purulence). Severity is determined by the presence of major or minor symptoms. ''Minor'' symptoms are increased cough or wheezing, upper respiratory infection (URI) (sore throat, nasal discharge) in the past 5 days, fever, and increased respiratory rate or heart rate 20% above baseline [15] . Severe exacerbation has been defined as an increase in all three major symptoms, moderate exacerbation as an increase in two major symptoms, and mild exacerbation as one major and one minor symptom. The importance of patient reports of symptoms in diagnosing exacerbations is underscored by the fact that objective measures (peak flow readings and spirometry) are not successful at detecting exacerbations early [9] . Early detection is key to early intervention and prevention of hospitalization. A greater understanding of the pathology of exacerbations most certainly should lead to better means of treating as well as preventing exacerbations.",

Relapse was defined as an unscheduled visit to the general practitioner before 1 month because of a persistence of or an increase in symptoms, which led to a change in drug prescription, an emergency visit, or a hospital admission. Treatment administered for acute exacerbations included antibiotics in 98% of cases and oral corticosteroids in 25% of cases. Only 38% of cases had mucolytic agents as treatment. Approximately 21% of individuals with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis suffered a relapse of exacerbation following treatment.",

            "text": "Most bacterial species that infect the bronchial tree also form part of the commensal of the nasal pharynx (e.g., H. influenza) or are opportunistic pathogens (e.g., P. aeruginosa). Mucosal infections are usually superficial and the majority of bacteria reside in the lumen, associated with secretions, whereas a proportion adhere in the epithelial surface, particularly in areas of epithelial damage, and some will infiltrate the mucosa [41] . Repeated injury from high-dose inhalation of atmospheric pollutants such as tobacco smoke or ozone leads to a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate in the mucosa by lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. Neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, eosinophils are attracted into the airway lumen, and their products may further impair the host defenses. Neutrophils release proteases such as neutrophil elastase and reactive oxygen species that damage epithelial cells and stimulate mucus production. Epithelial cells are also active participants in the inflammatory reactions because they release pro-inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide. This inflammatory response causes mucus hypersecretion, a change in the morphology of the airway involving a loss of ciliated cells, and an increase in the number of goblet cells in mucosal gland hypertrophy. The bronchitic airway is therefore vulnerable to infection, but there is also a well-primed immune system present that is ready to mount an inflammatory response to any further insult. Bacteria avoid clearance by producing factors that impair mucociliary clearance by paralyzing ciliary beat and stimulating mucus production; producing enzymes that break down local immunoglobulin; displaying antigenic heterogeneity to avoid immune surveillance; growing in biofilms; adhering to epithelium; surviving within epithelial cells; and forming microcolonies surrounded by polysaccharide gel [41] .",

            "text": "A report by Poole and Black [42] summarized the therapeutic potential of mucolytic agents in preventing exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD. In 21 studies, patients were defined as having chronic bronchitis that was most often defined as the presence of cough productive of sputum on most days for a minimum of 3 days per year for at least 2 consecutive years. In the remaining two studies, patients had COPD defined as a disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. It is likely that most of the patients with chronic bronchitis also had COPD, as most of these patients were smokers, and when lung function was measured, there was evidence of airway obstruction. In 12 of 23 studies, the mucolytic agent used were N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and mucolytic agents used were ambroxol, carbocysteine, sorbrerol, letosteine, cithiolone, iodinated glycerol, N-isobutyrylcysteine, and myrtol. Ten of the studies were conducted in Italy, three each in Scandinavia and Germany, four in the United Kingdom, two in several European countries, and one in the United States. All 23 studies had similar scoring standards. This review found the annualized exacerbation rate of 2.7 per year in the control group being reduced by 29% with treatment of patients with mucolytic agents. A similar study showed a reduction by 25%. Another study [43] found that 25% of patients who received mucolytic agents were twice as likely not to have an exacerbation during the study period than if they had received placebo. Treatment with mucolytic agents resulted in 0.56 fewer days of disability per patient per month. This finding was based on six studies and was supported by the results of four other studies where mean days of disability but not standard deviation values were reported. In two systematic reviews of the effects of NAC in patients with chronic bronchitis, it was shown that patients treated with NAC were more likely to remain exacerbation free. These patients were more likely to report an improvement in symptoms with NAC than with placebo.",

Potential mechanisms of actions include thinning of produced sputum, resulting in promotion of expectoration, and antioxidant and antibiotic activity. It has also been postulated that mucolytic agents may work via an antioxidant mechanism, which is generally accepted to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. In acute exacerbations of COPD, this oxidant/antioxidant imbalance is very profound and further studies will be needed to determine whether mucolytic agents acutely reduce the morbidity of these events. A third possibility is that mucolytic agents may work through antibacterial or immunostimulatory mechanisms because pretreatment with NAC resulted in significantly fewer patients having positive cultures from intrabronchial samples [44] . In addition, NAC has been shown to reduce the adhesion of S. pneumonia to oropharyngeal epithelial cells [45] .",

In addition, the airways are narrowed as a result of inflammation and scarring and, more importantly, due to the blocking of the lumen with mucous secretions [57] . Exacerbations can occur because a number of mucus-secreting cells in small airways are present that secrete their contents as a result of increased inflammation caused by exposures to new bacterial [21] or viral infections [58] , environmental pollutants such as ozone or other particles, or allergens. It is widely believed that these factors cause COPD exacerbations, and they are believed to do so largely by increasing inflammation. Increased inflammation may be primarily causing increased secretion of mucus from metaplastic goblet cells, which will immediately obstruct small airways and reduce or completely block airflow.",

Bcl-2, an inhibitor of apoptosis, belongs to a member of a family of proteins with anti-and pro-apoptotic properties that when overexpressed prevent or induce apoptosis, respectively. Pro-and antiapoptotic family members can heterodimerize, and their relative concentration determines whether a cell lives or dies [61] . These proteins function by regulating the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, initiating a cascade of events leading to activation of caspases and DNases that are responsible for the appearance of apoptotic morphology including DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, and disassembly of the cell [62] . Bcl-2 enhances cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis induced under a wide variety of circumstances. Bcl-2 extends cell survival by preventing cell death in different cell types and in response to different stimuli; this suggests that Bcl-2 acts at a central control point in the pathway to apoptotic cell death [63] . Bcl-2 expression is regulated by cytokines and other death-survival signals transcriptionally or posttranscriptionally by phosphorylation [60] .",

In these cells, approximately 10% are Bcl-2 positive, and this percentage does not change significantly following exposure to ozone. However, exposure to ozone induces GCM in transitional epithelia lining the lateral wall, and the nasal and maxillary turbinates, and the percentage of Bcl-2 positivity in these metaplastic mucous cells exceeds 50% [59] . These results show that Bcl-2 is low in endogenous mucous cells but is expressed in a high percentage of metaplastic mucous cells in nasal epithelia. This observation suggests that Bcl-2 could be a useful target for eliminating metaplastic mucous cells without affecting endogenous mucous cells. Another group of researchers used microarray approaches to identify Bcl-2 as one of the genes expressed following a smoke-induced injury to a human bronchial epithelial cell line, HBE1. They confirmed their observation by Northern blot assays [65] . Collectively, these studies show that Bcl-2 expression in mucous cells is found in animals and humans. Fig. 1 . Injury of the airway epithelium by LPS causes airway epithelial hyperplasia and mucous cell metaplasia. Proliferating (denoted by the black nuclei) and pre-existing cells can produce and store mucus (denoted by the vesicles in the columnar cells). Bcl-2-expressing cells are shown as mucous cells with black staining around the vesicles. Following 12-16 days, the epithelial cell numbers are reduced to essentially the numbers observed before injury to the epithelium.",

While the inflammatory response may subside, the genetic makeup of the epithelium leads to the inability of the epithelium to heal itself, causing GCM to persist. The following observations support this hypothesis: (1) Bcl-2 transgenic mice do not show resolution of LPS-induced GCM at 8 days after LPS exposure, while their wild-type littermates do [55] and (2) Horses with recurrent airway obstruction, also called COPD, have increased airway secretions of mucus that obstructs airflow [66] and have a significantly higher percentage of Bcl-2-positive mucous cells compared with control horses (personal observation).",
