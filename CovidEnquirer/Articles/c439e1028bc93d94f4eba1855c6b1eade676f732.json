Its mortality rate is marginally improved with the best supportive care. The demise occurs due to progressive pulmonary hypoxia and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with severe inflammation. Complement activation is a part of immune response against pathogen or insult in which membrane attack complex (MAC) is formed and eliminates microbes. If complement regulatory protein such as endothelial CD59 is underexpressed, MAC may also cause pulmonary vascular injury to the innocent bystander endothelial cell of host and provokes endotheliopathy that causes inflammation and pulmonary vascular microthrombosis, leading to ARDS.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by severe pulmonary vascular dysfunction characterized by acute onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia associated with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and systemic inflammation. Although the exact pathophysiologic mechanism causing pulmonary vascular dysfunction has not been determined yet, it is a circulatory dysfunction often associated with moderate thrombocytopenia [1] [2] [3] and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). [4] [5] [6] Because its pathogenetic mechanism is not clearly recognized, no effective therapeutic agent targeting the underlying pathologic disease has been procured to date. Ventilator support, fluid and electrolyte balances, and cardiopulmonary monitoring with the best supportive care have marginally improved the outcome of ARDS in several decades. Mortality rate is still very high. It increases with disease severity. In a multicenter, international, prospective cohort study of 3022 patients with ARDS, unadjusted hospital mortality was reported to be 35% among those with mild ARDS, 40% for those with moderate disease, and 46% for patients with severe ARDS. 7 Recently, two proposed hemostatic mechanisms have opened the door in the understanding of ARDS from molecular pathogenesis associated with endotheliopathy that promotes inflammation and coagulation disorder in sepsis and other critical illnesses [8] [9] [10] [11] ; one is \"two-activation theory of the endothelium\" in which endothelial pathogenesis activates inflammatory pathway and microthrombotic pathway and the other is a novel \"two-path unifying theory\" of hemostasis in which hemostasis initiates thrombogenesis and promotes microthrombogenesis, leading to vascular microthrombotic disease (VMTD). 8, 10, 12, 13 These two theories are congruous each other since the endothelium contributes to initial hemostasis and triggers molecular mechanism for thrombogenesis. In endotheliopathy, the pathologic nature of inflammation promoting inflammatory response 12 is recognized and the character of \"microthrombi\" leading to multiple hematologic phenotypes is identified. 9 In addition, the true mechanism of in vivo hemostasis in vascular injury and three different thrombogenetic mechanisms within hemostasis are uncovered. 8, 10 Through the recognition of endothelial molecular pathogenesis, enough evidences have been accumulated that ARDS is one of the phenotypes of MODS occurring as a result of disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT), which is the underlying pathology contributing to endotheliopathy-associated VMTD (EA-VMTD). 1, [9] [10] [11] The objective of this article is to analyze the clinical, pathological, and hematopathological features of ARDS and to account for involved pathophysiological mechanisms associated with endothelial dysfunction based on two hemostatic theories. In the end, this author will look into potential therapeutic option for the treatment of ARDS according to \"theorybased medicine\" instead of \"evidence-based medicine\" since clinical trials for ARDS have completely failed to find an effective therapeutic regimen.",

ARDS also occurs in association with trauma to the chest/lungs and head/brain, 14, 15 complications of surgery, pregnancy and transplant, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] certain drug, toxin, chemicals and venom exposure, 21 and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome. 9, [22] [23] [24] In addition, it also has developed in association with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). [25] [26] [27] Some clinicians have interpreted DIC was the cause of ARDS, but others proposed it was the result of complication of ARDS. Regardless, enough evidences have been presented that ARDS is a clinical disorder of pathologic hemostasis associated with activated coagulation system such as DIC. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] However, this author has placed quotation marks on \"DIC\" because recent reinterpretation has identified the current concept of \"DIC\" was ill-founded because it was based on the hemostatic mechanism of activated tissue factor (TF) path, 1, 8, 9, 11, 12, 28 which will be discussed briefly later in this article. Nonetheless, ARDS is one of the major organ phenotypic disorders among MODS contributing to the death associated with microthrombosis in critically ill patients due to diseases such as sepsis, trauma, and immune disorders.",

            "text": "As shown in Table 1 , although ARDS often occurs in association with a variety of sepsis, it can be preceded by pneumonia as seen in severe respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) due to SARS-CoV 29 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) due to MERS-CoV 30 as well as bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pneumonia, especially pneumococcal in particular. The clinical feature of developing pneumonia before sepsis suggests organotropism plays an important role in certain pathogen as shown by SARS virus possessing specific affinity to the lungs. 29, 30 Sometimes ARDS occurs following blood transfusion, which is called transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) that is characterized by acute noncardiogenic circulatory disorder of the lungs following blood product transfusions. 31, 32 Sepsisassociated ARDS, notwithstanding the absence of pneumonia, not uncommonly develops with other organ dysfunction such as encephalopathy, 33 hepatic failure, 34 acute renal failure, 35 and acute necrotizing pancreatitis. 36, 37 This multi-organ involvement suggests ARDS may not be primary disease but is likely a part of ongoing systemic pathogenetic mechanism due to infection or other critical illnesses as illustrated in Table 2 . 5, 12 Now, the underlying physiologic alteration of MODS in sepsis and other critical illnesses is identified as circulatory dysfunction occurring as a result of EA-VMTD. [11] [12] [13] This is an extremely important concept in the understanding for the pathogenesis of MODS as well as ARDS because we now know that the culprit of MODS is DIT, 1, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] which pathogenesis based on \"two-activation theory of the endothelium\" as shown in Figure 1 . 12, 13 Clinical and pathological features. The clinical features of ARDS are characterized by (1) acute onset of noncardiogenic respiratory distress, (2) bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and (3) evidence of diffuse circulatory obstruction of pulmonary vasculature. In addition to acute respiratory distress, hematologic features of ARDS include thrombocytopenia, 2,3,38-40 MODS, 1,4-6,9-12 DIT, 1, 3, 9, 11 \"DIC,\" 25, 26, [41] [42] [43] and TTP-like syndrome, [22] [23] [24] as presented in Tables 1 and 2 . These manifestations seemed to be consistent with a hemostatic disorder, which is now recognized as EA-VMTD. 9,10,12 Until recently, it was debated whether ARDS was the cause of thrombocytopenia, inflammation, MODS, and \"DIC,\" or was rather the result of another pathological condition producing those hematologic phenotypes. In later discussion, this dilemma will be further explored once the pathophysiological mechanism of ARDS is established.",

This pathologic feature appears to be similar to that of VMTD associated with TTP and TTP-like syndrome, which microthrombi are characterized by hyaline thrombi composed of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) and platelets. 48 Even though ARDS develops in association with divergent etiologies from sepsis to envenomation, 49 its pathologic and clinical features are remarkably similar among different underlying diseases. [50] [51] [52] Diffuse alveolar damage was the histologic changes in most patients with ARDS and its progression included 3 phases of exudative, proliferative, and fibrotic changes that correlated with the time rather than its specific causes. 52 These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that pathogenesis of ARDS is not due to multifactorial processes primarily involving the lungs, but is the result of one pathophysiologic mechanism affecting the lungs and multiorgans.",

            "text": "Consumptive thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients. As in other critical illnesses, thrombocytopenia commonly occurs in ARDS during the course of the disease. 1-3 Even after the known causes of thrombocytopenia such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, transfusion and drug-related thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression, and other identifiable thrombocytopenia are excluded, the mechanism of undetermined thrombocytopenia cannot be clearly accounted for in most of the cases. Thus, this has been designated as thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients (TCIP). 1, 53, 54 Recently, in critical illnesses such as sepsis and trauma, thrombocytopenia is suspected to be associated with endotheliopathy that initiates microthrombogenesis and forms microthrombi. The platelet consumption occurs when ULVWF released from endotheliopathy recruit platelets to form platelet-ULVWF complexes, 1, 9, 12 which become microthrombi strings and platelets are consumed. This concept of TCIP is direct and unequivocal evidence that endotheliopathy promotes in vivo hemostasis. Thrombocytopenia in critically ill patient usually presents with mild to moderately decreased platelet count, and bleeding has not been a significant issue in the care of critically ill patients. According to hemostatic principles (Table 3) , blood vessel damage limited to ECs in endotheliopathy Figure 1 . Endothelial molecular pathogenesis of ARDS and MODS in critically ill patients. Based on \"two-activation theory of the endothelium. Reproduced and modified from Chang. 12 Endothelial molecular pathogenesis of ARDS as one organ phenotype among various MODS is succinctly illustrated. The underlying pathologic nature of ARDS is a hemostatic disease due to endotheliopathy that promotes activation of two molecular pathways. One is inflammatory pathway, which releases cytokines and provokes inflammation, including fever, malaise, and myalgia. The other is microthrombotic pathway, which causes exocytosis of ULVWF and platelet activation and triggers much more deadly DIT via microthrombogenesis, leading to EAVMTD/DIT. Disseminated intravascular thrombosis orchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and TTP-like syndrome. ARDS indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome; DIT, disseminated intravascular thrombosis; EA-VMTD, endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease; ECs, endothelial cells; HC, hepatic coagulopathy; MAHA/aMAHA, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia/atypical microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; MODS: multi-organ dysfunction syndrome; MOF, multi-organ failure; TMA, thrombotic microangiopathy; SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome; TTP, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; ULVWF, unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers activates ULVWF path, but TF path is not activated if subendothelial tissue (SET)/extravascular tissue (EVT) illustrated in Figure 2 is not compromised. 8, 10, 12 As the hemostatic nature of microthrombosis associated with critical illnesses has not been recognized to date, TCIP has been benignly neglected although Bone et al 22 in late 70s had observed thrombocytopenia was a significant component when he described thrombocytopenia in ARDS. Now, TCIP is found to be consumptive thrombocytopenia caused by microthrombogenesis that leads to EA-VMTD/DIT. 9 More recently, the significant role of the platelet has been recognized in the care of patients with critical illnesses and ARDS. The degree of thrombocytopenia in sepsis was associated with increased severity and higher mortality 54,55 and thrombocytopenia was an increased risk and predictive for patient mortality in ARDS. 2 Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-like syndrome. When mild to moderate thrombocytopenia was present in ARDS, this author often found masked microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) in hematologic evaluation. 23, 24 Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia was less prominent in ARDS with fewer schistiocytes than that in acquired immune TTP, and also with mild to moderate anemia. If, however, the evidence of hemolysis were evident with reticulocytosis, hypohaptoglobinemia, increased lactic acid dehydrogenase, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia, 23, 24, 56 it was called atypical MAHA, which is more common in TTP-like syndrome (ie, EA-VMTD). In the literature, case reports described the association between ARDS and TTP-like syndrome. [22] [23] [24] [25] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] In this author's experience, ARDS with coexisting TTP-like syndrome responded dramatically when therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) was employed in very early stage of ARDS. 23, 24 The reasons why the diagnosis of TTP-like syndrome has been masked in ARDS were due to inconspicuous schistocytosis and unsuspected diagnosis as well as major attention for the patient care directed to respiratory distress in real-time clinical practice. More likely, it was also due to diametrically different pathogeneses between TTP and TTP-like syndrome, in which clear distinction has not been recognized until recently. 9 It was also caused by the fact that ARDS has never been considered to be a hemostatic disease, and further TTPlike syndrome was unknown to be caused by endotheliopathy. 9 Table 3 .

In clinical medicine, all patients with ARDS should be evaluated with a high index of suspicion to look for atypical MAHA as well as thrombocytopenia. Unexplained thrombocytopenia and firm evidence of hemolysis even with minimal or no schistocytes in repeated blood film examination may still be consistent with TTP-like syndrome. 13 Multi-organ dysfunction syndromes. In late 1980s, Vesconi et al 62 suspected that ARDS was caused by pulmonary vascular microthrombosis following very elegant investigation demonstrating pulmonary microvascular occlusive lesions in balloon occlusive pulmonary angiography in 31 patients with severe adult respiratory distress. In the study, multiple pulmonary artery filling defects were detected, which findings were interpreted to be consistent with vascular microthrombosis. However, the concept of microthrombosis was not defined yet in coagulation community. Nonetheless, the thesis of microvascular thrombosis or vascular microthrombosis can explain the compromised vascular circulatory function of the lungs and occlusive lesions in pulmonary angiography better than any of other propositions. Proposed theories for the pathogenesis of ARDS have included pulmonary vascular endothelial injury leading to endothelial dysfunction due to inflammatory cytokines or activated immune cells, 63 upregulation of adhesion molecules such as soluble vascular adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin, underexpression of vascular endothelial cadherins, 64, 65 interactions between neutrophils and cytokines promoting transendothelial migration of cytokine-primed neutrophils, 66 and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) provoking coagulation and microcirculatory failure. [67] [68] [69] However, these theories could not define how and what molecular changes occur to lead to ARDS and produce increased capillary permeability that was considered to be the hallmark of ARDS. 70 More importantly, these theories cannot answer why inflammation in ARDS is frequently associated with simultaneous hematologic syndromes and MODS. 5, 71, 72 The proposition of microthrombosis was a very important thesis because for the first time the potential hemostatic nature of ARDS was suggested. 62 Vascular microthrombosis or microvascular thrombosis has been well recognized as the underlying disease of TTP and more recently as that of TTPlike syndrome, which occurs in EA-VMTD as well as \"DIC.\" Although the molecular mechanism of ARDS has remained elusive, later Khadaroo and Marshall 5 correctly understood that vascular microthrombosis could contribute its clinical expression not only as ARDS in the lungs but also as MODS in other vital organs. In addition to common association of ARDS and MODS, the similar, if not the same, pulmonary pathologic changes from different pathogens and noninfectious critical illnesses support the mechanism that each of clinical Figure 2 . Schematic illustration of cross section of blood vessel histology and hemostatic components. The blood vessel wall is the site of hemostasis (coagulation) to produce hemostatic plug in vascular injury to stop hemorrhage from external vascular injury. It is also the site of hemostasis (thrombogenesis) to produce intravascular blood clots in intravascular injury to cause thrombosis. Its histologic components can be divided into the endothelium, tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa, and each component has different function contributing to molecular hemostasis. As shown in the illustration, endothelial injury triggers exocytosis of ULVWF from ECs, SET injury promotes the release of sTF from tunica intima, tunica media, or tunica externa, and EVT injury induces the release of eTF from the outside of blood vessel wall. These depths of blood vessel injury contribute to the genesis of different thrombotic disorders such as microthrombosis, macrothrombosis, and fibrin clot disease/hematoma. This concept is important in the understanding of endotheliopathy leading to ARDS, which leads to lone activation of ULVWF to produce microthrombi strings in ECs. ARDS indicates acute respiratory distress syndrome; ECs, endothelial cells; eTF, extravascular TF; EVT, extravascular tissue; RBC, red blood cell; SET, subendothelial tissue; sTF, subendothelial TF; TF, tissue factor; ULVWF, unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers.",

In this context, it can be concluded that ARDS, HUS, and every organ syndrome in MODS are also the manifestations of EA-VMTD/DIT, as illustrated in Figure 1 and further elaborated in Figure 3 . Indeed, ARDS is just one phenotype among MODS associated with increased microvascular permeability due to VMTD involving multiorgans. 5, 9, 12, 24, 34 This is also true for the current biorgan designation syndromes such as hepatorenal syndrome, cardiopulmonary syndrome, pulmonary-renal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, cardiorenal syndrome, and others. It should be emphasized that ARDS is not the cause of MODS, but all the organ phenotypes of MODS as well as ARDS are collateral syndromes provoked by VMTD. Next important question is how clinical expression of VMTD can be so variable in the development of MODS among every individual patient as shown in Figure 3 .

            "text": "Disseminated intravascular coagulation. \"Disseminated intravascular coagulation\" has occurred with ARDS with or without sepsis. 26, 27, [41] [42] [43] It has been considered be the most serious coagulopathy not only in sepsis but also in other human diseases, which is estimated to occur in about 30% to 50% of patients with sepsis. A 1996 study in Japan found that a diagnosis of DIC complicated about 1.0% of admissions to university hospitals. 74 According to NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, DIC is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body's small blood vessels. These blood clots can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels, which can damage the body's organs. 75 Generally clinicians and pathologists defined DIC as a widespread hypercoagulable state that can lead to both microvascular and macrovascular clotting and compromise blood flow, ultimately resulting in multiple organ dysfunction and MODS. 74 The truth is the coagulopathy of \"DIC\" couldn't be precisely defined because the concept of microthrombosis and its thrombogenesis had not been identified yet. It is because the physiological mechanism of in vivo hemostasis has been incompletely understood. For example, what is the role of von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the thrombogenesis and coagulation? Also, what is the role of the platelet in coagulation cascade? 76 What is the difference between fibrin clots of activated TF path and thrombosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)? What is the difference between microthrombi and macrothrombus? Why is microthrombosis disseminated, but is DVT localized? What is coagulation? and how is it different from thrombogenesis? All of these questions seem to be philosophical ones but are urgently needed practical questions in the patient care. There is no simple answer on the difference between DVT and DIC. The former responds to anticoagulation, but the latter does not. Why is it? Current dilemma is that \"DIC\" is found to be incorrect in its character and also in accepted contemporary pathogenetic mechanism according to this author's interpretation. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The reinterpretation of \"DIC\" based on \"two-path unifying theory\" of hemostasis and the mechanism of thrombogenesis clearly support that it occurs as a result of activated ULVWF path. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The credibility of \"DIC,\" which coagulopathy has been blamed to microthrombi composed of platelet-ULVWF complexes via microthrombogenesis by some and to fibrin clots made of fibrin, platelet, and coagulation factors through uncontrolled activation of TF-initiated path by others, is seriously undermined because of the irreconcilable conflict between microthrombi and fibrin clots. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] In in vivo hemostatic process, microthrombi and fibrin clots can be easily differentiated as illustrated in Figure 4A and B. The true character of blood clots in \"DIC\" is the same microthrombi occurring in VMTD as seen in TTP and TTP-like syndrome. 9 Also, the pathophysiological mechanism of \"DIC\" is not TF/FVIIa complex-activated coagulation cascade but instead is partial hemostasis due to lone activation of ULVWF path. 8 Since \"DIC\" (ie, microthrombosis) occurs as the result of endotheliopathy alone without the damage of SET/EVT, 8,10,12 TF path is not activated. This author has derived two theories of \"two-activation theory of the endothelium\" and \"two-path unifying theory\" of hemostasis from the analysis and interpretation of pathological, clinical, laboratory, and molecular characteristics between \"DIC\" and \"TTP-like syndrome\" and elaborated these hypotheses in previous publications. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Therefore, I shall not repeat them again. In short, it can be affirmed that \"DIC\" is exactly the same to EA-VMTD/DIT, which hematologic phenotype is TTP-like syndrome. 9 In summing up, the concept of \"DIC\" has been built on the following faulty pathophysiologic mechanism of hemostasis. Comments are followed after each statement. \"DIC\" is uncontrolled \"TF path\" initiated coagulation disorder occurring in sepsis and other critical illnesses. (Instead, it is \"ULVWF path\" initiated microthrombotic disorder.) \"DIC\" is triggered by inflammation, leading to pathologic \"fibrin clots\" through \"crosstalk\" between inflammation and coagulation. (Instead, it is triggered by microthrombogenesis, leading to pathologic \"microthrombi strings\" and \"no crosstalk\" is involved.) \"DIC\" is caused by microvascular thrombosis initiated by \"TF/FVIIa complex\". (Instead, it is caused by vascular microthrombosis initiated by \"platelet-ULVWF complex.\") \"DIC\" \"consumes coagulation factors and platelets in clotting process.\" (Instead, it is the result of \"released ULVWF from injured ECs that consume platelets in formation of microthrombi strings.\") Acute \"DIC\" is characterized by thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and severe hemorrhagic syndrome Figure 4 . A, Normal hemostasis based on \"two-path unifying theory.\" Reproduced and updated with permission from Chang. 12 In normal hemostasis, two different thrombotic paths, microthrombotic (ULVWF) and fibrinogenetic (TF), are involved in normal hemostasis, but later the 2 paths must unify to conclude normal hemostasis with passive role of NETs; it stops the bleeding in external bodily injury and produces the thrombosis in intravascular injury. However, in the different level (depth) of intravascular injury, thrombogenesis takes two different paths. If the level of intravascular injury is confined to the endothelium, lone ULVWF path becomes activated and causes microthrombosis (ie, EA-VMTD) because TF path is not activated.",

In another theoretical situation, if only SET/EVT is injured, available TF is supposed to activate lone TF path. However, in pathologic hemostasis, aberrant TF activation occurs and produces fibrin clots (ie, true DIC) in APL due to TF expression in intravascular space from leukemic promyelocytes.

B, Three paths in thrombogenesis based on \"two-path unifying theory.\" Reproduced and updated with permission from Chang. 10 Traditionally accepted hemostasis has been based on the concept of primary hemostasis in a local vascular injury followed by secondary hemostasis forming fibrin clots. However, this concept cannot explain microthrombi and thrombus formation. Therefore, novel \"two-path unifying theory\" of hemostasis was derived from the vascular physiologic logic of hemostasis based on 5 hemostatic principles and 5 essential components participating in hemostasis 8 and known works of many dedicated coagulation scientists. Please note that there are 3 different thrombogenetic paths in \"two-path unifying theory\" (macrothrombogenesis, microthrombogenesis, and fibrinogenesis) as annotated in bold face. Each thrombogenetic path occurs when ULVWF path, TF path, and/or combined paths are utilized depending upon the vascular levels of damage in intravascular injury, which include the endothelium, SET, and EVT. The characters of the thrombus/blood clot from different paths are unique and produce distinctly different clinical thrombotic disorders. The pathogenesis ARDS is via microthrombogenesis due to lone activation of ULVWF path, which promotes microthrombi strings made of platelet-ULVWF complexes in pulmonary vasculatures. APL indicates acute promyelocytic leukemia; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; DVT, deep vein thrombosis; EA-VMTD, endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease; EVT, extravascular tissue; SET, subendothelial tissue; TF, tissue factor; ULVWF, unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers. associated with \"consumption coagulopathy\" with depletion of FVIII and FV.

[84] [85] [86] However, its relationship between ARDS and complement activation has not been explored even though the role of C5b-9 was suspected to contribute to its pathogenesis 86 and C5a in highly pathogenic viral infections was also implicated in acute lung injury. 87 The activation of complement system is one of the key events in defense mechanism against sepsis. Its protective function for host rapidly identifies and eliminates invading pathogen. Opsonization of foreign surfaces by covalently attached C3b fulfills 3 major functions: cell clearance by phagocytosis, amplification of complement activation by the formation of a surface-bound C3 convertase, and assembly of C5 convertases. Cleavage of C5 induces the formation of a multiprotein pore complex C5b-9 (ie, membrane attack complex [MAC]), which leads to cell lysis. 88 Even though its major role is protective function for host through innate immune defense, complement activation could promote destructive action to innocent bystander of the endothelium of the host, leading to endotheliopathy and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETosis), 89 which may impact the course of sepsis and other critical illnesses. Membrane attack complex exerts deleterious effects to host's ECs 90 unless CD59 glycoprotein is adequately expressed in ECs and protects them by inhibiting C9 polymerization from MAC. 91, 92 If CD59 is downregulated due to either gene mutation or acquired disease, 93 perhaps activated complement could more readily exert destructive effect to the host's ECs causing endotheliopathy in critical illnesses. When MAC attacks the membrane of ECs, channel (transmembrane pores) formation develops on the endothelial membrane 90 and triggers endotheliopathy. [8] [9] [10] [11] Considering the role of the complement in ARDS as well as in sepsis, endothelial dysfunction via activation of complement cascade is suspected to be the major component contributing to pathologic hemostasis of ARDS.",

Endothelial dysfunction has long been known to be the key modulator in the pathogenesis of ARDS as well as sepsis and critical illnesses. 69, [94] [95] [96] [97] The markers such as various cytokines and coagulation participants indicating endothelial damage were significantly altered in patients with critical illnesses compared with controls, which included VWF, FVIII and endothelial procoagulants. 94 Recently, in view of the role of endotheliopathy and concept of VMTD based on novel in vivo \"two-path unifying theory\" of hemostasis, ARDS pathogenesis has been assured to be the result of pathologic hemostasis. [8] [9] [10] 12, 69, 96 In ARDS, heterogeneous expression of cell adhesion molecules by ECs was also noted in human pulmonary vasculatures. Although E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule were not expressed on ECs of normal lungs, immunochemical studies showed strong expression of both molecules on the larger vessels of the lungs supporting induction or upregulation in ARDS. 64, 98 Perhaps adhesion molecules could play a secondary role through endothelial heterogeneity and NETosis in the phenotypes of ARDS-associated MODS.",

It is about time we accept the microthrombosis of ARDS is the product of different hemostasis from macrothrombosis of DVT or PE. This distinction certainly support new concept of MODS, including encephalopathy, HUS, acute necrotizing pancreatitis, diffuse myocardial ischemia, fulminant hepatic failure from DVT and PE. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome is caused by microthrombosis the same as in ARDS as a result of microthrombogenesis. 9, 12 The term of microthrombogenesis is defined in previously mentioned two hemostatic theories. Both theories are congruent to each other, although the \"two-activation theory of the endothelium\" represents endothelial molecular pathogenesis following exocytosis of ULVWF in endotheliopathy ( Figure  1 ) and the \"two-path unifying theory\" elaborates in vivo hemostatic process following intravascular injury via the release of ULVWF ( Figure 4B ).

The former assembles microthrombi strings as seen in VMTD such as TTP, TTP-like syndrome, \"DIC\", HUS, ARDS, and the latter generates fibrin clots as seen in APL and certain envenomation. Then, next question is what is the character DVT and arterial thrombus seen in aortic aneurysm since they are neither microthrombi nor fibrin clots. Instead, they are obviously macrothrombus, containing fibrin clots and platelets. 111 Therefore, it has to be concluded that both ULVWF path and TF path must be involved in the formation of macrothrombosis such as DVT and arterial thrombosis. Through this elucidation, two-path unifying theory is borne out to explain not only \"two-path unifying theory\" of hemostasis but also three paths of thrombogenesis, which includes microthrombogenesis, fibrinogenesis, and macrothrombogenesis ( Figure 4A and B) . 8 Finally, in vivo hemostatic mechanism, including the additional role of NETosis at the unifying stage of activated ULVWF path and activated TF path, has been indirectly discovered. 12 The present hallmark of ARDS is vascular microthrombosis (ie, VMTD) as seen with sepsis. Sepsis is characterized by generalized endotheliopathy without compromise of SET/ EVT, which is also the same in ARDS. Hemostatic involvement in sepsis is lone activation of ULVWF path on ECs, leading to formation of microthrombi, but bleeding does not develop because SET and EVT damage do not occur and TF path is not activated. Unlike localized macrothrombosis (eg, thrombus of aortic aneurysm, acute ischemic stroke, and DVT), disseminated microthrombosis (ie, DIT) presents with many intriguing features such as ARDS and HUS as well as a variety of hematologic syndromes, including thrombocytopenia, MAHA, TTP-like syndrome, and \"DIC.\" [23] [24] [25] 57, 60, 61 According to \"two-path unifying theory\" of hemostasis, 8,10 two thrombotic/coagulation pathways, which are ULVWF and TF paths, are initiated in normal hemostasis but later the two paths must unify to conclude normal hemostasis with passive role of NETs. Hemostasis stops bleeding in external bodily injury but produce thrombosis in intravascular injury. In the different level (depth) of intravascular injury as presented in Tables 3 and 4 , different paths of thrombogenesis take place depending upon what component(s) of vascular wall is damaged ( Figure 2 ). If the intravascular damage is confined to the ECs (level 1), lone ULVWF path becomes activated and causes microthrombosis (ie, VMTD such as TIA, TTP-like syndrome, ARDS, and MODS) because TF path is not activated. On the other hand, if the intravascular damage extends from the ECs to SET (level 2), both ULVWF path and TF path become activated and cause macrothrombosis (eg, DVT; acute ischemic stroke) as illustrated in hemostatic theory ( Figure 4A and B). 10, 12 In addition, if the damage extends from the ECs to beyond vessel wall including SET and EVT (level 3), both ULVWF path and TF path become activated and form macrothrombosis with additional EVT bleeding (eg, thrombohemorrhagic stroke), which is summarized in Tables 3 and 4 . For example, for stroke, this concept is very important in the understanding of thrombogenesis, not only in making the diagnosis but also in planning for the treatment. Also, in another situation, if the ECs, SET-and EVT are damaged by obtuse external trauma, bleeding occur into EVT in smaller vessels, but without bleeding into the damaged vascular lumen. Tissue factor is released and mixed with blood in EVT to activate FVII to trigger the activation of TF/VII path. It causes only \"hematoma\" without significantly breached ECs because ULVWF path is not activated. This logic is based on \"twopath unifying theory.\" Please see Figure 4B , showing three different thrombogenetic processes: microthrombogenesis, fibrinogenesis, and macrothrombogenesis, which are annotated in bold/shaded face. Each thrombogenesis occurs when ULVWF path, TF path, or combined paths are activated depending upon the levels (depth) of damage in intravascular injury. The characters of microthrombi, fibrin clots, and macrothrombus from different paths are very different and produce distinctly different clinical thrombotic disorders. 10 Among these characters, ARDS is a hemostatic disease made of \"microthrombi strings.\"",

Nor is the comprehensible pathogenesis of microthrombosis orchestrating hematologic expressions, including thrombocytopenia, MAHA, MODS, and TTP-like syndrome. Since sepsis is the initiating cause of microthrombosis and ARDS is the manifestation of organ phenotype of microthrombosis, sepsis and ARDS often coexist.

[126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] However, medical community's task finding the answer on the pathogenesis of ARDS has been far from over. Now, the recognition of ARDS as an expression of hemostatic disease that is characterized by VMTD has widely opened the door not only in the understanding of this lifethreating phenotype organ syndrome but also in redefining other clinical MODS. Additionally, with the identification of different thrombogenetic mechanisms of microthrombosis, fibrin clot disease, and macrothrombosis, various thrombotic disorders could be more precisely defined through the submechanisms of in vivo hemostasis. 8, 10 Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most prominent organ phenotype syndromes developing in sepsis and other critical illnesses among MODS. Thus, once we understand ARDS as an organ phenotype syndrome of the lungs in VMTD, we should be able to understand the organ syndromes due to VMTD occurring in the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, muscles, adrenals, and others. It also affirms generalized EA-VMTD/DIT is the underlying disease, and ARDS and other organ syndromes are the manifestations of each specific organ phenotype in EA-VMTD/DIT. To make the matters simpler, the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic approach are the same in every phenotype of MODS. Finally, we should be able to treat all the patients with every organ phenotype syndrome, combined biorgan syndrome and MODS due to EA-VMTD/DIT with the same regimen focused on microthrombogenesis. Table 5 summarizes the identity of ARDS defined through clinical, etiologic, pathogenetic and phenotypic features of EA-VMTD. The pulmonary physiologic alteration of hypoxemia, increased capillary permeability and circulatory failure, pathologic changes of diffuse alveolar damage, exudative pulmonary edema, and hyaline membrane formation are the result of pulmonary vascular microthrombosis. Thus, the therapy for ARDS should directly target the pathogenesis producing VMTD.",

Unfortunately, all of the trials failed to significantly benefit the patient with ARDS.

Its underlying pathology is EA-VMTD/DIT and clinical phenotype is TTP-like syndrome. Generalized endotheliopathy activates the inflammatory pathway and microthrombotic pathway, triggering EA-DIT/VMTD. The former provokes inflammation, and the latter promotes consumptive thrombocytopenia, TTP-like syndrome, and hypoxic MODS. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is combined syndrome from two independently activated endothelial molecular pathogeneses. Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the pulmonary organ phenotype among various TTP-like syndromes. Acute respiratory distress syndrome responds to the TPE if initiated in very early stage of the disorder. Potentially effective targeted therapeutic strategy should be explored with antimicrothrombotic agents at the earliest possible time to save lives.",
