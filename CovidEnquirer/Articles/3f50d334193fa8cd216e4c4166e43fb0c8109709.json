            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), an emerging infectious disease caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has garnered worldwide attention as a consequence of its continuous spread and pandemic potential, making the development of effective vaccines a high priority. We previously demonstrated that residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing potent neutralization antibody responses. In this study, we sought to identify an adjuvant that optimally enhanced the immunogenicity of S377-588 protein fused with Fc of human IgG (S377-588-Fc). Specifically, we compared several commercially available adjuvants, including Freund's adjuvant, aluminum, Monophosphoryl lipid A, Montanide ISA51 and MF59 with regard to their capacity to enhance the immunogenicity of this subunit vaccine. In the absence of adjuvant, S377-588-Fc alone induced readily detectable neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses in immunized mice. However, incorporating an adjuvant improved its immunogenicity. Particularly, among the aforementioned adjuvants evaluated, MF59 is the most potent as judged by its superior ability to induce the highest titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes, and neutralizing antibodies. The addition of MF59 significantly augmented the immunogenicity of S377-588-Fc to induce strong IgG and neutralizing antibody responses as well as protection against MERS-CoV infection in mice, suggesting that MF59 is an optimal adjuvant for MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines.",

            "text": "A newly emerged infectious disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, 1 and has now been reported in at least 20 countries in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia and North America (http://www.cdc.gov/CORONAVIRUS/MERS/), raising worldwide concerns about its pandemic potential. By 26 December 2014, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the causative agent of MERS, had infected 941 people and caused at least 347 related deaths (mortality rate ,37%) (http://www.who.int/csr/don/ 26-december-2014-mers/en/). MERS-CoV utilizes bat and camels as natural reservoirs and intermediate transmission hosts, respectively. 2-6 MERS-CoV can spread through close contact or airborne transmission, causing serious public health problems. 7, 8 As such, the development of effective vaccination strategies to prevent MERS-CoV infection and disease is urgently needed. 9, 10 The MERS-CoV spike (S) protein plays important roles in virus attachment and subsequent entry into permissive cells expressing functional receptor (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4)). 11, 12 The receptor-binding domain (RBD), which resides within the S1 subunit of the S protein, mediates virus-receptor binding, thereby serving as an important target for vaccine development against MERS-CoV infection and disease. [13] [14] [15] Of the previously identified RBD-encoding residues which include residues 358-588, 367-588, 377-588 and 367-606, the fragment composed of 377-588 residues has been shown to contain critical neutralization epitopes. [13] [14] [15] [16] Specifically, we recently demonstrated that recombinant protein containing 377-588 residues fused with Fc of human IgG, designated S377-588-Fc, is particularly potent in eliciting neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice and rabbits. 15, 17 Additionally, incubation of permissive Vero E6 cells with this recombinant protein effectively prevented MERS-CoV infection. 15 Together, these results suggest that the S377-588-Fc protein is an ideal subunit vaccine candidate worthy of further development as a MERS vaccine.",

            "text": "Compared with other vaccine formats, such as inactivated virus, live-attenuated virus and viral vector-based subunit vaccines, recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines have the best safety profile, due to virtually non-existing concerns about possibly incomplete inactivation, regain of virulence of attenuated virus or unfavorable host responses to viral vectors. 18, 19 Additionally, effective recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines have the advantage of specifically targeting well-defined neutralizing epitopes. 19, 20 However, the relatively low immunogenicity of recombinant protein-based subunit vaccines, especially those formulated without adjuvants, compared to inactivated or live-attenuated viruses, represents a major hurdle in the development of safe and effective subunit vaccines. [20] [21] [22] While it is well accepted that adjuvants, in general, play essential roles in enhancing host immune responses especially to proteinbased subunit vaccines, different adjuvants could promote different host immune responses. For example, Freund's adjuvant, an oil emulsion, may induce strong immune responses, but is not suitable for human use because of its toxicity. 23 While aluminum salts (Alum) are licensed for human use as an adjuvant in the United States, they do not efficiently enhance the Th1-type of humoral and cellular immune responses that are important to combat viral pathogens. 24 Adjuvant System 04, a new generation Toll-like receptor (TLR)-based adjuvant which combines the TLR4 agonist MPL (3-O-desacyl-49-monophosphoryl lipid A) and Alum, is licensed for use in the human papillomavirus vaccine, Cervarix. 25, 26 AS03, which consists of Tocopherol, Squalene, and Polysorbate 80, is approved for use with human influenza A virus vaccines (http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Safety Availability/VaccineSafety/ucm376465.htm). 27 Monophosphoryl lipid A (mPLA), an adjuvant extracted from lipopolysaccharide, may enhance immune responses induced by influenza vaccines and is superior to Alum for cancer, HBV, malaria and HPV vaccines, but how to achieve the consistency of preparing mPLA-formulated vaccines remains a challenge. 23, 28 Montanide ISA51, an adjuvant approved for use in humans in Europe, has been shown to promote antigen-specific antibody responses with strong neutralizing activity against a variety of pathogens. 15, 29, 30 MF59, another adjuvant licensed for human use in Europe, has a well-established ability to promote immunogenicity of influenza virus vaccines with a safety profile in human populations comparable to that of Alum or Montanide ISA51/720. In addition, increased immunogenicity was seen in MF59-adjuvanted influenza A virus vaccine in elderly people compared to a conventional subunit vaccine. [31] [32] [33] In this study, we elucidated the effects of various adjuvants on the induction of host immune responses to a MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine using S377-588-Fc protein as a model antigen. Specifically, we compared MERS-CoV-specific humoral immune responses and neutralizing antibodies, as well as T cell-mediated immune responses elicited in mice immunized with differentially formulated vaccines. The results show that the use of MF59 as an adjuvant is most potent in optimizing MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccine responses.",

Subsequently, the ability of Freund's, Alum, mPLA-SM, ISA51 and MF59 to augment MERS-CoV RBD-induced IgG antibody responses was compared. To accomplish this, mice were immunized with S377-588-Fc in the presence or absence of the above adjuvants and sera were collected from day 0 and 10 days after each vaccination, according to the vaccination schedule shown in Figure 1 . As shown in Figure 2a , only a background immune response was observed in mice immunized with the first dose of S377-588-Fc in the absence of adjuvant, while a slightly elevated antibody response was induced by S377-588-Fc plus adjuvant. The level of response increased after the second immunization, reaching a higher level after the third immunization. While S377-588-Fc was immunogenic by itself, the addition of adjuvants improved its immunogenicity to varying extents as evidenced by specific antibody titers, depending on the type of adjuvant used. Among the adjuvants tested, MF59 appeared to be most potent in promoting specific IgG antibody responses, with titers reaching significantly higher levels than those induced by other adjuvants (P,0.05) after two immunizations. In the absence of any adjuvant, S377-588-Fc alone induced antibody responses after two or three immunizations, suggesting that the Fc fragment when fused with the RBD protein potentiated the immune response induced by the RBD-based vaccine. As expected, mock immunization with PBS did not result in any induction of detectable MERS-CoV-specific antibodies ( Figure 2a) .",

In the absence of an adjuvant, S377-588-Fc alone could induce readily detectable MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies with a slight bias towards Th2-type (IgG1) response ( Figure 3) . However, addition of any given adjuvants tested modulated IgG subtype responses. Specifically, we noted that unlike other adjuvants, including Freund's, Alum, mPLA-SM and ISA51, none of which promoted S377-588-Fc-induced IgG1 responses, the usage of MF59 as an adjuvant significantly enhanced both IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes of antibody (Figure 3a and b). Despite their failure to further promote IgG1 subtype responses, Freund's and ISA51 adjuvants, like MF59, could significantly increase the IgG2a (Th1) antibody response (Figure 3b ). Further analysis of Th1-versus-Th2 antibody responses revealed that mice immunized with MF59-adjuvanted S377-588-Fc, similar to those immunized with S377-588-Fc alone, exhibited specific IgG antibody responses which were slightly Th2 (IgG1) biased, whereas those immunized with Alum-and, particularly, mPLA-SM-adjuvanted S377-588-Fc protein more strongly elicited a Th2 (IgG1)-biased response (Figure 3c ). Taken together, among the adjuvants tested, MF59 seemed to be the most potent adjuvant in augmenting the specific antibody response elicited by the MERS-CoV RBD subunit vaccine, enabling the induction of strong and more generalized IgG subtype antibody responses.",

Specifically, a standard neutralization assay was performed in microtiter plates using DPP4-expressing Vero E6 cells. We found that immunization with S377-588-Fc protein alone was capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies to an extent similar to that of Freund's-adjuvanted S377-588-Fc, suggesting that addition of Freund's adjuvant to the vaccine formulation has little advantage on improving the neutralization antibody response in immunized mice ( Figure 5 ). In contrast, we noted that S377-588-Fc protein formulated with Alum, ISA51, mPLA-SM and especially MF59 significantly increased the titers of neutralization antibody. Among five adjuvants evaluated, MF59, mPLA-SM and Freund's appeared to represent the most, the second and the least potent ones, respectively, to promote the production of neutralizing antibodies in immunized Formulation of MERS-CoV S377-588-Fc protein with different adjuvants enhanced MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG antibody responses at varying extents elicited by immunized mice. Sera collected at different days after each immunization, as depicted in Figure 1 , were subjected to ELISA-based analysis for S1-specific IgG antibody responses. IgG antibody titers were evaluated by using serum specimens that were diluted 3200-fold. Sera collected from mice prior to immunization, i.e., day 0 and day 10 after each immunization were included in this evaluation for determining the kinetics of IgG antibody response (a). Additionally, sera collected from individual groups of mice at day 10 after the last immunization were also subjected to the ELISA-based binding (b) and specific IgG antibody assays (c), respectively. The titers are expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. The data are presented as mean6s.d. from five mice in each group. PBS was included as the control.

In our previous and current studies, we observed that the immune responses after the secondary or tertiary immunization were always much higher than those after the primary immunization (Figure 2a) , 30, [43] [44] [45] suggesting that the potential suppressive effect of pre-existing mouse antihuman Fc antibodies if present, is negligible. Similarly, the Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1), a protein-based adjuvant, is able to induce antiself antibodies in vaccinated mice. 46 Our previous study has shown that the pre-existing mouse anti-Ov-ASP-1 induced in the primary immunization has no significant impact on the adjuvanticity of Ov-ASP-1 in subsequent immunizations. 46 Another concern in using an Fc fragment to enhance immunogenicity is that the regulatory T-cell epitopes in IgG Fc may activate natural regulatory T cells, resulting in tolerance of immune responses. de Groot et al. 47 have demonstrated that both IL-4 and anti-HDM (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus) antibody titers in HLA DR4 transgenic mice were reduced when HDM antigen was co-administered with regulatory Tcell epitopes in murine IgG Fc. Although we have not observed such immunotolerance induced by the Fc fragment in S377-588-Fc protein during the 6-week immunization period, further investigation of the potential of the Fc fragment in the S377-588-Fc protein to induce immunotolerance in HLA DR4 transgenic mice is warranted.",

            "text": "Adjuvants promote immune responses mediated by proteinbased vaccines by stabilizing antigen conformation, targeting antigens to APCs, directing antigen presentation through major histocompatibility complex class I or II responses, stimulating Th1 or Th2 CD4 1 or CD8 1 T cells, and modulating antibody specificity and isotype against particular antigens. [48] [49] [50] To increase the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV RBD protein, we selected several commonly used adjuvants in the field of vaccinology, such as Freund's, Alum, mPLA-SM, ISA51 and MF59, to formulate a panel of recombinant S377-588-Fc protein vaccines. The potential mechanisms of action of these adjuvants are notably different. Alum, for example, mainly stimulates innate immunity by promoting antigen uptake and presentation and upregulating major histocompatibility complex class II molecules CD40 and CD86, or by inducing Th2 cells to mediate B-cell differentiation and to secrete IgG1 subtype and IgE antibody. 49, 50 mPLA, an agonist of TLR4, suppresses inflammatory immune responses by stimulating TLR4, and promoting monocytes to produce IL-10. mPLA functions through a bias toward the Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-b-signaling. 51, 52 MF59 adjuvant is reported to increase antigen uptake by APCs, to induce a local immunostimulatory environment by recruiting key immune cells, such as CD11b 1 and MHC class II 1 cells, to the injection site, and to enhance transport of antigen to lymph nodes. 53, 54 MF59 may also promote an early CD4 1 T-cell response, allowing for better recall responses and long-term persistency of protective antibody responses. 55, 56 In the present study, we immunized mice with S377-588-Fc protein that has been formulated individually with the aforementioned adjuvants, followed by comparison of the resulting MERS-CoV-specific total and neutralizing antibody and T cell-mediated responses. Indeed, we found that S377-588-Fc-induced immune responses could be further improved by incorporating some adjuvants, such as MF59. When formulated with MF59 adjuvant, S377-588-Fc induced high levels of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies with strong neutralizing activity ( Figure 3 and 5) , suggesting that both Th1 (IgG2a) and Th2 (IgG1) antibody responses may play roles in inhibiting MERS-CoV infection. However, we could not exclude the possibility that Th2 (IgG1) antibody may play a dominant role in neutralizing MERS-CoV infection. It was reported that IgG1 is the main subclass induced after West Nile virus infection of humans and IgG1 accounts for most of the in vitro neutralization capacity. 57 But we did not observe similar phenomenon in this study on MERS-CoV infection. For example, mPLA-SMadjuvanted RBD induced significantly lower IgG1 antibody than MF59-adjuvanted RBD (Figure 3a) , while the antibodies from both groups exhibited equally potent neutralizing activity ( Figure 5 ). Therefore, further study on this issue is warranted. Unlike other adjuvants tested, MF59 promoted rapid increases in IgG antibody after two immunizations with S377-588-Fc protein. Antibody levels did not significantly increase after further boosting (Figure 2 ), suggesting that two doses of immunization is sufficient when MF59 adjuvant is used.",

MF59 is superior to Alum and other adjuvants in inducing antibody responses against antigens of viruses such HIV, HBV, HCV, HSV-2 and influenza viruses. 66 It is an effective and safe vaccine adjuvant approved in Europe for use with influenza vaccines. 53, 67 Unlike Alum, MF59 vaccine adjuvant has been widely used in clinical trials of influenza vaccines, particularly after the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza, and demonstrated a high safety profile and strong immunogenicity in enhancing and broadening protection against influenza virus infections. 68, 69 Because of its strong efficacy in potentiating the immunogenicity of influenza virus antigen, MF59 allows for antigen dose sparing and is able to increase seroconversion and cross-protection after vaccination with only two doses. 70 Therefore, pandemic influenza vaccines with MF59 have been prioritized since antigen dose-sparing and enhancing cross-reactive antibody titers are critical in the event of a pandemic or epidemic. 71 Here we showed that although mPLA-SMadjuvanted MERS-CoV RBD protein also induced stronger neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection than most of the other adjuvants tested ( Figure 5 ), its efficacy was significantly lower than that of MF59 (Figures 2-4) .

IgG antibody titers were evaluated by using serum specimens that were diluted 3200-fold. Sera collected from mice prior to immunization, i.e., day 0 and day 10 after each immunization were included in this evaluation for determining the kinetics of IgG antibody response (a). Additionally, sera collected from individual groups of mice at day 10 after the last immunization were also subjected to the ELISA-based binding (b) and specific IgG antibody assays (c), respectively.
