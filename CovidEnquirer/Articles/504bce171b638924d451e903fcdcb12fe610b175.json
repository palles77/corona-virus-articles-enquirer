Cases have been identified since then in Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan etc [6] [7] . The host which is causing this deadly plague is still in suspense, but there is another reason which is setting researchers in a puzzled situation. Animals are set to be another major cause for the spread of this deadly disease. Intrinsically, a research team had observed the blood samples of 50 camels from Oman and compared to 15 of 105 samples from Spanish camels. Reusken et al. have performed this study in which they have confirmed that the all the Omani camels that were investigated (100%) did possess protein specific antibodies against MERS-CoV spike which confirms that the camels may lead the major role in spreading of this virus among Middle East countries [8] .",

A research team from their previous work did elucidate that a group 2 CoV was found in a bat Pipistrellus pipistrellus, in Europe. Four verspertilionid bat species were found to excrete group 1 CoVs, viz. Myotis daubentonii, Myotis dasycneme, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, and Nyctalus noctula [10] . They have also affirmed that the European Pipistrellus bat-derived CoVs that are closely related to MERS-CoV. Another study by Drexler et al. did confirm that novel clade 2c betacoronaviruses in Nycteris bats were phylogenetically related to the novel hCoV EMC/2012 [11] . Knowledge of the close relatedness of PML/2011 and MERS-CoV, which contrasts with the more distant relatedness of CoVs in bats from the Americas and Asia, enables speculations of an African origin for bat reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV ancestors. Corona viruses were very much amplified in bat maternity colonies in temperate climates [12] . Fecal samples were collected on tarps laid out at bat roosting sites in and around Bisha, Unaizah, and Riyadh also suggested that bats can probably transmit the virus. Technically, no CoV virus has not been directly isolated from any bats. However, there is a need for high research activities to be included in countries where there is high prevalence of this virus.",
