Here we used CHO-K1 cells to establish a cell line for stable expression of a 193-mer (residues 318-510) RBD (RBD193-CHO) and determined its antigenicity and immunogenicity. We found that RBD193-CHO reacted strongly with a panel of six monoclonal antibodies recognizing various conformational and linear epitopes in RBD, suggesting that this recombinant protein maintains intact conformation and good antigenicity. Immunization of mice with RBD193-CHO resulted in induction of high titers of RBD-specific neutralizing antibodies and potent IL-4-expressing T cell responses. RBD193-CHO induced immunity that protected a majority of the vaccinated mice from SARS-CoV challenge. These results suggest that the recombinant RBD produced in an established stable cell line maintains strong immunogenicity with high potential for use as an effective and economic subunit SARS vaccine.",

As shown in Fig. 3 , RBD193-CHO elicited both CTL and Th responses, represented by production of a relatively higher level of IL-4-secreting CD8+ and Th2 T cells than that of IFN-c-and IL-2-representing CTL and Th1 T cells under the stimulation of the CTL peptide N50 and Th peptide N60, respectively. In comparison, stronger T cell responses, which were represented by induction of a high level of IL-2-, IL-4-and IL-10-presenting T cells, could be observed in the vaccinated mouse splenocytes with the stimulation of the recombinant RBD protein. In addition, IFN-cexpressing T cells induced by RBD protein are also relatively higher than those stimulated by N50 or N60 peptide alone (Fig. 3) . However, an undetectable level of cellular immune responses was found in the splenocytes of PBS control mice. Overall, these data confirm the ability of RBD193-CHO protein to elicit cellular immune responses in the vaccinated mice.",

No SARS-CoV was detected in the mice vaccinated with RBD193-CHO protein, with undetectable viral RNA copies in challenged mouse lungs. In contrast, a high level of virus was found in the lung tissues of all five PBS control mice, with viral load ranging from 1.5 \u00c2 10 3 to 2.2 \u00c2 10 3 RNA copies/lg of lung tissues (Fig. 4A) . Consistently, no virus replication was detected in three out of the five vaccinated mice challenged with SARS-CoV, and only a low level of replicable virus (about 3 Log 10 TCID 50 /g of tissues, which is slightly above the detection limit of 1.5) was detected in the lungs of the remaining two mice (Fig. 4B) . These suggest that RBD193-CHO could induce strong immunity that protects a majority of the vaccinated mice against SARS-CoV challenge. But further evaluation of the in vivo efficacy of RBD193-CHO vaccine in a lethal mouse model [28, 29] is warrented.",

However, to obtain highly expressed RBD protein with biological functions in a convenient and economic way, we sought to establish a stable cell line for long-term and high volume production of the recombinant RBD. Therefore, CHO-K1 cells, rather than 293T cells, were selected because CHO-K1 cells have the ability to express the protein of interest persistently at a high level [22, 26, 27] . Based on this rationale, the plasmid for transient expression of a 193-amino acid (residues 318-510) RBD (RBD193-CHO) of SARS-CoV S protein in CHO-K1 cells was constructed first. The purified protein was characterized, and its function was confirmed. Then, a stable CHO-K1 cell line was successfully established, and it was demonstrated that this cell line could highly and persistently express RBD193-CHO protein in the culture supernatant of conditioned medium (Fig. 1A) . The purified protein was proven to exhibit good antigenicity since it significantly reacted with five of six mAbs that recognize the conformational epitopes in RBD and one mAb specific for the linear RBD epitope (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that RBD193-CHO protein maintains intact conformation. The analysis of the immunogenicity of RBD193-CHO protein in the mouse model indicated that the expressed protein induced potent RBD-specific antibody responses with neutralizing antibody activity (Fig. 2) and strong T cell immune responses (Fig. 3) .",
