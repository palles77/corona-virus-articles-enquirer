A Swedish isolate of PCV2 (S-PCV2) retrieved in 1993 from a healthy pig has been used in this model to reproduce PMWS in pigs from Northern Ireland. This virus has been present in the Swedish pig population for at least a decade without causing any known PMWS disease problems, despite its potential pathogenicity. The reasons for this are unknown, but could be related to genetics, absence of triggers for PCV2 upregulation (infectious agent and/or management forms) within Swedish pig husbandry. In order to confirm the pathogenicity of S-PCV2, Swedish and Danish pigs were experimentally infected with this isolate according to the established model. Swedish pigs were also infected with a reference isolate of PCV2 (PCV2-1010) to compare the severity of disease caused by the two isolates in Swedish pigs. Both Danish and Swedish pigs developed PMWS after the experimental infection with S-PCV2. Antibodies to PCV2 developed later and reached lower levels in serum from pigs infected with S-PCV2 than in pigs inoculated with PCV2-1010. In general, pigs infected with S-PCV2 showed more severe clinical signs of disease than pigs infected with PCV2-1010, but pigs from all PCV2inoculated groups displayed gross and histological lesions consistent with PMWS. All pigs inoculated with PPV, alone or in combination with PCV2, displayed interleukin-10 responses in serum while only pigs infected with PPV in combination with www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 106 (2005) 49-60 PCV2 showed interferon-a in serum on repeated occasions. Thus, the pathogenicity of S-PCV2 was confirmed and a role for cytokines in the etiology of PMWS was indicated. #",

            "text": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is now accepted as the causal agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). However, it is also recognised that other additional infectious (Allan et al., 1999; Allan et al., 2000a; Krakowka et al., 2000) or non-infectious factors (Rose et al., 2003) are necessary for the full clinical expression of the disease. PMWS was first observed in high health herds in Canada in 1991 Ellis et al., 1998) , and has since then rapidly become a major problem in many pig-producing countries throughout the world. Retrospective studies have demonstrated that a PCV2 virus has been present in pigs for many years prior to the recognition of PMWS without being associated with any specific disease syndrome (Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2003; Walker et al., 2000) . The global epizootic spread of PMWS since 1996 suggests that the PCV2 virus in pigs may have mutated to a more pathogenic form or that another agent in combination with PCV2 is necessary for the development of PMWS. Alternatively, it has also been suggested that the susceptibility of the host to PCV2associated clinical disease has, in some way, changed due to alterations in the pig industry. Efforts to identify new pathogenic genotypes of PCV2 (de Boisseson et al., 2004) or new common co-infecting microorganism have, to date, failed and epidemiological studies including numerous aspects of husbandry forms have not yet revealed any particular factor(s) that predispose for PMWS (Larochelle et al., 2003; Pogranichniy et al., 2002; Rose et al., 2003) .",

The present study thus confirms that a strain of PCV2 virus can persist in a pig population without causing clinical PMWS, and still be pathogenic under certain conditions. This potential of S-PCV2 has previously been demonstrated in the same experimental model using pigs derived from an SPF unit in Northern Ireland (Allan et al., 2003) , and the present study shows that Swedish pigs are susceptible to experimental reproduction of PMWS.

PMWS was diagnosed in Sweden in late 2003 and so far the spread of disease is moderate with only few animals showing clinical disease in affected farms. It is to date not possible to predict the final outcome of PCV2-related diseases in Sweden, but it seems that the prevalence and mortality within each herd is comparably low, approximately 7% mortality and runts after weaning. Thus, the situation is more similar to what has been reported from North America than that reported from the rest of Europe (Harding, 2004) . Generally, postweaning mortality in Sweden is low (2.5% of weaned pigs in 2003, http://www.qgenetics.com) and the country is free from many porcine pathogens such as PRRSV, ADV and enteric corona virus. Also, rearing of pigs according to the ''Swedish model'' includes a relatively high weaning age (4-5 weeks), batch-wise rearing from birth to slaughter, and a reduction of transportation and/or mixing of pigs from different litters. All of these factors may contribute to the relative resistance of the Swedish pig industry to PCV2-related diseases, although it is now clear that Swedish pigs can develop PWMS both experimentally and naturally. Notably, the first PMWS outbreaks in Sweden occurred in herds where high production intensity had resulted in deviations from this ''Swedish model''.",

No pigs in this group died from PMWS, and no animal showed clinical signs of disease related to PMWS during the experimental period. At necropsy, however, all pigs from this group displayed gross lesions consistent with PMWS. The combined manifestation of clinical disease and pathological lesions caused by the two isolates indicates that the pathogenicity of the Swedish isolate is equal to or even higher than that of PCV2-1010. In two previous studies applying the same experimental model, however, the proportions of pigs developing clinical PMWS was somewhat larger, both concerning PCV2-1010 and S-PCV2 (Allan et al., 2003; Allan et al., 1999; Allan et al., 2004) .

This was also evident from early deaths among pigs in all experimental groups, which in most cases were related to navel infections, and could be expected for pigs snatched-farrowed in a conventional farm. On later sampling occasions, however, IFN-a could only be detected in sera from pigs in groups 3 and 4 that had been inoculated with PCV2. In contrast, elevated serum IL-10 was indicated in pigs infected with PPValone or in combination with PCV2. This suggests that PPV induces a systemic response of this cytokine, which might be of importance for the development of PMWS in the experimental co-infection with PCV2. In natural cases of PMWS, an over-expression of IL-10 mRNA has been found in PBMC (Sipos et al., 2004) and thymocytes (Darwich et al., 2003b) , and PBMC from PMWS affected pigs preferentially produced IL-10 and IFN-g at in vitro re-exposure to PCV2 (Darwich et al., 2003a) . If an altered cytokine profile is caused by progressing PMWS or induced by other factors that might predispose for PMWS, remains however to be determined. Interestingly, PRRSV infections, often considered as a co-factor for development of PMWS, induced increased expression of IL-10 mRNA in PBMC, lung tissue and bronchoalveolar cells (Chung and Chae, 2003; Johnsen et al., 2002; Suradhat and Thanawongnuwech, 2003) . Thus, if IL-10 expression is important for PMWS development, the PRRSV free status of Sweden may well explain the lower incidence of PMWS recorded within Swedish herds.",

            "text": "The impact of PPV infections in the pathogenesis of PMWS was recently demonstrated under field conditions where PMWS was induced in segregated earlyweaned 6-7 week old pigs co-infected with PPV and PCV2 (Opriessnig et al., 2004) , which further justifies the current experimental model. It should, however, be noted that the permanent treatment with broadspectrum antibiotics severely affected the normal bacterial flora of the gut. Pen floor samples revealed less than 10 2 CFU coliforms per gram faeces (data not shown) compared to 10 8 -10 10 in samples from nontreated pigs of the same age category (Melin et al., 2000) . The importance of a normal microflora for the development of both mucosal and systemic immunity has been described for several species, including gnotobiotic piglets (Tlaskalova-Hogenova et al., 2004) . In addition to the antibiotic treatment, piglets were handfed with cow-milk based colostrum substitutes during the first days of life to avoid passive transfer of porcine immunoglobulins. This treatment might further affect the function of the gut associated lymphoid tissue of the experimental pigs. Since large amounts of PCV2 are secreted through faeces during PMWS, the gut and surrounding tissues are likely to be involved in the replication of PCV2 as well as of PPV. Thus, several non-physiological effects are caused by the present experimental model, which have to be considered for a better understanding of co-factors that contribute to the development of PMWS. Nevertheless, the results presented here clearly show that a virus strain that persisted for 10 years in a SPF-herd without causing clinical PMWS was able to induce this disease under experimental conditions in pigs of different origin. Further studies concerning the effects of husbandry forms as well as genetics of the animals and microorganisms are needed to elucidate why the spread of PMWS differs between regions.",
