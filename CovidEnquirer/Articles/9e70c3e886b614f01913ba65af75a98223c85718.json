Though free peptides can confer protection, it is generally found that their immunogenicity can be enhanced by presenting them on the surface of a macromolecular assembly [1] . Initial studies involved chemically crosslinking synthetic peptides to a variety of moderately sized carrier proteins [2] . Subsequently, attention has turned to genetically fusing polypeptide sequences to self-assembling macromolecules, qb use such a method, it is necessary that the fused sequence does not interfere with the assembly process and that it is exposed on the assembled particle. Suitable sites have been identified either empirically or on the basis of a known three-dimensional (3D) structure. In this review; we examine the use of self-assembling systems as a method of presenting epitopes and the future prospects for such systems.",

There are approximately 2700 copies of the 50 amino acid long pVIII protein per virion, which form a helical structure around the genomic single-stranded DNA, and about five copies of each of the minor constituents [6] . To investigate the potential of filamentous phage as an epitope presentation system, de la Cruz et aL [7] inserted tetrapeptide repeats from the circumsporozoite protein of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum between the functional domains of the minor capsid protein pill of phage fl. The recombinant phage were immunogenic in rabbits but gave variable responses in mice. To increase the number of copies of the insert on the modified phage, antigenic sequences were inserted near the N terminus of the major capsid protein, pVIII, of fd [8] and M13 [9] . However, it has proved impossible to recover assembled particles when the modified pVIII protein contains inserts longer than about six amino acids. This limit to the size of the insertion may reflect, constraints imposed during the initiation of assembly [10] . The insertion of a five amino acid sequence near the N terminus of pVIII does not appear to alter the architecture of the phage particles [9] and fibre diffraction studies [11 \u00b0\u00b0] indicate that such inserts are presented in an extended conformation between two ix helices on the surface of the virions, qb express longer sequences fused to pVIII, hybrid fd phage containing a mixture of modified and wild-type pVIII have been constructed. The resulting particles contained 10-30% of the modified protein. Such hybrids partic!es expressing cpitopes from Plasmodiumfa/ciparum [8, 12] or the V3 loop of tlIV-1 [131 have been shown to elicit an appropriate immune response when injected into experimental animals.",

For example, the coat protein of the small spherical RNA-containing bacteriophage MS2 has been modified to express epitopes up to 24 amino acids long [14] . Particles of MS2 contain 180 copies of a single coat protein arranged in a T =3 lattice (Fig. la) and the foreign sequences were inserted in the N-terminal 13 hairpin [15] . When expressed in Escherichia co~i, the modified coat proteins can self assemble into empty virus-like particles which are immunogenic. In view of the fact that the structures of a number of MS2 mutants have been solved recently [16], this system may provide a means of determining the 3D structure of inserted sequences. Two systems involving bacteriophage X have also been developed for displaying foreign protein sequences. These involve making fusions either to the C terminus of V tail protein [17] or to the N terminus of the D capsid protein [18\"]. In the former case, only a fraction of the V proteins are modified and the system allows the expression of proteins as large as tetrameric 13-galactosidase; in the latter case, all copies of the D protein could be modified to express peptides of significant length.",

Particles of a more homogeneous size (ll-16nm) can be produced when a truncated form of TYA containing amino acids 1-381 is expressed in yeast [19, 20] . It has proved possible to fuse substantial lengths of heterologous sequences (>20 kDa) after amino acid 381 without abolishing the ability of the particles to assemble; particles expressing portions of HIV-1 proteins at this site were weakly immunogenic [20] . Immunological analysis of the 1-381 particles indicates that although the N terminus of the TYA protein is on the exterior of the assembled particles, the C terminus lies on the interior [21]. This probably explains the relatively poor immunogenicity of sequences fused to the C terminus. Analysis of regions of the TYA proteins essential for particle formation indicates that there are many non-essential sequences, including the N-terminal 40 amino acids [22\" ]. This information should greatly assist the development of new TYA-based systems.",

            "text": "Two self-assembling proteins from hepatitis B virus have been developed as epitope-presentation systems. The first to be developed was based on the 22nm particles formed by the surface antigen (HBsAg). These particles contain lipids and approximately 100 molecules of 226 amino acid long S protein. Expression of this protein in a variety of systems leads to production of lipoprotein particles similar to those found during infection. Initial The self-assembly properties of the coat proteins of two plant viruses have been used to design potential antigen-presentation systems. In the first instance, an eight amino acid epitope from VP1 of poliovirus type 3 was fused to the C terminus of the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat protein and the fusion protein expressed in E. coil [44] . As with wild-type coat protein, the modified protein could assemble into helical virus-like rods when extracts were acidified, greatly aiding purification. The purified rods were shown to be able to elicit the production of anti-poliovirus neutralizing antibodies in rats. More recently, it has been shown that co-expression in E. coil of both the TMV coat protein and single-stranded RNAs containing the TMV origin of assembly can give virus-like particles without the need to acidify the medium [45] . Because RNA-containing particles are more stable than protein-only helices, especially at higher pHs, the latter system could be adapted as an improved way of expressing foreign sequences on TMV virus-like particles. The second plant virus coat protein to be used was from the potyvirus Johnsongrass mosaic virus. Epitopes can be fused to either the N or C terminus of the protein without abolishing the ability of the protein to polymerize into virus-like particles when expressed in E. coil [46] . In one case, the assembled particles were shown to be capable of raising an appropriate immune response in mice.",

In the case of poliovirus, foreign inserts have been expressed as replacements in the 13B-13C loop (Fig. 2) of VP1 and in a number of cases, the particles have been shown to be immunogenic [47, 48] .

Examination of the structure revealed that there were changes not only in the conformation of the inserted loop but also in the neighbouring loops that were required to accommodate the new sequence.

To generate viable chimaeras displaying sequences from the V3 loop of HIV-1, a system of random systematic mutagenesis of the sequences flanking the conserved hexapeptide was employed [51\"\u00b0] . Fifteen out of 25 chimaeras produced in this way were neutralized by one or more of a panel of four anti HIV-1 V3 loop antibodies. The differing responses observed indicate that the flanking residues have a major effect on the antigenicity of the presented sequence. Using a technique related to that used in phage display technology, it has proved possible to immunoselect particularly interesting rhinovirus-based chimaeras from a library. [52, 53] .",

Clearly the optimization of the sites of insertion to achieve the highest possible levels of antigenicity/immunogenicity of an expressed peptides is an important stage in the development of novel vaccines. The increasing availability of data regarding the structures of self-assembling proteins should assist the identification of such sites. Of possibly even greater significance is the prospect of being able to determine the structure of peptide when expressed on the surface of a heterologous particle and to correlate changes in immunogenicity with variations in the 3D structure of the insert. This could lead to 'fine tuning' of expression systems so that they fully realize their potential.",

The structure of a mutant of M13 harbouring a five amino acid insertion near the N terminus of the major coat protein (pVlll) was determined to 7 resolution by fibre diffraction. Examination of the structure reveals that the inserted sequence is presented in an extended conformation between two helices on the surface of the virions, mimicking the presentation of peptides in an MHC complex. This configuration may contribute to the high level of immunogenicity of peptides presented at the N terminus of gp8. This paper represents the first example of the determination of the structure of a peptide as presented on the surface of a heterologous particle. . Bacteriophage X is used as a presentation system, with peptides being added to the N terminus of the 11 kDa D protein present in 420 copies on the T=7 lattice on the virus head. To produce large protein D fusion display libraries without having to clone many fragments of DNA directly into X DNA, the authors use a site-specific recombination system in vivo to incorporate plasmids encoding D fusions into the phage genome. Assembly of the bacteriophage occurs normally and the peptide is accessible on the virus surface. The system will probably be most useful for the display of sequences obtained from cDNA libraries.",

Likewise, it has proved possible to express sequences on a surface loop of the viral coat [64\u2022].

For all four constructs, mice immunized with the chimaeric particles were partially protected against challenge with a lethal dose of the appropriate pathogen[41\u00b0]. In an alternative system, the minor capsid protein, VP1, of parvovirus B19 was modified to express a 147 amino acid sequence from hen egg white lysozyme.
