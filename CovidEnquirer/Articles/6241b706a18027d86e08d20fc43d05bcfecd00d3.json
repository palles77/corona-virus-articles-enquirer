            "text": "Notwithstanding, our molecular understanding of the very large number of protein complexes in the cell remains limited to a handful of examples for which detailed nearatomic structures are known. This is mostly because of the difficulty in obtaining samples in sufficient quality and quantity for molecular studies. Many essential complexes remain intractable because they exist in very low amounts in their endogenous host, which hinders their purification Review Glossary Cre recombinase: Enzyme that recognizes, binds to, cuts and religates specific DNA sequences (called LoxP sequences). Four copies of Cre recombinase bind to two LoxP DNA sequences, and then Cre recombinase exchanges one strand each from the two LoxP sequences. If the two LoxP sequences are present on two different DNA molecules, then these will be conjoined as a result, resulting in one DNA molecule with two LoxP sites. Homing endonucleases: Restriction enzymes with particularly long (20-30 base pairs) recognition sequences. After cutting the DNA, they often leave fournucleotide overhangs that can be compatible with overhangs generated by another restriction enzyme, BstXI; then, DNAs processed with homing endonucleases can be efficiently ligated to DNAs tailored by BstXI. Both recognition sequences are destroyed in the process, and the ligation product cannot be cut by either enzyme. Ligation independent cloning (LIC): A method for inserting DNA sequences (i.e. genes) into a plasmid DNA molecule without using DNA ligase. DNAs to be conjoined are treated by exonucleases that trim back one strand of the DNA double helix, exposing the complementary strand as a long sticky end. If two DNA molecules have complementary sticky ends, they can be conjoined simply by mixing. LIC methods have become popular in recent years because they do not require preselected DNA sequences that serve as recognition sites for restriction enzymes. A version of LIC that is entirely independent of any DNA sequence is called SLIC (sequence and ligation independent cloning). LoxP sequence: Short imperfect inverted repeat of 34 base pairs which serves as a recognition site, cleavage site and religation site for Cre recombinase. The LoxP sequence is not symmetric, therefore, the conjoining of two LoxP sequences by Cre recombinase is directional. Nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV): NPV attacks caterpillars, such as the larvae of the alfalfa looper or the silkworm. NPVs are highly specific for their host and thus useful as pest control agents. Polyprotein: Long polypeptide which contains several individual proteins that are connected by linker amino acids which either are capable of self-cleavage, or are recognition and cleavage sites of highly specific proteases. Tn7 transposon: Originally discovered as a large (14 kb) DNA segment from Tn7 phage, which can insert into a specific location in the E. coli genome. The transposon encodes the Tn7 transposase, a four-subunit protein complex that carries out this insertion reaction. Three DNA elements are minimally required for this reaction: the Tn7L and Tn7R DNA sequences which flank the DNA to be transposed, and a sequence called Tn7 attachment site (attTn7) into which the transposed DNA is inserted. This insertion mechanism can be efficiently exploited to conjoin recombinant DNA by providing the Tn7L and Tn7R sequences on a plasmid at each end of a DNA sequence of interest, and the attTn7 sequence on another DNA which will serve as recipient. The reaction is started by addition of the transposase to these DNAs. Corresponding author: Berger, I. (iberger@embl.fr). from native source material. Recombinant overproduction can resolve this bottleneck, and numerous expression systems, mostly for heterologous protein expression in Escherichia coli, have been developed and refined over the past few decades. More recently, E. coli expression systems have been designed for coexpression of several proteins by using polycistronic mRNA transcripts, or two or more plasmids that coexist in the same cell [10, 11] (Box 1). However, many eukaryotic protein complexes cannot be produced efficiently in E. coli. They may contain subunits that are too large for the E. coli transcription and translation machinery, or may require either specific chaperone systems for proper folding or protein modifications (such as phosphorylation or acetylation) that E. coli cannot provide. Thus, the successful overproduction of these complexes, which is required to decipher their structure and function, depends on the availability of powerful eukaryotic expression technologies. In this review, we describe MultiBac, a Box 1. Coexpression toolbox for production of protein complexes Expression systems for production of protein complexes in E. coli frequently make use of polycistronic expression cassettes with several genes of interest, spaced apart by ribosome binding sites (Shine-Dalgarno sequences), placed under the control of a single promoter, and typically followed by a sequence for efficient termination of mRNA transcription [10, 11, 21, [60] [61] [62] (Figure Ia) . In eukaryotic hosts, an analogous design can involve internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs), which are inserted between gene coding regions under control of a single promoter [24] [25] [26] [27] (Figure Ib ). IRESs exist in the 5 0untranslated regions of many viral and cellular mRNAs [24] , and facilitate cap-independent translation by recruiting ribosomes for efficient protein production. IRES sequences differ greatly and exhibit species specificity [26] . For example, IRES elements from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) work well in mammalian cells, whereas IRESs from Perina nuda virus (PhV) and Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV) have been successfully used for protein complex production in insect cells [27] .",

Polyprotein approaches have proven to be particularly powerful for balancing the stoichiometry of coexpressed proteins [22, [28] [29] [30] (Figure Ic) . Polyprotein constructions can involve self-cleaving peptides found in picornavirus (called P2A peptides) or variants thereof [28, 29] . Alternatively, constructions can be used that mimic open reading frames in positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses and provide a highly specific protease gene together with genes of interest arranged in a single large open reading frame [22, 30] . Individual proteins are then liberated from the encoded polyprotein by the protease, which cleaves the proteolytic sites placed between the protein subunits ( Figure Ic) .",

The interacting partner is provided in the form of a random incremental library generated by exonuclease digestion of the full-length gene. Prior input from bioinformatics analyses such as homology alignments or domain identification is not required for this approach. Coexpression of the library with the bait protein allows identification of soluble complexes by immunofluorescence-assisted colony screening using labeled antibody markers against affinity tags present on the proteins screened.

The presence of many subunits in a protein complex requires the assembly of many encoding genes and their integration into the baculovirus in a multicomponent co-production experiment. This process is laborious and technically challenging using conventional methods that typically involve serial insertion of genes into increasingly large and difficult-to-handle DNA plasmids. MultiBac applies a different concept for multigene assembly that relies on recombination of small, custom-designed, synthetic DNA plasmid molecules (< 3 kb) that are called 'acceptors' and 'donors' (Figure 1a ).",

These are achieved in vitro MultiBac consists of an array of small (3 kb), synthetic DNA plasmids called acceptors and donors. Acceptors have a regular origin of replication (ori ColE1 ), whereas donors have a conditional origin derived from R6Kg phage (ori R6kg ) that requires special bacterial strains for their propagation. Donors and acceptors contain expression cassettes controlled by late baculoviral promoters (polh or p10) as well as strong eukaryotic polyadenylation signals (from SV40 or HSVtk). All plasmids contain the LoxP sequence (circles filled in red) for fusing donors to an acceptor by the Cre recombinase. Each plasmid has a different resistant marker: gentamycin resistance (Gn R ) for acceptors, and either chloramphenicol (Cm R ), kanamycin (Kn R ) or spectinomycin (Sp R ) resistance for donors. In addition, a 'multiplication' module is present to facilitate the assembly of several expression cassettes on a donor or acceptor based on specifically designed restriction sites (e.g. homing endonucleases and BstXI restriction endonuclease, shown as blue boxes flanking promoter and terminator, respectively) [18, 19, 21] . Acceptors contain the DNA sequences (Tn7L and Tn7R) required for transposition by the Tn7 transposase. (b) The assembly of a composite MultiBac baculoviral genome for multigene expression. Genes are inserted into donors and acceptors by using either restriction endonucleases and ligase, or sequence-independent and ligation-independent cloning methods (bottom). Cre-mediated fusion produces a multigene construction that is inserted into the baculoviral genome by Tn7 transposition in specifically tailored E. coli cells that contain the viral DNA (also known as a bacmid). The DNA located between the Tn7R and Tn7L sequences in the multigene fusion construct is inserted by the transposase enzyme into the Tn7 attachment site (mini-attTn7). The MultiBac baculovirus was engineered for improved protein production and delayed host cell lysis by deleting specific genes [12] . The combination of sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) for gene insertion and Cre-LoxP fusion for multigene construct generation is called tandem recombineering and can be performed in a parallelized mode on microtiter plates, optionally on a robot [21] . Further heterologous genes can be inserted into an additional LoxP site present on the bacmid. Composite baculoviral DNA is then purified from the bacteria and used to transfect insect cells. Virus is expanded by infecting small-volume (50-100 ml) insect cell cultures and harvesting the budded virus particles released into the culture media. This virus is then used for protein complex expression in larger (typically one to several liters) insect cell cultures [13, 20] .",

The process of inserting genes into acceptors and donors, which can be optionally done by ligation independent methods followed by Cre-LoxP fusion, is termed 'tandem recombineering' [22] .",

            "text": "Gene insertions into the MultiBac genome take place in bacterial strains that contain the MultiBac viral genome as an artificial chromosome together with a plasmid encoding the Tn7 transposon enzyme complex. Multigene acceptordonor fusion constructs are transformed into these bacterial cells, and the Tn7 transposon enzyme inserts the collection of expression cassettes present on the acceptor-donor fusion in a single-step reaction into the Tn7 attachment site engineered into the baculoviral genome ( Figure 1b) . Productive transposition disrupts a LacZaencoding gene, which enables blue/white screening of colonies. The MultiBac baculoviral genome has been engineered for improved protein complex production by removing genes encoding viral protease and apoptotic activities, thereby reducing proteolytic breakdown of the heterologous gene products and delaying lysis of the infected cells [12, 13] . As a second site of entry in addition to the Tn7 attachment site, the MultiBac genome contains also a distal LoxP site for adding further functionalities. For example, a gene encoding l-phosphatase was inserted into this site to remove phosphates from a coexpressed protein complex [23] . The composite MultiBac virus is then purified and used to transfect insect cells for protein production in Petri dishes containing cell monolayers or, for larger volumes, shaker flasks containing suspension cultures [13, 19, 20] . MultiBac resolves several challenges encountered in protein complex production. These include constraints on handling many and often very large encoding DNAs and the necessity to revise expression experiments rapidly and flexibly if a subunit or purification tag needs to be altered or exchanged, by replacing the respective donor or acceptor with a modified version in the tandem recombineering pipeline.",

An example is the coatomer, the central protein component that covers certain vesicles, known as coat protein I (COPI)-coated vesicles, which are thought to play an important role in the early secretory pathway. Coatomer consists of seven subunits and exists in four isoforms of different subunit composition. The four isoforms co-purify when extracted from animal tissue, which hampers their structural analysis and impedes attempts to understand the potentially different functions of the individual isoforms.

            "text": "Mediator is a large multiprotein complex that is central to gene expression in eukaryotes and is organized into three modules termed head, middle or arm, and tail [63] . The size and complexity of Mediator has long posed a major challenge for structural studies. Mediator head (seven subunits, 223 kDa) was first successfully produced recombinantly by infecting insect cells with single baculoviruses, each encoding one subunit, opening the door for structural studies [36] . However, this procedure required lengthy optimization to indentify suitable, highly producing recombinant baculoviruses by repeated rounds of laborious screeninga process of 8 weeks or longer for each baculovirus. The demanding procedures constrained logistics and severely compromised attempts at structure determination of Mediator head by X-ray crystallography, which typically necessitates flexible, stream-lined and efficient production protocols for generating many variants of the protein specimen studied. The MultiBac system elegantly resolved this fundamental impediment [35] . All genes encoding the subunits of the Mediator head module were inserted into a single MultiBac baculovirus by using tandem recombineering [36, 64] . Combinatorial assembly of the genes lead to a series of MultiBac baculoviruses encoding either full Mediator head (Med17, Med6, Med18, Med8, Med20, Med11 and Med22) or subcomplexes including core head (Med17, Med6, Med8, Med11 and Med22) and mini head (Med17, Med11 and Med22). Investigation of these complexes by EM allowed initial assignment of subunit positions [64] . Modification of Med17 and Med18 by eliminating flexible regions was crucial to obtain diffraction-quality head module crystals, and this was easily accomplished by simply exchanging the respective unmodified genes in the original MultiBac baculovirus expressing the full head [35] . The modular acceptor-donor construction principle of MultiBac is crucial to facilitate this alteration, alleviating a need to assemble the entire multigene construct every time again de novo. The recombinant head module has been purified and crystallized, and the architecture of this 223-kDa complex has been determined by X-ray crystallography ( Figure I) . The crystal structure of the Mediator head reveals how this essential complex is built from its components to provide stability as well as flexibility for transcription regulation, resulting in a platform for other transcription factors [35] . Notably, a portion of the head named 'neck domain' confers stability and integrity of the complex by forming a striking, novel multihelical bundle, engaging five of the seven subunits of Mediator head. These impressive results have prompted the development of a version of the MultiBac system adjusted for protein complex production in a silkworm bioreactor [41] . In this system, the original baculovirus genome was replaced with that of a B. mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus (BmNPV), likewise provided as an artificial chromosome in bacterial cells. A Tn7 attachment site was introduced into this BmNPV genome, and a plasmid expressing the Tn7 transposon complex was co-transformed. Thus, the silkworm MultiBac system retains the ability to accept multigene vector constructions prepared by tandem recombineering or by conventional restriction and ligation cloning. A distinct feature of the B. mori MultiBac system is the method of infecting the silkworms, which occurs via injection of virus solution with a needle. Protein complexes are then purified from the hemolymph of infected silkworms after several days.",

Originally, tandem recombineering was developed for generating multiexpression plasmids for production of protein complexes in E. coli to alleviate imbalances in expression levels observed with multiplasmid co-transformation [21] . Expression of protein complexes in mammalian cells can be achieved by transfection with multiple plasmids, in analogy to multiplasmid co-transformation in E. coli. However, this approach can lead to imbalanced production from the plasmids and to heterogeneous cell populations with differences in the ratio of plasmids incorporated. This impediment can be efficiently resolved by using a single plasmid that contains all the heterologous genes. This multigene plasmid can be conveniently generated by tandem recombineering of properly modified acceptors and donors, in which the baculoviral promoters are exchanged for mammalian promoters [22, 42] . The resulting multigene plasmid is introduced into mammalian cells by using a transfection reagent [42] .",

Therefore, mutations that abolish the modification activity must be introduced in the host genome, or enzymes (such as l-phosphatase) that remove the modification have to be coexpressed or supplied [23] .

A highly efficient scale-up protocol for rAAV production utilizes recombinant baculoviruses to produce gene-therapy-competent rAAV particles in insect cell cultures [48] [49] [50] [51] . This protocol involves three recombinant baculoviruses that carry genes encoding different components of rAAV and the transgene to be delivered (Figure 3 ).

It may seem frivolous to set out with MultiBac to address this complexity structurally and functionally in a defined, fully recombinant setup.

Application of the MultiBac system in gene therapy. rAAV particles are produced by co-infection with three different baculoviruses [48, 49] . Bac-Rep harbors two expression cassettes that contain genes for the major AAV replication enzyme, Rep78, and an N-terminal truncation of Rep78, Rep52D. rAAV-Bac contains AAV inverted terminal repeat (ITR) elements that are required for rescue, replication and packaging of transgene sequences, together with rat leptin cDNA under the control of a chicken b-actin promoter, which is inserted into the rAAV-Bac baculoviral genome by Cre-LoxP-mediated fusion of a specifically tailored donor plasmid [52] . Leptin is a hormone that acts in the brain to reduce food intake and stimulate energy expenditure. Bac-VP produces the AAV virion coat proteins. Complete rAAV virions containing the leptin gene are produced in triply co-infected insect cells and purified [50, 52] , and then administered to dietinduced obese rats. An obese rat is shown compared to a normal rat for illustration (bottom). Diet-induced obesity renders laboratory rats (and presumably other species) resistant to leptin treatment. Therefore, it is close to impossible to curtail diet-induced weight gain. This could be overcome by circumventing leptin resistance or restoring leptin actions in obese animals. The surprising outcome of the study involving baculovirus-produced leptin rAAV as a gene therapy vector was that exercise, in this study wheel-running, was required to prevent completely weight gain when combined with the leptin gene therapy intervention, leading to the conclusion that work-out, in tandem with leptin gene delivery, may actually develop into a potential antiobesity treatment [52] . The baculovirus schematic drawing is adapted from an image kindly supplied by K. J. Airenne (University of Kuopio, Finland). The rAAV particles shown are based on PDB entry 1LP3 [59] .",

            "text": "Tools for expression of protein complexes. (a) Protein complexes can be produced efficiently in E. coli by using polycistrons. In polycistrons, genes of interest are spaced apart by ribosome binding sites (rbs) and placed under control of a single promoter (Prom). A sequence (Term) ensures termination of mRNA transcription. One or several polycistrons can be provided on one or more plasmids simultaneously in one cell. (b) The equivalent construction for eukaryotic expression provides IRESs instead of rbs, resulting also in polycistronic mRNAs. (c) Polyproteins are particularly useful to balance the stoichiometry of expressed proteins. Polyprotein constructions can provide self-cleaving peptides derived from picornavirus (2A) in between the individual proteins (top). A fluorescent protein (here CFP) can be included to facilitate tracking of heterologous expression from the respective promoter by fluorescence measurement. As an alternative, polyproteins can be used that contain a highly specific protease [here tobacco etch virus (TEV) Nla], which processes the polyprotein by cleaving corresponding cleavage sites (tcs), thus liberating the individual proteins including itself (bottom). Both polyprotein strategies have the drawback of decorating the C terminus of the preceding protein with overhanging residues that are part of the cleavage sequence (boxed). Asterisks denote sites of cleavage. Conserved residues defining the site are in bold. C-terminal overhangs are underlined.",
