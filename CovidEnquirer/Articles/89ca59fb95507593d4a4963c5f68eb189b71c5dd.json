            "text": "The first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were identified in November, 2002, in Guangdong Province, China. By April, 2003, the epidemic had spread worldwide, affecting 3547 individuals resulting in 182 deaths. 1 In March, 2003, the putative cause of SARS was identified as a new coronavirus. 2, 3 Oropharyngeal specimens from patients with SARS induced a cytopathic effect on Vero E6 tissue culture cells and revealed the presence of coronavirus-like particles. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis with random or broadly-specific coronavirus primers amplified a DNA fragment that resembled, but was distinct from, known coronavirus genomes. When tested, these diagnostic PCR methods detected the SARS virus in many clinical samples taken from affected patients. In addition, serological evidence has shown the presence of antibodies specific to the new coronavirus in the serum of patients with SARS. 4 Collectively, these data strongly implicate the new coronavirus as the cause of SARS, which we designate as SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV is a member of the Coronoviridae family of enveloped, POSITIVE-STRANDED RNA VIRUSES, which have a broad host range. Some coronavirus infections in people, cattle, and birds cause respiratory disease, whereas other coronavirus infections in rodents, cats, pigs, and cattle lead to enteric disease. The 27-32 kb genomes of coronaviruses, the largest of RNA viruses, encode 23 putative proteins, including four major structural proteins; nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and small envelope (E). The spike protein, a glycoprotein projection on the viral surface, is crucial for viral attachment and entry into the host cell. In addition, variations of S protein among strains of coronavirus are responsible for host range and tissue tropism. 5 Differences in virulence of mice coronaviruses have also been linked to genetic variance in the S protein. 6, 7 and the serological response in the host is typically raised against the S protein. 8 However, the S, M, and N mature proteins all contribute to generating the host immune response as seen in transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, 9 infectious bronchitis virus, 10, 11 pig respiratory coronavirus, 12 and mouse hepatitis virus. 13 A characteristic of RNA viruses is the high rate of genetic mutation, which leads to evolution of new viral strains and is a mechanism by which viruses escape host defenses. Therefore, from a public-health perspective, understanding the mutation rate of the SARS virus as it spreads through the population is important. Moreover, the genetic mutability of SARS-CoV, especially in the segments encoding the major antigenic proteins, would also have an effect on development of broadly effective vaccines.",

We then used this sequence-specific priming approach to generate reverse transcriptase-PCR fragments for the five whole viral genomes. Each PCR fragment was directly sequenced from both directions inward and outward, in duplicate. Therefore, for any region of the genome there was six to eight-fold coverage. We used the PHRED/PHRAP/CONSED package (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; http://www.phred.org) to process all the raw sequence reads for base calling, assembly, and editing. Nucleotide differences in the assembled genome sequences were also checked manually for accuracy.

In total, there were 127 single nucleotide sequence variations, one deletion of six nucleotides (nt 27782-27787) in strain SIN2677, and one deletion of five nucleotides (nt 27810-27814) in strain SIN2748 (webappendix 2, http://image.thelancet.com/extras/ 03art4454webappendix2.pdf). Both these deletion sites were in the noncoding sequences between an uncharacterised open reading frame and the nucleocapsid protein. Of the 127 base substitutions, 94 changed the aminoacid sequence (webappendix 2). The mutations were in the following open reading frames: orf1a polyprotein, orf1a RNA-polymerase, orf1ab: nsp10 to nsp 13, spike glycoprotein, membrane nucleocapsid, and several uncharacterised putative proteins.",

Mutations that might have been artifacts of cell culture would occur only once in our survey, whereas sequence variants associated with common ancestry should be seen in multiple isolates. Of the 127 sequence variations in the 14 isolates, 16 variant loci were identified in two or more isolates, and eight were seen in three or more isolates ( figure 3 ). With the more stringent criterion, four loci recurred five or more times in the 14 SARS-CoVs analysed: C/T polymorphisms at position 9404 resulting in a valine to alanine change in orf1a (nsp1); position 19 084 leading to an isoleucine to threonine change in orf1ab (nsp11); position 22 222 changing an isoleucine residue to threonine in the S1 portion of the spike protein, and position 27 827 which is in a non-coding region ( figure  3 ). In addition, a T/G polymorphism is noted at position 17 564 changing orf1ab (nsp10, helicase domain) from an aspartic acid to a glutamic acid. Sequence variants at these four loci segregate together as a specific genotype. Assuming that all base substitutions were random events propagated in the Vero cells, the probability of four specific nucleotide changes occurring concurrently is very low. The significance is at p<10 -60 when the null hypothesis is that each locus in each sample mutates independently, and p<10 -15 when dependence is allowed among the loci. The C:G:C:C and T:T:T:T genotypes are, therefore, very unlikely to have emerged by chance, and might be evidence for the first genetic signature of strain differences in the SARS virus. All isolates with the T:T:T:T genotype were linked to infection acquired at the Hotel M in Hong Kong, 18 whereas none of the C:G:C:C genotype isolates had this association ( figure 3 ). Phylogenetic analysis based on the common variant sequences (defined as present in two or more isolates) confirmed that the cases associated with exposure in the Hotel M formed a cluster that was distinct from the other isolates ( figure 4) . On the basis of the molecular and contact history, we have reconstructed a probable lineage map of the SARS-CoV infections investigated here ( figure 5 ).",

The variant sequences at position 19 084 seem to distinguish the Singaporean isolates from all others. Although all nine isolates from outside Singapore showed a C at this position, four of the five isolates from Singapore had a T. The only reversion from T to a C in SIN2679 (a secondary contact case) might be the result of a backmutational event potentially occurring during the passage of the virus. Taking into account missing data, the polymorphisms at nucleotide positions 9854, 19 838, and 27 243 all segregate with isolates identified specifically in Beijing. Thus, these common sequence polymorphisms might be useful in identifying the differential source of a SARS viral infection.",

            "text": "Although the genome organisation of SARS-CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV sequence is only distantly related to any coronavirus member. Results of earlier reports 4 suggested that SARS-CoV more closely resembled the cow coronavirus and the mouse hepatitis virus by comparing a conserved 215 aminoacid segment of the polymerase protein product. However, when taking into account the entire genomic sequence, the strength of the associations was reduced, confirming the reports of others that the SARS coronavirus is a completely new pathogenic strain that does not arise from a simple recombination of known existing strains. 2, 21 Since the S1 subunit of the spike protein is the major antigenic moiety for coronaviruses and is not an essential structural protein, it is prone to high mutation rates as the virus evolves in host populations. That the S1 region did not seem to have excessive numbers of base substitutions suggests that the viral isolates have not been subject to immunological selection. 22, 23 However, because all samples were from viral cultures propagated in Vero cells, some, if not most, of these 129 mutations might have occurred during in-vitro expansion and not because of host pressures. 24 In addition, some of the available nucleotide substitutions might have been the result of sequencing errors since several of the sequences were submitted in draft form. To reduce the effects of these technical artifacts, we restricted our analysis to the 16 loci with recurrent mutations among the 14 isolates. These loci are the sequence variants most likely to have been resident in human populations.",
