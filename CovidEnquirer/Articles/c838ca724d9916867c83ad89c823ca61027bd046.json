However, deletions affecting the second hydrophobic domain (mutants 42-61, 43-61, 47-61) showed immunofluorescent localization of.VP7 which coincided with that of wheat germ agglutinin, indicating transport to the Golgi apparatus. Immunoprecipitable wild-type protein, or an altered protein lacking the first hydrophobic sequence, remained intracellular and endo-~-N-acetylglucosaminidase H sensitive. In contrast, products of mutants 42-61, 43-61, and 47-61 were transported from the ER, and secreted. Glycosylation of the secreted molecules was inhibited by tunicamycin, resistant to endo-~-Nacetylglucosaminidase H digestion and therefore of the N-linked complex type. An unglycosylated version of VP7 was also secreted. We suggest that the second hydrophobic domain contributes to a positive signal for ER location and a membrane anchor function. Secretion of the mutant glycoprotein implies that transport can be constitutive with the destination being dictated by an overriding compartmentalization signal.",

Alterations of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail had diverse effects. Some mutant proteins became blocked along the secretory pathway and others failed to traverse the pathway at all. The exact nature of the signal for targeting these proteins to the plasma membrane was not clear from these studies. Failure of these molecules to move along the exocytosis pathway may have been due to the alteration of a positive plasma membrane targeting signal or to denaturation of the protein product.",

            "text": "Rotavirus VP7 is a glycoprotein of particular interest as a potential model for the study of protein transport (21) . This protein associates with viral cores that bud into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) j (1) from cytoplasmic structures, called viroplasms. Mature virus remains within the lumen of the RER until release by cell lysis. VP7 is an integral membrane glycoprotein with a lumenal orientation (21) and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (10, 32). The Golgi apparatus is not involved in processing the mature form of VPT, a fact confirmed by the presence on the molecule of the high-mannose form of carbohydrate (9) . VP7 therefore constitutes an example of a membrane glycoprotein that is targeted to the ER and is not subsequently directed further along the secretory pathway. The cloning and sequencing of the SA 11 VP7 gene revealed the presence of two tandem NH2-terminal hydrophobic domains in the protein, and the absence of a COOH-terminal hydrophobic domain (7) . Each of the hydrophobic domains is preceded by an AUG codon and could ostensibly serve as a signal peptide for the translocation of VP7, depending on which codon is read for initiation. However, the specific role of each of these codons and hydrophobic segments in VP7 synthesis is not clear. In studying the function of the hydrophobic domains, we constructed a series of deletions in the VP7 gene. Three mutants were obtained for which the VP7 proteins acquired complex carbohydrate, as distinct from the high-mannose type exhibited by wild-type VP7, showing that they traversed the secretory pathway and reached the Golgi apparatus. These proteins were also secreted. A priori, the transport of VP7 to more distal locations along the secretory route should require either the modification of a positive signal specifying ER location, or alternatively, the addition of a signal enabling vectorial transport to occur. The induction of VP7 secretion by creating various deletions in the protein is more easily explained by the disruption of a positive signal specifying ER location. We conclude that there must be a positive signal for retention of a protein in the ER. Since wild-type VP7 is naive to the secretory pathway, it is also implied that in the absence of overriding sorting signals, secretion is constitutive.",

This yielded a VP7 clone inserted in the Pst I site of pBR322 which was confirmed as full length by terminal sequence analysis (30) . The insert was excised with Pst I, digested with nuclease Bal 31 to remove G:C homopolymer tails, and the blunt-ended molecule was flanked with Xho I sites by the addition of phosphorylated Xho I linkers (P-L Bioehemicals revealed that pJC 16 nevertheless contained residual homopolymeric sequences (15G residues) at the 5'-end of the gene. These were removed by replacing the 5'-terminal region of the clone proximal to the Nco I site with a fragment that lacked the residual homopolymeric tail. An Aha llI-Nco I fragment was prepared from the SAIl VP7 clone, Xho I linkers were added to the Aha III end, and after recutting, the Xho l-Nco I fragment was cloned into the SV40 vector to generate the plasmid pJC9 (Fig. 1 ).",

The viroplasm structures immediately adjacent to the RER were also evident and viral cores could be seen budding from the periphery of the viroplasm into the lumen of the RER. The envelope acquired from the RER membrane was subsequently lost and both enveloped and mature virions were visible in the lumenal space (Fig. 3) . VP7 has been located to the ER by immunoelectron microscopy (10, 32). In vitro translation studies have also shown it to be an integral membrane protein (2 I). Since the VP7 protein is found in mature virions and has only highmannose oligosaccharides (9), the data collectively show that VP7 remains in the ER after translation. However, the mechanism by which VP7 is incorporated into the virus remains unknown. Thus, the rotavirus VP7 provides an opportunity to study the factors controlling the specific localization of proteins to the ER.",

The expression of the VP7 protein from this gene was examined in transfected COS 7 cells to confirm the ER location of this protein. An indirect immunofluorescent procedure using a secondary fluorescein-coupled goat antirabbit Ig and a primary monospecific polyclonal rabbit anti. serum was used to localize VP7. A concomitant display of WGA, conjugated to rbodamine (R-WGA), and known to specifically bind to sialic acid and terminal glucosamines in the Golgi apparatus (40), allowed us to determine if VP7 was present in this organelle. The immunolocalizafion of VP7 expressed from pJC9 shows a distinct, arborizing, reticular pattern of fluorescein staining radiating from the nucleus, and a perinuclear concentration of stained, reticular material (Fig. These are composed of several viral proteins and nucleic acid which assemble into viral cores (arrows) that bud from the periphery of the viroplasm into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Immature viral particles with surrounding ER membrane appear in the lumen of the ER (large black arrowheads), as do numerous, nonenveloped, mature forms of the virion which are devoid of membrane (small black arrowheads). Several viral particles are indicated which apparently are in the process of losing the surrounding membrane (white arrowheads); possible membrane remnants can also be seen (m). M, mitochondrion, x 41,500. 5). This probably corresponds to the RER and to transitional elements of ER, spatially related to, but exclusive of, the Golgi apparatus (see Fig. 4b and inset). Nuclear staining is also evident. Fig. 5 b shows the same cell stained with R-WGA. A staining pattern consisting of punctate material and a perinuclear localization, probably coincident with part of the Golgi apparatus and distinct from that of the VP7 localization, is seen. Thus, VP7 protein expressed from the wild-type gene in pJC9 appears to localize to the ER and does not appear to reach the Golgi apparatus.",

In the case of mutant 51-61, it is possible that the lower molecular weight band arises from use of the third in-frame AUG as a start The immunofluorescent localization of VP7 (left column) compared with that of R-WGA (right column) in transfected COS 7 cells. Fluorescein coupled to goat anti-rabbit IgG was used secondary to primary rabbit polyclonal antiserum to immunolocalize VP7. All pairs were photographed in the same plane of focus. Cells transfected with pJC9 (a and b); mutants 1-14 (c and d); 2-8 (e and/); 42-61 (g and h); 43-61 (i and j); 47-61 (k and/); or 51-61 (m and n). VP7 is localized to an arborizing structure probably corresponding to ER, as well as to a perinuclear reticular structure, possibly transitional ER elements, which are distinct from but close to that of the perinuclear punctate stain for WGA and the Golgi apparatus as displayed in a-f, and m and n. In some cases, a negative image of the staining region of VP7 is seen for WGA (c and d). By contrast, the three deletions shown in g-I not only exhibit the ER reticular localization for VP7, but also a prominent perinuclear staining region that is precisely coincident with, or a subset of, the staining pattern for WGA. \u00d7 126. codon. This possibility is made less likely because for mutant 42-6l a similar unglycosylated band of the same size is secreted, implying the use of a functional signal which would not be translated if the third AUG was used as an initiation codon. The wild-type and mutant genes each expressed a product which was sensitive to endo-H (Fig. 6, + lanes) , indicating that they were glycosylated with N-linked, highmannose oligosaccharides. There was no significant intracellular pool of VP7 products that were resistant to endo-H (Fig.  6 ). Cells were transfected and then incubated in the presence or absence of tunicamycin and the resulting unglycosylated products were slightly smaller in size than those treated with endo-H (data not shown), again indicating the N-linked nature of the oligosaccharide. Taken together, these results imply that each mutant codes for proteins which retain a functional signal for translocation into the ER. For the 1-14 deletion, where only the second ATG and hydrophobic domain are retained, the latter probably constitutes the signal peptide. For the wild-type and other mutants, the translocation signal domain cannot be specified since both ATG codons and hydrophobic regions are present. Transfected cells labeled for 2.5 h showed an overall similar pattern of expression of the intracellular VP7 products, and again there was little evidence of intracellular material resistant to endo-H (data not shown).",

Therefore, the incubation media from all the transfected cell cultures described above were examined for secreted VP7 products. Three of the deletion mutants, 42-61, 43-6 l, and 47-61, affecting the distal region of the second hydrophobic domain produced VP7 molecules which were secreted (Fig.  7) , in marked contrast to the behavior of the wild-type VP7 (pJC9), and the other mutants (51-61 in particular) (Fig. 7) . The latter differed by only four amino acids from the secreted 2206 THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY \u2022 VOLUME 101, 1985 mutant 47-61 (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the secreted VP7 products were endo-H resistant (Fig. 7, + lanes) , consistent with their passage through the Golgi apparatus and their modification to the complex type of carbohydrate. Densitometry of respective bands of original autoradiographs used for Figs. 6 and 7, which were equivalently exposed, showed that similar amounts of secreted and intracellular VP7 were present. These results pertain to cells labeled for 4 h. However, similar results were obtained in a 2.5-h labeling period (data not shown), indicating that secretion is an efficient process. The size of the VP7 which contained complex oligosaccharides (VP7 c) was slightly larger than that of VP7 with the high-mannose form of glycosylation (VP7) (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 7) as expected from the known higher molecular weight of complex N-linked oligosaccharides. Mutant 42-61 also secretes, based on its size, a nonglycosylated version of its mutant VP7 protein (Fig.  7) . This was confirmed by another experiment where cultures transfected with mutants 42-6 l, 43-6 l, or 47-61 were subsequently treated with tunicamycin ( Fig. 8 , mutant 43-6 l only shown). The product generated in the presence of tunicamycin (Fig. 8 , + lanes) (VP7 u) is identical in size to the naturally occurring unglycosylated product of mutant 42-6 l (Fig. 7) . Some material the size of VP7 remained after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 8, lane 8) probably because of limiting amounts of the drug, since in other experiments tunicamycin resulted in complete conversion to VP7 u. In control cells, those not treated with tunicamycin (Fig. 8, lane 5) , the endo-H-resistant product was again secreted into the medium. Similar results were obtained with mutants 42-61 and 47-61 (data not shown). The amount of protein secreted in tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig. 8, lane 6) was lower than that of the control, possibly because the drug interferes with secretion. No such bands were identified when the vector (pJC 119), without VP7 gene insert, was used for transfection (Fig. 8,   lanes 1-4) . The presence of prominent nonspecific background bands (Fig. 8, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 6-8) , which are different for the intracellular (intra) and secreted (sec) lanes, does not alter this conclusion. These results confirm that the FIGURE 7 Endo-H sensitivity of immunoprecipitated products from the media of cells transfected with wild-type and mutated VP7 genes.

ER location implies either the presence of a targeting signal specific for the ER or the absence of a positive signal that would otherwise direct the protein elsewhere. The structural glycoprotein VP7, of the rotavirus SA11, provides just such a naturally targeted ER protein. It is a membrane glycoprotein (21) before assembly into virus. How the transfer of the glycoprotein takes place is not known and we know of no other animal virus which exhibits this behavior.

            "text": "Other glycoproteins of the ER have been cloned and some sequenced. In the cases of HMG-CoA reductase (27) and coronavirus E 1 (4), there was no obvious homology between the NH2-terminal hydrophobic domains in these molecules and VP7, nor with the dual NH2-terminal hydrophobic domains in nonstructural rotavirus glycoprotein NCVP5 (8) . Cytochrome P-450 (31), another ER protein, did not display any obvious homologies in its multiple hydrophobic domains. It should be noted, however, that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, coronavirus El, and cytochrome P-450 probably interact with the lipid bilayer much more extensively than does VP7, via multiple membrane spanning domains. Since VP7 is not normally secreted, presumably there could be no specific ER receptor (14, 28) mediating its secretion, and therefore its movement along the secretory pathway in these cells is constitutive, rather than specific. This is the first demonstration of an alteration in the primary sequence which allows a naturally targeted ER molecule to be secreted, and shows unequivocally that glycoproteins can be secreted without the intervention of a specific receptor. Also of significance is that an unglycosylated, mutant VP7 is efficiently secreted. The precise reason(s) for the secretion of VP7 in the mutants 42-61, 43-61, and 47-61 is not yet clear. It could be that an anchor region has been shortened so that it no longer functions, that a positive signal for ER location has been disrupted, or that a peptidase cleavage site, e.g., the Ala-Tyr-Ala sequence at residues 66-68 (43), has been brought into proximity of the aminopeptidase used for signal peptide cleavage. These possibilities are being investigated. Our results become particularly interesting when juxtaposed with several other observations. Firstly, some normally soluble molecules of the ER (2, 5) remain in the ER, whereas soluble VP7 is secreted. Secondly, influenza neuraminidase is anchored in the membrane by an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain, but this molecule, unlike VP7, is exported to the plasma membrane (6) . From the above, we conclude that the region of the second hydrophobic domain of VP7 not only serves to anchor the protein in the membrane but may also contain the positive and specific signal for maintaining the protein in the ER.",
