            "text": "Objective: Effective airway management requires both proper technique and the appropriate devices. With the widespread implementation of advanced life-support techniques in emergency medical services (EMS), orotracheal intubation is now performed not only by professional practitioners but, in many occasions, nonprofessionals. With extensively diversified skill equipped, we tested whether the Sunscope, a patented tracheal intubation device with a digital display, is able to facilitate tracheal intubation by na\u00efve EMS personnel with various training backgrounds. Methods: We conducted a study to determine rate of success and time required to insert an orotracheal tube into a mannequin using Sunscope. The participants were placed into the professional group (i.e., anesthesiologists and emergency medical paramedics; EMT-P) or the nonprofessional group (i.e., emergency medical technicians; EMT). Intubation required three steps: equipment preparation, vocal cord exposure, and tube insertion. The time required for each step was recorded by a senior staff member, and the data were analyzed by nonparametric statistics. Results: Each consecutive step in the operating procedure was significantly shorter for the professional group in comparison with the nonprofessional group during the first trial: equipment preparation, 10.5 AE 2.1 vs. 11.9 AE 4.1 seconds; vocal cord exposure, 7.4 AE 7.7 vs. 12.2 AE 7.7 seconds; tube insertion, 8.8 AE 4.8 vs. 17.6 AE 9.4 seconds; and total time required for intubation, 26.7 AE 8.8 vs. 35.8 AE 19.6 seconds. The professional practitioners showed no significant improvement, in terms of time reduction, on the following three trials. On the other hand, the nonprofessional practitioners showed no significant differences, in terms of time required to expose the vocal cords and total operation time, following the third trial in comparison with the professional practitioners. Conclusion: Our research demonstrates that professional practitioners are able to use the Sunscope on their first attempt. Despite a lack of training in conventional endotracheal intubation, emergency medical technicians (EMT-I and -II) were able to complete intubation on their first attempt; a significant reduction in the time required to intubate was noted after repeated practice. All levels of na\u00efve EMTs were able to readily visualize the vocal cords through Sunscope and, thereby, reliably insert the endotracheal tube in less than 1 minute, regardless of their skills before testing.",

            "text": "It is often challenging for emergency medical service (EMS) practitioners to establish a secure airway for endotracheal intubation. In addition to the relative level of inexperience and work setting, conventional direct laryngoscopy is regarded as the most difficult procedure for EMS practitioners with insufficient training to perform. Inadequate training and poor equipment not only lead to malpositioning of the placed endotracheal tube but unnecessary trauma. 1 The major obstacle of direct laryngoscopy is failure to visualize the larynx because of anatomical variation and/or manipulation errors. 2, 3 In contrast, illumination on the tip of the tracheal tube with a lighted stylet (e.g., Lightwand) demonstrates a high rate of successful intubation (97.9e100%). 4, 5 However, poor illumination in association with obesity, skin pigmentation, and resistance to the advancement of the endotracheal tube all lead to intubation failure. Accordingly, a video-guided intubation system with a lighted stylet could facilitate endotracheal intubation and avoid many of the mishaps of \"blind\" intubation. 6 In addition to difficulty of intubation, the operator (and/or the supervisor) is subject to unnecessary contamination when he must position his eyes close to the patient's mouth in order to obtain an optimized view of the vocal cords. This can result in the transmission of infections, including tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hepatitis, and HIV, through contact with contagious respiratory secretions or droplets. 7 Because of this concern, the manipulators should keep themselves as far away as possible from the mouths of their patients. 8, 9 In an earlier study, we found that a visual module that is integrated with Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lights, a lens, and a Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) sensor could meet the crucial demands of both the operator and patient. 10 Sunscope, which features a detachable image probe, is an anesthesiologistinitiated innovative device invented to meet the scrutinizing demands of clinical anesthesiologists in terms of protection against infection, portability, detachability, and affordability. 11 The prototype has been successfully tested on an endotracheal intubation model and in animal trials, and it has proven its clinical capabilities for use in anesthetic practice. In this study, we went on to investigate how EMS practitioners with diverse training backgrounds performed endotracheal intubation on mannequins using Sunscope.",

One group consisted of seven professional practitioners, including physicians, nurse specialists, and emergency medical paramedics (EMT-P) who had performed over 1280 hours of training, who could perform some invasive medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation and administer drugs for resuscitation. The other group consisted of six nonprofessional practitioners, specifically emergency medical technicians (EMT) who lacked endotracheal intubation training and could only perform noninvasive airway establishment such as placing nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airways and laryngeal mask airways (LMA). The purpose of this study was to compare the times required to perform endotracheal intubation between these two groups.",

Because the anatomic structure of a mannequin is fixed, there are some differences between the model and a real human body. Furthermore, repeated practice on a mannequin will certainly improve the success rate of intubation as familiarity with its structure increases, but not necessarily when performed on a real human. Based on the above considerations, this test was performed as follows: each participant performed the intubation procedure three times on a mannequin (for 5 minutes) after the airway anatomy tutorials and operational training sessions had been provided, and each time was recorded. The time expenditure on first trial was considered the first successful intubation and procedure record, and the other trials were considered improvement records. Based on the training backgrounds of the participants, only the professional practitioners had ever performed a laryngoscopy before, and the others had only inserted oral, nasal, or laryngeal mask airways.",

This means that an adequately bent stylet helps to rapidly and properly complete vocal cord exposure step. Although the use of a readily bent stylet could sufficiently reduce the equipment preparation time, in theory, it might fail to reduce the equipment preparation time due to unanticipated difficult airways and individual variations in each person's anatomical structure, which are related to age, height, and weight. Accordingly, it is impossible to accurately predict the length of the respiratory tract using only a few parameters, and a readily bent stylet would not guarantee successful endotracheal intubation. 12 ",

In such doubtful circumstances, it is possible to cause devastating spinal injuries by performing laryngoscopy, and the lengthy intubation time required due to poor visualization of the vocal cords leads to hypoxic insults. Gastric regurgitation and the resulting chemical aspiration may occur during this procedure. Thus, tracheal intubation under direct laryngoscopy usually fails. 14 Compared with the direct laryngoscope, Sunscope is a videoassisted endoscope that is composed of a digital visual stylet that acts as a guide for introducing the tracheal tube. It can reach the trachea and complete intubation without lifting up the glossoepiglottic folds.
