Entry of coronaviruses into cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike glycoprotein S, which forms a trimer carrying receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions 1 . S also contains the principal antigenic determinants and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we present the structure of a murine coronavirus S trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with paramyxovirus F proteins 2,3 , implicating mechanistic similarities and an evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses. Finally, comparison with crystal structures of human coronavirus S domains allows rationalization of the molecular basis for species specificity based on the use of spatially contiguous but distinct domains.",

S determines host range, cell tropism and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies during infection 1 . S is a class I viral fusion protein synthesized as a single chain precursor of about 1300 amino acids which trimerizes upon folding. It is composed of an Nterminal S 1 subunit, containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and a C-terminal S 2 subunit, driving membrane fusion. Cleavage by furin-like host proteases at the junction between S 1 and S 2 (S 2 cleavage site) occurs during biogenesis for some coronaviruses such as murine hepatitis virus (MHV, the prototypical and best studied coronavirus) 1, 5 . The S 1 and S 2 subunits remain non-covalently associated in the metastable pre-fusion S trimer. Upon virion uptake by target cells, a second cleavage is mediated by endo-lysosomal proteases (S 2 ' cleavage site) allowing fusion activation of coronavirus S proteins 6 .",

The final model includes residues 15 to 1118 with an internal break corresponding to a loop immediately upstream from the S 2 ' cleavage site (residues 827-863). The region connecting the S 1 and S 2 subunits (residues 718-754) features weak density which correlates with its accessibility for proteolytic cleavage in vivo. Residues 453-535 were modeled by density-guided homology modeling using Rosetta due to the poor quality of the density in this region (ED Fig. 3k ).",

Additional contacts between the upstream and central helices participate to inter-protomer interactions. Furthermore, the S 1 subunits interlock to form a crown around the S 2 trimer stabilizing it in the pre-fusion conformation ( Fig.3c -d and Supplementary Table 3 ). This is illustrated by the large surface area buried at the interface between each S 1 subunit and the S 2 subunits of the three protomers (1,970 \u00c5 2 ). Many of these contacts involve the HR1 helices and the fusion peptide region. These polypeptide segments undergo major refolding during the fusogenic conformational changes (ED Fig.6a -e) which supports the notion that the S 1 subunits maintain the S 2 fusion machinery in its metastable state. Substitutions of the conserved alanine 994 by valine in helix \u03b1 28 or of the conserved leucine 1062 by phenylalanine in the central helix were shown to attenuate fusogenicity 21, 22 . Our structure suggests that the former substitution would strengthen hydrophobic packing against the core \u03b2-sheet (ED Fig.  7b ) and that the later substitution could reinforce molecular stapling of the central helices (ED Fig.7a,c) . The expected modification of the energy landscape between pre-fusion and post-fusion conformations would explain the reduction of fusion activity of these mutants 21, 22 .",

In the case of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus, trypsin processing at the S 2 ' site can only occur after host cell attachment 24 . This indicates that receptor binding could allosterically increase the accessibility of the S 2 ' site which is located within helix \u03b1 21 . The acidic pH of the endo-lysosomes could also contribute to exposing the S 2 ' cleavage site for coronaviruses requiring cleavage in this compartment. The fact that helix \u03b1 21 appears dynamic and is found immediately downstream from a disordered loop suggests that it could undergo considerable \"breathing\" motions. Regardless of the mechanism promoting cleavage, the MHV S structure reported here explains the requirement for processing at the S 2 ' site, as it frees the fusion peptide from the S 2 N-terminal region which is a prerequisite for its insertion ~200 \u00c5 away in the target membrane.

For large-scale production of MHV S ectodomain the cells were cultured in spinner flasks and induced by 5 \u03bcM of CdCl 2 at a density of approximately 10 7 cells per mL. After a week at 28 \u00b0C clarified cell supernatants were concentrated 40-fold using Vivaflow tangential filtration cassettes (Sartorius, 10 kDa cutoff) and adjusted to pH 8.0, before affinity purification using StrepTactin Superflow column (IBA) followed by gel filtration chromatography using Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Life Sciences) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl.

The parameters of the microscope contrast transfer function were estimated for each micrograph using ctffind3 37 . Micrographs were manually masked using Appion to exclude the visible carbon supporting film for further processing. Particles were automatically picked in a reference-free manner using DogPicker 38 . Extraction of particle images was performed using Relion 1.4 with a box size of 320 pixels 2 and applying a windowing operation in Fourier space to yield a final box size of 288 pixels 2 (corresponding to a pixel size of 1.46 \u00c5). From the 1.2 million particles initially picked, a subset of 50,000 particles were randomly selected to generate class averages using RELION 39 . An initial 3D model was generated using OPTIMOD 40 within the Appion pipeline. The entire data set was subjected to 2D alignment and clustering using RELION and particles belonging to the best-defined class averages were retained (~500,000 particles). These ~500,000 particles were then subjected to RELION 3D classification with 4 classes (using c1 symmetry) starting with our initial model low-pass filtered to 40\u00c5 resolution. We subsequently used the ~230,000 best particles (selected from the 3D classification) and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) to run Relion 3D auto-refine (c3 symmetry) which led to a reconstruction at 4.4 \u00c5 resolution. We utilized the particle polishing procedure in RELION 1.4 to correct for individual particle movement and radiation damage 41, 42 . A second round of 3D classification with 6 classes (c3 symmetry) was performed using the polished particles resulting in the selection of 82,000 particles. A new 3D auto-refine run (c3 symmetry) using the selected 82,000 particles and the map corresponding to the best 3D class (low-pass filtered at 40 \u00c5 resolution) yielded a map at 4.0 \u00c5 resolution following post processing in RELION. The final map was sharpened with an empirically determined B factor of \u2212220 \u00c5 2 using Relion post processing. Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard FSC=0.143 criterion 43 and Fourier shell correction curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution 44 . The soft mask used for FSC calculation had a 10 pixel cosine edge fall-off. The overall shape and dimensions of our reconstruction agree with previous data although the HR2 stem connecting to the membrane is not resolved 15 .",

Next, the MERS-CoV domain B crystal structure (PDB 4KQZ) was also fit into the density, and rebuilt and refined using RosettaCM 47 . Although we could accurately align the sequences corresponding to the core \u03b2-sheet of the MHV and MERS-CoV B domains, the ~100 residues forming the \u03b2-motif extension (residues 453-535, MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV receptor-binding moiety) could not be aligned with confidence. We used RosettaCM to build models of each of the 945 possible disulfide patterns into the density for domain B. For each disulfide arrangement, 50 models were generated, and there was a very clear energy signal for a single such arrangement (ED Fig.3k) . Then, 1000 models with this disulfide arrangement were sampled, and the lowest energy model (using the Rosetta force field augmented with a fit-to-density score term) was selected. Due to the poor quality of the reconstruction at the apex of the S trimer, the confidence of the model is lowest for the segment corresponding to residues 453-535, as homology-modeling was used to fill in details missing in the map.",

Rosetta de novo successfully identified fragments allowing to anchor the sequence register for domains C and D as well as for helices \u03b1 21 -\u03b1 25 . Given these anchoring positions, RosettaCM 47 augmented with a novel density-guided model-growing protocol was able to rebuild domains C and D in full. The final model was refined by applying strict non-crystallographic symmetry constraints using Rosetta 19 . Model refinement was performed using a training map corresponding to one of the two maps generated by the gold-standard refinement procedure in Relion.

The density was too weak to allow tracing of this segment (residues 453-535) which has been traced by density-guided homology modeling using Rosetta. c-d, Ribbon diagrams of the S 1 trimer viewed from the side (c) and from the top (looking toward the viral membrane, d).Extended Data Figure 6. Mechanisms of membrane fusion promoted by coronavirus S glycoproteins a, Ribbon diagram of the MHV S 2 pre-fusion structure. Disulfide bonds are shown as green sticks. b, Topology diagram of the MHV S 2 pre-fusion structure. FP: fusion peptide. PP: diproline that will act as helix breaker. The presence of these di-proline motifs indicates the post-fusion HR1 coiled-coil could not extend up to the fusion peptide as a single helix. This hypothesis is further supported by the observation of a conserved disulfide bond formed between residues Cys894 and Cys905 (labeled 14 in (a) and (b)), which will prevent refolding of helices \u03b1 22 and \u03b1 23 as a single extended helix. c, Ribbon diagram of the SARS-CoV postfusion HR1 helix obtained by X-ray crystallography (PDB 1WYY). The residue numbers corresponding to the MHV A59 sequence are indicated. d, Topology diagram showing the expected coronavirus S post-fusion conformation derived from our MHV S structure and the SARS-CoV post-fusion core crystal structure shown in (c). e, Ribbon diagram of a model of the MHV S 2 post-fusion conformation.
