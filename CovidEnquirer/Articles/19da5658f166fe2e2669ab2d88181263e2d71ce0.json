            "text": "Poultry production is an important economic activity on inhabited islands of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago. There has been a recent surge in both small-scale backyard chickens and larger scale broiler production associated with growth in the human population and the tourist industry. With increased poultry production, concerns have been expressed about the increasing risk of transfer of disease from chickens to native Gal\u00e1pagos bird species that may have little resistance to introduced pathogens [Wikelski, M., Foufopoulos, J., Vargas, H., Snell, H., 2004. Gal\u00e1pagos birds and diseases: invasive pathogens as threats for island species. Ecology and Society 9(5). Available from: URL:http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss1/art5]. This study evaluates risks posed by chicken disease to endemic and native Gal\u00e1pagos bird species, based on empirical evidence of pathogens present in chickens on the islands and a literature review of eVects of these pathogens in wild species. Pathogens identiWed in domestic chicken populations of immediate avian conservation concern are Newcastle disease, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and the proventricular parasite Dispharynx sp. Newcastle disease (avian paramyxovirus-1) poses an imminent threat to Gal\u00e1pagos penguins (Spheniscus mendiculus), Xightless cormorants (Phalacrocorax harrisi), and lava gulls (Larus fuliginosus), species with very small population sizes (less than 1500 animals each). Additionally, litter from broiler farms could aVect ecological processes in local ecosystems. Improved poultry biosecurity measures are urgently needed on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands for avian disease management, yet developing these strategies presents political, social, and economic challenges. \uf6d9",

From the 19th century to the present, human activities, including the introduction of invasive animal and plant species, have negatively impacted Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystems (Snell et al., 2002; MacFarland and Cifuentes, 1996) . In other island ecosystems, such as Hawaii, anthropogenic introduction of exotic vertebrate and invertebrate species is linked to the emergence of infectious disease (e.g., avian malaria and avian pox) and subsequent decline in many native bird species (Van Riper III et al., 1986; Atkinson et al., 1995) .",

Domestic chickens are present on Santa Cruz, Isabela, San Cristobal, Floreana, and Baltra ( Fig. 1 ). Three types of poultry farming are practiced on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands: smallscale backyard meat chickens (1-40 birds per farm) (Fig. 2) , small to medium-scale egg layers, and medium to relatively large-scale commercial broiler operations (2000-4000 birds) (Fig. 3) . Currently, there are 23 broiler chicken farms on Santa Cruz, 6 on San Cristobal, and 4 on Isabela. In the past Wve to ten years, poultry production has intensiWed due to demand from the growing human population and tourist industry. Under Gal\u00e1pagos law, broiler chickens, brought to Gal\u00e1pagos at 1-5 days of age, must be unvaccinated and certiWed as healthy by approved aviculture facilities on the Ecuadorian mainland. Currently, no livestock vaccinations are permitted on the Galapagos Islands (David Cruz, SIC-GAL, personal communication). Feral populations of chickens exist on Santa Cruz, Isabela, San Cristobal, and Floreana. In addition to the risk of introducing disease into native Galapagos avifauna, waste from domestic poultry operations may have detrimental eVects on local plant and animal communities in the Galapagos due to nutrient enrichment and water contamination. In 2001, the Saint Louis Zoo and the University of Missouri -St. Louis, in cooperation with the Gal\u00e1pagos National Park Service and the Charles Darwin Research Station, initiated an avian disease surveillance program in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. This monitoring serves to identify pathogens that pose a particular risk to native populations and helps to target certain pathogens for future disease surveillance. A similar approach to identifying high-risk pathogens has been performed for killer whales (Orcinus orca) (Gaydos et al., 2004) . Here, we present results of poultry disease surveys from 2001 to 2003 in relation to their threat to native birds, discuss ecological threats of broiler aviculture and backyard chickens to Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystems, identify disease research priorities, and discuss potential strategies for the control and prevention of disease transmission to native birds.",

The 100 birds collected for the necropsy workshops were euthanized humanely by intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium euthanasia solution (Beuthanasia-D Special, Schering Plough Animal Health Corporation, Union, NJ 07083, USA). Complete post-mortem examinations (gross and microscopic examination) were performed on all birds except those from the November 2003 collections in San Cristobal, where only serum was taken. Representative samples of major organs were Wxed in 10% neutral buVered formalin (Wxed tissue samples were transferred to ethanol to facilitate international transportation). Tissues were routinely processed for light microscopic histopathology (hematoxylin and eosin staining) at the Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, Columbia, MO 65205, USA. Subsequent samples were routinely processed at AXXIS and Astrid Rhon laboratories, Quito, Ecuador. Tissues from each bird were examined by a veterinary pathologist (T.W., N.G.) for microscopic lesions. In one bird, further par-aYn sections were evaluated for Toxoplasma gondii antigen using polyclonal antibody 125P (GioGenex, San Ramon, CA 94583) and streptavidin, and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) chromagen detection. Appropriate positive and negative controls were run simultaneously. Helminths and ectoparasites retrieved during necropsy were placed in 10% formalin and transferred to absolute ethanol or placed directly in ethanol for examination. Preserved specimens were identiWed by a parasitologist (M. Dailey). In some cases, parasites were only present in histologic sections and they were identiWed as morphological features allowed. Therefore, sample sizes for evaluation of prevalence of particular parasites diVered between parasites.",

A large proportion of chickens from pooled samples from July 2001 to November 2003 were seroreactive for avian adenovirus I (81%), infectious bronchitis virus (41%), infectious tenosynovitis virus (51%), Marek's disease (43%), avian encephalomyelitis (42%), and infectious bursal disease (40%). In Argentina, adenovirus antibody prevalence similar to that in our study was associated with poor hygienic conditions on commercial poultry farms (Gonzalez et al., 1978) . The seroprevalence for infectious bronchitis virus in our study resembled that in backyard poultry operations in villages of the Yucatan Peninsula (56%) and may be a common cause of respiratory disease in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens as well (Gutierrez-Ruiz et al., 2000) . Comparable serologic results were also seen for Avian encephalomyelitis presence in fancy chickens from Switzerland. In this study, relatively high pathogen prevalence was associated with close contact and group rearing of similar chicken age classes (Wunderwald and Hoop, 2002) .",

In 1992 and 2000, disease outbreaks attributed to velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease caused the death of over 2000 and 500 chickens, respectively, on Santa Cruz Island. Disease eradication plans were implemented by selective culling (Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganader\u00eda, Direcci\u00f3n Provincial Agropecuaria de Gal\u00e1pagos). However, antibodies to Newcastle disease were not detected in Santa Cruz chickens tested in our study. Explanations for this Wnding include potential false negative serotests, low sample size, and local eradication of disease during the outbreak of 1999-2000. Newcastle disease antibodies were detected in broiler chickens from San Cristobal in November 2003 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although the chickens tested appeared relatively normal, necropsy Wndings on abbatoir chickens from the seropositive Xock are consistent with a Newcastle disease strain of low to moderate pathogenicity. Potential sources of Newcastle disease virus are domestic pigeons (Alexander, 2003) , contaminated equipment (Alexander, 1988) , illegal transport of cock-Wghting birds between islands, migratory birds, or introduction of infected birds or poultry products from the Ecuadorian mainland.",

            "text": "Serologic results indicate that poultry on both Santa Cruz and San Cristobal Islands have been exposed to infectious bursal disease (IBD). IBD is a Birnavirus that causes necrosis of the lymphoid tissues (Sivanandan and Maheswaran, 1980; Lukert and Saif, 2003) resulting in immunosuppression that allows the emergence of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections (Charlton, 2000) . Relatively high antibody titers to IBD were detected in herring gulls in the Baltic Sea (Hollmen et al., 2000) and free-ranging Antarctic penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae and Aptenodyes forsteri) (Gardner et al., 1997) . It remains unknown whether IBD is pathogenic to endemic birds such as lava gulls (L. fuliginosus) and Gal\u00e1pagos penguins (S. mendiculus). Regardless, a very pathogenic strain of IBD has recently invaded South America (Enzo and Yannick, 2003) . If introduced to Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, this strain may cause proliferation of a variety of pathogens in domestic Xocks that may spillover into wild bird populations. Furthermore, penguins and Xightless cormorants may have contact with infected chicken products via increasing tourist and Wshing activities in Western Gal\u00e1pagos and local migrants such as yellow warblers that may carry the disease from inhabited to uninhabited regions. Diseases such as infectious bursal disease as reported in Antarctic penguins (Gardner et al., 1997) could be transmitted to these populations by contact with chicken waste.",

It is also diYcult and expensive to monitor the certiWed aviculture companies on the Ecuadorian mainland for diseases that pose a threat to wild birds. Implementation of biosecurity protocols in broiler facilities that minimize contact with wild birds is relatively straightforward. Unfortunately, many broiler houses on the Gal\u00e1pagos do not follow strict biosecurity protocols and have inadequate broiler house construction, allowing for direct contact between some native bird species. Unlike backyard chickens living in relatively low densities, high densities in broiler farms may increase contact rates between infected individuals and provide a highly concentrated pathogen source, facilitating disease spread to wild birds and backyard chickens. Additionally, high concentrations of poultry in broiler houses may provide an ideal opportunity for recombination to occur between strains of a pathogen, potentially resulting in the emergence of a pathogen with increased virulence for other avian species.",

Higher soil nitrogen levels may facilitate the growth of detrimental invasive species present in the Gal\u00e1pagos, such as blackberry (Rubus sp.). Additionally, a change in plant species composition or vegetation structure may also alter avian bird community composition (Wilson and Belcher, 1989) and nesting success (Remes, 2003) .

For example, Newcastle disease, historically and serologically present in Gal\u00e1pagos chickens, may cause high poultry mortality and decline or extinction in endangered native birds, such as the Xightless cormorant. A policy decision needs to be made whether to eradicate or control Newcastle disease on the Gal\u00e1pagos. Vaccination of poultry Xocks is controversial, because animal vaccination is prohibited in the Gal\u00e1pagos. Vaccines can control, but not eradicate Newcastle disease, and could result in transfer of Newcastle disease to wild bird species if modiWed-live or live vaccines are used. From the perspective of wild bird conservation, Newcastle disease eradication would be the best management strategy. Test and slaughter programs in order to eradicate Newcastle disease in Gal\u00e1pagos poultry should be considered. However, eradication strategies are politically and economically diYcult because funds are needed to compensate farmers for the deaths of birds that test positive. Furthermore, disease eradication strategies have the potential to cause the avicultural sector to mistrust local disease control programs, hindering further disease reporting, investigation, and control. Before eradication plans are implemented, the strains, pathogenicity, and possible origins of Newcastle disease present in Gal\u00e1pagos poultry should be identiWed, and poultry producers must be educated regarding disease control strategies. In order to better evaluate the pathogenicity of disease on endemic Gal\u00e1pagos avifauna, ex situ experimental infection of endemic birds (e.g., ground Wnches) with pathogens isolated from Gal\u00e1pagos chickens would be ideal, but small population sizes preclude disease transmission studies in endemics such as the mangrove Wnch, medium tree Wnch, Xightless cormorant, and Gal\u00e1pagos penguin.",

A contingency plan that will enable rapid response for the successful mitigation of disease outbreaks of Gal\u00e1pagos native birds and poultry is necessary and urgent. Such a plan should identify national and international collaborators and laboratories for diagnosis of pathogens, budget costs, establish operational agreements, and maintain permits to facilitate the action plan when abnormal mortality of native birds or poultry is encountered.",
