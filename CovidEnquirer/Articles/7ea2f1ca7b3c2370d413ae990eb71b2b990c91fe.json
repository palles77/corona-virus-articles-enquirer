Tolerance at supra-MIC 26 antifungal drug concentrations is rarely quantified and current clinical recommendations suggest 27 it be ignored. Here, we measured and characterized drug-response variables that could 28 influence the outcomes of fungal infections and be generalizable across major clades of 29 Candida albicans, one of the most frequently isolated human fungal pathogens. We quantified 30 antifungal tolerance as the fraction of growth (FoG) above the MIC and found that it is clearly 31 distinct from susceptibility/resistance measured as MIC. Instead, tolerance is due to the slow 32 growth of subpopulations of cells that overcome drug stress more efficiently than the rest of the 33 population, and correlates inversely with the accumulation of intracellular drug. Importantly, 34 many adjuvant drugs used together with fluconazole, a fungistatic drug, reduce tolerance 35 without affecting resistance. These include inhibitors of major stress response hubs such as 36 Hsp90, calcineurin, PKC1 and TOR. Accordingly, in an invertebrate infection model, adjuvant 37 combination therapy was significantly more effective than fluconazole alone in treating highly 38 tolerant isolates and did not improve the treatment of isolates with low tolerance levels.",

Some infections are recalcitrant to drug treatment due to 'resistance', which 52 refers to microbial growth in the presence of drug concentrations that inhibit susceptible 53 isolates 1,2 . Susceptibility is commonly measured as the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) 54 after 24 h of growth in the presence of drug 3,4 . Fungal infections generally follow the \"90/60\" rule 55 for predicting therapeutic outcomes based on in vitro susceptibility testing: ~90% of susceptible 56 isolates and 60% of resistant isolates respond to therapy 5-9 . This implies that infection 57 outcomes are influenced by host factors as well as features of the pathogen that are not 58 reflected by the MIC 10,11 . In effect, organisms that cause persistent infections, defined as those 59 that are not cleared by a course of antifungal treatment, have similar susceptibilities to 60 organisms that are readily cleared by a course of antifungal treatment 12 .

Mechanisms underlying persistent candidemia may include variability 77 in the pharmacology of the drug, suboptimal dosing, presence of fungal biofilms on indwelling 78 catheters, and reduced immunity. We posit that some responses to the drug are not captured 79 by measuring the MIC alone and that additional parameters could be used to predict the 80 likelihood that a clinical isolate might respond poorly to antifungal drugs. Furthermore, 81 understanding the mechanisms that underlie these parameters is critical for the development of 82 new therapeutic approaches against persistent Candida infections. 83 MIC measurements have been optimized to minimize or ignore residual fungal 84 growth 9,34,35 , termed 'tolerance' or 'trailing growth', which has been discussed in the literature for 85 over 20 years 36,37 and is detected in 25-60% of clinical isolates 4,10,19,38-44 . This recommendation 86 is based upon studies of acute infections using the mouse model of bloodstream candidiasis 45-87 47 , and the observation that isolates with high trailing growth in mucosal infections respond 88 positively to short term antifungal treatment, despite later recurrence of infection 48 . Trailing 89 growth is sensitive to environmental conditions, including pH, temperature and nutrients 3,49,50 90 and is usually detected in liquid cultures. Definitions of 'tolerance' vary and generally describe 91 survival or growth above inhibitory concentrations 2,10,28,38,51-56 , detected as slow growth within 92 the zone of inhibition using E-strips or disk diffusion assays 57,58 , or in broth microdilution 93 assays 38,39 . Tolerance can be affected by several adjuvant drugs 19-24 , iron levels 19,59 , genes 94 involved in vacuolar protein sorting 38,47 , as well as calcium flux 28,55,59-61 . However, the precise 95 relationship between the outcome of fungal infections and tolerance or trailing growth has not 96 been determined. Because tolerant cells continue to divide in the presence of antifungals, we 97 postulated that they contribute to the persistence and/or recurrence of fungal infections.",

In general, the rate of R6G efflux was higher in the presence, than 217 in the absence, of FLC, with SC5314 as the notable exception ( Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig.   218   6a ). Yet, efflux rates did not correlate with FoG under any of the conditions tested 219 ( Supplementary Fig. 6b , R 2 < 0.2). Thus, the determinants of steady state intracellular FLC 220 levels are complex, and include uptake and efflux rates as well as other factors (Fig. 3g ).",

The growth properties of cells 359 at supra-MIC concentrations measured here with FLC, a fungistatic drug, contrast with those antibacterial tolerance in bactericidal drugs. This likely reflects distinct modes of 361 action between static and cidal drugs as well as different molecular mechanisms of stress 362 responses in eukaryotes and bacteria. Antibacterial tolerance generally involves a longer lag 363 phase for the majority of the population 75-77 . By contrast, antifungal tolerance involves the earlier 364 appearance of a subpopulation of cells that continue to grow in the presence of drug and, unlike 365 'phenotypic resistance' described for bacteria 127 , is not dependent upon growth phase or implications. This study revisited the question of whether supra-MIC growth is 369 clinically relevant and, by inference, whether the stress pathways that mediate it represent 370 important drug targets. Previous work suggested that trailing growth was not important for 371 virulence in either mouse models 45,46 or infection outcomes in the human host 48 . However, these 372 studies analyzed short-term responses, rather than persistence or recurrence of Candida 373 infection over longer time frames. Here, both in vivo and clinical studies provide a proof of 374 principle suggesting that retrospective and prospective clinical studies that measure tolerance 375 are warranted. We posit that monitoring FoG/SMG in standard clinical assays may have 376 prognostic value for the likelihood of a persistent infection, for the responsiveness of a given 377 isolate to FLC, as well as for the synergism of an adjuvant drug with FLC. Furthermore, in 378 developing countries where azoles remain the major antifungals in use, measuring tolerance 379 may be especially relevant and the addition of low cost adjuvant drugs could significantly impact 380 treatment outcomes (e.g., 128 ).

Consistent with this, the effects of temperature and Hsp90 inhibitors 240 correlated well with FoG (R 2 = 0.93, Supplementary Fig. 7e) and only partially with RAD (R 2 = -241 0.61,Supplementary Fig. 7f). Thus, temperature inhibition of Hsp90 affects tolerance and not 242 resistance per se. Furthermore, FoG levels were not affected by Hsp90 steady state protein 243 levels, as the amount of Hsp90 did not correlate with FoG (R 2 = 0.07,Supplementary Fig. 7g).Because inhibitors of calcineurin and Hsp90 are known to affect FLC cidality 15,24,27,61,67,88,99,100 , we asked whether other adjuvant drugs have a similar effect.
