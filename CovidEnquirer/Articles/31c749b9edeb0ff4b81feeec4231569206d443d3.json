Based on internal amino acid sequence analysis and different mobilities obtained with non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 106 kDa aminopeptidase is distinct from a previously described 115 kDa CryIAc-binding aminopeptidase. The 106 kDa protein was preferentially precipitated by CrylC relative to CryIAc toxin. The 106 kDa form, like the 115 kDa aminopeptidase, has a cross-reacting determinant typical of a cleaved glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. On ligand blots, CryIAc recognized membrane bound 120 and soluble 115 kDa aminopeptidases, but not the soluble 106 kDa form. The results show that CryIC and CryIAc 6endotoxins recognize functionally related, but structurally distinct 106 kDa and 115 kDa isoforms of aminopeptidase in the M. sexta midgut.",

CryIC has high activity against Spodoptera species, which are relatively resistant to CryIA toxins. CryIC remains active against several insect species that have acquired resistance to CryIA toxins (Ferre et al., 1991; Tabashnik et al., 1994) . CryIC is released from B. thuringiensis crystals as a 135 kDa protoxin and cleaved to an active 62 kDa toxin in the alkaline insect midgut. Insecticidal activity is caused by toxin binding to midgut brush border membranes, then toxin integration into the membrane leading to pore formation, cell lysis and insect mortality (reviewed in Gill et al., 1992; Knowles and Dow, 1993) .",

For example, CrylAc resistant insect species (Plodia interpunctella and Plutella o'lostella) still bind and are killed by CrylC toxin. Several CrylC binding proteins have been described. Oddou et al. (1993) showed that CrylC toxin binds to a 40 kDa protein on ligand blots of brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from three Spodoptera species. Sanchis and Ellar (1993) observed CrylC binding to 40 and 110 kDa proteins in S. littoralis midgut BBMV using a combination of toxinaffinity selection and ligand blotting. CrylAb and CrylAc binding proteins have been identified in Manduca sexta (Vadlamudi et al., 1993; Sangadala et al., 1994; Knight et al., 1994) . The CrylAb binding protein is a 210 kDa cadherin-like glycoprotein (Vadlamudi et al., 1995) , whereas the CrylAc binding protein is a 120 kDa aminopeptidase N (APN) (Sangadala et al., 1994; Knight et al., 1994) . Recently, Knight et al. (1995) cloned a M. sexta aminopeptidase that may encode the CrylAc receptor. To date the only functional evidence that aminopeptidase is a toxin receptor comes from Sangadala et al. (1994) who reconstituted a mixture of 120 kDa APN and a 65 kDa protein into membrane vesicles and measured a 30% increase in CrylAc binding and a 1000-fold decrease in the amount 784 KE LUO et al. of CrylAc toxin required to induce 86Rb+ efflux. The binding characteristics of CryIA toxins to the 115 kDa soluble form of the CryIAc receptor were determined using plasmon resonance spectroscopy (Masson et aI., 1995) . CryIAc binds at two sites, CryIAb and CryIAa recognize one site and CryIC does not bind to the 115 kDa molecule.",

In bovine renal BBMV, APN appears to be associated with Na+-dependent amino acid co-transport (Plakidou-Dymock et al., 1993) . The enzyme is found in both soluble and membrane-bound ectoenzyme forms. The ectoenzyme form is attached to the intestinal brush border cells of many animals by a hydrophobic N-terminal stalk (Kenny et al., 1987; Takasaki et al., 1991) . In insects, however, attachment is via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Tomita et al., 1994; Garczynski and Adang, 1995) . This observation agrees with the predicted amino acid sequence of the cloned aminopeptidase which has a typical carboxy terminal signal for attachment of the GPI anchor (Knight et al., 1995) . M. sexta brush border cells have a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) which can cleave the lipid anchor from the 120 kDa CryIAc-binding APN, releasing a 115 kDa form (Lu and Adang, 1996) .",

CHAPS-solubilized BBMV were applied to the CryIC affinity column, and bound proteins were eluted with 1 M NaSCN. Fig. 1 (Lane 5) shows a 106 kDa protein that was present in the eluate. A considerable amount of 106 kDa protein was also visible in Lane 4 (not bound). The purification of a 106 kDa protein was not expected, based on previous studies identifying a 40 kDa CryIC binding protein in several insect species. CryIC toxin from the column and a slight amount of a 115 kDa protein were also present in the eluate. Our previous experience in purifying the 115 kDa CrylAc binding protein suggested that conventional chromatography can be more efficient than CryIC affinity columns (Lu and Adang, 1996) . We developed an alternative method combining heat treatment and conventional chromatographies to isolate the 106 kDa protein. Solubilized BBMV were passed through a DE 52 column at pH 5.5, a condition where most proteins, but not the 106 kDa protein, bound to the column [ Fig. I(B) , Lane 3]. Since Hajjou and Le Gal (1994) and Klinkowstrom et al. (1994) reported aminopeptidase was heat stable at, 50-60\u00b0C, we included a 60\u00b0C treatment of the DE 52 column flow-through that eliminated most background BBMV proteins [ Fig. I(B) , Lane 3]. The original stained gel showed the contaminating proteins more clearly. After a second ion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q) at pH 8.0, we obtained a 106 kDa protein visible as a single band on SDS-PAGE [ Fig. I(B) , Lane 2].",

The sequencing result was confirmed by testing for aminopeptidase activity.

The APN activity of the 106 kDa protein was inhibited by amastatin and EDTA. Garczynski and Adang (1995) demonstrated that the 120 kDa CryIAc-binding APN has an intact C-terminal GPI anchor. In the 115 kDa APN, this GPI anchor was cleaved. The 106 kDa APN was tested for a GPI anchor by probing a filter blot of PIPLC-treated and untreated 106 kDa APN with anti-CRD antibody. Anti-CRD antibody detects the modified inositol product generated by PIPLC cleavage. As shown in Fig. 4 , both PIPLC-treated and untreated 106 kDa APN reacted with the anti-CRD antibody [ Fig. 4(B) , Lane 2], indicating that 106 kDa APN has a GPI anchor and the anchor has been precleaved.",

We tested the same amounts of CryIAc toxin with the three APNs and detected enhancement of 115 kDa APN activity as reported previously (Sangadala et al., 1994) . There was some enhancement of 106 kDa APN activity by CryIAc. The effect of BSA was negligible relative to the stimulatory effects of CryIC on 106 kDa APN and CryIAc on 115 kDa APN activity. effect on CrylC toxin binding. CrylC toxin enhances enzyme activity in the nanomolar toxin range. The 106 kDa APN was also shown to have a cleaved GPI anchor. Previous studies showed that CrylC recognized a 40 kDa protein in three Spodoptera species and Heliothis virescens (Oddou et al., 1993; Sanchis and Ellar, 1993) . The difference between our results and prior studies may be due to several factors. (A) CrylC binding proteins may differ between insect species. (B) Previous investigations of CrylC binding studies were based on ligand blotting. We were unsuccessful using this technique either with ~25 I-labeled CrylC toxin or anti-CrylC antibody detection.

            "text": "APN is an exopeptidase which preferentially cleaves peptides with N-terminal neutral amino acids (Kenny et al. , 1987) . The N-termini of most activated CryI toxins are neutral amino acids such as leucine and isoleucine (Hofte and Whiteley, 1989; Luo and Adang, unpublished data) . One possibility is that APN binding to CryI toxins may be a consequence of the enzyme's N-terminal trimming reaction following endoprotease cleavage. Sangadala et al. (1994) and Knight et al. (1994) argued against this model and proposed that CrylAc toxin binds elsewhere on the APN. In this study, we showed that amastatin, a competitive active-site inhibitor, did not block CrylC binding to 106 kDa APN (Fig. 6) , suggesting that the toxin does not bind to the active site. A more complicated explanation of the amastatin experiment involves a consideration of how toxin binding activates APN. CrylC and CrylAc binding to 106 kDa and 115 kDa APN molecules enhanced enzymatic activity against LpNA (Fig.  7) . This agrees with our previous study of CrylAc and 120 kDa APN (Sangadala et al., 1994) . Toxin-induced enzyme enhancement may be analogous to the effect cer-tain peptide inhibitors have on microsomal aminopeptidase. Certain analogs of APN inhibitors stimulate rather than decrease enzymatic activity (Taylor, 1993) . DiGregorio et al. (1988) explains this unexpected activation as due to the existence of two substrate binding sites in close proximity on APN. Cryl toxin binding to APN may alter the fit of LpNA into the active site. This could be due to binding of the toxin's N-terminus at an active site or near the active site. Similarly, a swine-specific coronavirus uses intestinal APN as an adventitious receptor without involving the enzyme's active site (Delmas et al., 1994) . GalNAc is part of the structure on the 120/115 kDa APN recognized by CryIAc toxin (Garczynski et al., 1991; Knowles et al., 1991; Lu and Adang, 1996) , but this amino sugar is not involved in CryIC binding to the 106 kDa protein [ Fig. 6(A) ]. This result is similar to those obtained by Masson et al. (1995) showing that Gal-NAc blocks CryIAc, but not CrylAa and CryIAb binding to 115 kDa APN. CryIC may interact with an unidentified sugar residue on 106 kDa APN, based on a recent paper by Shimizu et al. (1994) . The authors proposed that the unusual 'Greek key' structure of CryIIIA domain II (Li et al., 1991) is folded like vitelline membrane protein I from hens' eggs. This unusual folding pattern is also present in CryIAa toxin and probably a conserved topology of CryI toxins (Grochulski et al., 1995) . Vitelline membrane protein I reportedly can bind epithelial cells and has oligosaccharide transferase activity (Shimizu et al., 1994) .",

Since the 106 kDa form has a cleaved GPI anchor, M. sexta PIPLC is also acting on the membrane-bound form of the 106 kDa APN. We have not yet determined the molecular size of the 106 kDa APN with the intact GPI anchor.",

Common features included: the similarity of their N-termini; both APN forms are attached to the membrane via a GPI anchor, and both forms have high LpNA activity (48.6 /xmol/min/mg for the 106 kDa APN compared to 70.4 p~mol/min/mg for 115 kDa APN). Toxin binding is the obvious distinguishing feature: 106 kDa APN binds CryIC and not CryIAc, while the 115 kDa APN binds CryIAc and not CryIC. Also, their migrations are slightly distinguishable by SDS-PAGE. However, non-denaturing PAGE revealed distinct mobilities for the 115 and 106 kDa APNs (Fig. 5) . The internal sequence for the 106 kDa protein was not present in a published APN sequence (Knight et al., 1995) . Based on these data, we conclude that the 106 and 115 kDa proteins are isoforms of APN. Multiple aminopeptidase isoforms in insects have been described (Klinkowstrom et al., 1994; Ferreira et al., 1994) , but these proteins have not been isolated or characterized in detail.",

The diversity of alkaline phosphatases in rats arises from two genes for individual isozymes being differentially regulated in intestinal tissue (Engle and Alpers, 1992) and expressed as membranebound forms attached via a GPI linkage (Engle et al., 1995) . Another factor in isozyme diversity is that the native translation products of two genes can be similar in molecular size, but due to slight differences in amino acid sequence, the proteins are glycosylated in dramatically different ways (Engle et al., 1995) . In the case of M. sexta, we favor a hypothesis that two mRNA encode the related APN molecules, based on the peptide sequence from the 106 kDa protein not being present in the published sequence. This conclusion is also supported by the physical properties (including different heat stability and mobility on non-denaturing PAGE) of the 106 and 115 kDa proteins.",
