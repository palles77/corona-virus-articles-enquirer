It consists of cardiac muscle cells (cardiac myocytes [also known as cardiac rhabdomyocytes] or cardiomyocytes) arranged in overlapping spiral patterns. These sheets of cells are anchored to the fibrous skeleton of the heart, which surrounds the atrioventricular valves and the origins of the aorta and pulmonary artery. The myocardial thickness is related to the pressure present in each chamber; thus the atria are thin walled and the ventricles are thicker. In adult animals, the thickness of the left ventricular free wall is approximately threefold that of the right ventricle, measured in a transverse section across the middle of the ventricles, because the pressure is greater in the systemic circulation than in the pulmonary circuit.",

The arteries course over the heart in the subepicardium and give off perforating intramyocardial arteries that supply a rich capillary bed throughout the myocardium. Extensive anastomoses occur between the capillaries that tend to run parallel to the elongated cardiac muscle cells. The ratio of the area of capillaries to that of muscle cells is approximately 1 : 1, a fact evident when the myocardium is viewed histologically in cross section. Cardiac myocytes are dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy requirements. This requires a constant supply of oxygen delivered by coronary arteries.",

Mechanical pumping is composed of sequential contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole) that must be preceded by an electrophysiologic process that triggers a coordinated chronologic sequence of electrical events that result in muscle contractions. This electrophysiologic process is made possible by a network of 561.e2 interventricular septum, and (3) the right and left bundle branches that descend on each side of the muscular interventricular septum and eventually ramify in the ventricular myocardium as the Purkinje fiber network. The major pacemaker of the cardiac conduction system is the SAN. This disk-shaped structure lies between the wall of the cranial vena cava and the external wall of the right auricular appendage. Four internodal pathways connect the SAN with the AVN. The AVN is present in the wall of the right atrium dorsal to the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve. For the atria to be electrically insulated from the ventricles so that an unwarranted ectopic conduction wave will not activate the ventricles (or vice versa) and disrupt the synchronous events of the cardiac cycle, a fibrous cardiac skeleton composed of a layer of dense collagen (central fibrous body [CFB] ), as well as occasional plates of chondroid and osseous metaplasia, separates the atrial from the ventricular myocardium. This skeleton forms two fibrous rings around the AV orifices and the aortic and pulmonic orifices. Conduction fibers arising from the AVN, known as the bundle of His or AV bundle, pierce through the CFB into the ventricles and continue along the subendocardium of the interventricular septum. The AV bundle then splits into the right and left bundle branches, which further split and ramify into many other smaller branches that blend into the ventricular myocardium. Purkinje fibers constitute the AV bundle and downstream conduction pathways.",

As this transient permeability is lost, membranal potassium channels open, and rapid outward potassium flux results in myofiber membranal hyperpolarization (along with sodium and calcium efflux), ultimately bringing the membrane potential back to a \"normal\" steady state (resting potential). During this period of time (refractory period), the myocyte cannot depolarize again because of a special conformation of membrane sodium channels that is transiently lost with depolarization and regained only with hyperpolarization. Intrinsically, the resting membrane potential of pacemaker cells is more positive than that of contracting cardiomyocytes and slightly more negative than the membrane threshold potential. This difference is due to leakiness of the pacemaker cell membrane to sodium and calcium ions and a steady low-grade influx of these ions.",

The number of gap junctions between cells of the conduction system is therefore a property that affects conduction velocity. Because the heart cycle must be strictly coordinated so that both atria and both ventricles contract and relax at the same time, and atrial contraction occurs simultaneous to the late ventricular relaxation, the depolarization wave has to be conducted fast at certain points along the conduction pathway and slower at others.

Aortic input impedance best describes the opposition that the ventricle encounters at the time of ejection.

With a sustained pressure overload, the ventricular muscle adapts by undergoing concentric hypertrophy, which leads to an increase in wall thickness at the expense of a decrease in chamber size (decrease in ventricular radius), thus returning ventricular wall stress toward normal and increasing contractility. The SV may result from a decreased contractility (myocardial failure), from a primary increase in ventricular pressure (pressure overload), or or from an increase in ventricular volume (volume overload) (Box 10-2). Myocardial failure may be primary (e.g., dilated cardiomyopathy) or may occur secondary to chronic volume or pressure overload. The most common causes for pressure overload in domestic animals are subaortic stenosis and hypertension (left-sided congestive heart determinant of early ventricular filling; adrenergic stimulation increases the rate of relaxation, improving relaxation to a greater extent than it improves contractility. Tachycardia shortens the duration of the diastasis. Loss of atrial contraction is one reason why dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy or myxomatous valvular degeneration develop heart failure when the atria start to fibrillate. Asynchronous relaxation (decrease in the uniformity of relaxation) of the left ventricle may be observed in cats with restrictive cardiomyopathy. LV hypertrophy decreases LV compliance and leads to poor diastolic function because of an increase in cardiomyocyte size, collagen formation, and wall thickening. Constrictive pericardial disease or cardiac tamponade impose their mechanical properties on those of the ventricle during the final phases of diastole. Hence, diastolic dysfunction results from abnormal relaxation (early diastole), abnormal compliance (early to late diastole), or external constraint by the pericardium (tamponade).",

A reactive neuroendocrine activation decreases parasympathetic drive (immediate and short-lived) and increases sympathetic drive (slow but long-lasting), causing vasoconstriction (increasing arterial impedance) and tachycardia. A decrease in renal blood flow leads to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, contributing to vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention (increases the circulating volume). To maintain ABP, the cardiovascular system allows the venous pressure to increase and redistributes CO, maintaining blood flow mostly to essential organs. The cardiomyocytes also undergo changes to adapt to ventricular dysfunction, initially by performing extra work (stable hyperfunction) but over a long period these cardiomyocytes die (exhaustion and progressive cardiosclerosis phase).

In some cell systems, apoptosis can be triggered by the presence of excessive amounts of oxygen free radicals. Cells dying by apoptosis shrink and form apoptotic bodies. In contrast to cell death by necrosis, apoptosis is not accompanied by an inflammatory reaction and fibrosis.",

In pigs with various septicemias, such as salmonellosis and colibacillosis, the gastric fundic mucosa is often severely congested and hemorrhagic because of venous endothelial damage and thrombosis. In severe local infections, such as in metritis or hepatic abscesses, inflammation extends into the walls of adjacent veins and produces phlebitis, with or without thrombosis. Intravenous injections of irritant solutions, injecting solutions into the vascular wall, or intimal trauma produced by indwelling venous catheters result in vascular damage and create an opportunity for localization and proliferation of infectious agents and development of phlebitis and thrombosis . Animals with phlebitis complicated by thrombosis have the additional risk of septic embolism, which can cause endocarditis and pulmonary abscesses or pulmonary infarcts.",

Muscular pulmonary arteries of cats are frequently affected, and the lesion has been associated with infection by several parasites, including Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (the lungworm of cats), Toxocara sp., and Dirofilaria immitis ( Fig.  10-25) . However, the lesions often occur in the absence of parasitic infections ( Fig. 10-26) . Often, no clinical disease is associated with the lesion in cats, but asthmatic signs have been seen in cats with these parasitic infections. Similar hypertrophy of muscular pulmonary arteries occurs in cattle with hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction and subsequent pulmonary hypertension associated with right-sided heart failure from exposure to high altitudes (so-called high-altitude disease or \"brisket disease\") (see section on the stages of myocardial hypertrophy). Also, cardiovascular anomalies that shunt blood left to right in animals result in pulmonary hypertension; these animals may have hypertrophy of the muscular pulmonary arteries, which can result in plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy.

Bull terriers and boxers are predisposed, and a genetic basis is present in the Newfoundland dog, in which subvalvular aortic stenosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) results from a raised, partial or complete fibrous ring that arises from the endocardium below the aortic valve and may extend to involve the cranioventral leaflet of the mitral valve and the base of the aortic valve ( Fig. 10-33) . The lesion is also observed in the German shorthair pointer, golden retriever, Great Dane, Rottweiler, Samoyed, and bull terrier breeds. In clinical cases, the stenosis is produced by the presence of a thick zone of endocardial fibrous tissue that encircles the LVOT below the valve. In mild cases, often subclinical, the lesion is limited to white nodules on the ventricular septum immediately below the valve. Microscopically, the altered endocardial tissue contains loosely arranged elastic fibers, mucopolysaccharide ground substance, and collagen fibers admixed with fibroblasts and chondrocyte-like cells. Other cardiac lesions develop as a result of the altered left ventricular outflow; these include left ventricular concentric hypertrophy, disseminated foci of myocardial necrosis, fibrosis in the inner left ventricular wall, and thickening of the walls of intramyocardial arteries.",

Young adult to middle-aged males (1 to 3 years old) are often affected. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is caused by sarcomeric defects in cardiomyocytes, of which two mutations in cardiac myosin-binding protein C (MYBPC) have been identified in Maine coon and ragdoll cats. Altered sarcomeric function ultimately results in myocytes hypertrophy, collagen synthesis, and myocytes disarray (defined as cellular disorientation of cardiomyocytes in which cardiomyocytes are oriented perpendicular or obliquely to each other forming tangled patterns and/or pinwheel configurations). The left ventricle wall progressively thickens ( Fig.  10-41) , and its lumen narrows (nondilated concentric hypertrophy) (heart weight to body weight ratio of 7.0 \u00b1 0.3 g/kg compared to normal cats' heart weight to body weight ratio of 3.83 \u00b1 0.2 g/kg). In addition, mild right ventricular enlargement is occasionally present. Left ventricular concentric enlargement results in impairment of the left ventricle's ability to relax during diastole (diastolic failure). Increased left ventricular diastolic filling pressure leads to enlargement of the left atrium with subsequent blood backing up to the lungs, resulting in congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema and/or pleural effusion. In a subset of cases, in addition to concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, the interventricular septum contains hypertrophied, anteriorly displaced papillary muscles that pull the chordae tendineae and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve into the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), resulting in a dynamic LVOT obstruction during systole (systolic anterior motion [SAM] of the mitral valve).

The lumen of small coronary vessels is severely narrowed due to smooth muscle proliferation and increased connective tissue elements. Replacement fibrosis due to myocardial infarction/necrosis is occasionally found in regions of remodeled coronary arterioles, implying a probable causal relationship (see Figs. 10-41 and 10-42; E- Fig. 10-20) . Idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in dogs is an infrequent pathology, unlike in cats. It is defined as inappropriate concentric myocardial hypertrophy of a nondilated left ventricle in the absence of an identifiable stimulus for the hypertrophy.

Hypertrophy of the left ventricle has been reported to be symmetrical (i.e., both left ventricular free wall and interventricular septum) in most dogs.

The disease often has a familial pattern in the affected breeds, and it appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive mode in the Portuguese water dog breed; as an autosomal dominant mode in the Irish wolfhound, Newfoundland, and Doberman pinscher dog breeds; and likely as an X-linked recessive mode in boxer dogs. At autopsy (syn: necropsy), lesions of congestive heart failure are present and the hearts are rounded because of biventricular dilation (Figs. 10-43 and 10-44), whereas in some cases dilation of the left atrium and ventricle predominates. The ratio between the ventricular wall and chamber diameter is decreased (i.e., eccentric hypertrophy). The circumference of the annulus of the mitral and tricuspid valves is often increased, and the papillary muscles are often flattened and atrophic. Atrioventricular valvular leaflets are occasionally mildly to moderately thickened, and chordae tendineae are thickened and elongated. The dilated cardiac chambers often have a diffusely white, thickened endocardium. Myocardial hypertrophy is best demonstrated by calculating heart weight to body weight ratio. The term hypertrophy implies a pathologic process in which the weight of the organ is increased because of an increase in cell size rather than number. In myocardial eccentric hypertrophy, the sarcomeres are increased in numbers in series (rather than parallel as in concentric hypertrophy). Two histological patterns have been described in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy. The attenuated wavy fiber type is seen in many giant, large and medium-sized dogs and the fatty infiltrationdegenerative type of dilated cardiomyopathy is seen in mainly boxers and Doberman pinschers. Occasionally, there are additional nonspecific findings, such as necrosis, infarcts, fibrosis, vacuolization of myocytes, and hyperplasia of coronary arteries. In the attenuated wavy fiber type, the cardiomyocytes are less than 6 \u00b5m in diameter (normal myofiber diameter ranges from 10 to 20 \u00b5m) and have a wavy appearance. The myocytes are separated by clear spaces (i.e., edema fluid), and there is minimal to absent cellular infiltrates. The abnormal attenuated wavy fibers are most abundant in the lateral wall of the left ventricle and therefore this site should be sampled when dilated cardiomyopathy is suspected. The sensitivity and specificity of attenuated wavy fibers of the myocardium of dogs for the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy have been shown to be 98% and 100%, respectively. The attenuated wavy fibers form may represent an early pathologic change in the myocardium of dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy because it has been documented in dogs preceding clinical signs of dilated cardiomyopathy. In the fatty infiltration-degenerative type of dilated cardiomyopathy, histopathology consists of myocytolysis, myofiber degeneration, vacuolization, and atrophy along with extensive fibrosis and fatty infiltration that replaces the myofibers. It is proposed that the two histologically distinct forms of idiopathic canine dilated cardiomyopathy reflect different disease processes. Cardiotoxicity leading to chamber dilation similar to DCM (i.e., secondary dilated cardiomyopathy) has been reported secondary to toxic/environmental (e.g., doxorubicin, irradiation, ethanol, cobalt, lead, catecholamines, histamine, and methylxanthines), infectious (e.g., canine parvovirus), and nutritional (taurine and carnitine deficiency) causes. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare feline primary myocardial disease with a suggested complex genetic inheritance that results in a systolic heart failure rather than a diastolic heart failure as seen in cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Most cats develop secondary dilated cardiomyopathy because of nutritional deficiency (taurine), toxicity (doxorubicin), or severe volume overload (severe mitral insufficiency or congenital defects leading to severe left to right shunting) or, rarely, infection with feline panleukopenia virus. The heart globally enlarges through dilation of all chambers (eccentric hypertrophy), and the heart to body weight ratio is increased (5.4 \u00b1 0.3 g/kg vs. 3.83 \u00b1 0.2 g/kg in normal control cats), although the walls of the ventricles are thinned. This is due to addition of sarcomeres in series, rather than in parallel, which leads to a proportional increase in ventricular wall thickness and internal chamber diameter. Hydrothorax, pulmonary congestion, and edema often accompany dilated cardiomyopathy when congestive heart failure ensues. Similar to cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arterial thromboembolism occasionally accompanies feline dilated cardiomyopathy, unlike in dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiac histopathology consists of mild multifocal to severe and diffuse interstitial edema and fibrosis. Myocardiocytes are thinner, attenuated, and wavier than normal, and they often exhibit myocytolysis.",

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a functional term rather than disease entity and consists of a spectrum of pathologic phenotype and pathophysiology. The hallmark of restrictive cardiomyopathy is increased stiffness of the myocardium that leads to diastolic heart failure. Stiffness is due to increased myocardial fibrosis and variable infiltration with leukocytes. Sometimes the endocardium is also involved (endomyocardial fibrosis), and it is thought to be a specific subtype of restrictive cardiomyopathy. When the endocardium is involved, there is extreme endocardial thickening secondary to fibrosis and granulation tissue. Restrictive cardiomyopathy in cats can have two types of endocardial changes resultant in impaired vascular filling. In one type, the left ventricular endocardium has diffuse notable fibrosis. Evidence suggests that the fibrotic lesion is preceded by endomyocarditis. The second type results from excessive moderator bands that traverse the left ventricular cavity. Other examples of restrictive cardiomyopathy in animals include endocardial fibrosis in certain strains of aged rats and congenital endocardial fibroelastosis in Burmese cats (Fig. 10-45) .",

In human beings with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, a variety of single-gene mutations have been documented. The mutations affect genes that encode sarcomere proteins of cardiac myocytes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-associated altered cardiac proteins include cardiac \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T and tropomyosin, and myosin-binding protein C. Dilated cardiomyopathy-associated mutated proteins include desmin, mitochondrial proteins, dystropin, titin (titin spans the sarcomere and connects the Z and M restricting the range of sarcomere stretching motion), and a subunit of the surface protein-dystropin-associated glycoproteins. It remains unclear how these mutant proteins result in functional and structural alterations of cardiac muscle cells. However, recent studies suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may arise from defective energy transfer from the mitochondria to the sarcomere. Dilated cardiomyopathy is believed to be associated with abnormalities in the cytoskeletal proteins resulting in abnormal force generation, force transmission, or myocyte signaling. Similar gene mutations and altered proteins were recently discovered in the various heritable cardiomyopathies of animals.",

These plant-induced syndromes of cattle have been called by different names in various areas of the world, such as \"Manchester wasting disease\" in Jamaica, \"enzootic calcinosis\" in Europe, \"Naalehu disease\" in Hawaii, \"enteque seco\" in Argentina, and \"espichamento\" in Brazil. Multiple, large, white, rough, firm plaques of mineralized fibroelastic tissue are present in the endocardium and intima of large elastic arteries. Fibrosis, with or without mineralization, occurs in chronically dilated hearts, in hearts of debilitated cattle with Johne's disease ( Fig. 10-53 ; also see , in dogs with healed lesions of left atrial ulcerative endocarditis associated with a prior uremic episode (see Fig. 10-52) , and in the so-called jet lesions produced by the trauma of refluxed blood in valvular insufficiencies.",

Turbulent intracardiac blood flow associated with congenital anomalies or the presence of intracardiac and vasculature devices, such as catheters, may contribute to initiation of the lesion.

Hemothorax and hemoabdomen arise from spontaneous or traumatic rupture of large arteries or veins or from rupture of aneurysms located in the thoracic or abdominal cavity, respectively. An aneurysm is a localized dilation or outpouching of a thinned and weakened portion of a vessel. Usually, arteries are affected, especially large elastic arteries, but the lesion can also occur in veins. Known causes include copper L involvement at arterial branching sites, in which blood flow is turbulent. Grossly, the lesions are seen as slightly raised, firm, white plaques. Microscopically, initially the intima is thickened by accumulation of mucopolysaccharides and later by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media and fibrous tissue infiltration into the intima. Splitting and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina are common Atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis, the vascular disease of greatest importance in human beings, occurs only infrequently in animals and rarely leads to clinical disease such as infarction of the heart or brain. The principal alteration is accumulation of deposits (atheroma) of lipid, fibrous tissue, and calcium in vessel walls, which eventually results in luminal narrowing. Many studies have established that the pig, rabbit, and chicken are susceptible to the experimental disease produced by the feeding of a high-cholesterol diet; the dog, cat, cow, goat, and rat are resistant. Lesions of the naturally occurring disease have been detected in aged pigs and birds (especially parrots) and in dogs with hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus that develop an accompanying hypercholesterolemia. Arteries of the heart, mesentery, and kidneys are prominently thickened, firm, and yellow-white ( Fig. 10-66, A) . Microscopically, lipid globules accumulate in the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells and macrophages, often termed foam cells, in the media and intima (see Fig.  10 -66, B and C). Necrosis and fibrosis develop in some arterial lesions. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has been extensively studied in human beings. The vascular response-to-injury hypothesis is the current proposed mechanism of injury. The dyslipoproteinemia associated with diabetes or hypothyroidism in the dog results in endothelial injury. A variety of mechanisms, including oxygen free radical production, increase the decay of nitric oxide and decrease its vasodilator activity. The damaged endothelial cell allows lipoproteins to accumulate within the intima, where they are oxidized by free radicals generated by macrophages and endothelial cells. The oxidized products are directly toxic to endothelium and smooth muscle cells. Cellular debris is ingested by macrophages and smooth muscle cells, resulting in the formation of \"foam cells.\" The lesion in dogs differs from that of human beings with respect to the location of lipid, which is abundant throughout the wall of the artery in contrast to human beings, who have lipid accumulation in the tunica intima. The chronic progression of atherosclerosis may result in narrowing of the lumen, ulceration and thrombosis, and hemorrhage or aneurysmal dilation.",

Medial calcification occurs spontaneously in horses, rabbits, aged guinea pigs, and in rats with chronic renal disease.

African horse sickness is an insect-borne (Culicoides spp.) viral disease of Equidae that is endemic in Africa, the Middle East, India, and Spain.

The febrile disease may produce high mortality (up to 95%) and appears in several clinical forms, including the subacute cardiac form described here, as well as an acute respiratory form with massive pulmonary edema. The pathogenesis is initiated by the introduction of the virus by bites of the insect vector. The virus proliferates in local lymph node, and viremia ensues. The virus has a tropism for endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages, and increased vascular permeability, edema, hemorrhage, and microthrombosis are produced. The gross lesions are extensive subcutaneous and intermuscular edematous swelling of the head and neck. Massive hydropericardium is present with accompanying epicardial and endocardial ecchymotic hemorrhages. Histopathologically, endothelial degeneration and necrosis occur with the edema. In the myocardium, hemorrhage, edema, and focal myocardial necrosis can be present. Nodular suppurative lesions of lymphangitis often ulcerate and discharge pus onto the surface of the skin.

Dietary microangiopathy of pigs or \"mulberry heart disease\" is produced by a deficiency of vitamin E and/or selenium and the resultant effect on the microvasculature, which is characterized by fibrinoid necrosis, and thromboses of small vessels resulting in microhemorrhages. The hemorrhage results in major discoloration of the epicardial surface of the heart, particularly the right atrium said to resemble a mulberry (Figs. 10-76 and 10-77). In addition to the epicardial hemorrhages, hydropericardium often ensues. Massive hemorrhagic hepatic necrosis (hepatosis dietetica) is also produced with vitamin E and/or selenium deficiency (see Fig. 8-74 ). With either form of the disease, fibrinoid necrosis of small muscular arteries and arterioles is widespread and is accompanied by endothelial damage and fibrin thrombi in capillaries, especially capillaries of the myocardium (Fig. 10-78 ; E- Fig. 10-26 ). This complex of vascular lesions has been termed dietary microangiopathy. The distinctive hemorrhagic lesions are attributed to disruption of the clotting mechanism and thrombocytopenia. The gross lesions are characterized by widespread congestion, edema, and hemorrhage. Hemorrhagic visceral lymph nodes and splenomegaly are present along with petechial hemorrhages of the renal cortices, epicardium, and other serosal surfaces. Pulmonary edema and hydrothorax also occur. Microscopically, viral-induced vascular alterations include congestion, hemorrhage, and edema with fibrin microthrombi (E- Fig. 10-28) .

The pathogenesis of the disease is initiated by inhalation of the virus from direct contact with infected pigs or by ingestion of uncooked infected pork.

See the discussion on anthrax in the section on Disorders of Ruminants (Cattle, Sheep, and Goats), Blood and Lymphatic Vascular Systems, Blood Vessels, and also Chapter 4. Dilated (Congestive) Cardiomyopathy. Dilated or congestive cardiomyopathy is an important cause of congestive heart failure in dogs. Some affected dogs have low tissue concentrations of taurine, but supplementation has not proved beneficial. Affected dogs often are males of large breeds, such as Doberman pinschers, Portuguese water dogs, Dalmatians, Scottish deerhounds, Irish wolfhounds, Saint Bernards, Afghan hounds, Newfoundland dogs, Old English sheepdogs, Great Danes, and boxers, although smaller breeds, such as English cocker spaniels, may be affected. The disease often has a familial pattern in the affected breeds and appears to be inherited as an autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive trait. At necropsy, lesions of congestive heart failure are present and the hearts are rounded because of biventricular dilation (see Figs. 10-43 and 10-44). The dilated cardiac chambers often have a diffusely white, thickened endocardium. Microscopic and ultrastructural alterations are nonspecific, can be either mild or absent, and may include interstitial fibrosis and fatty infiltration and changes of myocyte degeneration, including the occurrence of so-called attenuated wavy fibers. See the discussion on cardiomyopathies in the section on A B by 10 years of age. Other breeds with high incidence include the cocker spaniel, Lhasa apsos, bichons, Yorkshire terriers, shih tzus, dachshund, poodle, Pomeranian, miniature schnauzer, Chihuahua, fox terrier, Boston terrier, and Pekingese. At autopsies (syn: necropsies) of 3245 dogs, gross lesions occurred on the mitral valve alone (57.3%), mitral and tricuspid valves (26.6%), tricuspid valve alone (7.5%), aortic valve alone (2.1%), pulmonic valve alone (0.4%), and in combinations (6.1%). The lesions in MVD become progressively worse with age. Affected valves are shortened and thickened (nodular), either focal or diffusely, and appear smooth and shiny ( Fig. 10-83 ) rather than rough and granular, as is usual in cases of valvular endocarditis. MVD is grossly classified into four groups as follows: type 1, a few small discrete nodules in the area of contact that are associated with areas of diffuse opacity in the proximal portion of the valve; type 2, larger nodules that are evident in the area of contact, which tend to coalesce with their neighbors, along with areas of diffuse opacity that may be present; type 3, large nodules that coalesced",

Myxomatous valvular degeneration (valvular endocardiosis) is the most common cardiovascular disease in dogs, and it is the most common cause of congestive heart failure in old dogs.

Myxomatous valvular degeneration (MVD) is an age-related cardiac disease of middle-aged to old dogs, especially small, toy, and medium-sized breeds. Males of affected breeds develop the disease at an earlier age than females. MVD appears to have a polygenic inheritance in dachshunds and Cavalier King Charles spaniels. The Cavalier King Charles spaniel breed has a unique susceptibility, with more than 50% prevalence by 4 years of age and 100% prevalence into irregular, plaque-like deformities that extend to involve the proximal portions of the chordae tendineae; and type 4, there is gross distortion and \"ballooning\" of the valve cusp, and the chordae tendinea are thickened proximally ( Fig. 10-84 ). These lesions result in valvular insufficiency with subsequent atrial dilation and development of atrial \"jet lesions.\" The jet lesion is a raised, rough, firm streak of endocardial fibrosis resulting from long-term trauma by a jet of blood leaking through the damaged valve in the closed position. Histologically, the valves are divided into four layers: atrialis, ventricularis, spongiosa, and fibrosa. The atrialis and ventricularis layers face the respective cardiac chambers and consist of endothelium and immediate subendothelial tissue containing fibroblasts, scattered collagen fibers, and a thin layer of elastic fibers. The spongiosa layer is loose connective tissue with interstitial cells and minimal fibers. The fibrosa consists of dense collagen that is continuous with the collagen core of chordae tendineae. Histopathologic lesions in MVD predominate in the distal third of the valve leaflets, and the incidence and severity increase with age. Lesions include progressive expansion of the spongiosa layer and disruption of the fibrosa layer.",

A wide variety of predisposing conditions may result in altered blood flow, hypercoagulability, or endothelial damage.

The thrombus in the pulmonary arteries lyses within a few hours and therefore may be absent at the time of autopsy (syn: necropsy) in approximately 15% of cases, as was indicated by one study. Because of extensive collateral pulmonary arterial circulation, the presence of a large thrombus in the pulmonary artery or its main branches makes a clinically relevant diagnosis of pulmonary artery thromboembolism more certain, unless antemortem ancillary tests such as pulmonary angiography and ventilation/ perfusion scanning are strongly supportive of it.",

Fibrocartilaginous embolism of the spinal cord vasculature and resultant infarction of the spinal cord supplied or drained by the obstructed blood vessel lead to posterior paresis or paralysis. Affected dogs are typically middle-aged large or giant breeds, but occurrence in young Irish wolfhounds has been reported. The mechanism of formation of the arterial or venous emboli is still unclear, but movement within the spinal vasculature of fibrocartilaginous fragments from degenerated intervertebral disks is generally considered to underlie the presence of these unusual emboli ( Fig. 10- Fig. 10-92) , and as the numbers increase, they are present in the right ventricle, then in the right atrium, and finally may occupy the vena cavae. Pulmonary hypertension results from vascular blockage and pulmonary vascular lesions produced by the parasites, and right ventricular hypertrophy follows. Right-sided heart failure may eventually develop. The pulmonary arteries containing parasites initially have an infiltration of the intima (termed endarteritis) by eosinophils, with subsequent development of an irregular fibromuscular proliferation of the intima visible grossly as a rough granular or shaggy appearance of the luminal surface (see Fig. 10 -92; E-Figs. 10-30 and 10-31). Live or dead parasites can be present within these vascular lesions and be accompanied by thromboembolism and pulmonary infarction. The pleura of the caudal lung lobes may contain multifocal areas of hemorrhage, hemosiderosis, and fibrosis. The presence of a massive number of adult worms may result in filling the right heart extending into venae cavae, resulting in venal caval syndrome.

Many recent reports have described the occurrence of polyarteritis in a disease termed idiopathic necrotizing polyarteritis (idiopathic canine polyarteritis, juvenile polyarteritis syndrome) involving multiple arteries, including the coronary and meningeal arteries in dogs, most often pet and laboratory beagle dogs (\"beagle pain syndrome\"). Clinically, affected dogs typically show recurrent episodes of fever, body weight loss, and occasionally cervical pain manifested by a stilted gait and stiff neck with a hunched body posture. However, some affected dogs do not display clinical signs of disease. The lesions are usually attributed to an immune-mediated vascular injury. Small and medium-sized muscular arteries in a wide variety of organs, including the heart, meninges, epididymis, and thymus, are selectively involved and grossly appear thick and tortuous, have associated focal hemorrhage, and develop aneurysms and thrombosis. Microscopically, the early lesions include fibrinoid necrosis and Arterial Thromboembolism and Thrombosis. Arterial thromboembolism and thrombosis occur in dogs and arise from injury to vascular endothelium, propagated via the coagulation cascade (see Chapter 2). In dogs, the most common site is the aortoiliac trifurcation ( Fig. 10-91 ), in which a thromboembolus extends from the caudal aorta distally to the external and internal iliac arteries. Embolization of the subclavian and brachial arteries also results in lameness of the forelimb, albeit less commonly. Other sites include embolization of the coronary arteries in the heart, renal arteries, and intestinal arteries. Aortoiliac thromboembolism in dogs has been reported with infection by Spirocerca lupi and Blastomyces dermatitides and in association with various disease conditions, such as proteinlosing nephropathy, hypothyroidism, hypercortisolism, diabetes mellitus, and aortic neoplasia.",

Arterial thromboembolism (ATE) is defined as obstruction usually followed by infarction of arterial beds by embolic material derived from a thrombus from a distant site and in the presence of intact endothelial surface (to be distinguished from arterial thrombosis). The most common cause of ATE in cats is cardiomyopathy in which a large thrombus is formed in the enlarged left atrium. However, other conditions, such as protein-losing nephropathy/enteropathy, sepsis, DIC, and endocrinopathies, should be considered in the diagnostic workup. The fate of the infarcted area depends on the ability to establish collateral blood flow, thus bypassing the occluded artery. In cats and dogs, the most common site is the aortic trifurcation (\"saddle embolus\"), and the right subclavian artery is the second most common cause of ATE in cats with cardiomyopathy. Renal, splanchnic, and cerebral circulations can also be affected on occasion. In a saddle embolus, occlusion of limb(s) blood flow results in ischemic neuromyopathy of the limb(s). Grossly, distal limbs below the stifle are most severely affected, and the affected limb is often dark red to blue and edematous due to hemorrhagic ischemic necrosis.Feline Infectious Peritonitis. Feline infectious peritonitis is a severe viral infection that produces phlebitis in various organs. This lesion appears to result from deposition of immune complexes, which subsequently induce an inflammatory reaction in affected vessels (see Chapters 4, 7, and 11).Heartworm-Associated Respiratory Disease. Dirofilaria immitis infection in cats occasionally results in heartworm-associated respiratory disease. Cats are more susceptible than dogs to infection with Dirofilaria immitis, although many do not have adult worms or have only a few (one to four worms). Grossly, there may be a visible shaggy or roughened appearance to the large lobar arteries, especially the right caudal lobar artery. The pulmonary arteries develop villus endarteritis with medial hypertrophy (see Fig. 10-26) . Initially, small pulmonary arteries may become embolized and infarcted, leukocytic invasion of the intima and media (E- Fig. 10-33) . In chronic lesions, inflammatory cells and fibrosis involve all layers of the vascular wall.",

Primary lymphedema is a rare pathology in dogs that often involves the distal hindlimbs, and it results from aplasia/hypoplasia of superficial lymphatic vessels and/or draining lymph nodes of the distal hindlimbs. Antemortem, dogs are being presented with nonpainful pitting edema of the distal hindlimbs. At autopsy (syn: necropsy) there is lymphatic hypoplasia and/or absence of popliteal lymph nodes with distal secondary lymphatic hyperplasia. Marked delay in lymphatic filling in lymphangiography, in lymphoscintigraphy, or in the patent blue violet dye absorption test are antemortem ancillary test results that strongly support the diagnosis of primary lymphedema.Primary Intestinal Lymphangiectasia. Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia is a rare intestinal pathology of dogs that results in severe protein-losing enteropathy. The Lundehund breed is predisposed. Clinically, dogs are presented for wasting, diarrhea, and ascites. Lacteals in the intestinal villi are fused, blunted, and have markedly distended tips, whereas lymphatic vessels throughout the wall of the intestine, and occasionally mesentery and mesenteric lymph nodes, are distended with milky opaque fluid (i.e., chyle) (see Fig. 7-14) . In dogs, the role of obstruction of lymphatic vessels or their structural integrity (i.e., hypoplasia) in the pathogenesis of this disease is still unclear. Secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia is much more common and results from obstruction of lymphatic drainage by inflammation or neoplasia.",
