Morphologically similar virus particles, approximately 95 nm in diameter, were encountered in all three systems, and a common mode of virus assembly and maturation appeared to obtain. Virus assembly was shown to occur exclusively at internal cytomembrane interfaces, the Golgi complex appearing as the initial assembly site, which site became less focal as infection progressed due to the proliferation of Golgi smooth membranes and the dilation of cisternae and vesicles. The assembly process involved viral budding into cisternal and vesicular lumina, the virion thereby acquiring its limiting membrane. The envelope of such intracellular virions exhibited a poorly defined fringe, approximately 8 nm in width, which appeared to undergo a maturational change as the virions were discharged from the cell, such that, extracellularly, virions displayed a well-developed fringe, approximately 12 nm wide-a change especially noteworthy in the case of virions in infected mouse brain. The presence was noted in infected Vero cells-and in one instance in an infected mosquito cell-of crescent-shaped segments of thickened cisternal membrane, which possibly represented an early phase of viral assembly in which nucleocapsid aligned itself in close apposition to a membrane segment preparatory t.o the initiation of budding.",

An original electron microscopic st,udy of Cali- fornia onccphalitis (CE) virus by Murphy and colleagues (196Sa) revealed many unusual fcaturcs of virus developmental morphology, notably, t'he comparatively large size of the virions (98 nm in average diameter, as compared t,o 55 nm and 38 nm for groups A a,nd I3 arboviruses, respectiveIy), their r&tivclg unst,ructured interiors, and their seeming exclusive assembly at internal cytomembrane interfaces. Later, the Bunyamwera viruses were shown to possess essentially similar features (Murphy et al., 1968b) , and in a recent preliminary survey, Holmes (1971) concluded that it was likely that members of the Bunyamwera Supergroup as a whole (W.H.O. Scientific Group on Arboviruses, WHO Tech. Rep. Ser. 396, l-32, 1967) and certain antigenically unrelated viruses such as Anopheles A, possessed common properties of size, structure, and mode of development comparable to those originally described for California encephalitis virus.",

An electron microscopic study was made of virus replication in a continuous vertebrate (Vero) and an ecologically relevant invertebrate (A. albopictus) cell line. Information was sought on whether host-dependent nuances of difference obtained in these phylogenetically diverse systems. The utility of the suckling mouse brain system in the study of the morphology of virus replication had been amply demonstrated by Murphy et al. (1968a, b) , in terms of high potential sensitivity to virus infection and high virus yields. In the present study, this in vivo system was studied in parallel with the in vitro systems, in the expectation that a more complete picture of events might be obtained.",

The evidence strongly suggested that the Golgi complex represented the initial site of virus replication, Virions appeared to form by budding into the lumina of cisternae and vesicles, acquiring their limiting membrane from the host cell membrane system in the process. A noteworthy finding, in brain cells especially, at early stages of infection, was the presence of virions, individually packaged within closefitting membranous enclosures. This feature was previously noted by Murphy et al. (1968a) . The evidence here suggests t'hat these complexes are formed by the segmentation of virus-charged Golgi cisternal elements (Fig. 11) . It seems likely that these, as well as larger groups of virions within vacuoles, migrate to the plasma membrane where discharge of the viral particles occurs by the normal discharge process whereby vesicular contents are extruded from cells (Palade and Bruns, 1968) . Examination of the plasma membrane of infected cells failed to reveal viral budding processes at this site. Nuclear changes were never observed in infected cells.",

            "text": "The finding in infected Vero cells of discrete segments of thickened cisternal membrane (Fig. 2 ) provided a possible clue to an early stage of the virus assembly process. It is possible that such structures are formed when viral nucleocapsids align themselves in close apposition to segments of cisternal membrane, modified conceivably, by the insertion of viral-specified proteins. The edges of the membrane segment are visualized as fusing as the budding process is completed at the terminal stage of virus assembly. Altered segments of vesicular membrane were described by Becker et al. (1967) in cells infected with avian infections bronchitis virus, a member of the coronavirus group, where they appeared to represent the initial stage of virus assembly. In the present study, stages intermediate between the crescent-shaped membrane complexes and viral buds on pediceller stalks were not encountered. The envelopment of electron-dense spherical nucleoids, so characteristic a feature of Group A arbovirus assembly (Acheson and Tamm, 1967) has not been observed with California encephalitis virus. Prominent inner shells were not encountered, and only occasionally was there the suggestion of a coiled inner component. The granulofibrillar matrix, in which a relatively uniform-sized population of spherical vesiclelike structures was frequently found, was regularly encountered in areas of the cytoplasm adjacent to sites of virus assembly in brain cells. The matrices appeared to be composed mainly of large aggregates of randomly oriented fine filamentous structures, 3-7 nm in width. Their close topographical relationship to sites of viral assembly, in addition to the fact of their absence in uninfected cells, suggests that they may represent accumulation of viral components such as nucleocapsids and smooth membrane elements, from which milieu virions may sometimes be generated. This is suggested in Fig. 15 . Saikku and colleagues (1971) presented evidence suggesting that Inkoo virus, a Finnish subtype of the California encephalitis virus group, possessed a noncubical, filamentous nucleocapsid, the strands of which, in unwound regions measured 2-3 nm in diameter, and in tightly coiled regions measured 7-10 nm. The findings in the present report, while indirect, are not incompatible with those of the Finnish workers. Additional studies with purified CE virus, currently in progress, are clearly necessary to arrive at an unambiguous interpretation of nucleocapsid structure.",

Cell-associated virions, located within vacuoles and closefitting membranous enclosures possessed a relatively smooth trilaminar limiting membrane on an exterior aspect of which was a closely adhering fine halo (as seen, for example in Fig. 3 ). Virions released from cells, on the other hand, appeared to undergo a maturational change in their limiting membrane structure, which became more ragged in appearance, and differentiated to exhibit a fringe of surface projections. This change seems to be accompanied by a redistribution in electron density wit,hin the particle; in general, the limiting membrane complex of \"intracellular\" virions was more densely stained than the interior of the particles, while in extracellular fully mature virions (e.g., in Fig. 13) , the well-developed fringe on the exterior of the particles was less densely stained than their interior aspect. As viewed by the negative contrast technique, this fringe appears to consist of fine spicules or loops, approximately 12 nm in length. The change in surface st'ructure was not as obvious in mosquito cell virions (Fig.  7) , although the ragged outline of a number of viral particlrs (top of figure) suggest a transitional stage.",
