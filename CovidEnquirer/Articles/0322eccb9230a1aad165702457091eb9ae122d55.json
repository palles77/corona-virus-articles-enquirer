            "text": "The first session titled \"Blood-Borne Infectious Agents and Their Impact on Blood Safety\" provides a state-of-the-science overview of the risks to blood safety posed by infectious agents. Additionally, this session addresses the strategies used to mitigate these risks in the United States including the introduction of increasingly sensitive laboratory screening testing platforms and PRTs for PLTs and plasma products. In a first part, the session includes a general overview of the evolution of responses to established, emerging, and reemerging transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases in the past 50 years. Further, it addresses the need for ongoing surveillance for and systematic responses to emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), optimally with sensitive metagenomics, multiplexed nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) and serologic testing strategies in sentinel global donor populations. This is followed by a review of the major policy issues pertaining to the development and implementation of PRTs, which if successfully adopted will provide insurance against known and unknown pathogens that may enter the blood supply. It will be noted that these technologies, if applied to all blood components or WB, may allow for the relaxation of redundant donor laboratory screening, modified donor questioning and/or deferral, and simplified handling of postdonation information while preserving or enhancing the safety of the blood supply. The session ends with an overview of the current status of approved pathogen-reduced (PR) PLT and plasma products in the United States with attention provided to their current effectiveness and safety profile. Major reasons for the slow adoption of the currently approved PR products in the United States are discussed including cost-effectiveness (CE) considerations.",

            "text": "Speaker's summary: Blood donor screening began in the 1940s with testing for syphilis, followed in the early 1970s by testing for hepatitis B surface antigen. The discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic viruses, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and introduction of progressively more sensitive serological assays targeting virus-specific antibodies and antigens for these \"classic\" transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) in the 1980s and 1990s was effective in interdicting the majority of infectious blood donations. 1 Implementation of NAT screening for HIV, HCV, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) further reduced the residual risk of infectious window period donations, such that per-unit risks are less than one in 1,000,000 in the United States (Fig. 1 ). [2] [3] [4] We now recognize that in addition to classic TTIs that establish chronic infection, agents that cause acute transient infections may also be TTI at significant rates if there are large epidemics or recurrent seasonal transmission. [5] [6] [7] Salient examples of EIDs where interventions were implemented in the United States include nationwide screening of donors for Trypanosoma cruzi using a one-time antibody testing strategy, 8 NAT testing for West Nile virus (WNV) 9, 10 and Zika virus (ZIKV), 11, 12 and testing for Babesia microti in endemic regions. 13, 14 Testing for bacterial contamination of PLT components was instituted in the 2000s to prevent septic transfusion reactions. 15 Donor deferrals were also implemented to reduce other risks including variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and several other agents. 16 Fig. 1 lists the EIDs for which interventions were implemented over the past two decades.",

            "text": "Proactive surveillance and research to evaluate responses to potential EID threats to blood safety have been adopted through collaborative initiatives of NIH, FDA, CDC, AABB, and blood research organizations. [5] [6] [7] An unintended consequence has been the identification of agents found through viral discovery programs using metagenomics technologies that can theoretically be transmitted by transfusion but which, upon subsequent investigation, prove not to be (Fig. 1 ). The most striking example of this was xenotrophic murine leukemia-related virus, which was reported to be associated with prostate cancer and later chronic fatigue syndrome and to be present in the blood of asymptomatic blood donors. 17 Intensive research consuming much time and money subsequently determined that xenotrophic murine leukemiarelated virus did not affect humans and was a laboratory contaminant from cell lines that contained this murine virus. 18 These experiences led to the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and FDA to convene workshops focused on proactive but rational and systematic responses to EIDs. 6, 7 The Alliance of Blood Operators developed a \"riskbased decision-making\" process that includes formalized methods for quantifying risk and evaluating interventions. 19 The 2015 to 2017 ZIKV pandemic is illustrative of the ongoing challenge of balancing timely and precautionary responses to emerging TTI threats with logistic and economic considerations. As the epidemic expanded in the Americas and the association of ZIKV with severe fetal outcomes emerged along with several cases of probable TT, the FDA mandated implementation of individual-donation (ID)-NAT or PRT of PLTs throughout the United States in 2016. 11, 12 After 2 years of ID-NAT with very low yield at an annual cost of $137 million, the FDA ZIKV policy was revised to allow for minipool NAT with ID-NAT triggered during future epidemics, similar to successful screening for WNV. Nonetheless, ZIKV testing now represents a theoretical benefit at a high cost, precipitating consideration of regional screening policies and an urgent need to further define \"tolerable risk\" in the blood safety arena. 20 Pathogen reduction: an overview of policy issues-Steve Kleinman, MD Speaker's summary: Pathogen inactivation and/or reduction should be viewed in the context of shifting the blood safety paradigm from reactive to proactive thereby providing insurance against known and unknown pathogens that may enter the blood supply or are currently un(der)recognized. Based on the positive experience of PI for plasma derivatives (e.g., no HIV, HCV, or HBV transmission since 1987), it seems reasonable to apply this safety paradigm to blood components. Of note, a consensus conference held in Canada in 2007 issued recommendations in favor of rapid adoption of a PI technology even if it could not be applied to the full range of blood components. Despite these recommendations, PI technology for PLTs has been slow to be adopted in the United States. As described in Table 1 , the reasons for this are many but it appears that the predominant impediment has been cost.",

The risk of TT of an agent and/or the occurrence of symptomatic or serious disease is likely to be less than this per-unit exposure risk.

Both PR products have a 5-day shelf life at 20 to 24 C. 23 The psoralen product currently is being evaluated in PIPER, a Phase IV postmarketing study. Other manufacturing systems are under varying degrees of development. 26, 27 One of these systems uses a different light-activated photochemical, riboflavin, and is currently being evaluated in the United States in a Phase III randomized clinical trial, MIPLATE. 28 A third PR technology uses a shorter wavelength of UV light (UVC), as the sole mechanism of inactivation. 27, 29, 30 It, too, is being evaluated in CAPTURE, a Phase III clinical trial in Europe.",

            "text": "Each of the techniques results in a reduction of the content and/or activity of the pro-and anticoagulant proteins in plasma. In general, these reductions do not exceed 20% to 30%, and for many proteins the reduction is less than this. The most notable reductions are in fibrinogen and Factors (F) VIII and FV across all platforms; F IX and FXI, protein C, and large von Willebrand factor multimers with Mirasol; and protein S and antiplasmin with Octaplas. [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] There have been few investigations of these treatments on complement components; in an analysis of Intercept plasma, C 3a was found to be reduced. 45 It has been noted that the reductions, while significant, usually resulted in contents within the reference range. 39 The pooled nature of SD plasma greatly reduces the variability in content that can easily be demonstrated between different donors' plasma samples. 46 Cryoprecipitate may be prepared from Intercept and Mirasol plasma units to meet the minimum content requirements, although the effect of the treatment is still evident. 47, 48 In vitro analyses of the clotting system have generally demonstrated substantial retention of clinically relevant function. 42, 44 As might be expected from the reduced contents noted, the resulting fibrin strands are thinner (with resulting increased clot density and reduced permeability) with longer lag time for formation or prolonged time to lysis. 49 Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated expected outcomes with the use of these PR plasma samples. Prophylactic transfusion of Intercept plasma into congenitally deficient patients yielded expected increases in the deficient factor in circulation with anticipated half-lives. 39 Use of large volumes of Intercept plasma in plasma exchanges for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura resulted in expected outcomes without generating adverse events or (new) coagulopathy. [50] [51] [52] Use of large volumes (approx. 2 L) of Intercept plasma in liver transplantation yielded the same outcomes as with quarantine plasma. [50] [51] [52] [53] The current formulation of Octaplas has not been reported to be associated with thrombotic events when used in large volumes as had been seen with the original version of SD plasma. 54 A theoretical question has been raised whether the reduced content these components might place massive transfusion recipients at increased risk of inadequate hemostasis and death. 55 One in vitro mixing study suggested that a 50% plasma replacement would be necessary before altering coagulation kinetics. 56 Several large, historically controlled experiences with Intercept plasma in trauma situations, however, have failed to show any impact on the need for other blood components, time to discharge or mortality. 32 These PR plasma samples have not been associated with increased adverse events after transfusion. 57 Because of the pooled basis of SD plasma, it is believed to carry a reduced risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) because of dilution of potentially offending antibodies. There have been no TRALI cases reported in more than 10 million Octaplas units transfused. 58, 59 If the existing risk of TRALI is greater than one in 5000, removal of this risk in itself makes use of SD plasma cost-effective. 60 This pooling, however, does increase the risk of early and wide dissemination of a nascent nonenveloped virus. 61 To date, there has been little uptake of PR plasma in the United States outside of Octaplas for patients with severe allergic reactions to single-donor plasma. This is probably due to the perception of viral safety (and lack of bacterial contamination risk) in standard plasma and the increased cost of these newer plasmas. Widespread introduction likely will follow only after implementation of similar systems for PLTs and RBCs despite admonishments from a consensus conference and demonstration of the importance of plasma transmission of new pathogens. Experiences from the nation's largest blood product supplier 62 and the blood bank at the NIH Clinical Center 63 were documented. Both reports stressed the relevance of strict volume and cell limits, not required without PRT, and their effect on collection procedures and failures. The approaches were almost diametrically opposed, reflecting the different donor settings: while the American Red Cross preferred small-volume over large-volume kits (2/3 vs. 1/3), the NIH Blood Bank exclusively used dual-storage kits. The American Red Cross is boosting PRT PLTs to meet the steadily increasing demand. The NIH Blood Bank has transitioned to 100% PRT PLT production, which was well received by the attending physicians and nurses.",

PLT count reduction of 5% to 10% are typical, and production planning must accommodate this loss.",

The plasma units, which are frozen within 8 hours of collection, are pooled (approx. 380 L from 630 to 1520 donors in the United States) and then filtered to remove residual cells and treated with a combination of 1% tri(nbutyl)-phosphate and 1% octoxynol to inactivate enveloped viruses. The residual S/D is removed by oil extraction and chromatography. The final product is sterile-filtered, aliquoted into 200-mL bags, and stored frozen. 94 Octaplas is indicated for replacement of coagulation factors in patients with acquired deficiencies due to liver disease or undergoing cardiac surgery or liver transplant and for plasma exchange in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Octaplas is contraindicated in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency and severe deficiency of protein S. All other contraindications, including a history of hypersensitivity to fresh-frozen plasma and/or plasma-derived products, are common to conventional plasma components. Octaplas may be stored for up to three years at not more than \u2212 18 C. After thawing, Octaplas may be stored for 24 hours at +1 to 6 C or for 8 hours at room temperature.",

Multiple studies have shown a comparative reduction in the rate of allergic reactions (Table 3) . [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] Pooling likely mitigates the risk of TRALI by diluting and neutralizing antibodies to human neutrophil antigen and HLA. The S/D process also removes bioactive lipids, which have been implicated as a causative factor in TRALI. While proving a negative is impossible, there have been more than 10 million units of Octaplas transfused with zero incidence of TRALI reported. 59 The levels of coagulation factors, protease inhibitors, and cofactors are tested for each lot before release. Older versions of S/D plasma were associated with hyperfibrinolysis and bleeding; 102-104 however, changes to the manufacturing process have mitigated the risk of these adverse events. 105 In several studies conducted with the current version of Octaplas, no additional risk of these or other adverse events was identified. 96, [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] No clinically relevant differences in efficacy were identified; however, most of these studies were small and may not have been powered to show significant differences. 96, [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] The University of Minnesota has chosen to maintain an inventory of Octaplas for patients who have a history of moderate to severe allergic transfusion reactions. It is especially helpful for patients who are undergoing plasma exchange, as they must contend with multiple units of conventional plasma. The extra time and effort saved by the reduction of reactions plus the increased comfort and safety experienced by the patient make the added cost of Octaplas worthwhile. In conclusion, the efficacy and safety profiles of Octaplas make it a good alternative to conventional plasma, and it is beneficial for patients with a history of allergic transfusion reactions.",

CEA is an assessment of the ratio of costs to benefits, comparing at least two different interventions. 113 Results are often reported as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The CE plane can be used to graphically display the results for CEA separately for costs and effects in a way that provides several insights into the relative efficiency of each of the interventions included in the analysis and thus is highly informative to the broader decision making process for PRT. 114 The health economics of PRT in the United States continues to be one of the barriers to broader adoption. For PRT there are several technologies, each with different mechanisms of action and inactivation capacity, which have been reviewed in detail in several previous publications. 26, 27, 58, [115] [116] [117] [118] These differences are important for the health economics of each technology. Although RBC inactivation and WB inactivation technologies are in development [119] [120] [121] [122] and clinical studies are under way, 121,123 current health economic evidence has not been published for these methods. Only two PRTs, S/D-treated plasma, and amotosalen plus UV light for PLTs and plasma are approved for use in the United States.",

A recently published BIA focused on an analysis for a mid-sized US hospital that was assumed to acquire 5500 apheresis PLT components per year from an external blood supplier. Several assumptions of this analysis sought to mimic a realistic situation: it was assumed that approximately 60% of acquired PLTs are irradiated and 20% are tested for CMV by the blood supplier. The model predicted minimal cost increase for PRT compared to conventional PLTs after including cost offsets such as elimination of bacterial detection and irradiation and differential reimbursement for treated and untreated PLTs. 38 Another BIA conducted for Italy concluded further studies based on actual numbers of PLT transfusion complications and their societal cost at a local level are needed to establish the full cost to benefit ratio of PLT PRT. 125 ",

Recent developments have focused on the use of PRT methods or modified methods using non-light-activated chemistry, to treat either WB or the RBC component separated from WB. Several of these products are in clinical phases of evaluation. The challenges faced are expected to be comparable to those experienced for the now broadly approved and implemented methods for treating PLTs and plasma with added complications and challenges due to the number of units required to be treated and the nature of the patients who receive RBC products compared to PLT and plasma components.

            "text": "Most PRT methods that have been implemented and are approved for use in the United States and outside the United States are based on the use of chemical additives to the blood products, which can be activated in specific ways to prevent nucleic acid replication of targeted pathogens and white blood cells (WBCs) in these products. 25 The nature of the compounds used in these approaches varies considerably based on method and include the use of riboflavin 134 and vitamin B2 as well as synthetically derived compounds such as amotosalen and amustaline, which are based on psoralen, acridine, and mustard hydrochloride derivatives, respectively. 135 In many cases, these agents and their breakdown products exhibit considerable toxicity and genotoxicity that must be considered in terms of likely patient population and effectiveness of both handling and removal methods intended to reduce exposure to patients and health care workers. 136 Processing requirements necessitated by the nature of the agents used have complicated the practical logistics of delivering blood products to patients. 118 Not all pathogens will be eliminated by the application of these processes Variable levels of PR are observed for bacteria and enveloped viruses depending on the method that is being applied. 137 Knowledge about what levels of inactivation are necessary to prevent disease transmission are not clear or uniform for all agents. 138, 139 Examples are now available from completed and ongoing routine use studies that suggest that while disease transmission may be significantly curtailed, some breakthrough events may still be anticipated including cases where pathogen loads in donated products may exceed inactivation potential 123 or where the PRT method may prove ineffective against specific types of resistant agents such as nonenveloped viruses. 140 Not all methods will deliver the same outcomes in pathogen load reduction capabilities; hence continued field evaluation of what is needed to significantly reduce the probability of disease transmission in areas where such diseases are endemic will be necessary to fully determine the extent of effectiveness. 131 Process control will be essential to assure reproducibility and reliability of these methods Significant efforts have been made by manufacturers to develop techniques that can be practically applied to treatment of PLT and plasma products in the routine blood bank setting. Such devices and processes need to account for practical factors including throughput, product specifications, media, product losses, timing of process steps, record keeping, and costs to manufacture disposables and equipment. Validation of these methods has required significant investment on the part of manufacturers yet concerns in each of these categories related to implementation remain and continue to be identified as these methods enter routine clinical use. 142 These processes will add cost Routine implementation in high-income countries where endemic disease and exposure are rare is likely to continue to be debated on the basis of cost and benefit. Advances in adoption are likely to result when these processes can serve low-income nations with significant blood safety concerns with affordable products made with high quality and low cost. Questions about implementation with patients who are most vulnerable and thus may benefit the most from these methods need to be asked. Such groups may include those receiving chronic transfusion support or pediatric patients where cost-benefit and risk-benefit calculations are likely to have their most favorable outcomes. 143 Providing products to regions with high endemic disease rates can greatly improve cost-benefit analyses but will require partnerships with nongovernmental organizations and longer-term considerations of sustainability in these environments when supplementation of costs is no longer feasible. 144 Clinical experience with pathogen reduction for red blood cells: completing the triad-Richard J.

INTERCEPT RBCs incorporate treatment of RBCs in AS with 0.2 mmol/L amustaline (S-303) in the presence of 20 mmol/L glutathione (GSH), in a closed system. 135 Amustaline rapidly crosslinks and/or forms adducts with nucleic acids to prevent pathogen replication without generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the active compound degrades to undetectable concentrations (<0.75 nmol/L) during processing. An exchange step into a licensed storage solution removes the majority of the breakdown products, resulting in treated RBCs with a 35-day shelf life. 145 Extensive testing confirmed a lack of neonatal and reproductive toxicity, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and acute and chronic toxicity, while confirming potent inactivation of a broad range of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and WBCs. 146 Animal models confirmed a lack of immunogenicity. Treated RBCs demonstrate reduced hemolysis and increased ATP levels compared to conventional irradiated RBCs. A similar closed-system process is in development for WB collections in collaboration with the Swiss Red Cross for use in austere environments. 147 INTERCEPT RBCs were successfully evaluated in a series of clinical trials demonstrating the safety, efficacy, and the performance of the system (Table 4 ). Radiolabeled recovery and survival studies in healthy volunteers confirm acceptable RBC recovery and life span, exceeding FDA requirements. 120, 148 A Phase III randomized controlled study (STARS) involving 51 complex cardiac surgery patients in Germany demonstrated that treated RBCs met the predetermined noninferiority margin for hemoglobin (Hb) content (mean treatment difference [test-control] of 2.27 g/unit [95% CI, \u22122.61 to \u22121.92 g/unit), within the prespecified equivalence margins (AE5 g/unit) and with reduced hemolysis at the end of storage. 149 Subjects received a mean of 2.9 (range, 1-8) test or control RBC components during surgery or within 7 days of surgery. Exploratory clinical endpoints, including renal and hepatic insufficiency and the 6-minute walk test, as well as adverse events, were not different, and no patients had antibodies specific for INTERCEPT RBCs.",

PR for RBC and WB products remains a major challenge in the development of safe blood products for transfusion and it is of major interest in the context of chronic transfusion protocols. The first technology evaluated was the use of riboflavin/UV (80 J/mL RBC) light (Mirasol) system for PR of WB. The riboflavin/UV light PR technology (Mirasol PRT system, or Mirasol) method is based on irreversible nucleic acid damage mediated by electron transfer processes at sites where riboflavin-guanine base chemistry occurs. 153, 154 Our group and others have already published significant information on the RBC viability of PR WB-derived RBCs in vitro in the context of high-dose illumination resulting in significant PR. 84, [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] [164] These sets of data indicate that PR of WB is possible albeit at a loss of RBC viability in vitro as assessed by hemolysis, ATP levels, and potassium leakage and in vivo as assessed by 24-hour recovery and survival analyses. 155, 156 Through a two-center clinical trial, our combined data consistently support that riboflavin/UV light-treated RBCs stored for 21 days after being generated from Mirasol-treated WB maintain adequate levels of 24-hour recovery as assessed by 51 Crtagged circulatory RBC survival analysis. As anticipated, there was decreased in vivo viability of poststorage riboflavin/UV light RBCs compared to data obtained from the same donors similarly stored untreated RBCs. The overall 24-hour recovery, survival, T 50 , and area under the curve (AUC) of Mirasol RBCs were reduced by 9.9, 25.9, 36.9, and 16.5%, respectively, compared to the subjects untreated control RBCs. 165 As expected, the percentage of RBC hemolysis significantly correlated with the 24-hour recoveries of the control RBCs but not with their T 50 survivals, suggesting that both hemolysis and 24-hour recoveries measured the destruction of a population of cells that did not survive storage. In contrast, there was no similar correlation between percent hemolysis and recoveries of Mirasol RBCs nor between their T 50 and percent hemolysis. However, for the Mirasol RBCs, there was a significant correlation between ATP levels and 24-hour recoveries, but a similar association was not found for control RBCs.",

This approach to target nucleic acid-containing pathogens does not require photochemical activation through the use of a small molecule (amustaline, S-303) that reacts rapidly with nucleic acid and then decomposes into unreactive byproducts. Published PI results show that amustaline treatment of RBCs effectively inactivates multiple blood-borne pathogens (\u22654 log) and residual WBCs. 147, [166] [167] [168] [169] To prevent nonspecific reactions of amustaline with RBC membrane proteins, GSH is used in conjunction with the amustaline treatment. In two different two-center studies we analyzed the viability of RBCs prepared with a second-generation process and stored for 35 days was evaluated in two different blood centers in a Phase I and II clinical trial design, respectively. Both were single-blind randomized, controlled, two-period crossover studies where amustaline or control RBCs were prepared in random sequence and stored for 35 days followed by 51 Cr tagging and 24-hour RBC posttransfusion recovery, mean life span, median lifespan (T 50 ), and life span AUC analyzed. The mean 24-hour posttransfusion recovery of test and control RBCs was comparable (83.2% AE 5.2% and 84.9% AE 5.9%, respectively; p = 0.06), and consistent with the FDA criteria for acceptable RBC viability. There were differences in the T 50 between test and control RBCs (33.5 and 39.7 days, 17% difference; p < 0.001) but it was within published reference ranges of 28 to 35 days. The AUC (percent surviving \u00d7 days) for test and control RBCs was similar (22.6 and 23.1% surviving cells \u00d7 days, respectively; p > 0.05). After infusion of test RBCs, there were no clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values or adverse events.",

Upon illumination, photochemicals bound to target produce singlet oxygen or other ROS or are involved with electron transfer and adduct formation, preventing further replication of the pathogen. Photochemicals localized in the supernatant can produce ROS, which can diffuse to the PLT or RBC membrane to produce oxidative damage or undergo electron transfer with other colocalized photochemicals, producing photochemical dimers. Photochemicals bound to the RBC or PLT membrane produce ROS, which can oxidize membrane components or produce covalent adducts to polyunsaturated lipids via electron transfer. 170 Off-target lesions are responsible for alterations of in vitro or in vivo properties of photochemically treated RBCs and PLTs. Most photochemicals are composed of fused rings of conjugated double bonds. When a photochemical absorbs light, it cannot dissipate the absorbed energy via bond rotation as heat because of the rigidity of the ring structure and therefore releases energy via fluorescence, phosphorescence, or photochemical reactions. On the other hand, flexible photosensitizers can dissipate absorbed light energy through bond rotation and, therefore, cannot readily act as a photochemical unless rigidly bound to substrate in a planar geometry.",

Unlike UV light, which induces direct DNA-based damage and/or oxidative damage in exposed microbial cells (depending on the exact UV wavelengths used), inactivation by violet-blue light involves the excitation of endogenous photosensitive porphyrin molecules found within exposed microbial cells. 175 Although less germicidally efficient, research has demonstrated that these lower-energy violet-blue 405-nm photons are particularly suited to decontamination of sensitive blood components and have potential operational advantages. A recent study 176 demonstrated the antimicrobial potential of 405-nm light for decontamination of key bacterial pathogens in blood plasma, with a complete 5-log reduction of Staphylococcus aureus in plasma using a dose of approximately 360 J/cm 2 . Importantly, antiviral potential has also been demonstrated in plasma, with a successful 5-log reduction of calicivirus after a 561 J/cm 2 light exposure. 177 A major finding demonstrated by the study 4 was that the higher penetrability of 405-nm light photons facilitates decontamination of prebagged transfusion products. Results showed significant antimicrobial efficacy within sealed plasma transfusion bags, with approximately 99% inactivation of S. aureus contamination in plasma achieved using low irradiance light at a dose of 144 J/cm 2 . Similar antimicrobial results were presented demonstrating successful decontamination of prebagged PLT suspensions, at comparative dose levels to those used with plasma.",

Results of sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting analysis were presented which highlighted the potential for \"safe\" treatment of blood plasma and the need for determining upper and lower threshold treatment levels, which would facilitate decontamination while retaining plasma and PLT integrity. With regard to PLTs, an evaluation of the in vivo recovery of light-treated (10 mW/cm 2 for 8 hr) PLTs in a murine model demonstrated no difference to that of nontreated PLTs. These results are encouraging; however, further investigation is needed on the impact of dose delivery (high irradiance light delivered over rapid exposure periods compared to low irradiance light over longer exposures), as this will influence the optimal treatment conditions for the blood components. Discussions highlighted the potential for the technology to be utilized for rapid treatment before storage (for PLTs or plasma) or incorporation into standard storage conditions for PLTs with the aim of extending the shelf life of these sensitive components.",

Thus, further research to expand the understanding and compatibility of this technology with blood transfusion products is warranted.",

The risks inherent in these emergency blood transfusions can be magnified by donor exposure to endemic diseases such as malaria and potentially to biowarfare agents. The possibility of myelosuppressive radiation exposure on the battlefield could require the inactivation of WBCs in blood products to reduce the risk of TA-GVHD.

            "text": "In addition to investing in technologies that use various photosensitizers and UV light to damage nucleic acids in pathogens and WBCs, the DOD has pursued alternative blood storage approaches to not only reduce infectious risks of transfusion but also increase the availability of PLTs, since current room temperature storage practices limit shelf life to 5 to 7 days. Refrigeration has been demonstrated to significantly reduce bacterial growth as well as reduce the metabolic activity of PLTs during storage, preserving their hemostatic function. Refrigerated PLTs retain significant capacity to adhere to collagen under shear, aggregate, release granules, catalyze thrombin generation, and contract clots for up to 21 days. 179 Refrigeration causes partial activation of PLTs, leading to desialylation of membrane proteins and clearance from circulation over 1-2 days in vivo. 180 Nevertheless, in a randomized trial in cardiac surgery patients, refrigerated PLTs stored for up to 14 days performed comparably to standard-of-care PLTs stored for less than 7days (K.M. Reddoch Cardenas and A. Cap, unpublished, 2019) . 181 PLTs can be refrigerated in either plasma or PAS, and preliminary results suggest that PRT-treated PLTs can also be refrigerated without loss of hemostatic function. 182, 183 Refrigeration thus offers not only an extra layer of protection from bacterial pathogens in addition to PRT, but also an opportunity to extend shelf life and availability while preserving the essential contribution of PLTs to bleeding control. It should be noted that refrigerated WB contains active PLTs that have been shown to maintain considerable hemostatic function through the entire shelf life of WB (up to 35 days in CPDA-1). 184, 185 The DOD is also supporting the development of other alternative storage modalities for PLTs such as cryopreservation and lyophilization. 178, 186 Both technologies offer extended storage times (years) and bacterial pathogen risk reduction and could be combined with PRT. While the clinical safety and efficacy of these products is being established, refrigeration with or without PRT offers a practical way to improve PLT product safety and availability. WB PRT remains an important capability gap for the US military, but a technology using riboflavin and UV light has been shown to yield a product with preserved hemostatic function and to inactivate Ebola virus, among other pathogens, and reduce transfusion-transmitted malaria; this technology is in Phase III trials. 123, 184, 187 Successful development of WB PRT will be a landmark achievement in the history of transfusion medicine and will benefit both civilian and military patients.",
