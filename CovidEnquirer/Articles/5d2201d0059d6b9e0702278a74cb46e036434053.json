            "text": "In vivo serial passage of non-pathogenic viruses has been shown to lead to increased viral virulence, and although the precise mechanism(s) are not clear, it is known that both host and viral factors are associated with increased pathogenicity. Under-or overnutrition leads to a decreased or dysregulated immune response and can increase viral mutant spectrum diversity and virulence. The objective of this study was to identify the role of viral mutant spectra dynamics and host immunocompetence in the development of pathogenicity during in vivo passage. Because the nutritional status of the host has been shown to affect the development of viral virulence, the diet of animal model reflected two extremes of diets which exist in the global population, malnutrition and obesity. Sendai virus was serially passaged in groups of mice with differing nutritional status followed by transmission of the passaged virus to a second host species, guinea pigs. Viral population dynamics were characterized using deep sequence analysis and computational modeling. Histopathology, viral titer and cytokine assays were used to characterize viral virulence. Viral virulence increased with passage and the virulent phenotype persisted upon passage to a second host species. Additionally, nutritional status of mice during passage influenced the phenotype. Sequencing revealed the presence of several non-synonymous changes in the consensus sequence associated with passage, a majority of which occurred in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and polymerase genes, as well as the presence of persistent high frequency variants in the viral population. In particular, an N1124D change in the consensus sequences of the polymerase gene was detected by passage 10 in a majority of the animals. In vivo comparison of an 1124D plaque isolate to a clone with 1124N genotype indicated that 1124D was associated with increased virulence.",

Because of this, the term 'quasispecies' is often used to describe the mutant spectra of viral genomes that constitute an RNA viral species (Domingo and Holland 1997) . Recent studies indicate that intra-host viral population diversity may be a prerequisite for a virulent infection (Vignuzzi, et al. 2006; Kuss, Etheredge, and Pfeiffer, 2008; Guti\u00e9 rrez, Michalakis, and Blanc 2012) although the nature of the infection (acute versus chronic) and viral lifecycle (i.e. vector-borne viruses) also influence the role of intra-host viral diversity in infection outcome (Weaver, Rico-Hesse, and Scott 1992; Jerzak, et al. 2007; Andersen et al. 2015) .",

            "text": "The precise mechanism(s) by which in vivo passage leads to increased virulence are not clear and may differ between viral families, genera, and even species. In vivo passage outcome is shaped by numerous factors including viral strain, genotypic diversity, size of the inoculum, route of exposure, and by host factors such as onset and strength of immune response (Kuss, Etheredge, and Pfeiffer, 2008; Guti\u00e9 rrez, Michalakis, and Blanc 2012; Morelli, et al. 2013) . Decreased immunocompetence may allow infecting viruses to cause prolonged infections which may increase the size and depth of genetic diversity present in the intra-host population of RNA viruses (Domingo 1997) . Immunocompetence of a host is determined by many factors such as age, pregnancy, and nutrient intake (Levander 1997; Beck, Levander, and Handy 2003; Beck 2007) . Recent studies by Beck and others suggest that both malnutrition and obesity adversely affect the ability of a host to mount a robust innate and adaptive immune response to viral infections (Beck, Handy, and Levander 2004; Zaki, Akuta, and Akaike 2005; Karlsson and Beck 2009) . For example, obese mice infected with influenza virus had a significantly higher mortality and increased lung pathology as compared with lean mice (Smith et al. 2007) . Similarly, infection of selenium deficient mice with an avirulent strain of Coxsackievirus B3 resulted in evolution of the virus into a virulent form that caused cardiac inflammation in both selenium deficient mice and normal control mice (Beck et al. 1995; Beck, Williams-Toone, and Levander 2003) .",

Both selenium and vitamin E are antioxidants and function to control oxidative stress that is induced as part of the host response to infection. Although production of reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide may play a role in microbial clearance, it may also act as a mutagen and therefore may expand the diversity of the mutant spectra by acting on the fidelity of the viral polymerases (Domingo 1997; Akaike et al. 2000) . The effect of oxidative stress on viral evolution has been demonstrated in a variety of viruses (influenza, coxsackie, polio, Sendai, and human immunodeficiency virus) and hosts (mouse, human) (Akaike et al. 2000; Beck et al. 2001; Beck, Williams-Toone, and Levander 2003; Beck, Handy, and Levander 2004) . Selenium deficiency has also been shown to impair the cellular and humoral immune response. Similarly, obesity leads to increased oxidative stress and immune dysregulation although through a different mechanism driven by chronic inflammation (Monteiro and Azevedo 2010; Kanneganti and Dixit 2012; Aroor and DeMarco 2014) . In particular, obesity has been shown to reduce cytokine production and NK cell cytotoxicity (Akaike et al. 2000; Beck et al. 2001; Beck, Williams-Toone, and Levander 2003; Beck, Handy, and Levander 2004; Smith et al. 2007 ). The presence of excess dietary iron, which has a pro-oxidant effect in vivo, may also increase viral titer and virulence (Beck, Handy, and Levander 2004) .",

In this study, we address this gap in knowledge by serial passage of Sendai virus (SeV) (genus Respirovirus, Paramyxoviridae family) in mice under three different dietary conditions: normal diet (ND), selenium-deficient diet (SD), and high fat diet (FD). Following the last serial passage in mice, individual bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) containing SeV from the three dietary conditions was used to infect guinea pigs under normal dietary conditions. Lung histopathology, viral titers, and cytokine profiles were used to characterize viral virulence within the hosts. Viral population dynamics were characterized using Illumina ultra-deep sequence analysis and computational modeling. SeV has a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome $15-16 kb in length which codes for six structural proteins: two glycoproteins hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion protein (F), a matrix protein (M), and three nucleocapsid proteins, Nucleoprotein (N), Phosphoprotein (P), and Large polymerase protein (L). The P gene which codes for the P protein also codes for an additional set of up to seven different nested polyproteins (P, V, W, C', C, Y1, and Y2) and may be referred to as 'P/V/C' (Lamb and Parks 2007) . The HN glycoprotein plays critical role in mediating the virus entry into host cell and structural modeling was used to assess the impact mutations in this gene may have on protein function.",

In the resulting sequencing data, the SeV plasmid insert had $1,000\u00c2 more coverage as compared with the RABV insert, about 10\u00c2 more than expected ratio of 100\u00c2.

The HN protein of human parainfluenza 3 virus (hPIV3) was identified as the closest Protein Data Bank (PDB) structural template for the modeling. It was experimentally solved at the resolution of 1.65 angstroms (\u00c5 ) (PDB entry: 4MZA) (Xu et al. 2013) , and the level of sequence identity between HN from Sendai and hPIV3 is 55%. Examples of other identified structural homologs that were leveraged during the modeling process include: HN from Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) (PDB entry: 1E8U; resolution: 2.00 \u00c5 ; sequence identity: 27%) (Connaris et al. 2002) , HN from Simian virus 5 (Sv5) (4JF7; 2.50 \u00c5 ; 24%) (Welch et al. 2013) , Nipah virus (NiV) (3D11; 2.31; 22%), Hendra virus (HeV) (2VSK; 2.00; 20%), Measles virus (MeV) (2ZB6; 2.60; 16%). Using available templates a set of initial structural models was created. To assess regions of sequence-structure conservation or variability in the modeled Sendai HN protein an extensive search for similar fragments in other proteins from PDB was performed using the StralSV algorithm (Zemla et al. 2011) , which identifies protein fragments that exhibit structural similarities despite low primary amino acid sequence similarity. Results from these searches were used for modeling of missing loop or termini regions in the constructed preliminary models. For the construction of the final structural model the coordinates from the PDB chain 4mza_B were used as a primary template. The conformation of side-chain atoms was predicted using SCWRL (Krivov, Shapovalov, and Dunbrack 2009 ) when residue-residue correspondences did not match. Residues that were identical in the template and HN protein were copied from the template onto the model. The structural and stereochemical quality of the model was checked using a contact-dot algorithm in the MolProbity software package (Chen et al. 2010) , and the final constructed model was finished with relaxation using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al. 2004) .",

Many different combinations of primers were used in order to amplify as much of the viral genome as possible (Supplementary Table S1 ). To determine if the poor PCR amplification results were due to low numbers of viral genomes present in each sample, viral titers were determined by both plaque assay and Taqman PCR. The average number of positive PCR results per region (best possible score is two primers per region) was compared with the viral titer (PFU/ ml) and to the C t (cycle threshold) average of two replicates. The average C t had a negative correlation with positive PCR results (r \u00bc \u00c00.97), however there was no correlation between PCR outcome and viral titer as determined by plaque assay (r \u00bc \u00c00.35). Number of viral genomes per PCR reaction was estimated using standard curve derived from control SeV plasmid dilutions and values ranged from $800 genomes (sample SD4.P10, PCR score of 0) per PCR reaction to 25 million genomes (FD2.P10, PCR score of 2).

Results showed that these positions are located on the protein surface on the top of the receptor-binding domain next to sialic acid-binding regions and don't overlap with interfaces of the tetramer formation (Fig. 8) . Additionally, the mutation positions are located in the regions identified as variable in sequence according to calculated multiple sequence alignments between HN proteins of paramyxovirus sequences from UniProt.

Also included in the analysis was the leader region, including nt sites 20 and 24 which have been associated with virulence in mice (Fujii et al. 2002) but were not included in the Illumina sequence analysis. Analysis of the plaque genotypes showed that nt 20 of the leader region was mutated from G to A in 27% of the clones, with most of the mutations occurring later in passage. Seventeen percent of clones from P1 had an A present (10/58), whereas by P10 an A was detected in 48% of clones (13/27). After plaque selection and genotyping, twelve clones with sequence that represented high-frequency variants were used to construct populations of single and mixed genotypes for testing in mice (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Eight groups of mice were infected with homogeneous or heterogeneous mixtures of clones (six mixtures were assayed). The egg-passaged seed stock used to infect mice for P1 served as a 'high diversity' control because it contains a full mutant spectrum versus the other inocula that contained one to six clones. Virulence of each inoculum was gauged using weight loss and lung histopathology scores. Infection with the high-diversity seed stock displayed the greatest virulence as compared with the clone mixtures (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. S5 ). An inoculum representing a homogenous preparation of one of the two major genotypes present in the seed stock also had higher virulence as compared with the other clone preparations, although the difference statistically significant for only two of the other inoculums. This clone contained the wild type genotype with an Asp residue in the polymerase gene that was selected for during serial passage (N1124D).",

The presence of Lys at 461 rather than Glu is known to decrease HN neuraminidase activity without affecting binding of the HN protein to the cell receptor. For example, experiments described by Takahashi, Ryan, and Portner (1992) showed that while HN protein of SeV is heat-stable with Lys at 461, it becomes heat-labile when substitutions (Gly or Gln) occur at this position. Position 461 is also associated with virulence in mice, and mutates from a negatively charged residue, Glu, to a nonpolar residue, Gly, in response to passage of an egg-propagated isolate in mouse cells (Kiyotani et al. 2001; Itoh et al. 1992) .

            "text": "Perhaps the most surprising result from this study is the lack of histopathologic lesions in any of the three guinea pigs that were infected with FD.P10 inoculum. Although limited sequencing data were available from these animals, no changes were observed that differentiated FD.GP samples or the FD.P10 from the corresponding samples from the ND and SD groups. However, the combination of amino acids (residues 454, 461, 525) at these three sites is unique for FD.GP1 (the only FD.GP with sequence data for the HN gene). FD.GP1 had HN genotype AKQ (residues 454, 461, 525, respectively), as compared with genotypes AEK and VKQ for the ND.GP and SD.GP samples. Thus, it is possible that it is the unique combination of AKQ that attenuates the virus in guinea pigs. Alternatively other parameters such as temporal aspects of host response may have affected histopathology scores. For example, obesity may result in a delayed pro-inflammatory response to influenza virus infection (Smith et al. 2007) , if this response is also delayed in Sendai infected animals, this may have resulted in decreased histopathology scores in the FD group (Fig. 2C) .",

These studies have primarily focused on malnutrition of the host; however, more recent studies have begun to look at the role obesity plays in infection and immunity (Nieman et al. 1999; Ritz and Gardner 2006; Kanneganti and Dixit 2012) . In this study, we focused on the role malnutrition (in the form of selenium deficiency) and diet induced obesity had in mice infected with SeV to understand the effects these two dietary conditions have on the viral mutant spectra and infection dynamics. Dietinduced obesity has been demonstrated to alter cytokine profiles in mice (Mito et al. 2000) . Consistent with those studies, our studies found altered cytokine profiles in uninfected FD mice compared with SD and ND mice ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). In SeV-infected mice there were no differences found in cytokine expression profiles associated with in vivo passage within The average was calculated using the maximum weight loss over the course of the infection for each mouse infected c Mixture of clones consisted of clones representing genotypes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. The remaining genotypes did not replicate well enough to allow adequate titer. dietary groups; however, further analysis of cytokine profiles between the dietary groups found SD mice infected with SeV had a suppressed immune response compared with ND and FD mice infected with SeV ( Supplementary Fig. S2) . Similarly, mice infected with influenza virus receiving a selenium deficient diet have been shown to have suppressed cytokine profiles compared with mice receiving a ND (Beck et al. 2001 ).",
