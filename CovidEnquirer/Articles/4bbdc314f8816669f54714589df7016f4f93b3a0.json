Despite the changes in immunity, the incidence of respiratory infections is not higher in pregnancy. Asthma is the most common preexisting medical disorder encountered in pregnancy, and its prevalence in women of childbearing age is increasing. There is a slight increase in the risk to the pregnancy, but suboptimal therapy is the most common reason for poor control. Xrays should be obtained whenever clinically indicated, and most drugs used in the management of asthma have a long track record of safety. For women with poor control in pregnancy, there should be good liaison between the respiratory physician and the obstetrician.

The course of asthma in pregnancy in an individual woman is largely unpredictable. Women commencing pregnancy with severe or poorly controlled disease will experience worsening of symptoms, particularly in the third trimester, compared with those with mild disease. There is some evidence that the course of the disease is similar in successive pregnancies. Many asthmatics experience worsening of their symptoms during pregnancy because they stop or reduce medication due to fears (either their own or their medical advisers') about its safety.

Most of this concern is misplaced, and steroids should be used to treat asthma in pregnancy in the same way and for the same reasons as in the nonpregnant state. About 90% of prednisolone is metabolized by the placenta and therefore only small quantities of the active drug reach the fetus. Several studies suggest no increased risk of abortion, stillbirth, congenital malformations, adverse fetal effects or neonatal death attributable to treating the mother with steroids. The maternal adverse effects from steroid therapy in pregnancy include increased risk of infections, reduced glucose tolerance and increased gestational diabetes. The development of hyperglycaemia (treatable with insulin) is not an indication to discontinue or decrease the dose of oral steroids, the requirement for which must be determined by the asthma. The rare, but important, psychiatric side-effects of oral glucocorticoids (with prednisolone X30 mg) should be remembered, and all women who have been commenced on steroids should be reviewed within 1 week.

Drug therapy should be given as for a non-pregnant patient with asthma, including repeat doses of inhaled b2 agonists and early administration of oral steroids. The treatment aim is to maintain the partial pressure of oxygen greater than 60 mmHg and oxygen saturation above 95%. In severe cases, intravenous treatment with magnesium sulphate, b2 agonists or aminophylline can be used as indicated. Continuous fetal assessment should be performed when asthma is uncontrolled or severe, or when the initial assessment is non-reassuring. Acute severe asthma in pregnancy should be considered as an emergency and should be treated vigorously in hospital. Provided abdominal shielding is used, a chest X-ray results in minimal exposure of the fetus to ionizing radiation, and if clinically indicated, this investigation must never be withheld just because the patient is pregnant.",

Rates of preterm birth are high, particularly with low maternal weights, but perinatal mortality is surprisingly low. Sometimes preterm delivery may be medically indicated in unwell women. Therapeutic termination of pregnancy may be required in very sick women, underscoring the need for effective contraception in those not wishing to get pregnant. Should the condition be complicated by CF-related diabetes, the pregnancy outcome is adversely affected. Although the outcome is consistently improving with time, it still remains inferior compared with those without CF-related diabetes. Pregnancy in lung transplant recipients with CF has been reported. Although the data are relatively limited, they seem to agree with the experience with other organ transplants. Rejection of the transplant is more common in the first 2 years, so pregnancy should ideally not be embarked upon during this time.

Withholding appropriate PCP prophylaxis may have an adverse effect on maternal and fetal outcomes. More than 80% of women with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are of reproductive age, and PCP is the most common cause of AIDS-related death in pregnant women in the USA. Among 22 cases recently reviewed in the Division of Infectious Diseases, Brooklyn, New York, USA, the mortality rate was 50% (11 of 22 patients), which is higher than that usually reported for HIV-infected individuals with PCP. Respiratory failure developed in 13 patients (59%), and mechanical ventilation was therefore required; the survival rate in patients requiring mechanical ventilation was 31%. Maternal and fetal outcomes were better in cases of PCP during the third trimester of pregnancy.",

Amphotericin has been widely used without evidence of teratogenicity. The use of fluconazole as a first-line therapy is not recommended due to the risk of fetal malformations. Bacterial pneumonia is more frequent in HIVpositive individuals than in seronegative controls, and the risk is highest among those with CD4 lymphocyte counts below 200/mm 3 and among injection-drug users. There is evidence of a change in the causative organisms of pneumonia in pregnancy. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is becoming a common cause of both community acquired and nosocomial bacterial pneumonia in hospitalized patients with HIV, especially in those with low leukocyte and CD4 \u00fe lymphocyte counts. Although the incidence of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia, as well of other opportunistic infections, decreased considerably with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, it still represents an important cause of mortality.",

Treatment regimens consist of an initial (intensive) phase lasting 2 months. During the initial phase, normally consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, the tubercle bacilli are killed rapidly. This is followed by a continuation phase, usually lasting 4 or 6 months. Patients negative for HIV, with smearnegative pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB that is fully drug susceptible, have little risk of selecting resistant bacilli because their lesions generally harbour fewer bacilli. However, since initial resistance to isoniazid is common in many areas, and HIV testing of tuberculosis patients is not practiced routinely, it is now recommended that ethambutol be included as a fourth drug during the initial phase of treatment for most patients with smear-negative pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. Ethambutol may be omitted for patients with non-cavitary, smear-negative pulmonary TB who are known to be HIV-negative, patients known to be infected with fully drug-susceptible bacilli, and young children with primary TB. Breastfeeding is safe while the mother is receiving antituberculous therapy.",

Most often, patients are asymptomatic, but chest symptoms may occur. Erythema nodosum, arthropathy, fever, hypercalcaemia and central nervous system (CNS) involvement may be the presenting symptoms. It may be associated with an abnormal chest X-ray (Hilar lymphadenopathy) in 30% or erythema nodosum with arthralgia in 30%. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level is used outside pregnancy to monitor disease activity, but is of no use in pregnancy due to the physiological increase in serum ACE levels in pregnancy. Sarcoidosis is usually self-limiting and does not require therapy. There are no risks to the fetus, although placental sarcoid granulomas have been reported. Therapy may be indicated in the event of CNS symptoms or impairment of respiratory function. Systemic steroids are useful for improvement of the disease. If the patient is already on steroids, they should be continued during the pregnancy. The disease course is often unaltered and sometimes improved in pregnancy. Increase in the steroid dosage after delivery should be considered because post-partum relapse is common. Pregnant women with sarcoidosis should avoid vitamin D as this can precipitate hypercalcaemia.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first reported in 2003 in south-east Asia. The causative organism is a new coronavirus that induces symptoms of an atypical pneumonia, but some patients rapidly progress towards adult respiratory distress syndrome. This results in significant hypoxia. The infection may produce a unique set of problems if encountered with pregnancy. It may cause a miscarriage in early pregnancy, IUGR, fetal distress and intra-uterine death. Maternal oxygen saturation should be maintained above 95%, and mothers should be nursed in the upright position. Women on ventilators are best nursed in the left lateral position in order to maximize uteroplacental blood flow. Cardiotocography with ultrasound assessment of fetal growth and Doppler assessment of blood flow are recommended as fetal monitoring measures. SARS is a very contagious disease and appropriate isolation and infection control protocols are necessary in order to avoid accidental infection of the medical staff. A small group of health professionals should be allocated to look after infected patients, and they should be periodically monitored for signs of early infection. The risk of infection is particularly high at the time of vaginal or operative delivery, and additional precautions such as negative pressure air circulation are recommended. Broadspectrum antibiotics (Clarithromycin and co-amoxyclav in pregnancy) are recommended to prevent concomitant bacterial infection. Ribavarin, an antiviral agent, is tried in SARS with clinical deterioration. However, it is a known teratogen in animals, so it should be used in pregnancy with extreme caution. Termination of pregnancy should be recommended in women exposed to this agent in early pregnancy. High doses of steroids are also recommended in sick patients. Bacterial infection as a side-effect of maternal steroid therapy is known, and should be guarded against. SARS virus infection may be particularly severe in pregnancy, and pregnancy termination is an option. Early delivery will reduce the oxygen requirements, and this may be vitally important in critically ill patients. Rapid deterioration, multi-organ failure, fetal compromise and failure to maintain maternal oxygenation, even on ventilator support, along with other obstetric reasons constitute indications for early delivery.",
