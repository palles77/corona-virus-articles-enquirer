Sterile plantlets were cultured in media with different potassium levels, and parameters related to growth, foliar potassium, water and chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis, transpiration, H 2 O 2 contents and antioxidative enzyme activities were determined after a month. Results showed that 1.28 mM potassium was the optimum for H. cordata as highest values of dry weight, shoot height, root length and number were obtained at this concentration. The optimum potassium concentration resulted in the maximum net photosynthetic rate which could be associated with the highest chlorophyll content rather than limited stomatal conductance. The supply of surplus potassium resulted in higher content of foliar potassium, but negatively correlated with the biomass. Both potassium starvation (0 mM) and high potassium (>1.28 mM) could lead to water loss through high transpiration rate and low water absorption, respectively, and resulted in H 2 O 2 accumulation and increased activities of catalase and peroxidase, which suggested induction of oxidative stress. Moreover, H. cordata showed the minimum of H 2 O 2 content and the maximum of superoxide dismutase activity on 1.28 mM potassium, implying its role in inducing tolerance against oxidative stress.",

In recent years farmers are trying to increase its production by artificial cultivation. Being different from field crop plants such as cotton, wheat, maize and rice (Koch and Estes, 1975; Bednarz et al., 1998; Weng et al., 2007; Pettigrew, 2008; Gerardeaux et al., 2010) , only limited information is available about its response towards fertilization formulae. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an efficient fertilization system for its commercial cultivation. However, the effects of different potassium supplement levels on its growth and physiology are largely unknown. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to filter out the optimal supplement level of potassium for H. cordata growth by investigating its effects on growth, plant K concentrations, water contents, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis, transpiration, H 2 O 2 contents and antioxidative enzyme activities.",

In the present study, H. cordata plants acquired highest values of dry weight, shoot height, root length and number on 1.28 mM K, and as such represented the most favourable treatment for its growth and development. Potassium starvation, as well as its surplus, caused severe reduction in its growth and development. The length and surface area of root affected the range of nutrient absorption, having direct negative consequences on plant productivity (Cakmak, 2005; Hermans et al., 2006; Pettigrew, 2008) . Therefore, the decreases in dry weight and shoot height of H. cordata were partly due to similar changes of root length and number. Moreover, although the supply of surplus potassium resulted in higher contents of foliar potassium as compared to 1.28 mM K, the higher leaf K did not improve the biomass. This might contribute to a hypothesis that plant probably needs critical cytoplasmic concentration of K in a certain range (Leigh and Wyn Jones, 1984) .",

It is well known that photosynthesis is related to carbon assimilation and dry matter production (Gifford and Evans, 1981; Kramer, 1981; Zelitch, 1982) and that chlorophyll content, chloroplast ultrastructure and stomatal conductance are the major factors in photosynthetic rate (Farquhar and Sharkey, 1982; Zhao et al., 2001) , However, the optimum concentration of potassium in the present study did not show an increase in the stomatal conductance, and wrinkled leaves as observed in the treatments of potassium starvation and high potassium might be due to water loss and therefore represent poor chloroplast ultrastructure (not measured in this study). Many studies have shown that appropriate potassium concentration can enhance chlorophyll content and photophosphorylase activity and maintain chloroplast inner membrane and proton gradient of thylakoid membranes, promoting photosynthetic phosphorylation (V\u00e9ry and Sentenac, 2003; Yurtseven et al., 2005; Chartzoulakis et al., 2006; Hermans et al., 2006) .

            "text": "Appropriate potassium concentration could maintain a critical water content in H. cordata. It is well known that potassium plays an important role in controlling stomatal aperture because concentration gradient of potassium between inside and outside of stomatal guard cells affects solute potential (Fischer, 1968; Fischer and Hsiao, 1968 ). In the present study the optimum concentration of potassium showed lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rate than potassium starvation, resulting in higher water content, which is important for cell functions. However, although the stomata conductance and transpiration rate of the four treatments with potassium were found at par with each other, high potassium resulted in lower water content as compared to 1.28 mM K. This suggested that high potassium reduced water absorption. Oxidative stress could be induced by potassium starvation and high potassium according to the increase in H 2 O 2 content (Fig. 2a) . This result is well in accordance with some other studies (Cakmak, 1994 (Cakmak, , 2005 Shin and Schachtman, 2004) . Excess H 2 O 2 is harmful primarily due to reaction with lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids thus resulting in lipid peroxidation, membrane leakage, enzyme inactivation, and DNA breaks or mutations (Romero-Puertas et al., 2007) , chlorophyll destruction (Cakmak, 1994) and growth reduction (Molassiotis et al., 2006) . The increased activity of CAT and POD as observed in the present study might be to protect biomolecules from being attacked by H 2 O 2 . However, SOD activity did not show an increase with potassium starvation and high potassium. Previous studies have demonstrated that oxygen-dependence photosynthesis may be \"leaking\" energy to molecular oxygen, forming ROS such as \u2022 O 2 - (Wise and Naylor, 1987; Ort and Baker, 2002) . It therefore was suggested that accumulation of \u2022 O 2 might be partially suppressed by the low photosynthesis rates in these treatments. All of these implied that potassium starvation and high potassium might not result in an increase of \u2022 O 2 and excess H 2 O 2 should have accumulated from other sources rather than from the conversion of \u2022 O 2 to H 2 O 2 . Moreover, the minimum of H 2 O 2 content and the maximum of SOD activity at 1.28 mM K suggested that the optimal level of potassium resulted in lower oxidative stress and endowed plants with the resistance against oxidative stress, respectively.",
