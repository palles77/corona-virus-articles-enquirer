            "text": "Background: A number of antiviral therapies have evolved that may be effectively administered to treat respiratory viral diseases. But these therapies are very often of limited efficacy or have severe side effects. Therefore there is great interest in developing new efficacious and safe antiviral compounds e.g. based on the identification of compounds of herbal origin. Hypothesis: Since an aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens Mill. shows antiviral activity against viruses causing infections of the upper respiratory tract in vitro we hypothesised that a product containing it such as Biaron C \u00ae could have an antiviral activity too. Study design: Antiviral activity of Bioaron C \u00ae , an herbal medicinal product consisting of an aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens Mill., Vitamin C, and Aronia melanocarpa Elliot. succus, added as an excipient, was tested in vitro against a broad panel of viruses involved in upper respiratory tract infections. Methods: These studies included human adenovirus and several RNA viruses and were performed either with plaque reduction assays or with tests for the detection of a virus-caused cytopathic effect. Results: Our studies demonstrated an impressive activity of Bioaron C \u00ae against members of the orthomyxoviridae -influenza A and influenza B viruses. Replication of both analysed influenza A virus strains -H1N1 and H3N2 -as well as replication of two analysed influenza B viruses -strains Yamagatal and Beiying -was significantly reduced after addition of Bioaron C \u00ae to the infected cell cultures. In contrast antiviral activity of Bioaron C \u00ae against other RNA viruses showed a heterogeneous pattern. Bioaron C \u00ae inhibited the replication of human rhinovirus and coxsackievirus, both viruses belonging to the family of picornaviridae and both representing non-enveloped RNA viruses. In vitro infections with respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus, both belonging to the paramyxoviridae, were only poorly blocked by the test substance. No antiviral activity of Bioaron C \u00ae was detected against adenovirus -a non-enveloped DNA virus. Conclusions: These results represent the first proof of a selective antiviral activity of Bioaron C \u00ae against influenza viruses and create basis for further analyses of type and molecular mechanisms of the antiviral activity of this herbal medicine.",

(Araliaceae), against human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus, which was discussed as RNAvirus specific reactivity. Michaelis et al. (2011) investigated the influence of a standardised extract of Pelargonium sidoides DC. (Geraniaceae), for the treatment of acute bronchitis, on replication of a panel of respiratory viruses. The authors were able to show that concentrations up to 100 \u03bcg/ml interfered with replication of seasonal influenza A virus strains (H1N1, H3N2), RSV, human coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, and coxsackie virus but did not affect replication of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1), adenovirus, or HRV.",

For non-enveloped viruses HRV14 (responsible for the majority of acute respiratory infections in both children and adults) and coxsackievirus type 9 (CA9 -tend to infect the skin and mucous membranes, causing herpangina, acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and hand-foot-and-mouth (HFM) disease) were included in the analyses.

The natural habitats of A. arborescens are mountainous regions of Southern Africa. A. arborescens is also grown as a source material for medicinal, cosmetic, and food uses in various countries (China, Israel, Italy, Japan, Poland (green houses), and in Ukraine (Crimea peninsula)) (Jambor 2012) . Plants used for this study were cultivated and harvested in a greenhouse plantation by Phytopharm Kl\u0119ka S.A., in Poland.",

The EC50 concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 1.16% when used in three independent studies (mean EC50 0.91% study 1-3, Table 2 ). Besides its antiviral effect against HRV 14 Bioaron C \u00ae was tested against another member of the picornaviridae, the nonenveloped plus strand RNA virus: coxsackievirus subtype A9 (CA9). Bioaron C \u00ae was a little bit less effective on CA9-infected cells compared to HRV 14 infections but its activity still resulted in a 67.9% (mean of two studies, 56.4% (study 1), 79.3% (study 2), Fig. 3b ) plaquereduction at its highest concentration and a clear dose-dependent reactivity with an EC50 ranging between 1.0% and 1.75% in two different experiments (Table 2) . Besides the reactivity of Bioaron C \u00ae against non-enveloped RNA viruses of further interest was the reactivity against other RNA as well as DNA viruses. Therefore the reactivity of Bioaron C \u00ae was studied against Para 3 and RSV; both viruses belonging to enveloped RNA viruses of the paramyxoviridae family ( Fig. 4a and b , respectively). Against both viruses Bioaron C \u00ae showed only a very moderate antiviral activity. Its effect against Para 3 in his highest concentration ranged in three independent experiments from 24.3% to 41.7% (Fig. 4a) , but was obviously reduced with further dilutions, and a 0.5% Bioaron C \u00ae solution did not show any antiviral activity. Therefore the EC50 could be only estimated for solutions with more than 2% (Table 2) . Less pronounced antiviral activity could be demonstrated against RSV (Fig. 4b) .",

Interestingly, only a reduced reactivity was visible against members of the paramyxoviridae representing also enveloped RNA viruses which are closely related to the orthomyxoviridae. This is somehow unexpected because most of the antiviral extracts analysed so far showed similar activities against these two virus families. This was shown for extracts from E. senticosus (Glatthaar-Saalm\u00fcller et al. 2001) , P. sidoides (Michaelis et al. 2011) and a composition of different plant extracts derived from Gentian root, Primula flower, Elder flower, Sorrel herb, and Verbena herb (Glatthaar-Saalm\u00fcller et al. 2011) . The active substance of Bioaron C \u00ae : the aqueous extract of A. arborecens is therefore unique in its orthomyxovirus-specific reactivity.

            "text": "Analysing the outstanding efficacy of Bioaron C \u00ae against influenza viruses we may conclude that a major gap in antiviral treatment can be covered after further research. So far two classes of synthetic anti-influenza drugs have been described: inhibitors of the M2 ion channel (e.g., amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., osteltamivir and zanamivir). Since increasing resistances to these drugs are reported while the clinical efficacy of the neuraminidase inhibitors has been seriously questioned only recently by a Cochrane review (Jefferson et al. 2014 ) and also discussed (Leibovici and Paul 2014) there is an urgent need to introduce additional, reliable anti-influenza-virus agents. Won et al. (2013) described some plant extracts derived from Thuja orientalis Franco., Cuppresaceae, Aster spathulifolius Maxim., Asteraceae, and Pinus thunbergii Parl., Pinaceae, with antiviral activity against influenza A viruses in vitro but did not further characterise these extracts. An extract from Ribes nigrum L., Grossulariaceae, leaves was described recently (Ehrhardt et al. 2013 ) with a high anti-influenza potential which seems to interfere with virus internalisation. In regard to the functional mechanism of Bioaron C \u00ae we can only speculate that we are dealing with a similar antiviral mechanism. Rajasekaaran et al. (2013) made an impressive study with 50 extracts from plants of the tropical rain forest of Borneo. The authors were able to identify eleven crude extracts inhibiting the enzymatic activity of the viral neuraminidase and four of them were also able to show inhibition of haemagglutination. These extracts have to be further investigated, standardised and purified, however.",
