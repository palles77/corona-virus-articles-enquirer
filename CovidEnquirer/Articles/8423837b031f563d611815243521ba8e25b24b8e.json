However, past studies have not yet incorporated the effects of air travel on the transmission of influenza in the construction of mathematical epidemic models. Therefore, this paper focused on the human-to-human transmission of influenza, and investigated the effects of air travel activities on an influenza pandemic in a small-world network. These activities of air travel include passengers' consolidation, conveyance and distribution in airports and flights. Dynamic transmission models were developed to assess the expected burdens of the pandemic, with and without control measures. This study also investigated how the small-world properties of an air transportation network facilitate the spread of influenza around the globe. The results show that, as soon as the influenza is spread to the top 50 global airports, the transmission is greatly accelerated. Under the constraint of limited resources, a strategy that first applies control measures to the top 50 airports after day 13 and then soon afterwards to all other airports may result in remarkable containment effectiveness. As the infectiousness of the disease increases, it will expand the scale of the pandemic, and move the start time of the pandemic ahead.",

            "text": "In recent years emerging infectious diseases, such as the avian influenza, the 2009 swine flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have rapidly caused many infected cases in humans, negatively affecting human life and the economy. For example, SARS led to an immediate economic loss of close to 2% of the GDP for the East Asian region in the second quarter of 2003 (Brahmbhatt, 2005) . Avian influenza virus H5N1 is a potentially serious pandemic threat to the human population (Ferguson et al., 2005) . H5N1 may transform into a new human influenza virus through genetic reassortment, and develop the ability for increased and sustained transmission between humans (Capua and Alexander, 2002) , possibly being as virulent as it is in the avian population. Most people are easily infected with this new type of influenza because they possibly have no immunity to the emerging disease. In addition, there is no vaccine available that provides effective protection against infection once the disease appears (Ligon, 2005) , thereby resulting in a serious pandemic and then obstructing social and economic activities worldwide. Over the past decades, there have been a few influenza pandemics that spread over the entire globe. The most noted influenza pandemic was the one beginning in 1918 with a mortality rate that resulted in the death of possibly 50 million people worldwide (Ligon, 2005) . Influenza pandemics are a serious health threat. It is critical that one understands how an emerging influenza spreads, how to predict the result of a pandemic, and how to design control measures to mitigate the impacts of the disease.",

            "text": "A previous study of SARS indicated that passengers who took the same airplane flight with a SARS patient would possibly become suspect or probable cases of SARS (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003) . Another study also indicated a high rate of transmission of SARS on aircraft (Olsen et al., 2003) . These findings show that air travel facilitates the spread of infectious diseases. Although the influence of air travel has been observed in empirical work, past studies that developed mathematical epidemic models have rarely explored this topic, particularly for an emerging influenza. The aim of this study is to help close this gap in the literature. This paper is different from past studies in that it aimed to explore the transmission of an emerging human influenza via air travel, and evaluate its dynamical evolution and spatial distribution in a small-world 1 airline network. We focused on the human-tohuman transmission of influenza, and analyzed the effects of air travel activities, including passengers' consolidation, conveyance and distribution in airports and flights, on the influenza pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to develop dynamic transmission models to illustrate the transmission behaviors of the influenza virus in scheduled flights and airport terminals. For the realism of our models, links of the network were weighted by the flying time and the number of passengers, and different values of the infection parameters were designed for flights and airports. We also attempted to investigate how the influenza spreads to different geographic regions based on the connectivity properties of the small-world network. In order to provide helpful insights, the proposed models were further used to assess the expected burden of the influenza pandemic in the absence of control measures, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of performing the control measures proposed by the present study.",

For example, Ferguson et al. (2005) modeled the spread of a pandemic in Thailand by incorporating random contacts associated with dayto-day movements to work within the country, and then evaluated the potential effectiveness of containment strategies. In addition, numerous studies have proposed mathematical epidemic models to evaluate and describe the dynamic evolution and the severity of epidemics in the population (e.g. Allen and Burgin, 2000; Colizza et al., 2006 Colizza et al., , 2007 Massad et al., 2005; M\u00e9ndez and Fort, 2000) , as well as in small-world networks following the work of Watts and Strogatz (1998) (e.g. Kuperman and Abramson, 2001; Saram\u00e4ki and Kaski, 2005; Small and Tse, 2005) . For example, Colizza et al. (2006 Colizza et al. ( , 2007 developed a metapopulation stochastic epidemic model on a global scale, and used a stochastic transport operator to describe the dynamics of individuals based on travels between cities. They concluded that a cooperative strategy where countries with large antiviral stockpiles share a part of their resources with other countries results in a global deceleration of the pandemics. However, our study focuses on exploring the influences of air travel activities (i.e. passenger consolidation, conveyance and distribution) and small-world properties of an air transportation network on the spatiotemporal evolution of an influenza pandemic. Few of the previous studies have discussed these issues in detail.",

Previous studies (Industrial Technology Research Institute, 2005; Zhang, 2005) have recently shown that H5N1 may transmit the influenza virus during the incubation period. As a result, this study applies the susceptible-infected (SI) epidemic model to investigate the transmission of influenza, where the population is partitioned into two possible states, susceptible (S), and infected (I) with infectiousness. There are three assumptions in the transmission model: (1) the influenza is transmitted by contact between an infected individual and a susceptible individual; (2) all susceptible individuals are equally susceptible and all infected individuals are equally infectious; and (3) each individual is initially susceptible to the influenza except for several individuals who are already infected. The first two assumptions are referred to Frauenthal (1980) . Once a susceptible individual is infected, she/he becomes an infected individual. The proposed transmission model is derived as follows.",

The small-world properties improve the connectivity efficiency of the airline network in two aspects. One is that the properties shorten passengers' travel time by introducing several inter-regional or inter-continental routes that mimic the function of shortcuts in a small-world network. They enable passengers to fly between airports that are located at different regions in an efficient way. The other is that the properties expand the destinations that passengers can reach by scheduled flights, i.e. passengers can further transfer to downstream flights in order to fly to other regions around the globe after they arrive at connecting airports. Nevertheless, the improved connectivity of the airline network contributed by the small-world properties also speeds up the transmission of the influenza in the network. In the absence of inter-regional routes, the infected individuals have a longer travel time for arriving at their destination airports, thereby slowing down the transmission of the influenza to these airports. However, by introducing the inter-regional routes, the flying time of infected individuals, F j , can be substantially shortened. This makes the arrival time,t j , earlier than before, and as shown in Eq. (8), advances the time at which X j d (t) > 0, i.e. the influenza is transmitted more rapidly to the destination airports. It further makes I(t) of the transmission model in Eq. (10) increase more quickly. On the other hand, although the small-world properties expand the number of destinations that passengers can reach, the fact that the destination airports of flights are different from one another enables the infected individuals to spread the influenza to various regions worldwide via flights. In other words, the improved connectivity contributed by small-world properties expands the geographic scope of transmission, i.e. H(t) in Eq. (11).",

They used several methods to screen arrival and departure passengers, including visual inspection to detect symptoms and thermal scanning at international borders (e.g. airports and seaports). This study further designs a control measure to be carried out in airports to constrain the transmission of influenza and reduce its impacts. The control measure is that, the customs and public health officers must inspect all departure passengers at the entrances of restricted areas by such methods as temperature screening. Passengers will be quarantined as soon as their influenza symptoms are identified. This control measure will effectively reduce the possibility that infected individuals will board flights. That is, it decreases the initial number of infected individuals on flights at the departure time, I o j , and consequently, as shown in Eq. (4), diminishes the number of infected individuals on flights, I j (t). As a result, practicing the control measure mentioned above can reduce I(t) of the transmission model in Eq.

This then results in a higher infected probability and a more serious transmission of the influenza within the restricted area. We compare the total number of passengers of all airports according to the statistics published by Airports Council International (ACI). 2 And then, for the airport that has the greatest number of passengers we take j d = 0.085 (per infected individual per hour). Subsequently, for each of the other airports the value of j d is adjusted downward from 0.085 according to the relative ratio of its number of passengers to the greatest number of passengers on an airport. Finally, based on the data and the parameters mentioned above, we simulate the transmission of the influenza in the small-world network, and evaluate its dynamic evolution and spatial distribution. World Bank (2005) said that the avian flu virus could be carried to any region by wild birds or by illegal trade, leading to genetic reassortment and the start of a human flu pandemic in such region.

As shown in Fig. 1(a) , the number of infected individuals increases rapidly after day 30, and the daily increased number of infected individuals continues to increase over time. Specifically, the daily increased number of infected individuals on day 43 is approximately 20,000 persons. This result is similar to that found in Ferguson et al. (2005) 3 where the daily number of increased cases on day 43 is over 10,000 persons in Thailand, confirming the reasonableness of the result in our study. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1(b) , the percentage of airports with infected cases increases at an increasing rate, showing both the dynamic evolution and the spatial distribution of the influenza transmission. It also indicates that influenza can spread to other regions all over the world and then increase its geographic scope of transmission at an escalating rate. Since the number of passengers in airport terminals will affect the influenza transmission, we shall further focus on those airports with numbers of passengers ranked among the top 50 airports worldwide. With other words, we will focus on the pattern of transmission generated by flights whose destinations are the top 50 airports. As shown in Fig. 2 , if the destinations of flights that have infected cases are the top 50 airports, then the transmission pattern generated by them will be more serious than the average pattern. This indicates that as soon as the influenza spreads to the top 50 airports, it will accelerate the transmission and result in a larger pandemic. 4 We then evaluate the influence of control measures on the influenza transmission. When a new strain of influenza appears, people do not immediately recognize the disease for what it is. It may take some time to develop an effective method to detect and respond to it. Considering this initial slow reaction, and the fact that the number of infected individuals increases rapidly after day 30, this study will use the two control measures mentioned above being carried out in all airports after day 30 as an analysis scenario to investigate their effects. As shown in Fig. 3 , after day 30 both the daily increased number of infected individuals and the daily increased percentage of airports with infected cases are markedly reduced by these control measures. It indicates that the transmission can be effectively mitigated by the practice of control measures.",

As a result, we further investigate the transmission pattern in a situation where the control measures cannot be carried out synchronously for all airports. In the network, such large airports as the top 50 airports have a higher level of network connectivity, but there are fewer large than small airports. So, practicing the control measures at large or small airports may receive different priorities and thereby obtain different containment results. In order to determine which set of priorities results in better containment effectiveness, this study designs various strategies to give different priorities of execution for the control measures based on the size of the airports. Strategies practiced in this study are shown in Table 1 , and are described as follows. Strategy 1 stipulates that all airports synchronously carry out the control measures after day 30. Strategy 2 stipulates that the top 50 airports first carry out the control measures after day 30, while other airports execute measures with some time delay due to the constraint of limited resources. It is assumed that these airports will start their control measures 5 days later, i.e. day 35. Contrary to Strategy 2, Strategy 3 stipulates that those airports excluded from the top 50 first carry out control measures after day 30, but that the top 50 airports start executing the control measures after day 35 due to different concerns at various sizes of airports. The results are shown in Fig. 4 , indicating that Strategy 1 is the most effective approach for containing the influenza transmission and the pandemic. In addition, Strategy 2 is the second most effective approach with a transmission pattern that is slightly higher than that of Strategy 1. This observation may be helpful in providing an insight to public health authorities, particularly when practicing control measures with limited resources. Compared to Strategy 2, we also run the simulations for carrying out control measures at the top 10, top 20, top 30 airports and so on, and finally at the top 100 airports. The results show that the transmission pattern gradually decreases as the top number increases from 10 to 100. However, as the top number increases over 50, the decrement of the transmission pattern is slight and limited. So 50 can be regarded as a critical number for the choice of the top number of airports in the practice of control measures.",

So, we then attempt to start practicing three different strategies after day 13, which give different priorities in executing the control measures according to the size of the airports. This allows us to assess their containment effectiveness and to examine which set of priorities is better for containing the transmission. The different strategies are shown in Table 1 , and are described as follows. Strategy 4 stipulates that all airports must synchronously carry out the control measures after day 13. Strategy 5 stipulates that the top 50 airports must first carry out control measures after day 13, and then the other airports start to execute the control measures with 5 days delay, i.e. on day 18.

Empirical investigations have found that air travel facilitates the spread of infectious diseases. However, past studies of mathematical epidemic models have not yet incorporated the effects of air travel on influenza transmission. This paper focused on the human-to-human transmission of influenza, and investigated the effects of air travel activities (passengers' consolidation, conveyance and distribution in airports and flights) on the influenza pandemic in a small-world network. Dynamic transmission models were developed not only to illus-trate the transmission behaviors of the influenza en route scheduled flights and in airport terminals, but also to assess the expected burdens of the pandemic with and without control measures. This study also investigated how the small-world properties of the airline network facilitate the spread of influenza over all parts of the globe.",

Those flights to the top 50 airports spread the disease more quickly than the same number of flights to all airports. Our findings suggest that the public health authorities should avoid the influenza being spread to the top 50 airports in order to mitigate the impacts of the influenza. Under the constraint of limited resources, control at the top 50 airports first is almost as effective as control at all airports, and control sooner is more effective than control later. The findings may be helpful in providing insights for public health authorities to set priorities. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that as the infectiousness of the influenza increases, the disease spreads more quickly, and the start time of the pandemic is earlier. This means that, once the influenza increases in strength or becomes stronger than expected, the authorities should move the start of the control measures ahead accordingly in order to effectively control the pandemic. However, control measures at larger airports, such as the top 50 airports, are more expensive than at smaller airports. One could consider involving the cost of control measures and its effects for future research.",
