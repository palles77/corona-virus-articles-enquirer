However, its possible role in completing the process of chain transfer (see Singer, S. J., P. A. Maher, and M. P. Yaffe. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987. 84:1015-1019) has remained elusive. In this work we show that the p62 protein of Semliki Forest virus contains an uncleaved signal sequence at its NH2-terminus and that this becomes glycosylated early during synthesis and translocation of the p62 polypeptide. As the glycosylation of the signal sequence most likely occurs after its release from the ER membrane our results suggest that this region has no role in completing the transfer process.",

            "text": "IOSYNTHESIS of proteins at the ER can be subdivided into several steps. These are (a) targeting of translation complexes to the ER membrane; (b) synthesis and transfer (translocation) of the polypeptide chain across the lipid bilayer; and (c) protein maturation in the lumen of ER (chain folding, disulphide bridge formation, glycosylation, and oligomerization). The mechanisms for these processes have been studied extensively during recent years (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985; Wickner and Lodish, 1985; Rapoport, 1986; Lodish, 1988; Rothman, 1989) . A most important finding has been that all proteins made at the ER carry a signal sequence (also called signal peptide), a hydrophobic peptide which is usually located at the NH2-terminal region of the polypeptide chain. One function of the signal peptide is to achieve targeting of the polysome to the ER membrane (Rapoport, 1986) . When the signal sequence emerges from the ribosome it binds to the signal recognition particle, which mediates binding of the polysome to the docking protein in the ER. After this another function of the signal sequence is expressed, that is to interact with some components of the ER membrane and thereby initiate translocation of the polypeptide chain into the lumen of the ER (Gilmore and Blobel, 1985; Robinson et al., 1987; Wiedmann et al., 1987) . Further synthesis of the polypeptide then continues with concomitant chain translocation. An important but as yet unresolved question is whether the signal sequence has any role in the translocation process per se or whether its functions are limited to the targeting and translocation-initiation steps. For instance, Singer and co-workers Danny Huylebroeck's present address is Innogenetics, Industriepark 7, Box 4, B-9710, Ghent, Belgium.",

We describe the characteristics and behavior of the uncleaved signal sequence of the p62 protein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) l upon translocation across the ER membrane in vitro. The p62 protein is one subunit of the heterodimeric spike protein of the SFV membrane (reviewed in Garoff et al., 1982) . It is made as a precursor protein together with the other structural proteins of SFV, i.e., the nucleocapsid protein, C, and the other spike subunit, El. The three proteins are synthesized from a 4.1-kb long mRNA in the order C, p62, and El, and separated by cleavage of the growing precursor chain. During synthesis of the p62 polypeptide at the ER all but a 31 residue COOH-terminal portion and the membrane anchor is translocated across the membrane. The p62 signal sequence has so far been only roughly localized to the NH2-terminal third of the polypeptide chain (Garoffet al., 1978; Bonatti et al., 1984) . We show here that the signal sequence of p62 consists of a 16 residue peptide at its NH2-terminal region. This region includes one out of four glycosylation sites (Asn~3) for N-linked oligosaccharide on the p62 chain. We also demonstrate that the glycosylation of the p62 signal sequence occurs early during chain translocation. As this modification of the signal region most likely correlates with its release into the lumen of ER it follows that the signal sequence of p62 is probably only needed for an initial step in chain translocation and not to",

In vitro translation reactions using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate were performed at 30\u00b0C essentially as described . 1.5 #1 of the in vitro synthesized RNA was translated in a total volume of 15 #1. Potassium, magnesium, and spermidine concentrations were 100, 1.2, and 0.375 mM, respectively. When indicated, 1 #1 of ER membranes was included. In some translocations the membranes were pretreated with 200 #M peptide for 5 min on ice. The final peptide concentration in the total translation mixture here was, after addition of the pretreated membranes, adjusted to 100/~M. To obtain partial synchronization of translation, ATA was added after a preincubation of 1.5-3.0 rain (Borgese et al., 1974) . A final ATA concentration of 0.075 mM was found to be sufficient for inhibiting initiation of chain synthesis (see control in Fig. 6 , lane/). Higher concentrations of ATA inhibited first transloeation and then also chain elongation. For protease protection experiments, proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml and the samples were incubated at 0*C for 30 min in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of PMSF (final concentration 2 mg/ml) and samples were kept at 0*C for 5 min before further processing for electrophoresis (Cutler and Garoff, 1986) . Bands containing labeled protein were visualized by fluorography. Quantitation of proteins was done by cutting the bands out of the dried gel, solubilizing them with Protosol (from DuPont de Nemours, NEN) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, and finally counting the 3~S radioactivity in a liquid scintillator (Wallac LKB, Turku, Finland). The localization of the bands on the dried gel was done with the aid of the fluorograph in transillumination.",

An Xho I site, allowing subsequent in-frame ligations of SFV sequences, had to be introduced in pGEM2alphaG. Therefore, this plasmid was cut (upstream of the Nco I site) with Sac I, the 3' sticky ends removed with \"1\"4 DNA Folymerase, an Xho I octamer linker introduced and, after cutting with Xho I, the plasmid was religated at low DNA concentration (1 #g/ml).

In this experiment a 150-#1 translation was initiated. After 1.5 rain ATA was added (0.075 raM) to block additional starting of chain synthesis. Then, at 0.5-rain intervals, two 7.5/~1 aliquots were removed; one for mixing with 40 #1 of hot PAGE sample buffer (2 % SDS) and the other one for further incubation after mixing with 0.75/~1 of 20% TX-100. The first sample from each time point was used for the determination of the time needed for chain completion, which is a function of the translation rate, and the other one allowed determination of the time course of glycosylation of the translocated chain. Triton X-100 solubilizes the microsomal membranes and thereby inactivates glycosylation (but not chain elongation). Therefore, only those p62-dhfr chains that have presented Asnl3 tO the glycosylation machinery before TX-100 addition have had the possibility to become glycosylated. In Fig. 5, lanes 1-10, one can see that completed p62dhfr chains (197 residues with initiator Met) appear after a 3-min incubation from the time point of ATA addition. If one assumes constant chain initiation during the Figure 5 . Time course of p62 dhfr glycosylation. A 150-#1 translation was initiated. After a preincubation time of 1.5 min ATA was added to inhibit further initiation of chain synthesis. Then, at intervals of 0.5 min (indicated by 0.5', 1.0', 1.5', 2.0', 2.5', 3.0', 3.5', 4.0', 4.5', and 5.0') two 7.5-/zl samples were removed, one for mixing with PAGE sample buffer and another one for mixing with TX-100 (final concentration 1%) and further incubation at 30\u00b0C (for a total time of 20 min after ATA addition as indicated by the lower row of time points in the figure) . Lanes 1-10 show the samples removed for mixing with the PAGE sample buffer. From these results the approximate rate of translation can be derived. Completed chains appear in the 3-min sample. Lanes 11-20 show the samples in which the membranes have been solubilized with Triton X-100 for inactivation of the glycosylation machinery. From these analyses it is possible to estimate when Asn13 is modified during p62-dhfr synthesis. The first glycosylated forms are clearly visible in the 1.5-min sample, a time point where only about half of the p62-dhfr chain has been synthesized. The nature of the material in the two weak bands seen in lanes 1-5 is unclear. Their transient appearance before the completion of the p62-dhfr chain suggests that they represent complexes of nascent p62-dhfr chains. Figure 6 . Time course of p62 d-4 glycosylation. Seven translations in the presence of microsomal membranes were started in parallel. After a 3-rain initial incubation at 30\u00b0C, ATA was added in order to inhibit further initiation of chain synthesis. Incubation was then continued for 35 rain. At the indicated time points (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 , and 35 rain) TX-100 (TX) was added to stop further chain glycosylation. At the same time one half of each sample was removed and put on ice in order to measure the extent of chain elongation at each time point. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10%) and autoradiography. Lanes 3-9 show the analysis of the samples incubatedwith TX-100 and lanes 10--16 the analysis of the portions put on ice at the different time points. The complete sequence of treatments for each sample is indicated by the labeling in each lane (upper row of time points indicate TX-100 addition and cooling on ice, respectively; lower row of timepoints indicate incubation in the presence of TX-100). Lanes I and 2 represent controls. In the experiment shown in lane I, ATA was added before starting a 40-rain membrane-supplemented translation.",

Fig. 6 (lanes 3-16) shows the time course of the four glycosylation events during C-p62 d-4 translation. A slightly different protocol was followed in this experiment as compared to that with p62-dhfr. Seven translations were initiated in parallel and after a 3-min incubation these were put on ice and ATA was added. Elongation of the already initiated chains was then continued for a total of 35 min, however, so that Triton X-100 was added to individual samples at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 min. At these time points half of each sample was also removed and translation stopped by cooling on ice. Lanes 3-9 show the SDS-PAGE of the samples that had received Triton X-100 at different time points. We found the sequential appearance of p62 d-4 polypeptides with no carbohydrate (lane 3), with one and two units added (seen as two new bands with slower migration in lanes 4 and 5), with three units (lane 6), and all four sugar units (lanes 7, 8, and 9 ) attached to the protein backbone as the translation proceeded coordinately with time. Note that the four glycosylation events result in different degrees of increase of the size of p62 d-4. The second event causes the largest increase and the third one the smallest. As the sugar unit added at each step should be the same we think that these differences reflect some conformational changes in the p62 folding which occur coordinately with glycosylation.",

As expected, we see a sequential appearance of first the capsid The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 111, 1990 protein (in the 10-min sample) and then the p62 d-4 protein (barely visible in the 20-min sample). The p62 d-4 protein is partly present in its glycosylated and partly in its unglycosylated form. Using 21.5 min as a rough estimate for the translation time of the 746 residue long C-p62 d-4 chain (time point of p62 d-4 detection, 20 min, plus half of the 3-min preincubation time without ATA) we have calculated the translation rate and derived the approximate earliest time points when the four glycosylation sites of p62 d-4 should be available for modification. According to these, Asn~ and Asn60 should be the only sites available for glycosylation in the 10-min sample, shown in lane 4, and the most abundant ones presented for modification in the 15-min sample, shown in lane 5. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume that those chains of these two samples which have obtained two sugar units carry these on the aforementioned two sites. Thus, the peptide region with Asn,a seems to be target for rapid modification also when present in its normal background, that is with the p62 protein.",

            "text": "The fact that the 40 residue fragment of the NH2-terminal region of the p62 protein is able to translocate two different reporter molecules into microsomes constitutes in our mind convincing evidence for signal sequence activity in this protein fragment. A more precise location of the p62 signal sequence within the 40 residue p62 fragment can be done with the aid of the known consensus features of a signal sequence. The most typical characteristic of a signal sequence is a stretch of 10-12 uncharged residues, mostly hydrophobic ones (von Heijne, 1985) . This part of the signal sequence probably forms an alpha helix in the ER membrane (Emr and Silhavy, 1983; Briggs et al., 1985 Briggs et al., , 1986 Kendall et al., 1986; Batenburg et al., 1988) . The only possible candidate region within the 40 residue p62 fragment having these features is the 13 residue segment between Pro 3 and Pro 17 (see box in uppermost sequence in Fig. 7) . The Pro-rich region in the middle of the 40 residue fragment would not form an alpha-helix, and the COOH-terminal part of the p62 segment contains a high number of charged residues. As shown in Fig. 7 these features are conserved in all those alphaviruses where the p62 protein has been sequenced. Thus, we find the experimental results, together with the structural considerations discussed above, highly indicative that the 16 NH2terminal residues of p62 constitute its signal sequence.",

In addition, it is known from physical studies using synthetic signal peptides and artificial lipid membranes that the signal peptides readily insert into the membrane and there obtain an alpha-helical conformation (Briggs et al., 1985 (Briggs et al., , 1986 Batenburg et al., 1988; Cornell et al., 1989) . If the p62 signal sequence adapts such an orientation and conformation in the ER membrane it would mean that the glycosylation site at Asnt3 would locate inside the membrane (von Heijne, 1985) . In this location the site can hardly be accessible for the glycosylation machinery. (Note that in the related Ross River virus, the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus the corresponding glycosylation site is even closer towards the NH2terminus, that is at Asn 11, see Fig. 7 .) According to several recent studies, glycosylation requires the exposure of the glycosylation site in the lumen of ER. Firstly, it has been shown that the binding protein for the glycosylation site of N-linked oligosaccharides is a lumenal 57-kD protein of the ER (Geetha-Habib et al., 1988) . Secondly, one study with the asialoglycoprotein receptor and another one with the Corona virus E1 membrane protein demonstrate that lumenally oriented glycosylation sites are not used on transmembrane polypeptides if they locate very close to the membranebinding segments of the chains (Mayer et al., 1988; Wessels and Spiess, 1988) . In the case of the asialoglycoprotein receptor a site was not used if located 12 residues apart from the membrane anchor, however, if moved 8 more residues apart from the anchor it became glycosylated. In the case of the Corona virus protein a site just adjacent to the combined signal sequence-anchor peptide remained unglycosylated, whereas an engineered site 24 residues further away was used for glycosylation. Such restrictions in glycosylation are most likely to be explained by sterical problems in attaching the very spacious sugar unit (Lee et al., 1984 ; see also Wier and Edidin, 1988) onto acceptor sites that are fixed in a position which is close to the membrane plane.",

As this glycosylation event was shown to occur at an early stage of chain translocation it follows that this signal sequence can only interact with the ER membrane during the beginning of chain translocation. In other words, the signal sequence of p62 can only function at the initiation stage of chain translocation and has no role in completing this transfer process. If the latter would be true we would have expected that the signal sequence glycosylation would have occurred first after all of the lumenal domain of the p62 d-4 chain would have been translated and translocated.",

Similarly, when considering models in which the chain transfer occurs directly through a lipid membrane (see the helical hairpin hypothesis, Engelrnan and Steitz, 1981; direct transfer model, von Heijne and Blomberg, 1979; phospholipid channel hypothesis, Nesmayanova, 1982) the interaction of the signal sequence with the lipid bilayer could be of importance only at the stage of translocation initiation but not at the actual chain transfer step.",

            "text": "The possibility that our results about p62 protein translocation would be unique to the viral system .and different from the general translocation process in the ER we find most unlikely. Several results from this and earlier works suggest that the signal sequence of the p62 protein functions much in the same way as cleavable ones do. Firstly, studies with a temperature-sensitive mutant of SFV, ts3, have shown that the signal sequence of p62 requires a free NH2-terminal end for function (Hashimoto et al., 1981) . At the nonpermissive temperature the ts3 mutant is defective in cleavage between the C and the p62 protein region of the protein precursor because of a mutation that inactivates the autoproteolytic activity of C. This defect results in a translocation negative phenotype for the p62 protein. Secondly, the p62 signal sequence has been shown to be SRP dependent. If the mRNA for the structural proteins of SFV is translated in vitro in a wheat germ-derived system that is supplemented with saltwashed (and SRP-deprived) membranes then p62 translocation is observed only in the presence of exogenous SRP (Bonatti et al., 1984) ~ If SRP is supplemented without membranes then p62 translation is arrested. Thirdly, our time course study about p62 synthesis and glycosylation in this work clearly demonstrates that the p62 chain is translocated cotranslationally across the ER membrane. This was also suggested by earlier studies in vitro (Garoff et al., 1978; Bonatti et al., 1984) . In these studies it was shown that both microsomal membranes as well as SRP have to be added to the synthesis mixture before extensive lengths (,,o100 amino acid residues) of the p62 chains have been translated.",
