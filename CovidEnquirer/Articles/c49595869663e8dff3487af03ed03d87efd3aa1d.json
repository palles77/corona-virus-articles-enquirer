Nowadays the capacity of an adjuvant is also measured by the quality as well as the magnitude of the induced immune response, guided by the protective immune response required. Quality includes isotype and IgG subclass responses, T-helper cell responses characterized by the cytokine profile and cytotoxic T cells (CTL). In the early phase of immunization some adjuvants influence the antigen administration and uptake by a so-called depot effect exemplified by aluminium hydroxide gel and oil adjuvants, which possibly is not as desired as alledged. A modem depot is exerted by slow release formulations continuously releasing the antigen over a period of time or by pulses at intervals aiming at 'single injection' vaccine. Great efforts are made to formulate efficient delivery formulations targeting the antigens from the site of administration, to draining lymph nodes or distant lymphatic tissue or to mucosal surfaces by parenteral or mucosal administrations. Nowadays, non-replicating carriers besides replicating vaccines are formulated to induce mucosal immune responses encompassing secretory IgA and CMI. Efforts to evoke immune responses on mucosal membranes distant from the site of administration have resulted mostly in little success. For a long time it was considered that CTL under the restriction of MHC Class I only could be evoked by replicating viruses or intracellular parasites. However, novel adjuvant delivery systems readily induce CTL by delivering the antigen to the AF'C resulting in intracellular transport to the cytosol for the MHC Class I presentation system, as well as to the endosomal pathway for the MHC Class II presentation.",

However, it is not proven whether that really is the main adjuvant effect they exert. Aluminium hydroxide has proved beneficial for priming immune responses to soluble Ag, e.g. toxins and gp120 of HIV-l, but less effective for boosting (Bornford, 1984; Eriksson et al., 1995) . This effect might be due to the adsorption of the Ag to the gel phase, a substitute for the particulate form. It is likely that the local reactions particularly caused by oil emulsions induce an inflammatory response which attracts mainly antigen presenting macrophages. Further, granulocytes and neutrophils contribute to the adjuvant activity by the production of cytokines. Negative side effects on the other hand are well documented in the form of granuloma and even abcesses (Claassen et al.. 1992) . IFA also excites the draining lymph nodes which become enlarged.",

The primary mode of action of microspheres seems to be targeting macrophages mediated by their hydrophobic surface, which particularly applies to PLG microspheres. A particle size of 1 to 3 km seems to be optimal for phagocytosis. A size greater than 10 pm is too large for phagocytosis using the PLG device. Eldridge et al. (1990) could construct microspheres which required 60 to 90 days for erosion, The nature of the PLG coat protects its content from proteolytic attack during this time.

            "text": "While there is a vast literature on Ag processing and presentation by APC to T cells, there are a limited number of reports about the influence of adjuvants. In vitro studies are difficult to perform as many adjuvants (e.g. aluminum hydroxide and oil adjuvants) are not suitable for cell culture work. In contrast, immunostimulating complexes (iscorn) are well suited for cell culture work as well as for immuno-electron microscopy. An iscom is a complex containing Ag and adjuvant held together by hydrophobic interactions. A unique property is the strong binding between the Quillaja triterpenoids and cholesterol which may explain the stability of the complex (Hbglund et al., 1989) . The stability was further demonstrated by Watson et al. (1992) by showing that the internalization of iscoms could be followed for about 30 min in cellular vesicles by incubation of those with macrophages in vitro, or in the peritoneal cavity. Iscom particles were readily visualized in the vesicles of macrophages obtained from mice after in vitro incubation or intraperitoneal (i.p.1 administration of influenza virus iscoms ( Fig.  1 ). In contrast, non-adjuvanted micelles disintegrate and could not be visualized in intracellular vesicles. In the studies of Villacres- Eriksson (1993) using immuno-EM on biotinylated influenza virus Ag, the iscom-borne Ag was traced in about equal amounts to both cytosol and vesicles. These results were further supported by quantitative studies determining the amount of biotinylated Ag in subcellular fractions obtained by differential centrifugation, and a quantitative ELISA using a polyclonal antibody for capture and streptavidin peroxidase for detection. While macrophages take up 50%, DC 16% and B cells 13% of iscom borne Ag, the corresponding values for influenza virus micelles were 25 to 50-fold lower. Enhancement of Ag uptake by APC is probably an important task for an adjuvant. The capacity to deliver Ag to the cytosol is likely to pave the way for MHC Class I restricted Ag presentation resulting in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTLI response (Takahashi et al., 1990) . This is a feature of acid sensitive liposomes (Harding et al., 1991) and of iscoms as non-viable Ag delivery systems. as well as of a synthetic lipopeptide vaccine (Deres et al., 1989) . With the iscom, long-lived cytotoxic memory T cells are induced in mice after one S.C. immunization with 1 kg of Ag (Takahashi et al.. 1990) . One aspect of iscoms that contributes to CTL development is the strong capacity to stimulate lymphocytes producing IFN-y and IL-2. i.e. a T,, 1 type of response . There are a number of reports of other adjuvants inducing CTL, but generally high doses of Ag and several immunizations are required.",

Besides the depot effect dealt with above an adjuvant should be evaluated by its capacity to influence the B cell response by promoting induction of Ab of desired isotypes and subclasses. The modulation of the T cell response is evaluated by the profile of cytokines evoked and the capacity to induce immune response under MHC Class I and Class II restriction (Table 2 ). Excellent reviews have been recently published listing and classifying mode of actions by adjuvants (Cox and Coulter, 1992) . Most adjuvant work is done in mice where the classification of immune response still is easier to perform than in various other species. In Table 2 improving further the targeting to the lymphatic system as above. None of these effects are immunomodulatory per se, but are still important for making vaccine antigens more effective, e.g. by diminishing both the dose of Ag and adjuvant immunomodulator required. Several strategies to form particulate Ag have been used to improve the immune responses to proteins or peptide epitopes by genetically engineering these peptides into self assembling particles (Jenkins et al., 19901 , see Table 2 .",

To overcome the size limitation, Babuik et al. (1994) developed a system which facilitates the attachment of the peptide to the VP6 nucleocapsid protein of rotavirus assembled into spherical particles. Under the appropriate conditions, the rotavirus VP6 internal capsid protein can reassemble into spherical particles indistinguishable from the incomplete particles of rotavirus. To this particle the outer capsid proteins VP4 and VP7 of rotavirus can attach to the inner capsid VP6 protein, to form spherical rotavirus-like particles, by a specific aminoacid sequence C-G-A-S-R-N-I-V- Y-T-R-A on the rotavirus outer capsid protein VP4. This sequence offers the possibility of being used in recombinant DNA-Ags to attach these to the VP6 particle. An interesting approach to direct targeting IS the linking of the protein to antibodies directed against MHC Class II molecues (Carayanniotis and Barber, 1987) . a concept which should be further pursued.",

Regardless of whether they exist in other animal species or not, the T, 1 and T, 2 effects most likely exist, although they may not be defined exactly to T cell subsets. In brief, a T, 1 response is characterized as a cell mediated immune response with the development of a delayed type of hypersensitivity and by production of IL-2 and IFN-. A Tn2 response emphasizes the antibody response and the production of the cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and IL-5 (Table 1) . Recently IL-l 2 has been shown to have a key role in induction of the T, 1 type of immune response being produced by, for example, dendritic cells and macrophages. Few adjuvants so far have been tested for the capacity to induce IL-12 and the list will eventually ecompass more than the two mentioned in Table 2 , i.e. LPS and iscom. Immunomodulation can act either by superimposing a Tnl type of response on T, 2 or vice versa, or by replacing or switching an immune response from T, 2 to T,, 1 which might be an important task for a vaccine against HIV-l (Trinchieri, 1993) ",

However. another possible route for targeting the lymphatic system in the gut is through the enterocytes which may act as APC (Santos et al.. 19901 . A strong indication that iscoms may use enterocytes as APC was shown by Lazarova et al. (1996) . Incorporated influenza virus Ag was transported from apical to basolateral direction across a monolayer of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell line and collected. In contrast to influenza virus Ag non-adjuvanted in micelle form, the iscom borne Ag was processed and induced in vitro a dose dependent proliferative response in T cells from primed mice. Furthermore, the iscom matrix added to the micelle Ag preparation significantly enhanced the transport through the Caco epithelial cells. The subsequently collected Ag fragments also induced a proliferative response in primed T cells (Lazarova et al.. 1996) . These results indicate that iscoms and iscom matrix, besides their adjuvant activity in the gut, may target two routes for induction of immune response.",

Liposomes copresented as a separate entity to the Ag in an experimental vaccine are as effective as liposomes used as a carrier for influenza virus Ag (De Haan et al.. 1995) . possibly by abolishing a tolerance or anergy state (Weiner et al.. 19941 . It should be noted that CT and LT are as efficient for the respiratory tract as for the digestive tract (Staats et al., 1994) . The iscoms have been used with a number of Ag for respiratory tract delivery, mainly with Ag from envelope proteins. e.g. corona virus and various herpesvirus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Hall. 1994 ) and they induce clear-cut serum antibody responses after one intranasal (IN) immunization. A single immunization with 5 g RSV-iscoms induced high secretory IgA titers of mouse lung (unpublished data). After one immunization, iscoms with the envelope protein of influenza virus induce protection to challenge the infection (Liivgren et al.. 19901. Jones et al.
