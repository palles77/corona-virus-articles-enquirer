The efficacy of the tonic was evaluated and expressed as cell proliferation rate and plaque reduction rate in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, against 3 strains of influenza A and B viruses. This boiling water (at 100\u2103 ) extract of Isatidis Radix (RIE) showed antiviral activity against influenza virus A and B. The concentration for 50% inhibition of influenza virus A replication (IC 50 ) in MDCK cell was 12.6 mg/mL with a therapeutic index >8. When cells were incubated with RIE prior to virus adsorption, the numbers of viable cell were at least doubled compared to the numbers of virus control, RIE incubation after virus adsorption and RIE incubation with virus prior to adsorption, in both influenza virus A and B. Moreover, much less virus particles were spotted by scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the RIE pre-treated cells than the cells without RIE treatment. These results indicate the antiviral activity of RIE is mainly attributed to its host cell protection effect but not actions on virus or post-virus-adsorption interruption. Cell, but not virus, is more likely to be the action target of RIE.",

Secondly, as a mixture, RIE contains hundreds of compositions, of which a small proportion would be responsible for the efficacy. For example, only one fifth of total protein of Isatidis Radix is aqueous soluble. Nagai et al . have reported the anti-influenza virus activity of a glycoprotein from roots of Isatis tinctoria L.

Much fewer virus particles appeared on the surface of RIE pre-treated cells (Figure 1a ) than the cells without RIE treatment (Figure 1b) . To ensure the proposed inhibitory effects, the concentration of RIE used in the SEM study was 15 mg/mL, a middle value of the effective concentrations against influenza virus A. Two assumptions are drawn from the results. Firstly, as RIE failed to prevent viral infection by direct actions on viruses and neutralising them, RIE is assumed to act on MDCK cells rather than influenza viruses. Secondly, RIE can bind to cell plasma membrane or enter cell plasma and affect the early events of viral The extract of Isatidis Radix (RIE, 50 mg/mL) was used in all the groups. The proliferation rate of the normal Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell control was defined as 100%. RIE showed protective effects against virus only in \"cell protecting mode\", but no effect in \"cell repairing mode\" and \"virus diminishing mode\". (n\u22654) **, P < 0.01; others, P > 0.05.

The cells were mounted on stubs, coated with gold and observed with a scanning electron microscope (JSM5310/LV, JEOL). Arrows: virus particles bound to the microvilli and other parts of plasma membrane. infection, i.e. binding and fusion of membrane, and thereafter uncoating of virus particles in cytoplasm. These assumptions are based on following observations. As any free RIE was thoroughly washed off after incubation with cells in all three groups, only those RIE who bound to the cell plasma membrane or internalised into the cell plasma would contribute to the rise of cell survival rates. Furthermore, because of the stronger effects of \"protecting mode\" than \"repairing mode\", it is crucial for RIE to participate cell-virus interaction in an early stage, particular prior to the presence of viruses.",

Furthermore, as it targets on an universal substance, the cell plasma membrane, this approach may function upon a wide range of enveloped viruses, regardless of their families, types, strains or year of epidemic. More beautifully, due to the high conservativeness of membrane lipids, this approach is expected to have a low risk of developing virus resistance.

Brassicaceae ), and a widely-used antiviral traditional Chinese medicine. As an officially approved medicinal material (Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, 2005), Isatidis Radix and its decoction (RIE) have been employed as a major herbal tonic in prevention and treatment against a wide range of viral infections, including seasonal flu and the deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (Lin 2005). Regardless of the different subtypes of viruses and their constant mutations, RIE was found to be clinically effective against infections caused by various subtypes and strains of influenza viruses. The antiviral mechanism of RIE remains unclear, with no indication of the target of the antiviral action of RIE, an essential prerequisite to elucidation of the mechanism. There is, as yet, no explanation of the wide spectrum of activity against all strains of the influenza virus.",
