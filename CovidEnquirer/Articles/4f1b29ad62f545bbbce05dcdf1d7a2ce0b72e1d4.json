Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are employed for the detection of antibody in serum, and HI titers correlate with protection from influenza in humans. The WHO has called for research into improved assays for influenza given that HI tests, using turkey erythrocytes have been found to be relatively insensitive for measuring responses to avian H5N1 virus in humans. 1 Since this report was published, however, significant increases in sensitivity have been observed using horse erythrocytes. 2 Neutralization assays allow for more sensitive detection of H5 antibodies, but these are laborious and require Biosafety Level 3 laboratory facilities or higher which are not always available at the front line of an outbreak, especially in resource-limited regions.",

The first option has its inherent problems, namely the issue of possible reversion to the wild-type virus via genetic reassortment. The level of attenuation of such mutants may differ between strains \u2044 isolates and careful risk assessment is required. 3 With the pseudotype system, however, only the HA from influenza is required, with no possibility of recombination or virus escape. These particles undergo abortive replication and do not give rise to replication-competent progeny. Retroviral and lentiviral pseudotypes have been used in lieu of replication-competent virus to study neutralizing antibody responses to viral infection. [5] [6] [7] These pseudotypes encode reporter genes and bear foreign viral envelopes of interest. 8 The transfer of marker genes to target cells depends on the function of the envelope protein; therefore, the titer of neutralizing antibodies against the envelope can be measured by a reduction in marker gene transfer.",

Two weeks post-challenge, the birds were bled and homologous HI titers were determined (Table 3) . From five patients who had recovered from influenza H5N1 during the 2004 and 2005 outbreaks in Viet Nam, heparine-anticoagulated plasma was obtained 8-27 weeks after illness onset (median 11 weeks).

Sera from ferrets infected with live influenza A \u2044 Viet Nam \u2044 1194 \u2044 2004 that had weak turkey HI titers against this virus have high levels of antibodies as measured with our pseudotype assay.

When comparing the correlations (Table 2) . Similarly, serum from a patient who had recovered from infection, by a 1997 HK H5N1 virus also had a strong neutralizing antibody titer as measured by MLV(HA) (800 versus a MN titer of 80) ( Table 1) . Also, sera from chickens that had been immunized with a variety of avian H5 viruses (isolated between 1959 and 2005) showed the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies to the recent A \u2044 Viet Nam \u2044 1194 \u2044 2004 virus in the MLV(HA) assay (Table 3 ). Antisera to an avian H5N1 strain isolated in 1959 could neutralize the VN1194 pseudotype at high titer. Only chickens immunized with A \u2044 TKY \u2044 ONT \u2044 7732 \u2044 66 (H5N9) did not produce high neutralizing antibody titers against the VN1194 HA.

The significance of such cross-neutralizing activity remains to be evaluated by the use of further panels of human and animal sera, and pseudotyped H5 viruses belonging to different antigenic clades.",

A competent molecular virology laboratory could produce HA pseudotype virus within 2-3 weeks of the availability of viral RNA. Further studies are underway, making use of a panel of H5 retroviral pseudotypes with HA components derived from H5N1 viruses involved in the recent human and avian outbreaks. Of particular importance would be cross-clade neutralization studies between viruses from the four different clades of H5N1 (1, 1\u00a2, 2 and 3) 28 as recent studies have shown that there is often poor antigenic cross-reactivity between viruses belonging to the Indonesian (clade 2) and Vietnamese (clade 1) sublineages, an observation that has implications for the design of vaccines against H5N1. 29, 30 There is a need to study the seroprevalence of influenza H5N1 in countries where outbreaks of H5N1 have occurred in humans and where H5N1 is endemic in the avian population. This is, primarily, to determine the extent of avian-to-human and potentially human-to-human transmission. Influenza A \u2044 H5-specific antibody measured by neutralization is currently regarded as the 'gold standard' serological assay for H5N1 infection by the WHO. 1 The neutralization assay is used to detect functional strainspecific antibodies in animal and human sera but as the neutralization assay requires the use of live virus, its use is restricted to those laboratories that have Biosafety Level 3 containment facilities, and for non-attenuated H5N1, this may need to be upgraded to BSL4. Our MLV(HA) assay is at least as sensitive as the live virus-neutralizing antibody assay, and does not require high containment.",

By switching our assay reporter from GFP to Luc our neutralization assay has been adapted for high-throughput usage. This assay is well placed to assess protective neutralizing immunity in sera from experimentally immunized animals (as for the sheep and chickens studied here), and from human clinical trials of pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccines.
