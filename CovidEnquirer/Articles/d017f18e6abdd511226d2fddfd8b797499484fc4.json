India is experiencing the quadruple burden of viral infections including dengue, chikungunya and Zika from last few years, which has created many concerns among surrounding countries, particularly in Pakistan. There are numerous examples of spread of exotic pathogens to new geographic locations by cross-border movements including malaria, dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). This process is facilitated when the environmental conditions across borders share common characteristics [4] . Pakistan shares 2912-kilometer eastern border with India and hundreds of people travel between two countries on daily basis by several routes. Additionally, bilateral trade ties between two countries also increase the risk of disease transmission across borders. In this context, we felt inclined to share our point of view about the potential risk of Nipah outbreak in Pakistan.",

Since Nipah virus can transmit from bats to fruits and vegetables, trade of these commodities from India poses high propensity of disease spread to importer regions including Pakistan. It is pertinent to mention that Pakistan follows disease epidemics of India [5] and risks of Nipah virus spillover cannot be disregarded. We strongly believe that the infectious diseases can easily spread with infected travelers or trade commodities entering the Pakistan, therefore dire aggressive maneuvers to cull the trade or to initiate the surveillance programs are warranted. Since Pakistan is harboring two bat species (Pteropus giganteus, Scotophilus kuhlii) previously shown to have Nipah Virus [6] , Government should chalk out the strategies to handle the current situation of deadly viral load in the region with collaborative efforts, both countries should set aside their differences and conduct joint vector surveillance and control in order to strengthen the preparedness, response and recovery of future epidemics.",
