The partial genomic sequence of WPD virus (WPDV) was first identified in archival tissues from WPD-affected possums (Dunowska et al., 2012) , and a full genomic sequence has been reported recently (Gulyaeva et al., 2017) . Based on the analysis of this sequence, WPDV has been classified within the family Arteriviridae as a sole member of the newly established genus Dipartevirus (Anonymus, 2017; Kuhn et al., 2016) . Aetiological involvement of the virus in the development of WPD has been confirmed by induction of disease by experimental infection of wild-caught possums with a purified WPDV isolate (Giles et al., 2016) .",

As such, interest in understanding pathogens of possums was originally driven by their potential to be used as biological control in New Zealand (Perrott, 1998) , and conversely, from conservation efforts in Australia. Very limited numbers of viruses have been identified from the possum host. In addition to WPDV, these include possum enteroviruses (Zheng, 2007) , possum adenovirus (Thomson et al., 2002) , and possum papillomavirus (Perrott et al., 2000b) . Herpesvirus-and coronavirus-like particles have also been observed in fecal samples from possums by electron microscopy (Rice and Wilks, 1996) . Of these, only WPDV has been linked to severe systemic disease characterised by signs of multifocal neurological disturbances, clinically appearing to involve the vestibular system and resulting in ataxia, a decreased ability to climb, head tremor, and behavioural changes (Giles et al., 2016; Perrott et al., 2000c) . Under experimental conditions, decreased appetite precedes the development of neurological signs and significant weight loss is also observed (Giles et al., 2016) . The histological hallmark of the disease is mononuclear perivascular infiltrates in multiple organs, including the liver, spleen, brain and kidney (O'Keefe et al., 1997; Perrott, 1998) .",

However, the infectious dose and mechanisms of natural transmission of WPDV are currently unknown. Under experimental conditions, healthy wild-caught possums sharing an enclosure with WPD-affected possums developed WPD whereas possums housed in adjacent separate cages remained healthy (Perrott, 1998; Perrott et al., 2000c) . This suggests that the virus is transmitted via direct contact or fomites and that aerosol or droplet transmission does not occur.",

While WPDV shares some features common to arteriviruses, it is only distantly related to other members of the family. Phylogenetically, WPDV comprises a single-virus lineage separate to another lineage that includes all other arteriviruses from different placental hosts (Gulyaeva et al., 2017; Kuhn et al., 2016) . Its basal position in the phylogenetic tree suggests that WPDV is the closest to the ancestral arterivirus. Alternatively, the separation between WPDV and other arterivirus sequences may reflect a convergent evolution of their hosts, marsupials and placental mammals (Luo et al., 2011) . Hence, deciphering pathogenesis and biological properties of WPDV is interesting not only from the point of view of possum health, but also from the evolutionary perspective.",

Briefly, wild-caught possums were individually housed and assigned consecutive ID numbers, before being inoculated via intraperitoneal (IP) injection with purified WPDV isolate (possums 5-8), infected cell culture lysate (possums 9-12), or standard inoculum that comprised a filtered 10% tissue suspension of brain, liver and spleen from seven WPD-affected possums (possums 13-16).

The latter comprised Iodixanol medium (Optiprep, Sigma-Aldrich) equivalent to the position of the virus band from density-gradient purification, but obtained after processing of uninfected cultures of primary possum macrophages. Following the development of neurological signs consistent with WPD, possums were euthanized and two sets of tissue samples from all major internal organs, including multiple regions of the brain, were collected from each possum on post-mortem examination. One piece of each tissue was stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C and another was fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 with added lysine (0.15 M) and sodium-m-periodate (0.01 M) following the method of McClean and Nakane (1974) . Urine, where possible, was collected by cystocentesis and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C. Blood was collected into red-top vacutainer tubes (BD Vacutainer\u00ae) by cardiocentesis or venipuncture of the great vessels. Serum was separated from the clot by centrifugation at 1500 \u00d7g for 10 min and stored at \u2212 80\u00b0C.",

Because total RNA levels extracted from body fluids were extremely low, normalisation to total RNA would have resulted in significant inaccuracies. As such, a direct comparison between viral load in solid tissues and body fluids was not possible. Consistent with results of the previous study (Dunowska et al., 2013) , high levels of viral RNA were present in livers and spleens of all WPD-affected possums. In addition, high levels of viral RNA were also detected in lymph nodes examined. These results suggest that WPDV, similarly to other arteriviruses (Teifke et al., 2001) , has in-vivo tropism for macrophage-rich tissues, which may result in generalized infection of the mononuclear-phagocyte system. This is further supported by the IHC data, with WPDV antigen detected within macrophages in the liver and kidney of infected possums. These results also correspond well with the in-vitro growth requirements for WPDV, as the virus has been cultivated so far only in primary possum macrophages (Giles et al., 2015) . Based on these results, macrophage-rich tissues should be considered as the samples of choice for detection of the virus or viral RNA in diagnostic settings. Detection of moderate to high levels of viral RNA from the sera of all but one infected possum in this study also supports the use of blood or serum samples for detection of WPDV. Finally, detection of moderately high levels of viral RNA in salivary glands raises the possibility of virus excretion in saliva. The latter two sample types (blood and saliva) may provide a means of diagnosis of active infection in live animals, without the necessity of a retrospective diagnosis following death or euthanasia.",

A feature of arteriviruses is the ability to evade the immune response and induce persistent infections (Kimman et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012) . For example, mice infected with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) develop persistent lifelong viraemia which is believed to be facilitated by the fact that the primary target cell for LDV infection is a renewable, continuously regenerated and apparently 'non-vital' subpopulation of macrophages . Persistent viraemia (months to years) has been also described for pigs infected with PRRSV (Benfield et al., 1999) , and for patas monkeys persistently infected with low-virulence isolates (P-248 and P-741) of simian haemorrhagic fever virus (Gravell et al., 1986) .",

This is supported by detection of rising levels of WPDV antibody in two (possums 6 and 15) of those possums. The WPDV antibody levels in the remaining two possums (10 and 14) were already high at the time of experimental infection (Giles et al., 2018) . This response, however, appears to be ineffective at containing virus replication within the time-period studied, as high levels of viral RNA continued to be detected in tissues from possums that were euthanased approximately three weeks later. An on-going inflammatory response may promote egress of circulating monocytes into tissues. This may be an undesirable consequence as, in addition to contributing to tissue damage, they could serve as new targets for virus infection.",

Fighting between possums with exchange of saliva and/or blood through bite wounds may facilitate transmission. Grooming of juvenile possums (joeys) by mothers, face-to-face contact, and hissing during encounters could also facilitate spread of the virus via saliva. Despite comparatively low levels of viral RNA in the urine, urinary excretion of WPDV could provide a source of virus contamination in the environment. Direct contact with urine from infected possums may also occur during sharing of dens by multiple possums. Moderately high levels of viral RNA in the serum raise the possibility that WPDV could be spread by blood-sucking ectoparasites. This is supported by successful induction of WPD by injection of macerated hematophagus mites (Trichosurolaelaps crassipes) derived from WPD-affected possums into healthy possums in one of the previous studies (Perrott et al., 2000c) . Further studies are required to provide experimental support for the main routes of transmission during natural infection as well as the infectious dose of the virus required to elicit compatible clinical signs.",

Regional variations in the distribution of microglia have been described in the brain of mice, with denser populations of microglia in the forebrain as compared to the hindbrain (Lawson et al., 1990; Perry et al., 1985) . Given that macrophages are the target cell of arteriviruses (Duan et al., 1997; Onyekaba et al., 1989; Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) , it is possible that microglia which are similarly derived from myeloid precursors, may support WPDV replication. Whilst IHC for WPDV-antigen was positive in 8/12 brains from WPDV-infected possums, the cell types supporting viral replication were not unequivocally identified. Further investigation into the cell types that support viral replication within the CNS is thus warranted.",

Lesions in the brain included varying degrees of non-suppurative meningoencephalitis, choroiditis, gliosis and glial nodules, the number of which varied between possums. The cause of the glial nodules in one control possum is unknown, however, it is unlikely to be related to active WPDV infection as this possum was clinically normal and viral RNA was not detected in its brain. The preponderance of inflammatory infiltrates in the subependymal region of the brain in some infected possums is intriguing. Similar periventricular lesion location has been reported for neurotropic coronaviruses such as feline infectious peritonitis virus and mouse hepatitis virus (Diaz and Poma, 2009 ) and occasionally for neurotropic arterivirus variants, for example during field outbreaks of PRRSV (Thanawongnuwech et al., 1997) .",

Mild azotaemia was present in two and severe azotaemia in another two of 12 infected possums suggesting that despite gross and pathological changes observed in the kidneys, acute severe kidney injury was not a universal feature of WPDV infection. Whilst histological features of nephritis support the possibility that azotaemia in the four WPDV-infected possums was of renal origin, pre-renal causes such as dehydration cannot be ruled out, particularly in possums with milder azotaemia. The determination of urine specific gravity (USG) could have helped in the differentiation of pre-renal and renal azotaemia, but was not performed. Leptospirosis was also considered as a possible cause of the renal changes. This disease is endemic in New Zealand and infection with pathogenic serovars can result in kidney disease. However, only one control possum and one WPD-affected possum were positive for leptospiral DNA and it is unlikely that pre-existing infection with pathogenic Leptospira spp. resulted in the biochemical or histological changes observed in the kidneys of Leptospira-negative possums.",

Immunopositivity was predominantly observed within the cytoplasm of macrophages in interstitial inflammatory aggregates and to a lesser extent in cells within glomeruli. Whilst the cellular populations supporting the virus replication within these locations are currently unknown, we speculate that these are cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage, such as interstitial macrophages and/or mesangial cells. This is based on the fact that arteriviruses are generally tissue-type and cell-type specific, primarily replicating in macrophages (Duan et al., 1997; Onyekaba et al., 1989; Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) . However, expanded cell and tissue tropism has been described for highly pathogenic arteriviruses, including a highly pathogenic PRRSV that is capable of replication within distal renal tubular epithelium in pigs (Li et al., 2012) . Thus, to further understand the pathogenesis of renal lesions the exact cell types supporting viral replication within kidney tissues need to be further investigated.",

Hence, the pathogenicity of the virus following a natural exposure to a potentially lower infectious dose may differ from that described in this paper. However, healthy possums infected with various infectious inocula during one of the previous studies (Perrott et al., 2000c) developed disease with indistinguishable clinical and pathological features irrespective of the type of inoculum and the route of exposure used. The latter included IP, intra-gastric, intra-tracheal and intra-dermal infections. In addition to the SI, blood, urine and minced mites collected from WPD-affected possum were used as infectious inocula. Importantly, five possums infected via direct contact with two experimentally infected possums also developed WPD. With the exception of an apparently longer incubation period, suggesting that it took some time for in-contact possums to acquire WPDV infection, the clinical disease and pathological changes were the same for all affected possums. Altogether, this suggests that the tissue distribution of the virus and histopathological features observed in experimentally infected possums in the current study are likely to be relevant for the natural infection.",

In addition, we have detected WPDV in diseased tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The preferred sites for replication of WPDV were splenic, hepatic and lymphoid tissues, making these samples of choice for diagnostic testing of deceased animals. Histological changes and moderate amounts of RNA were also present within other tissues including sera and salivary glands, suggesting that blood and saliva may be used for diagnosis of infection in live animals. Apparent tropism for macrophage-rich tissues may reflect a generalized infection of the mononuclear-phagocyte system. Within the central nervous system, there seem to be location-related differences in virus tropism. Levels of viral RNA remained high in all tissues tested throughout the duration of the study, suggesting that on-going virus replication and evasion of the immune responses may be important in the pathogenesis of a chronic disease state. The observations described in this paper may inform experimental design of further studies into mechanisms and duration of virus persistence following natural infection with WPDV.",
