Influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant circulating influenza virus subtype, with consistently significant and robust effect on mortality rates. Influenza was associated with an annual death rate from all causes, from underlying pneumonia and influenza, and from underlying circulatory and respiratory conditions of 14.8 (95% confidence interval 9.8-19.8), 2.9 (1.0-5.0), and 11.9 (8.3-15.7) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. These results are comparable with observations in the United States and subtropical Hong Kong. An estimated 6.5% of underlying pneumonia and influenza deaths were attributable to influenza. The proportion of influenza-associated deaths was 11.3 times higher in persons age >65 years than in the general population. Our findings support the need for influenza surveillance and annual influenza vaccination for at-risk populations in tropical countries.",

The annual mean number of tests positive for influenza A was 5.8% (range 2.6%\u22129.5%) and for influenza B, 0.9% (range 0.4%\u2212 1.6%). Annually, influenza A (H3N2) was the predominant influenza virus subtype in circulation. During the study period, peaks in influenza A (H3N2) were observed from December 1998 to January 1999 (the predominant circulating strain was A/Sydney/5/97), December 2000 to January 2001 (A/Moscow/10/99), December 2002 to January 2003 (A/Moscow/10/99), and October-November 2003 (A/Fujian/411/2002). Smaller peaks were noted in April\u2212July in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2002, and from September to November in 1999 and 2003. During the 8-year period, an annual mean of 15,616 deaths (range 15,301\u221216,024) occurred in Singapore. An average of 1,798 (range 1,545\u22122,340) underlying P&I deaths and 8,237 (range 7,833\u22128,715) underlying C&R deaths occurred each year (",
