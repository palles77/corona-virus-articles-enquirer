An IL-12 expression vector (IL-12DNA) encoding single-chain IL-12 proteins comprised of p40 and p35 subunits were constructed. This vaccine provided remarkable protective efficacy in mouse and guinea pig models compared to the BCG vaccine on the basis of C.F.U of number of TB, survival, an induction of the CD8 positive CTL activity and improvement of the histopathological tuberculosis lesions. This vaccine also provided therapeutic efficacy against multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) (prolongation of survival time and the decrease in the number of TB in the lung) in murine models. Furthermore, we extended our studies to a cynomolgus monkey model, which is currently the best animal model of human tuberculosis. This novel vaccine provided a higher level of the protective efficacy than BCG based upon the assessment of mortality, the ESR, body weight, chest X-ray findings and immune responses. All monkeys in the control group (saline) died within 8 months, while 50% of monkeys in the HSP65+hIL-12/HVJ group survived more than 14 months post-infection (the termination period of the experiment). Furthermore, the BCG priming and HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ vaccine (booster) by the priming-booster method showed a synergistic effect in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkey (100% survival). In contrast, 33% of monkeys from BCG Tokyo alone group were alive (33% survival). Furthermore, this vaccine exerted therapeutic efficacy (100% survival) and augmentation of immune responses in the TB-infected monkeys. These data indicate that our novel DNA vaccine might be useful against Mycobacterium tuberculosis including XDR-TB and MDR-TB for human therapeutic clinical trials.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis is a major global threat to human health, with about 2 million people dying every year from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection. The only tuberculosis vaccine currently available is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG), although its efficacy against adult TB disease remains controversial. Furthermore, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extremely drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) are becoming big problems in the world. In such circumstances, the development of therapeutic vaccine against TB as well as prophylactic vaccine against TB is required. Therefore, we have recently developed a novel TB vaccine, a DNA vaccine expressing mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (HSP65) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) delivered by the hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ)-liposome (HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ). This vaccine was 100 fold more efficient than BCG in the murine model on the basis of the elimination of M. tuberculosis mediated by the induction of CTL [1, 2] . Futhermore the HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ vaccine using HVJ-envelope was 10,000 fold more efficient than BCG in the murine TB-prophylactic model. A nonhuman primate model of TB will provide information for vaccine development. In fact, in the previous study we evaluated the protective efficacy of HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ in the cynomolgus monkey model, which is an excellent model of human tuberculosis [1, 4] . In the present study, we observed the synergistic effect of the HSP65 + IL-12/HVJ and BCG using a priming-booster method in the TB-infected cynomolgus monkeys. The combination of the two vaccines showed a very strong prophylactic efficacy against M. tuberculosis (100% survival) as we have seen previously in the murine model of TB [2, 5] . Moreover, we evaluated therapeutic effect of this vaccine on the MDR-TB infection and XDR-TB infection in murine and monkey models, indicating that the vaccine exerts therapeutic efficacy against TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB.",

It is very important to evaluate the long survival period in a monkey model, as human TB is a chronic infection disease. Furthermore, the decrease in the body weight of TB patients is usually accompanied by a progression of the disease. [10] DNA vaccine are a relatively new approach to immunization for infectious diseases. 1,2,5,11-14 Prophylactic and therapeutic DNA vaccines were established by using several kinds of vectors such as (1) HVJ-liposome, (2) HVJ-envelope, (3) adenovirus vector, (4) adeno-associated virus vector (AAV), (5) lenti-virus vector. 1,2, 9 We have developed a hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-Envelope) using inactivated Sendai virus, as a nonviral vector for drug delivery. [15] [16] [17] It can deliver very efficiently DNA, siRNA, proteins and anti-cancer drugs into cells both in vitro and in vivo 15, 18, 19 . Therefore, HVJ-Envelope was used as an efficient and safe vector for DNA vaccine against TB in the present study.",

In Japan and other countries, the BCG vaccine is inoculated into human infants (0~6months after birth).
