Mild increases of cells and/or protein related to increased hydrostatic pressure (modified transudate) often result from chronic transudation of fluid or passage across a membrane. Exudation of significant numbers of neutrophils and/or macrophages from injured lymphatic and blood vessels (exudate) results from infectious or noninfectious etiologies. Colored effusions are distinctive forms of exudation. (Modified from Meyer DJ, Harvey JW: Veterinary laboratory medicine-interpretation and diagnosis, ed 3, Elsevier, St Louis, 2004.)",

Detailed physiologic descriptions of serous body cavity homeostasis are available (Bouvy and Bjorling, 1991; Dempsey and Ewing, 2011; Forrester, 1988) . These serous body cavities are lined by specialized cells, termed mesothelial cells. Accumulation of fluid in these potential spaces results from an imbalance in fluid production and removal. Clinical signs of the presence of increased amounts of fluid include abdominal distension, abdominal pain, dyspnea with an obstructive breathing pattern, muffled heart sounds, and cardiac arrhythmias. Collection and evaluation of fluid from these sites may be therapeutic as well as diagnostic for the presence of inflammatory, hemorrhagic, neoplastic, or lymphatic conditions. Further diagnostic tests may be indicated as per the cytologic characteristics. Removal and examination of fluid is a relatively low-risk procedure, particularly for the diagnostic yield that can be produced.",

Infiltrate an area at the costochondral junction, or approximately where the lower and mid-thorax meet, with local anesthetic. Use a 16-to 18-gauge over-the-needle catheter with a three-way valve to which a 30or 60-mL syringe is attached. Always maintain negative pressure on the syringe as the chest wall is punctured. Carefully advance the needle into the fourth intercostal space through a nick incision in the direction of the heart. Advance the needle until resistance is met (from the pericardium). A release will be felt as the needle enters the pericardial sac, and a flash of blood is often seen. Thread the tubing or catheter so that it is securely within the pericardial sac.

A portion of the sample should also be placed in a red-top tube (or any sterile tube without additives) for biochemical assays such as potassium, creatinine, lactate, and glucose. Finally, a portion of the fluid should be placed in a sterile tube for aerobic, anaerobic, mycoplasma, and fungal cultures. Samples intended for culture should not be refrigerated and should be processed within 24 hours of obtaining. Tubes that contain EDTA should not be used for bacterial culture because EDTA is bacteriostatic (Songer and Post, 2005) . For cytologic examination, make both a direct nonconcentrated smear by a squash or blood film spread technique and smears from the pellet of a centrifuged sample using either a blood film spread or squash technique. Samples can be spun for 3 to 5 minutes at 450 g (approximately 1500 to 2000 rpm) to obtain the pellet. From the resulting supernatant, a total protein should be measured by refractometry. The remaining pellet is reconstituted using an equal amount of remaining liquid by flicking the tube with a finger or using a stir stick. A small amount of unspun fluid may additionally be placed in a cytocentrifuge if available, and a cytospin preparation be produced for improved visibility of cytoplasmic features. Methanolic Romanowsky stains such as Wright stain or an aqueous Romanowsky stain can be applied to a few slides for immediate in-house evaluation. The remaining unstained smears and an EDTA and serum tube filled with fluid may be submitted to the laboratory for diagnostic confirmation. Maher et al (2010) showed that after 24 and 48 hours of storage, there is a significant decrease in the total nucleated cell count, a decrease in the number of neutrophils and neoplastic cells, and an increase in the number of unrecognizable cells. In addition, bacteria that were seen in fresh samples were no longer found at 24 and 48 hours (Maher et al., 2010) . Whenever possible, the tubes should be sent overnight on ice to prevent in vitro changes along with freshly prepared slides. This will allow the clinical pathologist evaluating the sample to compare the cellularity and appearance of the cells in the sample submitted with those in the tube at the time of collection.",

Both methods offer accurate readings in a wide range of protein concentrations (Braun et al., 2001; George, 2001; George and O'Neill, 2001) . It has been shown with canine effusions that refractometry underestimates the protein content when the concentration is less than 2.0 g/dL, and that spectrophotometry using the biuret method is more accurate when there is high protein content (Braun et al., 2001) . Others have found that refractometry can be used accurately down to 1.0 g/dL (George and O'Neill, 2001) . A similar finding of underestimating the protein content in feline effusions with refractometry may also occur (Papasouliotis et al., 2002) . In that same study, a dry chemistry analyzer produced increased globulin concentration and therefore lower albumin:globulin (A:G) ratios when compared with a reference wet analyzer using the same biuret and bromocresol green methodologies. This finding is particularly important because decreased A:G ratios support a diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis (Hartmann et al., 2003; Shelly et al., 1988) .

With this information, one can begin to narrow down the list of possible causes for the abnormal fluid accumulation. For samples being submitted to a reference laboratory, placing some of the sample in a lavender-top tube (EDTA) and some in a red-top tube is recommended. The lavender-top tube contains anticoagulant, which prevents the sample from clotting if there is a high protein content. Red blood cell mass can be roughly estimated by spinning a microhematocrit tube of fluid and measuring the packed cell volume (PCV). This is mainly applicable to fluids that are red and semi-translucent to opaque.",

            "text": "A fluid is classified as a modified transudate when a transudate changes its physical features. The accumulation of a transudate in a body cavity causes increased pressure, which is irritating to the mesothelial cells lining the space. They respond by proliferating and sloughing into the effusion. With time, the sloughed mesothelial cells die and in so doing release chemoattractants that draw small numbers of phagocytes into the effusion to remove cellular debris. The result is a mild increase in both total protein (greater than 2.5 g/dL) and nucleated cell count (less than 5000/\u03bcL). Thus, modified transudates are generally transudates that have been present long enough to elicit a mild inflammatory reaction ( Fig. 6 -7B). They are most often associated with cardiovascular disease ( Fig. 6 -8) or neoplastic conditions; however, posthepatic, postsinusoidal, and sinusoidal portal hypertension usually presents with a modified transudate abdominal effusion (Buob, 2011) . In cases of extended duration, modified transudates can have a cloudy or milky appearance. Such fluids strongly resemble chyle and, in fact, have in the past been called \"pseudochylous effusions\" (a term no longer used). The gross appearance of these fluids is the result of high lipid content (due to higher cholesterol content than serum) but is in no way related to a true chylous effusion, because there are no triglycerides or chylomicrons present (Fossum et al. 1986b; Hillerdal, 1997; Meadows and MacWilliams, 1994) . The phagocytes attracted to remove cellular debris from transudates are rich in enzymes that digest protein but are virtually devoid of enzymes that will break down complex lipids. Consequently, while most of the constituents of dying cells are removed by phagocytosis, lipid content of the cells simply accumulates in the effusion. Effusions formed in this manner are easily distinguished cytologically from true chylous effusions (Fossum et al., 1986b) .",

Mitoses are increased, and occasional multinucleated reactive mesothelial cells are seen. Reactive mesothelial cells in clusters are capable of imbibing lipid from the effusion fluid, and when they do, they take on the characteristics of secretory cells. In this form they must be differentiated from metastatic adenocarcinoma or mesothelioma. This may be done by critically evaluating the cell populations for criteria of malignancy. However, differentiation between neoplasia and mesothelial hyperplasia can be occasionally challenging to the less experienced, and a second opinion is recommended.",

In most cases the principal inflammatory cell is the nondegenerate neutrophil, but neutrophils rarely account for more than 30% of the total cell population. Over time, modified transudates gradually become cytologically indistinguishable from nonspecific exudates. One method used to distinguish transudates or modified transudates from exudates is measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration in canine effusions (Parra et al., 2006) . A CRP level of 4 \u03bcg/mL could be used to reliably differentiate transudates from exudates, whereas a level of 11 \u03bcg/mL could be used to differentiate modified transudates from exudates. Zoia et al (2009) advocate using a combination of variables, including lactate dehydrogenase and protein ratios, in feline pleural effusions and the serum to distinguish transudate from exudate by applying a set of criteria adopted from human medicine. This method of differentiation has not gained widespread acceptance.",

FIP has been noted to cause 18% of pleural (Davies and Forrester, 1996) , 9.8% of pericardial (Davidson et al., 2008) , and 5% of abdominal (Wright, 1999) effusions. Classification as an inflammatory effusion is based primarily on the presence of high total protein (often greater than 4.5 g/dL), which is a reflection of a similar elevation in serum protein, as well as the product of vasculitis and increased vascular permeability. Cytologically these fluids are usually relatively low in cell number (1000 to 30,000/\u03bcL) and inconsistent with regard to the cell types present. In a majority of cases the predominant cell is the nondegenerate neutrophil (Fig. 6-14A ). However, activated macrophages are commonly observed (Fig. 6-14B ) (Norris et al., 2005; Paltrinieri et al., 1999) . In rare cases the lymphocyte is prevalent and the effusion can even appear chyle-like (Savary et al., 2001) . Regardless of the predominant cell type, slides in all cases have a bluish-gray to purple granular background that results from the high protein content (Fig. 6-14A&B) , and clumps and strands of fibrin may be observed.",

In the more chronic reactions, there is generally a significant reactive mesothelial cell component to the response. A striking feature of the inflammatory response is the morphology of neutrophils. Whereas most cases of septic pleuritis and peritonitis are signaled by the presence of predominantly degenerating neutrophils, in nocardial and actinomycotic effusions the majority of the neutrophils away from the organisms are nondegenerate or show signs of aging (hypersegmentation) or apoptosis (karyorrhexis and/or pyknosis). Degenerating neutrophils are only seen immediately in the vicinity of the bacterial organisms because these agents, in contrast to most other bacteria, produce only weak local toxins. The net effect of this phenomenon is that smears in these cases may be easily misinterpreted as noninfectious, particularly if the organisms are not widespread. Because the particles seen grossly often are composed of bacterial colonies, it is important that squash preparations of these particles be examined to ensure that the diagnosis is not missed (Fig. 6-15B&C ).

Etiologies such as gastric dilatation and volvulus, cholelithiasis, gunshot wounds, and iatrogenic secondary to fine needle aspiration or surgery have all been reported. In addition, it is an infrequent accompaniment to diaphragmatic hernia from any cause in the dog and cat. When the results of direct trauma are mainly in the biliary system, leakage of bile is virtually always restricted to the peritoneal cavity, with a resulting peritonitis. When associated with diaphragmatic hernia, leakage of bile occurs when liver is trapped in the diaphragmatic rent and there is rupture or necrosis of the gall bladder or common bile duct. In this circumstance, both peritonitis and pleuritis can result. Bile is a very irritating substance; its presence quickly elicits an inflammatory response. Grossly, the fluid may be initially brown (Fig. 6-1G ) to yellow to greenish; however, as the response becomes more and more cellular, this discoloration may become masked. Large volumes of fluid can usually be obtained. Based on physical characteristics, these effusions are usually exudates (Ludwig et al., 1997; Owens et al., 2003) . Cytologically, the striking feature of bilious effusion is the presence of bile in the smear. Frequently, bile is seen as yellow to green to blue-black granular material scattered in the slide background ( Fig. 6-17A -C) and in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, reactive mesothelial cells, and macrophages. In reactions of greater duration, bile granules may have all been converted to rhomboidal to amorphous golden crystals of bile pigment. When such crystals are found in the cytoplasm of effusion phagocytes in the absence of evidence of prior hemorrhage (e.g., erythrophagocytosis), the possibility of bilious effusion should be strongly considered. In addition to the typical appearance of bilious effusions, acellular, amorphous, fibrillar blue-grey mucinous (Owens et al., 2003) . Accumulations of this extracellular material are the predominant cytologic finding in contrast to the more typical green or yellow bile granules. It is suspected that this bile-free material is produced by biliary and gallbladder epithelium as a consequence to extrahepatic biliary obstruction with regurgitation of normal bile into hepatic lymph and venous blood. This material has been termed \"white bile\" (Owens et al., 2003) .",

Several case reports exist noting these specific neoplasms as the etiology of the eosinophilic effusion (Barrs et al., 2002; Bounous et al., 2000; Cowgill and Neel, 2003; Harris et al., 2013; Peaston and Griffey, 1994; Tomiyasu et al., 2010) . Heartworm disease, interstitial pneumonia, disseminated eosinophilic granulomatosis, peritoneal cestodiasis (Patten et al., 2013) , and sarcocystosis (Allison et al., 2006) are other possibilities in dogs. A case of lung worms in a cat with an eosinophilic effusion has been reported (Miller et al., 1984) . Dacron implants have also been implicated as an iatrogenic etiology in eosinophilic effusions (Macintire et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "Uroperitoneum in cats and dogs is frequently seen secondary to a ruptured bladder, although compromise of any of the urinary tract that lies within the peritoneal cavity can produce uroperitoneum. The most common cause of a ruptured bladder is trauma (Aumann et al., 1998; Burrows and Bovee, 1974) . Sources of trauma include blunt abdominal trauma (e.g., vehicular), aggressive catheterization or aggressive palpation/expression. Urine in the peritoneal space results in chemical irritation. The protein content and total nucleated cell count may be variable as a result of dilution from the urine. Early in the condition, a mononuclear cell population may predominate, suggestive of a modified transudate. Later the neutrophil is usually the predominant cell type as effusion becomes an exudate (Fig. 6-2) . Bacteria may or may not be present. Neutrophils exposed to the irritant material may show karyorrhexis, pyknosis, or karyolysis with ragged nuclear borders (Fig. 6-19A-C) . In some cases urinary crystals are found on cytologic examination, which supports the diagnosis of uroperitoneum. In cats the creatinine and potassium concentrations in the effusion were found to be higher than serum concentrations (generally a ratio of 2:1) (Aumann et al., 1998) . A higher effusion creatinine concentration vs. serum creatinine concentration tends to persist longer than a higher effusion urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration vs. serum BUN concentration because creatinine equilibrates more slowly than urea nitrogen. One study found that 85% of dogs with uroperitoneum had an abdominal fluid:serum creatinine ratio greater than 2:1 (all of these dogs had an effusion creatinine concentration that was four times the serum concentration), and 100% had an abdominal fluid:serum potassium greater than 1.4:1 (Schmiedt et al., 2001) . In addition, serum Na:K also tends to be decreased in cases of uroabdomen (Aumann et al., 1998; Burrows and Bovee, 1974) . Cases of urothorax have been described in a dog and a cat (Klainbart et al., 2011; St\u00f6rk et al., 2003) .",

This disease has been termed canine peritoneal larval cestodiasis, or CPLC (Patten et al., 2013) . Pleural involvement has also been reported (Toplu et al., 2004) . Rare reports of infection involve cats (Eleni et al., 2007; Jabbar et al., 2012; Venco et al., 2005) . Peritoneal aspirates from anorexic, ascitic dogs have the gross appearance of tapioca pudding or cream of wheat ( Fig. 6-20A ). Motile cestodes can be seen in fluid with the unaided eye. Microscopically, the fluid is usually a suppurative exudate (Caruso et al., 2003) ; however, eosinophilic inflammation has also been described (Patten et al., 2013) . Microscopic examination may also show acephalic metacestodes or acoelomic tissue with calcareous corpuscles (Fig. 6-20B) , which may be seen in nonspecific cestode infections. Less often seen microscopically are metacestodes with visible tetrathyridia, a unique larval form having four suckers that represents the asexual reproductive form of Mesocestoides spp. infection (Fig. 6-20C ). Cestode ova are not usually found in the feces (Crosbie et al., 1998) . Molecular testing is necessary for identification of the different Mesocestoides species (Crosbie et al., 2000) . Cases of this parasitic disease have been reported in Italy, Germany, and Japan (Bonfanti et al., 2004; Kashiide et al., 2014; Wirtherle et al., 2007) . See Appendix for more images.",

Causes for chylous effusions in the thoracic cavity include cardiovascular disease, neoplasia (e.g., lymphoma, thymoma, and lymphangiosarcoma), heartworm disease, diaphragmatic hernia (Kerpsack et al., 1994) , lung torsion, mediastinal fungal granulomas, chronic coughing, vomiting, primary lymphedema, iatrogenic, or idiopathic Fossum et al., 1986a; Fossum et al., 1991; Fossum, 1993; Mclane and Buote, 2011; Meakin et al., 2013; Neath et al., 2000; Schuller et al., 2011; Singh and Brisson, 2010; Small et al., 2008; Waddle and Giger, 1990) . In one study (Fossum et al., 1986a) , Afghan Hounds appeared to have a higher incidence of chylothorax than other breeds of dogs. This may be due to Afghans being overrepresented in cases of lung lobe torsion (Neath et al., 2000) . Purebred cats were overrepresented in a 1991 retrospective study by Fossum et al. Chylous pleural effusions are more prevalent in cats (30.5%) than dogs (18.9%) (Davies and Forrester, 1996; Mellanby et al., 2002) ; however, the prevalence of chylothorax in the Mellanby study may be underestimated as mediastinal effusions were also included in that study. Chylomediastinum has not been described in animals.",

Chylous effusions may be clear or serosanguineous depending on the diet. Chylous effusions have a triglyceride concentration that is greater than the serum triglycerides concentration; often the effusion:serum ratio is greater than 3:1 (Fossum et al., 1986b; Meadows and MacWilliams, 1994) . In addition, a cholesterol-to-triglyceride (C:T) ratio of less than one was proposed to be characteristic of a chylous effusion (Fossum et al., 1986b) . However, another study found it to be less reliable (Waddle and Giger, 1990) . Based on lipoprotein electrophoretic studies, pleural chylous effusions can be better identified by fluid triglyceride concentrations greater than 100 mg/dL and nonchylous effusions by concentrations less than 100 mg/dL (Waddle and Giger, 1990) .",

Notably, the total protein measured by refractometry can be very high due to artifactual interference by the lipid in the solution (George, 2001) . Initially, the chylous effusion is characterized by predominantly small lymphocytes (Figs. 6-22 and 6-23A) . Chyle is an irritant and over time, neutrophils and/ or macrophages become prominent, although small lymphocytes with lesser numbers of reactive lymphocytes are readily observed as are reactive mesothelial cells. \"Smeared\" nuclear material from ruptured lymphocytes may also be admixed (Fossum et al., 1986a; Fossum et al., 1986b; Schuller et al., 2011; Small et al., 2008) .

These effusions are serosanguineous to red depending on the duration of the exudate and the extent of the hemorrhage. Physical evaluation reveals a protein concentration slightly less than that of peripheral blood. PCV of effusions is often the same or slightly less than that of peripheral blood (Culp et al., 2010; Mandell and Drobatz, 1995; Mongil et al., 1995) . Hemoperitoneum is generally divided into traumatic and nontraumatic (spontaneous), with the former being subdivided into blunt trauma (e.g., motor vehicle accident) and penetrating (e.g., gunshot wound). Malignant neoplasia was the final diagnosis in 68.3% to 80% of canine cases of acute nontraumatic hemoperitoneum (Aronsohn et al., 2009; Pintar et al., 2003) . Of them, 63.3% to 88% were determined to be hemangiosarcoma. Other causes of canine hemoperitoneum include hematomas, torsion (liver and splenic), and coagulopathies such as rodenticide intoxication (Aronsohn et al., 2009; Beal et al., 2008; Pintar et al., 2003) . Similar studies in cats implicate malignant neoplasia as the etiology in feline hemoperitoneum in 44% to 46% of cases (Culp et al., 2010; Mandell and Drobatz, 1995) . Hemangiosarcoma comprised 28% and 60% of these tumors. Other etiologies include coagulopathies, hepatic necrosis, ruptured urinary bladder, hepatic torsion, hepatic rupture secondary to amyloidosis, and FIP-associated lesions of the liver and kidney (Culp et al., 2010; Mandell and Drobatz, 1995; Swann and Brown, 2001) .",

Rare cases of lymphoma have cells that are morphologically similar to normal small lymphocytes. These cases are problematic, and cytology can only suggest the possibility of lymphoma.

Evaluation of the types of lymphoid cells found within the fluid by immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry may provide useful information. A monotypic population of medium and/or large lymphocytes is more likely associated with neoplasia (Figs. 6-26C, 6-28, and 6-29) than with a reactive process. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies against the molecules CD3 (T-cell) and CD79a or CD20 (B-cell) is helpful in these cases for minimal phenotyping. Additional information is found in Chapter 17.",

            "text": "Mesothelioma is an uncommon tumor that arises from the mesothelial lining of the serous body cavities. One report involving five dogs suggested that mesotheliomas can arise in dogs secondary to chronic idiopathic pericardial hemorrhage (Machida et al., 2004) . Cytologically, mesothelioma is extremely challenging to differentiate from carcinoma or marked reactive mesothelial hyperplasia. Mesothelioma cells are generally round to slightly polygonal in shape and are arranged primarily in clusters; however, spindle shapes have also been observed. This variation in cytomorphology likely arises from the multiple histologic subtypes, including a granular cell morphology, deciduoid (Morini et al., 2006) , epithelioid (Leisewitz and Nesbit, 1992) , cystic, sclerosing (Geninet et al., 2003) , and even a lipid-rich form (Avakian et al., 2008) . Nuclei are hyperchromic and located centrally. Often nuclei of adjacent cells within a cluster appear to press against each other resulting in deformation of nuclei (nuclear molding). Because of the difficulty of differentiating mesothelioma from reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, caution must be used when evaluating suspect populations for criteria of malignancy. As with effusions associated with carcinomas, at least five strong nuclear criteria of malignancy must be seen before a presumptive diagnosis is made. When there is still cytologic ambivalence, a second opinion is recommended, especially related to the variable cytologic morphology of mesothelioma (Figs. 6-33, 6-34, and 6-35). Once the diagnosis of malignancy has been established, cytology cannot further differentiate mesothelioma from carcinoma. A presumptive diagnosis of carcinoma is logical based on relative frequency of their occurrence. One tool to attempt to diagnose mesothelioma is the dual expression of cytokeratin and vimentin immunomarkers (Avakian et al., 2008; Bacci et al., 2006; Geninet et al., 2003; Gumber et al., 2011; Morini et al., 2006) (Fig. 6-36A&B) . A case of mesothelioma has been recognized by the use of the immunohistochemical marker calretinin in a horse (Stoica et al., 2004) . Although calretinin has been used to diagnose mesothelioma in humans and one horse, this immunomarker has consistently been shown to be negative in dogs and cats (Bacci et al., 2006; Geninet et al., 2003; Morini et al., 2006) .",

The pericardial effusion is often associated with moderate to marked mesothelial hyperplasia, which mimics carcinoma cells. The mesothelial cells are very large with dark basophilic cytoplasm and are often binucleated with prominent nucleoli (Fig. 6-4B ). Mitotic figures that are occasionally bizarre may mimic carcinoma. Consequently, cytology often cannot reliably differentiate mesothelial cell hyperplasia from neoplasia. Unlike hemangiosarcoma, which may cause pericardial hemorrhage and exfoliate large individualized neoplastic endothelial cells, other neoplasms of mesenchymal origin typically do not shed neoplastic cells into effusions. To underscore the difficulty in diagnosis, 74% of 19 neoplastic effusions were not detected with cytology and 13% of 31 nonneoplastic effusions were falsely reported as neoplastic. In another study that evaluated 47 pericardial effusions, cytology identified the cause in only six (12.8%); five were infectious and one was lymphoma (MacDonald et al., 2009) . Interestingly, when PCV of the fluid was less than 10%, a cytologic diagnosis was made in 20.3% vs. only 7.7% when PCV was greater than 10% (Cagle et al., 2014) . Serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) were evaluated in 37 dogs with pericardial effusions. Higher serum cTnI concentrations (mean 2.77 ng/dL; range 0.09 to 47.18 ng/dL) were more frequently associated with effusions related to hemangiosarcoma than with idiopathic pericardial effusions (mean 0.05 ng/dL; range 0.03 to 0.09 ng/dL). Serum cTnT was not diagnostically useful (Shaw et al., 2004) . In another study a plasma cTnI concentration greater than 0.25 ng/ mL had a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 100% in identifying pericardial effusions associated with cardiac hemangiosarcoma (Chun et al., 2010) .",

Measurement of pericardial fluid pH was found to be diagnostically helpful when measured by precise instrumentation (Edwards, 1996) . A pH greater than 7.3 was more likely associated with noninflammatory disease, usually neoplasia. Using a urine dipstick to measure pH, a pericardial fluid pH greater than or equal to 7.0 was associated with neoplasia in 93% of the cases, whereas a value less than 7.0 was more often associated with nonneoplastic disease. Other studies using the urine dipstick to measure the pH of pericardial effusions generally found that there was too much overlap for it to be diagnostically reliable (Fine et al., 2003; de Laforcade et al., 2005) .",

A broader study (Hall et al., 2007) involving 146 samples found that 75.4% of cases of pericardial effusion had an assumed cause of congestive heart failure. Neoplasia accounted for 5.4% of cases, most of which were lymphoma. FIP was the assumed cause in one case (0.7%). Rush et al (1990) found neoplasia associated with 18% of cases, whereas Hall et al (2007) found neoplasia in 5.5% of cases. Lymphoma made up approximately half of the cases in both studies. Amati et al (2014) found six of seven cases of pericardial lymphoma being T-cell. MacGregor et al (2004) reported the presence of elongate to rhomboid-shaped cholesterol crystals in pericardial effusion from a dog. This was in contrast to a more typical plate appearance as from a case of canine peritoneal fluid (Fig. 6-40A&B ). Another uncommon finding was ciliated columnar cells arising from an oviductal hamartoma as described in the abdominal fluid from a dog (Fry et al., 2003) . Barium crystals may be found in effusions postradiographic imaging following tissue injury (Fig. 6-41 ).",
