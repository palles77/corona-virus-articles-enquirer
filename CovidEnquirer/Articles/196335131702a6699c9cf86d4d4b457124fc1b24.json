            "text": "The fusion of B-lymphocytes from immunized animals with myeloma cells results in the formation of hybrid cells, known as hybridomas, which grow continuously and secrete antibodies. Such cells may be selected, after cloning, for the stable secretion of antibodies of defined specificities. The continuous culture of these cloned cell lines allows the preparation of monoclonal antibodies in large quantities. Monoclonal antibodies produced in this way are available for a variety of therapeutic purposes, such as anti-tumour therapy, immunomodulation and passive immunization, as well as for in viva diagnosis and preparative procedures for biologicals. The requirements set out below are intended to apply to monoclonal antibodies, obtained from hybridomas of murine origin, for therapeutic and in viva diagnostic use in humans. Monoclonal antibodies intended for use in the purification of other products should be shown to be pure and free from adventitious agents by the methods described in this document. Monoclonal antibodies to be used for diagnostic purposes in vitro are not the concern of this paper.",

These may result in adverse reactions and limit the duration of effective antibody therapy. It may be prudent to minimize the murine protein load administered to the patient by the use of a parental myeloma cell which does not itself synthesize immunoglobulin chains. A flexible approach to the control of monoclonal antibodies should be adopted so that requirements can be modified in the light of further experience gained in their production and clinical use. Details of the implementation of these requirements for an individual product will generally reflect the circumstances in which the product will be used, for example, the clinical indication.",

Several of the requirements relating to establishments in which biological products are manufactured (e.g. revised Requirements for Biological Substances No. 1; WHO, TRS 323: Requirements for Manufacturing Establishments and Control Laboratories) apply to the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies. Attention is drawn to the following points. Production areas should be decontaminated before they are used for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies. The production of monoclonal antibodies should be performed only by staff whose state of health does not compromise the quality of the product and who are not otherwise involved in work which could result in infectious agents being transmitted to the monoclonal antibody product. Persons not directly concerned with the production processes, other than official representatives of the national control authority, should not be permitted to enter the production area. Particular emphasis should be given to the recommendations contained in Part A, section 1, Revised Requirements for Biological Substances No. 1 (WHO TRS 323, page 13) regarding the training and experience of persons in charge of production and testing and of those assigned to various areas of responsibility in the manufacturing establishment.",

Information about the cross-reactivity of the conjugate, as well as of the antibody itself, would be required, as would data concerning the toxicity and stability of the conjugate. Modification of the antibody could potentially change its antigenic specificity and this should be examined in detail with particular reference to the presence of any unintentional reactivity of the modified antibody with human tissues (Appendix II). For some applications sub-fragments of antibody, e.g. Fab or F(ab')*, may have advantages. Where such fragments are preferred for clinical use, their molecular and antigenic properties should be defined. If F(ab')z or Fab is used, specified limits for impurities, for example fragments other than those desired or intact immunoglobulin, should be defined and should comply with definitions of existing immunoglobulin preparations. The information described under section 7.1 should be provided. Upper limits should be set for residual levels in the product of enzymes used in such processes (e.g. pepsin or papain).",

Viruses for which evidence exists of a capacity to infect man or primates are to be found in Group I. Those viruses for which there is no evidence of infection in man but which could nevertheless pose a potential danger, for example in immunocompromised individuals, are listed in Group II. Testing for virusus should be performed in laboratories with experience in routine virus testing and should be performed in accordance with good laboratory practice. (c) Tests in animals for adventitious agents should include the inoculation by the intramuscular route of each of the following groups of animals with the test material or with disrupted cells from the seed lot propagated beyond the maximum level (or population doubling, as appropriate) used for production:two litters of suckling mice, comprising at least 10 animals less than 24 h old 10 adult mice five guinea-pigs.Test material should also be injected intracerebrally into each of 10 adult mice. The animals should be observed for at least four weeks. Any animals chat are sick or show any abnormality should be investigated to establish the cause of illness. Test material can be considered to be suitable for production ifat least 80% ofthe animals inoculated remain healthy and survive the observation period and none of the animals shows evidence of the presence in the tested material of any adventitious agent.Fertilized eggs may also act as useful substrates. Test material should be injected into eggs by appropriate roures, the chorioallantoic membrane, amniotic cavity and yolk sack of each of 10 embryonated chicken eggs, 9-l 1 days old. The embryonated eggs should be examined after not less than five days incubation. The allantoic fluids should be tested with guinea-pig and chick or other avian red cells for the presence of haemaglutinins.",
