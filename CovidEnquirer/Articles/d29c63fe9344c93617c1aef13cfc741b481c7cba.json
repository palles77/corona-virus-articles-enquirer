            "text": "The stomach is a pouch-shaped organ positioned transversely between the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the pylorus. The stomach has four functionally distinct anatomic and functional regions ( Figure 5-1 ). The cardia, fundus, and body are located to the left of midline, whereas the antrum lies mostly in a transverse position to the right of midline. Convergence of muscles of the esophagus and stomach forms the gastric inlet or cardia. The main function of the LES and cardia is to allow entry of ingesta into the stomach while preventing reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. The fundus is the dome-shaped portion of the stomach located left and dorsal to the cardia. The fundus dilates during gastric filling to accommodate a volume of ingesta without increasing intragastric pressure. The body is the large middle portion of the stomach extending from the cardia and fundus to the antrum. The body stores ingesta and secretes hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and lipase for the initial phase of digestion. The distal third of the stomach is the tubularshaped antrum, which extends from the incisura angularis of the lesser curvature to the pylorus. The pylorus is the most distal and narrowly tubular part of the stomach. The pylorus is composed of a thick muscular wall to form the small-lumen pyloric sphincter, which connects to the duodenum. The primary function of the antrum is to grind food into smaller particles, whereas the pylorus limits the size of food particles that pass into the duodenum and prevents reflux of duodenal contents into the stomach.",

The mucosa consists of the surface epithelium, the glandular lamina propria, and the muscularis layer. Columnar surface epithelial cells of the mucosa secrete copious amounts of mucus and bicarbonate that protect the underlying tissue from the damaging effects of luminal acid and proteolytic pepsin. The lamina propria contains glands composed of columnar epithelial cells that are functionally different in each part of the stomach. Glands in the cardia secrete mucus and pepsinogens, whereas glands in the fundus and body have parietal cells that secrete hydrochloric acid and chief cells that secrete pepsinogens. These chemicals hydrolyze dietary proteins and inactivate ingested microbes. Glands in the antrum also secrete pepsinogens and mucus and contain specialized G cells that secrete gastrin, which is a potent secretagogue for acid production. The muscularis consists of an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer of smooth muscle, with a thin oblique muscle layer in between. The thickness of the muscular coat increases distally through 5 DISEASES OF THE STOMACH Robert C. DeNovo C H A P T E R the stomach, reaching maximum thickness at the pylorus.

Esophagogastric and gastroduodenal motility is coordinated by the esophageal myenteric plexus, which is continuous with the gastric myenteric plexus, which is continuous with that of the pylorus and small intestine. Gastric storage, mixing, grinding, and transport functions all require different types of motility. Gastric filling stimulates stretch receptors in the fundus and body to cause gastric relaxation, facilitating reservoir function without causing increased intragastric pressure. Mixing and grinding of food and transport of liquid and small food particles to the pylorus occur as several peristaltic contractions per minute travel from the gastric body to the antrum. As a peristaltic wave approaches the pylorus, small amounts of liquid chyme pass into the duodenum. The pylorus then closes, and larger particles remain in the antrum and gastric body for additional digestion. High concentration of carbohydrate, protein, or fat entering the duodenum stimulates pyloric closure to slow gastric emptying and prevent small intestinal overload.",

            "text": "The stomach is well protected from the damaging effects of gastric acid, pepsin, bile acids, and other digestive enzymes by a complex of physical and chemical components known as the gastric mucosal barrier (GMB). The most superficial component of the GMB is a thick mucusbicarbonate layer secreted by gastric epithelial cells. Surface mucus acts as a lubricant to prevent mechanical damage. An underlying glycoprotein gel adheres to the mucosa and traps bicarbonate secreted by epithelial cells to maintain surface mucosal pH above 6. This layer provides an electricalchemical barrier to impede diffusion of luminal acid and pepsin into the epithelium. Gastric epithelial cells have low permeability to water and ions and have tight intercellular junctions, features that also inhibit diffusion of luminal chemicals into the epithelium. Another important feature of the GMB is the ability of gastric epithelial cells to continually and rapidly repair injured cells, a characteristic known as epithelial restitution. In the event of superficial mucosal injury, cells at the edge of the damaged area migrate over the defect within a few hours to prevent deeper damage to the mucosa. A dense network of submucosal capillaries supplies oxygen and nutrients to meet the high metabolic demands of mucus and bicarbonate secretion and of rapid cellular renewal. Perhaps the most important component of the GMB is prostaglandin produced by the GI mucosa. Prostaglandin E increases mucus and bicarbonate secretion, regulates mucosal blood flow, stimulates epithelial cell growth, and inhibits acid secretion. The collective effect is to enhance rapid epithelial restitution, to prevent damage to the surface mucosa, and to prevent progression of damage deeper into the submucosa.",

Vomiting, hematemesis, melena, anorexia, abdominal pain, and distention are the predominant signs of gastric disease, whereas diarrhea and weight loss occur less frequently. Vomiting is considered to be the hallmark of gastric disease. Unfortunately, most owners do not distinguish between vomiting and regurgitation when describing the problem and will also confuse vomiting with dysphagia, gagging, or coughing. Most patients that are diagnosed with esophageal disease at the University of Tennessee Veterinary Teaching Hospital initially have vomiting instead of regurgitation as the pri-mary owner complaint. To avoid misinterpretation of clinical signs, the owner must be questioned carefully to distinguish between what has been observed versus the owner's interpretation of those observations. Characteristics helpful in differentiating among vomiting, regurgitation, and dysphagia are listed in Table 5-1. Hematemesis and melena are commonly caused by gastric bleeding from erosive or ulcerative gastric disease (Box 5-3) but can also be caused by esophageal or small intestinal bleeding. Digested blood in the vomitus is typical of gastric bleeding, whereas fresh blood is more likely to be of oral or esophageal origin. Black stool can result from bleeding from any portion of the upper GI tract; however, gastric bleeding is the most common cause of melena. Coagulopathy should always be ruled out in any patient with hematemesis or melena.",

These changes, however, do not reliably indicate the cause of the problem. Dehydration is the most common problem caused by vomiting. Hypokalemia frequently occurs as a result of loss of potassium both in the vomitus and urine, coupled with lack of dietary intake. Hypochloremia occurs from loss of chloride-rich gastric secretions and from reduction of chloride reabsorption in the distal nephron that occurs when the patient is hypokalemic. The acid-base status of the vomiting patient can be acidotic, alkalotic, or normal depending on the composition of the vomitus and the presence of dehydration, lactic acidosis, or metabolic disease such as renal insufficiency. Many vomiting patients have normal acid-base status because of simultaneous loss of gastric hydrochloric acid and bicarbonate-rich duodenal juice. Others will have metabolic acidosis caused by dehydration, prerenal azotemia, and lactic acidosis from decreased tissue perfusion. Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis indicates that loss of a substantial amount of gastric contents has occurred and is most indicative of gastric outflow obstruction. Duodenal or biliary obstruction, acute pancreatitis, or renal failure can cause similar imbalances from loss of large quantities of gastric juice. If the vomiting patient is hyperkalemic, hypoadrenocorticism and oliguric or anuric renal failure are the most likely causes of the vomiting. Occasionally, severe intestinal disease caused by trichuriasis or by bacterial enterocolitis will mimic hypoadrenocorticism, causing a syndrome of vomiting and diarrhea and hyponatremia-hyperkalemia that is typical of hypoadrenocorticism.",

Survey radiographs identify foreign bodies and gastric distention, displacement, or malposition. Gastric distention with gas is common in an excited or struggling patient due to aerophagia or in patients with dyspnea, but it can also occur with GDV. Simple aerophagia causes a large but normally positioned and nontympanic stomach. GDV causes a tense and malpositioned stomach in a patient with signs of retching and vomiting. The major radiographic feature of GDV is gas and fluid distention of the stomach, with displacement of the pylorus dorsally and to the left. Radiographic determination of the location of the pylorus is the essential differentiating feature between simple gastric dilation and GDV. This is best accomplished by comparing left and right lateral recumbent views ( Figure  5-2, A and B) . A stomach distended with fluid or ingesta in a patient that has been fasted overnight is indicative of delayed gastric emptying.

A B masses, ulceration, or evidence of delayed gastric emptying can usually be identified. Filling the stomach with air to provide negative contrast can help to identify foreign bodies, gastric wall masses, or deep ulcers. Positive contrast gastrography using premixed barium sulfate is more reliable. Barium should be given by stomach tube to the fasted patient; recommended doses are 4 to 6 ml/lb for small dogs and cats and 2 to 4 ml/lb for large dogs. Ventrodorsal, right lateral, and left lateral radiographs should be taken within 5 minutes of giving the barium and repeated in 20 to 30 minutes. Liquid barium should be observed in the duodenum within 5 to 20 minutes, and the stomach should be nearly empty within 3 hours. If barium does not enter the duodenum within 30 minutes, or if the stomach remains barium filled with no evidence of peristalsis, a gastric motility disorder or gastric outflow obstruction should be suspected ( Figure 5-3, A) . The presence of a persistently narrowed stream of barium at the pylorus is suggestive of pyloric obstruction from hypertrophy, neoplasia, or inflammatory disease ( Figure 5-3 , B and C). Atropine, aminopentamide, ketamine, and xylazine will significantly slow gastric emptying, giving the false impression of gastric outlet obstruction.

Liver insufficiency results in decreased gastric mucus production, decreased gastric epithelial cell renewal, and decreased gastric blood flow. These factors, coupled with an increase in serum bile acid concentration that stimulates gastrin and gastric acid secretion, can cause significant GEU. Injury to gastric epithelial cells and submucosal vessels by uremic toxins and by decreased renal metabolism of gastrin account for GEU that occurs in acute and chronic renal failure. Adrenocortical insufficiency, in which mucosal damage is likely caused by hypotension and loss of vascular tone, is an infrequent cause of GEU.

Most dogs with MCT do not have clinical signs of GEU at the time of diagnosis. However, surgical manipulation or aggressive palpation can cause massive mast cell degranulation and release of histamine. Corticosteroids, which are sometimes used to treat MCT, can further predispose to GEU and occasionally cause gastric perforation.",

Severe gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, esophageal ulceration, chronic gastritis, duodenitis, and proximal duodenal ulceration will typically occur. Gastrinoma should be considered in any adult dog that has chronic vomiting, weight loss, diarrhea, melena, and/or signs of esophagitis. Increased fasting concentration of serum gastrin is diagnostic. Other causes of increased gastrin concentration that must be considered when interpreting serum gastrin results include renal failure and conditions that cause chronic gastric distention. In addition, treatment with proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole) that have potent acidsuppressing effects will cause increased gastrin production because of the lack of negative feedback of acid on gastrin-secreting cells in the pyloric antrum. Treatment for gastrinoma requires tumor removal (partial pancreatectomy), which can be curative if no metastasis has occurred. Medical management requires use of the proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole to maximally suppress acid secretion and control symptoms. Therapy is indefinite. Patients with metastatic disease and those not controlled with acid-suppressing drugs alone can be treated with octreotide (Sandostatin), an antisecretory drug that inhibits gastrin secretion.",

The drugs listed in Table 5 -4 were developed primarily for the treatment of gastric ulcer disease. However, they are very useful to treat a broad variety of disorders, including esophagitis, gastritis, and GI bleeding, as well as GEU. Suppression of gastric acid promotes healing of damaged mucosa and diminishes the proteolytic effects of gastric pepsin, which is most active in an acid environment. Cytoprotectants and prostaglandin analogues strengthen mucosal defenses. Promotility drugs reduce gastroesophageal and enterogastric reflux and help to control vomiting. Antiemetic therapies are designed to diminish either the humoral or neural pathways of the vomiting and are recommended for short-term use to provide patient comfort and to reduce fluid and electrolyte losses. Antisecretory Drugs. Histamine, gastrin, and acetylcholine stimulate the gastric parietal cell to secrete acid; simultaneous stimulation by all three causes maximal acid secretion. H 2 -receptor antagonists competitively and reversibly bind to H 2receptors on acid-producing gastric parietal cells to block the acid-stimulating effects of histamine and to render the cell less responsive to stimulation by acetylcholine and gastrin. Because these drugs are competitive inhibitors, they suppress but do not eliminate gastric secretion. The H 2 -receptor antagonists cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine, and famotidine are useful to treat gastritis and GEU in dogs and cats. All are effective and differ primarily in acid-suppressing potency, frequency of dosing, and in prokinetic effects. Cimetidine is the least potent and must be given three to four times daily to achieve adequate acid suppression. Ranitidine and nizatidine both have about 5 times the potency of cimetidine. Ranitidine must be given twice daily, whereas nizatidine needs to be given only once daily. Famotidine is the most potent H 2 -receptor antagonist, being approximately 20 times more potent that cimetidine, and requires only once-daily dosing.",

However, these drugs improve gastric emptying and decrease enterogastric reflux, thereby helping to prevent damage to the gastric mucosa from refluxed bile acids and pancreatic enzymes. Metoclopramide is especially effective because it has both central antiemetic and peripheral gastric prokinetic effects. The antiemetic effect is mediated through antagonism of dopaminergic D 2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ) of the medulla to inhibit vomiting induced by drugs, toxins, metabolic disease, and acid-base imbalances. Because serotonin receptors predominate in the CRTZ of the cat, metoclopramide does not appear to be as effective as a centrally acting antiemetic in the cat as in the dog. The prokinetic effect of metoclopramide is mediated through stimulation of serotonergic 5-HT 4 receptors on GI smooth muscle to improve coordination of antral, pyloric, and duodenal contractions. The primary prokinetic effects are to accelerate gastric emptying of liquids and to decrease duodenogastric reflux, whereas gastric emptying time of solids does not appear to be shortened. Metoclopramide is more effective as a centrally acting antiemetic than it is as a prokinetic drug. It is best used to control vomiting caused by nonspecific gastritis, uremia, and chemotherapy. The peripheral effects of metoclopramide to prevent gastric stasis and duodenogastric reflux, and to inhibit retrograde peristalsis that precedes vomiting, further help to diminish the severity of vomiting. Metoclopramide is administered parenterally to the vomiting patient at 0.1 to 0.25 mg/lb body weight every 8 hours. Constant intravenous infusion of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/lb body weight per 24 hours is usually more effective to initially control vomiting, particularly in patients with severe vomiting. Metoclopramide should not be used if gastric outlet obstruction or GI perforation is suspected or if the patient has a seizure disorder. Some patients are very sensitive to the effects of this drug and will actually have increased vomiting, presumably caused by excessive gastric contractions. Central effects of metoclopramide can also cause behavioral changes in some patients, ranging from lethargy in some to hyperactivity and agitated behavior in others. These effects can occur at recommended dosages and occur most frequently in cats. Pacing, vocalization, aggressive or agitated behavior, chewing at an intravenous catheter, and excessive panting are signs that should alert the clinician to sensitivity to or overdosage of metoclopramide. Side effects usually resolve when the drug is discontinued. However, if central nervous system (CNS) signs are severe, treatment with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) at 1 to 2 mg/lb intravenously will effectively reverse the side effects without altering promotility effects of the drug. Because metoclopramide is excreted by the kidneys, the dosage should be reduced by 50% in patients with renal failure.",

Unfortunately, cisapride has been taken off the market in the United States because of an association with fatal arrhythmias in humans. No reports of similar complications occurring in the dog or cat exist. The future availability of this drug for veterinary use is uncertain, which is unfortunate because cisapride does have distinct advantages compared with metoclopramide. However, it is currently readily available through compounding pharmacies. Cisapride does not cross the blood-brain barrier; therefore it does not have the central antiemetic properties or CNS side effects of metoclopramide. Consequently, animals that experience metoclopramide-associated CNS side effects can be switched to cisapride without concern that the same side effects will occur. Cisapride accelerates gastric emptying by stimulating both pyloric and duodenal motor activity, by enhancing antropyloroduodenal coordination, and by increasing the propagation distance of duodenal contractions. As a result, this drug is much more effective than metoclopramide in enhancing gastric emptying, particularly that of solids. In addition, cisapride stimulates smooth muscle contraction throughout the GI tract, from the distal esophagus to the colon. In species such as the cat that have a smooth muscle component to the distal esophagus, distal esophageal contraction and gastroesophageal sphincter tone are enhanced.

Many regimens have been developed to treat Helicobacter gastritis in humans, using one to three antibiotics in combination with an antisecretory drug and/or a bismuth-containing compound. Acid suppression renders the organism more susceptible to the effects of antibiotics, and bismuth has antimicrobial activity against Helicobacter. Multiple-drug therapy using various combinations of metronidazole or bismuth with an antibiotic (tetracycline, amoxicillin, or azithromycin) and an antisecretory drug (H 2receptor antagonist or omeprazole), given for 10 to 14 days, is considered to be the most effective treatment in humans. However, compliance and side effects are limitations to these multidrug treatments. Dual-therapy protocols using amoxicillinomeprazole or azithromycin-omeprazole for 10 to 14 days are similar in efficacy to the three-or fourdrug protocols in humans. Several two-, three-, and four-drug protocols have been extrapolated for use in dogs and cats. In my experience, dual therapy using amoxicillin or azithromycin in combination with omeprazole for 14 days is effective, well tolerated, and economical. The following is a suggested protocol for treatment of dogs and cats:",

Infrequency of diagnosis might be explained in part by difficulty finding the ova or adult parasites. Diagnosis of Physaloptera rara in the dog by fecal flotation is difficult because few ova are shed. Diagnosis of Ollulanus tricuspis, the gastric nematode of cats, is also difficult and requires examination of the vomitus for adult parasites. The increased use of endoscopy in chronically vomiting animals has revealed that gastric nematodes might be a more common cause of chronic gastritis than was once thought. In our hospital, gastric parasites have been diagnosed via endoscopy in several dogs and cats with chronic vomiting where the only abnormality found was a single parasite attached to the gastric mucosa. Treatment for these parasites has resolved the clinical signs. Adult worms are easily identified as 1-to 4-cm-long nematodes in the fundus or antrum, but the smaller larvae are difficult to visualize. Some parasitized animals have gastric erosions and moderate lymphocytic-plasmacytic or eosinophilic gastritis. Because nonendoscopic diagnosis is difficult, it is advisable to treat chronically vomiting dogs and cats that are not systemically ill for gastric parasites before recommending extensive diagnostic tests and endoscopy. Treatment with a single dose of pyrantel pamoate (2.3 mg/lb orally) eliminates Physaloptera from dogs, whereas cats require two doses (2.3 mg/lb) given 3 weeks apart. Treatment for Ollulanus is uncertain; however, fenbendazole (4.5 mg/lb every 24 hours for 2 days) appears to be effective in cats.",

Three types have been described based on histologic appearance. Diffuse superficial gastritis is characterized by mucosal infiltrate with lymphocytes and plasma cells, often involving full thickness of the mucosa. Atrophic gastritis is characterized by severe inflammatory infiltrate with reduced mucosal parenchyma and loss of gastric glands and prominent fibrosis. Hypertrophic gastritis is characterized by diffuse or focal mucosal hypertrophy with variable inflammatory infiltrate and fibrosis (see discussion of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy). Plasmacytic-lymphocytic gastritis usually occurs as part of the more diffuse syndrome of IBD and likely has a similar etiopathogenesis. A permeability defect in the gastric mucosal barrier, possibly caused by dietary sensitivity, druginduced damage, or infection, might allow abnormal absorption of luminal antigens into the mucosa, thereby initiating an immune-mediated response. Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings are nonspecific, and diagnosis is based on results of biopsy. Severe lymphocytic infiltrate can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from gastric lymphoma, particularly when evaluating small endoscopic biopsy specimens. Treatment is essentially symptomatic, centering on dietary protein change coupled with immunosuppressive therapy (Box 5-6).",

Dietary change using a diet consisting of a novel protein that has not been part of that animal's previous diet (e.g., fish, venison, rabbit, cottage cheese) may help control the disease but is seldom effective as the sole treatment. Most patients require initial treatment with corticosteroids, and sometimes with azathioprine, to gain clinical remission. Much individual variation in response to treatment occurs. For dogs, initial treatment with prednisone, 0.5 mg/lb every 12 hours orally for 7 to 10 days, followed by an additional 7 to 10 days at 0.5 mg/lb every 24 hours orally is usually effective to induce a remission of clinical signs. The dose should then tapered to an alternate-day treatment for the next several weeks. Depending on the clinical response, prednisone dosage is further tapered by 50% decrements until it can be discontinued without recurrence of clinical signs. Cats tend to require a higher initial dosage, usually 1 to 2 mg/lb every 12 hours orally for 10 to 14 days, followed by gradually tapering doses for the next several months. Occasionally some patients do not respond well to corticosteroids or will require unacceptably high dosages to maintain remission. In this instance azathioprine is a good alternative or can be used as an adjunct to corticosteroids. In dogs azathioprine can be started at a dose of 0.45 mg/lb every 24 hours orally for 10 to 14 days. At the same time the daily dose of corticosteroid is decreased by 50%. Azathioprine and prednisone are then alternated on a daily basis. Depending on the response, the corticosteroid dose can gradually be tapered and eventually eliminated. Remission may require continued alternateday treatment with azathioprine. Cats are very sensitive to myelotoxic and hepatotoxic effects of azathioprine; a low dose of 0.1 to 0.2 mg/lb every 48 hours is usually safe in cats. Reversible bone marrow suppression, usually occurring within the first 2 to 6 weeks of therapy, is the most common side effect of azathiaprine. A CBC should be done every 14 days during the first 2 months of therapy and at monthly intervals thereafter. If neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurs, the drug should be stopped. Less frequent side effects are vomiting, hepatopathy, and rarely pancreatitis. The long-term prognosis for most patients with lymphocyticplasmacytic and eosinophilic gastritis is good. Most respond well to corticosteroids and dietary changes, although some cats do not respond to even aggressive treatment. Remission can often be maintained with carefully controlled diets; however, long-term low-dose corticosteroid or azathioprine therapy is necessary in some. Rarely some patients have large eosinophilic granulomatous masses that initially require surgical resection to relieve partial luminal obstruction. These patients respond surprisingly well postoperatively but still require dietary and immunosuppressive treatment.",

Bradygastria causes infrequent gastric contraction, whereas tachygastria can cause reversed propagation of motor activity, which prevents normal emptying. Gastric dysrhythmias have been observed to occur normally in healthy dogs during fasting, whereas feeding will abolish the dysrhythmia. Animals symptomatic for gastric dysrhythmias are presented for signs of post prandial abdominal discomfort, bloating, or chronic vomiting. Diagnosis requires documentation of gastric retention and elimination of obstructive and metabolic causes of delayed gastric emptying (Figure 5-8 ; see color plate).

            "text": "Treatment relies on a combination of dietary changes and prokinetic drugs to improve gastric emptying (Box 5-8). Surgical procedures are generally not successful to improve gastric emptying for patients with primary functional gastric motility disorders. Liquified or blenderized diets are useful to try because liquids empty from the stomach more rapidly than solids. Because fats and proteins delay gastric emptying, diets low in fat and protein and high in carbohydrates should be tried initially for patients with suspected functionally delayed gastric emptying. If dietary changes are unsuccessful, gastric prokinetic drugs should be added to the therapeutic plan. Different prokinetic drugs have different modes of action and therefore have different effects on gastric, pyloric, and duodenal contractions. For that reason, whether a particular drug is effective in improving motility depends on both the specific effects of that drug and how the underlying abnormality is affecting gastric motility. In general, cisapride has been considered to be the most effective prokinetic drug because it accelerates gastric emptying in dogs by stimulating both pyloric and duodenal motor activity, by improving coordination among antral, pyloric, and duodenal contractions, and by increasing propagation distance of duodenal contractions. The result is a predictable promotility effect, particularly in the upper GI tract, with no significant adverse effects being reported in dogs or cats. Because of the uncertain availability of cisapride, other drugs, including metoclopramide, erythromycin, and ranitidine, are alternatives to consider for treatment of delayed gastric emptying. Metoclopramide is not as effective as cisapride in accelerating gastric emptying. However, it does enhance coordination of gastropyloroduodenal contractions to improve gastric emptying of liquids and to prevent gastric stasis and enterogastric reflux. Metoclopramide also inhibits dopaminergic D 2 receptors in the CRTZ to diminish central stimulation of nausea and vomiting that can occur from delayed gastric emptying. Another alternative is erythromycin, which at low dosages will induce antral contractions and accelerate gastric emptying of solids. The contractions stimulated by erythromycin are similar to those that normally occur in the fasting state to empty the stomach of nondigestible solids. As a result, treatment with erythromycin might result in larger than normal and less-digested food particles being expelled into the duodenum, which could possibly cause worsening of the GI signs. The H 2 -receptor antagonists ranitidine and nizatidine are Results of gastric mucosal biopsies were normal, and the dog was diagnosed with primary (idiopathic) gastric motility disorder. Clinical signs improved, but did not resolve, when the dog was treated with cisapride and dietary management (small meals, fatrestricted food). (See color plate.) used primarily to inhibit gastric acid secretion. These drugs also stimulate GI motility by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase activity, thereby increasing the amount of acetylcholine available to bind to smooth muscle muscarinic receptors. The result is primarily stimulation of gastric emptying, with some increase in small intestinal and colonic motility. The choice of which prokinetic drug to use first depends in part on whether an underlying cause has been identified. For example, ranitidine and nizatidine are useful in the treatment of gastric motility disorders associated with gastric ulcerative or inflammatory diseases where both acid suppression and stimulation of gastric emptying are beneficial. Metabolic causes of delayed gastric emptying such as uremia or diabetic ketoacidosis, where central stimulation of vomiting might also occur, and gastric hypomotility following surgery for GDV tend to respond well to treatment with metoclopramide. If an underlying abnormality cannot be identified, the choice of treatment is trial and error. In general, cisapride (if available) should be tried initially, with erythromycin being a second choice. Metoclopramide and ranitidine or nizatidine are considered if inadequate response is achieved with the initial treatment.",

Some patients with functional dysrhythmias that respond to prokinetic drugs may require treatment indefinitely, perhaps at lower or less frequent dosing than the standard recommendations, whereas other patients might eventually be weaned off therapy. To determine if a lower drug dose is adequate requires individualized treatment for each patient. A suggested protocol is to first decrease the frequency of dosing (e.g., if a drug is being given three times a day, decrease to two times a day; if being given two times a day, decrease to every day). If clinical signs are adequately controlled for several days, alternate-day treatment can then be tried. If signs are still controlled, discontinuing the drug should be considered.

Deep-chested breeds of dogs appear to have an increased potential for rotational instability of the stomach, in part because of laxity of hepatoduodenal and hepatogastric ligaments. Large-volume intake of food and water causes chronic gastric distention that can potentially impair gastric emptying. Exercise with a distended stomach, particularly in deep-chested dogs, might subsequently cause the stomach to become displaced and result in volvulus. Dietary composition, particularly feeding dry-food diets, has also been suggested as a contributing factor to GDV; however, a direct relationship has not been established. The incidence of GDV was reported to decline when dry food was dampened before feeding, presumably preventing swelling of dry food with water in the stomach. Aerophagia from rapid eating, hyperventilation, and esophageal motility abnormalities have also been associated with recurrent GDV. Impaired eructation may result from an anatomically or functionally abnormal gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) in deep-chested dogs. The oblique angle of the GEJ may become exaggerated, especially if the stomach is distended following a large meal, preventing normal eructation.",

Radiographic determination of the location of the pylorus is the key feature to differentiate gastric dilation from gastric volvulus.

Gastric volvulus usually results in displacement of the pylorus dorsally and to the left, creating a shelflike partition of soft tissue that appears to compartmentalize the stomach. With the pylorus shifted to the left and the patient in left lateral recumbency, the pylorus fills with fluid and gas fills the rest of the stomach. However, when the patient is in right recumbency, gas fills the pyloric portion and fluid shifts to the fundus or body of the stomach. The finding that the pylorus fills with fluid when in the left lateral recumbent position and fills with gas when in the right lateral recumbent position indicates that the pylorus has rotated to the left. The presence of abdominal fluid is suggestive of peritonitis or hemorrhage, and air in the abdominal space indicates that perforation has occurred. Megaesophagus is a common finding.",

Because these drugs block the final step of hydrogen ion secretion, they prevent secretion of gastric acid stimulated by histamine, acetylcholine, and gastrin. These drugs noncompetitively block the proton pump and therefore are much more potent than the H 2 -receptor antagonists. Proton pump inhibitors accumulate in the parietal cell and increase with each dose until acid secretion is almost totally inhibited after the fifth dose. Because of this delay in gastric acid suppression, H 2 -receptor antagonists should be used concurrently with proton pump inhibitors for the first 3 to 4 days of treatment in patients where rapid acid suppression is needed.Proton pump inhibitors are recommended for the treatment of severe esophagitis and GEU that has not responded to therapy with H 2 -receptor antagonists and sucralfate. They are recommended as the drugs of choice for treatment of patients with hypersecretion of gastric acid that occurs with MCT and gastrinoma. Omeprazole and lansoprazole are similar in potency, are given once daily, cause no clinical, hematologic, or biochemical abnormalities, and are safe to use in cats and dogs.Sucralfate is a sulfated disaccharide-aluminum hydroxide complex that accelerates gastric mucosal healing by adhering to mucosal erosions 174 CHAPTER 5 DISEASES OF THE STOMACHAntiemetic Drugs and Dosages",

Depending on patient response, crystalloid fluid should be resumed at a rate of 10 to 20 ml/lb/hr for the next 2 hours and then decreased to 5 to 10 ml/lb/hr. Pulse quality, capillary refill, central venous pressure, and urinary output should be used as a guide for continued fluid needs. The packed cell volume and plasma total protein concentration should be monitored hourly to avoid hemodilution (total plasma protein concentration should not decrease to less than 3.5 g/dl). Following gastric decompression, the fluid rate can usually be decreased to 5 ml/lb/hr, depending on patient stability. Hetastarch can be repeated within 6 to 12 hours if needed to maintain perfusion. If the plasma protein concentration decreases to less than 3.5 g/dl, a plasma transfusion (10 ml/lb) should be given. Gastric decompression must be accomplished immediately, occurring as soon as intravenous fluid therapy has begun. Decompression is achieved either by passage of a stomach tube or by gastric trocarization. Trocarization is easier and better tolerated by the patient than gastric intubation; rarely does it cause peritonitis. A 16-gauge 2-inch needle or 14-to 16-gauge over-the-needle catheter is used to trocarize the stomach on the left side at the site of maximal distention. Partial decompression in this manner often facilitates passage of a large-bore orogastric tube for more complete decompression and for gastric lavage. Once a gastric tube is passed, gastric contents should be removed. If possible, the tube should be left in place while radiographs are taken. If the stomach tube is difficult to pass, attempts should be made to pass the tube while holding the patient in an upright or sitting position. Gently shaking the patient while in the upright position may help. Forcing the tube can cause esophageal or gastric perforation. Inability to pass the tube does not necessarily mean that volvulus is present, nor does the ability to pass the tube mean that volvulus is not present. Gastric decompression can also be achieved by gastrostomy, usually done under sedation and local anesthesia. This is a temporary procedure that fixes the stomach caudal to the right costal arch but does not return the stomach to normal position. It is indicated for patient stabilization if a gastric tube cannot be placed or if the patient needs several days of stabilization before surgical repositioning and gastropexy. As an alternative, gastric decompression can be done using an endoscope if passage of an orogastric tube has not been successful. The patient must be anesthetized for this procedure; either mask induction using an inhalant anesthetic or use of a short-acting injectable anesthetic is sufficient. Once decompression has been achieved, an oral-gastric tube can usually be placed to facilitate ongoing patient stabilization.",

            "text": "As soon as the clinical condition has been stabilized, surgery should be done to reposition and stabilize the stomach (Box 5-10). The optimal time for surgery to occur is variable, depending on patient condition and response to initial therapy. In general, surgery should not be delayed beyond the initial period of time required for stabilization. If gastric contents are noted to contain digested blood suggestive of gastric ulceration and/or necrosis, if there is radiographic evidence of perforation or peritonitis, if decompression cannot be achieved, or if decompression is difficult to maintain, surgery should not be delayed for more than 1 or 2 hours. If the patient responds well to initial therapy and decompression is sustained, surgery can be delayed for 12 to 24 hours if necessary. In this circumstance decompression must be maintained by nasogastric or pharyngostomy tubes, gastrostomy, or repeated orogastric intubation. Spontaneous repositioning of the stomach occurs infrequently following decompression. In this circumstance surgery can be delayed or may not be necessary.A gastropexy should be done to prevent recurrence of volvulus. A recent study determined that 55% of dogs that did not have gastropexy following surgery had a recurrence, compared with 4% recurrence for dogs that did have gastropexy. Median survival time was 188 days for dogs not having gastropexy, compared with 547 days for dogs that did have a gastropexy. Several types of gastropexy done through laparotomy have been described and include incisional gastropexy, circumcostal gastropexy, belt-loop gastropexy, and tube gastropexy. The benefit of doing a prophylactic gastropexy to prevent GDV in a dog that is conformationally or genetically predisposed has not been scientifically proven. It is logical, however, that gastropexy would be of benefit to prevent a first episode of GDV in such patients, as well as for patients in which an episode of GDV was managed medically. A rapid laparoscopic gastropexy technique that provides a strong fibrous adhesion between the stomach and abdominal wall has recently been described that could be used for this purpose, thereby eliminating the need for laparotomy.",
