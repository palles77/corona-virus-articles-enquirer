            "text": "Long RNA molecules are at the core of gene regulation across all kingdoms of life, while also serving as genomes in RNA viruses. Few studies have addressed the basic physical properties of long single-stranded RNAs. Long RNAs with nonrepeating sequences usually adopt highly ramified secondary structures and are better described as branched polymers. To test whether a branched polymer model can estimate the overall sizes of large RNAs, we employed fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to examine the hydrodynamic radii of a broad spectrum of biologically important RNAs, ranging from viral genomes to long noncoding regulatory RNAs. The relative sizes of long RNAs measured at low ionic strength correspond well to those predicted by two theoretical approaches that treat the effective branching associated with secondary structure formation-one employing the Kramers theorem for calculating radii of gyration, and the other featuring the metric of maximum ladder distance. Upon addition of multivalent cations, most RNAs are found to be compacted as compared with their original, low ionic-strength sizes. These results suggest that sizes of long RNA molecules are determined by the branching pattern of their secondary structures. We also experimentally validate the proposed computational approaches for estimating hydrodynamic radii of singlestranded RNAs, which use generic RNA structure prediction tools and thus can be universally applied to a wide range of long RNAs.",

Genome sequencing and high-throughput expression profiling have recently revealed novel long noncoding (lnc) RNAs, some of which are thousands of nucleotides long and are known to play important regulatory functions (5, 6) . For example, Xist lncRNA is a 17 kb-long transcript responsible for silencing one of the homologous pair of X chromosomes during mammalian development (7, 8) . Others, such as HOTAIR and NRON, are important regulators of gene expression (9) (10) (11) linked to diverse human diseases (12) . Furthermore, a vast number of important pathogenic viruses including HIV, SARS coronavirus, poliovirus, Dengue fever virus, and many others utilize long RNAs as genetic material, which also play structural roles during virus assembly and genome packaging (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . Previous studies have established the importance of local secondary and three-dimensional structure in the biological function of RNA (21, 22) . However, the effects of the secondary structure on the large-scale properties (e.g., size) of long RNAs remain poorly understood, even while its importance for virus assembly has been demonstrated (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .",

Coarse-grained properties of long dsRNAs are well described by semiflexible polymer models such as the wormlike chain (23) , which only take into account the overall contour length and average persistence length, the latter being weakly dependent on sequence or base composition. Similarly, the freely jointed chain model describes the conformational behavior of the more flexible single-stranded homopolymers (24, 25) . These models yield simple scaling laws, which relate the contour length (l) or a degree of polymerization (N, number of nucleotides) to the overall size, e.g., radius of gyration (R g ) or hydrodynamic radius (R h ):",

            "text": "Here n is a scaling exponent that depends on the polymer chain model (e.g., n \u00bc 0.5 for an ideal Gaussian chain, n \u00bc 0.59 for a self-avoiding chain, and n~1 for a stiff polyelectrolyte at low ionic strength), and b represents an effective segment length that is related to the persistence length (l p ) and describes polymer flexibility. Highly structured RNAs are described by a collapsed polymer chain model with n close to 0.33, also applicable to other compact biopolymers such as globular proteins (26, 27) . In contrast, due to extensive intramolecular basepairing arising from Watson-Crick complementarity of nucleotides separated by long distances along the chain contour, long ssRNAs fold into effectively branched structures with short duplex regions emanating from single-stranded loops (28) (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, given the plethora of possible basepairing scenarios, thermally equilibrated long RNAs are expected to display a large number of secondary structures in solution. Notable exceptions are RNAs in large ribonucleoprotein complexes such as in ribosomes (29) or virus capsids (15, (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . This view is supported by recent experiments confirming that protein-free viral genomic RNAs adopt an ensemble of branched conformations (28) , which are further compacted upon viral assembly (14, 20, 36, 37) . Hence, selecting out a unique (native) or representative conformation is less appropriate and useful than averaging over a statistical (thermal) ensemble of secondary structures, for obtaining a reasonable estimate of the overall RNA size.",

The sizes compare well with those predicted by two ensemble averaging methods that take into account the sequence-dependent effective branching of long RNAs. Furthermore, this correlation holds even in the presence of polyvalent cations that enhance tertiary interactions and result in measurable compaction of RNAs, suggesting that these polymer theory-based methods can successfully predict sizes of long RNA molecules under a variety of conditions. Both methods are based on generic RNA structure prediction algorithms and, accordingly, would be widely applicable to other long RNAs with known sequences.",

The resulting PCR product was then amplified using 5 0 -phosphorylated primers TCV_F2 and TCV_R2 (Table S1 ) to add a T7 promoter sequence to the 5 0 -end and an XhoI restriction site to the 3 0 -end. Further PCR product purification and cloning into pSMART HC Amp vector were performed the same way as described above for the other DNA templates. Templates for transcription of 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA (16SrRNA_ pSMART_HC Amp and 23SrRNA_ pSMART_HC Amp ) were produced by cloning the corresponding genes using genomic DNA extracted from E. coli BL21 cells. The primer pairs 16S_F1/16S_R1 and 23S_F1/23S_R1 (Table S1 ) were designed to amplify region 483879-485408 (16S ribosomal RNA, GenBank: CP001665.1) and region 228583-231490 (23S ribosomal RNA, GenBank: AM946981.2) of the BL21 DE3 E. coli genome.

This amplification resulted in incorporation of T7 promoter sequences at the 5 0 -ends of both PCR products and DraI (16S rRNA DNA) and HindIII (23S rRNA DNA) restriction sites at their respective 3 0 -ends. Further PCR product purification via agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent cloning into a pSMART HC Amp vector were performed as described above for other DNA templates.

Fig. 1 illustrates this mapping for a simple case: here duplexes are treated as rigid bonds of the same length-tree edges, and single-stranded flexible loops are treated as tree vertices. Hairpin loops are vertices of order one; loops, including bulges, connecting two duplexes are twofold vertices; and loops from which three or more duplexes emanate are branched vertices (see Fig. 1 A) . To calculate the size of the resulting branched polymer (Fig. 1 B) , two approaches can be used. The first method makes use of the Kramers theorem (41, 45, 46) to directly calculate R g from the tree topology. In the second method, the size is determined by identifying the longest chain of edges found within the tree-defined as the maximum ladder distance (MLD, Fig. 1 A) (42, 43) -and the branched tree is replaced by a linear chain with effective contour length (N eff ) proportional to the MLD. Treating the resulting linear polymer as an ideal chain then gives",

We note that while the measured R h broadly increases with the length, the rise significantly deviates from the monotonic behavior expected for the simple scaling laws (Eq. 1, Fig. 2 A) .

Long RNA molecules were transcribed and 5 0 (or 3 0 ; see Materials and Methods) end-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), purified and subsequently checked for integrity by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. S1) . In a few cases, quenching or aggregation affected or prevented determination of the diffusion correlation time. f Measured in 10 mM MgCl 2 in 20 mM MOPS-K \u00fe , pH 7. g Measured in 1 mM spermidine in 20 mM MOPS-K \u00fe , pH 7. h Computed by averaging over 100 predictions (5 SD). i Computed using Kramers theorem. and ensemble average over the low energy structures. The measured hydrodynamic radii are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates of the R g values based either on the MLD (Fig. 2 B, Eq. 3) or the Kramers theorem (Fig. 2 C) . This result is consistent with most RNA molecules adopting branched structures in which the MLD largely determines the overall size (41, 42) . This is illustrated by comparing the maximum ladder path of rotavirus segment 11 precursor (s11, Fig. 1 C) with that of MS2 phage genomic RNA (Fig. 1 D) . The experimentally determined secondary structure pattern of s11 is significantly less branched than that of the typical prediction for MS2. Furthermore, this is reflected in the relatively large MLD and hydrodynamic size of s11, comparable to that of Ef2 mRNA, which is three times the length. This demonstrates that the relatively simple MLD description can capture the essence of coarse-grained RNA structure, and yields quantitative predictions based on the RNA sequence alone. Further compaction of RNA molecules and the formation of tertiary structure require di-and polyvalent cations (Mg 2\u00fe , spermidine 3\u00fe , spermine 4\u00fe ) and/or association with RNA-binding proteins (54) . As seen in Table 1 , upon addition of divalent (10 mM Mg 2\u00fe ) or trivalent cations (1 mM spermidine, Sp 3\u00fe ), the measured R h decreases for most RNAs, consistent with compaction driven by electrostatic screening and neutralization. Fig. 3 compares R h before and after the addition of multivalent cations. The R h values cluster along the line with the slope between 0.7 and 0.8, indicating that on average the RNAs undergo a 20-25% size compaction compared to their original R h . As a consequence, the proportionality between R h and predicted size holds for most of the RNAs even after addition of polyvalent cations. However, there are few RNAs that either fail to further compact (RV s11 No. 1 and Ef2 mRNA No. 6 in Fig. 3 , where the R h change is insignificant at confidence level 90%) or the compaction is more prominent in comparison with other RNAs examined (HCV, No. 19 in Fig. 3 , where the R h differs significantly from the expected value at confidence level 99%).",

However, there are several notable discrepancies between the predicted and measured sizes. One limitation of our approach is that computational predictions may yield an incorrect structure and hence an MLD that differs from that of the experimentally determined secondary structure, as in the case of STMV RNA (21, 55) . Such failures of the computational approach are more likely (Table 1) and coloring is according to the class (black, single-stranded precursors of dsRNA viral genomes; red, genomes of ssRNA viruses; blue, cellular mRNAs; green, ribosomal RNA; and cyan, long noncoding RNAs. Lines and curves represent best fits to different linear polymer models: charged (red, Eq. 1, n \u00bc 1, reduced c 2 \u00bc 35.85), simple Gaussian coil (blue, Eq. 1, n \u00bc 0.5, reduced c 2 \u00bc 13.37), and a self-avoiding coil (green, Eq. 1, n \u00bc 0.59, reduced c 2 \u00bc 14.85). (B) Correlation between R h and R g predicted from hMLDi (in bp units); solid line is the best fit with reduced c 2 \u00bc 11.28. (C) Correlation between R h and R g predicted from Kramers theorem (in units of the average segment length, a.u.); solid line is the best fit with reduced c 2 \u00bc 12.74. RNA color coding and numbering is the same as in (A). Error bars were omitted for clarity; see Table 1 for standard deviations. To provide directly comparable reduced c 2 values, all fitting was performed using the same nonlinear Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in OriginPro (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). To see this figure in color, go online. to occur when long RNA sequences are analyzed, thus explaining the largest deviations observed for HCV and BunV L (>5 kb), the longest RNAs examined here (Fig. 2 B ; Table 1 ) (17, 28) . This situation can be remedied by estimating MLD from structure-probing data, which should improve the accuracy of RNA size calculations. This is demonstrated for s11 RNA for which the probingderived MLD exp is slightly lower than the computed average hMLDi (Fig. 1 C, compare hMLDi and MLD exp ) , yielding a R g~9 .3 value that agrees better with the experimental R h (i.e., point No. 1 would be closer to the trend line in Fig. 2 B) . On the other hand, when secondary structure determination (or prediction) is ambiguous, experimental size measurements by FCS can be used for selecting those structures with MLDs compatible with the experimentally determined hydrodynamic radii. In addition to the MLD prediction limitations, HCV RNA is compacted twofold in the presence of multivalent ions, i.e., to a much higher degree than other RNAs examined here (20-25% reduction), highlighting the importance of repulsive electrostatic interactions at low salt and formation of tertiary contacts stabilized by multivalent cations, not accounted for in our approach.",

While MS2 phage genomic and subgenomic ssRNAs (Nos. 9, 10, and 15 in Fig. 2 A) are comparable in length to lncRNAs (Nos. 8 and 11) and the protein-free ribosomal RNA (No. 12), they appear to be smaller in size (see 2-4 kb region in Fig. 2 A) . However, the Ef2 mRNA transcript (No. 6 ) is yet even more compact than the comparatively short viral RNAs (RNAs No. 4, 5, and 13 in Fig. 2 A) , suggesting that although there might be evolutionary pressure on genomes of ssRNA viruses to fold into more compact structures (17) , there is a number of exceptions, including more extended viral RNAs (21) and compact mRNAs. Moreover, relative size of viral RNAs may also reflect replication strategies and genome packaging mechanisms employed by viruses.

Coloring and numbering scheme is as in Fig. 2 . R h values that were compromised by either quenching or possible aggregation (RV s1 and s11 in Table 1 ) in the presence of multivalent cations were omitted from the plot. Linear regression lines with slopes 0.77 5 0.03, Pearson's r \u00bc 0.89 for Mg 2\u00fe and 0.73 5 0.04, and Pearson's r \u00bc 0.87 for Sp 3\u00fe , respectively, are shown.

Because the theoretical approaches used here treat exclusively the branching patterns associated with the RNA secondary structures, our results provide experimental evidence that the overall sizes of long RNAs are determined predominantly by their secondary structure branching patterns (17) . The effects of di-and polyvalent cations are more prominent for smaller RNAs, such as riboswitches and ribozymes, which adopt compact and unique tertiary structures in the presence of Mg 2\u00fe (59) via formation of specific tertiary contacts. Due to the heterogeneity of secondary structures in long RNAs, such specific contacts would be harder to achieve, while also explaining why long RNAs often require auxiliary proteins to guide their folding into a unique structure. This feature of RNA is likely to be the result of a limited repertoire of interactions offered by the four nucleobases and points to a fundamental limitation of RNA as a complex biopolymer when compared to proteins. We find that even relatively simple theoretical calculations based on ensembles of predicted secondary structures and MLD averaging correlate well with the experimental measurements for a diverse set of long RNA molecules, allowing our approach to account for the sizes and compactness of broad classes of ssRNAs.",

The immersion oil objective (63\u00c2 magnification, numerical aperture of 1.4; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) was used together with low autofluorescence immersion oil (refractive index 1.515, type DF; Cargille-Sacher Laboratories, Cedar Grove, NJ). The focus position was adjusted to 20 mm from the coverslip inner surface and precisely maintained by a piezoelectric feedback loop (Piezosystem, Jena, Germany). The photon count was recorded and analyzed by an ALV-5000 multiple tau digital correlator (www.alvgmbh.de) used in a single channel mode. Multiple runs of up to 100 autocorrelation functions with acquisition scan time of 30 s each were recorded for each of the samples using ALVcorrelator software (ALV-5000/E/EPP, Ver. 3.0). Calibration of the confocal volume was performed by measuring the diffusion time of AF488-SDP dye (1 nM in RNA measurement buffer) before each data set collection. FCS data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares fitting with a single-component diffusion model autocorrelation function corrected for the triplet state(14) using MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). Calculation of R h was based on the measured diffusion time value for AF488 dye and the established diffusion coefficient for a free dye using the Einstein-Stokes relationship.RNA measurements were performed with 0.5-2 nM RNA in RNase-free 20 mM 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), 10 mM KOH buffer, pH 7.0 with 1 mM dithiothreitol at 25 C. RNA condensation experiments were performed in the presence of divalent (10 mM MgCl 2 , Mg 2\u00fe ) and trivalent (1 mM spermidine chloride, Sp 3\u00fe ) cations, added to the 0.5-2 nM RNA samples before FCS measurements.",
