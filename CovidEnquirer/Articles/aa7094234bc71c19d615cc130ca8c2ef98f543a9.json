As the infrastructure of aviation industry, the airport network is one of the most important indicators of economic growth. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the Chinese airport network (CAN) via complex network theory. It is found that although the topology of CAN has remained steady during the past few years, there are many dynamic switchings inside the network, which have changed the relative importance of airports and airlines. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of traffic flow (passengers and cargoes) on CAN. It is found that the traffic continues to grow in an exponential form and has evident seasonal fluctuations. We also found that cargo traffic and passenger traffic are positively related but the correlations are quite different for different kinds of cities.",

Obviously, real networks are neither regular lattices nor simple random networks. Since the small-world network model [4] and the scale-free network model [5] were put forward at the end of the last century, people have found that many real complex networks are actually associated with the small-world property and a scale-free, power-law degree distribution. In the past ten years, the theory of complex networks has drawn continuous attention from diverse scientific communities, such as network modelling [6] [7] [8] , synchronization [9, 10] , information traffic [11] [12] [13] [14] , epidemic spreading [15, 16] , cascading failures [17] [18] [19] [20] , evolutionary games [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , social dynamics [26] etc. One interesting and important research direction is understanding transportation infrastructures in the framework of complex network theory [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .",

            "text": "In the past few years, some interesting research has been reported studying airport networks from the point of view of network theory. For example, Amaral et al. and Guimer\u00e0 et al. comprehensively investigated the worldwide airport network (WAN) [35, 36] . They found that WAN is a typical scale-free small-world network and the most connected nodes in WAN are not necessarily the most central nodes, which means critical locations might not coincide with highly-connected hubs in the infrastructures. This interesting phenomenon inspired them to propose a geographical-political-constrained network model. Barrat networks and found correlations between weighted quantities and topology [37, 38] . They proposed a weighted evolving network model to expand our understanding of the weighted features of real systems. Furthermore, they proposed a global epidemic model to study the role of WAN in the prediction and predictability of global epidemics. Also, several empirical works on the Chinese Airport Network [39] [40] [41] and the Indian Airport Network [42] reveal that the scale of national airport networks can exhibit different properties from the global scale of WAN, i.e., the two-regime power-law degree distribution and the disassortative mixing property. As the aviation industry is an important indicator of economic growth, it is necessary and very meaningful to investigate the evolution of the airport network. Recently, Gautreau et al. studied the US airport network in the time period 1990-2000. They found that most statistical indicators are stationary and that intense activity takes place at the microscopic level, with many disappearing/appearing links between airports [43] . Rocha studied the Brazilian airport network (BAN) in the time period 1995-2006. He also found the network structure is dynamic, with changes in the importance of airports and airlines, and the traffic on BAN has doubled during a period in which the topology of BAN has shrunk [44] . Inspired by their interesting work, we investigate the evolution of Chinese Airport Network (CAN) from the year 1950 to 2008 (1991-2008 for detailed traffic information and 2002-2009 for detailed topology information). It is found that the airway traffic volume increased in an exponential form while the topology had no significant change.",

Fig. 3(a) shows the degree distribution P(k) of CAN, which follows a two-regime power-law distribution with two different exponents as in Refs. [39] [40] [41] (i.e., for small degrees, P(k) \u221d k \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 1 = \u22120.49; and for large degrees, P(k) \u221d k \u03bb 2 and \u03bb 2 = \u22122.63). We also investigated the directed CAN and it is found that P(k in ) and P(k out ) are almost the same as P(k), where k in is the ingoing degree and k out is the outgoing degree. Fig. 1(b) shows the correlation between k in and k out . One can see that the in-out degree correlation is very strong: the slope is 1.000421. This means that one can fly from one airport to another and return using the same airline. Another important topological property is the degree-degree correlation. It is defined as the mean degree of the neighbors (k nn , which is closely related to the network modularity [46] ) of a given airport. Fig. 3(c) shows the results of degree-degree correlation of undirected CAN and we can find that the degrees of adjacent airports have significant linear anti-correlation. Fig. 3(d) exhibits the relationship of clustering coefficient C and degree k. As it shows, lower degree nodes have larger clustering coefficient. All the results above are well in accordance with the results reported by Li and Cai [39] , Liu and Zhou [40] and Liu et al. [41] .",

However, due to the long distance from western China to eastern China (over 3000 km), it is costly and unnecessary to make all western airports directly link to the eastern airports. Thus some transit airports are naturally formed as the bridge between east and west China. Now we study the evolution of the topological properties of CAN. It can be seen from Table 1 that the topological properties of CAN do not significantly change from 2002 to 2009. Similarly, the topological properties of the Brazilian airport network did not significantly change during a long period of time [44] . Next we make a comparison between the two networks. Fig. 5 (a) compares average shortest path length d of CAN and BAN. One can see that d of CAN is around 2.25 and is slightly smaller than that of BAN. Fig. 5(b) shows the diameter D, which is also slightly smaller in CAN. This means that CAN is more convenient for passengers. Table 2 gives detailed results of shortest paths of CAN in the first half year of 2009. About 10% paths are direct connections and over 98% paths consist of no more than 2 flights. Fig. 5(c) shows that average clustering coefficient C of CAN is apparently larger than that of BAN and Fig. 5(d) shows that CAN is more reciprocal than BAN.",

Although the topology characteristics of CAN is quite steady from year 2002 to 2009, a dynamic switching process underlies the evolution of CAN. Fig. 6 shows the measured fluctuation of CAN from year 2002 to 2009. Fig. 6(a) shows the fluctuation of airports and we can see that the fluctuation (including the added airports and removed airports) is usually between 5 and 15. But for the second half year of 2007 and the first half year of 2008, the fluctuation is evidently more vigorous. Fig. 6(b) shows that the percentage of changed airlines is usually smaller than 20% and the majority of changes is mainly induced by aOO and dOO. But for the second half year of 2007 and the first year of 2008, when many airports were added and removed, aON and dOR contribute the majority of changes.",

As shown in Fig. 7 , the traffic (including cargoes and passengers) has evident seasonal fluctuations as in the United States. If the seasonal fluctuations are averaged out, one finds that the traffic of CAN increases exponentially. We can also observe similar growth (Fig. 8) Fig. 9 displays the cumulative distribution of node strength s, namely the throughput of each airport including passengers (s passenger , see Fig. 9 (a)) and cargoes (s cargo , see Fig. 9(b) ). The distributions are quite broad: 5 orders of magnitude for passengers and 7 for cargoes. The correlations of k and s are also presented. Fig. 9 (c) shows the dependence of s passenger on k, and Fig. 9(d) denoting a strong correlation between strength and topology: s passenger \u221d k 1.58 and s cargo \u221d k 2.20 . We also examined the data from year 2002 to 2007 and the results are similar. Fig. 10 shows the correlations of cargo traffic and passenger traffic from year 2001 to 2008. One can find a strong linear correlation between cargo traffic and passenger traffic for both the total traffic of CAN and the traffic of a single airport/city. However, the ratios of cargo traffic and passenger traffic are quite different. As shown in Fig. 10(a) , the slope is 0.045 for the total traffic of CAN. For municipalities Beijing (Fig. 10(b) ) and Shanghai (Fig. 10(c) Chengdu ( Fig. 10(d) ) and Kunming (Fig. 10(e) ), the slopes are obviously larger, indicating that the passenger traffic is more active in these two cities.",

We also found that there exists a dynamic switching process inside the network, i.e., from the year 2002 to 2009, although the main topological indicators of CAN were quite stationary, there were airports and airlines added and/or removed.",

We also found that the outbreak of global epidemic diseases can greatly affect passenger traffic.

The top 3 Chinese airline companies have reported their operating information for 2008 and the most important indicators are declining. This has been demonstrated by the annual report of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and we can find in Fig. 2 that the traffic for 2008 is almost the same as that of 2007. 3.
