As a result, the developed world became rather complacent, naively welcoming the false dawn of a life mostly free of infectious disease. Since the 1980s things have looked much less secure, however, with the emergence of many previously unrecognized infectious diseases, and the re-emergence of known infectious diseases that were thought to be under control. This trend has continued until the present time and many infectious pathogens, predominantly viruses, have been newly identified in recent years [1 ] . In this review, we describe recent advances in our understanding of several selected viruses of particular concern, and discuss underlying factors for their emergence.",

Specifically, recent advances in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology and nucleotide sequencing sped up this process. After following a few false leads, a hitherto unknown coronavirus was identified as the possible cause of SARS [4 ,5,6]. Within a few weeks, the full genome sequence of this SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was published [7 ,8 ] . On the basis of phylogenetic analyses, SARS-CoV was found neither to be a member of the three recognized coronavirus groups, nor the result of a recombination between known coronaviruses. Therefore, it was placed in a new coronavirus group -group 4 [7 ]. Replication of the pulmonary lesions of SARS in experimentally infected macaques, together with the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection in the majority of 436 SARS patients examined in detail, provided the final proof that SARS-CoV was the primary cause of SARS [9 ,10 ].",

Hypotheses include an overexuberant host response resulting in generalized hypercytokinemia [11 ] and pulmonary fibrosis owing to virus-induced damage at an early stage of the disease [10 ].

This was first shown in Hong Kong in 1997, when six deaths out of 18 human cases resulted from the direct transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1) from chickens to humans. By slaughtering 1.5 million chickens and other poultry in Hong Kong, the source of viral infection for humans was removed. Direct chicken-to-human transmission happened again in 1999, when avian influenza A virus (H9N2) was isolated for the first time in two children hospitalized with upper respiratory tract illness. The unusual ability of this H9N2 virus to replicate efficiently in both chickens and humans can be explained by its preferential binding to sialyl(a2,6)galactose-terminated receptors on host cells. This type of receptor is found on both human and chicken cells, but not on duck cells [14] .",

Infections with this virus were confirmed in 83 people handling poultry, and in three cases there was subsequent transmission between humans. Although most infected people suffered only a conjunctivitis or mild influenza-like illness, one person died of pneumonia [15] . A major concern during the outbreak was that the avian H7N7 virus would reassort with the human H3N2 virus that was circulating in the human population at the same time, with the potential to spark off a new influenza pandemic. Fortunately, this did not occur (R Fouchier, unpublished data).",

On the basis of recent studies in Southern China, H9N2 influenza virus lineages -that originated from domestic ducks and became established in chicken and quail in the mid-1990s -have been transmitted back to domestic ducks. In the process, reassortant viruses have been generated containing nucleic acid segments from both H9N2 viruses and influenza viruses resident in ducks. This suggests that the gene pool of influenza A viruses includes various species of aquatic and terrestrial birds, with easy transmission among species. The diversity of virus genotypes and host receptor specificities results in a continuous flux, conceivably with an increased opportunity for a new pandemic influenza virus to develop [16 ] .",

One of the reasons that it was not found previously is that the virus does not replicate well in the cell lines used for the virological diagnosis of respiratory tract infections in humans up to that time. Although most children are infected by five years of age and the virus has been circulating in the human population since at least 1958, hMPV was only identified in 2001 [17 ] . It is a paramyxovirus most closely related to avian pneumovirus, and is associated with a substantial proportion of hitherto unexplained respiratory tract illnesses [17 ,18 ]. Since its discovery in the Netherlands, hMPV infection has been reported elsewhere in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia [19] . Respiratory tract disease associated with hMPV infection occurs both in children and adults, suggesting that hMPV is capable of causing clinically important reinfection of individuals later in life. The spectrum of clinical disease includes rhinitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and resembles that of human respiratory syncytial virus infection. Severity of the disease varies from the common cold to death, with very young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients being predisposed to severe lower respiratory tract disease [17 ,19,20 ,21] .",

It is occasionally transmitted to humans, horses and other mammals in which disease may occur. The virus attracted major attention when it spread from its original range (Africa, the Middle East and Europe) to North America, where it first appeared in New York in 1999 [22, 23 ] . By phylogenetic analysis, the 1999 New York isolate most closely resembles that of a WNV isolate from Israel in 1997, suggesting that it originated from the Middle East, but how this occurred is not known [24] . The virus has spread rapidly since its arrival in North America, and by August 2003 had reached as far west as Alberta in Canada [25] and California in the USA [26] and as far south as Mexico [27, 28] and the Caribbean [29] . It is likely to spread further south into Central and South America. Modeling shows that this pattern of spread is most likely due to long-distance transport of WNV in infected birds along their migratory flyways, combined with local dissemination by mosquitoes [30] . The mortality of infected birds in North America is unexpectedly high, particularly in corvids, and contrasts with the low pathogenicity of WNV for birds in its original range [31 ] . Passive surveillance of wild bird mortality has proved to be the most effective method to monitor the spread of WNV in North America, and has resulted in a unique integration of public health and wildlife health agencies [31 ] . In addition to mosquito bites, novel routes of transmission to humans include blood transfusion, organ transplantation, feeding of breast milk and through the placenta. As expected in a previously unexposed human population, a relatively high proportion of people infected with WNV in North America develop neurological disease, which is occasionally fatal [22] . ",

Its danger to humans is compounded by limited knowledge of its pathogenesis, an unknown natural reservoir, and limited preventive and therapeutic measures. In addition, Ebola virus infection threatens the survival of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in their last stronghold in western equatorial Africa, where declines in population of more than 50% between 1983 and 2000 are partly blamed on Ebola outbreaks [35 ] . To manage Ebola virus infection, it is important to discover its natural reservoir. Fruit bats are likely candidates, because they are the only experimentally infected species showing long-term excretion in absence of the clinical disease. However, attempts to diagnose Ebola virus infection in free-living fruit bats have been unsuccessful so far [36] .",

Advances in molecular biology will play a large part in facilitating and accelerating these efforts. These include sophistication of PCR-based tests and the use of reverse genetics. The development of robotic PCR machines allows highthroughput screening of samples for surveillance purposes, while real-time PCR assays permit a more rapid diagnosis. Vaccine development will be accelerated by the use of reverse genetics, which is becoming more efficient, more widely available, and applicable to more viruses. This technology allows the production of recombinant virus by transfection of susceptible cell cultures with plasmids encoding the viral genome or complementary copies thereof. Reverse genetics can be used to construct either recombinant vector-based vaccines or live attenuated virus vaccines.",

Likewise, the repeated emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza in humans in Hong Kong could be related to the rapid growth of the poultry industry in China -160% for chickens and 190% for ducks -between 1991 and 2001 [40] . The recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the Netherlands might also be associated with the rapid increase in the number of free-range chickens, from 0 in 1991 to 305 000 in 2001 (data from Statistics Netherlands [41] ); there is an association between the presence of free-range poultry farms and highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in North America and the UK [42] . Furthermore, outbreaks of Ebola virus infection in humans and great apes in western equatorial Africa could have resulted from the rapid expansion of mechanized logging and bushmeat trade in that area [35 ] .",

Despite this uncertainty, we do have the current technological capability to rapidly respond to EIDs in terms of identification and diagnostic techniques and, to a lesser degree, with vaccines and therapeutic agents.

In this well-documented book, McMichael charts the patterns of human health and disease from prehistory to current times. He shows how there are three historical transitions in the coevolution of humans and infectious agents: the first between humans, animals, and pest species; the second between regional human populations; and the third between transoceanic populations. He suggests that we are currently living in a fourth major transition, caused by ecosystem disruption from the combined weight of human population size and intensive consumption.

Knowledge of the etiology allowed the scientific community to focus its attention on this virus for the development of diagnostic tests, vaccine production and antiviral therapy. In this unique prospective study of 75 SARS patients, the SARS-CoV load from the respiratory tract peaked at 10 days after onset of symptoms, while pulmonary disease worsened in the second week after onset.

These results strengthen the conclusion of Fouchier et al. [9 ]. Furthermore, the demonstrated tropism of SARS-CoV for alveolar epithelial cells may explain the pulmonary fibrosis observed later in the disease. 11.
