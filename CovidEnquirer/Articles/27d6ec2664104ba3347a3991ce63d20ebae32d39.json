Spherical virus particles were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Full-length genome sequence of the virus isolate was obtained and phylogenetic analyses showed that it clustered with clade B of MERS-CoV.",

The transmission of MERS-CoV continued until early July, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths. One of the most important characteristics of the Korean outbreak was 4 large clusters of cases due to superspreading event at hospitals, accounting for > 80% of the total cases. Another characteristic was that many cases of second-and third-generation of transmission occurred (5, 6) . This finding is quite contrast to the previous studies suggesting limited person-to-person transmissibility of MERS-CoV (7, 8) . To better understand transmissibility and assess epidemic risk, characterization of MERS-CoV of the Korean outbreak would be of paramount importance (9) . Here, we report the MERS-CoV isolated from a patient of the Korean outbreak.",

The samples were stored at -70\u00b0C until assays. We inoculated m onolayers of Vero cells with the samples and cultured the cells at 37\u00b0C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. Cytopathic effects consisting of rounding and detachment of cells were observed 3 days after the inoculation of the sample taken on day 11 of his illness ( Fig. 1A and B) . The RNA titer in the sample was 5.80 \u00d7 10 7 copies/mL for upE gene and 4.97 \u00d7 10 7 copies/mL for ORF1a gene. In order to observe virus particles, Vero cell monolayer showing the cytopathic effects was fixed as previously described (11) . It was cut on ultramicrotome (RMC MT-XL) at 65 nm. Ultrathin sections were stained with saturated 4% uranyl acetate and 4% lead citrate before examination with a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1400; JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA, USA) at 60 kV. Spherical particles ranging 77 to 131 nm in diameter were observed within the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1C and D) .",

The RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using Su-perScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, MA, USA) by each specific RT primer as described previously (12) . Finally, about 2.5 kb PCR products were amplified by each primer pair (Table 1) , and the amplicons were sheared by Covaris S2 according to the 200 bp target BP condition (Covaris, MA, USA). To generate the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) library, the fragments were ligated with adapter and index (barcode) using TruSeq Nano DNA HT Library Prep kit (Illumina, CA, USA), and the library was sequenced by MiSeq (Illumina, CA, USA). The NGS data were aligned to MERS-CoV, NC_019843, used for Binary Sequence Alignment/Map (BAM) file generation, and genome assembly. In order to evaluate genetic relationship between this isolate and Homo sapiens and Camelus dromedaries MERS-CoV sequences reported from other countries, phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the whole genome, the S gene and the OFR1a gene.",

A previous study about S gene of MERS-CoV reported from Korea showed that a culture isolate from patient number 002 contained two nonsynonymous variants (S137R and V530L) (14) . These variants were not found in our isolate and there was no difference in amino acids of S protein between our isolate and directly sequenced ones (KT374054-5). This difference can be explained by cell culture-adaptation in that our culture isolate was obtained before passage whereas one with nonsysnonymous variant was from the third passage in Vero cells.",
