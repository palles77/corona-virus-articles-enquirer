Dystocia is also present if the bitch or queen has gone> 70-72 days since the first breeding, > 68-70 days since the last breeding, or> 58 days of diestrus. Dystocia occurs commonly in brachycephalic breeds of dogs and miniature and small breeds of dogs, although it can occur in any breed of dog and in cats. Physical exam-Open cervix, fetuses palpable, possibly a complicating factor such as a previous pelvic fracture, inadequate or absence of contractions. Mammary enlargement with milk present and lochia are observed. Lochia, or uteroverdin, is a green vulvar discharge which indicates placental separation has occurred. Delivery of a fetus should normally occur within 2 h of the appearance of lochia. Laboratory evaluation-1. Assessment of the patient's serum calcium level may reveal hypocalcemia. 2. Assessment of the patient's blood glucose level may reveal hypoglycemia. 3. If the patient is systemically ill, a CBC and complete serum biochemical profile and urinalysis should be evaluated. Abdominal radiographs-These are valuable in determining the number of fetuses present, their positioning, their size in relation to the pelvic canal, the presence of an obstruction in the birth canal, and possibly, the presence of fetal death. Signs of fetal death which may be apparent radiographically include intrafetal gas patterns, collapse of a fetal spinal column, overlapping or misalignment of fetal skull bones, or fetal positioning which is abnormal. Abdominal ultrasonography-This may be valuable in assessing fetal age, size, number, position, and viability.",

It usually occurs when the bitch is in, or has just been through, proestrus or estrus. The patient is usually presented when the owner notices tissue protruding from the vulva. The bitch may be observed licking at the tissue or refuse to allow intromission. Vaginal prolapse may occur following forced separation during mating. Uterine prolapse is a rare complication of delivery.The cervix or one or both uterine horns may be involved. The owner may observe straining, licking, vaginal discharge, or a mass protruding from the vulva. Physical exam-Vaginal prolapse appears clinically as either swelling in the perineum or a mass projecting from the vulva. The tissue is usually soft, large, smooth, glistening, pale pink to opalescent in color, rounded and reducible. Usuallythe prolapse originates from the ventral floor of the vaginal vault cranial to the urethral orifice. If the vaginal prolapse is severe it may resemble a doughnut and may include the entire circumference of the vaginal wall. The prolapse may be partial or complete. In complete vaginal prolapse, the cervix projects through the vulvar labia. The appearance of a mass protruding from the vulva in a bitch or queen that has delivered within the last 48 h is diagnostic for uterine prolapse.",

Inform the client of the diagnosis, prognosis, and cost of the treatment. 2. Evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status and treat for shock if necessary. 3. Gently rinse the penis with saline or tap water. 4. Applya hyperosmotic agent, such as 50%dextrose, topically to the extruded and engorged portion of the penis to decrease swelling and edema. 5. Application of a cold pack to the extruded and engorged portion of the penis may also aid in decreasing swelling and edema. 6. Administer sedation or general anesthesia. J. Clean the exposed portion of the penis. Remove all hair and foreign debris. 8. Debride necrotic tissue if necessary. 9. Heavilylubricate the exposed portion of the penis and attempt manual replacement. 10. In some cases, a preputial incision may be required. 11. If the penis is severely traumatized and urethral involvement is suspected, place an indwelling soft rubber urethral catheter for 7-14 days. 12. Place a purse-string suture in the tip ofthe prepuce to hold the penis within for 1-24 h.",

In dogs with nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis, the owner may observe hematuria, sublumbar or abdominal discomfort, depression, anorexia, and vomiting. The owner may observe dysuria, stranguria, pollakiuria, cloudy urine, or notice a foul odor to the urine in dogs with cystourolithiasis or urethral urolithiasis. Physical exam-Perform a thorough physical exam. Assess the mental state. Evaluate the hydration status and cardiovascular status. Auscult the heart for arrhythmias. Palpate femoral pulses for strength and character. Carefully palpate the abdomen. Evaluate the renal size. and shape. Monitor for a pain response during renal palpation. Evaluate the size of the urinary bladder (unless the bladder has ruptured), thickened urinary bladder wall or the presence of cystouroliths. Examine the penis and preputial area. Perform a rectal examination in all dogs and palpate the extrapelvic urethra in male dogs. During an attempt to pass a urethral catheter, the feeling of passing through grit or sand or an obstruction maybe met. Characteristics ofcanine uroliths (see Figure 9 .2)-1. Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) uroliths 8.

Dogs:\u2022 Feed a diet containing a minimum of9-16% protein, depending upon the severity of clinical signs. \u2022 Dogs with renal disease should be fed a diet of 0.13-0.28% phosphorus, on a dry-matter basis. \u2022 Recommended diets include Hill's prescription diet canine k/d\u00ae, Purina NF-formula diets and Waltham Veterinarian medium-and low-protein diets. II. Cats:\u2022 Feed a diet containing a minimum of 21% protein.\u2022 Cats with renal disease should be fed a diet of < 1.0 mg/kcal of phosphorus, on a dry-matter basis. \u2022 Recommended diets include Hill's prescription diet feline k/d\u00ae. e. Feed at least three meals daily. 13. Gradually change to low-sodium diets to allow for renal compensation (over a minimum of2 weeks). 14. The administration of calcitriol (l,25-dihydroxyvitamin D), 1.5-3.5 ng/kg/day PO, combined with phosphorus restriction and oral phosphate binders may help to lower serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), with the following reported effects 8. Decreased central nervous system depression, allowing the patient to appear brighter, more alert, and more interactive with the owner. b. Improved appetite. c. Increased physical activity. d. Lengthening of life span.\u2022 Decreased susceptibility to infection.\u2022 Slowed progression of renal failure. 15. Consider supplementation with Vitamins Band C and add zinc, 1 mg/kg/day if feeding a homemade diet. 16. Consider the administration of anabolic steroids. They promote protein anabolism and may help to correct anemia. (The patient must be receiving adequate nutrition or these products can become catabolic) 8. Testosterone propionate, 10-15 mg/dog/day. b. Nandrolene decanoate (Deca-Durabolinv) \u2022 Dogs: 1-5 mg/kg 1M,SC q7-1O days (maximum dose of 40 mg in dogs).\u2022 Cats: 2-4 mg/kg 1M,SC q7-10 days (maximum dose of20 mgin cats). c. Testosterone enanthate, 50-150 mg/dog 1Mql-4 wks. d. Stanozol (Winstrol-V\u00ae)\u2022 1-4 mg PO q 12-24h or 25-50 mg 1Mweekly in dogs.\u2022 0.5-2 mg PO q12h or 10-25 mg 1Mweekly in cats. e. Oxymethalone (Anadrols), 1 mg/kg PO qI2-24h. 11. Human recombinant erythropoietin (Epogene) can be used in the treatment of non-regenerative anemia in dogs and cats secondary to chronic renal disease 8. The dose is 50-100 ug/kg SC two to three times per week until the patient's PCV~30% in cats and~35% in dogs, then decrease administration to once every 4-5 days. b. The hematocrit must be monitored as polycythemia may be induced. ",
