Epithelial cells could be a significant source of neutrophil chemoattractants, which contributes to a low-grade inflammation in older subjects. Persistent, low-grade inflammation could damage elastin and perhaps lead to the age-associated loss of elastin fibers. Therefore, considering that many patients affected by asthma or COPD who increasingly perform induced sputum are often \u03fe 50 years old, these findings deserve further investigations. ",

The ribavirin-treated patients had higher lactate dehydrogenase levels, a well-known adverse prognostic factor in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The nonsignificantly higher mortality could be due to the more severe disease in this group. Viral load, another important predictor of mortality, was not available. 2 Moreover, Figure 1 seemed inaccurate: the survival in ribavirin-treated patients should be 0.88 at day 30 (5 of 44 patients died) instead of 0.71.",

The survival curves in Figure 4 also appeared inaccurate: the survival in patients with drop in hemoglobin \u03fe 2 g/dL should be 0.69 (5 of 16 patients died) instead of 0.45.
