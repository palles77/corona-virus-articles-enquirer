Rapid emergence of drug resistance has led to an urgent need to develop new anti-influenza inhibitors. In this study we established a 293T cell line that constitutively synthesizes a virus-based negative strand RNA, which expresses Gaussia luciferase upon influenza A virus infection. Using this cell line, an assay was developed and optimized to search for inhibitors of influenza virus replication. Biochemical studies and statistical analyses presented herein demonstrate the sensitivity and reproducibility of the assay in a high-throughput format (Z 0 factor value40.8). A pilot screening provides further evidence for validation of the assay. Taken together, this work provides a simple, convenient, and reliable HTS assay to identify compounds with anti-influenza activity.",

            "text": "The use of high-throughput screening (HTS) technology for antiviral discovery is a fairly recent endeavor. Utilizing virusinducible reporter genes to quantitate the infectivity has been achieved for several viruses 5,6 . A reporter system mimicking the process of transcription/replication of influenza virus was constructed by Lutz et al. 7 . Cells were transfected with a reporter system that expressed Firefly luciferase in a response proportional to the infectivity of influenza virus. This luciferase assay is more rapid and simple than the standard plaque assays. Afterward de Vries et al. 8 adapted this system by substituting Gaussia luciferase. Gaussia luciferase (hereafter referred to as Gluc), discovered from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps, can give high levels of light emission centered at 470 nm by catalyzing the oxidation of the substrate coelenterazine to coelenteramide 9 . This reaction requires no cofactors but O 2, and it generates over 100-fold higher bioluminescent signal intensity when compared with other frequently used luciferase reactions (e.g., Renilla or Firefly luciferase) 10, 11 . With the help of a secretory signal, Gluc was secreted into the culture medium. Lysis of the cells was not necessary, and the measurement of luciferase activity was simple and time-saving, making Gluc assays a promising technique. Nevertheless, transient transfection of the Gluc reporter system is likely to introduce variation between the experiments.",

As a stable cell line, 293T-Gluc cells that contain pLenti6-Gluc synthesize a viral negative strand RNA constitutively, which expresses Gluc under control of the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the influenza A/WSN/33 NP segment (Fig. 1) . We assessed the response of this reporter cell line to different strains of influenza virus. As shown in Fig. 2 , the infection with influenza A viruses induced much higher luciferase activity than did the two strains of influenza B virus. The observation that the 293T-Gluc cell line is more responsive to influenza A virus may reflect species specificity of UTR region for the corresponding RdRp, which is consistent with a previous observation 7 . Among all the virus strains tested, the A/WSN/33 strain exhibited the most potent ability to induce luciferase activity when the cells were infected at identical MOI. Therefore, influenza A/WSN/33 virus was used for all subsequent experiments.",

When infected with virus at MOIs of 0.001 or lower, cells failed to generate a detectable Gluc signal. It should be noted that viral infection at an MOI of 1 induced significant CPE in 293T-Gluc cells like MDCK, while the cells kept a normal morphology during the 96 h time period of post-infection when the MOI was less than 0.1 (data not shown). This may explain the observation that the Gluc signal from the cells infected at an MOI of 1 was less than that of MOI of 0.1 (Fig. 3) , most likely due to reduced cell viability. ",

Ribavirin is used against several DNA and RNA viruses including influenza viruses 15, 16 . It is converted to ribavirin monophosphate, which disturbs GTP synthesis, leading to inhibition of RNA synthesis in cells 17 . Amantadine hydrochloride, approved for the treatment of influenza infections, acts in the early phase of the life cycle of influenza A virus to target the M2 ion channel 18, 19 . Nucleozin is a novel inhibitor with antiinfluenza activity. It impedes influenza A virus replication by triggering the aggregation of NP and inhibits its nuclear accumulation 20 . We used the Gluc reporter assay to evaluate these antivirals in dose-response experiments, measuring IC 50 (Fig. 4) . All the compounds showed the ability to reduce the luciferase signal driven by influenza A/WSN/33 virus. IC 50 values determined from our experiments were comparable to data previously reported (Table 1) , demonstrating the applicability of the Gluc reporter assay for screening influenza inhibitors. Furthermore, compared with the conventional plaque reduction assay (PRA) 24 , the method herein is more rapid and simple for the determination of IC 50 values. At least 48 h were needed before the number of plaques could be calculated, whereas our assay can give results in 24 h after infection. Moreover, this unbiased and automated method of infectivity quantitation avoids tedious plaque counting, making it an ideal approach.",

To ensure that the assay can be used in high-throughput screening, we assessed its accuracy by using several statistical parameters 25 ( Table 2) . Z 0 factor is a simple statistical characteristic for HTS assay. It can be used to evaluate the performance of an assay. A robust assay should have a Z 0 factor40.5 and the larger the value of Z 0 factor, the better the data quality of the assay 26 . The Z 0 factor in our experiments was 0.84 (n \u00bc48), which is considered to be excellent for use in HTS (Fig. 5) . Normally, infected cells treated with a positive anti-influenza compound are used as positive control for calculating the Z 0 factor. Nevertheless, according to the assay validation guidance for agonist assays (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/books/NBK83783/), the background signal is also suitable for use as a 'minimum signal'. Since viral infection acts as an agonist of luminescent protein, we used mock-infected cells as positive control in the validation analysis. Similarly, other work used mock-infected cells as positive control to calculate the Z 0 factor 27 . In addition, as shown in Fig. 4 , most of the anti-influenza compounds tested were able to achieve full inhibition in our assay. Moreover, the minimum signals derived from infected cells treated with one of the positive anti-influenza compounds were close to that of mock-infected cells. CV is another parameter used for quality assessment. It reflects signal deviation within an assay and is recommended to be less than or equal to 20% (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK83783/). The CV of our assay was 5.79%, which meets the requirements for HTS. In addition, the S/B ratio (23.24) and the S/N ratio (16.29) were comparable to those of other HTS assays reported 28, 29 , proving our assay was suitable for use in a high-throughput screen.",

The Gaussia luciferase open reading frame was inserted in the reverse orientation and complementary sense between the influenza virus untranslated regions (UTRs) which serve as the viral promoter. This cassette is flanked by a human RNA polymerase I (Pol I) promoter and terminator. The transcribed RNA is a vRNA-like negative sense RNA, which mimics an influenza virus genome segment. Upon infection, the influenza virus polymerase recognizes the UTRs and Gaussia luciferase is transcribed and expressed. A eukaryotic selection marker of Blasticidin was used to establish stable cell line 293T-Gluc.",
