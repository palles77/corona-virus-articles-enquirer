            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) and is widely considered to be one of the most significant infectious diseases to affect the feline population. [1] [2] [3] It is the most common infectious disease of the central nervous system (CNS) of cats. 4 FCoVs have been reported to exist as two distinct serotypes: type I (more common) and type II viruses, 5 each with distinct biological properties. 5, 6 Both FCoV serotypes have distinct 'biotypes'. These are typically classified as either feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) or feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), with the biotypes differing based on the severity of infection in cats. [7] [8] [9] Infection with FCoV is common, especially in highdensity housing situations such as animal shelters and breeding facilities. 10 The FECV biotype transmits readily and causes only a mild infection, with transmission occurring via fecal-oral and possibly other routes. 7, 11 If the viral infection worsens and becomes systemic (typically infecting macrophages), then the virus is classified as the FIPV biotype. 8 Such viruses are believed to contain an 'internal mutation' that accounts for the altered tropism, although the nature of this mutation is not well understood. 12 Clinical signs associated with the FIPV biotype can be quite variable and non-specific, and can include fever, lethargy, anorexia, pica, vomiting and diarrhea. 13 These clinical signs can be present in either the 'wet', 'dry' or 'mixed' presentations. 14 The wet form of FIP is characterized by an effusion in the abdominal and/or thoracic or pericardial cavities, and the 'dry' form by the presence of pyogranulomatous lesions. The 'mixed' form may present with an array of clinical signs. Most commonly, neurologic clinical signs are associated with the 'dry' form but can occur with all presentations and may be the sole clinical sign observed. 12, 13 Clinical features of neurologic FIP can include, but are not limited to, ataxia, head tremors, seizures and/or paresis. 12, 13, 15 Ocular lesions may be present with or without lesions in the CNS. FIP-associated pathologic changes to the CNS include meningitis, encephalitis, ependymitis and choroid plexitis, often with concurrent vasculitis. 12,13 FIP presenting with predominantly neurologic clinical signs provides a diagnostic challenge and definitive ante-mortem diagnosis is difficult. MRI has been identified as a sensitive method of diagnosis in conjunction with clinical signs and cerebrospinal fluid analysis results such as elevated protein levels and neutrophilic pleocytosis. 16 However, such findings are still not specific to FIP and may be financially prohibitive. FIP may also be considered a diagnosis of exclusion, following evaluation of clinical signs, history and physical examination findings and biochemical values. 12, 13 This case report describes a cat with neurologic FIP that progressed over several months. The observations and findings obtained in this case provide support that FIP can present predominantly in the CNS. When molecular techniques are applied to the virus, a propensity for certain mutations can be associated with specific clinical presentations or pathological changes.",

In the spinal cord, the leptomeninges were diffusely expanded by moderate numbers of predominantly plasma cells, admixed with fewer lymphocytes and macrophages, and surrounded by a moderate amount of edema. The underlying white matter was multifocally vacuolated with numerous dilated myelin sheaths, digestion chambers and rare spheroids (Figure 1a) . At the level of the lateral aperture, the choroid plexus was expanded by large numbers of plasma cells, lymphocytes and macrophages (Figure 1b) . The ependyma lining the ventricular system was effaced by a similar inflammatory population, admixed with fibrin, edema and was also forming thick perivascular cuffs often disrupting the sub-ependymal parenchyma (Figure 1c) . Immunohistochemistry revealed strong intracytoplasmic immunoreactivity within macrophages (Figure 1d ). No FIPassociated lesions were present in other organs. Non-FCoV comorbid histologic findings were chronic enteritis with mid-mucosal fibrosis and mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia. Molecular analysis of the viral spike protein was performed at several time points during the study. Fecal samples were collected at 5 months of age (feces #1) and at 8 months of age (feces #2). Following euthanasia (at 10 months of age) tissue samples were collected, along with a fecal sample (feces #3). A central 156 base pair region of the spike protein gene, including the critical S1/S2 activation site of the virus, was PCR amplified and sequenced as described in Licitra et al, 17 with the following modifications: 25 \u03bcl reverse transcription PCRs were performed with qScript XLT 1-Step RT PCR kit (Quantbio). PCR conditions were 20 mins at 50\u00b0C, 3 mins at 95\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 10 s at 95\u00b0C, 20 s at 55\u00b0C, 40 s at 72\u00b0C, then 10 mins at 72\u00b0C.

The sequence information obtained from this cat is shown in Figure 2 . The viral sequences from the CNS (brain and spinal cord) contained specific amino acid changes compared with other samples (feces, small intestine, mesenteric lymph node and kidney). The most notable change was an arginine to methionine (R-M) substitution at the critical P1 activation position, 17 corresponding to residue 793. Other changes that correlated with viruses present in the CNS were present in two other positions: 770 alanine to valine (A-V); and 786 threonine to alanine (T-A).",

            "text": "Here we report clinicopathologic findings and molecular analysis of a cat with progressive neurologic clinical signs associated with FIP. The cat initially presented to the referring veterinarian with respiratory signs and fever, and with abnormal liver enzyme function and anemia. At this time FIP was not suspected. These initial signs resolved but were replaced by progressing neurologic signs, which led ultimately to euthanasia and submission to the study for evaluation of FCoV involvement. Upon euthanasia, FCoV was found in various tissues in the cat, including the CNS. However, histologic examination revealed FCoV-associated pathology only within the CNS, where there was meningoencephalomyelitis, ependymitis, choroid plexitis and vasculitis. Histo logical lesions were compatible with a recent report describing meningoencephalitis in four cats with FIP. 18 Molecular analysis of the viral spike protein within the tissues identified a specific, functionally relevant amino acid change (R793M), which was only identified in tissues associated with the CNS (ie, brain and spinal cord). The R793M mutation in the spike protein S1/S2 cleavage-activation site is a major chemical change from a basic to a hydrophobic residue, and is consistent with an elimination of furin-mediated proteolytic processing of the S protein, as seen by Licitra et al, 17 and a proposed change in the activation properties and entry pathway of the virus. It is interesting to note that the R793M mutation was not present in other tissues tested in this cat at the time of necropsy but was found in our previous study (cat ID #08-153990), 17 where samples were of neural origin. While biological confirmation is not available, we consider that the other changes found in the viral spike protein from central nervous tissue of this cat (A770V and T786A) are not related to changes in the activation properties and entry pathway of the virus, as they are not in defined functional regions of the spike protein and are not markedly different in their chemistry. Interestingly, all samples tested from this cat contained a distinct leucine residue at position 791 (the P3 position of the furin cleavage site, typically serine or alanine as defined in Licitra et al). 17 The relevance of this is currently unclear. Overall, our results provide evidence that mutation of the viral spike protein is linked to FIP outcome, specifically in the S1/S2 cleavage-activation site (residues 789-794).",

The choroid plexus is markedly expanded by inflammation, which extends into the surrounding periventricular tissue (\u00d7 20, hematoxylin and eosin). (c) Mesencephalon.
