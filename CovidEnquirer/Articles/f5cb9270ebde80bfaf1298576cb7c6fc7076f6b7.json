The role of hedgehogs as hosts for these pathogens is, therefore, of considerable epidemiologic interest. Hedgehogs are a common synanthropic species that live in urban, suburban, and rural environments (4) and are known to carry not only the hedgehog tick, Ixodes hexagonus, but also the most common European tick, I. ricinus (2, 5) . Both of these ticks are known vectors of B. burgdorferi s. l. and tickborne encephalitis virus; I. ricinus is the most important vector of both throughout Europe (1, 5) . To date, however, only limited information has been available on the role of the hedgehog as a host or reservoir for B. burgdorferi s. l. in Germany.",

The target for the PCR was the spacer region between 5S and 23S rRNA genes of B. burgdorferi s. l. The nested primers generated a product of 226 bp. The amplifi ed products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The second protocol, a LightCycler-PCR hybridization assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) (8), simultaneously detects and genotypes the 3 genomic groups of B. burgdorferi s. l. This assay was specifi c for B. burgdorferi senso stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii (8) but also amplifi ed B. spielmanii and B. valaisiana. The target for the PCR was the OspA gene.",

Two additional animals had positive results, but sequencing was not possible because of either too little DNA or a mixed infection. B. spielmanii DNA was detected in the kidneys of 2 hedgehogs: 1 from Karlsruhe and 1 from 30 km west of this city in the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. When sequences were compared by using BLAST, 4 BLAST sequences (AM055823, AM055822, DQ133518, AY 995900) showed 100% similarity with B. spielmanii. B. garinii was detected in the heart of 2 animals (from Berlin and Karlsruhe); B. afzelii in 3 animals (in the kidney of 2 from Hamburg and Karlsruhe and in the bladder of 1 from Rhineland-Palatinate). A single animal (from Karlsruhe) had B. afzelii in the kidney and bladder and B. garinii in the heart. Preliminary results have also shown that ticks collected from hedgehogs from the Karlsruhe site were infected with B. afzelii (an I. hexagonus nymph and an I. ricinus female) and with B. spielmanii (an I. ricinus female, a nymph, and a larva) (Skuballa et al., unpub. data).",

To our knowledge, ours is the fi rst report of B. spielmanii from hedgehogs, a Borrelia sp. that is usually associated with rodents, especially with garden and hazel dormice (10) . That Borrelia spp. infections commonly occur in European hedgehogs is likely. However, questions remain about the role of these pathogens in regulating the populations of European hedgehogs and about the status of these common synanthropic mammals as a reservoir host of B. burgdorferi s. l. in periurban and rural environments.",

However, a recent meta-analysis of controlled trials has shown evidence of increased risk for serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with TNF-\u03b1 antagonists (1).Adalimumab is a human monoclonal antibody to TNF-\u03b1 approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The Spanish registry of adverse events of biologic therapies in rheumatic diseases reported that 1,080 patients were treated with adalimumab from 2003 through 2006 and no cases of cryptococcosis were recorded (2) . No cases of cryptococcosis have been detected in 10,050 treated patients in the US postmarketing database for adalimumab (3) . We report invasive cryptococcosis in a patient receiving adalimumab. This case underscores the relationship between TNF antagonists and emergence of severe and diffi cult-to-treat opportunistic infections.A 69-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed in 2002 was referred to our hospital for severe acute infl ammation of the second fi nger of the left hand. She had been treated with oral corticosteroids (prednisone, 7.5 mg/day) and several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including chloroquine, methotrexate,",
