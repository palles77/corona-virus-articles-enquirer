            "text": "The catalyst for the APEC report was the October 2002 terrorist bombings in Bali. However, these observations have sadly been proven equally correct by the December 2004 Asian Tsunami disaster, where thousands of foreign nationals were totally reliant on local people at various tourist destinations for their survival. While it might be argued that the Asian Tsunami was different from other shocks experienced by the tourism industry in recent years (for example, terrorist acts, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in that the devastation was so widespread that it encompassed tourists and locals equally, the fact remains that tourists are a particularly vulnerable group who are reliant on others in times of need. This book is about ensuring that visitors to the world's tourist destinations have safe and enjoyable experiences, taking into account the various direct and indirect threats that may impact on the tourism industry. Safety in this context is all about preventing injury or harm to individuals and/or groups (Wilks, 2003a) . While the term 'safety' technically covers the main threats to tourists, it is common in the tourism and travel literature to distinguish between health, safety and security. This distinction mainly reflects the background and orientation of the different disciplines contributing to this area. The convention is loosely adopted here, with Part 1 of the book devoted to Health, while Part 2 presents Safety and Security chapters. However, there is also recognition that effective responses to the challenges facing tourism will only be possible through cross-disciplinary collaboration and partnerships between the industry and governments.",

            "text": "Security, defined as freedom from danger, risk or doubt, was included in the original list, though until recently it has been a largely neglected area of service consideration in tourism (Wilks & Oldenburg, 1995) . In fairness, tourism is about selling dreams and any public focus on visitor illness, injury or mishap is not conducive to selling holidays (Wilks, 2004a) . However, particularly after the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 people wanted to be assured of their safety (Taylor, 2001) . Destinations can now rise or fall on these perceptions (Beirman, 2003) , so the second issue for tourist health, safety and security is that it must be seen as a critical and legitimate element of quality service, both by the tourism industry and by governments (the first issue was recognizing the vulnerability of visitors). Interestingly, within the World Tourism Organization (WTO) (www.worldtourism.org) the tourism safety and security programme has always been part of the quality department (see Chapter 16). One of the difficulties in establishing health, safety and security within tourism is that the roles of the required personnel are very different to that of mainstream tourism staff. A seat on a plane not sold on the day, or a hotel room vacant overnight is a lost opportunity for income that cannot be recovered. The tourism industry therefore tends to be focused on active selling and servicing of its products. The role of protecting these valuable, but somewhat intangible assets, involves planning, staff training and practice exercises, audits, monitoring and evaluation -all tasks that do not necessarily generate income or produce obvious benefits. This is why the Communications or Marketing Manager in many tourism organizations is the default crisis management person -it is an 'add-on' consideration, with assumptions that day-to-day operations will take care of safety and that external agencies like the police will always be available in a crisis. As theory and practice clearly show, quality crisis management does not automatically attach to a job description (Marriott, 2004) , so tourism must accept the need for employed personnel whose primary responsibility is to protect the product. The days of relying solely on insurance for protection are largely over (Liability Insurance Taskforce, 2002) . By analogy, construction sites employ security staff to ensure their building materials are not stolen or the premises vandalized. As a very current issue, tourism needs to adopt the same approach to protecting its assets and reputation.",

The 1998 Think Tank on Safety and Security in Orlando, Florida, for example, identified crime, terrorism and food safety as the three primary concerns by participants (IH&RA, 1998) .

Consular Information Sheets are issued for every country in the world, with information on such matters as the health conditions, crime, unusual currency or entry requirements, any areas of instability, and the location of the nearest US embassy or consulate in the subject country. General information on safety issues for travelling overseas is also provided by the Department under the headings presented in Table  1 .2.

In the past, Public Announcements have been issued to deal with short-term coups, bomb threats to airlines, violence by terrorists and anniversary dates of specific terrorist events.

For example, a recent review of risk management for 21 tourist destinations in Oceania (Wilks, 2005) . That is, no serious safety or security concerns, some petty crime, typhoons and seismic activity, and a range of possible infectious diseases (most notably dengue fever, hepatitis A and typhoid fever). Malaria was specifically noted for the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, while Japanese B encephalitis was mentioned for the Northern Marianas. In late 2000, Micronesia had experienced an outbreak of cholera. The range of infectious diseases prevalent in this region highlighted the need for all travellers to carry appropriate travel health insurance, especially cover for emergency medical evacuation. In many smaller and remote destinations, it was noted that adequate medical care would not be available should a tourist require emergency treatment. The importance of travel insurance, especially for medical evacuations is expanded upon in Chapter 3. So, in terms of current issues, the tourism industry (with a customer focus) and national governments (in the interests of their citizens) share some common concerns about terrorism, crime, food safety, infectious disease and personal injury. However, as we shall see, based on their resources, responsibilities and priorities, the groups respond to tourist health, safety and security issues in very different ways. Another point worth emphasizing is that current issues change, especially at tourist destinations, which is why travel advisories must be kept up-to-date.",

International groups are very important for providing a 'big picture' view of current issues, and as discussed below, frameworks for accommodating the many and varied issues that are not necessarily prioritized by industry groups or all national governments. A good example is child sex tourism, where countries that are party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) (http://www.unicef.org/crc/crc.htm) have undertaken to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, including the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices (Article 34).",

Some very innovative and useful visitor safety programmes are discussed in the Adventure section of this book; however, as Tarlow points out in Chapter 7, tourists behave differently when away from home, often doing things in a state of disorientation or 'anomie'. So the tourism response must go beyond the minimum duty of care responsibilities in many cases, to understand and prevent reasonably foreseeable incidents from occurring in the first place. This is not to suggest that tourists do not have to take personal responsibility for their actions, but rather that the relevant authorities need to assist them in making informed choices. For example, some countries have severe penalties for drug trafficking. This should be drawn to the attention of visitors so that there can be no misunderstanding of the consequences if local laws are disregarded. Many tourists are unaware that the drug laws of the host country are applicable, not those of the tourist's citizenship.",

In the case of tourism, without the support of senior government officials there is little point in continuing the process. This was the point made about government leadership previously. In addition to the national government, the following stakeholder groups should be involved in the risk management process at this early stage: \u2022 Financial institutions \u2022 Insurance organizations \u2022 Tourism businesses and related commercial interests at each destination \u2022 Regulators and other government organizations that have authority over activities (e.g., police, emergency services) \u2022 Non-government organizations such as environmental and public interest groups \u2022 The media, who are potential stakeholders as well as conduits of information to other stakeholders.",

This is where an understanding of the risk, crisis and disaster definitions is important. Traditionally, risk planning and low-level problems are retained by tourism authorities (e.g. educational campaigns for tourists about sun protection). A crisis response is traditionally coordinated by police (e.g. a hotel fire), whereas a disaster (e.g. a major flood) is managed by emergency services, often with assistance from the military. In establishing the risk management context for any tourism destination, the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders must be made clear at the outset. This should be documented as part of national policy, and linked to any wider government disaster management plan. Legislative authority and resources must be in place.",

Tourism has a major responsibility to ensure that policy, plans and partnerships are in place across the tourism sector to support the active role of the police in the event of a crisis situation. One way of achieving these aims is through the formation of a National Tourism Safety and Security Committee (Wilks, 2003b) .",

One is that tourism traditionally does not engage fully with health, law enforcement or emergency service agencies in prevention and planning activities, instead relying on these agencies only when problems arise. The general lack of coordination between tourism and health authorities in many destinations affected by SARS is testimony to this lack of existing collaborative relationships. The second issue is the need to convince governments at the highest level of the importance of protecting tourism. In the APEC report this formed the lead chapter titled 'Protecting Tourism', which documented the economic benefits of tourism to the 21 APEC member states through income, jobs and foreign investment and trade opportunities (Wilks & Moore, 2004) . Only by having genuine commitments at the highest levels of government can the tourism industry cater for the safety of visitors in turbulent times.",

According to the Australian/New Zealand Standard, comprehensive identification using a well-structured systematic process is critical, because a potential risk not identified at this stage is excluded from further analysis. Identification should include all risks, whether or not they are under the control of the tourist destination or national government. Examination of the potential 'indirect' shocks to the tourism industry identified in the Queensland Tourism Crisis Management Plan (Table 1 .3) shows that risks such as currency fluctuations and economic downturns are largely beyond the ability of any one government to control. However, a fairly comprehensive general list of possible risks can be developed based on the WTO framework and the various tourism industry and government sources discussed earlier.",

Countries are rated according to two types of risk -Political and Security -on a five level scale (insignificant, low, medium, high and extreme) with accompanying commentary.

This is why there are so many sources of valuable information about the risks or threats to the tourism industry, but very few best practice models of how governments and industry are working together in a systematic and effective way. While the WTO (1991) recommended that 'every country develop a national policy on tourism safety commensurate with the prevention of tourist risks', most countries still have no operational policies for the health, safety and security of their visitors. This again comes back to not having high-level political support in the first place.

The book draws on the background and expertise of contributors from 11 countries, representing scholars, government officers and industry practitioners. It addresses traditional concerns for tourism (such as crime) as well as emerging challenges posed by the global movement of infectious disease and terrorism. Recognizing that tourists are most likely to experience difficulties due to being in unfamiliar environments and participating in unfamiliar activities, an examination is made of popular adventure tourism pursuits. The chapter topics are examined by specialists who share a view that tourism can weather turbulent times through adopting appropriate risk management strategies and continuing to provide quality service for customers. Chapter 1 has provided an overview of the current issues in tourist health, safety and security, emphasizing that tourists are a vulnerable group that must be assisted through genuine partnerships between the tourism industry and governments. Protection of visitors is an essential part of quality service and in many cases is legally required by statute or a common law duty of care. The tourism industry must accept that employment of appropriately skilled staff is required; risk and crisis management are not 'add-on' duties for personnel with other responsibilities. Key sources of information were then identified for the current issues in tourist health, safety and security -noting that risk identification was actually the second step in a formal risk management approach to visitor protection. The first step was Establishing the Context and in particular gaining the authority, cooperation and resources to complete the task properly.",

Where events external to tourism are the source of threats the industry must establish partnerships with other specialist agencies, and to a large extent rely on the leadership of national governments.
