Objective: To investigate the Prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. Study design: The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or PCR was employed to screen HCoV-HKU1 and other common respiratory viruses in 645 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens collected from children with ARTI from November 2006 to October 2008. All PCR positive products were sequenced. And the demographic and clinical data were collected for all patients. Results: Nineteen of 645 (2.95%) specimens tested positive for HCoV-HKU1, and all HCoV-HKU1 positive specimens were distributed in the winter and spring season. The HCoV-HKU1 co-infection rate with other respiratory viruses was 47.37% (9/19). There was no statistically significant difference in the detection rate between groups by age or gender, except between patients with and without underlying diseases. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating in the years 2007 and 2008 in children with ARTI in Lanzhou, China. Conclusions: HCoV-HKU1 is an uncommon virus existing among Chinese children with ARTI. Children with underlying diseases are more vulnerable to viral infection. Only HCoV-HKU1 genotype B circulated locally.",

The HCoV 229E and OC43 subtypes were initially identified as causes of common colds in the 1960s, and occasionally pneumonia in young children, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised adults. [1] [2] [3] [4] Recently three novel human coronavirus were identified, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), human coronavirus Netherlands (HCoV-NL63), and human coronavirus Hong Kong (HCoV-HKU1). [5] [6] [7] [8] HCoV-HKU1 was first isolated in 2005 from a 71-year-old man with pneumonia. 6 Several successive reports confirmed retrospectively that HCoV-HKU1 was circulating worldwide. [9] [10] [11] [12] However, the impact and the role of the emerging HCoV-HKU1 were not defined in children with ARTI. In China, there is limited epidemiological data about HCoV-HKU1 infection, especially concerning the prevalence and clinical characterization of HCoV-HKU1 in children with ARTI. In the present study, 645 NPA specimens were collected. The presence of HCoV-HKU1 and other common respiratory viruses was screened, and the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 were analyzed.",

Interestingly, a significant difference in the incidence rate (P = 0.042) was observed between HCoV-HKU1patients with and without underlying disease. But no significant difference was observed between the two groups for the number of hospital stay days or clinical symptoms. Additionally, the incidence rate for HCoV-HKU1 infection between outpatients and inpatients was not significantly different (Table 1 ). These results indicated that patients with underlying diseases may be more prone to HCoV-HKU1 infection, but that HCoV-HKU1 infection did not aggravate the clinical symptoms and did not contribute to the hospitalization rate or hospital stay duration. There were three patients with cardiovascular diseases and three with kidney diseases, which ranked first in terms of underlying diseases. Further study is needed to investigate whether cardiovascular and kidney diseases are major risk factors for HCoV-HKU1 infection.",

The phylogenetic analyses showed that the 19 HCoV-HKU1 strains were all classified into the HCoV-HKU1 genotype B lineage. This result indicated that a single cluster of HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating locally. One previous study from Australian also reported genotype B was dominant locally. 9 But In Italian and Hong Kong genotype A, B, and C were all circulating. 18, 21 In conclusion, we showed the prevalence and clinical characteristics of HCoV-HKU1 in a pediatric population with ARTI in China. HCoV-HKU1 was detected in 19 of 645 (2.95%) children. 47.37% of them were coinfected with other respiratory viruses with RSV the most common coinfection virus. The most common symptom and clinical diagnoses with HCoV-HKU1 infection were crackles and acute asthmatic bronchopneumonia. A single HCoV-HKU1 genotype B was circulating locally in the years 2007 and 2008. Our study indicated that patients with underlying disease may be more prone to HCoV-HKU1 infection with no impact on clinical symptoms, hospitalization rate or hospital stay duration.",
