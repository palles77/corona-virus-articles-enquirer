Malaria is transmitted by a number of different species of Anopheles mosquito.

Although there are over 50 different Anopheles mosquitoes in this region, only one has been shown to be an important vector of malaria: Anopheles darlingi. A. darlingi breeds in partly shaded pools. Slash and burn land clearing and road building change the chemical composition of the soil, reduce shading, and often create small pools of water. As a result, deforestation favors breeding of this vector and has been shown to increase malaria exposure in the Amazon. In the Peruvian Amazon, investigators found that biting rates of A. darlingi in deforested areas were 278 times higher than biting rates in forested areas. These findings supported earlier work showing strong associations between deforestation and malaria and epidemiological evidence of malaria surges following periods of deforestation ( Figure 1 ). In Africa, there are four primary malaria vectors: the anopheles species gambiae, funestus, moucheti, and nili. Anopheles nili and A. moucheti have more localized distributions and are considered 'subsidiary' vectors. Of these four, only A. nili is considered a forest species, and it has a relatively limited role in transmission, being restricted to localized forested areas. Given that the primary vectors of malaria in Africa prefer cleared areas, it is not surprising that a number of studies have found associations between deforestation and increased malaria exposure in sub-Saharan Africa. A recent review of deforestation and malaria reinforced the conclusion that deforestation in Africa tends to increase malaria transmission. Essentially, forest clearing increases the habitat and range of the primary malaria vectors and thereby increases human exposure to malaria.",

An elegant series of investigations by Afrane and colleagues has gone beyond counting the density of anopheline vectors in forested versus deforested areas. In experiments performed in the western Kenya highlands, these investigators evaluated how deforestation may affect the life cycle of Anopheles species through microclimatic change. They showed that, by reducing shading, deforestation raises the temperature in homes by 1.8 1C and in aquatic habitats by 4.8-6.1 1C. In addition, these ambient temperature changes are associated with shorter gonotrophic cycles, reduced larva-toadult developmental time, and increased larval and adult survivorship all of which improve the vectorial capacity of the mosquitoes and increase exposure to malaria. In short, warmer microclimate means more rapid development of adult mosquitoes, which then live longer lives. This dramatically increases their ability to transmit malaria to human hosts.",

            "text": "In Asia, the relationship between deforestation and malaria is more complex. In part, this is because there are a wider variety of Anopheles species that are effective malaria vectors and have more variable habitat preferences. Unlike the Americas and Africa, much of the malaria transmission in Asia has occurred in forested areas. Almost all of the malaria transmission in Bangladesh in 1989 occurred in forests. In India, 7% of the population living in forested areas contributed 30% of the malaria in 1987. Deforestation in Asia has driven down the density of important malaria vectors including A. dirus, A. minimus, and A. barbirostris in Thailand, Nepal, India, and Sri Lanka. However, it has also caused an increase in the density of alternative vectors including A. fluviatilis, A. annularis, A. jamesii, A. nigerrimus, A. subpictus, and A. peditaeniatus. In an excellent review of over 60 studies of land use change and malaria, Yasuoka and Levins described the unpredictable nature of the impacts of these complex changes. In Kanchanaburi, Thailand, widespread deforestation from 1986 to 1995 eliminated breeding sites for A. dirus and decreased malaria incidence. However, in northeast India, deforestation increased malaria transmission by replacing the historical vector A. minimus with a more abundant vector: A. fluviatilis. In Sri Lanka, deforestation has led to major malaria epidemics. Given the complexity of malaria transmission in Asia, it is particularly hard to generalize the effects of deforestation on malaria exposure. However, what is clear from the research is that local changes in forest cover have had profound impacts on malaria exposure. Forest clearing has been credited with strong reductions in exposure and has also been implicated as a primary driver of major epidemics.",

Nearly half the human population suffers from one or more vector-borne diseases. Deforestation is one of the most pervasive features of global change. In most instances, the dramatic biological, geochemical, and hydrological changes associated with deforestation will strongly impact the dynamics of these insect-transmitted diseases. In the majority of diseases that have been studied, forest clearing has increased disease exposure. However, regardless of whether deforestation has a positive or negative impact on disease exposure, understanding the relationships is important in guiding disease surveillance and mitigation efforts. The importance of understanding these relationships between environmental change and vector-borne disease has been recently emphasized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of its emphasis on integrated vector management. Not all health consequences of deforestation are related to infectious disease. Over the past decade, investigators have uncovered an important association between deforestation in the Amazon basin and 'natural' mercury contamination, particularly of rivers. Deforestation, particularly 'slash and burn' clearing releases mercury that is naturally found in trees and soils. As a result, areas disturbed by deforestation have significantly higher mercury loads than upstream areas that remain intact. This is not a result of adding exogenous mercury to the environment through gold mining or other activities. The effect can be seen in watersheds that are hundreds of kilometers removed from the nearest gold mining operations. This 'natural' contamination has led to elevated mercury levels in fish and in the local people who eat them. Other investigators have demonstrated neurotoxicity in Amazonian forest dwellers even at very low levels of mercury contamination.",

By releasing carbon from soils and forest biomass and by decreasing carbon uptake from growing trees, deforestation has contributed roughly one quarter to the total rise in greenhouse gases. Climate change, itself, has significant public health impacts that are discussed in a different article of this encyclopedia. In addition to climate regulation, forests play an important role in maintaining a reliable supply of clean fresh water. Forest litter absorbs water, filters it, and releases it slowly over time. Deforestation causes more rapid runoff, increased sediment loads, and poorer water quality. It can lead to flooding and landslides as well as increased incidence of waterborne disease. In 1998, upstream deforestation played an important role in the Yellow River flood disaster that killed more than 3500 people, damaged over 7 million houses, submerged 25 million hectares of farmlands, and caused US$30 billion of damage. In the same year, Hurricane Mitch killed nearly 10 000 people in Central America and left roughly a million people homeless.

Rapid human population growth coupled with economic development and adoption of a western-style diet has required dramatic increases in global grain and meat production. Since 1960, global food production has risen by roughly two and a half times. To achieve these increases has required bringing more land into cultivation and pasturage -roughly 40% of the planet's ice-free land surface has been converted into croplands or pasture ( Figure 2) . The area of cultivated land is expected to continue increasing dramatically across the tropics due to unprecedented increases in global demand for food, feed, and fuel.

            "text": "One way that agriculture and animal husbandry impact health is by creating new ecological niches that favor organisms (mosquitoes, ticks, rodents, etc.) that play an important role in disease transmission. In South America, conversion of forest into grain cultivation combined with pesticide spraying and grain storage practices led to a boom in grain-eating rodent populations. These rodents were prime hosts for a group of hemorrhagic viruses (viruses that cause internal bleeding), and their explosion in numbers and anthropophilic behavior (living in and around human dwellings) led to serious outbreaks of fatal hemorrhagic disease. In Trinidad, in the 1940s, the development of cacao plantations caused a major malaria epidemic. The cacao was planted beneath nurse trees. The nurse trees provided ideal habitat for a type of plant that lives on the bark of the tree and pools moisture in a cup-like structure (epiphytic bromeliads). These bromeliads, in turn, created excellent breeding sites for the mosquito: A. bellator, the principal local malaria vector. The epidemic wasn't controlled until the nurse trees were reduced and plantation techniques were changed. Both cassava and sugarcane cultivation in Thailand led to reductions in the density of A. dirus but created widespread breeding grounds for a more effective malaria vector, A. minimus, with a resulting surge in malaria. In Cote d'Ivoire, cultivation of coffee and cacao plantations has been associated with exposure to African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). The plantations create habitat for the tsetse fly vector and cause exposure by bringing agricultural workers into contact with the vector. In a final example, the drainage and cultivation of papyrus swamps in highland Uganda appear to have increased the risk of malaria. Households located near drained and cultivated swamps had higher ambient temperatures and more A. gambiae mosquitoes (the principle vector of malaria in this area) per household than households in villages surrounding undisturbed papyrus swamps.",

The outbreak followed a period of heavy rainfall and runoff that contaminated Milwaukee's water supply despite new filtration and disinfection facilities. Fifty-four people died in the outbreak. Heavy rainfall and runoff has been associated with other cryptosporidiosis outbreaks. The protozoan is shed in the feces of many animals including ruminants like cows and sheep. Clearing of land for grazing, and the absence of forested buffer zones along river ways can increase runoff and lead to this type of contamination from animal manure. A second protozoan parasite, Giardia lamblia, is also shed by a variety of animals and can cause similar surface water contamination after periods of heavy precipitation.",

Caused by a wide variety of algae, these blooms can cause massive fish kills, shellfish poisonings, disease and death of marine mammals, and human morbidity and mortality. In the United States alone, roughly 60 000 individual cases and clusters of human intoxication occur annually. Health impacts range from acute neurotoxic disorders and death to subacute and chronic disease. The cost of HABs in the United States over a 15-year period was estimated to exceed $400 000 000.

The authors concluded that in 95% of observations (51 of 55), nutrient enrichment increased exposure to pathogens. An example of this type of process has been documented by researchers in Belize. Addition of nutrients from agricultural runoff has been shown to change the plant community in wetland areas, promoting the growth of dense cattail marshes (e.g., Typha spp.). This type of vegetation is favored by the mosquito, A. vestitipennis, which is a more efficient malaria vector than the mosquitoes it displaces.

Keeping these animals in close proximity to each other, for example, in Asian 'wet markets,' fosters this type of genetic exchange. The SARS epidemic is likely to have resulted from similar crowding of animals in live-animal markets in China. In this case, the species at the center of the epidemic were horseshoe bats and palm civet cats as amplifying hosts with a possible role for raccoon dogs and ferret badgers. Most of the early cases of SARS were among people who worked with the sale or handling of these animals. More complete understanding of the ecology of this type of zoonotic disease transmission could lead to less risky animal husbandry practices.

In general, dams and irrigation projects constructed in endemic areas tend to increase breeding habitat and transmission of malaria. Agricultural projects that combine deforestation with dams and irrigation can be a particularly potent combination for increasing malaria exposure, given their combined effects on breeding habitat and microclimate.",

This surge resulted from increased surface and subsurface moisture that created improved breeding sites for Culex pipiens, the mosquito vector of this disease. The widespread proliferation of schistosomiasis beyond lakes and river deltas has also been attributed to the proliferation of dams and irrigation projects. This parasitic disease is spread by fresh water snails that breed in still or slow-moving waters. Roughly 200 million people are estimated to suffer from schistosomiasis. Propagation of Rift Valley Fever, leishmaniasis, and Japanese encephalitis has also been associated with dams and irrigation projects.",

Over the past two centuries, the proportion of people living in cities or large towns has grown from approximately 5% to 50% and continues to climb. Between 1960 and 1980, the urban population in developing countries more than doubled. By 2025, urban population in developing countries is expected to account for well over half the global population. Urbanization is associated with a large variety of health impacts. Some of these impacts are likely to be positive. Some urban environments provide improved access to water and sanitation, a more reliable food supply, better security, and new employment opportunities that lead to improved income. Although the net effect of urbanization on global health is difficult to characterize, certain patterns of urbanization are clearly associated with higher risk of disease exposure. Some of these exposures fall within the realm of classic environmental health since they are not mediated by changes in the natural environment so much as by direct, toxic exposures. Urban air pollution, lead exposure, traffic accidents, and diseases associated with a more sedentary lifestyle are examples of classic environmental health problems that are only indirectly related to land use change.",

Much of the rapid urbanization occurring today is taking place in urban or periurban slums with few services for clean water provision, sewage disposal, solid waste management, or quality housing. Pools of contaminated water, water containers kept in homes, tires, and other refuse capable of holding water, and piles of municipal waste all create excellent habitat for a variety of arthropod vectors, particularly those that transmit dengue, malaria, filariasis, Chagas disease, plague, and typhus. In addition, rural to urban migration brings people from different disease endemic regions together in high density, providing a source for new infection as well as nonimmune hosts. A final contributing factor to the spread of vector-borne disease in slums is the poor quality housing that does not provide an effective barrier to mosquitoes, rodents, or fleas.",
