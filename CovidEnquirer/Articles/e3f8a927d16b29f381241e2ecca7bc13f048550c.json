Several viruses can modulate the formation of SG with different effects, but the relationship between SG formation and EV71 infection is poorly understood. In this study, we report that EV71 inhibits canonical SGs formation in infected cells and induces the formation of novel RNA granules that were distinguished from canonical SGs in composition and morphology, which we termed 'SG like structures'. Our results also demonstrated that EV71 triggered formation of SG-like structures is dependent on PKR and eIF2a phosphorylation and requires ongoing cellular mRNA synthesis. Finally, we found that SG-like structures are antiviral RNA granules that promote cellular apoptosis and suppress EV71 propagation. Taken together, our findings explain the formation mechanism of SG-like structures induced by EV71 and shed light on virus-host interaction and molecular mechanism underlying EV71 pathogenesis.",

Mammalian cells form two major kinds of cytoplasmic RNA granules to transiently store silenced messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs), including stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs). SGs form in response to various environmental stresses and serve as a place for mRNA storage and triage. However, PBs are usually present in unstressed cells at modest levels and respond to stress with increased size and quantity [1] . There are two pathways that can induce SG formation, the most popular being phosphorylation of eIF2a by a family of serine/threonine kinases, including PKR, PERK, HRI and GCN2, and another being eIF2a-independent mechanisms such as cleavage of eIF4G scaffold protein or inhibition of eIF4E helicase [2] . Generally, canonical SGs contain translational silent mRNAs, 40S ribosomal subunits, eukaryotic initiation factors (e.g., eIF4G, eIF4A and eIF3), and RNA binding proteins (e.g., G3BP1, TIA1, TIAR, HuR and PABP) [3] . Among these components, RNA binding protein HuR, TIA1, and G3BP1 are usually considered key proteins and used as the markers of SGs.",

For example, respiratory syncytial virus and mouse hepatitis coronavirus induce stable SG formation during the course of infection to benefit viral propagation [4, 5] . West Nile virus, Dengue virus and Rotavirus inhibit SG formation, presumably to antagonize their antiviral activity [6, 7] . Poliovirus and CVB3 induce transient SG formation early during infection, then disassemble them to facilitate viral replication [8, 9] . Vesicular stomatitis virus induces functional unknown cytoplasmic granules containing viral proteins and RNAs, but not some canonical SG markers [10] . Taken together, it can be concluded that, as the important constituent of host defense system, SGs play an important role in antiviral infection. EV71 was recently reported to induce SG formation in HeLa cells with high-dose, and viral protease 2A pro was found to be responsible for the SG formation [11, 12] . Despite these observations, the exact mechanism underlying EV71 induced SGs and the mutual regulative relationship between EV71 and SGs are still unclear.",

To investigate SG formation in EV71 infected cells, we categorized typical SG-defining markers and conducted a comprehensive time-course study examining their distribution. First, FISH was conducted to examine the distribution of poly(A)-mRNA, and the results showed that poly(A)-mRNA began to form cytoplasm foci at 6e7 h post-infection (pi) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1 ). The distribution of the 40S ribosomal subunit was then investigated and ribosomal protein S11 were taken as its marker. The results revealed that S11 in EV71 infected cells stayed unchanged and no S11-positive foci emerged throughout the duration of infection ( Fig. 1B and Fig. S1 ). Third, evaluation of initiation factor eIF4G and eIF3 showed they maintained an evenly distributed pattern and no cytoplasmic foci were formed over the whole period of infection ( Fig. 1C and Fig. S1 ). Finally, several common RNA-binding proteins of SGs including G3BP1, PABP, TIA-1, TIAR and HuR were detected. Surprisingly, these RNA-binding proteins performed differently. Specifically, TIA1, TIAR and HuR were mainly detected within the nucleus in mock-infected cells, but EV71 infection induced their translocation to cytoplasm and formed noticeable granular structures. This change began at 5 h pi, peaked at 6e7 h pi, and was then attenuated. However, other RNA-binding proteins (G3BP1 and PABP) appeared to be static during the infection time, they remained dispersed in the cytoplasm and did not produce granules ( Fig. 1D and Fig. S1 ). Taken together, these results suggested that EV71 infection can induce cytoplasmic foci containing some SG-defining markers. To further investigate the relationship of different protein aggregates in EV71 infected cells, multicolor fluorescent confocal monitoring of different markers was conducted to determine if these components were co-localized. We selected 7 h pi as the time-point since the foci formation of all molecules peaked at this time. The results showed that TIA1, TIAR, HuR and poly(A)-mRNA co-localized well with each other (Fig. 1E ). To gain insight into whether these granular structures also contain EV71 viral components associated with viral replication, we examined the viral dsRNA, which are intermediates of viral RNA replication and viral RNA polymerase 3D required for viral RNA replication by indirect immunofluorescence. We noticed that the RNA granules contained a portion of the viral dsRNA, but not polymerase 3D (Fig. 1F ), suggesting these structures may have some association with viral replication. Finally, to distinguish this structure from PBs, PB marker p54 was evaluated. The results showed that EV71 infection did not increase or enlarge p54 foci, but that it also destroyed the p54 foci originally present in mock-infected cells (Fig. 1G ). These findings indicated that EV71 may play a disruption role in PB formation and ruled out the possibility that the observed RNA granules are PBs.",

To exclude the possibility that there were problems within our detection system, we used arsenite and Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which are well known to induce formation of typical SGs, and selected HuR and G3BP1 as the markers to monitor the canonical SGs formation. Consistent with previous studies, arsenite and NDV induced canonical SGs that contained G3BP1 and HuR that co-localized well ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, these canonical SGs were morphologically different from EV71 induced RNA granules, being much larger in size ( Fig. 2A) . These findings suggested that EV71 induced RNA granules are not canonical SGs; therefore, we termed them 'SG-like structures'. To further explore the relationship between canonical SGs and EV71 induced SG-like structures, arsenite and NDV were used to induce SG formation in EV71 infected RD cells and SGs formation was assessed by double immuno-staining of G3BP1 and HuR. The results showed that the G3BP1 and HuR positive large particles induced by arsenite and NDV were no longer present and HuR positive microfoci were in their place ( Fig. 2B and C) in EV71 infected cells. These findings indicate that EV71 infection inhibits canonical SGs formation and induces its own characteristic RNA granules. ",

To explore the potential mechanism by which EV71 induce and regulate the formation of SG-like structures, we first examined the kinetics of eIF2a kinases activation and phosphorylation of eIF2a. Among four eIF2a kinases, we selected PKR and PERK to evaluate since they are often associated with the stress of viral infection. Western blot analysis showed that phosphorylation of PKR, PERK and eIF2a displayed similar kinetics, beginning at 6 h pi and then increasing as the infection proceeds (Fig. 3A) . To discriminate the responsible kinase for eIF2a phosphorylation, we used corresponding shRNA to knock down the expression of PKR and PERK in RD cells, then infected these cells with EV71 and assessed the extent of eIF2a phosphorylation. The results showed that EV71 induced eIF2a phosphorylation was obviously decreased in PKR knock down cells relative to control-shRNA and PERK-shRNA treated cells (Fig. 3B) , suggesting PKR is the dominant kinase to trigger eIF2a phosphorylation. Next, we checked the contribution of PKR to formation of EV71 induced SG-like structures using a RD cell line that stably expressed PKR-shRNA (PKR kd ) to monitor and quantify the SG-like structures after EV71 infection. The results showed that PKR down regulation severely decreased the frequency of SG-like structures in EV71 infected cells by about 50% per cell (Fig. 3C) . The same results were also achieved using 2-AP, a PKR inhibitor (Fig. 3D) . Finally, the role of eIF2a phosphorylation in SG-like structure formation was also determined. To accomplish this, we transfected RD cells with empty vector or phosphorylationdeficient mutant of eIF2a(S52A), then quantified the formation of SG-like structures under EV71 infection in both cells. We found that overexpression of phosphorylation-deficient eIF2a(S52A) obviously prevented the formation of SG-like structures, as indicated in a decrease in SG-like structures of about 30% relative to control cells (Fig. 3E) . These findings suggest that EV71 induces SG-like structures formation through PKR-eIF2a phosphorylation.",

Western blot showed that cleavage of PARP, a marker of cellular apoptosis, was weaker in PKR kd cells and 2-AP treated cells compared to that in control cells (Fig. 4A and B) , indicating that SG-like structures may play a beneficial role in EV71 induced cellular apoptosis. The results shown in Fig. 4B were also verified by flow cytometry analysis with Annexin V-FITC/PI (Fig. 4C) . Given that PKR is a multifunctional protein kinase in mammalian cells, we also evaluated downstream effectors of eIF2a to check the impact of SG-like structures on cellular apoptosis. To accomplish this, we transfected RD cells with empty vector or eIF2a(S52A). The results showed that cleavage of PARP was much weaker in eIF2a(S52A) transfected cells than that in the control (Fig. 4D) , suggesting that inhibition of SG-like structures formation through eIF2a phosphorylation also negatively affected cellular apoptosis.

Since G3BP1 is a critical SG component, we suspected that the cleaved G3BP1 may inhibit canonical SG formation in EV71 infected cells. In recent studies, Wu et al. reported that EV71 BrCr strain can induce canonical SGs formation in HeLa cells with a relatively high-dose EV71 (MOI \u00bc 50), and expression of EV71 2A pro alone was sufficient to cause SG formation [11, 12] . In the present study, we also found EV71 2A pro alone can induce canonical SG formation (Fig. S3) . However, this structure had not previously been detected in EV71 infected cells. We suspected that other viral components can antagonize the ability of 2A pro to induce the canonical SG. For example, 3C pro cleaves G3BP1 and may prevent EV71 from inducing canonical SGs; however, additional studies are needed to verify this. Additionally, the virus used in our study is a Fuyang stain, which caused the 2008 particular severe outbreak of HFMD in Fuyang, China. Differences in strains used among studies may also explain the conflicting findings in our study and others, and it is likely that SG-like structures formation in RD cells is EV71 strain specific.",

When SG-like structures were inhibited, the viral particles released into the cultural supernatants increased significantly. However, the expression of viral protein VP1 in cells did not exhibit obvious differences, suggesting that SG-like structures may not affect initiation of EV71 RNA replication and viral protein synthesis, but that they affect other steps of viral propagation such as viral particle assembly or release.",

Overexpression of these molecules results in SG formation, while their downregulation prevents the cells from forming SGs. To determine the key components in EV71 induced SG-like structures, we investigated each component of these structures. Among the identified constituents, only ongoing cellular mRNA synthesis is required for its formation, while TIA-1 and HuR did not influence the formation of these structures. We speculate that other critical molecules may exist in these structures, which would compensate for or substitute the function of TIA-1 and HuR; thus, more detailed studies are needed to elucidate the complicated composition of this structure.",

The formation of SG-like structures is dependent on phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2a and requires ongoing cellular mRNA synthesis. We also found that SG-like structures promote cellular apoptosis and inhibit EV71 viral propagation. Our findings improve our understanding of the virus-host interaction and provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanism underlying EV71infection.",
