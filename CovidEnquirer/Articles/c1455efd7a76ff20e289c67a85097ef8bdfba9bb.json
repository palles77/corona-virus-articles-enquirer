All hospitals reported at least 1 airborne isolation room in the ED with the median number being 5 (12.7%) of total ED beds. Nearly all of the hospitals (25 out of 26) had airborne isolation rooms (median, 4 rooms) with negative pressure capabilities. A majority of respondents (17 of 25; 68%) reported that all airborne isolation rooms either vented directly outdoors or utilized high efficiency particulate air filters for vented air, but 3 respondents were unsure of what technology was used and 1 did not respond. The number of anterooms attached to an airborne isolation room ranged from 0-4, with 61% of facilities reporting 0 ante-rooms. Twenty-one of 26 respondents (81%) reported a positive level of confidence that the number of isolation beds was adequate for their needs on a routine basis.

            "text": "The need for negative pressure isolation has been present for years as a practice within the infectious diseases community. The 2012 Red Book of the American Academy of Pediatrics lists as part of the requirement for airborne precautions the use of \"special ventilation, including 6 to 12 air changes per hour, air flow direction from surrounding area to the room, and room air exhausted directly to the outside or re-circulated through a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA).\" 4 A review of 40 selected articles on this topic in 2007 concluded with recommendations for negatively pressured isolation rooms for patients with airborne-transmitted diseases because there was sufficient evidence to support an association between ventilation and air movement with disease transmission. 5 A recent study from Australia determined the risk related to ventilation in different settings and showed the protective value of negative pressure isolation. 6 A Canadian review pointed out the value of prompt transfer of a patient with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome into a negative isolation room and use of N-95 masks, which resulted in no secondary cases in 1 hospital. Conversely, an 18-hour wait in a general waiting room led to a city outbreak of 300 cases, 77% of which were hospital-acquired. These authors argue that negative isolation (ie, airborne isolation) rooms should be a requirement for all hospital ED rooms. 7 Two studies examined existing ED capacity for this requirement. In the United Kingdom, only 24% of hospitals had isolation rooms and of those only 61% had independent ventilation. 8 In a wider European study of EDs and medical admission departments from hospital referral centers for highly infectious diseases, 82.9% had isolation rooms, 50% of which had negative isolation, and 29.3% had high-efficiency particulate air filters for exhausted air. 9 The situation among pediatric EDs in the United States from our survey showed that nearly all responders had negative pressure isolation room capability with a median of 4 airborne isolation ED rooms. Although 81% of respondents believed their respiratory isolation capacities were adequate, it is uncertain how these facilities would contain pandemic respiratory disease. Another concern arises with 16 of 26 facilities reporting no ante-rooms in the ED. This deficiency was highlighted by the assessment of capability needed for Ebola virus disease suspects because current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention call for doffing space or ante-rooms. 10 This study has several limitations, including being a convenience sample. Also, data were collected in 2012, so it may not be reflective of current ED capabilities.",
