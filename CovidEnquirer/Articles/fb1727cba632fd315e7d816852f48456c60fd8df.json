Conventional methods for virus detection are labourious, time consuming, and only a single virus can be analysed in one assay. Objectives: The objective of this study was to develop a novel real-time PCR method for multiple virus detection by melting curve analysis using Taqman probes in a single reaction. Study design: As a model, six respiratory viruses were detected in one tube using three fluorophores. The specificity was assessed by cross-reaction tests with other common respiratory pathogens. The analytical sensitivity was assessed by testing the limit of detection of the assay using artificial plasmids as the positive template. The clinical evaluation of the established assay was evaluated for the detection of respiratory viruses in clinical samples, and the results were compared with direct fluorescent antibody testing (DFA). Results: The six respiratory viruses were clearly distinguished by their respective melting temperature values in the corresponding fluorescence detection channels. No cross reactions were observed by cross reaction tests. The detection limits of this assay were 2 to 2 \u00d7 10 3 copies per reaction for each virus. The clinical evaluation of this assay was demonstrated by analysing 352 clinical samples, and 67(19.0%) samples were positive for at least one virus. The accordance rate between the established PCR and DFA testing was high, and ranged from 94.57% to 100%. Conclusions: Taqman probe-based melting curve analysis is well suited for detection of multiple viruses in clinical and research laboratories because of its high throughput, reliability, and cost savings.",

After optimization, PCR and melting curve analysis were performed on a LightCycler 480II real-time system (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) in a 25-\u03bcL reaction containing 1 \u00d7 PCR buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 3.0 mM MgCl 2 , 2.5 U mTaq DNA polymerase, primers and probes as listed in Table 1 , and 2 \u03bcL cDNA template.

Because the Tm values of FluA and FluB are too close, their melting peaks are fused and generate a wide melting peak with a Tm value between them when they are positive at the same time.

            "text": "Compared with other virus detection techniques, this novel multiplex PCR has many advantages. First, the number of detectable targets is significantly increased in our 2D-label multiplex PCR when compared with those multiplex PCR assays using a label that involves either Tm or fluorophore alone (Wan et al., 2016; Simmons et al., 2016) . In this study, 2 probes with discriminable Tm values were designed in each channel. It might be possible to design more probes in one channel, and then the number of targets detected in a single tube could be further enhanced. Second, this novel multiplex PCR is cost-effective. The cost of a probe-based real-time PCR assay primarily depends on the consumption of the fluorescence probe, and the TaqMan probe used in our study was easy to design and synthesize. The cost was lower than Fig. 2 . Sensitivity of the multiplex PCR using serially diluted templates (10 5 , 10 4 , 10 3 , 10 2 , 10, and 1 copies/\u03bcl). NC, negative control. probes with special modifications such as PNA and FRET. One peculiar requirement is asymmetric amplification, which is easy to perform without extra cost (Huang et al., 2011) . Third, this multiplex PCR can be performed with almost any real-time PCR machine, making it possible for wide application in the clinical laboratory for multiple virus detection. Similar to most other PCR methods, this novel multiplex PCR is fast and can be completed within 3 h. Therefore enabling results, including sample processing, nucleic acid extraction and analysis to be obtained within a single working day. However, there are some limitations of the multiplex PCR based on probe melting curve analysis. First, the TaqMan probes were designed based on the known sequence of conserved genes. As new variants of the virus continue to emerge, it might be possible that some variants could lead to mismatch of the probe against the target sequence, which could cause a Tm shift from the predefined values. In this regard, the established assay should be updated on an as needed basis. Second, as an end-point detection assay, melting curve analysis-based multiplex PCR is non-quantitative in nature and therefore restricts its application in virus quantitative detection. However, as shown in Fig. 2 , the signal of the melting curves increased with increasing template concentrations within a certain range. In some cases, we observed that when the concentration of template exceeds a certain standard, an increase of concentration does not result in the expected increase in the melt peaks, and sometimes they are even reduced (Fig. 2, PIV1 ). The reason is that after reaching the amplification plateau, complementary DNA strands rapidly anneal to one another and fall out of the reaction, whereas the excessive single-stranded DNA continues to be available to the primer and be converted into the double stranded form. As a result, the concentration of the single-stranded DNA in asymmetric PCR may be decreased after reaching plateau (Botezatu et al., 2015) . Third, the application of melting curve analysis increases the time required for analysis compared with standard real-time PCR. Another limitation is that the analytical sensitivity of the multiplex PCR is not high enough, especially for RSV, PIV2, and FluB. Further optimization of the reaction is needed.",

This method is expected to be widely used in clinical and research laboratories due to its high throughput nature and easy application when compared with traditional methods such as DFA. Furthermore, this strategy can be modified and extended to detect additional pathogens responsible for many other infectious diseases, such as meningitis, gastrointestinal infections and bloodstream infections.",
