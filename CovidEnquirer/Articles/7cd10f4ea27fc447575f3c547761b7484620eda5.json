The first biochemical evidence for the co-or posttranslational processing of the coronavirus RNA polymerase gene product(s) came from the in vitro translation of MHV genomic RNA. 21 Subsequently, these data were confirmed by the in vitro translation of synthetic mRNA. 22' 23 Using the same approach, the position of a proteinase activity, responsible for the cleavage of an amino-terminal polypeptide (p28) from the MHV ORF la translation product, has been mapped to the first papain-like proteinase domain of the ORF la polyprotein. Site-specific mutation of putative catalytic residues in this domain confirmed that two amino acids, Cys-l137 and His-1288, are essential for this activity. 24 The p28 cleavage site has been positioned at the dipeptide Gly-247/Val-248 in the MHV ORF la gene product, and the role of the amino acids flanking the cleavage site has been investigated by mutational analysisY",

However, when using this method, the importance of the overall conformation for accessibility of potential cleavage sites within the substrate should be recognized. To minimize these structural influences on cleavage, sets of overlapping peptide sequences, each of them containing identical potential cleavage sites, should be used as proteinase substrates. Furthermore, as is shown in Fig. 6 , the uncleaved fusion protein does not mediate proteolytic activity. This demonstrates that the release of the proteinase from the fusion protein is required for enzymatic activity.",

However, only when specific radioactive amino acids are incorporated at the amino termini of the cleavage products can the exact position of the cleavage site be determined by sequence analysis. Sometimes there are theoretical limitations inherent in this approach and, in almost all cases, the procedure is relatively expensive. An alternative method is to use bacterial-expressed polypeptides as substrates for cleavage. In this case, the cleavage products can usually be produced in sufficient amounts to allow for chemical (i.e., nonradioactive) sequence analysis.

In contrast, the analysis of coronavirus RNA polymerase gene expression is incomplete and has, to date, relied heavily upon methods such as in vitro transcription and translation or the expression of gene products in bacterial systems. In the context of virus infection, the analysis of the coronavirus RNA polymerase gene expression will require the development of a large panel of sensitive and specific immunological reagents and, ultimately, the construction of an infectious coronavirus cDNA clone. Similarly, the analysis of coronavirus RNA polymerase gene function is rudimentary. The analysis of polymerase activity in subcellular fractions of coronavirus-infected cells or in permeabilized cells has proven unsatisfactory.
