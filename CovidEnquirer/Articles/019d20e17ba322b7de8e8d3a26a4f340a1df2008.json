Rodriguez An epidemiologic study in the United Kingdom reported that 4% to 11% of the deaths among llamas and 17% to 33% of deaths in alpacas occur during the first 6 months of life. A high proportion of these deaths occur within the first week of life. 1 In South America, cria mortality rates before weaning may reach 50%, mostly caused by Clostridium perfringens (types A and C). 2 As in other domestic animal species, most neonatal deaths are associated with events occurring during parturition and the immediate postpartum period such as dystocia, poor mothering ability, or exposure. Poor mothering ability includes not only behavior problems such as rejection but mostly poor milk production. Neonatal care and early recognition and treatment of neonatal ailments are of the utmost importance to reduce these losses.",

During parturition, it is possible that the neonate may be affected by a damaging degree of anoxia. Several mechanisms help the neonate to adapt to extrauterine life. The first is an increase in fetal cortisol concentration, which triggers parturition and allows adequate levels of surfactant to be produced by type II alveolar pneumocytes. In addition to elevated cortisol concentration, a catecholamine surge occurs. A negative side effect of this physiologic feature is that it may allow potential problems to be masked and the newborn to appear normal immediately after parturition, even though it may have substantial physiologic impairment. 5 Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment of neonatal disease, particularly infections, results in greater positive outcome. 6 The clinical signs are often nonspecific and vague, which results in a neonate that is slow to adapt to extrauterine life or that dies suddenly in the first few days of life. If an intrauterine infection exists, the fetus may be born alive or may die in utero. Intrauterine infections of bacterial origin in the newborn camelid are recognized more commonly compared with viral infections. Infections acquired in utero rather than in the postpartum period should be suspected if the newborn has elevated plasma fibrinogen in the first 12 to 24 hours of life, the placenta appears abnormal, or the dam exhibits vaginal discharge during parturition. 6, 7 ",

Regular weighing of the cria (daily for the first 2 weeks and once every other week thereafter) is warranted to determine the adequacy of milk production and intake. Birth weights vary significantly from one farm to another and reflect most likely the feeding management on that farm as well as genetic influence (Table 25 -2). A tendency toward higher birth weight than originally described has been observed in many alpaca farms in North America. In alpacas in South American conditions, birth weights have tended to increase with increasing age of the dam, and low birth weights have been associated with an increased risk of neonatal death. 8 Birth weights tend to decrease after 11 years. 8 No studies have been performed on the effect of the sire on birth weight in these species. It is not uncommon for crias to lose some weight in the first 24 hours (120 to 250 grams [g] in alpacas and 250 to 500 g in llamas). In alpacas, the average daily weight gain in crias is 195 g under grazing conditions in South America. 3 Disinfection of the umbilical cord is a significant line of defense against infection. If the birth is observed to have occurred in a clean birthing area, the umbilicus should be trimmed and dipped in 2% to 3% tincture of iodine. If the birth did not occur in a clean area, it is advisable to clean the umbilicus with diluted (0.5%) chlorhexidine solution or soapy water and to dip or spray the umbilicus with regularstrength betadine solution. Umbilical cord dipping should be performed two to three times in the first 24 hours. It is important to protect the newborn cria from low or high temperatures.",

It is highly recommended that alpaca and llama breeding operations be prepared for a possible need for colostrum supplementation by having a stock of frozen caprine or bovine colostrum. Veterinary clinics can play a role in colostrum banking for their clients. Colostrum should be collected from healthy dams and stored properly. Our recommendation is to store colostrum in individual feeding units (60 to 90 milliliters [mL]) using regular freezer bags or freezer bags for human breast milk. All bags should be labeled with identification of the dam and date of collection. Ideally, colostrum should be frozen at -20\u00b0C or in a scientific freezer. Colostrum should not be frozen in a frost-free freezer. Adequately prepared and frozen colostrum keeps its properties for at least 1 year. Frozen colostrum should be thawed out slowly and brought up to body temperature before administration. Rapid thawing at high temperature or in a high-power microwave is not good because it may denature the antibodies in colostrum. Thawing is best accomplished by placing small quantities of colostrum-containing bags in a water bath at body temperature.",

Some practitioners prefer to give 5% of body weight in a feeding followed by another feeding of equal quantity 6 to 8 hours later because small intake volumes may accelerate gut closure for colostrum. The best way to administer colostrum is by bottle-feeding. In case of poor suckling reflex, colostrum may be administered via orogastric intubation .

Predisposing factors for sepsis are similar to those described in other species, namely prematurity, placentitis, and/or contaminated or crowded birthing facilities, dystocia, failure of passive transfer and lack or improper care of the umbilical stump. In one study the median age at presentation of crias with sepsis was 2 days. 6 Presence of hypopion, uveitis, and/or conjunctivitis indicate early septicemia.

[14] [15] [16] Since the SRID is species specific, it will not be accurate, if colostrum other than that of camelids was used. Using Triple J Plates (Triple J Farms, Bellingham WA) levels greater than 800 mg/ dL are considered adequate, and levels less than 400 mg/dL are considered an indication of failure of passive transfer. However, most studies consider 1000 mg/mL to be the minimum cutoff value for adequate passive transfer. 14, 15 Failure of passive transfer should be suspected if total solids determined by refractometer are less than 4.5 g/dL, whereas values greater than 5.5 g/dL are consistent with adequate passive transfer. 14 However, others have found that this test is not very accurate. 17 If samples are taken at birth and compared with samples at 24 hours, the packed cell volume (PCV) will be observed to be reduced and the total solids increased, indicating that the cria is more hydrated and that the rise of total protein is caused by significant passive transfer. Serum total protein and globulin should be at least 5.5 g/dL and 2 g/dL, respectively. 17 However, it is important to remember that these parameters may be falsely increased in case of dehydration. Commercial sulfate turbidity tests are available but not as sensitive as the SRID. 14",

Crias presented with anemia should be checked for Mycoplasma hemolamae infection. 27 The outcome of medical management of septic neonates is generally favorable if there is no gastrointestinal or central nervous system involvement. 6 Total or partial parenteral nutrition should be considered in severely depressed crias that are unable to nurse. 28, 29 Failure of Passive Transfer (FPT) Failure of passive transfer is a major cause of neonatal mortality in camelids. 10, 15, 16 In cases of FPT hyperimmune warm (37\u00b0C) plasma should be given IV or intraperitoneally at a dose of 15 to 25 ml/kg. A rate of 100 to 200 mL/hr. has been suggested for IV administration in crias. However faster rates have been anecdotally reported by practitioners. The volume of pre-warmed plasma to be administered varies from 300 mL for alpacas to 500 mL for llamas. Crias that are weak or unable exercise in crias with severe heart defects. Several factors, including genetics, teratogenic viral infections, or teratogenic drug or plant intoxication, as well as abnormal uterine environment, may contribute to the development of congenital abnormalities. Often the practitioner is faced with four main questions: (1) Is the defect genetic? (2) Is it lethal? (3) Will the defect affect the welfare of the animal? (4) Will the defect be exacerbated by reproduction (i.e., pregnancy)? 34 Unfortunately, available data do not always answer these questions. It is essential that clients be educated about the necessity to perform a necropsy on stillborn or dead neonates to determine exactly the cause of the death, if possible. In many cases, more than one abnormality is found to be present. Without proper diagnosis, no action can be taken to understand the genetic nature of some of these abnormalities.",

These signs progress to anorexia, bloating, and signs of abdominal discomfort. Initial treatment consists of one or two warm soapy water enemas (20 to 40 mL). If after two enemas, the meconium has not passed, intravenous fluids may be indicated. Multiple soapy water enemas may irritate the rectal mucosa and result in severe straining and rectal prolapse. 12 Various preparations, including magnesium sulfate, human phosphate preparations, and acetylcysteinecontaining preparations, have been used. The last are particularly helpful when meconium is very dry and sticky. Neonates that have retained meconium may have other abnormalities and should be examined closely.
