The device is capable of providing high recovery rates even for microorganisms which are rather sensitive to physical and biological stresses. However, some mathematical procedure is required for realistic calculation of an actual concentration of viable bioaerosols in the air taking into account a rate of inactivation of targeted microorganisms, sampling parameters, and results of microbial analysis of collecting liquid from the sampler. In this paper, we develop such procedure along with the model of aerosol propagation for outdoor conditions. Combining these procedures allows one to determine the optimal sampling locations for the best possible coverage of the area to be monitored. A hypothetical episode concerned with terrorists' attack during music concert in the central square of Novosibirsk, Russia was considered to evaluate possible coverage of the area by sampling equipment to detect bioaerosols at various locations within the square. It was found that, for chosen bioaerosol generation parameters and weather conditions, the new personal sampler would be capable to reliably detect pathogens at all locations occupied by crowd, even at distances of up to 600 m from the source. r",

The operational principle is based on passing of air sample through porous medium submerged into a layer of collecting liquid. As the result, during passing through narrow and tortuous channels inside the porous medium, the air stream is split into a multitude of very small bubbles with the particulates are being scavenged by these bubbles and, thus, effectively removed before the effluent air leaves the device. Bioaerosol particles are being accumulated in the collecting liquid during the entire process of sampler operation. verification of the sampler for monitoring of common viruses with different levels of sensitivity to physical and biological stresses showed that it can recover up to 25% of rather labile Influenza virus, whilst a very robust and stable Vaccinia virus is being recovered at the level of 90% (Agranovski et al., 2005a,b) . A higher survival level of biological material was observed when the sampler was tested on bacteria (Agranovski et al., 2002) .",

As the result, along with time related increase of the number of collected viral particles, the competitive process of their inactivation will take place in collecting fluid. Linear approximation of the live virus concentration values, C s (t), in the collecting fluid for different bubbling time periods t results in the exponential dependence of biological activity of viruses on the time: n(t) \u00bc n(0) exp(\u00c0t/t), where t is the time of the virus activity decrease by a factor of e % 2:72.

For viral assays, 100 mL of collecting liquid is added into each well containing monolayer of corresponding cells. For practical situations, six wells are used for each measurement making the total amount of analyzed liquid-600 mL. Considering, that 1 PFU (plaque forming unit) can be detected, the minimal countable concentration of virus is 1 PFU per 600 mL of liquid, which corresponds to $2 PFU mL \u00c01 . Considering that the sensitivity of viral assay is lower compared to bacteria/fungi detection, 2 units mL \u00c01 (worst case scenario) is taken for further consideration. This value, for the sampling flowrate of 4 L min \u00c01 and particle collection efficiency assumed to be 100% (such assumption is supported by our previous tests of the sampler collection efficiency, Agranovski et al., 2002) , corresponds to the airborne microbial concentration of approximately 2.5 \u00c2 10 4 /T(min) units m \u00c03 .

The coordinate axis z is directed vertically upwards, and axes x and y in the horizontal plane eastwards and northwards, respectively. It should be noted that the derivation of the semi-empiric equation also implies the fulfillment of the condition that the time of atmospheric pollutant spread T should be much larger than the Euler time scale t \u00f0E\u00de . Thus, the formulas for determining unbiased estimates of the concentration of bioaerosols and the used method of simulation of the concentration fields are mutually intercoordinated. To solve Eq. (11), it is necessary to set values of hU x i, hU y i, hU z i and K x , K y , K z . The numericanalytical model (Desyatkov et al., 1996) was used to preset the values hU x i, hU y i, hU z i. In this model the presence of buildings, trees and other elements of usual outdoor environment is taken into account by presetting the corresponding roughness parameters of the underlying surface. The components of the tensor of turbulent diffusion coefficients K x , K y , K z were preset in accordance with the hypothesis of their proportionality to the corresponding components of the tensor of Reynolds viscous stresses experimentally justified under natural conditions (Borodulin, 1996) . These components, in their turn, were determined using the algebraic model for turbulent flows and stresses similar to Teverovskii and Dmitriev (1988) .",

The concert was hold from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. local time under meteorological conditions typical for the middle of July. The territory on which there was a crowd is shown in Fig. 3 with a dotted square. South-western wind was preset in the calculations with the velocity of 2 m s \u00c01 at the height z \u00bc 5 m above the underlying surface at the western boundary of the area under study, point ''A'' in Fig. 3 . According to the legend, during the concert the ''terrorists'' performed concealed use of a preparation of a highly pathogenic viral strain in aerosol form. A car with the aerosol source was running along the central street of the city crossing the square at the speed of 18 km h \u00c01 . The source is shown by a solid line with an arrow in Fig. 3 . The spraying line was 250 m long. A total of 250 g of the preparation with the concentration of viral particles of 5 \u00c2 10 10 g \u00c01 was discharged into the atmosphere along the spraying line at the height of 2 m above the underlying surface. The spraying started at 3 p.m. It lasted for 40 s, which was much shorter than the concert duration. On this basis, the parameter hQi was preset as an ''instant'' linear source that occurred at 3 p.m. local time. Considering that the virus used by ''terrorists'' was very robust, the value b could be taken as zero. Aerodynamic diameter of particles was preset equal to 5 mm. Obviously, for the conditions set up for this case, V s value could be neglected. The calculations were performed on the difference template of 51 \u00c2 35 \u00c2 50 nodes with a step of 20 m along the horizontal line and 1.5 m along the vertical line, respectively. Fig. 4 presents the dependence of the number concentration of virus-containing aerosols hCi on the spreading time calculated at the height z \u00bc 1.5 m above the underlying surface for points marked in Fig. 3 as 1 and 2 .

The dispersion of the unbiased estimate of the concentration s 2 mes decreases with T increase and increases with a decrease in t=t \u00f0E\u00de parameter. The values of the countable concentration of virus-containing aerosols lower than the threshold values determined by Eq. (10) cannot be considered as reliable. Considering a very high physical collection efficiency of the sampler (Agranovski et al., 2002) , in our calculations we assumed this value to be unity, however, the particular number corresponding to the size of targeted microorganism can be obtained from our previous paper (Agranovski et al., 2002) and directly used to correct the final results (the minimal measurable concentration in the air should be divided by the collection efficiency).",
