Serologic evidence of infection (IgM and IgG hemagglutinin-inhibition antibody) was documented in this and another contact animal. The genetic sequence of the virus was homologous with the human epidemic influenza B strains circulating in 1995 -1998. Additionally, serologic evidence of influenza B infection was documented in eight of 600 seals sampled after 1995. Although the mechanism of transmission remains unknown, this is the first time a human influenza B virus has been found to have caused natural infection in an animal species.

Thus, planning for a pandemic is a process that involves developing strategies and building expertise and infrastructures to deal with an unpredictable and perhaps catastrophic event, and anticipating from past experiences the possible unexpected consequences of certain strategies and interventions. Planning should accomplish two objectives: (1) effective assessing the pandemic risk; and (2) define the role and possible actions of the various medical and public health institutions. Pandemic preparedness was addressed by a panel of experts. (WHO) The roles of the WHO are to maintain a global influenza surveillance network that will facilitate the detection of novel influenza viruses during interpandemic periods, and to declare the onset and end of a pandemic. Significant collaboration worldwide is necessary to accomplish this. National health authorities in all countries should establish a pandemic planning committee for decision making regarding surveillance, scientific and medical issues, supply and distribution of antiviral drugs, and management of the pandemic, taking into consideration communication, legal, political and economical issues (JID, 1997) . Countries should make the best use of available resources to reduce the impact of disease.

Early detection of new influenza strains is crucial for a rapid response to a pandemic threat. For recent influenza pandemics, a gap of several months occurred between the time that widespread outbreaks of influenza were occurring and the time the virus was first isolated. This was true for the 1957 pandemic, the 1968 pandemic and for the H1N1 virus in 1977. Many surveillance lessons were learned from the experience with the H5N1 outbreak in 1997 (Snacken et al., 1999) . In this case, the WHO network identified a single isolate of H5N1 early in the process, allowing for local preparations, but the need for better surveillance in Asia, particularly in China, was apparent. We learned how difficult it is to enhance global and even national surveillance and that there is a great need for expanded influenza surveillance in animals. We learned that influenza viruses can jump the host species barrier without reassortment and that there is a need to have an increased availability of biosafety level 3 containment facilities worldwide to study highly virulent viruses. The need for training for surveillance became obvious as well.",

Practical issues to consider include how to provide a vaccine supply quickly and to optimally use available doses. There are often delays in the preparation of a vaccine from the time the virus is first identified to the time the vaccine is ready for distribution. The WHO plan considers distribution of candidate vaccines and many national plans list vaccine as an intervention, but do not have a plan for obtaining it. If all candidate virus subtypes were prepared in advance, vaccine production could be shortened to 11 or 12 weeks, compared with the normal 22 -23 week process. Nevertheless, there are major questions to be answered: how much antigenic variation is there within each subtype? Are the current virus subtype strains representative of all the candidates? How much and who will cover the costs of preparing candidate vaccines and how would we select the variants for stock piling and vaccine preparation? Since the world population would largely be susceptible to a new subtype, one possibility would be to use the most antigenically similar available strain to obtain a degree of immunologic priming within that subtype and a decrease in the severity of disease in these immunized individuals. An alternate mechanism would be to use recombinant live attenuated viruses that may induce a broader spectrum of immune responses than inactivated vaccine. At this time, it is possible to prepare these various subtype reagents knowing that some might not be used.",

One is that the H1 sequence of the 1918 virus was derived from a reassortment event with a bird HA sequence with very few modifications. Avian sequences have drifted more in the last 30 years than previously thought, therefore the 1918 avian sequence would be expected to be very different from modern avian H1 sequences. Within the H1 domain, the nearest avian sequence to the 1918 virus differs by 26 amino acids; in 1957 the nearest avian sequence differs by 15, in 1968 by nine, and in 1987 by one or two amino acids. Drift in avian H1 through the years could have occurred and the 1918 H1 could be from an avian source with very little modification, but represent an avian-like virus that is no longer available. The other possibility is that the avian ancestor of the pandemic virus had been adapting in mammals for a period of time; estimates are for an appearance of the virus around 1910-1915.",

The 1918 sequence is very close to the sequence of the common ancestor of both human and classic swine N1, and originates near the root of the mammalian clade.

The signs and symptoms of the common cold include rhinorrea, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. RV causes a significant rhinitis, but disease also involves the sinuses, causing a rhino-sinusitis, and, not infrequently, abnormalities in Eustachian tube function and middle ear pressure (Gwaltney and Ruckert, 1997) . The viral sinusitis is a self-limited illness characterized by thick secretions in the sinuses that are seen on computed tomography (CT) in up to 87% of adults. The maxillary sinus of an adult contains an average volume of 30 ml. Drainage occurs through the 3 mm diameter infundibulum. The sinus cavity contains a few seromucous glands, but many more goblet cells; RV infection may stimulate mucous production by these goblet cells.

During an outbreak that occurred between April and June 1996, children died of a previously unrecognized entity characterized by cardiopul-monary failure and arrythmias. A new virus called SIBU virus was identified in cerebrospinal fluid, brain or heart in 12 of 28 children (Cardosa et al., 1999) . This virus was also associated with acute non fatal flacid paralysis in four children. This emerging virus is fastidious, shows tropism for the central nervous system and is associated with cardiac arrest; it appears to be related to subgenus B viruses.",

Virion fibers are of different lengths and serve as ligands between the capsid and host cell receptors. The variation in length is necessary for the virus to overcome differences in the charge of the viral capsid and the cell surface, which is usually acidic. Sequencing of the fiber genes of members of all subgenera revealed that the isoelectric point of the outer part of the fiber -the knob -ranged from 4.5 to 9.5. Within the fiber knob, two domains have been identified. The first domain contains tyr260 and arg279 which, when mutated to his260 and glu279, loses hemagglutination capacity. Adenoviruses with a predilection for the eye display a high positive charge of the fiber knob. For these adenoviruses the most alkaline region (with an isoelectric point of 10.4) corresponds to the second domain that is delimited by ala223 and lys251. These two amino acid residues are unique for adenoviruses that cause epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Adenoviruses of subgenera A, C, D, E, and F exhibit affinity for the coxsackie -adenovirus host cell receptor (CAR), a pentameric integrin; but Ad37d, which causes epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, binds to sialic acid on host cell glycoproteins.",

Although the disease is generally considered a bacterial disease and treated with antibiotics, it is now clear that respiratory viruses play a significant role in both the pathogenesis, clinical course and outcome of AOM. Ten to 57% of children with a viral URTI will develop AOM concurrently or shortly after the URTI.

Many of these substances have been shown to induce an inflammatory process that leads to mucocilliary damage, dysfunction, and impaired middle ear ventilation. Experimental influenza infection in animals results in middle ear pressure changes, tympanic membrane inflammation, damage, disappearance of ciliated epithelial cells, and increased Eustachian tube mucous and cellular debris.

Both CD4 and CD8 T cells are involved in recovery and pathogenesis of RSV disease, and the balance between protective and disease-enhancing effects of T cells is important in considering development of intervention strategies. It has also been observed that there is a correlation between severity of disease and increased IgE and histamine production, especially in children with asthma.

The studies reported here are concerned with efforts to improve present vaccines by supplementation of the predominant hemagglutinin (HA) antigens with recombinant NA (rNA) (Couch et al., 1974; Johansson et al., 1995 Johansson et al., , 1998 . Based on extensive animal studies and previous clinical trials with HA/NA antigenic hybrids, we anticipate that addition of purified NA will: (1) insure that the NA in vaccines is present in adequate amounts; (2) balance the ratio of HA to NA to reduce antigenic competition in which the predominant anti-HA response is suppressive to the anti-NA response; (3) provide adequate amounts of an antigen less subject to antigenic drift (NA), thus providing back-up immunity when the vaccine HA does not match well that of a new virus.",

The genetic basis of attenuation has been defined for various RSV or PIV vaccine candidates and this information has been used to generate a large menu of attenuating mutations for both RSV and PIV. Specific mutations such as deletions and animal gene substitutions offer the possibility of heightened stability of the attenuation phenotype following replication in vivo. It is now possible to combine mutations from this menu to derive novel attenuated viruses that exhibit the proper balance between replication, attenuation, and immunogenicity that is needed for a successful live attenuated vaccine. It is also possible to rapidly produce new vaccine candidates by antigenic chimerization in which the protective antigens of one virus are substituted for those in a serotypically different vaccine candidate that has previously been shown to exhibit the right level of attenuation.

Generally the RSV vaccine is given as nose drops in one dose of 10 4 -10 5 PFU but two doses at a 1 month interval have been given to younger children (Karron et al., 1997) . Infection with an RSV cold adapted-temperature sensitive attenuated vaccine (cpts 248/404) did not result in febrile or lower respiratory tract disease in seropositive and seronegative children 6-24 months of age, nor in children 1-2 months of age. In the younger children nasal congestion occurred about 8-10 days after vaccine administration, lasting 24 h and it was accompanied by difficulty sleeping or feeding. This, along with the fact that the virus was replicating at fairly high titers, indicates a need for further attenuation of this virus. There was no relationship between the amount and pattern of virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract and the level of maternally acquired antibody or age of the child. In the youngest children, minimal virus shedding was noted after a second dose of vaccine among those who shed virus after the first dose. The protection conferred, however, was not apparently related to the development of a detectable serum IgG antibody response. Most children over 6 months of age had a serum IgG antibody response to the F and/or G protein in ELISA; however, only a few children under 6 months of age demonstrated a response after two doses, and virtually none after a single dose. However, 80% of 1-2-month-old infants developed serum IgA antibody and 40% developed nasal wash IgA antibody. Antibody was mostly directed to the G protein. Viral shedding was noted after the second dose of vaccine only among those with no serum IgA antibody response. Thus, a potential correlate of immunity was identified.

The NWS T /G70C reassortant had no mutations, but was almost 100-fold less sensitive to zanamavir than either parent in a plaque reduction assay. It was also less sensitive to zanamavir in mice than the Tokyo parent virus, and had lower infectivity. Treatment of cells with purified NA showed that the G70C NA was more efficient at removing the receptors to which the NWS T was bound.

When new viruses enter human populations, vaccines are not available and antiviral drugs are critical for prophylaxis and therapy until vaccines can be prepared. GS4071 (the active metabolite of oseltamivir) inhibited the replication of H5N1 and H9N2 influenza viruses in MDCK cells with IC 50 values ranging from 7.5 to 10 mM and the neuraminidase enzyme activity of both viruses with IC 50 values ranging from 7 to 15 nM. In murine models, H5N1 virus is lethal; but, for H9N2, larger doses of virus are required to cause death. Oral oseltamivir at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg per day exerted protective efficacy against these viruses in infected mice; 1 mg/kg per day prevented death in 100% of mice infected with 5 LD50 of either H5N1 virus or H9N2 virus.

Approximately 75% of cases were positive for a viral etiology, with rhinovirus being the isolate in 53% of cases. No recognizable clinical effects were observed in the severity of common cold symptoms in patients treated with fluticasone propionate when compared to placebo. Viral sinusitis was present in 57% of patients during the study period, but all resolved spontaneously. In the RV positive cases, there was a tendency for reduced incidence of sinusitis on day 7 of illness in the fluticasone group when compared to placebo (18 vs. 35%, respectively) (Puhakka et al., 1998b) . 36% of fluticasone propionate recipients had positive RV cultures on day 7 of the illness, compared to 14% in the placebo group. The statistical significance of this finding disappeared when PCR results were included in the analysis. A study of intranasal fluticasone therapy of colds in children also found higher frequencies of rhinovirus shedding and otitis media when compared to placebo.",

New influenza A (H3N2) strains with the potential to infect humans were discovered in 1998 to be widespread in swine in the US. Also, for the first time, an influenza B virus was detected in harbor seals in Europe. The human outbreak of influenza A (H5N1) virus that arose from infected birds in Hong Kong in 1997 was a clear example of a potential pandemic threat. In 1999, another new influenza A virus (H9N2) emerged in China where it caused disease in chickens; and two children in Hong Kong were discovered to be infected and ill with this virus. In addition to underscoring the need for improving and enhancing global viral surveillance, recent events have indicated a need for better training of personnel, availability of adequate laboratory facilities, and development of pandemic preparedness plans in different regions of the world. In this regard, the WHO has the roles of maintaining a global influenza surveillance network during interpandemic periods and of aiding countries in pandemic preparedness. Providing effective vaccination remains the principal intervention in a pandemic plan. However, the availability of newer antiviral agents effective against both influenza A and B (in addition to the currently available antivirals), offers the possibility of treatment of selected cases and use of short-term prophylaxis during a pandemic, particularly in regions of the world where time for development and use of vaccines will not be feasible.",

Adenoviruses are also notable as an important cause of disease that can affect many different organ systems. Viral replication in the respiratory tract results in the stimulation of multiple pathways for inflammation including cytokines and inflammatory mediators that lead to mucocilliary damage, dysfunction, and clinical symptoms. The use of combination anti-inflammatory and antiviral (interferon) therapy was of benefit in treatment of rhinovirus common colds. No benefit has been demonstrated with the use of steroids in viral respiratory illnesses, other than for croup in children. Pleconaril, a compound inhibiting receptor binding of picornaviruses, was beneficial in the treatment of acute rhinovirus infections in adults and adolescents and in experimental respiratory Coxsackie virus A21 infection in volunteers.

They reduce the severity and duration of symptoms of influenza when administered within the first 2 days after illness onset. They are safe and generally well tolerated and the development of resistance is infrequent. Resistant viruses occur late in about 1% of infected subjects by either a mutation in the binding site of NA or a mutation in the HA that reduces binding affinity and the need for NA activity. Alternatively, resistance may be seen where the balance of HA binding affinity and NA eluting activity of viruses without mutations is such that sufficient NA activity remains in the presence of drug. So far, no clinical deterioration has been associated with the development of resistance, and resistant viruses appear to be less virulent in animal models.",
