Continuing investigation into the seroepizootiology of FIPV has raised more questions than have been answered.

From these observations, it was proposed that the development of clinical FIP might depend on an intrinsic susceptibility of the intestinal or respiratory tract epithelium to infection. Subsequent dissemination of virus and the development of clinical signs might further be dependent on an immune response that was nonprotective. 23 Both the strain of FIPV and challenge dose of virus contacted by the susceptible cat may be critical at this point. With larger doses of virus, more cats become infected and the ratio of diseased to asymptomatic cats increases. 20 Following aerosol exposure, initial localization and replication of virus beyond the epithelium occurs in large mononuclear cells in regional lymphoreticular tissue or in subepithelial layers. The initial target cells for FIPV may be the dendritic macrophage, located in the cortex of lymph nodes. 32 One can speculate that similar internalization of virus might occur through the intestinal epithelium follOwing oral exposure.",

Coagulopathies have been noted in naturally occurring cases of the disease. 5 Thrombosis and blood stasis in small veins may enhance seeding of virus and dissemination through vessel walls at these sites. 30 Role of Sensitizing Antibody in FIP As noted previously, antibody cross-reacting with FIPV influences both the outcome of infection and the course of disease. When compared to seronegative kittens, experimental infection of coronaviral antibody-positive kittens results in the following; 1. Tendency for dissemination and fibrinous serositis, rather than localization to the intestinal epithelium. B 2. Earlier onset of cell-associated viremia. 31 3. Shorter incubation period, with earlier onset of clinical signs. 22 4. Earlier onset of hematologic abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. 31 5. More fulminating clinical signs with decreased survival times . lB. 22. 3031 Seronegative kittens failed to show clinical signs until seroconversion occurred. 33 Similarly, seronegative kittens passively immunized with feline serum containing high-titered antibodies reactive with FIPV developed a more fulminating clinical disease after FIPV challenge than did those pretreated with FIPV negative serum. 33 The immunopathogenesis of FIP has been compared with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) of man. 33 An arboviral infection mainly affecting children in tropical climates, DHF is transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Affected individuals develop an abrupt onset of constitutional signs, followed in about 50 per cent of cases by hemorrhagic manifestations.",

Changes in the anterior chamber include corneal edema, aqueous Hare, hypotony, iritis (Fig. 5A) , hyphema, hypopyon (Fig. 5A) , and keratic precipitates (Fig. 5B) . 13, 15, 20 On fundic examination, Hame-or boat-shaped retinal hemorrhages may be evident. Engorgement of retinal veins and perivascular cuffing is often seen (Fig. 6) . Choroidal inHammation may cause subretinal Huid exudation and secondary bullous or linear retinal detachments. 13 Histopathologic changes are found primarily in the iris, ciliary body, choroid, and retina. 13 Neurologic Manifestations of FIP The central nervous system manifestations of non effusive FIP have recently been reviewed. 4 \u2022 20 Presenting signs are variable and include progressive incoordination, posterior paresis, nystagmus, convulsions, intention tremors, cranial and peripheral nerve paralysis, hyperesthesia, generalized ataxia, head tilt, behavioral changes, and urinary incontinence. Posterior paresis, convulsions, and nystagmus were the most frequent signs observed in one series. 14 Pathologic changes are typically multifocal or diffuse and surfaceoriented, affecting primarily the choroid plexus, meninges (Fig. 7) , and ependyma. These regions of the central nervous system may be prone to immune complex and/or cell-mediated injury.4 Gelatinous masses of fibrinous exudate may obstruct the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in hydrocephalus. Histologically, lesions are characterized as a pyogranulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis. Lesions, as expected, are often oriented around small blood vessels, especially venules. 4 Many cats with noneffusive FIP that are not manifesting overt neurologic signs have histopathologic evidence of central nervous system involvement. 14 Accurate management of cats with suspected FIP requires careful correlation of physical findings, laboratory results, and coronaviral serology. It is beyond the scope of this article to review the laboratory diagnosis of FIP, and the reader is referred elsewhere for this information. 5 , 20, 26 Overreliance and misinterpretation of coronaviral antibody titers have caused FIP to become the most overdiagnosed feline disease. The article \"Serodiagnostic Aids and Management Practice for Feline Retrovirus and Coronavirus Infections\" deals specifically with the limitations of this diagnostic test.",
