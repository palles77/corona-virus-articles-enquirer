However, the study performed cultures on only a small number of dogs and in general, blood culture is considered relatively insensitive for diagnosing bacteremia. 34, 35 The IME value for systemic infections inducing IMHA in these studies ranged from 0.00 33 to 4.20. 24 Sepsis with concurrent IMHA was reported in 3/93 (3.2%) dogs in one study, 10 yielding an IME value for sepsis of 1.87. Outcome information for these patients was not given, and there was no direct evidence for sepsis causing IMHA.",

Consensus Summary Statement: The evidence for systemic or localized bacterial infections inducing IMHA was negligible. However, the reports of bacterial infection and concurrent IMHA have largely been limited to case reports or other studies that were not designed to determine whether bacterial infection is a cause of IMHA in dogs.

Consensus Summary Statement: The overall evidence that Ehrlichia induces IMHA is negligible. However, a role for ehrlichiosis in canine IMHA cannot be ruled out. Further prospective, controlled studies are needed to determine if Ehrlichia spp. can induce IMHA in individual patients. Three studies that documented infection with hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. in 3 individual dogs with IMHA met inclusion criteria for this review. One study identified a dog infected with M. haemocanis and another identified a dog infected with Ca. M. haematoparvum. IME values for these two studies were 2.87 and 1.70 respectively.",
