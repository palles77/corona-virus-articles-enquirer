            "text": "The pathogenesis of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is complex and unclearly defined, and in particular, the effects of the JEV receptor (JEVR) on diverse susceptible cells are elusive. In contrast to previous studies investigating JEVR in rodent or mosquito cells, in this study, we used primate Vero cells instead. We noted that few novel proteins co-immunoprecipitated with JEV, and discovered that one of these was heat shock protein 90\u03b2 (HSP90\u03b2), which was probed by mass spectrometry with the highest score of 60.3 after questing the monkey and human protein databases. The specific HSP90\u03b2-JEV binding was confirmed by western blot analysis under non-reducing conditions, and this was significantly inhibited by an anti-human HSP90\u03b2 monoclonal antibody in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry. In addition, the results of confocal laser scanning microscopic examination demonstrated that the HSP90\u03b2-JEV binding occurred on the Vero cell surface. Finally, JEV progeny yields determined by plaque assay were also markedly decreased in siRNA-treated",

It is prevalent throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and has expanded onto the Cape York Peninsula of Northern Australia (2) (3) (4) ; it has affected approximately 60% of the global population in endemic countries at risk of exposure to JEV. JE primarily occurs in children under 15 years of age and the elderly when protective immunity decreases (2, 5) . Fortunately, most JEV infections are subclinical with a symptomatic-to-asymptomatic ratio of 1:25-1,000 (6, 7) . With thebroad administration of inactivated and attenuated live vaccines, the annual JE incidence is estimated to range from 50,000-175,000 cases. Approximately 20-30% of cases are fatal, and approximately 30-50% of survivors suffer serious neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric complications several years thereafter (8) (9) (10) . Therefore, JE remains a significant health threat to the public worldwide.",

The E protein consists of 500 amino acid residues, appears as approximately 53 kDa, and is N-glycosylated (14) . An exact crystal structure of the JEV E protein ectodomain was previously produced and the major conformational properties previously suggested were confirmed based on a related flavivirus [tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV)] E protein counterpart (15, 16) . In brief, the E protein is present on the virion surface as an anti-parallel homodimer with a convex external curvature and is anchored to the viral envelope (lipid membrane) at the distal end. Each E protein subunit is composed of 3 domains based on antigenicity (13) . Domain I is a discontinuous domain composed of 3 fragments (1-51, 137-189 and 293-311 amino acids from the amino terminal end) and is the central domain with an 8-stranded \u03b2-barrel located in the centre of the E protein molecule. Domain II is the dimerization domain on the mature virion, forms 2 loops from regions 52-136 and 190-289, projects along the virus surface between the homodimer subunit transmembrane regions, and contains a highly conserved fusion loop that likely inserts into target cell membranes (17) . Domain III (311-411) lies at the E protein C-terminus, forms a constant \u03b2-barrel composed of 7 head-to-tail \u03b2-strands, and maintains an immunoglobulin-like fold (18) . It contains the receptor-binding domain, which is connected to the central domain I by a flexible region and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies (19) .",

Therefore, determining the cellular receptor is a prerequisite for future investigations into precise molecular events involved in JEV binding and entry into cells, which has always been an intriguing basic virology field. Research has advanced over the past few decades. Early in 1994, researchers discovered that a 74 kDa molecule from Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells can bind JEV without further characterization (20) . Later, researchers found that a 57 kDa protein from BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) cells (21) and a GAG protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (22) may be involved in JEV attachment or entry. In previous studies from our laboratory, we generated several pieces of evidence and, thus, hypothesised that heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) may act as a JEV binding receptor on mosquito C6/36 cells (23) . It has been reported that heat shock protein (HSP)70, which is present in the membrane fraction from mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro2a), is the putative receptor for JEV (24) . In addition, using a mouse microglial cell line, researchers have demonstrated that the extracellular matrix protein, laminin, and several other candidate receptor molecules, including HSP70, HSP90, GRP78, CD14 and CD4, are involved in JEV entry (25) . Nevertheless, these studies are limited to rodent or mosquito cells, and the interacting cellular proteins from human or at least primate cells are necessary to elucidate the functional role of E protein with interacting cellular proteins. Herein, we discovered that HSP90\u03b2 in the monkey cell (Vero) membrane binds JEV particles.",

Moreover, the percentages of HSP90\u03b2-JEV binding measured by FCM also significantly decreased (P<0.01) from 76.17\u00b10.69% (0 \u00b5g/ml anti-HSP90\u03b2 m Ab) to 19.15\u00b10.35% (20 \u00b5g/ml anti-HSP90\u03b2 mAb) and further to 10.43\u00b10.53% (100 \u00b5g/ml anti-HSP90\u03b2 mAb) compared with the negative controls of 1.70\u00b10.11% ( Fig. 3B and C) . These results clearly demonstrated that a specific anti-HSP90\u03b2 mAb inhibited HSP90\u03b2-JEV binding in a dose-dependent manner.",

Subsequent sequencing data revealed that the 21-nt siRNA (GGAUGACA GCGGUAAGGAUtt) was complementary to the human HSP90\u03b2 mRNA 1012-1030 nt (GGATGACAGTGGTAA GGATAA), which is consistent with a previous report (31) . Overall, the progeny virions in both intact and siRNA-treated Vero cell culture supernatants were detected at 24 (Fig. 4B ), 36 and 48 hpi. The commensurate numbers of viral plaques at 36 and 48 hpi in the intact cells indicated that fewer infectious viruses were released, implicating that almost all cells became infected after 36 hpi when the MOI was 0.1. However, in the siRNA-treated cells, the virion yields were significantly inhibited (P<0.01), particularly at 24 and 36 hpi, by 6.5-and 5.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 4C ).",

In a VOPBA, cell membrane protein extracts from virus-susceptible cells are first subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, then incubated with virions or VAPs, and, finally, the specific virus-binding protein is indicated by specific enzyme-conjugated mAbs against the virus. However, VOPBA results cannot distinguish the virus-binding protein but only its size (molecular weight) (33, 34) . For a successful VOPBA experiment, a single polypeptide must exhibit the tentative receptor activity, bind viruses without other membrane components and maintain binding activity in electrophoresis detergents (32) . As it failed in a previous trial of VOPBA on BHK-21 cells in our laboratory, we used a Co-IP assay (35) instead to identify the JEV-binding protein with the advantage of a direct virus-membrane protein interaction under conditions that mimic physiological conditions and more natural conformations to enhance the certainty of protein binding. Due to the possible involvement of third party proteins unrelated to JEV binding in the immunoprecipitates, MS was necessarily introduced to probe the proteins in the precipitates and provide clues to the candidate JEV receptor (JEVR) protein(s) for further verification.",

The MS results (Table I) suggested that novel proteins at approximately 95, 43 and 34 kDa are unnamed or hypothetical proteins (scores over 30) based on a monkey protein database (genus Macaca). Due to high genetic homogeneity between monkeys and humans, the human protein database (Homo sapiens) was quested, and the results revealed that the proteins were HSP90\u03b2, an unnamed protein, the three-dimensional structure of glutathione s-transferase, and aconitase 2 precursor. Possessing the highest score of 60.3 among the four candidates, HSP90\u03b2 is an entire, functional protein and was then selected for further investigation, though it is generally considered to be a cytoplasmic protein. Considering the inefficient separation of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions during the cell membrane protein extraction procedures, it was not surprising to discover that a few hydrophilic proteins may be present in the hydrophobic fraction. However, the hydrophobic proteins remained dominant in this fraction. This finding is similar to our previous results when using BHK-21 membrane proteins (36) .",

As their name implies, HSPs protect cells through increased expression from 1 to 2% of the total proteins in unstressed cells to 4-6% in stressed cells upon stimulation by elevated temperatures (38, and refs therein) . HSP90 is one such heat-related chaperone protein and the '90' indicates that it weighs approximately 90 kDa. It is found in bacteria and all eukaryotes, but is absent in archaea (39) , and its cytoplasmic counterpart is essential for cell viability under all conditions in eukaryotes (40) . Mammalian cells feature several HSP90 isoform homologues (such as \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b2), which are defined by their different coding genes (HSP90AA1, HSP90AA2 and HSP90AB1), subcellular locations (cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria) (41) , or extracellular presence (42) . Human HSP90\u03b1 is inducible, mostly forms anti-parallel homodimers, and is 85% identical to the HSP90\u03b2 amino acid sequence, which is otherwise described as constitutive and a monomer due to several single amino acid mutations in the C-terminal dimerization domain (43) (44) (45) .",

            "text": "Using western blot analysis, we only produced positive results under non-reducing and non-boiled conditions, which is in contrast to the routine reducing method (data not shown). The novel band at approximately 95 kDa from the cell membrane protein extracts was reacted solely with either anti-human HSP90\u03b2 mAb recognizing the amino acid sequences 1-100 that correspond to the human HSP90\u03b2 N-terminus (see mAb manufacturer's fact sheet; http://www. abcam.com/hsp90-beta-antibody-e296-ab32568.html) or anti-JEV mAb against E protein at the same position around 90 kDa (Fig. 2A) . These data suggest that the HSP90\u03b2-JEV complex formed as it was recognised by two different mAbs against the two respective complex components. In addition, the non-reducing and non-boiled conditions imply that the JEV binding activity of HSP90\u03b2 may depend on the proper conformation of its monomers, which is sensitive to the detergents used in electrophoresis. This conformational requirement may partially explain why the VOPBA produced good results for the similar single peptide chain HSP70 (24,54), but did not demonstrate why HSP90\u03b2, which is broadly expressed in mouse brain cells (55), did not bind JEV on Neuro2A cells (24) . For mouse microglial (BV-2) cells, HSP family members, including HSP70, HSP90 and GRP78, are also involved in JEV entry, but play a minor role in virus internalization, which is in contrast to CD4 with a major entry role (25) . Furthermore, the confocal laser scanning microscopic examination demonstrated that HSP90\u03b2 and JEV co-localised along the Vero cell surface (Fig. 2B) , though HSP90\u03b2 is generally defined as a cytosolic protein.",

In the IFA experiment, the HSP90\u03b2-JEV binding clearly decreased with the increasing anti-HSP90\u03b2 mAb concentrations, and the binding percentages quantified by FCM also exhibited a significant decrease (P<0.01) from 76.17\u00b10.69% (0 \u00b5g/ml anti-HSP90\u03b2 mAb) to 19.15\u00b10.35% (20 \u00b5g/ml anti-HSP90\u03b2 mAb) and further to 10.43\u00b10.53% (100 \u00b5g/ml anti-HSP90\u03b2 mAb) compared with the negative control of 1.70\u00b10.11% (Fig. 3B) . These results clearly demonstrate that the specific anti-HSP90\u03b2 mAb inhibited HSP90\u03b2-JEV binding in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, it is reasonable to presume that the JEV-binding domain of HSP90\u03b2 is located at the N-terminus, which is recognised by the anti-HSP90\u03b2 mAb.",

Several siRNA fragments directed to the human HSP90\u03b2 mRNA sequence were synthesised and transfected into Vero cells via lentiviral vectors. We only selected out one transfected cell line with over 50% steady inhibition of HSP90\u03b2 expression (Fig. 4A) , whose siRNA sequence is identical to an effective one reported earlier that corresponds to human HSP90\u03b2 nt 1012-1030 (31) .

This is in contrast to the aforementioned reports, which indicate that HSP70 family members are putative JEVR, HSP70 and its counterparts do not react to JEV in Vero cells. Furthermore, JEV seemed to prefer binding larger HSPs from HSC70 in mosquito cells to HSP90 in primate cells. In other words, these high molecular weight HSPs preserve the conservative conformation that distinctly fits JEV, and shifts from HSC70, HSP70 and then to HSP90 over millions years of evolution. To better support this presumption, more information pertaining JEV binding molecules on human susceptible cells is necessarily needed.",
