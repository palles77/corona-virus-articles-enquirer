The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between serum regulatory cytokines concentrations and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. Methods: We enrolled 325 children aged < 24 months who were diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infection. Twenty age-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed to identify virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and blood samples were taken to quantify the regulatory cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL)-35, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 using the Bio-Plex immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: RSV disease was associated with a great regulatory cytokine response than healthy children, among 89 RSV-infected patients, serum IL-35 (P = .0001) and IL-10 (P = .006) was significantly elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Young children (0 < age \u22646 months) with RSV infection had significantly lower IL-35 and IL-10 expression but needed more oxygen therapy and more severe disease comparing with older children (12 < age < 24 months). Comparing with mild group, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease (P = .012 and P = .005, respectively). And levels of IL-10 was inversely associated with total duration of RSV infection symptoms (r = \u2212 0.311, P = .019). Conclusion: Children with RSV infected had increased serum regulatory cytokine IL-10 and IL-35 concentrations. Elevated expression of IL-10 and IL-35 were contributed to protect hypoxia and reduce the severity of disease.",

Th2 cytokine responses are predominant in infants with RSV infection [9] , and contribute to the pathogenesis of severe RSV disease, such as increased interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13 [3] . Some studies have indicated that Th1 cytokine responses such as interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 decrease with severe RSV disease in infants [10, 11] .

            "text": "The presence of precise combinations of cytokines can effectively regulate the development of polarized Th cell responses mounted in response to viral infections. It has been shown that IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-\u03b2 were defined as regulatory cytokine due to the immunosuppressive roles in viral infections and autoimmunity disease [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . For example, IL-10 inhibits acute inflammation and mitigates progression of an imbalanced Th1/Th2 response triggered by RSV infection [8, 18, 19] . IL-35 has recently been identified as a suppressive cytokine that contributes to the induction of type 1 regulatory T cells and modulates IL-10 production [12, 20] . TGF-\u03b2 is another immunosuppressive cytokine that interferes with the production of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 in response to RSV infection [21] . All these data indicated that protective immune responses are regulated by regulatory cytokines and depend on the infectious agent. Conversely, other researches have demonstrated the IL-10 also induced strong Th2-dominant immune response and enhanced the RSV disease [19] . To evaluate the role of regulatory cytokines in RSV disease, we characterized changes in the expression levels of several regulatory cytokines including IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-\u03b21 in the context of RSV infection in pediatric patients, and characterized the role in response to RSV infection.",

Healthy controls consisted of children who met the following criteria: (i) age < 2 years old who before underwent surgery in the surgical department; (ii) without current and recent clinical symptoms of respiratory infection (i.e., cough, fever, wheezing, expectoration, anhelation, etc); (iii) without history of other system infection. Children with premature birth (< 37 weeks), underlying chronic diseases (e.g., chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or immunodeficiency), immune disease, asthma, or combined with other infection were excluded. When eligible children visited the hospital, a nasopharyngeal swab and blood were taken within 24 h of enrollment and tested for the presence of RSV and levels of cytokines.

We compared the levels of IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-\u03b21 in patients in different age groups (Table 3 ). Our data show that the expression levels of IL-10 and IL-35 were significantly lower in children 0 < age \u22646 months than 12 < age < 24 months (P = .043 and P = .029, respectively). No changes in the levels of serum TGF-\u03b21 were observed in any group. To exclude the influence of increasing age on the level of cytokines, we analyzed the correlation between age and cytokine levels in RSV-infected patients and healthy controls (data not shown). These results did not show any correlation between age and the levels of IL-10, IL-35 or TGF-\u03b21 in the two groups. The impact that cytokine levels have on the severity of disease were investigated (Fig. 2) . Comparing with mild group, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease (P = .012 and P = .005, respectively). We also investigated the correlation between the level of the cytokines (IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-\u03b21) with the total duration of symptoms. We found that the concentrations of IL-10 was inversely correlated with the total duration of symptoms (r = \u22120.311, P = .091) ( Table 4 ). Similar differences and associations for the levels of IL-35 and TGF-\u03b21 were not observed. To evaluate the relation between viral infection and the cytokine responses, we also analyzed correlations among the RSV load, cytokine concentrations and WBCs, but we have not found any correlation among these parameters.",

IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-\u03b2 were generated in periphery from regulate T cells and mediated immunosuppression. IL-35 is produced by CD4 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cells and IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 are mainly generated in the periphery from conventional CD4 + FoxP3 \u2212 induced Treg cells [19, 27] . Previous studies have demonstrated how immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-35 inhibit acute inflammation and regulate the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses [8, 18, 19, 27, 28] . Induced IL-10 and IL-35 expression could benefit the host response to limit the exaggerated inflammatory response to RSV infection, such as Th1/Th2 cytokine responses. Although TGF-\u03b21 possesses anti-inflammatory properties with the potential of inhibiting both Th1 and Th2 responses elicited in response to bacterial and viral infection [29] [30] [31] , we did not find that TGF-\u03b21 expression profiles differed between RSV-infected patients and healthy controls.",

            "text": "IL-10 is a multifunctional cytokine. Some studies have demonstrated that IL-10 produced by effector T cells and monocytes played a pivotal role in controlling disease severity by suppressing the production of Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2) [18, 32] . In addition, IL-10 also can suppress Th2 cell generation and further suppress airway hyper-responsiveness and tissue remodeling in RSV-infected patients [19] . But IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 and IL-10 also were excess produced by type 2 T cells, which can enhance the RSV disease [7, 33] . In this study, we found the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease and inversely associated with total duration of symptoms. These data indicate that IL-10 was plays a protective role. Lower level of IL-10 was associated with more-severe RSV disease. IL-10 producing by CD4 + FoxP3 + and CD4 + FoxP3 -T cell were plays a critical role in regulating the immune response in RSV infection by restricting T-cellmediated pulmonary inflammation and injury [34] . IL-35 has been shown to have potential suppressive activities through the expansion of Treg cells and IL-10 production to inhibit the CD4+ effector cells inducing Th1 and Th17 cells [27] . Although our results demonstrated increased expression of IL-35 in RSV-infected pediatric patients, expression levels did not correlate with the severity of disease. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the enhanced levels of IL-35 by affecting the IL-10 expression and indirectly contribute to amelioration of disease in RSV-infected patients. Novel mechanisms indicated that B lymphocytes exert a suppressive function in viral infection in an IL-10independent manner through production of IL-35 [35] . IL-10, IL-35 and from inducible T regulatory cells exhibits the potential suppressive function and plays a critical role maintaining immune balance [20] . Future studies will be required to evaluate the correlation between IL-10 and IL-35 in RSV disease.",

It is interestingly that the children less than 6months had significantly lower IL-10 and IL-35 compared to children 12 < age < 24 months old, but a correlation between age and the regulatory cytokines was not observed. As we known, the infant less than 6months has an immature immune system, including innate immune response and adaptive response, but due to the residual maternal antibody that may prevent induction of a good immune response [1, 37] . Other study had revealed that the cytokines/ chemokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 were not significantly different between the age group in children with RSV infection [38] . The results of the present study have shown that the levels of IL-10 and IL-35 were significant lower in children 0 < age \u22646 months who were more likely to need supplemental oxygen. These data indicated that IL-10 and IL-35 expression is RSV specific, and play a protective role in RSV disease. In accordance with other investigators, the study has shown that IL-10 was increased in response to RSV infection, and lower concentration of IL-10 was associated with more severe RSV disease [16, 38] . We had not found any study about IL-35 in RSV disease. Others have demonstrated that IL-10 inhibits viral replication [16] , but we had not found any relationships between IL-10 and RSV load. Disease presentation has for a long time been used as an indicator of the severity of disease resulting from RSV infection. Our results suggested that children 0 < age \u22646 months were significantly more likely to present with a longer total duration of symptoms. This observation was in agreement with previous studies demonstrating that younger children are at a greater risk of infection and more likely to develop severe disease symptoms following infection with RSV [39, 40] . Serum IL-10 level was inversely associated with total duration of symptoms. It also indicated that high IL-10 level was associated with a favorable outcome and contributed to the recovery and attenuation of disease progression in RSV-infected children.",
