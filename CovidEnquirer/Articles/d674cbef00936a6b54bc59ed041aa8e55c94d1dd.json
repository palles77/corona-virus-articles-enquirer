In this study, we demonstrated that the non-structural protein NS3 of HCV enhances cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene promoter activity, COX-2 mRNA expression, COX-2 protein production, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release in HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent fashion. We also showed that transcription factor NF-\u03baB is required for the activation of COX-2 regulated by NS3. In addition, multiple signaling pathways are involved cooperatively in the expression of COX-2 activated by the viral protein in a calcium-independent manner, which requires signaling components including JNK, ERK, and PKD2. A thorough investigation of mechanism involved in the activation of COX-2 regulated by HCV would provide insights into our understanding the processes of liver inflammatory response and hepatocellular carcinoma development caused by the viral infection and also into the development of novel therapeutics against HCV infection.",

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was cloned into BamHI and EcoRI sites of pCMV-tag2B to generate plasmid pCMV-NS3, in which NS3 protein was tagged by FLAG. The resulting construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutants of ERK1 and ERK2 were gifts from Dr. Cobb (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) and a mutant of JNK was a gift from Dr. Karin (University of California at San Diego, San Diego, CA, USA). PKC siRNA vectors were constructed by ligating the corresponding pairs of oligonucleotide to pSilencer 2.0 (Ambion, Inc., Augustin, TX, USA) based on the sequences described previously (Storz et al., 2004) .",
