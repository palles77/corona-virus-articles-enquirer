The intrinsic ability of microarrays to perform multiplexed, low-volume and sensitive biological assays in a highly scalable manner is a significant advantage in biological threat analysis [4] . Developed in the early to mid 1990s, DNA microarrays stirred a technological revolution that continues to propel genomics research today [5] . Applications included the identification and comparison of mRNA or DNA from across tissues or organisms by hybridization against thousands of oligomeric DNA probes immobilized on planar surfaces, such as glass slides (Figure 1 ). This provided researchers with an unprecedented ability to quantify genome-wide differences in gene expression or sequence changes using minimal amounts of sample. In the context of biodefence, these studies have dramatically extended our capability beyond merely detecting known pathogens; now we are able to rapidly profile and characterize pathogens, as well as identify novel strains or 'genetic islands' that manifest changes in virulence (or the evolution of resistance). Such comparative phylogenomic profiling using microarrays facilitates the understanding of pathogen diversification by providing a bird's-eye view of the gene content present or absent within a given microbial genome [6] .",

DNA-based detection systems generally rely on the ability of PCR to amplify and fluorescently tag the tiny amounts of target DNA present in the specimen. Advances in miniaturizing this initial PCR step, for instance the development of Review Glossary Biodefence: defensive measures against biological threats, including natural/ emerging pathogens and bioterror agents, that have significant potential to endanger public health Detection: identifying the presence of target pathogen(s) from clinical or environmental samples. Diagnostics: tests used to detect a medical condition, for example to test for the causative pathogen responsible for an infection. Sandwich immunoassay: a biochemical assay for detecting the presence and/ or abundance of a target substance using the antibody-antigen reaction. Two antibodies are used; the first is immobilized and the other, free antibody carries a reporter group, thereby providing a positive readout when the target is recognized and 'sandwiched' between the two antibodies. Sensitivity: probability of a positive result when the pathogen is indeed present; high sensitivity is related to a low Type 2 error. Serovars: a group of microorganisms distinguished by the presence of specific surface antigens. Specificity: probability of a negative result when the pathogen is not present; high specificity is related to a low Type 1 error. Tiling arrays: tiling arrays are a type of DNA microarray in which short probe segments that have been designed to cover the entire genome are used. The extent of probe overlap will translate to the mapping resolution and might range from highly overlapped probes across each individual nucleotide base (for resequencing applications) to non-overlapping probes (for genome-wide expression analysis).

Corresponding author: Uttamchandani, M. (mahesh@dso.org.sg). micro-PCR (mPCR), followed by hybridization and identification against probes on DNA microarrays have spun-off viable chip-based platforms that are able to successfully perform biological threat detection and analysis. Such portable systems, as will be described, are already appearing on the market and competing to attract lucrative biodefence funding. Alternative detection platforms have exploited quantitative PCR in 'fieldable' real-time detectors, where positive PCR amplification would indicate the presence of the corresponding target DNA [4] . These have included devices such as GeneXpert (Cepheid), Rapid (Idaho Technologies) or BioSeeq (Smiths Detection), but these systems provide relatively limited throughput [7] . Microarray systems are, by contrast, more definitive and highly scalable because hundreds to tens of thousands of possible DNA elements can be interrogated in a single experiment. Their performance nevertheless hinges on both the adoption of robust panels of probes that can accurately identify DNA from organisms of interest and the successful extraction and amplification of pathogen DNA from the relevant clinical sample or isolates [8, 9] .",

Molecular identification using random PCR followed by multiplexed resolution over a microarray offers a particularly attractive alternative for detection and diagnostics, generating results in 2-6 h once assays are optimized ( Figure 2a ). Wang et al. [18] developed such a microarray approach for the screening of viral pathogens from across broad viral families. A randomized primer was used to amplify any viral RNA that was present in the sample using reverse transcriptase-PCR followed by hybridization on a microarray comprising 1600 70-mer probes, representing nearly 140 virus genomes. Degeneracy of probes on the microarray and cross-hybridization of certain viruses across expected patterns indicated the emergence of novel, uncharacterized strains, which could hence be identified with the aid of microarrays. Similarly, Sengupta and colleagues [19] developed microarrays with 476 probes to distinguish among various influenza viruses. Primers were designed against characteristic sequences specific to influenza that targeted the viral fusion protein haemagglutinin and the glycosidase neuraminidase segments. Using the Affymetrix respiratory pathogen microarray, Lin et al. [20] detected the respiratory viruses influenza A and adenovirus, which were then further differentiated according to strain and species. This setup made use of a so-called 'resequencing' microarray that contained one perfectly matched and three mismatched probes per base and thus was able to identify genetic mutations at the sequence level [20] . The array's large screening capacity meant that both the forward and reverse strands of the DNA targets could be sequenced to provide added sequencing accuracy. Pooled primer pairs have also been optimized for use in detecting both DNA and RNA targets for pathogens that cause upper respiratory tract infections, including viruses (influenza, corona viruses and others) and bacteria (Bordetella pertusis, Streptococcus pyogenes and others) [21] .",

Subsequent resequencing using microarrays would only take several days. Early experiments on resequencing arrays showed high rates of false discovery of up to 12-45% [29] , but experimental improvements and the development of robust algorithms, such as the ABACUS (adaptive background genotype calling scheme) software package [30] , have now greatly improved sequencing quality.",

A total of 383 102 probes (27-mers) were designed to cover the complete 29.7 kb genome on Nimblegen microarrays [31] . Virus samples from cell cultures and patient tissues could be amplified by reverse-transcriptase PCR using optimized primers and resequenced with accuracy greater than 99.99%. The platform was used to confirm that a lone case of a SARS virus infection of a graduate student had most likely come from a laboratory source because a unique 47-bp deletion was detected that was not present in other SARS isolates. Wang et al. [32] also developed a SARS microarray that helped to characterize a novel coronavirus variant. The microarray platform is thus ideal in virus tracking should outbreaks occur and, furthermore, is readily applicable to other pathogens Evolutionary perspectives lend unique insight into the genetic changes that result in differences in pathogenicity. Plague-causing Y. pestis is estimated to have diverged from the non-lethal Yersinia pseudotuberculosis an estimated 1500-20 000 years ago [34] . Bearing identical 16S rRNA sequences, more comprehensive genetic analysis was required to understand the differences in disease morbidity manifested by these two bacterial species, as well as in the different modes of transmission to humans: Y. pestis by flea bites and Y. pseudotuberculosis by food or water. A microarray specific for Y. pestis revealed three unique genomic islands and the inactivation of several genes, including those encoding the cell-adhesion proteins adhesin (yadA) and invasion (inv), as well as the O-antigen biosynthetic operon. These unique characteristics potentially led to Y. pestis' enhanced virulence and its adaptation from an enteric organism (Y. pseudotuberculosis) to a mammalian blood-borne pathogen [35] . Equivalent findings were reported by Hinchliffe et al. [36] using a similar Figure 2 . The use of microarrays for studying emergent pathogens, exemplified by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus and avian influenza (H5N1). Various approaches have been developed for detection and diagnostics with DNA and protein microarrays. (a) Specific DNA probes, for instance Co-V (orange) for SARS and H5 (green) for H5N1, can be used to detect the presence of pathogen DNA or RNA using PCR or reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR, thus enabling multiple pathogens to be detected simultaneously [26] . (b) Tiling arrays can be used to resequence pathogens so that any mutations in evolving pathogens can be rapidly detected and tracked. As illustrated, four probes, one for each nucleotide base, are used to determine the genotype at a given loci. A set of probes designed for an arbitrary position XYZ is shown to reveal the unknown base to be adenine (A). Multiple probe sets are 'tiled' across the whole pathogen genome and, upon hybridization and analysis, can confer the complete sequence information of the pathogen with great accuracy [17, 23, 25] . (c) Antibody arrays make use of the sandwich immunoassay to screen for the presence of a pathogen. As depicted, the pathogen sample is first applied to the microarray, followed by the reporter antibody. As a result, the pathogen is sandwiched in between two antibodiesan immobilized antibody (blue) and a tagged antibody (purple) capable of reporting the presence of a pathogen on the microarray [43, 45] . (d) Proteome microarrays, which contain immobilized proteins from the target pathogen, can be screened against sera obtained from infected individuals. If the individual has been exposed to the pathogen, the sera will contain antibodies (blue) against specific antigens of the pathogens that will react with the immobilized protein and that can be detected using tagged secondary antibodies (purple) [49] . This procedure also facilitates the identification of specific immunodominant antigens present in the pathogen proteome. These proteins are considered to be largely responsible for triggering the host immune response and thus have a high potential for the development of vaccines against this particular pathogen.",

In an interesting approach to reveal molecular mechanisms for pathogenesis, Weiss and colleagues [38] developed a microarray-based negative-screening approach for Francisella and obtained surviving bacterial samples from infected mice to reveal genes responsible for bacterial survival and growth in vivo. In a related study, genome-wide microarrays also revealed loci that are only present in the highly virulent Franscicella tularensis subspecies tularensis strain [39] . These loci could be used to identify potential pathogenicity islands as well as to provide unique genetic markers that could be used for strain typing and identification. Microarrays have also been applied to distinguish among variants of influenza A that are resistant to the antiviral drug amantidine by detecting mutations in the viral ion channel M2 protein [40] . Such molecular forensics experiments using microarrays have extended our capabilities to profile new or emergent threats.

Project Silent Guardian was a 10-week trial launched by the Naval Research Laboratory during the 2005 US Presidential Inauguration [41] . The challenge was to take laboratory-based microarray technology to a production-scale system capable of operationally screening up to 300 samples per day. A custom DNA microarray was designed with the capability of detecting 20 natural (including avian flu) and biothreat agents with strain-level resolution. In total, 10 000 samples were collected and screened by civilian and military laboratory personnel within the stipulated period. The trial included blinded samples that were spiked with pathogens, which were all successfully detected. This exercise showcased the feasibility of implementing microarrays as a screening tool for EOS and demonstrated their use as a rapid and robust means of sample processing and pathogen identification. Recommendations from the study included the development of a more user-friendly system with greater automation of the steps involved. These features are being incorporated by several recently launched commercial platforms. Microarray-based platforms for biothreat screening from Akonni Biosystems (http://www.akonni. com) and Veredus Laboratories (http://www.vereduslabs. com) are now on the market for multiplexed threat detection. New advances include (i) greater integration of the sample preparation (which is considered to be one of the major bottlenecks), (ii) the use of mPCR and (iii) the development of small handheld microfluidic chips and portable readers to take microarray technology to the point-ofcare. Veredus has also recently launched an influenza test chip that enables the amplification and discrimination of influenza A and B subtypes, including avian flu (H5N1), within just two hours. This great improvement in detection time has been attributed to the mPCR step, which, through rapid thermocycling, significantly reduces the duration of PCR to under 30 min. Similar devices might be developed in the future for protein and other types of non-DNA microarrays for applications in serodiagnostics.",

However, Schreiber and colleagues [42] erased this concern by developing the first small-molecule microarray in 1999 and the first protein microarray in 2000, simultaneously demonstrating that proteins could retain their activity despite being covalently attached to glass slides. Soon afterwards, other array types were developed, such as cell arrays, carbohydrate arrays and proteome arrays. Some of these newer applications have brought vital capabilities to pathogen detection and biodefence, as will be described below.

As a next-generation tool, antibody microarrays are increasing in popularity, and not without reason, for they offer unparalleled throughput, minimal reagent consumption and sensitive detection of multiple targets simultaneously [10] . The accuracy conferred is nevertheless closely linked with the quality of Review Trends in Biotechnology Vol. 27 No.1 antibodies employed, and there are issues relating to crossreactivity and antibody availability, both of which are particularly crucial for finer and more accurate strain typing. Notwithstanding these matters, a plethora of antibody microarrays have been developed that have growing potential for clinical, biothreat and point-of-care applications (Figure 2c ). Rucker et al. [43] applied antibody microarrays for the detection of toxins with low-nanomolar sensitivities, such as anthrax lethal factor (LF, a metalloendopeptidase), protective antigen (PA) and tetanus toxins (endopeptidases), through the co-application of a competitive fluorescently-labelled toxin reporter. In this setting, the samples can be tested without the need for labelling by monitoring the depletion and competitive displacement of reporter signals generated by the labelled reporter. Thirty-five antibodies were also arrayed to subtype the 20 most common Salmonella serovars [44] , and a similar study was undertaken for Escherichia coli [45] . In an impressive demonstration of the detection throughput attainable, Huelseweh and colleagues [46] built an antibody microarray to detect several Category A and B agents simultaneously, including F. tularensis, Y. pestis, Brucella melitensis (which causes brucellosis) and B. mallei, using sandwich immunoassays (Figure 2c) .",

            "text": "Conversely, antigen microarrays have also been used to identify seropositive individuals by using the presence of defensive antibodies in the serum as a means of detecting exposure to a pathogen. Pathogen proteins are typically orthologously expressed using high-throughput cloning and expression and then affinity purified to provide protein sets. In special cases, it might be necessary to consider the post-translational modifications or the way the pathogen presents itself to the host to identify and use the correct immunogenic protein variants in serodiagnostics. It is also desirable to purify the protein and check for efficient and generally uniform immobilization on the microarrays as a quality control, especially when comparisons are made across slides. In one such example, Sundaresh et al. [47] narrowed down an initial panel of 1741 F. tularensis antigens to just the top 244 in terms of their ability to predictively discriminate seropositive sera and then used these antigens to establish a diagnostic microarray comprising whole proteins. Mezzasoma et al. [48] also developed protein microarrays for simultaneous diagnostics using parasitic and viral antigens. Zhu et al. [49] monitored the antibody profiles of SARS patients using protein microarrays containing 82 purified coronavirus proteins. Antibodies present in human serum samples were detected on the protein microarrays with fluorescently labelled goat anti-human immunoglobulins. It was found that immunoreactivity against the coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins remained high for 120-320 days post infection. This provided a means to check for exposure long after infection might have occurred. Over 400 human sera samples were screened with an accuracy of 91% in differentiating infected and normal specimens [49] . Nevertheless, caution should be applied in protein-based diagnostics because incubation periods vary greatly amongst diseases. During the incubation period, the patient might not express antibodies at detectable levels but might still be capable of spreading the infection. In the case of SARS, the incubation period (the time between exposure and onset of symptoms) has a median of 4-5 days (up to a maximum of 10 days). Antibodies might be detectable only 6-7 days after first symptoms are presented, but PCR testing might be able to pick up the virus more quickly, just 1-2 days after symptoms become apparent. It might become possible in the future to integrate DNAand protein-based microarray methods to extend the range of rapid clinical diagnostics from detection of current pathogen infections to testing for exposure long after the actual infection has occurred.",

This enabled more than 190 proteins from vaccinia virus and over 1700 proteins from F. tularensis to be expressed and profiled using microarrays [57, 58] . These arrays have also helped to identify antibodies against the vaccinia virus H3L envelope protein, which confers protection in vivo (in a mouse model) [59] . The vaccinia protein microarrays have also been used to derive antibody profiles in humans inoculated with the licenced Dryvax 1 smallpox vaccine [60] , and these profiles were found to be very similar to those induced by the attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara strain, an alternative vaccine candidate [61] . Various protein microarrays have similarly been generated for identification of the immunodominant antigens of Y. pestis [62, 63] .",

For instance, small-molecule microarrays have been applied to functionally screen anthrax LF through activity-based binding signatures against a library of 1400 immobilized peptide-hydroxamate inhibitors. Putative drug candidates were discovered that bound selectively to the anthrax LF (with a low dissociation constant, K D = 0.81 mM) and inhibited its activity in vitro [64] . Carbohydrate microarrays have also been developed to elucidate the receptor preferences of influenza viruses. Stevens and colleagues [65, 66] applied glycan arrays to establish the a2-3 and a2-6 binding selectivity of the H5 and H1 haemagglutinins, which determine influenza virulence. The selectivity was altered by specific mutations in the protein, providing a useful way of functionally monitoring viral adaptation. Non-DNA microarray formats have thus contributed unique ways in which we can explore pathogen biology and develop countermeasures in the event of an outbreak.",

Greater access to the technology, such as the increased availability of microarrays together with established array designs, is helping researchers worldwide to move more quickly towards the downstream application phase, for example to perform regional studies of endemic variants.",

The progress made in the past several years has brought microarrays to the forefront of rapid diagnostics and medical research. Further integration of upstream sample preparation with downstream data processing is expected to transform microarrays into compact, field expedient solutions for analysis and monitoring in the near future. The large assortments of biomolecules now utilized in microarrays provide novel opportunities in molecular forensics and comparative profiling, especially for the newer and less well-understood pathogens. As we equip ourselves with better capabilities and countermeasures against potential biological threats, we hope to become more agile and responsive whenever such threats emerge in the future. Microarrays have improved our confidence in this respect and will continue to play a decisive part in biodefence research and technology.",
