            "text": "Some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are prone to frequent exacerbations, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The reduction and effective treatment of exacerbations may have significant benefits. 1, 2 Previous studies have shown that patients with severe or very severe air flow limitation tend to be at high risk of exacerbations. Higher exacerbation rates are associated with a faster loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and greater worsening of overall health status. [3] [4] [5] Most exacerbations of COPD are caused by bacterial infection. Studies with conventional methods have now established that approximately 50% of exacerbations are caused by bacterial infection. Nevertheless, conventional diagnostic methods are often insufficient for etiological diagnosis, and in half of these cases the pathogen cannot be determined. 6 The use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which is a reliable molecular method for diagnosing lower respiratory tract infections, has increased in recent years. The prominent advantage of the PCR method compared with culture is that since PCR is a method that is based on replicating the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) of a very small amount of microorganisms, it does not require living organisms and therefore is not affected by the use of antibiotics. In addition, PCR is more sensitive for the detection of multiple microorganisms and delivers fast results. 6 Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacterial pathogens involved in an exacerbation. 1, 6 This poses several questions, such as is it possible that the increased frequency of exacerbations in patients with more severe air flow limitations is related to the increase in infectious origin exacerbations? Or may the isolation of the bacterial agent be related to other clinical characteristics besides FEV 1 ?",

The existence of three criteria described previously, dyspnea, sputum volume, and increase in sputum purulence, was searched in the diagnosis of acute exacerbation. 11 Patients with a history of antibiotic use in the last 10 days, accompanying bronchiectasis (verified with high-resolution computed tomography), pneumonia, immunosuppression, malignancy, and congestive heart failure were not included in the study. CAT and a pulmonary function test, which is in accordance with the American Thoracic Society, were provided to the patients. All pulmonary function tests were performed by the same technician after the administration of 400 \u00b5g salbutamol while the patient was stable. The exacerbation history was noted. The combined COPD assessment scaling was applied according to GOLD 2011 criteria. Patients were divided into four groups, GOLD A, B, C, and D. Sputum samples were taken from patients to a sterile container after rinsing the mouth and throat and were analyzed microscopically by Gram staining without waiting. Sputum samples that were observed to have fewer than ten epithelial cells and more than 25 leukocytes in each area upon 100\u00d7 magnification were included in the study as appropriate sputum samples.

However, there was no significant difference between GOLD stage and culture results of the patients. In many studies of COPD acute exacerbations, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis have been found to be predominant bacterial organisms. The degree of functional respiratory impairment in COPD patients has also been associated with the presence of different bacteria in their sputum samples during the course of an exacerbation. 3, 14 It has been shown that isolation ratios of P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, and Gram-negative bacteria coincide with common factors in patients with severe and very severe COPD. 8 In the study of Li et al, 15 S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and A. baumannii were only isolated in patients with a 50% FEV 1 value. However, S. pneumoniae was found to occur more frequently in mild and moderate COPD, and H. influenzae was found approximately equally in three groups. In the study of Eller et al, 8 a correlation between impaired lung function and bacteria isolation was obtained, and the frequency of Gram-negative organisms, including Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Enterobacteriaceae, was higher in severe and very severe patients. 16 It is well known that conventional culture tests have low sensitivity and specificity for detecting microorganisms. The selective environment of the culture prevents the growth and presence of more than one type of organism. The other disadvantages are a consequence of using different media for different organisms and needing at least 2 days for results. Molecular techniques developed recently maintain very fast and reliable identification of respiratory infections. 18, 19 DNA or RNA from a very small amount of microorganisms can be isolated by PCR methods. In contrast to culture, PCR is not dependent on viable bacteria and is a valuable tool for the patients who need antibiotics. Str\u00e5lin et al 20 found that the S. pneumoniae isolation rate increased from 14% to 28%, the H. influenzae isolation rate increased from 21% to 47%, and the binary detection rate of microorganisms increased from 3% to 18% in the study comparing bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, culture, and PCR.",

In 40 of 42 patients with positive cultures, the same microorganisms were detected by PCR. In only two samples was PCR negative. This situation can be explained by the presence of factors that may inhibit PCR in the samples (ie, blood, tissue, milk, or plant). Moreover, mixed infections, which cannot be found in culture, were detected by PCR (n=19). Mixed infection frequency was higher in GOLD stage D patients (n=8), but there was no significant difference between GOLD stage, FEV 1 , CAT scores, and PCR results. This study reveals only the relation between exacerbation frequency and bacterial isolation. Patients presenting frequent exacerbations have greater bacterial isolation, suggesting a greater degree of colonization. In fact, for many years, the existence of bacterial colonization of the airways has been known in patients with stable COPD. 21 In comparative studies with healthy control groups, colonization of H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus in the sputum 5 and protected specimen brush 22,23 samples of patients with stable COPD was present. Although the impact of colonized bacteria on an acute exacerbation has not yet been clear, it has been recently presented that an increase in bacterial load during exacerbations and proliferation of new strains has a relationship with acute exacerbations. 24, 25 When studies evaluating parameters associated with bacterial colonization are considered, Patel et al 26 observed 29 patients with COPD for 529 days and found a significant relationship between exacerbation frequency and increased colonization but did not find any relationship between airway obstruction and colonization. Similarly, Zhang et al, 5 in a study based on the observations In the present study, a relationship between exacerbation frequency and bacteria isolation was found. Hence, in terms of bacterial etiology, exacerbation frequency seems to be a better indicator compared with GOLD stage and FEV 1 .",

There may be two reasons explaining why there was no difference in group D (which had frequent exacerbations, more symptoms, and lower FEV 1 values) in terms of bacterial isolation frequency compared with other groups for patients classified according to the new GOLD staging. First, very severe patients with lung functions already at the lower limits are probably more sensitive to noninfectious agents such as air pollution and heart failure, and they show acute exacerbation symptoms more quickly. Air pollution and other environmental conditions that increase airway inflammation or bronchomotor tone may account for 15%-20% of exacerbations. 6 The very high air pollution rate in the region where the study was conducted also supports this thesis. In this way, the conditions may be synchronized with a mild period for COPD patients who are not affected easily by noninfectious causes. Second, the average FEV 1 in our study was very high (56% predicted). The average FEV 1 for D group patients was 42.3%. There may be differences in results for the severe COPD patients with lower FEV 1 values.",

Therefore, lower airway bacterial colonization seems to be more frequent for patients with frequent exacerbations. However, whether colonization causes frequent exacerbations or vice versa is not clear.3,14 In our study, PPB were isolated more frequently from patients with frequent exacerbations. Our study has not been designed for discriminating colonization or active infection. Because exacerbations were confirmed in all patients clinically, isolated PPB were considered as the cause of infection. Even if the isolated PPB reflects colonization, it can still be used as a indicator of infectious agents. This is because previous patients presenting colonization developed infections as a result of a new strain. In fact, in the Sethi et al 27 study, over a period of 56 months, sputum samples for culture were collected monthly and during exacerbations from 81 outpatients with COPD. The PPB that was isolated during the stable period versus the exacerbation period illustrates the cause of the acute exacerbations as new strains of the pathogen.",
