Al-Considering the mechanistic and structural relationships between 3CL pro and HAV 3C pro , and to a lesser extent NS3 pro , we were interested to learn that some of the compounds showed highest activity against these related enzymes. In addition to inhibiting 3CL pro with an IC 50 MAC-8120 and MAC-13985 also demonstrated interesting selectivity profiles with good activity against SARS-CoV 3CL pro (IC 50 values were 4.3 and 7 M, respectively) and no detectable inhibition of any of the other proteinases tested. These particular compounds, however, proved to be difficult in the assays of HAV 3C pro and NS3 pro due to background fluorescence, and could not be tested at concentrations greater than 5 M. Nevertheless, no detectable inhibition was seen at that concentration, indicating that an IC 50 for these molecules would necessarily be much higher.",

The protease part of any initial investigations undertaken to combat was expressed using E. coli GJ1158 [48] transformed with pT7-7 newly emerging infectious agents. derivatives [49]. E. coli strains were cultured at 37\u040aC and 250 rpm in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with the appropriate antibi-A quenched-FRET assay was developed and used otics. For expression, E. coli GJ1158 was cultured in LB broth with to evaluate the activity of 3CL pro in the presence of 100 g/mL ampicillin. 50,000 small drug-like molecules; of these compounds, 572 were shown to inhibit 3CL pro . Utilizing a Construction of Plasmids and Overexpression series of filters, this number of compounds was re-DNA was manipulated using standard protocols [50]. A vector was duced to five potent hits (IC 50 \u03ed 0.5-7 M) that repredesigned to express 3CL pro as an N-terminal, cleavable his-tagged protein. The expression vector was derived from pT7HP20, a deriva-sent novel leads. Secondary studies of these leads will tive of pT7-7[49] containing an approximately 300 bp XbaI/HindIII substrate 2-aminobenzoyl-SVTLQSG-Tyr(NO 2 )-R. The rate of enzyme activity was determined by the increase in fluorescence upon fragment from pLEHP20 [51]. A plasmid containing the coding sequence of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro was a generous gift from Genome continuous monitoring of reactions in 384-well black microplates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) (excitation wavelength \u03edSciences Centre (Vancouver, BC, Canada). The gene encoding 3CL pro was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: 330 nm, emission wavelength \u03ed 420 nm). Total assay volume was 50 L, and contained 1 M 3CL pro , 100 M peptide substrate, 4.2% SPH (5\u0408-CCCAGCTAGCGGTTTTAGGAAAATGGCATTC-3\u0408) and 3SP (5\u0408-TACGAAGCTTGTCGACTTATTGGAAGGTAACACCAGAGCA-3\u0408). dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (v/v) (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada), and 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) (Sigma), unless noted other-SPH introduces an NheI site (underlined) at the beginning of the gene and 3SP introduces a HindIII site (underlined) and a stop codon wise. Reactions were done at room temperature, and were initiated by the addition of substrate. Steady-state kinetic parameters were (boldface) at the end of the coding sequence. The PCR reaction was performed using the Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase evaluated using 16 M-1 mM substrate and 1 M 3CL pro ; these data were corrected for inner filter effect by the method of Liu et al. [31] system (Roche Applied Sciences, Laval, PQ, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions using an annealing temperature of with the use of Abz-SVRLQ to calculate correction factors. 50\u040aC. The resulting amplicon was digested with NheI and HindIII and cloned in pT7HP20 yielding the expression plasmid pT7HSP1. Primary Screening The cloned gene was sequenced using an ABI 373 Strech (Applied The screen of 3CL pro against 50,000 small molecules was fully auto-Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using Big-Dye terminators to verify its mated with the use of a SAGIAN Core System (Beckman Coulter, authenticity.

Accordingly, the oligonucleotide S3CDM (5\u0408-GAAAATGGCATT fluorescence detection; the entire system was integrated through CCCGTCAGGCAAAGTTGAAGG-3\u0408) contains the BsmI restriction SAMI (v. 3.5, Beckman Coulter). Reactions were done in duplicate, site (underlined) and the missing nucleotide (boldface). A second and contained 10 M library compounds sourced from Maybridge PCR reaction was performed using S3CDM and 3SP and Pwo DNA plc (Cornwall, UK)",
