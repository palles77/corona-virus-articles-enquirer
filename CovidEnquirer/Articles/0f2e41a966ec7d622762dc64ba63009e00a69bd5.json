These anti-SARS antibodies were discovered using a novel DNA display method, which can identify new antibodies within days. Once neutralizing antibodies were identified, a comprehensive and effective means of converting the mouse sequences to human frameworks was accomplished using HuFR TM (human framework reassembly) technology. The best variant (61G4) from this screen showed a 3.5 -4-fold improvement in neutralization of SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Finally, using a complete site-saturation mutagenesis methodology focused on the CDR (complementarity determining regions), a single point mutation (51E7) was identified that improved the 80% plaque reduction neutralization of the virus by greater than 8-fold. These discovery and evolution strategies can be applied to any emerging pathogen or toxin where a causative agent is known.",

A good example is the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus, which first appeared in the human population in late 2002 and eventually infected $8000 people with a 10% fatality rate (WHO, 2003) . Today, the avian influenza H5N1 virus poses a significant threat if effective human -human transmission develops, with the potential risk of a Spanish flu-like pandemic (Juckett, 2006; Tellier, 2006 ; Thomas and Noppenberger, 2007) . The emergence of these viruses and other biothreat agents has raised world concerns for their use in biowarfare/bioterrorism and demonstrates the vulnerability of society to biological threats.",

            "text": "Traditionally, protection from pathogens can be achieved by either active or passive immunization. Active immunization in which a vaccine is administered to elicit a protective immune response is generally the desired therapeutic goal. Unfortunately, vaccine development can be slow and expensive, and in the case of biothreat agent vaccines, often fail to have the marketability to attract commercial research and development funding. Passive immunization where specific antibodies are administered is a viable alternative and provides immediate and protective immunity (Casadevall, 2002) . In sudden and unexpected terrorist attacks, the immediacy of the protection provided from passive, protective antibodies is especially important. Because the half-life of human serum immunoglobulin is $20 days, passive immunization could provide an effective countermeasure against such biological weapons (Casadevall, 2002) . The challenge then lies in being able to rapidly respond to these biological insults with the generation of specific antibodies.",

Many organizations involved in this work either focus on the discovery of novel antibodies and subsequently, outsource necessary optimization efforts or vice versa. In contrast, we utilized technology that comprehensively encompasses both the discovery and optimization components of producing therapeutic antibodies. In addition to eliminating potential coordination issues between organizations, this centralized effort can reduce timelines. Using SARS-CoV as the model system, we have discovered, humanized, and optimized the functional performance of novel neutralizing antibodies that inhibit SARS infection in permissive cells and viral replication in vivo. These discovery and evolution strategies will potentially be useful in reducing the current susceptibility to biological threats.",

Determination of presented dose was calculated using respiratory minute volume (V m ) estimates derived by Guyton's formula (V m \u00bc 2.10 + W b 0.75 where W b is body weight). Presented dose was calculated by multiplying the total volume (V t ) of experimental atmosphere inhaled",

To limit the size of the screen, it was divided into two parts with the heavy chain library screened first followed by the light chain library. The first screen used eight fixed light chains composed of the three CDRs of the mouse variable region (4049Fab14) together with consensus sequences from the selected pools of the four defined framework families in the variable region. These eight light chains were each paired with a heavy chain library composed of 176 unique variants arrayed in duplicate on four 96-well plates (88 clones per plate) for a total of 32 '96-well plates' (1408 clones). The supernatants derived from the transfected framework library were assayed both for functional activity (i.e. reactivity to the SARS spike protein) and for relative antibody expression levels (i.e. production of sufficient antibody). From this initial screen, 176 unique hits (12.5%) were chosen that had a specific activity of 0.7 or greater when normalized to the mouse-human chimera (i.e. 4049Fab14). Following confirmation of the hits (assayed in duplicate) using the same two ELISA assays, the top 10 performers were chosen based on normalized specific activity (i.e. the degree of binding activity to the purified spike protein normalized to IgG concentration and further normalized to the specific activity of the original mouse-human chimeric antibody). The 10 best performers had specific activities ranging from 0.9 to 1.381 (Fig. 4) . The second screen consisted of these 10 heavy chain candidates paired with the light chain library composed of 176 variants arrayed in duplicate on four 96-well plates for a total of 40 '96-well plates' (1760 clones). From this initial screen, 352 hits ($20%) were chosen with a specific activity .1.1 when compared to the original 4049Fab14 antibody. These hits derived from the primary screen were assayed again in duplicate using the same ELISA assays. The top 10 performers from this secondary screen exhibited specific activities ranging around 1.5-2-fold (with a high of 2.8 and a low of 1.12) greater than the mouse -human chimera (Fig. 4) . These high and low values were chosen due to the very high level of expression (1.12 value) and very low expression but relatively high functional activity (2.8 value).

As with other display technologies, this method bypasses the laborious task of hybridoma production and perhaps more importantly, allows access to the total diversity of antibodies found within the mice. In fact, as all heavy chains have the chance to interact with all light chains, this method can provide even greater diversity than found in mice. After screening an immunized mouse library for antibodies against the spike protein, three antibodies were isolated that inhibited infection of SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. This library was recovered from three immunized mice that had been paired with three additional mice immunized with the same virus on the same schedule. The other three mice had significantly higher serum antibody titers against SARS-CoV and were used to generate antibodies following the traditional hybridoma approach. Although the analysis of the hybridomas was conducted solely with the SARS virus rather than with the spike protein alone, it is interesting to note that no neutralizing Discovery and optimization of therapeutic antibodies antibodies were found using the hybridoma approach (data not shown) while multiple neutralizing antibodies were found using DNA display. There are many protein display systems described in the literature, generally falling into three categories: viral display, cell surface display and DNA/RNA display (Li, 2000) . Phage-based systems are among the more commonly used methods, typically based on fusion of the protein of interest to a coat protein expressed on the phage surface. Despite significant successes, there are some limitations to this approach. For example, fusion to phage proteins or other aspects of phage display may interfere with the binding properties of the protein of interest. As well, multi-subunit proteins are more difficult to screen by phage display. Finally, phage display proteins are transported to the cell surface, where the in vitro environment might not be suitable for some protein -protein interactions. For ribosome display, the limitation is that proteins are made entirely in vitro, and thus might not have the right chaperones, necessary cofactors, or appropriate redox state to fold properly.",

            "text": "The DNA display method described here combines the in vivo production of proteins and an in vitro screen for desired protein characteristics. The in vitro screen allows for a highthroughput analysis of complex libraries with great diversity. For in vivo production, we made functional Fabs in specific E. coli redox strains that allowed the proper intracellular environment for Fab production at sufficient concentrations to perform a screen. The Fab was produced as a fusion of a zinc finger to the Fab heavy chain. The opposite construction with the light chain fused to the zinc finger resulted in a lower level of enrichment (data not shown). The heavy chain alone is known to be insoluble (Davies and Riechmann, 1994) and thus, we postulate that the fusion with the zinc finger, in combination with the proper oxidizing environment, could make the heavy chain soluble long enough to pair with the light chain (the light/heavy chain binding results in a soluble Fab). Due to the intracellular production of the targeted protein during DNA display, broad applications for a variety of protein-based interactions are possible. One could use the method to probe any protein -protein or protein -nucleic acid interactions in vivo, unlike a phage display screen. As well, because the proteins are produced in vivo, they could have access to chaperones that allow proper folding. Furthermore, DNA display is simpler than phage display in that there is no need to make a phage preparation and the entire library can be screened in about half the time ($1.5 days compared to three days).",

To reduce undesired immunogenicity, it is now relatively common to exchange the mouse FRs with corresponding regions of human antibodies, in essence 'humanizing' the antibody (Clark, 2000) . Several strategies for humanizing have been developed and implemented. In an approach called 'CDR grafting' the nonhuman CDRs are grafted onto a given human sequence. The human sequence is selected either by the similarity of its framework sequences with the mouse frameworks or by the similarity of its CDRs with the mouse's (Hwang et al., 2005) . Unfortunately, both approaches do not guarantee that the CDRs are presented in the same conformation as in the WT antibody. As a consequence, a significant drop in affinity is often observed (Hwang et al., 2005) . The necessity to identify and back-mutate crucial parental framework residues in the humanized antibody by computer modeling is difficult and often empirical.",

The framework library sequences were designed such that the same set of sequences can be used to ligate to the CDR regions of any antibody in which humanization is desired. A similar method to HuFR TM called framework shuffling has recently been described by Dall'Aqua et al. (2005) . In this method, framework shuffling uses sequences derived from germline sequences and the CDRs are linked by PCR. The significant disadvantage to this approach is that for each antibody, a whole new set of PCR primers needs to be designed.",

In contrast to the other random approaches such as error-prone PCR, chemical mutagenesis, and site-directed mutagenesis by sequence overlap extension PCR, GSSM TM is comprehensive and thus allows access to substitutions missed by these other methods. Using this method for an enzymatic protein, it was observed that the thermostability of a haloalkane dehalogenase was increased by 30 000-fold when combining eight single-point mutations discovered by GSSM TM (Gray et al., 2001) . Of the eight mutations, three required multiple base pair changes at each codon, thus the chance of finding these mutations using error-prone PCR would be exceedingly rare (Kretz et al., 2004) . Similarly, for the optimized antibodies presented here, three of the five amino acid positions incorporated into the reassembly screen required multiple base pair changes at each position (Table II) . In this study, the best single point mutation (i.e. 51E7) resulted in .8-fold improvement in functional activity of the antibody.

Statistical analysis at the approximate WT antibody concentration for 80% neutralization (0.78 mg/ml) indicates better neutralization (i.e. fewer plaques) for 61G4 (P , 0.04). Duplicates of each variant were assayed in the ELISA and PRNT experiments.",
