About 20% of gravid women complain of rhinitis symptoms, now attributed at least partially to placental growth hormone's effects on mucosal congestion. 1 The symptoms begin in the first trimester and persist throughout gestation. Many patients thought to have rhinitis of pregnancy may actually have other or coincident causes of rhinitis. 2 An important implication of nasal mucosal edema in pregnancy is that it predisposes to nosebleeds, including from nasal intubations, so an oral approach is favored if intubation is required at the time of delivery.",

The loss of lung volume resulting from elevation of the diaphragm is only partially offset by the increase in chest wall diameter, and therefore functional residual capacity (FRC) is diminished by about 18%, or 300 to 500 mL. 5 This reduction in FRC comprises an equal reduction in both the expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume. 3, 5 The loss of FRC at term is made worse by recumbency, when diaphragm elevation is greatest because of the higher intraabdominal pressure. Increased pulmonary blood volume in pregnancy may also serve to lower the FRC. 6 This reduction in FRC is associated clinically with increased uptake and elimination of inhalational anesthetics and with rapid desaturation during hypopnea, as a result of the loss of the oxygen reservoir function of end-expiratory lung volume. 7 Endotracheal intubation at term is thus substantially more hazardous than in nongravid patients.",

Acceptable \u03b2 2 -agonists in pregnancy include metaproterenol, albuterol, pirbuterol, bitolterol, and terbutaline. Because the toxicology and pharmacology of the longacting \u03b2-agonists salmeterol and formoterol are expected to be similar to shorter-acting \u03b2 2 -agonists, these drugs have been recommended in patients with poor control on a combination of inhaled long-acting corticosteroids and shortacting \u03b2-agonists. 23, 24 Limited data suggest that these drugs are safe in pregnancy. 26 Theophylline also has a long history of use during pregnancy and is considered safe, but the therapeutic range in plasma should be lowered to 5 to 12 \u00b5g/mL because of diminished protein binding during pregnancy. Theophylline passes freely to the fetus, and newborns occasionally show signs of theophylline toxicity, particularly when maternal blood levels are high. Theophylline is also transmitted to breast milk, with a milk-to-serum ratio of about 0.70; but, in general, less than 1% of the maternal dose is transferred to the infant.

Halogenated corticosteroids do not cross the placenta easily, and so fetal and neonatal adrenal suppression is not a major concern with these compounds. 15 Overall, risk-benefit considerations nonetheless favor their use in persistent severe asthma with exacerbations unresponsive to other measures. One study suggests that higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids (i.e., beclomethasone > 1000 mcg/day) may be associated with a small increased risk of congenital abnormalities, although the confounding effect of increased asthma severity cannot be excluded. 29 There are limited data to confirm the safety of newer inhaled costicosteroids. 26 Table 96 -1 summarizes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety classification for agents useful for the treatment of asthma in pregnancy.",

Narcotics other than fentanyl release histamine, which may worsen bronchospasm. Lumbar epidural analgesia is generally preferred, but if general anesthesia is to be used, pretreatment with atropine or glycopyrrolate assists bronchodilation. Ketamine is the preferred anesthetic, although halogenated anesthetics at low concentrations may provide bronchodilation as well. 15 Preterm labor may be safely treated with nifedipine or magnesium sulfate. Oxytocin is the optimal labor induction agent and is useful for postpartum hemorrhage, but 15-methyl prostaglandin F 2a , methylergonovine, and ergonovine may cause bronchospasm and should be avoided if possible. and colleagues 17 performed serial measurements of bronchial reactivity to methacholine challenge in 16 women before and during pregnancy and found a decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness. Clinical and epidemiologic studies, however, have failed to provide convincing evidence of any consistent change in the natural history of asthma during pregnancy. Turner and coworkers, 18 for example, compiled the results of nine studies of asthma symptoms reported by pregnant women. Among them, 22% reported worsening, 29% reported improvement, and 49% reported no change. Other studies have reported similar figures, with about 23% to 42% worsening, 18% to 36% improving, and 40% exhibiting no change. 19, 20 The differences reported in the natural history probably reflect differences in study populations, smoking history, ethnicity, or other variables. 21 Fetal and maternal outcome for asthma and pregnancy have also been examined in a variety of studies since 1980. Adverse outcomes, including an increased incidence of preterm labor, low neonatal birth weight, increased perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, vaginal hemorrhage, chronic hypertension, and complicated labor, have been reported. 15, 21 A large epidemiologic study from Sweden did confirm an association of asthma with perinatal mortality and low birth weight. 22 Nonetheless, adequate therapy tailored to disease severity is associated with good outcomes. 23 Therapy of asthma in pregnancy should be individualized according to severity of disease and frequency of symptoms, as outlined by the NAEPP. 15 Objective measurement of lung volumes and flow should be part of the regimen. Initial office spirometry is recommended, and home peak flow monitoring should be considered. For women who have asthma attacks during labor, fetal monitoring is considered essential by the NAEPP.",

            "text": "Therapy should be based on a step approach. 15 Mild intermittent asthma is best managed with inhaled short-acting \u03b2 2 -agonists, for symptomatic relief. Asthma that causes more than occasional symptoms should be treated daily with anti-inflammatory therapy, with the preferred choice being inhaled corticosteroids. Budesonide is the best studied and hence preferred, although substantive safety data exist for beclomethasone as well. Alternative therapies include cromolyn, sustained-release theophylline, or a leukotriene antagonist. 15 Frequent need for short-acting \u03b2 2 -agonists should prompt institution of, or an increase in, the use of anti-inflammatory agents to treat, rather than to mask, a deteriorating clinical course. Long-acting \u03b2-agonists should only be used concurrently with long-acting inhaled corticosteroids. 21 Finally, the addition of rapidly tapered courses of oral corticosteroids should be considered for those with acute severe asthma or patients with active symptoms who are already using inhaled steroids and \u03b2-agonists. Daily or alternate-day oral steroid administration (e.g., prednisone 40 mg/day) is sometimes required. 15 Extensive practice algorithms have been made available by the NAEPP Working Group on Asthma and Pregnancy. 15 A large body of literature has examined the topic of possible teratogenicity of agents used in the pharmacotherapy of asthma in pregnancy. In general, the risks of poorly controlled asthma far outweigh the possible hazards of drug therapy. Both animal and human studies of \u03b2 2 -agonists, administered either by inhalation or systemically, have strated good maternal and neonatal outcome in women with CF. [34] [35] [36] Premature delivery was more common in women with worse baseline FEV 1 , and gestational diabetes was common. In a large U.S. review of 680 gravid women with CF enrolled in the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation National Patient Registry, from 1985 to 1997, survival was actually better in the gravid group than in the matched 3327 control patients with CF. 37 Women with CF who became pregnant had higher predicted percentages of FEV 1 and higher weights. Pregnancy was not clearly harmful in any subgroup, after severity adjustment for age, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, pancreatic function, and FEV 1 .",

However, presentation may be atypical and disease is often extrapulmonary. 63 Diagnosis may be delayed by a reluctance to perform appropriate imaging studies. Pregnancy does not alter reactivity to tuberculin skin testing, and hence the test should be performed in the recommended groups during pregnancy. Interferon-\u03b3-release assays are also an acceptable means of testing for tuberculous infection (see Chapter 35) . Asymptomatic patients with positive skin tests should have their chest radiograph deferred until after 16 weeks of gestation. Symptomatic patients with positive skin tests merit chest radiographs regardless of gestational stage. Isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol have acceptable safety profiles in pregnancy and are part of the standard treatment regimens advised by the CDC and American Thoracic Society for pregnant women. 64 There is less collective experience with pyrazinamide, but this drug is recommended for use in pregnancy by the World Health Organization. 64 Worldwide data are accumulating, and pyrazinamide appears to be emerging as a drug that can be considered for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and for HIV-infected women. Streptomycin, by contrast, is clearly associated with congenital deafness and is contraindicated during pregnancy. pneumonias, the causative agent is identified in only about half of the cases. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of pneumonia is frequently delayed because of reluctance to obtain a chest radiograph; a posteroanterior radiograph performed with a grid and a peak voltage of 90 to 120 kV exposes the mother to 5 to 30 mrad but the fetus to 100 times less, or about 300 \u00b5rad. 48 A lateral chest radiograph produces greater maternal exposure (150 to 250 mrad) but is usually not required. 48 The hazard to both fetus and mother of delaying the diagnosis greatly exceeds the risk of this small radiation dose. Antibacterial therapy is similar to treatment in the nonpregnant patient, although tetracyclines, quinolones, and metronidazole should be avoided if possible. 48 Erythromycin, azithromycin, and \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are preferred because of their favorable safety profile (see Table 96 -1).",

Because of this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends inactivated influenza vaccine in otherwise healthy women during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. 50 Although influenza virus does cross the placenta, current opinion holds that it is not likely to be teratogenic to the fetus, despite isolated reports that link influenza with neural tube and other malformations.

Stenotic valvular lesions are particularly poorly tolerated. 66 Of these, mitral stenosis is the most common symptomatic valvular disease in pregnancy and frequently presents with pulmonary edema, not only during gestation but also immediately postpartum, because of the large shifts in intravascular volume associated with delivery. The gradient across a stenotic mitral valve is augmented by the increases in blood volume, cardiac output, and heart rate that take place during gestation and the puerperium. In aortic stenosis, the increase in cardiac output required for pregnancy worsens the gradient across the valve. As a compensatory mechanism, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume increases, but the low SVR impairs coronary artery filling during diastole and can precipitate ischemic syndromes. The reduction in SVR of pregnancy mitigates the consequences of mitral and aortic regurgitation and of the left-to-right intracardiac shunts of endocardial cushion defects but worsens the consequences of Eisenmenger syndrome and uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot. Depending on the cardiac disorder, perturbations induced by pregnancy can alter fractional shunts, induce hypoxemia, or precipitate pulmonary edema.",

A Danish populationbased study of 63,000 deliveries found a cumulative incidence of 0.85 in 1000 deliveries from 1984 to 1994. 74 In this study, the incidence of detected venous thromboembolism increased to 1.23 in 1000 deliveries after the introduction of ultrasonography, demonstrating that its reported incidence may depend on the adequacy of diagnostic procedures employed. Other studies have reported rates of 0.6 to 2 per 1000 pregnancies. 75 The risk for thrombosis is increased in pregnancy, partly because of the increase in coagulation factors, particularly V, VIII, X, and von Willebrand factor antigen, and partly because of a marked fall in protein S. 76 Venous stasis, an important contributor to thrombosis, is caused by uterine compression of the inferior vena cava and the left iliac vein. Local trauma to pelvic veins at the time of delivery probably accounts for the peak incidence of thromboembolism in the postpartum period, especially after cesarean section. Specific risk factors for thromboembolism include previous thromboembolism during pregnancy or while taking oral contraceptives, prolonged bed rest, a complicated or cesarean delivery, age, thrombophilia, obesity, and smoking. The inherited defects include deficiencies of antithrombin, protein S, protein C, factor V Leiden, and prothrombin G20210A. 76 Antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired thrombophilia. Previous thromboembolism or antithrombin deficiency warrant prophylactic heparin administration throughout pregnancy, now commonly accomplished with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) due to their safety and decreased risk of heparin-induced osteopenia and thrombocytopenia.",

The initial diagnostic test should be duplex ultrasonography (combined real-time B-mode compression ultrasonography plus Doppler venous ultrasonography). In the patient with high clinical suspicion but a negative test, a repeat examination at 5 to 7 days may be valuable. When venous thrombosis of the lower extremity is documented, it is usually left sided, as it was in 84 of 96 (88%) cases reported by Chan and colleagues. 77 The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in pregnant women is relatively straightforward. Both ventilationperfusion scanning and computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography can be performed during pregnancy in a modified fashion. Estimated fetal radiation exposure for a perfusion scan is about 0.011 to 0.022 cGy (11 to 22 mrad), and simply halving the perfusion dose is standard practice in pregnancy, without greatly impairing resolution. 78 There is no need for the ventilation portion of the study if perfusion is normal. CT pulmonary angiography is an acceptable imaging modality and is associated with similarly low radiation doses to the fetus (Fig. 96-4) . 78, 79 However, a risk to consider is the potential carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure to the mother's breasts, 78, 80 although shielding can reduce exposure (see Fig. 96-4B) .

If the patient survives the initial insult, disseminated intravascular coagulation and ARDS usually supervene. 91 Risk factors include older maternal age, induction of labor, high parity, cesarean section, low uterine segment laceration, and meconium staining of amniotic fluid. [89] [90] [91] Abruptio placentae is present in 50% of cases, and fetal demise in 40%. 91 The maternal mortality rate has been as high as 86%, 92 but a more recent report suggests a mortality of 11% to 43%. 90 Overall, amniotic fluid embolism may account for 14% of all maternal deaths. 73 In a U.S. registry of cases, 78% of the patients with amniotic fluid embolism had ruptured membranes, and several had just undergone intrauterine procedures, 93 clearly implicating traumatic opening of uterine vessels in the pathogenesis. The exact quantity or constituents of amniotic fluid required to initiate the syndrome is unknown. Pathologically, fetal squamous cells are found in the maternal pulmonary circulation at autopsy (Fig. 96-5 ) but, even in symptom-free patients, fetal cells may be aspirated from pulmonary artery catheters placed for other reasons. 94 Hemodynamically, the process is often biphasic, with pulmonary hypertension initially, followed by left ventricular failure. 95, 96 These changes may be caused by leukotrienes and arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly prostaglandin F 2a , which appear in amniotic fluid during labor. An immunologic basis for some of the changes seems likely because women with male fetuses are more likely to acquire the disorder. 90 Clark and associates 93 seized on the similarities to anaphylaxis and suggested that the disorder be renamed advocate titrating the dose to achieve anti-factor X levels of 0.5 to 1.24 units/mL 4 hours after injection. 85, 86 However, the lack of good data and lack of correlation of levels with efficacy or complications makes routine monitoring difficult to justify. 87 LMWH treatment is usually given for at least 6 weeks postpartum (for a minimum total duration of therapy of 3 months). LMWH should be held 24 hours before induction, cesarean section, or neuraxial anesthesia (for twicedaily dosing) or after a 50% dose the morning before delivery for daily dosing regimens. 87 Postpartum, warfarin can be given safely during lactation.",

A, Scout view before the CT acquisition shows an \"internal barium shield\" (arrows) created by having the patient swallow a dilute mixture of barium and water several minutes before CT scanning. The barium distributes within the stomach and proximal small bowel and attenuates internal maternal radiation that may otherwise expose the fetus. A lead apron (arrowheads) also reduces fetal radiation exposure. B, Axial chest CT pulmonary angiogram obtained with manual reduction of both the tube current and tube voltage shows excellent vascular opacification, providing high-quality assessment for pulmonary embolism and other thoracic disorders. A maternal breast shield (arrowheads) has also been placed; these shields selectively filter low-energy x-ray photons that would otherwise deposit preferentially in maternal breast tissue, significantly contributing to maternal breast radiation exposure. a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality. Increased intra-abdominal pressure due to the gravid uterus, the inhibitory effect of progesterone on the tone of the esophageal sphincter, and the assumption of the supine position for delivery all contribute. Eating during or just before labor increases the volume of emesis. 103 Aspiration of gastric contents with pH 2.5 or lower is known to cause chemical pneumonitis and increased permeability edema. Both in Mendelson's original report and today, about two thirds of cases of aspiration take place in the delivery suite. Emergency endotracheal intubation of patients with obstetric crises is particularly difficult, 104 and intubation in the delivery suite fails at a rate eight times that in the general surgical population. 105 To minimize the chance of acid aspiration at intubation, oral administration of histamine-2 blockers with antacids before intubation, 106 in conjunction with a formal airway assessment, is desirable. Identified risk factors in intubation include a high Mallampati class indicating poor visibility of the posterior pharynx, a short neck, protruding maxillary incisors, and a receding mandible. 107",

The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) epidemic resulted in a significant increase in the incidence of ARDS in pregnancy, generating numerous publications on the epidemiologic and management issues. Australian investigators described a series of pregnant women treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with reasonable outcome. 110 Common obstetric causes of ARDS include chorioamnionitis, amniotic fluid embolism (see Fig. 96-6) , and trophoblastic embolism. 111 Ventilator management is unaltered in pregnancy and, although pregnancy was an exclusion criterion in the ARDS Network studies, the clear benefit in nonpregnant patients supports the use of anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy. A small study did not demonstrate evidence of mast cell degranulation but suggested a role for complement activation. 97 On imaging studies, affected patients usually develop bilateral parenchymal opacities consistent with pulmonary edema associated with increased permeability lung injury ( Fig. 96-6 ). Treatment consists of supportive care for the associated disseminated intravascular coagulation and left ventricular and respiratory failure. The fetus should be promptly delivered. In cases of maternal demise, emergency postmortem or periresuscitative cesarean section is warranted, as it is in other instances of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in pregnancy. 98",

It appears to account for about 2.8% to 5.6% of spontaneous pneumothoraces in women, 123, 124 most often affecting women in the third or fourth decade of life. About 30% to 60% of cases are attributable to thoracic endometriosis, as judged by inspection at thoracotomy (Fig. 96-7) 125 ; other cases have a more obscure etiology, however, so a number of theories have been advanced. The first theory is that, during menstruation, the absence of the normal cervical mucus plug permits an open connection between ambient air and the abdominal cavity through the uterus and fallopian tubes. 124 Air can move transdiaphragmatically through right-sided diaphragmatic fenestrations into the pleural space, as it sometimes does during abdominal laparoscopy, 126 accounting for the condition's right-sided predominance. 124 A second theory is that high levels of prostaglandin F 2a during menstruation cause bronchospasm with attendant air trapping and pneumothorax, but wheezing is not a common symptom of this disorder. A third theory is that pleural blebs or bullae are more susceptible to rupture during menstruation because of hormonal changes, 124, 125 but visceral pleural leaks are rarely found at surgery (see also Chapter 81 for a full discussion).",

As described previously, endometriosis can result in recurrent catamenial pneumothorax, which is its most common thoracic presentation (see Fig. 96-7) . In one review of 110 cases with thoracic endometriosis, catamenial pneumothorax was the presenting symptom in 73% of cases, followed by hemothorax in 14% and hemoptysis in 7%. 127 It also has been associated with right-sided pleural pain, pleuritic effusions, and hemothorax. Inspection at thoracotomy or thoracoscopy typically reveals blue-brown nodules on the pleural surface, sometimes in a \"gunshot\" distribution. 128 The absence of known pelvic endometriosis does not exclude the diagnosis because only 20% to 70% of patients have associated pelvic disease. The diagnosis is suspected on clinical grounds because neither CT nor endoscopy is specific. 129 Rarely, the endometriosis deposits are found in lung parenchyma, accounting for the catamenial hemoptysis. Most pleural and diaphragmatic disease is thought to arise from transdiaphragmatic spread from retrograde menses, even when abdominal disease is not evident. Massive ascites is sometimes related, although only 27 cases have been reported. 130 Pneumothoraces may be attributed to cyclical sloughing of tissue on key surfaces, such as the visceral pleura, 131 or to air trapping from airway involvement or compression. 122 Pulmonary parenchymal disease may be embolic in origin, as is presumed to be in the case of central nervous system endometriosis. The diagnosis can be established only by biopsy showing the characteristic ectopic endometrial glands in involved sites. Medical therapy consists of progestational agents or gonadotropinreleasing hormones; surgical approaches include excision, local laser ablation, or pleurodesis.",

            "text": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disorder that afflicts predominantly premenopausal women. 132, 133 The most common presenting event is a pneumothorax, reported in 86.5% of patients in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute registry. 132 It is fundamentally a disorder of smooth muscle proliferation that results in functional obstruction of vessels, lymphatics, and airways. (See Chapter 69 for a complete discussion of LAM.) Involvement of pulmonary vascular structures is responsible for the hemoptysis, whereas lymphatic obstruction accounts for the chylous effusions. Mediastinal and retroperitoneal lymphatic proliferation may be a feature of the disease as well. LAM is also associated with renal angiomyolipomas, another hamartomatous disorder, and with tuberous scle-maternal blood volume, of about 2 L (40%), and cardiac output, after 25 to 32 weeks of gestation, of 30% to 45%. \u25a0 The most common pulmonary disorder of pregnancy is asthma, but the effects of pregnancy on asthma are variable: it worsens, improves, or remains unchanged in roughly one third of afflicted women. \u25a0 The risks of poorly controlled asthma for both mother and fetus during pregnancy far outweigh the risks of drug therapy. Some standard drugs are safer than others (see Table 96 -1) and should be selected whenever possible. \u25a0 Cystic fibrosis and infectious pneumonias have all been linked with adverse fetal and maternal outcomes, the risk of which depends largely on the severity of the complicating disorder. Prepregnancy counseling and avoidance of certain antimicrobial drugs (as noted in Table 96 -1) are strongly recommended. \u25a0 Pulmonary edema may develop during pregnancy in women with underlying heart disease, especially valvular stenosis, cardiomyopathy, and preeclampsia. Because the causative mechanisms differ, so does specific therapy. \u25a0 Pulmonary embolism is a leading cause of maternal mortality. When indicated during pregnancy, lowmolecular-weight heparins are safe for both treatment and prevention; warfarin is contraindicated. Ventilation-perfusion imaging, CT pulmonary angiography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be used as needed.",
