Therefore, diarrhea due to pathogenic E. coli can be common[22]. The overall level of medical care is low, accessibility to medical institutions is limited, and there is a lack of infection prevention and response systems. Direct transmission between humans or animal to human is likely[23].In 2017, travelers entered Korea with diarrhea were quarantined and tested for WFB communicable diseases.Chi-square analysis was conducted to analyze the related factors affecting WFB communicable diseases. The results demonstrated that both entry period and the countries visited were crucial factors. In this study, causative agents of WFB communicable diseases were detected in the laboratory and the related factors were analyzed from 2013 to 2017. However, depending on the health declaration during quarantine inspection, there may have been limitations to confirm the characteristic of food and the travel environment of travelers. In future studies, the control variables such as gender, age, food intake, travel environment are necessary to investigate and analyze related factors affecting the test result of WFB communicable diseases. Previous studies have used the positive ratio of people entering Korea with diarrhea and based on results of specimens collected in quarantine. However, this study was conducted in consideration of the number of multi-detections of the pathogen status from each travelers in 2017, as well as the positive rate of the travelers under laboratory test and the status of pathogen. This study confirmed that the number of people entering Korea who were quarantined with fever, respiratory symptoms and diarrhea increased from 2013 to 2017. Moreover, the number of causative agents from WFB communicable diseases in 2017 was the highest betweenJuly and September, when many people entered Korea from Southeast Asia. There were many cases of WFB communicable diseases in Southeast Asia. By chi-square test the entry period and the country visited prior to entry in Korea were statistically significant factors.",
