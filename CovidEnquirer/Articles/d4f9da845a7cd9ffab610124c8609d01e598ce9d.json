Using the ResPlexII v2.0 (Qiagen) multiplex PCR, 393 positive results were obtained in 468 clinical samples collected during an influenza season in Germany. The overall distribution of positive results was influenza A 42.0%, influenza B 38.7%, adenovirus 1.5%, bocavirus 0.5%, coronavirus 3.3%, enterovirus 5.6%, metapneumovirus 1.0%, parainfluenza virus 0.8%, rhinovirus 4.1%, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 2.5%. Double infections of influenza virus together with another virus were found for adenovirus B and E, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus and for rhinovirus. These other viruses were rapidly lost upon passages in MDCK 33016PF cells and under conditions as applied to influenza virus passaging. Clinical samples, in which no influenza virus but other viruses were found, were also subject to passages in MDCK 33016PF cells. Using lower inoculum dilutions than those normally applied for preparations containing influenza virus (total dilution of the original sample of \u223c10 4 ), the positive results for the different viruses turned negative already after 2 or 3 passages in MDCK 33016PF cells. These results demonstrate that, under practical conditions as applied to grow influenza viruses, contaminating viruses can be effectively removed by passages in MDCK cells. In combination with their superior isolation efficiency, MDCK cells appear highly suitable to be used as an alternative to embryonated eggs to isolate and propagate influenza vaccine candidate viruses.",

Due to receptor limitations, such egg passaging can cause adaptive mutations of the haemagglutinin [1, 2] . These egg-adaptive mutations do not revert on subsequent passage in mammalian cells, and they may alter the antigenic properties of the receptor binding site, which is also a critical binding site for virus inhibiting and protective antibodies [3, 4] . In contrast to egg-passaged virus, mammalian cell-grown influenza virus preserves the sequence of the original human clinical sample.",

This change to cell culture was stimulated not only by the relative ease of conducting multiple isolations in cell cultures but also by the better antigenic match of MDCK-isolated viruses with field strains. Increasing difficulties in recovering isolates from embryonated eggs, particularly of H 3 N 2 subtypes, has also contributed to the change to cell culture [5] .",

Using the conventional, recommended reference viruses, these vaccines still originate from egg-derived virus isolates or the corresponding high-growth reassortants. Regulatory concerns, mainly with regard to the introduction of adventitious agents, are raised if candidate vaccine strains are derived directly from uncharacterised and uncontrolled cell lines. Collaborative studies have been initiated to investigate the growth and yield of influenza viruses in different cell lines, the efficiency and fidelity of influenza virus isolation, and the suitability for vaccine manufacture of different cell substrates [7] . Growth studies with a wide range of potentially contaminating viruses have been conducted and risk assessments have been made, comparing egg-derived and cell-passaged influenza viruses with regard to the risk of carrying adventitious viruses into vaccine manufacturing processes [8, 9] . These assessments indicated that, in comparison to manufacturing in embryonated eggs, the introduction of Vero cells increases the risk of transmitting various viruses into the vaccine process, whereas the use of MDCK cells reduces the overall risk. Due to their limited permissiveness to viral growth, MDCK cell exert the same filter effect for human adventitious viruses as do embryonated eggs.",

During those 3-4 days the cells grew from an initial seeding density of 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml to densities between 1.0 and 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml.

To obtain a total culture volume of 5 ml, the added viral inoculum was diluted in 0.5 ml infection medium and was pre-diluted by several log 10 steps, starting with a total dilution of at least 1:100. Inoculated cultures were then incubated at 33 \u2022 C for 3 days in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere in a ISF-1-W shaker incubator (Kuhner, Birsfelden, Switzerland).

Because of this short timeline, conventional broad spectrum testing of the influenza virus seed for adventitious agents cannot be performed in time, particularly if one considers that months may be needed to prepare virus from an independent source and specific antibodies against the same to neutralise the influenza virus. For conventional egg-derived viral seeds it is commonly assumed and supported by historical safety records, that many adventitious viruses are removed by egg passages. Because cell-derived influenza virus isolates are now being considered for use as starting material for vaccine manufacture, information is needed about the behaviour of adventitious viruses during cultivation of influenza viruses in suitable cell substrates. Our studies contribute such information for a cell line that is qualified for influenza vaccine manufacture.",

No growth was observed for the other viruses and agents tested. Infectious titers declined and were in most cases no longer detectable after 3-5 days of cultivation. Only for few very stable viruses, such as SV-40, virus titers persited longer. Based upon those studies, and supported by the results of a systematic literature search (applicable to standard adherently growing MDCK cells), MDCK 33016 suspension cells support the growth of only a limited range of viruses. In this context the relevant viruses are influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, reovirus, and herpes simplex virus. This permissiveness spectrum is very similar to that seen in embryonated eggs [7] . Therefore, like embryonated eggs used in current influenza vaccine manufacture, MDCK 33016 cells should act as an effective barrier for a wide range of adventitious agents. Moreover, MDCK 33016 cells do not support the replication of many avian viruses. This is of particular relevance if an avian virus contaminant is introduced into the process by prior passaging of the vaccine virus strain in embryonated eggs.",

Considering the selection of specimens, the high percentage of influenza-positive results is not surprising, but a significant number of samples (66/370 or 17.8%) also tested positive for other viruses, such as adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Except for RSV and PIV, the same viruses were also detected as co-infections together with influenza virus. Such co-infections together with influenza viruses have also been published previously for RSV [23] [24] [25] , PIV [23] , HMPV [25, 26] , and for adenovirus and bocavirus [24] , although the overall frequency was comparatively low. Those previous reports were all based on PCR detection methods, applying a more restricted virus spectrum than the ResPlex II method. We were unable to find reports about co-infections of influenza virus with other viruses identified via cell culture isolation methods, although such double-infected study materials have certainly been used in high numbers. This indicates that cell cultures selectively support replication of specific viruses and that, in addition, the virus identification methods used were less specific or less sensitive than PCR-based methods.",

We have compared the novel ResPlex III assay and existing techniques for the detection and subtyping of influenza virus during the influenza season 2006-2007 [27] . The methodology must necessarily make some compromises, for example, with regard to amplification conditions during the first cycles with specific primers.
