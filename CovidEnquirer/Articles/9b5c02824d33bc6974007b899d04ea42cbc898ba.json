It is concluded that at present the welter of information that has been gathered does not contribute in any major, coherent way to our understanding of the etiology or pathogenesis of the disorder. Several of the abnormalities that have been observed may be future candidates for biochemical markers for multiple sclerosis; at present none is sufficiently reliable, distinctive or easily performed to warrant the status of a useful diagnostic or prognostic test.",

            "text": "p ossible abnormalities of serum or plasma components in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have attracted the attention of many investigators. The impetus behind these studies is two-fold. First is the hope that a better understanding of the cause and pathogenesis of MS will emerge. Second is the search for sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic indicators. This review will attempt to document and evaluate many of the abnormalities in serum and plasma constituents that have been observed. A number of abnormalities in erythrocytes, white blood cells and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with MS have also been reported. These contributions to our understanding of the disorder are not covered in this review unless they relate directly to alterations in the composition of the serum or plasma. Because of the large number of publications touching on some aspects of the subject of this review, a process of selection was necessary. Many relevant articles published before 1980 have not been included. This policy was applied with particular stringency to reports concerning the immuneresponses in patients with MS--a topic which was comprehensively reviewed in 1980 by Iivanainen (1) .",

The reverse is true for brain myelin and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) where galactocerebrosides predominate (3) . CSF cerebrosides were found to be consistently elevated at all stages of MS and this finding was more characteristic than were changes in a number of other individual lipids and lipid classes (4) . The concept that an increase in the serum concentration of galactocerebrosides might reflect destruction of the central nervous system (CNS) has been investigated in a small number of patients and controls with conflicting results. Jones and co-workers (2, 5) were unable to demonstrate a difference in cerebroside composition or level either between pooled plasma from a large number of patients with MS and normal controls, or between individual samples from five patients and age-matched controls. Even in stroke patients, in whom relatively major destruction of the CNS occurs, the percent of total cerebrosides in plasma due to galactocerebrosides did not differ significantly from the percent found in controls. On the other hand, Baumann et al. (6) noted an elevation in the plasma level of galactocerebrosides in 4 of 12 patients with MS but in only 1 of 10 stroke patients. It can be tentatively concluded that the consistent increase in CSF galactocerebroside levels that has been observed in patients with MS is not as often accompanied by a comparable change in plasma levels.",

It has also been shown in the rabbit that gangliosides move rapidly from the CSF into the plasma (9) . Sela et al. (10) reported a significant increase in the concentration of ganglioside-bound sialic acid in pooled serum from 20 patients with clinically definite MS (926 tLg/100 mL) as compared to the concentration in pooled serum from the same number of FORD healthy blood donors (691 ~g/100 mL). The pattern of individual gangliosides in the two pooled sera was identical. It was also found that peripheral blood lymphocytes from MS patients contained, on average, 39% more ganglioside than lymphocytes from the control group. These observations are of interest since gangliosides have been shown to alter the immune response of lymphocytes in vitro (11, 12) . Further work is needed to assess what role, if any, blood or CSF gangliosides play in the altered immune response that is characteristic of many patients with MS (1, 12a). # Although the early literature is contradictory with regard to the phospholipid composition of the serum in MS (reviewed in reference 13), later workers agree that neither the total nor the individual phospholipid content of serum from MS patients differs from normal (13) (14) (15) . A reported increase in lysolecithin concentration in plasma of MS patients as compared with normal subjects (16) was probably a nonspecific consequence of illness since two groups could find no difference when MS patients were compared with patients with other neurological diseases (14, 15) . no definite conclusions can be reached concerning zinc status and compartmentalization in MS patients.",

A relative decrease in cholesterol linoleate and an increase in tri-and tetra-unsaturated fatty acid esters of cholesterol were also observed in MS patients, especially during the progressive stage of the disease (18). Love and co-workers (19) found a decrease in linoleic acid content of serum lipids to be a general phenomenon in ill patients and not specific for MS. Several other groups were also unable to find a characteristic abnormality in total or cholesterol-esterified linoleic acid concentration in MS serum (20) (21) (22) . MS patients apparently do show a consistent decrease in the levels of linoleic and arachidonic acids in CSF (23), however the pathophysiological significance of this finding is unclear. Possible abnormalities in linoleate metabolism in MS patients have attracted considerable interest because of the controversial diagnostic test for MS which depends on a characteristic decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of erythrocytes from MS patients in the presence of linoleic acid (24) and because of the possible therapeutic value of linoleate supplementation of the diet (25, 26) .",

The results of this study, conducted in Great Britain, differed from the significantly lower levels of enzyme activity observed in MS patients in Denmark (61) and Israel (62) . Glutathione peroxidase is a selenium-containing enzyme and in animals its activity is affected by selenium intake. Whatever the reasons for the difference in results obtained in the three countries, it is doubtful that deficiency of either selenium or glutathione peroxidase activity contributes to the etiology or pathogenesis of MS. Mehlert et al. (60) point out that decreased levels of glutathione peroxidase activity have been reported in several areas of the world without associated pathological conditions. III. IMMUNOGLOBULINS A1-Agidi and Roberts (63) measured the serum levels of immunoglobulin classes in a large group of MS patients and controls in Orkney, an island with an extremely high incidence of MS. Aside from a slight increase in the mean concentration of IgE in patients from rural areas, no significant differences were found. Pandey et al. (64) observed a difference between MS patients and controls in the frequency of IgG heavy chain allotypes in serum. The Gm genes encode for either of two allelic heavy chains within each IgG subclass in humans. Caucasians with the Gm 1,17;21 phenotype were almost four times more likely to develop MS than those without it. It was suggested that this finding was further evidence (in addition to the predominance of certain HLA phenotypes in MS patients, for example) of an abnormality in the immune response in patients with MS.",

Whether the level of antibody titre against measles virus is (74) or is not (72, 73) influenced by the HLA type of the individual patient is a subject of disagreement. Some studies have failed to find a significant difference in measles antibody titres between MS patients and control groups (79, 80) . Poskanzer et al. (79) carried out a serologic survey of antibody titres against 17 viruses, including measles, among inhabitants of the Orkney and Shetland Islands, an area of extremely high incidence of MS. No consistent pattern of antibody levels or of the presence or absence of antibodies was found in MS patients when compared with two control groups. Because of the isolation of the islands, the mean age of acquisition of childhood viral infections, including measles, is older than that of inhabitants of many other parts of the world. It was of interest that 6 patients contracted clinical measles 2-9 years after the onset of MS. The authors concluded that the results failed to incriminate any of the viruses tested in the etiology of MS.",

Measles and canine distemper viruses are highly related antigenically. Based on an inability to demonstrate specific canine distemper virus antibodies in the sera of MS patients, it has been suggested (77, 81) that reactivity of measles antibodies in the assays for canine distemper virus antibodies explains the results of studies which showed elevated titres against the latter virus and that canine distemper virus is unlikely to be involved in the etiology of MS.",

Because of the wide range of titres in paired CSF and serum samples from the same patient, it was suggested that the synthesis of the antibodies occurred both intra-and extra-thecally. The anti-brain antibodies have been characterized by bacterial absorption and found to be primarily of the IgG1 and/or IgG2 subclasses (86) . In some MS patients anti-brain antibodies cannot be demonstrated and this is apparently not due to the presence of a serological inhibitor (87) . Anti-brain antibodies were present in 40% of the serum and 88% of the CSF samples from patients with clinically definite MS; the corresponding figures were 21% and 73% for probable MS, and 11% and 6% for controls (88) . Although antibrain antibody titres in serum were higher in patients with a more malignant course, there was no consistent correlation between remissions and exacerbations in the clinical course and changes in antibody titres (89) . Others (90), using a different assay, were unable to demonstrate a difference between MS patients and controls in the binding of serum immunoglobulins to homogenates of brain. Ryberg (85) claims that in such assays nonspecific binaing of IgG obscures the increase in anti-brain antibody titres in MS serum which is detected by his complement fixation technique.",

            "text": "A number of investigators now believe that the binding of serum immunoglobulins to oligodendrocytes and glial cells is nonspecific, as usually studied, and is not a distinguishing feature of MS (98) (99) (100) (101) . Indirect studies indicated that the binding reactions were due to the presence of Fc receptors on the oligodendrocytes and that the reactions were, therefore, nonspecific. Furthermore, it has been pointed out (101) that the use of bovine oligodendrocyte preparations to demonstrate antibodies in human sera directed against human oligodendrocytes may result in failure to identify specific and pathogenetically relevant immune responses in MS patients because of interspecies differences in cell surface characteristics. Two groups consider their assay system to be specific with regard to both the antibody and the glial cell. Singh and Mashal (102) found glial-cell-binding antibodies in 43% of MS sera examined. They claimed the reaction was specific for the glial cell in their culture system and that no binding occurred when sera from normal subjects or patients with other neurological diseases were used. Mar (103) (120) reported that the serum of MS patients was capable of initiating a specific, antibody-dependent, lymphocytemediated cellular toxicity against a rat glial tumour cell line. The gliotoxic-stimulating activity was found to be significantly higher in MS sera than in normal sera or sera from patients with other neurological diseases. The gliotoxic activity was tissue-specific for glial cells and was greatest in patients with chronic progressive MS and least in those with stable disease. Do any of these various anti-brain antibodies play a role in the pathogenesis of MS? A strong case can be made that MS is a disease of immune regulation (12a) . If this hypothesis is true, a principal question that must be answered concerns the nature of the neural antigens involved. At present, no clearcut answers to this question are available. Some reasons have been given above for the inconclusive results that have thus far been obtained. An especially telling argument against a pathogenetic role for any of the anti-brain antibodies that have been described is that in each instance a substantial proportion of patients with MS do not appear to have the antibody or it is present in normal subjects or in those with other neurological diseases.",

The levels correlated significantly with serum measles antibody titres but not with the clinical course. Other workers (105-108) have confirmed that cold-reacting lymphocytotoxic antibodies are found more frequently in MS patients than in controls. Scott et al. (107) absorbed sera with pooled human platelets in an attempt to remove interfering anti-HLA antibodies. After absorption 8 of 32 MS sera, but only 1 of 20 control sera, remained lymphocytotoxic. The cytotoxicity was greatest towards suppressor T cells, as defined by a monoclonal antibody. All MS sera positive for lymphotoxins were from patients with active or progressive disease. Tsukamoto and co-workers (108) also observed a marked increase in the incidence of these antibodies in MS patients during periods of increased disease activity (83% of patients positive); others (104, 106) did not observe such a correlation. It is suggested that these antibodies may be markers for viral infection associated with MS or may play a role in modulating the immune response, or both.",

Contrary results were reported by Mogensen and co-workers (110) who found that serum from patients with MS was less inhibitory for mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte transformation than was serum from patients with other neurological diseases.

Olsson and Nilsson (121) subjected serum and CSF to isoelectric focusing and found that bands in serum corresponding to those in CSF were present in 10% of MS patients. Because the bands in serum were fainter, the authors suggested that they were derived from the CSF. This report confirmed earlier work by Laurenzi and Link (122) who observed oligoclonal bands in the serum of 41% of MS patients. Oligoclonal bands in serum are only rarely demonstrated by agarose gel electrophoresis which is less sensitive than isoelectric focusing (123) . Mehta et al. (126) reported that 70% of MS patients had oligoclonal bands of IgG in their sera after isoelectric focusing. The banding pattern was generally similar to that of the CSF. Later work by the same group (127) , however, showed that in the individual MS patient the majority of oligoclonal bands in serum differed with respect to number, isoelectric point and light chain type from the bands seen in the patient's CSF.",

Patients with immune complexes tended to exhibit a more rapid clinical deterioration. This latter observation was confirmed by Jans et al. (132) . Trouillas and co-workers (133) detected immune complexes in the sera of 43% of patients with MS and in 52% of their first degree relatives, but could find no association between the clinical course of MS and the presence or absence of the complexes.

It was concluded that the complexes were not precipitating factors in the pathogenesis of MS. These workers went on to characterize further the immune complexes in MS patients by an antigen-specific immune complex radioimmunoassay which detected the presence of myelin membrane-related antigens (136) . A significant correlation was observed between the serum levels of immune complexes detected by a standard method (Clq reactivity) and by myelin membrane-related antigenicity. The buoyant density of the antigenic complex on sucrose gradient centrifugation suggested that it contained lipid. Further work will be required to establish a role for these specific immune complexes in MS. Obviously, it is hoped that characterization of the antigenic moiety of the complex will lead to an understanding of the neural antigen(s) important in the pathogenesis of MS as a disease Of autoimmunity. Dasgupta and co-workers (137) and Noronha et al. (138) observed a significantly higher incidence of immune complexes in serum of MS patients during active disease as compared with those in remission. These results, which differ from many earlier studies and suggest a pathogenetic role for immune complexes, were explained as being due to the application of more sensitive assays than had been previously used.",

The major portion of the demyelinating activity was not associated with the serum immunoglobulins. Ulrich and Lardi (142) reported that 51% of sera from patients with a variety of neurological diseases other than MS but only 14% of MS patients were positive for demyelination activity. Seil et al.

In agreement with the results of Bornstein and coworkers, a correlation was observed between serum demyelinating activity and disease activity. The authors speculated that serum demyelinating activity is an epiphenomenon not directly related to the pathogenesis of MS.",

The brevity of these fluctuations in neurological signs and symptoms is often incompatible with the time required for demyelination followed by remyelination. Schauf and Davis (144) used as a test system the isolated spinal cord of frogs. Although they were unable to demonstrate any FORD effect of MS sera on the conduction of either normal or demyelinated nerves, they did observe blockade of ventral root responses by serum from MS patients. The level of such neuroelectric blocking activity correlated with variations in the course of the disease. It was not present in normal serum but was observed in serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On the other hand, Seil and co-workers (reviewed in reference 145) concluded that there was no evidence to indicate that neuroelectric blocking factors play a role in human neurological diseases. These investigators used mouse cerebral neocortex cultures as the test system. They found that neuroelectric blocking factors were not specific for demyelinating diseases and that such factors were present in a high proportion of normal sera.",

Unfortunately, this extensive collection of information has not contributed in any major, coherent way to our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of the disorder. As a clearer picture of the cause of MS emerges, perhaps we will recognize the importance of certain abnormalities which are currently regarded as nonspecific or epiphenomena. Furthermore, none of the reported changes has proved to be sufficiently reliable and distinctive to gain the status of a diagnostic or prognostic test. It may be that the sensitive and specific abnormalities associated with MS are more subtle than suspected or do not appear to an appreciable extent in serum or plasma. Alternatively, MS may have multiple etiologies and pathogeneses which, although producing a recognizable clinical picture, do not lead to a single characteristic abnormality in serum or plasma.",
