Chaolin Huang et al. reported acute kidney injury (AKI) in 7% of the 41 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, this value was even higher (up to 31%) among intensive-care patients 1 reported that plasma creatinine level increased in 4.3% of severely diseased patients 3 . SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious pathogen that predominantly causes pneumonic symptoms. To date, infection by this virus has caused tens of thousands of fatalities, and hundreds of thousands of people have been isolated as a preventive measure. Although respiratory failure has been associated with the highest mortality, the lungs were not the only organs involved. Hoffmann et al. reported that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share a common receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is required to enter target cells, and cellular protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) can cleave and activate the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 for membrane fusion 4 . We investigated whether ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in kidney cells using precision-technology single-cell RNA sequencing.",

Interestingly, ACE2 was found to be expressed in several human organs such as the intestines, adrenal gland, gallbladder, and in the kidneys, and it was highly expressed in the urogenital and digestive systems. ACE2 was highly expressed in the glandular cells of the intestine and gallbladder ( Figure 1C ). As SARS-CoV-2 preferably occurs in the lungs, we tested whether ACE2 was also expressed in lung tissue; however, we found that ACE2 showed only low expression levels in normal lungs, and only some positive staining was observed in lung macrophages ( Figure 1C ). Therefore, whether ACE2 levels would increase due to SARS-CoV-2 infection requires further investigation. Consistent with single-cell RNA sequencing data, ACE2 was predominantly expressed in the proximal tubules ( Figure 1C ).",
