With calves under general anesthesia, a biopsy of small intestine was taken after each xylose test to examine morphological changes in mucosa by scanning electron microscopy.",

Calves in this group lost weight and had more severe diarrhea and higher mortality than those fed other diets. They also had low absorption of xylose (Table 2 ). Roy et al. (24) found thickened intestinal walls in calves fed FPC or SF. Digestibilities of FPC have been 10 to 30% lower than that of milk protein, and there may be deficiencies of certain essential amino acids in fish protein (13) . Antinutritional factors in soybeans may limit their utilization by young calves. Trypsin inhibitor is largely inactivated by heat treatment of the soy product, but it may be re- activated in the alkaline pH of the proximal small intestine (23) . The importance of TI in the nutrition of calves fed soy-containing milk replacers is uncertain, but it may block the activity of the pancreatic enzymes trypsin and chymotrypsin in the intestine, thus inhibiting normal proteolysis.",

Degeneration of mucosa was more rapid and more severe with SPC than with SF. Problems with feeding soy protein were due at least partially to antigens contained in the soy products, and TI content may have been a significant factor. Calves fed FPC performed poorly, had high mortality, and those that survived were weak. Calves fed milk replacers consumed less protein than those fed milk and this may partially explain the differences observed.",
