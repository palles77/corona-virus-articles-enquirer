Rather than modulating ER stress in host cells, TUDCA abolished the proton conductivity of viral M2 by disrupting its oligomeric states, which induces inefficient viral infection. We also showed that M2 penetrated cells, whose intracellular uptake depended on its proton channel activity, an effect observed in both TUDCA and M2 inhibitor amantadine.

Dynamic entry of IAV starts from binding of haemagglutinin (HA) with sialic acid [5] , followed by two pH-controlled events. The optimal acid milieu in late endosomes triggers conformational alterations of HA, which fuses IAV with host endosomal membrane. Prior to fusion, acidic activation of the M2 ion channel occurs in early endosomes, which facilitates IAV uncoating [6] . Thus, inhibiting HA or M2 constitutes the primary mechanisms to suppress IAV entry. Though M2 inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine, can block IAV entry, the emergence of adamantane-resistant M2 and associated adverse effects temper their clinical application [7] .",

M2 oligomerization, based on assessment of either tetramerization of M2 TM peptides or dimerization of full-length M2, was particularly necessary for its entire channel function [8] [9] [10] [11] . TM of M2 was sufficient to form tetrameric M2 [12] , which was unstable unless AH is present [9, 10, 13] .

We consistently observed increased IRE-1a and Bip signals of UPR in A549 cells after infection with seasonal New Caledonia/20/1999 H1N1 IAV (Fig. S1a online) . UPR activation occurred in parallel with hyperplasia of smooth ER, which became striking 24 h post infection (Fig. 1a) . However, UPR responsive pathways were absent in HPAI A H5N1-challenged host ( Fig. S1b online) , including IRE-1a branch (Fig. S1a online) . Though lack of typical UPR signatures, a remarkable ER swelling was detectable 1 h after H5N1 infection (Fig. 1a ). This result confirmed ER involvement in IAV life cycle and further suggested different ER responses to seasonal and highly pathogenic IAV infection. In contrast to previous reports where UPR activation mediates pandemic IAV-induced acute lung injuries (ALI) [23] , the absence of UPR in highly pathogenic H5N1-infected cells in our study suggests alternative underlying mechanisms. In light of severe ER swelling induced 1 h after H5N1 infection, we explored the potentiality of clinically available ER stress inhibitors, TUDCA and 4-PBA, as anti-H5N1 strategies.",

When added 12 h before and during infection, TUDCA restored A549 cell viability from 41.6% to 82.5% 48 h after H5N1 exposure (Fig. 1b) with a nearly undetectable viral load (Fig. 1c) . Notably, the anti-H5N1 effect of TUDCA was only achieved at relatively high doses, which were much greater than those used to relieve ER stress [22, 23] . In view of good tolerance and apparent benefits of high dose TUDCA against lethal IAV infection (Fig. S1c, d online) , we utilized 3 mmol/ L in our in vitro studies. Due to lack of UPR, TUDCA did not impact UPR markers in H5N1-exposed cells, though H1N1-infected cells could possess a tight association of TUDCA with IRE-1a (Fig. S1a , b online), as shown previously [22] . In contrast, 4-PBA failed to rescue H5N1-induced cell death (Fig. S1e, f online) , which supports an UPR-independent antiviral action of TUDCA. Moreover, protection of the host against H5N1 infection was unsuccessful when TUDCA was added 3 h post H5N1 challenge compared to prophylactic interventions (\u00c06 and \u00c03 h) or therapeutic treatments within 2 h after infection (Fig. 1d) . As 2-3 h is the critical time point corresponding to the end of HA fusion and the start of viral genome transportation [26] , our results suggest IAV entry as a target of TUDCA.",

To clarify in which step TUDCA plays a role, we permuted TUDCA treatment into four tactics based on when TUDCA is administered to the host, namely either before or concomitant with IAV infection (Figs. 2c and S2c (online)). Intriguingly, even when cells were not pre-exposed, as long as TUDCA was applied during IAV infection (\u00c0/+), TUDCA inhibition of IAV entry was comparable to the condition where TUDCA was added both before and during infection (+/+). Meanwhile, presence of TUDCA during infection (\u00c0/+ and +/+) was critical, as removal of TUDCA during infection even after a 12 h pre-treatment of the host (+/\u00c0) failed to prevent viral infection, an effect similar to non-TUDCA-treated cells (\u00c0/\u00c0). This result suggests that the anti-IAV effects of TUDCA unlikely rely on priming host cells. We further verified this point by testing dynamics of host cell endocytosis using virus-free, fluorescence-labeled dextran (Fig. 2d) . Our results showed no inhibition of dextran uptake by TUDCA at both 20 and 60 min after dextran loading, indicating that TUDCA does not affect host endocytosis. In addition, TUDCA as a bile acid may sequester cholesterol from the cellular membrane, leading to attenuated viral entry [27] . Here, we found no decrease of internalized H5N1 when cells were pre-incubated with cholesterol-depleting methyl-bcyclodextrin (MbCD, Figs. 2e and S2d (online)), consistent with H1N1-infected cells [28] . Altogether, these data indicate TUDCA may target IAV instead of the host.",

In response to acid, the preattached IAV should immediately fuse with the plasma membrane.

Though mechanisms by which IAV induce ER stress have been attributed to accumulated IAV proteins in the ER lumen during IAV replication [22] , changes of ER morphology 1 h post H5N1 exposure are indicative of other interactions between ER and IAV. Besides assembling and folding newly synthesized proteins, ER as intracellular bank of Ca 2+ also regulates cytosolic Ca 2+ . Indeed, IAV infection induced cytosolic Ca 2+ oscillations in host cells, which was required for efficient IAV internalization [29] . Yet, details behind ER pathophysiology during IAV entry remain mostly unclear, it opens interesting questions -whether UPR activation induces detrimental or beneficial host responses following IAV infection and whether typical ER signals serve as indicators of viral virulence.",

            "text": "In the current study, we generated a series of iVLPs, among which iVLPm1-2 was of unexpected. First, it forms a liposomelike structure with measurable M2 proton channel activity. Second, iVLPm1-2 can penetrate freely into cells, probably through endocytic pathways. Third, the penetrating potential of iVLPm1-2 may rely on M2, which is likely endowed with a cell-penetrating competence. From the first identification of proteins that can move across cellular membranes, a group of proteins with similar features was classified as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) [30] . One class of CPPs was identified comprising a high degree of amphipathicity, where AH is the most common structural motif [31] . In AH, hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids are usually grouped on separate faces of helix, with a highly hydrophobic patch on one face and a cationic patch on the other face. Penetration of CPPs containing AH is mainly due to the amphipathicity of AH [32] . Regarding M2, the existence of AH in C-terminus has been reported by several groups [15, 16, 33] and its putative function involves viral budding and scission [33, 34] . When expressed in host cells, AHs of M2, which are arranged parallel to membrane, partially penetrate themselves through its hydrophobic face mediating mem-brane deformation [35] . In this regard, it is plausible that AH of M2 utilizes a similar mechanism triggering IAV entry by inducing membrane curvature. However, due to being interior of IAV, it is more likely that AH of M2 reinforces the contact between the viral envelope and host membrane by a protruding viral envelope. The implication of M2 as CPP is by far not fully defined and additional work will be required to understand whether the CPP property of M2 is the nature of IAV entry. Besides cell-penetration, AH that is positively charged could be attracted by negatively charged BA. BA are facial amphiphiles, adopting an almost flat conformation with a rigid steroidal backbone in parallel with the interface, which allows contact of hydroxyl groups with the aqueous environment [36] . Typically, conjugated head groups of BAs are able to capture cationic species [37] . Our TEM and AFM data (Figs. 3f and S3f, g (online)) suggest that TUDCA may form a complex with M2, which inherited the flat conformation of BA. This complex may be composed of a hydrophobic interface of BA in parallel with a hydrophilic contact via electrostatic forces between positively charged M2 AH and negatively charged TUDCA. Thus, TUDCA reorganization of the M2 protein deforms the liposomal construct of iVLPm1-2, shown as strings of membranous debris. As binding features of BA usually appear above millimolar concentrations [37] , this may explain the high doses of TUDCA required in this study.",
