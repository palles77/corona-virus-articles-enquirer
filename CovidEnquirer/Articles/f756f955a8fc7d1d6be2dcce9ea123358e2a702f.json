Clinical toxoplasmosis is most severe in transplacentally infected or neonatally infected kittens; the type and severity of clinical illness depend on the degree and localization of tissue injury. The organism infects the gastrointestinal epithelium and disseminates through the blood. Intracellular replication of T. gondii tachyzoites results in destruction of infected cells and necrosis. Replication is common in hepatocytes and the pancreas and can result in hyperbilirubinemia from either hepatic disease or pancreatic disease. Hepatic disease seems to be uncommon in chronically infected cats. Clinical signs in acutely infected cats include anorexia, depression, fever, abdominal distension, crying. dyspnea, central nervous system signs, icterus, and death.",

Fecal examination for T. gondii oocysts may be beneficial 1-2 weeks after initial exposure. Serologic testing has become the most practical and accepted means of diagnosing T. gondii infection. Serologic evidence of recent or active infection consists of high IgM titers, or a fourfold or greater increase in IgG titers. However, these findings document only recent infection, not clinical disease due to infection.",

PIP can manifest as either effusive (wet) or noneffusive (dry), depending on predominant type (humoral or cell-mediated) and efficacy of the host's immune response (see Chapter 38). Hyperbilirubinemia has been associated most commonly with the noneffusive form of PIP. A primary mechanism for hyperbilirubinemia due to PIP is the formation of perivascular pyogranulomas within the hepatic parenchyma and bile duct system severe enough to cause either synthetic liver failure, intrahepatic biliary obstruction, or extrahepatic biliary obstruction. In addition, the hyperbilirubinemia associated with PIP can result from hepatic lipidosis induced by anorexia. The definitive diagnosis of hepatic involvement with the PIP virus requires a liver biopsy to document the characteristic lesions and to perform immunohistochemistry. Classical lesions include perivascular infiltration (arterioles and venules) of proliferating macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells. and neutrophils. Treatment responses are variable and prognosis is guarded.",
