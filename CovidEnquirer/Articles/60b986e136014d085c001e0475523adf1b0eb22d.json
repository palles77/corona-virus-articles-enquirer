In a survey of more than 7500 autopsies of children performed between 1917 and 1967, Dehner and Kissane3 found only three neonates with multiple, small, pyogenic hepatic abscesses, whereas a review of approximately 4900 autopsies4 performed at Los Angeles Children's Hospital between 1958 and 1978 revealed 9 such infants.' Among 175,000 neonates admitted between 1957 and 1977 to Milwaukee Children's Hospital, 2 died with hepatic microabscesses6; 3 such patients were seen among 83,000 pediatric patients admitted to New York Hospital between 1945 and 1983,7 and 1 was reported at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston between 1963 In three infants, the abscesses were described as \"~t e r i l e . \"~~*~~~~~ Although one of these infants had received penicillin for 9 days before surgical drainage, it is possible that in all three cases the abscesses were caused by anaerobic bacteria that failed to grow under standard conditions of transport and indicate infection with anaerobes, a frequent cause of liver abscess in adults. 44 The most common cause of intrauterine bacterial hepatitis, congenital listeriosis, characteristically involves the liver and adrenals (see Chapter 14).

The relative importance of each in the cause of this condition can be estimated from data collected in several large series. Among almost 400 newborns with peritonitis studied between 1959 and 1978, perforation of the intestinal tract was responsible for 72% of cases, with ruptured omphaloceles or gastroschisis responsible for 12%, hematogenous dissemination or \"primary\" peritonitis for 12%, and omphalitis and postoperative complications A comprehensive review of neonatal peritonitis by Bell describes common sites and causes of gastrointestinal perforation and their relative frequencies (Figs. 10-1 and 10-2).230, 243 No recent cases of neonatal peritonitis have been attributed to microorganisms entering the peritoneal cavity by traversing the bowel wall through the lymphatics or within macrophages (ie., transmural migration). Evidence for the existence of this pathway is theoretical and is based primarily on retrospective analyses of pathologic data in humans, together with supporting observations made on laboratory animals.265*279 Further confirmation is necessary before the transmural pathway can be accepted as an established source of peritoneal colonization by bacteria. peritoneal infection within the first 24 h o~r~.~~~~~~~~~~~~ An analysis of etiologic factors responsible for peritonitis in the newborn provides a ready explanation for this observation (see Table 10 -2). Most cases of NEC243,280 and spontaneous gastric perforation233,243~249~262 occur within the first week. Ruptured omphaloceles and gastroschisis often develop early infections, and in infants with congenital obstruction, the onset of alimentation during the first 12 to 24 hours accentuates distention and ischemic necrosis of the bowel wall, which leads to early intestinal perforation. Exchange transfusions are performed most frequently within the first 1 or 2 days of life and may be followed by enterocolitis within 4 to 24 hours in infants in whom perforation ultimately occurs.281s282 Neonatal sepsis, with potential peritoneal seeding of microorganisms, is more frequent during the first 48 hours of life than during any subsequent period.'\"'",

In controlled clinical trials, a significant reduction in the incidence of NEC in treated premature infants was shown in some,331,434-437 whereas in others, investigators were unable to demonstrate any protective Studies of v a n c~m y c i n~~~ have shown a significant reduction in NEC in high-risk infants. Previous studies revealed selective growth of resistant organisms in bowel flora331 ,438,440 and evidence of significant systemic absorption of aminoglycoside antibiotic^,^^^^^'.^^ suggesting that oral aminoglycoside prophylaxis is not free of potential risks. Potential risk factors, however, have not been examined in vancomycin trials. Until additional evidence is presented indicating clear-cut benefits from the use of oral aminoglycosides or vancomycin, it does not appear that either should be used routinely for prevention of NEC in premature infants. Epidemiologic evidence that early use of parented ampicillin and aminoglycoside therapy may delay or decrease the risk of NEC has not been confirmed in controlled studies. 343 Oral probiotics have been suggested to alter the bowel flora of the infant to reduce the incidence and severity of NEC. Infants fed breast milk and a product including Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis had a reduced incidence and severity of NEC compared with those of infants fed breast milk alone. 343a Excessive or accelerated feedings have been associated with increased frequency of endemic NEC,443 and some have recommended a schedule of slow advancement of daily feeding volumes limited to about 20 mL/kg/day. NEC infants are more likely to have been fed earlier, to have received fullstrength formulas sooner, and to have received larger feeding volumes and increments, and stress and associated respiratory problems may make such infants more vulnerable to NEC?45,309-3143M Prior studies of the use of a feeding regimen employing prolonged periods of bowel rest in high-risk infants has been successful in preventing NEC in some nurseries3I5 but totally without value in others.3173324 Later studies have added additional support for standardized feeding schedules in low-birth-weight infants (500 to 2500g); all have used maximum volumes no greater than 20mL/kg/day, with feeding beginning at 24 to 72 hours after birth, depending on birth weight and gestational age.325s326 Both synthetic formulas and breast milk have been successful. Carrion and EganM5 have suggested that relative hypochlorhydria of the neonate may contribute to NEC and found that hydrochloric acid supplements (0.01 to 0.02 1.0 N HCVmL of formula) significantly reduced NEC rates and lowered gastric pH. Additional studies have shown that standardized feedings begun at a median of 4 days after onset of NEC can be associated with an abbreviated time until institution of full enteral feedings, a reduced incidence of the use of central catheters and catheter infections, and ultimately, a shorter hospital stay.* Many NEC \"epidemics\" in neonatal intensive care units, lasting 2 weeks to 7 months, have been reported from centers worldwide. 343, 35435, 447, 448 Although the microbiologic agents associated with these outbreaks have varied, institution of strict infection control measures was often useful in bringing about a significant decrease in the incidence of NEC; the reasons for success are less clear. However, results have been sufficiently impressive to recommend that enforcement of bedside enteric precautions, together with cohorting of infants and staff, be instituted when two or more cases of NEC occur in a nursery.3233355,M9",

Long-term follow-up of low-birth-weight infants with severe NEC (i.e., Bell's stages I1 and 111) has documented higher rates of subnormal body weight (15% to 39%) and head circumference (30%) in addition to significant neurodevelopmental impairment (83%)?55 Clinical observations suggest that infants with bowel resection for NEC are at increased risk of sepsis, occurring from 1 week to 3 years (mean, 4 months) later. Almost all had had a central venous catheter in place for parented nutrition at the time of infection. Enteric bacilli were responsible for more than 40% of the bacteremias, whereas only 20% were caused by staphylococcal species, which are the usual causes of catheter sepsis.

Whether this mechanism or that of direct bacterial invasion is primarily responsible for valvulitis is not known. A similar pathogenesis has been postulated for formation of mycotic aortic aneurysms in newborn^.^^^^'^^^^^' Endocarditis should be suspected in any neonate, particularly a premature infant, with an indwelling vascular catheter, evidence of sepsis, and new or changing heart murmurs. When these findings are accompanied by persistent bacteremia or signs of congestive heart failure in the absence of underlying heart disease, the diagnosis must be considered seriously. Although Janeway's lesions,484 a generalized petechial r a~h , 4~~~~~,~~~ and splinter hemorrhage^^^ have been seen, murmurs characteristic of semilunar valve insufficiency, Osler's nodes, Roth's spots, arthritis, and other findings typical of valvular infection in adults and older children have not been observed in neonates. However, multiple septic emboli with involvement of the skin, bones, viscera, and central nervous system are relatively common findings.* Two-dimensional echocardiography has proved to be an invaluable rapid, noninvasive method for diagnosing though it cannot differentiate between infected and sterile vegetations and other valvular lesions (discussed later), imaging is quite specific, and falsepositive readings are uncommon. Unfortunately, less certainty can be placed on a negative report. Despite detection of vegetations with echocardiography as small as 2 mm, the number of false-negative examinations is ~i g n i f i c a n t~~~\"~~'~'~; in one series, two of three infants with thrombotic valvular lesions 3 to 7 mm in diameter had normal two-dimensional *See references 445,447,449,450,454-456,458-464,468,469,471 e~hocardiograms.4~~ A diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis should be considered in any infant with a compatible history and physical findings regardless of the results obtained by echocardiography. Widespread use of new techniques such as transesophageal echocardiography, which provides detailed views of the rnitral and tricuspid valves, and color flow Doppler imaging, which can identify areas of turbulence as blood passes over vegetations or through narrowed valve leaflets, may greatly improve diagnostic accuracy in the future. 515 When endocarditis is suspected, specimens of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine obtained by catheterization or suprapubic aspiration should be sent for bacterial and fungal culture. Because blood drawn from a central catheter often contains organisms colonizing the line but not necessarily present in the systemic circulation, at least two peripheral venous blood cultures should be obtained before antimicrobial therapy is initiated. Volumes of 1 to 5 mL, depending on the infant's sue, should be a d e q~a t e . '~ Routine laboratory studies are helpful in supporting a diagnosis of endocarditis in the newborn. The leukocyte count, differential count, and platelet count are usually indicative of sepsis rather than cardiac valve infection in particular. Microhematuria has been reported, although rarely.4M34m A chest radiograph should be obtained to determine signs of cardiac failure or pulmonary or pleural space infection. CT or MRI of the brain can be helpful in an infant with neurologic signs, particularly if left-sided endocarditis or a right-to-left shunt exists. Baseline determinations of inflammatory markers are useful and can be used for assessing the efficacy of the therapy; both the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level have been used.",

S. aureus was the most frequent isolate, with E. coli and Klebsiella sp. the next most common.

The lesion and the surrounding tissue should be cleaned with 70% ethanol to prevent contamination from organisms that colonize the surface. If crusts are present, they should be lifted with a sterile swab to provide drainage, and cultures should be obtained from the base of the lesion. Vesicles and pustules can be aspirated with a needle (20 to 25 gauge) attached to a syringe, or they can be opened and exudate collected on a sterile swab. In general, swabs are not preferred for specimen collection because swab materials bind or inactivate bacterial organisms. Aspiration of abscesses is important; more than one aspiration may be required because the suppurative focus may not be easily distinguished from the surrounding inflammatory tissue. Aspiration of the leading edge or point of maximal inflammation of an area of cellulitis may be of value and should be performed if no other suppurative or purulent sites are available for culture. A small needle (25 or 26 gauge) should be attached to a tuberculin or other smallvolume syringe fitled with 0.25 to 0.50mL of sterile nonbacteriostatic saline; the needle should be inserted into the area of soft tissue to be sampled, with continuous, gentle aspiration applied to the syringe. If no fluid is returned to the syringe, a small amount of fluid should be injected and immediately aspirated back into the syringe.
