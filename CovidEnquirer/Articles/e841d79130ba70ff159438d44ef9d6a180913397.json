Indeed, such \"health careeacquired\" infections in patients, other unintended errors, such as medication overdoses, and the known side effects of hazardous treatments have recently spawned the highly visible \"patient safety movement.\" 4 Less apparent, however, has been the risk to health that those same hazards and this same environment impose on the men and women who work there. 5 Although preventing exposure to infectious agents and musculoskeletal injuries resulting from patient lifting have been the primary focus of employee safety programs, the chemical hazards in health care have been more slowly recognized. These include novel agents, some of which are unique to health care such as sterilants, germicidal agents, and pharmaceuticals including the highly toxic anticancer drugs. Many of these drugs are themselves cancer-causing or toxic to human reproduction and have been the subject of environmental monitoring campaigns in recent years, showing widespread work-area contamination. 6 In the context of this highly complex and hazardous work environment, particular challenges arise in pursuing protections for health care workers in this unique employment sector. Biases within the health care industry and the safety and health community itself collude to limit both the awareness of hazards that do exist and the successful application of classical approaches used to assure safe jobs. 7 This occurs for several reasons.",

A number of excellent reviews of hazard management in the healthcare sector have been published 5,11-13 and the reader is directed to these resources. However, several overarching hazards require specific address, due both to their strategic threat to the global health workforce and because they are eminently preventable. Biologic Hazards, Airborne, and Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Biologic hazards are encountered in all health care settings and include airborne and bloodborne pathogens. Certainly the best-known airborne hazard is tuberculosis (TB), but other agents are also acquired by the airborne route, such as measles and severe acute respiratory syndrome and most recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome. Critical elements of an airborne hazard prevention plan are the early identification and isolation of patients as well as administrative and work practice controls to minimize exposure and disease transmission. 14 In the long arc of the unfolding of the HIV pandemic, one little-known development has been the unintended effect experienced by health care workers in some settings in southern Africa. Due to the endemicity of HIV infection in these regions, including among health care workers, and the often fatal collusion of TB infection in the already HIV infected, there have been alarmingly high TB infection rates and losses of life among nurses and other health workers. 15 Often, the typical TB prevention and treatment services afforded HIV patients may not be sought by HIV-infected health workers, due to the stigma they would experience with public knowledge of their HIV condition, which can occur when they line up for TB preventive treatment at the same clinics where they worked, for example. Because of this, the morbidity and mortality among workers was substantial, even as many of the countries in the region were already hobbled by a health worker shortage.",

Indeed, the WHO identifies the health care workforce as 1 of 6 essential pillars of its health system strengthening initiative. 10 Bloodborne pathogens, which include viruses capable of causing hepatitis or HIV infections continue to threaten health workers in both high-resource areas and in LMICs. 17 In developing countries, 40% to 65% of hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV) infections in health care workers were attributed to percutaneous occupational exposure. In industrialized countries, such infections rates are lower, with 8% to 27% of infections for HCV attributable to occupation and around 10% for HBV. These lower rates are due to immunization and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The range of HIV infections related to occupational exposure is estimated at 0.5% to 11%. 18 The likelihood of infection occurring after a percutaneous exposure has been observed to occur in a specific order with HBV infections (18%-30%) > HCV (1.8%) > HIV infections (0.3%) displaying generally a 10-fold difference in infection likelihood between each of these agents. [18] [19] [20] [21] Health workers are at risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens while performing routine duties involving the use of \"sharps\" such as injection needles and from unsafe sharps disposal. The WHO has many resource guides to protect health workers from exposure to bloodborne viruses, the elements of which include: 1) the use of \"universal or standard\" precautions-a system of work practices and behaviors that minimizes exposure such as prohibition of manual needle recapping after use and safe sharps disposal; 2) availability of hepatitis B immunization for health workers; 3) use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and apparel such as use of gloves; and 4) post-exposure management (including prophylaxis, where appropriate) counseling, and support. 22 ",

This approach has achieved success across many industrial settings. 30 In most cases, the elements of this hierarchy can be applied to the health care setting (Fig. 1) .",

However, engineering solutions often are the most costly type of hazard control. In resource-limited settings where engineering controls are unaffordable or otherwise not feasible, scrupulous use of work practices that minimize aerosol and dust generation along with administrative controls that limit personnel access to areas where hazards are encountered can minimize exposure. Figure 1 displays this upside-down hierarchy approach. Importantly, the lack of resources for the more costly elements of a hazard control approach does not relieve the facility from responsibility from applying some of the control measures that are available to make the work setting the most safe it can be, even in the setting of resource constraints.",
