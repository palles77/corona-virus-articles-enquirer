This possibility became a reality in October 2001 when someone sent spores of Bacillus anthracis to media companies in New York City and Boca Raton, Florida, resulting in five deaths, considerable panic throughout the United States and other countries, and raised the awareness of our vulnerability. There are more than 1400 species of infectious organisms that are known to be pathogenic for humans; many additional organisms are capable of causing disease in animals or plants. Realistically, only a few of these infectious agents pose serious problems or are capable of affecting human, animal, or plant health on a large scale. Even fewer of these agents are viruses. Viruses that could be used as weapons against humans, animals, or plants generally possess traits including ease of production and dissemination, transmissibility, environmental stability, and high morbidity and mortality rates.",

Furthermore, terrorists can be distinguished from other types of criminals by their motivation and objective; however, criminals may also be driven by psychological pathologies and may use biological agents.

            "text": "The use of viral agents for biological warfare has a long history, which predates their recognition and isolation by culture. Their early use is consistent with what, at the time, was known about infectious diseases, particularly smallpox. In the sixteenth century, the Spanish explorer, Francisco Pizarro, presented the indigenous peoples of South America with variola-contaminated clothing, which resulted in widespread epidemics of smallpox. During the French and Indian War (1745-67), Sir Jeffrey Amherst, commander of the British forces in North America, suggested the deliberate use of smallpox to 'reduce' Native American tribes hostile to the British. Captain Ecuyer (one of Amherst's subordinates), fearing an attack on Ft. Pitt from Native Americans, acquired two variola-contaminated blankets and a handkerchief from a smallpox hospital and, in a gesture of good will, distributed them to the Native Americans. As a result, several outbreaks of smallpox occurred in various tribes in the Ohio River valley. In 1775, during the Revolutionary War, the British attempted to spread smallpox among the Continental forces by inoculating (variolation) civilians fleeing Boston. In the South, there is evidence that the British were going to distribute slaves who had escaped during hostilities, and were sick with smallpox, back to the rebel plantations in order to spread the disease.",

Allegations have been made by the government of Cuba that the CIA was responsible for the massive outbreaks of swine fever in 1971 and dengue fever in 1980 that ravaged the country. However, subsequent investigations have failed to find substantive proof of CIA involvement in these outbreaks. The Aum Shinrikyo, a religious cult responsible for the 1995 release of sarin gas in the Tokyo subway system, was also involved in biological warfare activity and sent a team of 40 people to Zaire to acquire Ebola virus. Fortunately, they were unsuccessful in this endeavor. In 1997, unknown farmers in New Zealand deliberately and illegally introduced rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (a calicivirus) onto the south island as an animal control tool to kill feral rabbits.",

            "text": "Over the past two decades, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been involved in a number of biocrimes. This most likely reflects the availability of HIVcontaminated blood as a source of this virus. For example, in 1990, Graham Farlow, an asymptomatic HIV-positive inmate at a prison in New South Wales, Australia, injected a guard with HIV-contaminated blood. The guard became infected with HIV; Farlow subsequently died of AIDS. In 1992, Brian T. Stewart, a phlebotomist at a St. Louis, MO hospital, injected his 11-month-old son with HIVcontaminated blood during a fight over payment of child support. In 1993, Iwan E. injected his former girlfriend with 2.5 ml of HIV-contaminated blood after she broke up with him. In 1994, Dr. Richard J. Schmidt, a married Louisiana gastroenterologist, injected a former lover with HIVcontaminated blood. Molecular typing of the HIV strains demonstrated that she contracted the same strain of HIV as found in one of Dr. Schmidt's patients. In perhaps the most famous case, Dr. David Acer, a Florida dentist infected with HIV, transmitted the disease to six of his patients between 1987 and 1990. The intentional infection of these patients is a possibility although there is no direct evidence. In spite of these incidents, HIV has not been included on lists of threat agents for public health bioterrorism preparedness. However, some contend that HIV has great weapon potential if the goal is to destabilize a society.",

In 1999, an article appeared suggesting that the CIA was investigating whether Iraq was responsible for causing the outbreak of West Nile fever in the New York City area. The story relied heavily on a previous story written by an Iraqi defector, claiming that Saddam Hussein planned to use West Nile virus strain SV 1417 to mount an attack. The investigation indicated that there was no known evidence of bioterrorism involved in the spread of West Nile virus. A fictional 'virus' was also involved in one of the largest bioterrorism hoaxes in 2000. According to e-mail messages widely circulated on the Internet, an organization known as the Klingerman Foundation was mailing blue envelopes containing sponges contaminated with a fictional pathogen called the 'Klingerman virus'. According to the e-mail alert, 23 people had been infected with the virus, including 7 who died.",

A report for the United Nations on chemical and biological weapons and the effects of their possible use gave estimates on the numbers of casualties produced by a hypothetical biological attack (Table 1) . Three viruses (Rift Valley fever virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Venezuelan Equine Encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus) were evaluated in a scenario in which 50 kg of the agent was released by aircraft along a 2 km line upwind of a population center of 500 000. The viral agents produced fewer casualties and impacted a smaller area when compared with the bacterial agents used in this hypothetical model. Of note, smallpox was apparently not evaluated because it had not yet been eradicated and level of vaccine-induced immunity in the population was high.",

VEE virus was stockpiled by both countries as an incapacitating agent; Variola major and Marburg viruses were stockpiled as lethal agents by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union reportedly conducted a live field test of Variola major virus on Vozrozhdeniye Island in the Aral Sea in the 1970s, in which 400 g of the virus was released into the atmosphere by explosion. Unfortunately, a laboratory technician who was collecting plankton samples from an oceanographic research vessel 15 km from the island became infected. It was reported that after returning home to Aralsk, she transmitted the infection to several people including children. All those infected died. A number of other viruses that infect humans (e.g., Ebola virus, Lassa fever virus, enterovirus 70) or livestock (e.g., foot and mouth disease virus, rinderpest, Newcastle disease virus) have also been studied for their offensive capabilities or for the development of medical and veterinary countermeasures. Today, with the increased level of concern, a number of viruses have been cited as possible weapons for use against humans or animals ( Table 2 ). The requirements for an ideal biological warfare agent include availability, ease of production, stability after production, a susceptible population, absence of specific treatment, ability to incapacitate or kill the host, appropriate particle size in aerosol so that the virus can be carried long distances by prevailing winds and inhaled deeply into the lungs of unsuspecting victims, ability to be disseminated via food or water, and the availability of a vaccine to protect certain groups.

The target for an attack with a viral agent can range from humans to animals and plants. Therefore, agricultural targets are also a major concern. Nature has provided many challenges to combating viral diseases. Viral agents are much more prone to genetic variation and mutation, and can be manipulated or created in the laboratory to take on desired characteristics. Differentiating between natural and intentional viral disease outbreaks can be challenging. Unlike bacterial diseases, many of which are treatable, there are fewer medical countermeasures to employ when dealing with viral infections. Laboratory diagnostic methods and reagents must continuously be refined to account for genetic changes and variants. Thus, the challenge of developing bioterrorism countermeasures is significant. Fortunately, this effort contributes to combating natural disease events more effectively, which has global benefits.",

Carrier state Persistent infection of a host cell by a virus, with the surviving host persistently carrying and continually producing virus without entering a lysogenic state. Circular permutation A change in the sequence of the linear DNA termini that does not alter the relative sequence (e.g., circular permutation of ABCDEFGH could generate BCDEFGHA, CDEFGHAB, etc). Concatamer Two or more DNA molecules that are linked together to form a long, linear DNA molecule. Cured A host cell that was once a lysogen, but no longer carries viral DNA in any form. Halophilic Having a requirement for an environment with a high salt concentration. Headful packaging The mechanism of packaging viral DNA based on the size of the virus head, rather than the length of the viral genome. Hyperthermophile Having a requirement for an environment with a high temperature (>80 C).Insertion sequences Repetitive sequences of DNA that can move from one site to another within the viral DNA. Integrase/recombinase An enzyme which can integrate viral DNA into the genome of its host cell. Lysogen A host cell that has been infected by a virus that remains dormant, despite the presence of viral DNA. Lytic virus A virus that is able to infect a host, replicate, and subsequently leave the host cell by rupturing (lysing) the host cell. Methanogenic Having the ability to produce methane. Monovalent A virus that has a host range limited to one species. Prophage A virus that is dormant within the host cell. Protein-primed replication Replication of DNA via the interaction of the DNA polymerase with specific proteins, rather than DNA or RNA primers. Temperate virus A virus that is able to infect a host, but remain dormant within the host cell. Terminal redundancy Linear DNA with the same sequence at each end. Transduction The transfer of host DNA from one host cell to another by a virus. Transfection The introduction of pure viral genomic DNA into a host cell, producing viable virus.",
