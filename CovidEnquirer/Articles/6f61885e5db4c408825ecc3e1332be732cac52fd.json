The impact of respiratory virus copathogens on influenza disease is unclear. We sought to determine if respiratory virus co-infection with pandemic H1N1 altered clinical disease. Methods: Respiratory samples from 229 and 267 patients identified with and without H1N1 influenza respectively were screened for the presence of 13 seasonal respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR. Disease severity between coinfected and monoinfected H1N1 patients were quantified using a standardized clinical severity scale. Influenza viral load was calculated by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Thirty (13.1%) influenza samples screened positive for the presence of 31 viral copathogens. The most prominent copathogens included rhinovirus (61.3%), and coronaviruses (16.1%). Median clinical severity of both monoinfected and coinfected groups were 1. Patients coinfected with rhinovirus tended to have lower clinical severity (median 0), whereas non-rhinovirus co-infections had substantially higher clinical severity (median 2). No difference in H1N1 viral load was observed between coinfected and monoinfected groups. Conclusions: Respiratory viruses co-infect patients with influenza disease. Patients coinfected with rhinovirus had less severe disease while non-rhinovirus co-infections were associated with substantially higher severity without changes in influenza viral titer.",

            "text": "Respiratory tract disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world accounting for approximately 4 million deaths worldwide. 1, 2 While viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus are well described as major respiratory pathogens, advancements in molecular and genomic techniques have increased detection and identification of new respiratory viruses. 3e11 There is also renewed attention on respiratory viruses including the human rhinovirus and coronaviruses as there is mounting evidence that these viruses can also lead to clinically severe disease. 5,12e18 Currently, the majority of practitioners approach respiratory viral infections assuming a single-agent etiology. However, our group and others have realized that a substantial number of patients with respiratory tract disease have more than one viral pathogen. 19e21 The frequency of respiratory virus co-infections varies widely in the literature but is often reported between 10 and 20% 22e25 and in one report as high as 60%. 26 This is understandable as many respiratory viruses circulate at similar times often with a winter time predominance in temperate climates. Recently, Brunstein et al. provided statistical evidence that co-infection with certain pathogens occurs more frequently than expected if co-infection was random. 25 Influenza has often been identified with co-infecting viruses. 20 Several groups speculate that early spread of influenza may be altered by co-circulation of traditional seasonal viruses. 27e30 There is increasing evidence in the literature for the importance of polymicrobial infections. Virusevirus interactions have been recognized both directly, indirectly and through immunological interactions. 31 Yet the clinical relevance of respiratory virus copathogens in association with disease is unclear. Several studies have reported viral coinfections being associated with increased morbidity. These studies show greater hospitalization rates and admission to intensive care associated with co-infection. 24, 32, 33 However, this remains controversial as several other reports describe co-infections having no increase in patient morbidity. 13,23,34e38 One explanation for the disagreement is the assumption that disease severity associated with dual infection is independent of the copathogen involved. Aberle et al. found that dual infections with rhinovirus and RSV was associated with reduced IFN-g response and a more severe clinical course than other co-infection combinations. 22 In animal models, specific dual respiratory infections resulted in either enhanced clinical manifestations or viral interference. 39e41 These findings suggest certain copathogen pairings may be more clinically relevant than others.",

This is one of the first investigations to quantify clinical severity of influenza disease based on specific copathogens. Our co-infection rate of 13.1% is similar to those reported in other studies. 24, 38, 42 Difference in patient population, time of sample collection, selection of pathogens to be screened and screening methodologies all contribute to variance in co-infection rates between studies.

Yet a growing number of reports now challenge this notion. 16e18 Rhinovirus co-infections have been associated with worse disease when co-infecting with RSV. 13 Our findings demonstrate this is not true regarding influenza. Rhinovirus co-infection had little impact on influenza disease, in fact they had milder findings in several key areas. The opposite was true in patients with coronavirus/ influenza co-infection. Comparable to other studies, 38, 42 we observe the total number of influenza and coronavirus co-infections is low (1.12%). But we find that the resulting disease was substantially more severe. This highlights the importance of recognizing respiratory virus pairings as distinct clinical entities. Viral interference of seasonal viruses (especially rhinovirus) with pandemic influenza has been suggested recently. Much of this is based on surveillance and inferred relationships of rhinovirus and influenza detection. 27 However our study demonstrates that influenza viral titer was not altered by viral co-infection suggesting that obstruction of influenza growth, either directly or indirectly, is not occurring. Explanation as to why disease severity was altered without changes in viral titer may lie in the resulting immunologic response. Investigation of host cytokine and cellular response associated with co-infections is a logical next step.",

Advancing molecular modalities including MassTag PCR, ViroChip and Deep sequencing will ultimately provide a more complete picture of co-infection frequency. It has been well described that severe clinical illness in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was associated with underlying co-morbidities including obesity, diabetes, or pregnancy. Collection and screening of samples as well as the use of the clinical severity score were independent of any patient's underlying co-morbidities. In addition to patient co-morbidities, the severity of illness may also be associated to other factors, such as delayed medical attention and lack of antiviral therapy.

This may explain some differences in our findings compared to similar studies. 38 Furthermore, while we point out that disease severity likely depends on the type of the co-infecting pathogen, the numbers of certain codetected pathogens in the H1N1 infected patients are too small for more detailed analysis. Continued investigation over multiple seasons will be required to answer these questions. Despite these limitations, we demonstrate that clinical relevance of influenza viral co-infection varies greatly and may be associated with the co-infecting pathogen involved. The recognition of respiratory viral co-infections is increasing with advancement of sensitive multiplex screening of respiratory samples. As the sensitivity of diagnostic methods increase, the number of viral co-infections will continue to rise.
