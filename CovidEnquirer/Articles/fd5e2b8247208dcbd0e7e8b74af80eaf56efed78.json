The term \"nanotechnology\" deals with small-sized materials when the size is down to subnanometer or several hundred nanometers [3] . The controlled synthesis and tuning properties of nanomaterials require knowledge of different disciplines such as physics, chemistry, electronics, computer science, biology, engineering, agriculture, etc. that may lead to the emergence of novel and multifunctional nanotechnologies. In this context, the exciting properties of nanomaterials have attracted the world scientific community toward their application in various sectors such as health, food, security, transport, and information technology, etc. The intelligent use of nanomaterials is predicted to enhance the performance of biomolecular electronic devices with high sensitivities and detection limits.",

            "text": "Diagnostics is clinically important both for identification of a disease and therapeutics. Early diagnostics plays an important role to detect a disease (prevention) or the outcome of a disease (prognosis). A number of biodevices have been fabricated for studies of blood gas, glucose/lactate/cholesterol, nucleic acid sequence analysis, proteins/peptides, combinatorial synthesis, toxicity monitoring, immunoassays, environment, defense, and forensic analysis. A biosensor for blood glucose monitoring has been successfully commercialized ( Fig. 1.1.1 ). Efforts are being made to enhance the resolution, accuracy, and miniaturization of biosensors for detection of biomolecules along with microfluidics and sample preprocessing [4] . Because of their portability, the short time to obtain results, biosensors have been predicted to fulfill a number of unmet needs in the diagnostics industry. Microfluidic biosensing devices offer important opportunities for research, especially for clinical diagnosis, due to their numerous advantages. The length scale indicating the size of nanomaterials in comparison to various biological components is shown in Fig. 1.1.2 . Atoms are the basic building blocks of nature [3] . The size of an atom is measured in angstrom: 10 \u00c010 m or 0.1 nm which is comparable with the Bohr radius (0.5 nm). Two atoms provide a molecule, e.g., fullerene contains 100 atoms. The quantum effect is an important factor for the size of a semiconductor particle. The Bohr radius of a particle can be defined as a b \u00bc \u03b5a 0 m m \u00c3 ; \u03b5 is a dielectric constant of a material, m is the rest mass of the electron, m* is the particle mass, and a 0 is the Bohr radius. A 1 mm-sized cube crystal of salt can contain w10 19 atoms or more, thus a bulk material can be made by a number of atoms. Similarly, the building blocks of living organisms are cells (size 1 mm) that consist of thousands of small and large molecules that are much larger than a NP.",

In bulk semiconductor materials, the radius of electron mobility is known to be higher than the Bohr exciton radius, with the result that mobility is not disturbed or not confined. The quantum confinement effect can be found when the size of the particle is too small to be comparable with the wavelength of the electron. When a particle size of a material becomes too small or comparable with Bohr exciton radius the electron mobility is confined. The electrons and holes are thus squeezed into small particles resulting in \"quantum confinement\" of the electron-hole pairs. The confinement means restricting the motion of randomly moving electrons to specific energy levels (discreteness). If a particle is of nanoscale dimensions the confining dimensions make energy levels discrete and this will increase or widen the material band gap or energy gap ( Fig. 1.1.4) . When the size of a particle becomes nearly Bohr exciton radius, the excitonic transition energy, blue shift in the absorption, and luminescence band gap energy increases due to the quantum confinement effect.",

The electrons and holes (charge carries) are confined and are free to transfer to the 2D state in a quantum well. The quantum well consists of a greater density of electronic states locate the edges of the conduction and valence bands than in bulk materials. The density of electron states in 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D (bulk) semiconductor structure is shown in Fig. 1 levels. The quantum confinement effect for quantum dots and wires can be calculated by using a simple effective-mass approximation model. Considering that the barriers have an infinite confining potential, it is possible to predict the confined energy level for nanostructured materials by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation [12] .

Besides this, attrition and pyrolysis have been used. In particular to pyrolysis, a vaporous liquid or gas precursor is forced by an orifice at high pressure and is burnt. Pyrolysis often results in aggregates and agglomerates rather than single primary particles. Interestingly, the chemical route for the synthesis of NPs has been developed which includes the solegel technique. These materials possess many attractive properties ascribed to the high volume fraction of interfacial structures. The studies have been extended to form nanocomposites with synergistic properties. Additionally, nanostructured powders such as titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, etc. were obtained by using a flame pyrolysis process have led to commercial products. NPs, through colloidal chemistry in liquid environments, involve numerous processes in nature (e.g., the fabrication of water glass). Colloidal solution is representative of NPs stabilized in solution so as to stop aggregation. Usually, the stabilization happens due to absorption of electric charges on the surface, leading to repulsion of the NPs providing a critical distance.

The main component in a biosensor is a bioreceptor or biologically derived sensing element that is either intimately connected or integrated with a physicochemical transducer [23] . The function of a biosensor is to produce a digital electronic signal that is directly proportional to the concentration of a target biomolecules. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry definition, \"a biosensor is a self-contained integrated device that is capable of providing specific quantitative or semi-quantitative analytical information using a biological recognition element (receptor) which is in direct spatial contact with a transducer element\" [24] . In 1962, Clark and Lyons first fabricated an electrochemical biosensor by immobilizing glucose oxidase (GOD) enzyme molecules on the surface of an oxygen electrode to detect glucose concentration [25] . In the presence of GOD, glucose is converted to gluconic acid and produces two electrons and two protons resulting in a reduction of GOD (oxidized). Again, electrons, protons, oxygen, and reduced GOD react to produce hydrogen peroxide and GOD (oxidized). The increased hydrogen peroxide or reduction of oxygen content can be correlated with the glucose quantity.",

In addition to bioreceptor molecules, a transducer is an essential component that converts a biochemical signal to electronic signal by interaction of the bioreceptors with target analytes. The generated signal can be directly or inversely proportional to the concentration of a desired analyte. The transducer elements could be electric current, electric potential, intensity and phase of electromagnetic radiations, mass, conductance, impedance, temperature, viscosity, etc. A schematic diagram of a typical biosensor is shown in Fig. 1 .2.7. The output signal generated by a transducer can be digitized by a signal-conditioning circuit to real-time display in a liquid-crystal display monitor with the help of a microcontroller. There are three generations of biosensors. The electrode proposed by Clark in 1962 is known as first generation of biosensor, and this is oxygen dependent (Table 1. 1.2) . In this case, the product generated due to reaction can diffuse to the transducer resulting in an electrical signal. In the second generation, the biosensors do not require oxygen but need a specific mediator between the reaction and transducer to improve the response signal. In the third generation of biosensors, the reaction itself can cause the response signal, and no mediator is directly involved. 1959 Rosalyn Sussman Yalow (born 1921) and Solomon Aaron Berson (1918e72) developed the radioimmunoassay (RIA) which allows the very sensitive determination of hormones such as insulin based on an antigeneantibody reaction. Today the RIA technology is surpassed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay because the colorimetric or fluorescent detection principles are favored over radioactivity-based technologies.",

In an amperometric biosensor, on application of potential, the current (typically nA to mA range) due to catalytic conversion or the absorption of proteins that occurs at the electrode surface is measured. [43] . 3. Impedimetric and Capacitive: These techniques are label-free techniques and can be utilized for quantification of biomolecular interactions such as enzymatic, DNA hybridization, antigeneantibody and proteineprotein interactions. A target biomolecule, when it reacts with a specific bioreceptor on sensor surface, the changes in the dielectric constant or resistance can result exclusively due to the presence of the target molecules. Thus, there is no label required for impedance sensing, which is beneficial for protein detection for the construction of third-generation biosensors. The electrical impedance is the measure of the resistance that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied. It can be defined as the ratio of the voltage to the current in a given frequency domain. Impedance biosensors measure the electrical impedance generated on electrode/electrolyte interface in the alternating current (AC) steady-state under constant direct current (DC) bias conditions. In an electrochemical cell, various phenomena such as kinetics of antigeneantibody interactions, redox reactions, and other molecular interactions at the electrode surface can be considered to impede the flow of electrons in a typical AC circuit for impedance analysis. Usually, impedance is demonstrated as a complex number, where the ohmic and capacitive reactance have the real and imaginary components, respectively. To represent electrochemical impedance data are the Nyquist and Bode plots are widely used. In a typical Nyquist plot, the imaginary component (Z 00 , out of phase) is plotted versus the real component (Z 0 , in phase) by varying frequencies. But in a Bode plot, the logarithm of the absolute impedance, jZj, and the phase shift (4) of the impedance are displayed versus the logarithm of the applied frequency. Capacitive biosensors utilize the change in dielectric properties at the electrolyteeelectrode interfaces due to the interaction of biomolecules. An ideal capacitor has the capacity to store charge, and thus the electric capacitance can be expressed as",

            "text": "The voltammetric techniques measure the current in a pulsed manner (current due to charging or non-Faradaic) by changing the potential. With an applied potential in between WE and RE, the exchange of electrons occurs between the WE and the electroactive species. Charging and discharging at the electrode due to the formation of electrical double layer are responsible for change in the potential difference resulting in the introduction of capacitance (charging). For diffusion controlled reactions, while a Faradaic current decays with t \u00c01/2 , the capacitive current for the same reactions can decay exponentially over time. By sampling the currents at the end of applied pulses, we can achieve significant Faradaic currents with a negligible capacitive current. Thus, the sensitivity of the voltammetric technique can be significantly increased, and the measured current is due to the Faradaic reaction of interest. The pulse amplitude, pulse width, and sampling period are known as important parameters for all pulse voltammetry techniques. The normal pulse voltammetry (NPV) tool utilizes a series of potential pulses with increasing amplitude (Fig. 1.3.5A) . In this technique, current is quantified at the end of each pulse where the charging current is negligible. It is usually conducted in an unstirred electrolyte using solid electrodes. The duration of the pulse (t) is about 1e100 ms, and the interval between the pulses remain about 0.1e5 s. The output signal is the sampled current displayed on the y-axis with respect to the potential to which the pulse is stepped on the x-axis. The output voltammogram has a sigmoidal shape as shown in Fig. 1.3 .5B. The limiting current (i l ) of an NPV is given by",

The wave form of input and output potential for DPV is shown in Fig. 1.3 .6A and consists of small pulses with a constant amplitude (w10e100 mV). In DPV, each pulse of potential superimposes with changing base potential. The current is sampled twice for each pulse of period, first at the beginning of the applied pulse and second at the ending of the same pulse, and the difference between these two current values is displayed and plotted against the base potential. The selection of sampling points will allow for the decay of the non-Faradaic current. The output signal of DPV is shown in Fig. 1.3 .6B. The current measured in DPV is much higher than NPV resulting in higher sensitivity of DPV with respect to NPV. Fig. 1.3 .7C.

For example, a microfluidic-based nucleic acid biosensor has been developed using impedance spectroscopic technique for quantification of DNA sequences specific to chronic myelogenous leukemia (Fig. 1.4.3A) . In this microfluidic sensor, the cadmium selenide quantum dots were deposited on a patterned conductive electrode via the LangmuireBlodgett technique for detection of the target complementary DNA concentration by measuring the interfacial charge transfer resistance (R ct ) via hybridization [52] . Increasing concentrations of complementary DNA followed by DNA hybridization can result in the double-stranded DNA helix formation on the sensor surface that increases the negative charge of the electrode surface and hence decreasing R ct (Fig. 1.4.3B) . A selective, reproducible, and sensitive immunosensor [53] has been developed using antibody-functionalized reduced graphene oxide sheets for detection of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) molecules via the impedance method ( Fig. 1.4.4) . The antiapolipoproteinfunctionalized reduced graphene oxide platform was found to be highly sensitive to LDL molecules, and the variation of the impedance signal with increasing LDL molecules causes adsorption of LDL via antigeneantibody interactions.",

An optical transducer can be integrated with a source of light and converts a biological event to electronic signal. In optical biosensors, the transduction process induces the change in the absorption, transmission, reflection, refraction, phase, amplitude, frequency, or polarization of light in response to the physical/chemical change created by the biorecognition events. The optical biosensors can also be fabricated using SPR, fluorescence, biochemi/luminescence, Raman scattering, and refractive index (RI). A light source (light-emitting diode, laser, etc.), an optical transmission media (waveguide, fiber, etc.), a bioreceptor (enzymes, antibodies, or microbes), and an optical detection system are the main components of an optical biosensor. The classification of optical biosensors is shown in Fig. 1 Optical biosensors have potential demand in environmental monitoring, food safety and quality maintain, biomedical research, and diagnostics. Detection of biomolecules (e.g., DNA, proteins, cells, etc.) and binding kinetics of interactions between proteins and DNA, cells, etc. by optical probes have been exploited in recent years. In 1980s, SPR and evanescent wavesebased techniques were applied for the investigation of biological and chemical interactions. After development of the first commercial optical biosensor (late 1980s), researchers published more than 3000 research papers relating to optical biosensors for pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries. These include ligand fishing, virology, bacteriology, epitope mapping, cell biology, cell adhesion, enzymatic analysis, signal transduction, nucleotideenucleotide, and nucleotideeprotein binding, etc. With recent advances, optical biosensors are employed for detection of smallmolecule binding to immobilized receptors in drug screening application.

Fluorescence is a three-stage process that can occur in particular molecules such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons or heterocycles known as fluorophores or fluorescent dyes. A fluorophore molecule can be predicted to respond to a specific stimulus or to confine within a specific region of a biomolecule.

Within this time, the fluorophore experiences conformational changes and can have multiple interactions at molecular levels. The energy of S 1 can partially be dissipated, providing a relaxed singlet excited state (S 2 ) where fluorescence emission originates. However, all molecules are not initially excited by absorption back to S 0 (ground state) by fluorescence emission. And collisional quenching, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) may occur to depopulate S 2 . In the third stage, after emission with a photon energy of hn em , the fluorophore returns to S 0 . A longer wavelength and lower energy can be achieved than the excitation photon hn em due to energy dissipation during the excited-state lifetime. The difference of excitation and emission energy such as hn ex \u00c0 hn em is known as Stokes shift.

When monochromatic, polarized light strikes to an interface between prism and buffer solution) from the side where the media has the maximum RI (prism), the light can be partly reflected and refracted toward the plane of the interface. Above a certain angle of the incidence, all of the light would be reflected with diminishing refracted light.

The labeled immunosensor measures a molecule attached to a receptor by optical, fluorescence, amperometric, and other detection. The produced electrochemical signal depends on the concentration of the electroactive species produced by the enzyme-catalyzed reaction that is influenced by the amount of labeled enzyme bound to the immunosensor. The uses of enzyme labels offer significant amplification in the output of immunosensor because the enzyme molecules can rapidly produce many detectable product leading to low limit of detection (LOD). The electrochemical tool for an immunosensor has many benefits such as high sensitivity and low cost. However, some of the disadvantages include depuration from bound label, washing and separation steps, increased complexity of the assay, etc. The nonspecific binding of an antibody with foreign molecules other than the target analytes is a major issue in immunosensors development. One of the major problems that has delayed the commercialization is the inability of integration and supporting accessories on a single format.",

            "text": "A nucleic acid or DNA sensor is a biosensor that functionalized a nucleic acid as the biodetection element on the surface of a transducer. Currently, DNA biosensor technologies are of much interest because of their rapid and lowcost recognition of specific DNA sequences. These technologies commonly depend on the immobilization of a single-strand oligonucleotide probe onto transducer surfaces which can be optical, electrochemical, or masssensitive. The probe DNA (pDNA) is specific to recognize the complementary DNA (called duplex) target sequence via hybridization, resulting in a change in the measurable signal. Specific binding of the surface-confined ssDNA probe and its complementary DNA strand are translated into corresponding readout signals. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is known to be more specific than DNA for detection of biomolecular recognition. Structurally, PNA and DNA are almost similar, but the entire negatively charged sugare phosphate backbone of DNA is exchanged with a neutral (peptide-like) backbone having repeated N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine units associated with amide bonds. The adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine are the four natural bases found in DNA molecules. The amperometric, potentiometric, and impedimetric are the electrochemical techniques that have been employed for development of genosensors, whereas SPR, absorption, etc. are optical techniques for genosensors. CNTs, graphene, metal NPs, and nanocomposites and conducting polymers are the nanomaterials that are utilized for development of genosensors due to their larger surface area and biocompatibility with DNA molecules. Fig. 1.6 .0 shows the immobilization pDNA and hybridization of target DNA based on conducting polymer as an electrochemical transducer [61] .",

The critical point in the development of the modern cell-based biosensors is the immobilization of cells onto a transducer under cellular conditions. The whole cell biosensors are promising tools for detection of pollutants. The interactions between the living cells with organic substances (xenobiotics, heavy metals, changes in pH, etc.) in water, soil, and air could provide a desired measurable signal. Bacteria, algae, cyanobacteria, fungi, plant cell, protozoa, and other organisms can be utilized for the development of whole-cell biosensors.

Efforts have also been made to describe applications of nanostructured materials in biosensors. The inherent excellent properties of nanomaterials including 1D, 2D, and 3D nanostructures have been extensively employed for fabrication of biosensors. The biomolecules such as antibody, enzyme, ssDNA, or cells can be linked with nanostructured materials by enabling surface chemistry for the establishment of a suitable bionanointerface that can detect a minute concentration of specific interest of target molecules. The uses of nanomaterials in biosensor technology are well explored for point-of-care applications by researchers. The incorporation of nanomaterials in biosensors provides distinct improvement of biosensor characteristics including sensitivity, selectivity, fast response, and low cost. The next chapter deals with the synthesis of the nanomaterials such as metals, metal oxides, carbon, and polymeric nanostructures for biosensor applications.",

In a typical SPR, each measurement initiates with conditioning the sensor surface having a buffer solution (step 1). In this step, no change arises at the sensor and a baseline can be measured with the dip at the SPR angle (step 1,Fig. 1.5.0). The target biomolecules on the surface are captured on the surface due to specific interactions, providing a change in the RI and a shift in the SPR angle to position (step 2,Fig. 1.4.8). In this step, realtime adsorption kinetics of the target molecules can be monitored. Consequently, the injection of buffer solution onto the sensor can flush-off the nonspecifically bound molecules (step 3) called dissociation. And the dissociation kinetics can be measured in real time. In this step, accumulation of mass can be gained from the SPR response (DR). In step 4, introducing the regeneration solution (low pH buffer) breaks the specific binding between the target molecule analyte and bioreceptor on the sensor surface. If the regeneration is not complete, the remaining accumulated mass can cause the level at baseline to increase.The main advantage of SPR technique is the determination of real-time tracking and kinetics of biomolecular interactions.

Nanomaterials for Medical Technology: The applications of nanomaterials such as NPs in the medical field including point-of-care diagnostics, drug delivery, biomaterials, and imaging have led to increased interest[14]. The excellent water solubility of NPs can be utilized as a carrier for targeted drugs to the tumor sites for cancer therapeutics. Liposomes, nanogels, micelles and dendrimers, etc., are the building blocks for NPs due to their unique properties such as high degree of biodegradability, and effective endocytosis with the target cell. NPs are being investigated for the delivery of therapeutic agents, e.g., small molecule drugs, aptamer sequences, and antigenic proteins. The multifunctional NPs can be utilized as optical imaging agents for mapping of cancerous cells or as detection probes and other targeted biomolecules. Nanomaterials can be utilized for conjugation of the antibodies, proteins, bioactive molecules, peptides, and oligonucleotides to specifically determine target receptors on cancerous tumor cells.Fig. 1.2.1shows a schematic representation for interaction of the targeted NPs with a cell. The encapsulated NPs containing a chemotherapy drug can be targeted to the surface of cancer cells using cell-specific ligands. By recognizing specific receptors, NPs can bind to a surface cancer cell leading to internalization of the NPs by endocytosis. The NP inside the cell can undergo endosomal escape resulting in the release of drugs for treatment causing cell death (Fig. 1.2.2). An overview of nanomaterials application in different fields.
