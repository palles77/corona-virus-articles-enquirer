The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1991 proposed an additional category to Spaulding's classification as \"environmental surfaces\" to represent the surfaces that usually do not come in contact with patient. 13 Environmental surfaces can be further subgrouped as clinical contact surfaces (medical equipment or high-touch surfaces) and housekeeping surfaces. CDC defines clinical contact surfaces as the areas that act like reservoirs of microorganisms, e.g., hands of health care workers. High-touch surfaces such as telephone, light switch board, bedrails, computer, door handle, and medical equipment like ventilator, X-ray machines, and hemodialysis machines are the contacting equipment that subsequently contact the patient. CDC had issued guidelines for hand washing and hospital environmental control. Different LLDs and ILDs that can be used to disinfect the clinical contact surfaces were approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The housekeeping surfaces such as walls, floor, and sinks carry very low risk of transmission of infection. So, disinfection of such surfaces is less frequent in comparison to the previous one.",

The infection is usually mild, but sometimes it may become severe and life threatening. Majority of infection occur in the ICUs, nurseries, and surgical units. Additionally, with the increase in the length of stay, the treatment procedures become very expensive.

For example, HAI due to blood stream infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia increase the death rate as well as the extra cost due to hospital stay. It was estimated that death rate due to HAI is more than death rate due to AIDS, breast cancer, and road traffic accidents.

Ventilation helps in maintenance of the temperature and humidity. The OR's temperature should be kept 1\u00b0C lesser than the outside and maintained in between 18 and 24\u00b0C. About 40-60% of relative humidity should be maintained inside the ORs for the comfort of the staff.

The direction of air flow should remain from the ORs to the main corridor. It has been observed that turbulent air flow exchanges the air more efficiently than low-velocity unidirectional flow. The anesthetic gases should be removed other than the main exhaust. Filters with an efficiency of 20-40% are adequate at the entry side. HEPA filters, which can remove particles of size >0.3 \u03bcm with efficiency of >99.97% are used as the second-line filters near the ORs, ICUs, burn wards etc. Air from the HEPA filters flow unidirectionally (vertically or horizontally) causing few airborne bacteria at the operation site.

Various risk factors for the development of infections are divided into host-related and hospital-related factors. The host-related factors include severity of diseases, extreme of ages, immunocompromised conditions (malignancy/transplant/organ failure/HIV infection), burn injury, trauma, and extensive surgeries. The factors related to the hospital or treatment are device related, treatment on immunosuppressive drugs, multiple blood transfusion, hemodialysis, parenteral nutrition, prolong immobilization, etc. Since most of the infections are caused by the colonizers, the common pathogens isolated in these infections are MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing gramnegative bacteria, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, fluconazole-resistant Candida spp., etc.",

All the elements of the bundle must be executed at the same point of time.

Various recommendations for the prevention of VAP include (1) appropriate cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of ventilator equipment, (2) maintenance of ventilator circuits, and (3) routine care of patients requiring ventilation. 14 The cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of the equipment have been discussed earlier in the chapter. The preventive measures taken for the patients to reduce the rate of VAP are use of orotracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, minimization of the duration of ventilation. The patient should be maintained in semirecumbent position (30-45 degrees elevation of head of the bed). Regular oral care should be performed. CA-UTI is another common cause of infection in the ICUs 14 . Staff must be trained enough to differentiate asymptomatic bacteriuria from infection due to catheterization. Regular education regarding repeated hand washing before and after catheterization, maintenance of a closed system, maintaining free urine flow, and securing the catheter position correctly should be given to the health care workers for the prevention of these infections. SSI is a very common and life-threatening infection during ICU stays. 14 There are various evidence-based guidelines recommended by the CDC. Preoperative patient preparation, management of the colonizers, correct surgical technique, adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis, adequate sterilization and disinfection of the environmental surfaces, proper aseptic techniques, as well as washing surgical hands before and after the operative procedure are various preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the incidence of SSIs.",

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea due to C. difficile, and infection due to E. coli (O157:H7), Shigella spp., hepatitis A, rotavirus, etc., can be transmitted by contact with infected patients or items. Similarly infections transmitted by droplet such as tuberculosis, varicella, measles, viral hemorrhagic fever, and influenza can be prevented by taking adequate precaution. Use of antibiotics should be restricted in the ICU setup. Minimum precautions like heating the water before use, regular cleaning, and maintenance of water tanks can be done to prevent water-borne infections.",
