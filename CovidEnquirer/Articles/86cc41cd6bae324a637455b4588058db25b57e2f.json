The chromatographic separation was carried out on a ZORBAX SB-Aq column with a gradient mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 2 mM aqueous ammonium acetate.

Therefore, the deprotonated form of each compound, the [M\u2212H] \u2212 ion, was the parent ion in the Q1 spectra and used as the precursor ion to obtain Q3 product ion spectra. The MS/MS product ion spectra of the analytes and IS are shown in Fig. 2 . On the basis of that, to get the maximum response of precursor and product ions, the parameters for fragmentor voltage and collision energy were further optimized. Table 1 shows the optimal fragmentor voltage and collision energy of all the analytes. Finally, the most sensitive mass transition was monitored from m/z 269. The peak symmetry of the analytes greatly improved after adding ammonium acetate to the mobile phase. Thus, the concentration of ammonium acetate in aqueous phase was optimized from 1 to 10 mM, and the results showed that adding 2 mM ammonium acetate produced good improvement. In addition, a gradient elution program was used to reduce the retention time and eliminate excessive broadening of the chromatographic peaks. Finally, the optimized gradient elution mentioned in Section 2.2 was adopted.",

The method employed a simple and rapid extraction procedure for sample preparation, and offered higher sensitivity with little detectable coeluting endogenous substances requiring only 50 L plasma. This method is proposed for the pharmacokinetic study and preclinical monitoring of P. tomentosa.",
