HCV-229E viral RNA was detectable in the central nervous system tissue of 4 of 11 MS patients and in none of 6 neurological and 5 normal controls. No HCV-OC43 nucleic acid was detected in any of the specimens. These results suggest a neurotropism on the part of the 229E strain of human coronavirus and underline the importance of further studies on its tissue distribution.",

Even though the cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown, an environmental agent, particularly a virus, has been postulated on the basis of epidemiologic studies (1) . Human coronaviruses (HCV) number among potential pathogens due to the observation of coronavirus-like particles in the perivascular cuffing of an MS plaque (2) intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to HCV229E and HCV-OC43 in a proportion of MS patients (3) , and the isolation of coronavirus from two MS brains (4) . Also, murine coronaviruses serve as models of demyelinating diseases in rodents (5) thus HCVs may produce a similar pathology in humans. However, Sorensen et al. were unable to detect HCV-OC43 in four MS brains by classical molecular hybridization (6) . HCVs may be implicated in neurological diseases, particularly MS, either by persistent infection of oligodendrocytes or astrocytes (7, 8) or by some means of autoimmune stimulation such as molecular mimicry (9). Therefore an attempt should be made to detect very low concentrations of HCV RNA, characteristic of persistent infections, in tissues from patients with MS and other neurological disorders. Indeed, Murray et al. have recently detected murine-related coronavirus RNA and antigen in MS brains (70). In the present pilot study, we employed a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique to detect the RNA of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, the two strains of HCVs characterized and partially sequenced to date in frozen gray and white matter of MS patients and in the white matter of controls.

MS tissues were collected from identifiable plaques and adjacent or nonadjacent normal-appearing white matter and from gray matter (Montreal Brain Bank, Montreal, Quebec, and University Hospital, London, Ontario). Seven specimens of plaque tissue, 3 of gray matter, and 1 1 of white matter were collected from a total of 11 MS brains and 1 specimen of white matter each from individuals whose neuropathological report at autopsy indicated normality (five individuals), Alzheimer's disease (four patients), subacute meningoencephalitis of apparent bacterial origin (one patient), or ischemic vascular disease (one patient). RNA extracted from coded central nervous system (CNS) tissues was first tested for the presence of human myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA and human y-actin mRNA by RT-PCR to ensure that the RNA was sufficiently intact (1 I). Specimens in which mRNA could not be detected were excluded from the study. Total RNA was extracted from 50-to 300-mg frozen CNS tissue by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (12) modified such that processing was performed in Eppendot-f tubes and 10% of the extract was used for RT-PCR.",

            "text": "Recently, Murray et al. (10) reported the detection of coronaviruses in 12 of 22 MS brains by in situ hybridization using a probe derived from this group's MS isolate, which is more closely related to murine coronaviruses than to either HCV (23). It is important to note that, in the present study, we would not detect such nucleic acid in the event that it was present since the RT-PCR technique employed here is specific for HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 only. Indeed, our HCV-OC43 primers did not amplify MHV-A59 RNA (results not shown), whereas the HCV-OC43 probe used by Murray et al. (10) did hybridize weakly to it. Interestingly, our results on the detection of HCV-OC43 by RT-PCR are consistent with previous negative results with classical hybridization (6) . Surprisingly, an HCV-229E mRNA 7 probe used by Murray et al. (10) did not give any positive signals by in situ hybridization. This discrepancy with our positive results may be due to their preselection of tissues for the presence of murine-related coronavirus RNA, or to differences in the techniques used by our two groups. Given the existing murine coronaviral model for demyelinating disease it would be tempting to speculate about a possible role for HCV-229E in the etiology of MS, particularly in view of the ability of some coronaviruses to produce demyelination in primates (24). However, this is premature, considering that the mere presence of the virus does not necessarily indicate the existence of a causal relationship.",

Moreover, the estimated amount of viral RNA present in the clinical specimens (less than 10 pg/pg) correlates well with estimates made in the murine model where viral persistence in the CNS was observed after infection of the upper respiratory tract (27).

Primers for HCV-OC43 were 5'-CCCAAGCAAACTGCTACCTCTCAG-3 and 5'-GTAGACTCCGTCAATATCGGTGCC-3', corresponding to bases 215-238 and 497-520, respectively, on the mRNA coding for the nucleoprotein of HCV-OC43 (2 I). Oligonucleotide probes for hybridiza-tion with the amplification product were derived from sequences located between each pair of primers. of primers for HCV-229E (20). An oligonucleotide probe for hybridizing the amplification product of HCV-OC43 was 5'-GATGGCAACCAGCGTCAACTG-CTG-3' (bases 419-442) (2 7). The detectability level of our assay was evaluated as follows: the amplification product from human corona-virus RNA was treated with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and cloned into the Smal site of the pGEM 32 vector (Promega; Fisher, Mont&al, Quebec, Canada) by blunt-ended ligation (22). Five micrograms of HindIll-linearized plasmid was transcribed in vitro in the presence of 20 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.0); 4 mM MgCI,; 1 mM spermidine; 25 mM NaCl (transcription buffer; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); 0.4 mN1 (each) ATP, GTP, and UTP; 20 U T7 DNA polymerase, and 2 U RNase Block II (Stratagene) and 3 pM [a-32P]CTP. The amount of transcript was evaluated by 32P incorporation and the number of molecules detectable was estimated by performing RT-PCR on 1 O-fold serial dilutions of the transcript.",
