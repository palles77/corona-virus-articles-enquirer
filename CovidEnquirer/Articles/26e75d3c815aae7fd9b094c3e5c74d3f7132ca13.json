There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission.",

As numbers of women affected by COVID 19 in pregnancy increase, it is likely to become necessary to care for women locally with referral where appropriate for fetal growth restriction, pre-term delivery and women requiring treatment on an Infectious Diseases specialist unit or HCID unit \uf0b7 In common with other maternal infections, decisions about the use of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity should be made in consultation with infectious disease, neonatal and maternal-fetal medicine consultants 2. Delivery \uf0b7 Any guidance must be made in the absence of almost any useful information. Therefore the precautionary principle should guide us, but must balance risks to mother and baby. \uf0b7 Decision on the mode of delivery should be individualised. Caesarean section may be necessitated by maternal hypoxaemia or fetal growth restriction. \uf0b7 We note the very recent consensus guidance from China suggests that \"delayed cord clamping (DCC) is not recommended\" in order to reduce the risk of vertical transmission. We recommend that the baby can be cleaned of maternal blood and secretions quickly and delayed cord clamping can be undertaken.",
