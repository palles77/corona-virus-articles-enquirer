In the United States, 220,000 hospital admissions occur annually because of diarrhea; these account for 10% of all hospitalizations of young children. About 300 deaths occur from diarrhea and its complications each year in the United States; worldwide, an estimated 5 to 18 million children die each year from diarrhea.",

Acute diarrhea is usually a self-limited illness that lasts for 2 weeks or less. Chronic diarrhea is defined as diarrhea that persists for more than 2 or 3 weeks. Diarrhea in adults is usually defined as a stool volume output of more than 200 mL each day. In children, a stool output that exceeds 10 mL/kg/day is considered diarrhea. A more practical definition is that diarrhea is present when stools increase in frequency, fluidity (water content), or volume, in comparison with the previously established \"normal\" pattern. Wide variability exists in normal bowel patterns from child to child; age-related changes occur. Breast-fed infants may pass a loose or seedy stool with each nursing. In older infants or children, stool frequency may vary from several times each day to once every several days. The differential diagnosis of acute and chronic childhood diarrhea is presented in ",

Confirmation may be obtained with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and latex agglutination assays for rotavirus detection in stool.

Salmonella infection is usually spread through contaminated water supplies or food (meat, chicken, eggs, raw milk, and fresh produce). Most infections in the United States are sporadic rather than epidemic. Although an infected food handler may contaminate food sources, the farm animals are often infected.

During a 12-to 72-hour incubation period, patients may develop a nonspecific prodrome characterized by fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting. A colitis affecting predominantly the rectosigmoid region develops and results in abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea. In more severe infections (bacillary dysentery), blood and mucus are passed in small, very frequent stools. High fever in young infants may induce a febrile seizure (see Chapter 39). The association of seizures with shigellosis was attributed to neurotoxic effect of Shigella toxin. The seizures may represent a subgroup of common febrile seizures. Stool culture provides the only definitive means of differentiating this organism from other pathogens. Unlike Salmonella-caused gastroenteritis, antibiotic treatment is indicated in shigellosis because it shortens the duration of diarrhea, prevents further spread of the organism, and decreases the secondary attack rate, inasmuch as humans provide the only reservoir for this organism (see Table 15 -10).",

Two food poisoning syndromes can occur. A shortincubation disease (1 to 6 hours) results from ingestion of preformed toxin and is characterized by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, similar to staphylococcal food poisoning. A long-incubation period disease (8 to 16 hours) is caused by in vivo production of an enterotoxin and is characterized by abdominal pain, tenesmus, and profuse watery diarrhea.

Fever or without blood and often associated with tenesmus, low-grade fever, weight loss, and mild anemia, is a very common manifestation of ulcerative colitis (Table 15 -23). As in Crohn disease, extraintestinal manifestations are also common (see Table 15 -22).",

The findings of aphthous lesions with intervening normal appearing mucosa is highly suggestive of Crohn disease, whereas diffuse inflammation that begins at the anal verge and progresses proximally suggests ulcerative colitis. Mucosal biopsies taken to detect histopathologic abnormalities are still the most sensitive test for differentiating among Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitides.

The approach to therapy in Crohn disease is rapidly changing with the addition of more potent, mucosal healing properties of immunomodulator drugs and biologic agents (Table 15-28) . Steroids are not considered the mainstay of therapy in IBD, but they are used in patients with active severe disease. The relapse rate after discontinuation of steroids may be as high as 70% within 1 year. Sulfasalazine and its analogues (mesalamine) are used in mild to moderate Crohn colitis and ulcerative colitis. These agents have been shown to facilitate discontinuation of steroids and may reduce the relapse rate afterward. Despite the efficacy of salicylate preparations, many children cannot be maintained in remission without the use of steroids. Because long-term use of steroids can lead to numerous steroid-related complications, immunomodulatory agents are first-line treatment in moderate to severe Crohn disease. The two most commonly used agents are azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine. Both appear to maintain remission while allowing reduction in steroid dosage. In addition, 6-mercaptopurine is effective in the healing of perineal fistulas. The use of cyclosporine and tacrolimus in the treatment of severe refractory disease has been disappointing. Antibiotics, particularly metronidazole, are effective in healing certain perineal lesions in Crohn disease but are not beneficial in the general management of Crohn colitis and ileocolitis.",

Undernutrition is multifactorial, including poor intake caused by anorexia, meal-related cramping, and diarrhea, as well as malabsorption from small-bowel involvement and increased metabolic demands from the chronic inflammatory process.
