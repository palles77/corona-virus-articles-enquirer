            "text": "(TGN). It has recently been reported that the organization of the Golgi complex is disrupted in cells treated with the fungal metabolite, brefeldin-A. Under these conditions, it was shown that resident enzymes of the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi return to the ER. We report here that 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors, when pulse-labeled within the ER of brefeldin-Atreated cells, acquired numerous N-linked galactose residues with a half time of approximately 2 h, as measured by their ability to bind to RCA-I lectin affinity columns. In contrast, Limax flavus lectin chromatography revealed that <10% of these receptors acquired sialic acid after 8 h in brefeldin-A. Two lines of evidence suggested that proteins within and beyond the TGN did not return to the ER in the presence of brefeldin-A. First, the majority of 300-kD mannose 6-phosphate receptors present in the TGN and endosomes did not return to the ER after up to 6 h in brefeldin-A, as determined by their failure to contact galactosyltransferase that had relocated there. Moreover, although marmose 6-phosphate receptors did not acquire sialic acid when present in the ER of brefeldin-A-treated cells, they were readily sialylated when labeled at the cell surface and transported to the TGN. These experiments indicate that galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme, returns to the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of brefeldin-A, while the bulk of sialyltransferase, a resident of the TGN, does not. Our findings support the proposal that the TGN is a distinct, fourth compartment of the Golgi apparatus that is insensitive to brefeldin-A.",

            "text": "IOCHEMICAL fractionation experiments and the immunocytochemical localization of specific glycosyltransferases and their products have led to the notion that the Golgi complex is divided into at least three distinct subcomparmaents (11, 21, 23, 27) . The first compartment, termed the cis-Golgi, is thought to house N-acetylglucosamine (Glc-NAc)t-l-phosphodiester ot-N-acetylglucosaminidase (18) , an enzyme involved in the construction of mannose 6-phosphate (man6P) residues on lysosomal enzyme oligosaccharide side chains. The medial Golgi houses GlcNAc transferase I (12) , and galactosyltransferase is located predominantly in trans-Golgi cisternae (37) . Since proteins pass through the Golgi by a series of vesicular transfers (39) from the cisto the medial to the trans-Golgi (3, 42) , the assembly of N-linked oligosaccharide chains is regulated by the order in which proteins gain access to particular mannosidases and glycosyltransferases (27) . Beyond oligosaccharide assembly, the significance of Golgi compartmentation is not fully understood. phate receptors, when pulse-labeled in the ER of BFAtreated cells, readily acquired N-linked galactose, yet only rarely acquired sialic acid residues. We show here that the failure of proteins to acquire sialic acid is most likely due to a failure of sialyltransferase to relocate to the ER, rather than an inability of the enzyme to act within the ER. Our results indicate that unlike the cis-, medial, and trans-Golgi cisternae, the TGN is insensitive to BFA action.",

This receptor provides a sensitive means to detect glycosyltransferase action, since it contains 19 potential N-linked oligosaccharide addition sites (30) and is highly glycosylated. The experiment was carried out as follows. CHO cells were labeled with [35S]methionlne and cysteine for 60 rain to label newly synthesized rnan6P receptors. At this time, labeled man6P receptors reside in the ER, since these receptors require up to 3 h to fold and be completely exported from this compartment (19, 40) . Cells were then chased for various times in the presence of BFA, and the potential acquisition of galactose residues was determined by affinity chromatography of isolated man6P receptors on columns of the galactosespecific lectin, RCA-I (1). To further increase the sensitivity of the assay, we used CHO clone 1021 cells that lack apparent sialyltransferase activity (6, 8) . In these cells, any added galactose residues will be present at the termini of N-linked oligosaccharides and fully accessible for optimal lectin binding (1). Fig . I (top) shows the results obtained from such an experiment. Man6P receptors isolated from cells immediately after the labeling period should not have contained galacrose. As expected, none of the man6P receptors bound to RCA-I agarose; all were recovered in the flowthrough fraction. In contrast, with increasing times of BFA treatment, man6P receptors acquired the ability to be retained on an RCA-I column, and could be eluted from such columns with galactose. Quantitative analysis of this experiment (Fig. I, bottom) showed that half of the man6P receptors gained the Triangles, +BFA; squares, -BFA. capacity to bind RCA-I agarose within '~2 h. This was somewhat slower than the rate observed in the absence of BFA (hr~ = 80 rain). A control experiment showed that galactose addition was not due to the action of newly synthesized galactosyltransferase, also accumulated in the ER, since cyclobeximide had essentially no effect on the extent of galactose addition (not shown).",

To test this, we used an experimental scheme devised by Duncan and Kornfeld (10) to measure the transport of man6P receptors from the cell surface back to the TGN. The approach uses CHO clone 13 cells, in which glycoproteins lack galactose residues and thus can be labeled at the plasma membrane using galactosyltransferase and UDP-[3H]galactose.

Although the extent of sialylation was reproducibly lower ('o65 %) in the presence of BFA than in its absence, significant addition of sialic acid was detected under both conditions.

After a chase period of up to 6 h, there was only a very slight increase ('o5 %) in the fraction of man6P receptors that bound to an RCA-I column. These results confirm that the majority of CHO cell man6P receptors do not appear to return to the site of Golgi o~-mannosidase I (cis/medial Golgi) after transport to the TGN (10) .   Fig, 5 (top) shows the results obtained if man6P receptors were pulse-labeled either in the ER (squares) or chased to compartments beyond the TGN (triangles) in the presence of dMM, and then further chased for various times without DMM, but in the presence of BFA. If the receptors were present in the ER, they were efficiently modified by galactosyltransferase. The rate of galactose addition was slightly slower than that observed in the absence of dMM pretreatmerit ( Fig. 1) , probably due to the time required to reverse the effect of dMM (4, 10, 33) . On the other hand, if the receptors were permitted to pass through the TGN prior to the addition of BFA, only a very small increase was detected in the amount of man6P receptors containing galactose, even after 6 h of incubation (Fig. 5, triangles) . The small increase observed ('~8%) was very close to that observed in the absence of BFA (Fig. 5, bottom) . Duncan and Kornfeld have shown that only '~10% of man6P receptors labeled at the surface of CHO cells can be detected to acquire sialic acid upon their return to the TGN after 6 h of reculture (10) . In our hands, only ,x,4-6% of the surface-labeled receptor acquired sialic acid after 6 hours (Fig. 4) . If this value represents the total amount of man6P receptor transitting through the TGN in 6 h, it would be difficult to detect the potential return of such a small quantity of man6P receptors from the TGN to the ER, especially with the ,'~2-h lag for galactose addition in that compartment (Fig.  5) . However, results identical to those shown in Fig. 5 were obtained using BW5147 ceils, in which 40% of surfacelabeled man6P receptors return to the TGN in 3 h (10). This strongly supports the conclusion that the majority of man6P receptors within and beyond the TGN do not return to the ER in BFA.",

These data confirm the findings of Lippincott-Schwartz et al. (29) who have used immunofluoresccnce to show that the trans-Golgi enzyme, galactosyltransferase, returns to the ER in the presence of BFA. In addition, our experiments suggest that sialyltransferase has a different fate in BFA than galactosyltransferase, since the half time for sialic acid addition to proteins within the ER (,~60 h) was 30 times greater than that measured for galactose addition. The simplest explanation for these findings would be that sialyltransferase, a component of the TGN, is not redistributed to the ER in BFA, while the trans-Golgi enzyme, galactosyltransferase, is. If true, this supports the proposal that the trans-Golgi and TGN are distinct compartments (21) .",

Man6P receptors were transported to a compartment housing active sialyltransferase, whether or not the culture media contained BFA. Moreover, this compartment was not the ER, since man6P receptors pulse-labeled within the ER did not receive sialic acid. Unfortunately, our attempts to localize sialyltransferase by indirect immunofluorescence under these conditions were unsuccessful, probably due to the particularly low abundance of this enzyme in cultured cells. Nevertheless, although not shown directly, it is most likely that the sialyltransferase-containing compartment represents the TGN.",

The O-linked oligosaccharides of glycophorin contain sialic acid both in ~-2,3 linkage to galactose, as well as in ot-2,6 linkage to GalNAc (43) . If the GalNAc-specific sialyltransferase is located in the trans-Golgi along with galactosyltransferase, whereas the Gal-specific sialyltransferase is located primarily in the \"I'GN, only the GalNAcspecific enzyme would redistribute to the ER in BFA.

This model could easily explain why most Golgi enzymes are redistributed to the ER, if one assumes that each cisterna of the Golgi complex communicates with its proximal neighbor by shuttling transport vesicles. This model does not explain why TGN components do not return to the ER, because putative shuttling vesicles might be expected to move between the TGN and trans-Golgi as frequently as they traverse between transand medial Golgi cisternae.

The TGN is the site to which man6P receptors recycle (10, 17, 26, 35) , and where viral glycoproteins accumulate at 20\u00b0C (24, 41). The TGN is also a much more extended and tubular structure than the other Golgi cisternae, and thus, it is distinguished by its unique morphological characteristics. Despite numerous distinctions between the TGN and other Golgi cisternae, it is likely that the TGN is nevertheless, an integral part of the Golgi complex. Grifliths et al. (25) have shown that the TGN and more proximal Golgi cisternae are highly interrelated structures. At 20\u00b0C, the TGN increases in size, concomitant with a decrease in size of preceding Golgi compartments (25) . In addition, these workers have calculated that 12% of the TGN surface area is comprised of flattened cisternae which are morphologically indistinguishable from, and located immediately adjacent to, the other cisternae of the Golgi stack. Thus, although the TGN is functionally distinct from other Golgi cisternae (21), it is appropriate to consider it as a specialized subcompartment of the Golgi complex. An important future challenge will be to elucidate the mechanism by which the TGN gains (and maintains) its identity.",
