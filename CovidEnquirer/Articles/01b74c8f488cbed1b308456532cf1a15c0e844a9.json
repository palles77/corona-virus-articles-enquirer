However, whether PRRSV could induce the production of IFN-\u2424 is controversial. In this paper, we first time found that PRRSV could phosphorylate IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and weakly activate the IFN-\u2424 promoter in MARC-145 cells in early infection, but the activations of IRF-3 and IFN-\u2424 promoter were rapidly inhibited in the following infection. Furthermore, which components or products of the invading PRRSV cause PRRSV to inhibit IFN-\u2424 promoter activity attracted our attentions. The obtained results showed that PRRSV nsp1 could inhibit Poly(I:C)-induced IFN-\u2424 promoter activity in MARC-145 cells by down-regulating the protein level of IRF-3 and inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF-3. In conclusion, our results suggested that PRRSV could be sensed by professional IFN-\u2424-producing system and had mechanisms to inhibit this action in MARC-145 cells.",

Infection with PRRSV also predisposes pigs to secondary infection by bacterial and viral pathogens, which may be due to the immunosuppression induced by the virus (Feng et al., 2001; Mateu and Diaz, 2008) .",

            "text": "IFN-\u2424 is the first responder against animal virus infection (Muller et al., 1994; Weber et al., 2004) . When virus infects, the virus could be recognized by the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as membrane bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). These PAMPs recruit different adaptor proteins, for example, TLRs recruits the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88(MyD88) and Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN(TRIF) while RIG-I recruits virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA), to make TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) or IB kinase-(IKK-) phosphorylate IRF-3 and finally to induce IFN-\u2424 transcription (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008) . Then, IFN-\u2424 induces the IFN-regulated genes responsible for the antiviral response (Sadler and Williams, 2008) . However, during the co-evolution with the host cells, many viruses have developed defensive mechanisms to inhibit IFN-\u2424 production, making it difficult for host cells to defeat viral infection (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008; Weber et al., 2004) . Luo et al. (2008) and Miller et al. (2004) concluded that PRRSV does not induce IFN-\u2424 in MARC-145 cells infected with PRRSV, but Luo et al. did not detect the level of IFN-\u2424 mRNA by RT-PCR, and in Miller's paper, the level of IFN-\u2424 appears a little higher in MARC-145 cells infected by PRRSV than that in control group, which may lead to a suspicion that whether PRRSV could induce IFN-\u2424 production or not may be valued for verifying. Furthermore, Genini et al. (2008) and Loving et al. (2007) reported that PRRSV could induce the production of IFN-\u2424 in primary swine cells, which supply a clue that maybe PRRSV could also induce the production of IFN-\u2424 in MARC-145 cells. Previous studies have documented that SARS-CoV nsp3 could inhibit the IFN-\u2424 production by its papain-like protease domain (Devaraj et al., 2007) and SARS-CoV N was capable of inhibiting IFN-\u2424 production (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) . It is a coincidence that PRRSV nsp1 also contained papain-like protease domain (den Boon et al., 1995) and the crystal structure of PRRSV N protein was similar to that of SARS-CoV N protein (Yu et al., 2006) . So, the purpose of the present experiments is to analyze the patterns of IFN-\u2424 promoter activity in MARC-145 cells during infection with PRRSV and to analyze whether PRRSV nsp1 and N protein could inhibit IFN-\u2424 production.",

(Cafruny et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2002) , which was also confirmed in our experiment (data not shown). Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining, and approximately 93% of PRRSVinfected cells were viable at 48 h p.i. (data not shown). To investigate whether PRRSV could induce the IFN-\u2424 response in cell culture, MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 0.05. At a certain time, cells were co-transfected with p-284 Luc and phRL-TK, and 18 h later, the cells were harvested and subjected to a dual luciferase reporter assay system. As shown in Fig. 1A , PRRSV could activate IFN-\u2424 promoter in MARC-145 Cells at 24 h p.i., but the activity of IFN-\u2424 promoter was much lower than that triggered by Poly(I:C). And the activity of IFN-\u2424 promoter was rapidly inhibited in the following infection. The expression of IFN-\u2424 mRNA was also analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR at the different time points after PRRSV infection and gotten the results similar to that of Fig. 1A (data not shown) . To confirm this result, the level of pIRF-3 was also detected because pIRF-3 was a necessary transcription factor to the activation of IFN-\u2424 promoter (Peters et al., 2002; Yoneyama et al., 1998) . In consistent with the results of Fig. 1A , PRRSV could phosphorylate IRF-3 in early stage of infection (24 h p.i.), but after that, no detectable levels of pIRF-3 showed at certain time interval (Fig. 1B) .",

The results indicated that PRRSV could trigger the activation of IRF-3 as well as induce the activation of IFN-\u2424 promoter at 24 h p.i., but the activities were much lower than that triggered by the Poly(I:C). And their activities were rapidly inhibited in following infection (Fig. 1) . So it is reasonable to speculate that PRRSV could be sensed by professional IFN-\u2424-producing system and had mechanisms to inhibit this action in MARC-145 cells.",

Our present work indicated that PRRSV nsp1 inhibited the IFN-\u2424 production induced by Poly(I:C), while N protein did not (Fig. 2) . It's unexpected that PRRSV N protein could not inhibit the IFN-\u2424 production, because a protein's function generally depended on its three-dimension structure or conformation.

            "text": "Poly(I:C), a double-stranded RNA, could be recognized by TLR3 (Yamamoto et al., 2003) and RIG-I (Kato et al., 2006) . Then through TBK1, TLR3 recruited TRIF and RIG-I recruited VISA to phosphorylate IRF-3 and finally activate IFN-\u2424 promoter (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008) . Over-expression of RIG-I, VISA, TBK1 or TRIF could induce the activation of IRF-3 and promote the activation of IFN-\u2424 promoter (Devaraj et al., 2007; Yoneyama et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2008) . Our data showed that nsp1 antagonized the IFN-\u2424 production induced by RIG-I, VISA, TBK1 or TRIF, which indicated that nsp1 inhibited the IFN-\u2424 production induced by both TLR3 and RIG-I pathways (Fig. 3) . Nevertheless, nsp1 had no effect on the activity of IFN-\u2424 promoter induced by IRF-3(5D), which suggested that nsp1 inhibited IFN-\u2424 production by suppressing the activation of IRF-3. This speculation has been confirmed. PRRSV nsp1 downregulated the protein level of IRF-3 and inhibited Poly(I:C)-induced phosphorylation of IRF-3, but had no effect on the level of IRF-3 mRNA (Fig. 4) . Perhaps, nsp1 inhibited the translation of IRF-3 or induced the degradation of IRF-3 protein or inhibited the activation of kinase to phosphorylate IRF-3. SARS-CoV nsp3 inhibited phosphorylation of IRF-3 through its papain-like protease domain to be interacted with IRF-3 but did not down-regulated the protein level of IRF-3 (Devaraj et al., 2007) , while the Npro protein of Classical Swine Fever Virus, similar to the group of papain-like proteases (Stark et al., 1993) , could antagonize IRF-3 activity by inducing its proteasomal degradation (Bauhofer et al., 2007) . PRRSV nsp1 also contains papain-like protease domain (den Boon et al., 1995) and PRRSV nsp1 down-regulated the protein level of IRF-3. So it is possible that PRRSV nsp1 inhibits the IRF-3 activation by inducing IRF-3 degradation or inhibits the activation of kinase to phosphorylate IRF-3. And this suppositional mechanism deserves a further study.",

            "text": "It is known that type I IFN system (IFN-\u2423/\u2424) provides an important first-host response to viral intruders (Weber et al., 2004) , and type I IFN is essential to the initial control of virus infection and the establishment of an adaptive immune response (Muller et al., 1994) . Many viruses developed defensive mechanisms to inhibit IFN-\u2424 production (Bowie and Unterholzner, 2008; Devaraj et al., 2007; Weber et al., 2004) . The influenza virus NS1 protein, a multifunctional facilitator of virus replication, could antagonize the IFN-\u2424 production (Hale et al., 2008) . Deletion of the IFN-\u2424 antagonist NS1 could produce a novel type of influenza vaccine (Wacheck et al., 2010) . Novel antagonists against influenza virus NS1, only significantly and specifically inhibiting influenza A replication in cell capable of interferon production, could be a potential drug for influenza virus-treatment (Basu et al., 2009) . Previous studies also showed intriguing observations that recombinant IFN-\u2424 not only protected swine alveolar macrophages and MARC-145 cells from infection with PRRSV (Overend et al., 2007) , but also could reduce the yield of PRRSV in vivo (Buddaert et al., 1998) . Perhaps, inhibition of IFN-\u2424 production leads to the persistent infection of PRRSV. Our data demonstrated that PRRSV could inhibit the IFN-\u2424 production by PRRSV nsp1. In the future, it will be interesting to research on the function or characterization of PRRSV nsp1 in virus-induced immunosuppression and virus replication, and PRRSV nsp1 may be used as a potent target for exploiting new drags for PRRSV treatment or PRRSV vaccine.",
