Moreover, it focused on the longterm outcomes of respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus infections in prematurely born infants and emphasised the necessity for the development of relevant preventative strategies. Other topics that were covered included the vaccination policy in relation to the migration crisis, mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B and c viruses, vaccination against human papilloma viruses in boys and advances on intranasal live-attenuated vaccination against influenza. Emphasis was also given to the role of probiotics in the management of viral infections in childhood, the potential association between viral infections and the pathogenesis of asthma, fetal and neonatal brain imaging and the paediatric intensive care of children with central nervous system viral infections. Moreover, an interesting overview of the viral causes of perinatal mortality in ancient Greece was given, where recent archaeological findings from the Athenian Agora's bone well were presented. Finally, different continuing medical educational options in Paediatric Virology were analysed and evaluated. The present review provides an update of the key topics discussed during the workshop.",

Several of these infections are viral, e.g., herpes-group viruses, polyomaviruses and Torque teno viruses, and these result in long-time persistence and latency within human specific cell types (6) . The fate of the latent genomes seems to vary substantially. They may remain dormant for the whole lifetime without any recognisable side effect. During prolonged latency, their genomes may become defective and can eventually be degraded. In particular, herpes-group viruses may become re-activated, leading locally to viral production and cell lysis. The interaction of the latent genomes with mutagenic chemical, physical or other biological factors may dysregulate the control of latency or persistence and may thus result in local exacerbations, mainly as the result of immunoreactivity (6) .",

It has also been shown that it reduces the risk of developing certain malignant tumours arising in early childhood, e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or in young adolescence, e.g., Hodgkin's disease (HD). Apparently, specific sugars in human milk modify the receptors blocking the uptake of noroviruses and rotaviruses during the breast feeding phase. The maturation of the immune system during this period, subsequently, facilitates an effective immune response during the weaning period. The uptake of specific sialic acids, not produced in humans, but present in cow milk and meat products, beginning during the weaning time, results in their incorporation into the cell surface glycoproteins and gangliosides. The resulting modification of cell surface receptors alters their susceptibility to specific viral infections, e.g., human polyomavirus type 9 and others. Current analyses suggest that these receptors now permit the binding of infectious agents present in dairy cattle serum and milk products, leading to their longtime persistence and latency and their potential pathogenicity under conditions of reactivation. Thus, the protective effects of breast feeding, which allows for the maturation of the immune response during the first years of life, emerges as critical period, which determines the uptake and latency of specific infections (7).",

Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by RSV increase this morbidity. Although prematurely born infants are functionally (9,10) and genetically (11) predisposed to RSV LRTIs, their lung function in infancy is worse after the LRTI (12, 13) . RSV LRTIs have more long-term effects, as evidenced by very prematurely born infants, who have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPd) and then subsequently suffer from an RSV LRTI hospitalisation; in the first 2 years after birth these infants need increased healthcare utilisation and have poorer pulmonary functions at school age (14) . There are limited data to suggest that rhinovirus (RV) may adversely affect on respiratory-related outcomes in prematurely born infants. In a previous study, in 8 prematurely born infants with BPd, the development of RV LRTIs was associated with a sustained worsening of their clinical status, requiring the addition of novel therapies for prolonged periods of time (15) . Furthermore, in another study, prematurely born infants, who had developed RV LRTI, during infancy, had higher healthcare utilisation costs, including greater numbers of hospital, outpatient and respiratory-related general practitioner (GP) attendances, than infants without a viral LRTI (16) .",

The RV group had a poorer lung function than those who had not suffered an LRTI during infancy. Cluster analysis of the data demonstrated that infants with an extremely low birthweight requiring prolonged ventilation were at an increased risk of suffering from an RV LRTI in infancy and had higher healthcare utilisation and impaired lung function at school age (18) . These data suggest that both RSV and RV LRTI increase chronic respiratory morbidity in prematurely born infants and, as a consequence, this should be taken into consideration regarding the development of relevant preventative strategies.",

In fact, it is important that a great number of immunised refugee children are regularly attending lessons in Greek schools. Public Health Authorities and NGOs have indeed worked hard together, in order to protect children, living through one of the biggest crisis of our times, from infectious diseases. The challenge, today, is to continue the immunisation of refugees and migrants in Greece, as part of routine primary healthcare and to develop a plan for providing immunisation to all newly-arrived refugees and migrants. For this reason, an effective strategy should be to tailor immunisation services on the specific needs of the target populations (27) .",

HPVs infect epithelial tissue and their life cycle is closely intertwined with the differentiation of the epithelium (41, 42) . HPV requires the host DNA replication machinery in order to replicate its genome. This maintains the keratinocytes in a proliferative state via the action of specific HPV proteins, of which the best characterised are E6 and E7 and thus, creates an environment amenable to carcinogenesis (43) . Breast feeding 'Prolonged breast feeding is clearly of great benefit for babies. Human milk contains some species-specific sugars, which block the uptake of potentially dangerous viruses (e.g., noro-and rotaviruses), which are the cause for high infant mortality for newborn children, specifically in developing parts of this world. During a period of ~6 months of breast feeding the immune system matures and subsequently such infections have a less deleterious impact. The uptake, however, of 5-N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (not produced in humans) by bovine milk and meat leads to the incorporation of this sialic acid into cellular glycoproteins and modifies those receptors, rendering them susceptible for other virus infections (e.g., human polyomavirus type 9 and others).'",

Studies on HPV seropositivity in young children indicate a relatively low prevalence of HPV antibodies (approximately 0-10%) (48) . The seroprevalence significantly increases in adolescence with the commencement of sexual activity. Mucosal HPV infection is often described as a sexually transmitted infection; however, the presence of such infections in infants and young children suggests that the virus may also be vertically and horizontally transmitted. There is strong evidence that maternal HPV cervical infection at the time of delivery can be transmitted to the newborn and there is a strong association between development of juvenile RRP and the presence of maternal genital warts during pregnancy (49) . The detection of HPV DNA in spermatozoa and seminal plasma, as well as in amniotic fluid and placental tissue, suggests that peri-conceptual and prenatal transmission may also be possible (46, 47) . HPV can be transmitted horizontally (i.e., by kissing or touch) or to different sites by auto-inoculation (46, 47) . In the case of anogenital warts in particular, sexual abuse remains an important consideration. There are a lack of data on the persistence of HPV infections in children and their relation to the subsequent development of HPV-associated diseases, such as oropharyngeal carcinoma.",

The Nobelist laureate Professor Harald zur Hausen has actively advocated the vaccination of boys for the eradication of HPV infection and has emphasised that male HPV vaccination should be included into the current vaccination programmes. His publication with Professor Karin Michels from Harvard Medical School entitled 'HPV vaccine for all' and published in 2009 in Lancet has been one of the very first publications advocating the vaccination of boys (50) . To date, the United States, canada, Australia, and Austria have currently implemented routine vaccination of girls as well as boys (51) (52) (53) . The recent WHO guidelines recommended the vaccination of girls aged 9-14 years as the primary target population, and the vaccination of additional target populations (females 15 years and older, and males) only if feasible, affordable and cost-effective (54) . Gender-neutral vaccination may achieve greater herd protection effects and direct protection of males; however gender-neutral programmes have only been implemented recently and their impact on HPV-related diseases at a population level remains to be determined (54) . Nevertheless, there are strong data that quadrivalent HPV vaccination is effective in reducing anal intraepithelial neoplasia (50% reduction in the intention-to-treat population and 78% in the per-protocol population) (55) . Similar prospective data for penile cancers and oropharyngeal cancers is lacking; however, there are data suggesting that HPV infections at these sites are reduced following vaccination (56, 57) .",

They are non-pathogenic in the normal host, resist processing and are able to survive in the human digestive tract. Prebiotics (e.g., Fructo-and Galacto-oligosaccharides) are non-viable food components, which can confer a significant health benefit on the host by modulating intestinal microflora. Synbiotics are a combination of pro-and prebiotics. The gut microflora is a complex ecosystem supporting the structure and function of the intestinal mucosa. Probiotics have the ability to modify the gut microflora either by lowering colonic pH through production of short-chain fatty acids (ScFAs), or by producing antimicrobial compounds and antitoxins, and or by competing with other bacteria for nutrients. They also enhance gut barrier function and play a role in immunomodulation (72, 73) .",

Fetuses and neonates are susceptible to a wide variety of viral infections most commonly involving the central nervous system (cNS) in greater frequency than adults (81) . Infections of the CNS are a very common worldwide health problem in childhood with significant morbidity and mortality. In children, viruses are the most common cause of cNS infections, followed by bacteria, and less frequently by fungi and other causes. Advances in the prenatal and perinatal care together with technological advent of imaging modalities have enabled timely detection and detailed exploration of symptoms and signs in the neonatal population starting from the fetal life. Although imaging is practically unable to set the diagnosis of viral infection in the fetuses and neonates, moreover to reveal the pathogens, it has, however, the potential to accurately suggest this scenario, map the extent of involvement and direct the investigation and the consultation accordingly.

The CNS is protected by effective immune responses and multi-layer barriers; however, some viruses enter the CNS with efficiency via the bloodstream or by directly infecting nerves that innervate peripheral tissues, resulting in immune-mediated pathology (89) . Viral infections of the cNS more often cause meningitis, characterised by a high fever, headaches, vomiting, photophobia and neck stiffness and encephalitis, which appear with clinical evidence of neurological dysfunction, such as altered mental status, seizures, behavioral changes and focal neurologic signs (90) . Other clinical manifestations are myelitis, characterised by weakness, bladder dysfunction, flaccid paralysis and reduced or absent reflexes, radiculitis, which is characterised by weakness, shooting pain, dysesthesia and diminished reflexes and complex syndromes, such as meningoencephalitis and encephalomyelitis. Viruses affect different sites of the CNS; enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and mumps virus (MuV) are responsible for >90% of cases of aseptic meningitis, whereas herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is the most common cause of encephalitis in developed countries. Other types of herpes viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cMV, varicellazoster virus (VZV) and human herpes viruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and -7) can invade the brain and influence the neurological status of children. Additionally, there are viruses (Table III) , such as West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus and Western and Eastern equine encephalitis virus, with certain geographic distribution and their differential diagnosis should be taken into account in cases of children, who have travelled in susceptible areas (91, 92) . According to the recent data from the Paediatric Intensive care Unit (PICU) of the 'Aglaia Kyriakou' Children's Hospital (88) in Athens, Greece, among 29 children with cNS infection admitted to the PIcU during the past 5 years, 17 patients (59%) had a viral infection; however, a certain aetiological factor was detected in only 6 of these patients (4 cases with influenza, 1 case with enterovirus and 1 case with HHV-7), whereas 2 patients suffered from autoimmune encephalitis.",

Enterovirus infection requires only supportive care and in more severe cases intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) alone or in combination with high doses of corticosteroids (90) . Other drugs, such as oseltamivir or ganciclovir, are administered according to the underlying viral cause. Viral CNS infections are a life-threatening emergency. Supportive care is crucial and includes airway management, cardiorespiratory support, the maintenance of fluids and electrolyte balance and the management of seizures, according to specific guidelines (94) . Approximately 30% of patients require PICU admission. The overall mortality rates range from 0 to 7%, depending on the pathogen, age and clinical and laboratory findings at the time of presentation. Approximately 35% of survivors will suffer from some form of permanent disability (seizures, learning problems, motor deficits, developmental delay) with much a higher incidence, two thirds of patients, in HSV encephalitis cases.",

It remains to be clarified though, whether it is the specific viral respiratory infection that plays the causative role in asthmatogenesis or whether viral-induced wheezing is just a marker of predisposed individuals for the subsequent development of asthma (104) . It has been well demonstrated that there is an interaction of host factors with viral respiratory infections that promote recurrent virus-induced wheezing and the subsequent development of asthma (101) . The synergistic interaction between allergies and viruses can be explained via various mechanisms, such as interferon deficiency, Th2-biased immunity, defective anti-inflammatory response, airway hyper responsiveness and reduced barrier function (97, 103) . In a recent randomised trial of 429 high-risk infants, treatment with palivizumab of otherwise healthy preterm infants in order to avoid a serious RSV infection was associated with decreased recurrent wheezing rate when compared with the placebo group (105) . RSV causes cyto- pathic damage to the airway epithelium and by that can affect the function of the epithelium and airway smooth muscle (100) .",

As estimated from long bone lengths, the age of the infants ranged from 26 weeks in utero to 6 months post-term, with a peak at 38-40 weeks (110) . The cause of death for the infants in the Agora's well has been the topic of much speculation over the past 70 years. Suggestions have included war-related famine or epidemic disease, human sacrifice and large-scale infanticide. One of the goals of this project was to evaluate the evidence for pathologies in the infants in order to evaluate the causes of death. Infant death rates from natural causes in the ancient world were very high, and up to 50% of neonates may have died early in the postnatal period (111) . In addition, approximately 15% of these skeletons are from infants born pre-term, as young as 26 weeks in utero.

It is a professional responsibility for all practicing paediatricians to maintain, develop and increase their knowledge, clinical skills and professional performance with an aim to enhance their clinical effectiveness and competence (118) (119) (120) (121) (122) . Paediatric Virology is indeed a new educational challenge with rapidly increasing and changing educational needs and preferences (123) . This is fostered by several developments in the fields of Clinical Virology and Molecular Medicine, emerging viral diseases as well as technical innovations, which have expanded our diagnostic and therapeutic approaches towards neonatal and paediatric viral infections.",

Self-directed learning activity should be encouraged; however, CME in Paediatric Virology should also instill collegiality, interaction and collaboration between disciplines. Without a doubt, Paediatric Virologists should have a leading role in cME in Paediatric Virology focusing on academic excellence and state-of-the-art medical education of practicing paediatricians. Further discussion is required on how different educational activities, such as on-line learning, interactive case-based workshops and creation of educational e-platforms, can increase their potential worth for the promotion of Peadiatrics and Public Health. cytology at the University of Florida, USA and academic student of Dr George N.

However, in 2015/16, in the UK, Finland and canada, LAIV VE was shown to be protective against the drifted influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses and with suboptimal effectiveness only against A(H1N1)pdm09 compared to IIV (63-65).
