JOHNSTON Because microorganisms are widely distributed in animals and in foods of animal origin, control of foodbome infection is a formidable undertaking. The presence of many zoonotic diseases is often unsuspected or unrecognised in animals. On farms in the UK, especially the more intensively operated units, herd health schemes are run in cooperation with the veterinary practitioner and the State Veterinary Service where monitoring of disease is routinely carried out and active preventive medicine practised. Similar schemes are run in other developed countries. Factors which perpetuate problems include methods of husbandry (including the type of feedstuffs used), transport of live animals, and slaughter and meat processing practices (fig 1) . Whichever system of farming is considered, it must be accepted that, however healthy our animals seem to be, pathogenic organisms are taken up from the environment, carried in the intestinal tract, and excreted in the faeces ( fig 2) . The aim, however, is to produce healthy animals, within the limits of humane rearing systems, with reasonable return on investment.",

            "text": "Salmonella infection in animals produces an enteritis which affects the small and large intestines; many serovars, generally host-specific, have been identified. Salmonella dublin and S typhimurium are the most common serovars in ruminants. S dublin has a pronounced tendency to persist in cattle, which become intermittent or constant excretors or latent carriers; infection persists in the lymph nodes or tonsils, which can break down so that the animals become excretors under stress. S dublin is a more common cause of abortion in sheep than S abortus ovis. Disease due to S typhimurium is sporadic and likely to subside after initial exposure, only recurring if the source of infection reappears. This does not, of course, mean that the disease cannot persist in a flock or herd for long periods. In sheep and cattle at grass, clinical salmonellosis can appear when the animals are concentrated in small areas such as lambing pens, holding pens on the farm, or in auction markets, especially when associated with transport. The situation in goats is similar to that in other ruminant species. S cholerae suis infection in pigs has been especially well investigated following large outbreaks in UK pig units in the mid-1960s with high morbidity and mortality rates. Much of this infection was due to swill or garbage feeding which is no longer common practice. S typhimurium has also been found in pig units in which it presents as a necrotic enterocolitis, but in abattoir surveys, other serovars have been found in the mesenteric lymph nodes and caecal contents.! In poultry, salmonellae other than S pullorum, S gallinarum, S enteritidis, and S typhimurium, rarely cause clinical disease; the birds are symptom-free carriers. Clinical disease is seen in the young bird with substantial faecal excretion of organisms in recovered birds at time of slaughter as broilers-about seven weeks old.",

Cjejuni causes abortion in sheep. Commonly, when campylobacters have been isolated from animals with diarrhoea, other pathogens (eg, Cryptosporidium, viruses, and other enteropathogenic bacteria) have been found.",

Septicaemic listeriosis, with or without meningitis, is most common in monogastric animals and young ruminants, whereas the meningeal cephalic form of the disease is more common in adult ruminants. In cattle, listeriosis tends to occur as single cases and sporadic abortions. Outbreaks in sheep and goats have been recorded soon after the start of silage feeding, with organisms subsequently being found in the faeces and milk. All animal species are affected by Escherichia coli, the small intestine being the primary site of infection. The most important E coli are the enterotoxigenic K99 strains which typically cause a distinct acute illness, known as watery scour, in young calves and piglets. Although enteropathogenic and enteroinvasive E coli are also found in animals, the enterohaemorrhagic E coli (EHEC) are of particular zoonotic importance. EHEC 0157:H7 (which is verocytotoxigenic) is increasingly recognised in human disease and may be foodbome, but other verocytotoxigenic E coli serotypes are more important in animals.5 They produce diarrhoea in cattle and pigs (gut oedema disease). EHEC 0157:H7 can certainly be found in the faeces of healthy cattle.",

Movement of animals within and between countries brings additional problems of spread of disease.

Therefore, it is in the industry's interest as well as in the interest of public health to produce healthy animals.

There is a great deal to be said for the opinion that stem and prompt action on the part of the Government five or six months ago might have extinguished the cattle plague. It was then so limited that it would have been possible to isolate it and all persons that had had any connexion with it. And if it be infectious, as nearly everybody who is entitled to have an opinion on the subject thinks it is, this would have prevented its extension, and made it purely local instead of a huge national calamity. But the doctrine of contagion is somehow or other unpopular.... Moreover, this doctrine of contagion is inconvenient. Locomotion is the order of the age, and undoubtedly it is uncommonly inconvenient to say or do anything that interferes in the slightest degree with the liberty of man or beast to go anywhere.... Why should [the Government] not appoint a commission to watch the other plague which we are all secretly dreading? Why should it remain in vague uncertainty (as bad as ignorance) of the most valuable information that must be procurable, if it was only somebody's business to procure it&mdash;of the use or uselessness of quarantine measures in the various places which have been visited with cholera or saved from the visitationand of the efficiency or non-efficiency of the various remedies that have been administered? And why should not this be done at once? Surely the expense of such a course will not be seriously thought of when the possible advantages of it are considered. The Government cannot be complimented on the timeliness of its action in the matter of the cattle plague. Will it not atone for its fault by trying to avert a far greater evil, or at least taking steps that will put us in the best possible position for meeting it? Or will it repeat the folly of waiting till the mischief is done, and the judgment of the country is impaired by panic? No excuse can be valid for not imposing upon the best men that can be got the duty of ascertaining all that can be ascertained from the latest experience.( Oct 14,1865) ",
