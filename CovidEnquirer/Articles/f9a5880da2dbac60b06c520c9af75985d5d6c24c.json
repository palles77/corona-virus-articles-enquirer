We show that the peculiar non-planar shapes of its beating flagellum, dubbed \"spinning lasso\", arise from the mechanical interactions between two of its inner components, namely, the axoneme and the paraflagellar rod. The spontaneous shape of the axoneme and the resting shape of the paraflagellar rod are incompatible. The complex non-planar configurations of the coupled system emerge as the energetically optimal compromise between the two antagonistic components. The model is able to reproduce the experimentally observed flagellar beats and their characteristic spinning lasso geometric signature, namely, travelling waves of torsion with alternating sing along the length of the flagellum.",

The inner structure of the eukaryotic flagellum is an arrangement of microtubules (MTs) and accessory proteins called the axoneme (Ax). A highly conserved structure in evolution, the Ax typically consists of nine cylindrically arranged MT doublets cross-bridged by motor proteins of the dynein family. An internal central pair of MTs is connected by radial spokes to the nine peripheral doublets, determining the typical \"9+2\" axonemal structure. Motor proteins hydrolyze ATP to generate forces that induce doublet sliding. Due to mechanical constraints exerted by linking proteins (nexins) and the basal body, dynein-induced sliding of MTs translates into bending movements of the whole structure. Motor proteins are thought to self regulate their activity via mechanical feedback, generating the periodic beats of flagella, see e.g. [6] and [19] .",

While bending-through-sliding is the accepted fundamental mechanism of flagellar motility, how specific flagellar shapes are determined is not yet clear. For the most studied swimming microorganisms, such as animal sperm cells and the biflagellate alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the flagellar beat is, to a good approximation, planar. For these organisms, beat planarity is thought to be induced by the inter-doublet links between one pair of MTs, typically those numbered 5 and 6 [18] . These links inhibit the relative sliding of the 5-6 MTs pair, thus selecting a beating plane that passes through the center of the Ax and the midpoint between the inhibited MTs. Figure 1 . a) A specimen of freely swimming Euglena gracilis, and b) a sketch of the cross section of its flagellum seen from the distal end. The flagellar inner structure is composed by the paraflagellar rod (PFR, textured), and the axoneme (Ax). The PFR is connected via bonding links to the axonemal doublets 1, 2, and 9 (our numbering convention). The inner structure of the flagellum is enclosed by the flagellar membrane (dotted line). By inhibiting MTs' sliding the PFR selects the spontaneous bending plane of the Ax (dashed line). The solid line that joins the Ax center r a and the PFR center r p cross at an angle \u03c6 p the spontaneous bending plane.",

An apparent exception to beat planarity in kinetoplastids is found in the pathogenic parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which shows a characteristic non-planar \"drill-like\" motion [17] . However, Trypanosoma's flagellum is not free, like that of Leishmania and Crithidia, but it is attached to the organism for most of its length, wrapped helically around the cell body. According to [2] the flagellum-body mechanical interaction could alone explain Trypanosomes' distinctive motion. Confirming this conclusion, [34] showed that Trypanosoma mutants with body-detached flagellum generate fairly planar beating. It is conjectured that the PFR-Ax bonds operate as the 5-6 interdoublet links in Chlamydomonas and sperm cells, inhibiting MTs sliding and selecting a plane of beat [36] .",

We follow closely [14] and [27] in our modeling of the Ax, while we use a simple elastic spring model for the PFR. We show that, under generic actuation, the two flagellar components cannot be simultaneously in their respective states of minimal energy, and this crucially depends on the offset between the spontaneous beating plane of the Ax (dashed line in Figure 1 ) and the line joining the PFR-Ax centers (solid line in Figure 1 ). Instead, the typical outcome is an elastically frustrated configuration of the system, in which the two competing components drive each other out of plane. Under dyneins activation patterns that, in absence of extra-axonemal structures, would produce an asymmetric beat similar to those of Chlamydomonas [23] , or Volvox [26] , the model specifically predicts the torsional signature of the spinning lasso, which we discuss in the following Section.",

In turn, cell body rotations have a role in phototaxis (see Discussion and Outlook Section and [12] ). In the light of these observations, our analysis shows that the beat of the euglenid flagellum can be seen as an example of a biological function arising from the competition between antagonistic structural components. It is not dissimilar from the body-flagellum interaction in Trypanosoma, which generates 3d motility. But the principle is much more general in biology and many other examples can be found across kingdoms and species and at widely different scales. For instance in plants, a mechanism of seed dispersal arises from the mechanical competition between the two valves of the seed pods, see, e.g., [3] for Bauhinia variegata and [15] for Cardamine hirsuta. Contraction by antagonistic muscles is key for animal movement and, in particular, for the functioning of hydrostatic skeletons (used from wormlike invertebrates to arms and tentacles of cephalopods, to the trunk of elephants, see [16] ). A similar principle of antagonistic contraction along perpendicularly oriented families of fibers is at work at the sub-cellualr level, for example in the antagonistic motor protein dynamics in contractile ring structures important in cell division and development (see, e.g., [8] ). At the same sub-cellular scale, competing elastic forces arising from lipid-protein interactions are often crucial in determining the stability of complex shapes of the cellular membrane [31] , and in the case of the overall structure of the coronavirus envelope [29] .",

Swimming Euglenas follow generalized helical trajectories coupled with rotation around the major axis of the cell body. It is precisely this rotation that allows for a 3d reconstruction of flagellar shapes from 2d videomicroscopy images. Euglenas take many beats to close one complete turn around their major body axis. So, while rotating, Euglenas show their flagellar beat to the observer from many different sides. Stereomatching techniques can then be employed to reconstruct the flagellar beat in full (assuming periodicity and regularity of the beat). Figure 2 shows N = 10 different curves in space describing the euglenid flagellum in different instants within a beat taken from [25] . The reconstruction fits well experimental data from multiple specimens. The figure also illustrates the calculated torsion of the flagellar curve at each instant (not previously published). Torsion, the rate of change of the binormal vector, is the geometric quantity that measures the deviation of a curve from a planar path (see the Results Section below for the formal definition). The spinning lasso shows here a distinct torsional signature characterized by torsion peaks of alternate sign, traveling from the proximal to the distal end of the flagellum.",

In this setting the flagellum is not perturbed by the hydrodynamic forces associated with Euglena's rototranslating swimming motion. The beat can then manifest itself in its most \"pristine\" form. We recorded trapped Euglenas during periodic beating. Then, we rotated the capillary and recorded the same beating cell from different viewpoints. Videomicroscopy images from one specimen are shown in 4/24 . While with fixed specimens we cannot reconstruct reliably the 3d flagellar shapes, Figure 3 shows that there is a high stereographical consistency with the flagellar shapes obtained from swimming organisms. Flagellar non-planarity is thus not intrinsically associated with swimming, which reinforce the idea that the mechanism that generates non-planar flagellar shapes might be structural in origin. Moreover, these observations justify the choice we made in our study to focus on a model of flagellar mechanics for stationary organisms, allowing for substantial simplifications. As a final remark we observe how, from a simple geometric construction, we can show that the torsional pattern in Figure 2 is consistent with Euglena's flagellar shapes as seen from common 2d microscopy, for either swimming or trapped organisms. Typically, the 2d outline (i.e. the projection on the optic plane) of a beating euglenid flagellum is that of a looping curve, see e.g. [30] for independent observations. Consider now an idealized 3d model of the spinning lasso geometry: a curve with two singular points of concentrated torsion with opposite sign, such as the one shown in Figure 3 . If we move along the curve, from proximal end to distal end, we first remain on a fixed plane (blue). Then the plane of the curve abruptly rotates by 90 degrees (red plane) first, and then back by 90 degrees in the opposite direction (yellow plane). These abrupt changes correspond to concentrated torsional peaks of opposite sign. When seen in a two dimensional projection, this torsion dipole generates a looping curve that closely matches euglenid flagella's outlines during a spinning lasso beat.",

The bonding links of the PFR cross section centered at r p (s) are attached to three adjacent MTs at the same MTs' arc length s.

The torque depends on the integral of the bending vector, making the balance equations non-standard (integrodifferental instead of differential). This dependency is due to the fact that the torque arises from the shear deformations of the PFR, which are induced by the shear of axonemal MTs, which is, in turn, related to axonemal bending strains via the integral relations (6) .

We look at the equilibrium configurations for every possible value of the angle \u03c6 p between the Ax-PFR joining line and the spontaneous bending plane of the Ax, even though the value of actual interest for Euglena is \u03c6 p \u2248 \u22122\u03c0/9. We can prove analytically the following statement: if the Ax-PFR joining line is neither parallel nor orthogonal to the spontaneous bending plane of the Ax, then the emergent flagellar shapes are non-planar. Indeed, suppose H 1 = 0. From (20) and (21) it follows that the shape of the flagellum is planar \u03c4 = 0 if (and only if) the angle \u03c8 of the bending vector U(s) = (U 1 (s), U 2 (s)) is constant. The bending vector must therefore be confined on a line for every s. In this case there must be two constants c 1 and c 2 such that U 1 (s) = c 1 U (s) and U 2 (s) = c 2 U (s) for some scalar function U . Now, if a planar U is a 11/24 Figure 5 . Flagellar non-planarity arising from structural incompatibility. The Ax-PFR mechanical interplay is explained in a three-steps argument (left to right). Consider first the two separated structures in their spontaneous configurations (left). The Ax is bent into a planar arc while the PFR is straight. Then, the PFR is forced to match to the Ax, while the latter is kept in its spontaneous configuration (middle). The attachment constraint induces shear strains in the PFR. The composite system cannot then be in mechanical equilibrium without external forcing. When the composite system is released (right), it reaches equilibrium by the relaxation of the PFR shear, which induce additional distortion of the Ax. At equilibrium, an optimal energy compromise is reached, which is characterized by an emergent non-planarity.",

We can vary these material parameters and explore what the resulting minima of W, i.e. the equilibrium configurations (12)-(13), must look like. We consider the nondimensional parameter \u03bd = D p /(B a L \u22122 ). When \u03bd 1 the Ax component W a of the energy dominates.

In the intermediate case \u03bd \u223c 1 we expect the equilibrium configurations to be a compromise among the two extreme cases, with the bending vector U(s) being \"spread out\" in the region between the two extreme equilibrium lines. The spreading of the bending vector is aided by the concentrated shear force at the tip, which imposes U(L) = (0, U * 2 (L)) irrespectively of the PFR stiffness. The bending vector is then \"pinned\" at s = L on the U 1 = 0 line while it gets dragged toward the line generated by e \u22a5 p for large values of \u03bd. Hence the spreading. The bending vector will then span an area and, consequently, undergo rotations. Since torsion is determined by the rotation rate of the bending vector \u03c4 = \u2202 s \u03c8, the resulting flagellar shapes will be non-planar. Figure 6 illustrates a critical example in which the previous intuitive reasoning effectively plays out. We consider a target bending of the kind U * 2 (s) = A 0 + A 1 sin(2\u03c0s/L)), a fair idealization of the asymmetric shapes of a Chlamydomonas-like flagellar beat [10] . We take \u03c6 p = \u2212\u03c0/4 (larger than the Euglena value, to obtain clearer graphs). For \u03bd = 0 the bending vector lies inside the U 1 = 0 line, and its amplitude oscillates. For positive values of \u03bd, when the PFR stiffness is \"turned on\", the oscillating bending vector is extruded from the U 1 = 0 line. For large values of \u03bd it gets closer and closer to the line generated by e \u22a5 p . The bending vector spans an area and, following the oscillations, it rotates clock-wise and anti-clock-wise generating an alternation in the torsion sign. This is the geometric signature of the spinning lasso.",

Indeed, rotation allows cells to \"scan\" the environment, and veer to the light source direction when stimulated (or escape in the opposite direction, when the signal is too strong). Here, the key biochemical mechanism could be the one often found in nature, by which periodic signals generated by lighting and shading associated with body rotations are used for navigation, in the sense that the existence of periodicity implies a lack of proper alignment [12] .

            "text": "Figure 3. While with fixed specimens we cannot reconstruct reliably the 3d flagellar shapes, Figure 3 shows that there is a high stereographical consistency with the flagellar shapes obtained from swimming organisms. Flagellar non-planarity is thus not intrinsically associated with swimming, which reinforce the idea that the mechanism that generates non-planar flagellar shapes might be structural in origin. Moreover, these observations justify the choice we made in our study to focus on a model of flagellar mechanics for stationary organisms, allowing for substantial simplifications. As a final remark we observe how, from a simple geometric construction, we can show that the torsional pattern in Figure 2 is consistent with Euglena's flagellar shapes as seen from common 2d microscopy, for either swimming or trapped organisms. Typically, the 2d outline (i.e. the projection on the optic plane) of a beating euglenid flagellum is that of a looping curve, see e.g. [30] for independent observations. Consider now an idealized 3d model of the spinning lasso geometry: a curve with two singular points of concentrated torsion with opposite sign, such as the one shown in Figure 3. If we move along the curve, from proximal end to distal end, we first remain on a fixed plane (blue). Then the plane of the curve abruptly rotates by 90 degrees (red plane) first, and then back by 90 degrees in the opposite direction (yellow plane). These abrupt changes correspond to concentrated torsional peaks of opposite sign. When seen in a two dimensional projection, this torsion dipole generates a looping curve that closely matches euglenid flagella's outlines during a spinning lasso beat.",

We initiate the algorithm with u 0 = (0, u * 2 ), and then we iterate (54) until u n+1 \u2212 u n falls below a pre-set tolerance parameter.The dynamic equations (17) are recast, and then solved, in terms of the shear vector \u03b3 = (\u03b3 1 , \u03b3 2 ) whereAfter solving for \u03b3, we obtain the bending strains by differentiation. The equation for \u03b3 isand h = (h 1 , h 2 ). The corresponding boundary conditions are given bywhere\u0125 = (\u0125 1 ,\u0125 2 ). The above (57) are point-wise conditions, which do not involve integral terms as in (19) . Avoiding this non-locality allows for an easier numerical implementation. The finite difference scheme we employ to solve (56)-(57) is illustrated in the remainder. We consider the discrete time sequence y n = n\u2206y with n = 0, 1, 2, . . . and we defineand complemented by the boundary conditionsThe adimensional arc length interval [0, 1] is discretized uniformly in M + 1 points x k = k\u2206x , with k = 0, 1, . . . , M = 1/\u2206x. We also consider the extra \"ghost points\"x k = k\u2206x with k = \u22121, M + 1, M + 2. The discrete values \u2202 2 x \u03b3 n k = \u2202 2 x \u03b3 n (x k ) of the second derivative in (58) are approximated by the finite difference schemewhere \u03b3 n k = \u03b3 n (x k ). Analogous formulas are employed for the second derivative of h n . The discrete values \u2202 4x \u03b3 n+1 k = \u2202 4 x \u03b3 n+1 (x k ) of the forth derivative in (58) are given by the schemewhich involves the ghost points values \u03b3 \u22121 , \u03b3 M +1 , and \u03b3 M +2 .
