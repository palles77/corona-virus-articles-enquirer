This chapter discusses the nature of medical theories from the perspective of the philosophy, history, and psychology of science. I will review prominent philosophical accounts of what constitutes a scientific theory, and develop a new account of medical theories as representations of mechanisms that explain disease.",

Most importantly, it should contribute to understanding of medical explanation, both at the general level of causes of diseases and at the individual level of diagnosis of particular cases of a disease. Medical researchers seek to explain the causes of diseases such as tuberculosis, while physicians seek to identify diseases that explain symptoms such as fever. A medical theory such as the bacterial theory of tuberculosis provides good explanations at both the general and individual levels. The primary aim of this chapter is to show how these explanations work. A secondary aim is to show how an account of medical theories can shed light on other aspects of medical research and practice, including the nature of medical discovery, the process of evaluation of competing medical theories, and the ways in which effective treatments of disease depend on the development of good mechanistic theories about diseases. 48 P.

Until the advent of modern scientific medicine in the middle of the nineteenth century, the world's predominant medical theories attributed diseases to various kinds of bodily imbalances. In Europe, the humoral theory of disease originated with Hippocrates around 400 B.C. It held that diseases arise because of imbalances in the body's four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Treatment consisted of attempts to restore the proper balance by ridding the body of excessive quantities of blood, bile, or phlegm by techniques, such as bloodletting and purgatives.",

There are many problems with this syntactic account that I can mention only briefly. First, relationship between causes and diseases are rarely universal, because there are usually many interacting factors involved, some of them unknown. In contagious diseases, there are usually many more people infected by the relevant microorganism than those that come down with the disease. Second, universal generalisations are inadequate to characterise causality, because they cannot distinguish between cases where a generalisation is true accidentally and ones where it derives from underlying causal structure. Third, the syntactic view of theories assumes that explanation is a matter of logical deduction from universal generalisations, but it is rare outside physics for scientists to be able to generate deductive explanations. In medicine, there is rarely a tight deductive relationship between hypotheses about causes and the diseases they explain. Finally, the syntactic account of theories has nothing to say about how medical hypotheses can be discovered or about how they can be used to suggest treatments of disease.",

A model in the relevant sense is a structure consisting of a set of objects that provides an interpretation for sentences in a formal language. On this account, what matters about a theory is not its particular linguistic expression, but rather its specification of a set of models that are intended to include the world. The model-theoretic account is difficult to apply to medical theories because they are rarely susceptible to formalisation. Moreover, this account has nothing to say about the nature of explanation, causality, discovery, and treatment. Hence it is clear that we need a richer conception of medical theories.",

            "text": "In 1962, Thomas Kuhn published The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which introduced the term paradigm into the philosophy and history of science. Should we consider a medical theory as a paradigm? Kuhn's use of the term was notoriously vague, but he eventually identified two key senses, as a world view and as a set of exemplars, which are standard examples of problem solutions (Kuhn, 1977) . Neither of these senses applies well to medical theories. Even the most general medical theory, the germ theory of disease, does not constitute a world view, and it is not evident what in medical science constitutes an exemplar. Kuhn had some important insights about scientific theories as a part of conceptual systems and about the magnitude of conceptual change in the development of knowledge, but these can be pursued more fruitfully within the cognitive account of theories discussed in the next section. Karl Popper's (1959) early work in the philosophy of science was similar to the logical positivist's view of theories as syntactic structures. But he later proposed that theories are part of a third world of intelligibles distinct from the first world of physical objects and the second world of mental states. The third world is \"the world of possible objects of thought; the world of theories in themselves, and their logical relations; of arguments in themselves; of problem situations in themselves\" (Popper, 1972, p. 154) . I fail to see, however, what is gained by postulating this mysterious additional world. In accord with contemporary cognitive science, I would deny even the division between Popper's first and second worlds: mental states are physical states of the brain. Moreover, Popper's treatment of theories as abstract entities in an autonomous world sheds no light on questions of evaluation, causality, and discovery, and we have already seen reasons to doubt the deductive view of explanation that Popper assumes. Hence I will now turn to what I think is a more plausible view of medical theories.",

The traditional view of concepts is that they are defined by necessary and sufficient conditions, so that we would have a definition of the form: person P has SARS if and only if P has the symptoms X, Y, and Z. There is abundant psychological evidence, however that the traditional view does not adequately characterise mental concepts (Murphy, 2002) . A prominent alternative theory of concepts is that they consist of prototypes that describe typical rather than universal features of the objects that fall under a concept. Accordingly, we should think of a disease concept as involving the specification of a set of typical features involving symptoms as well as the usual course of the disease. Here is an approximate prototype for SARS, in the form of a structure that artificial intelligence researchers frame:",

Now we get to the hard part: how does the mind represent cause? Philosophers have attempted to give verbal reconstructions of the concept of causality, from Hume on constant conjunction to Kant on the causal schema to modern philosophers who have tried to tie causality to probability theory. I suspect that all these attempts have failed to characterise causal knowledge because they neglect the fact that people's understanding of causality is also multimodal. I do not know whether this understanding is innate or learned very early, but people acquire or instantiate the concept of causality through non-verbal perceptual experiences, including ones that are visual, tactile, and kinesthetic (Michotte, 1963) . Even infants have strong expectations about what they can expect to see and what they can expect to happen when they interact with the world. Baillargeon, et al. (1995) report that infants as young as 2.5 months expect a stationary object to be displaced when it is hit by a moving object. By around 6 months, infants believe that the distance traveled by the stationary object is proportional to the sise of the moving object. Thus at a very primitive stage of verbal development children seem to have some understanding of causality based on their visual and tactile experiences.",

My multimodal hypothesis suggests how this appreciation of causal powers may operate in the mind. Children know little about logic and probability, but they quickly acquire a sense of what it is for one event to make another happen.

Cognitive science is replete with detailed computational theories of the acquisition of concepts, so the cognitive approach can easily address the problem of understanding how medical theories are discovered. Similarly, there is a well-developed psychological theory and computational model of explanatory coherence that describes how competing theories can be evaluated using artificial neural networks (Thagard, 1992) . This leaves the major problem of saying how the cognitive conception of theories can shed light on the nature of medical explanation, which requires attention to the topic of mechanisms.

I prefer the term \"part\" to \"entity\" because it indicates that the objects in a mechanism are part of a larger system; and I prefer \"interaction\" and \"change\" to \"activity\" because they sound less anthropomorphic. More importantly, I find the reference to start and finish conditions highly misleading, because the biochemical mechanisms needed to explain biological functioning often involve ongoing feedback processes rather than unidirectional changes.

For the SARS coronavirus, the envelope carries three glycoproteins, including a spike protein that enables the virus to bind to the cell receptors. Once a virus has attached itself to a cell, it enters it and releases its genetic instructions that recruit the cell's enzymes to make parts for new viruses.

Schematically, these two mechanisms are: Obviously, these mechanisms of disease symptom causation can be broken down much further by specifying the relevant parts, such as the proteins responsible for viral replication and the autoimmune cells that attack viruses, and the relevant processes, such as cell destruction and autoimmune responses. These two kinds of mechanisms, in company with the mechanisms of viral activity, together explain how viruses such as the SARS-CoV cause diseases like SARS.

But no single human being has the time, energy, or memory capacity to learn even just the metabolic pathways for a simple organisms such as E. coli: the EcoCyc database contains information on 4363 E. coli genes, 165 pathways, and 2604 chemical reactions (Karp et al., 2002) . Hence the biochemical understanding of any disease by a human scientist needs to be supplemented by access to computer databases that describe genes, proteins, and their interactions. Because biomedical mechanisms are being represented in computer databases, and not minds or books, the representation of the mechanisms for understanding diseases are distributed among various human minds and computers. Giere (2002) reached a similar conclusion about physics, arguing that research in high-energy physics is performed by a complex cognitive system consisting of an accelerator, detectors, computers, and all the people working on an experiment. Accordingly, I propose my final analysis of the nature of medical theories: Analysis 4\" A medical theory is a representation, possibly distributed among human minds and computer databases, of mechanisms whose proper and improper functioning generate the states and symptoms of a disease. Analysis 4 does not contradict any of the previous 3 analyses offered above, but it expands them to allow the increasing role of bioinformatics in medical theorising. I have added the clause about \"proper and improper functioning\" to indicate that explanations of disease presuppose a background of normal biological operation that has broken down.",

Depending on the problem and audience at hand, a medical explanation may operate at a superficial level, for example when physicians tell ordinary patients how they got sick. But explanation is not merely pragmatic: it should draw on established knowledge of mechanisms described at the level of detail appropriate for the task at hand. The most important task in medical research after determining the causes of diseases is developing treatments for them. Whereas drug discovery used to be largely a matter of serendipity or exhaustive search, current pharmaceutical research is based on deep understanding of the molecular bases of disease. Once investigators have identified how defective pathways lead to various diseases, they can search selectively for drugs that correct the defects .",

Psychology and the other fields of cognitive science have contributed to powerful theories of mental representation and processing, for example, theories of concepts, rules, images, and neural networks (Thagard, 2005) . But here are some difficult unanswered questions that are crucial to further our understanding of how minds do medicine: 1. How do brains represent changes of the sort that mechanisms produce? 2. How do brains operate cooperatively with multimodal representations, for example combining verbal and visual information? 3. How do brains accomplish an innate or learned intuitive understanding of causality that emanates from integrated multimodal representations? 4. What would it take for computers to be able not only to contain information about genes, proteins, and pathways, but also to use that information to reason about them in order to generate explanations and treatments? Thus there is much work to be done to develop the cognitive conception of medical theories from a philosophical account into a full-fledged psychological/computational theory of medical reasoning.",
