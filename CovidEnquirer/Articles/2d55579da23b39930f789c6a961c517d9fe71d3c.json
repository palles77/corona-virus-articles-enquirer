The highest correlation between rectal and infrared temperatures was observed when temperatures were above physiological levels. IRT discriminated between febrile and non-febrile sheep with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 97%. The results showed that eye temperature measured using IRT was a useful non-invasive method for the assessment of fever in sheep infected with BTV under experimental conditions. Further research is required to evaluate the use of IRT under field conditions to identify potentially infected animals in bluetongue surveillance programmes.",

This radiation is proportional to the surface temperature of the body (Bitar et al., 2009) , and is evaluated using a thermographic camera, which produces images with different colour patterns depending on the temperature of the imaged objects. The temperature values in the images are strongly related to the emissivity of the object, which is defined as the relative ability of a surface to emit and absorb radiation (Rodr\u00edguez-Prieto et al., 2013) . As up to 60% of heat loss of an animal may occur in the infrared range, radiated heat loss could be used as an early indicator of fever in pathological conditions .",

The ability of the IRT to detect febrile animals with minimal handling suggests its potential as a useful tool in both veterinary preventive medicine and experimental diseases models (Schaefer et al., 2004 (Schaefer et al., , 2012 Rainwater-Lovett et al., 2009) . Bluetongue (BT) is a non-contagious, vector-borne disease of domestic and wild ruminants. It is caused by an orbivirus belonging to the family Reoviridae; so far 26 different serotypes have been identified (Hofmann et al., 2008; Maan et al., 2011) . The disease is of economic importance due to losses associated with mortality and morbidity, veterinary treatment, implementation of control and eradication programmes and commercial restrictions in infected areas (Velthuis et al., 2010) . The severity of BT varies according to species, breed and bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype. Sheep have been considered the most severely affected livestock species and typical clinical symptoms include apathy, generalized subcutaneous oedema (mainly observed on the head, intermandibular area and neck), nasal discharge, oral lesions, cyanotic tongue, dyspnoea and lameness (Schwartz-Cornil et al., 2008; Maclachlan et al., 2009) . However, fever is the main clinical sign of BT in sheep and the earliest to be detected (Hamblin et al., 1998; Worwa et al., 2010; Perez de Diego et al., 2011) .",

In agreement with previous studies (Stubsjoen et al., 2009) due to the absence of wool, the eye and surrounding skin area, appeared to be the anatomical location of choice for the measurement of temperature by IRT during our experiment. Indeed, the highest face temperature is often found in the eye, which is believed to reflect internal body temperature (Kastberger and Stachl, 2003) . In contrast with other areas free of wool, such as the hoof (which could also be influenced by different environmental factors such as soil moisture, presence of straw, and mud), the eye region presents better accessibility, and is easier for the interpretation of changes in temperature.",

However, a significant positive correlation between the true positive cases (rectal temperature >40\u00b0C) and their equivalent IRT data (infrared temperature >38.54\u00b0C) was observed, while the correlation between true negatives cases was much lower. Thus, the highest correlation between rectal and infrared temperatures was found when temperatures above the physiological range were presented, suggesting that both methods were of similar effectiveness when fever was present.",

The study represents the first step in the validation of IRT as a method for measuring fever, which is considered to be the main and earliest clinical sign in sheep infected with BTV and is closely related to the viraemia that plays a relevant role in BTV epidemiology and diagnosis. Eye temperature measured using IRT may be a useful non-invasive method for the assessment of fever in sheep infected with BTV under experimental and field conditions, reducing the animal stress and, in consequence, its influence on different biological parameters involved in inflammatory or immunological responses. Further research is needed to establish better validation in field conditions as well as to improve correlation, specificity and sensitivity.",
