But virus discovery competes with all other areas of medicine, so it is fitting to recognize two of the most important viral pathogens together. HIV-1 and human papilloma viruses of the uterine cervix (HPV-16 and HPV-18) cause immense morbidity and mortality; both are sexually transmitted and both establish life-long, persistent infections. HPV represents a new discovery of an ancient infection whereas HIV-1 is new to humans, the latest data (Worobey et al., 2008) refining Bette Korber's previous estimate of an origin of the pan-demic strain 75-100 years ago. The discovery of HPV eventually led to excellent prophylactic vaccines, whereas the discovery of HIV-1 led to effective antiviral drugs but, alas, no safe and efficacious vaccine is yet in sight.",

He was the first scientist to develop molecular probes for human viruses, demonstrating in 1970 the presence of EBV DNA in Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. After his return to Germany in 1974, zur Hausen used DNA hybridization and restriction enzyme polymorphisms to initiate the numerical system of HPV typing and to classify HPV strains in plantar and flat warts (HPV-1 to -4). In 1972, an association of papilloma viruses with skin cancer in epidermodysplasia verruciformis had been proposed by Stefania Jablonska in Poland, and in 1978 she and Gerard Orth at the Pasteur Institute discovered HPV-5 in this skin cancer using zur Hausen's methods.",

Having cloned these genomes, they used an HPV-6 probe to detect DNA of another strain (HPV-11) in laryngeal tumors, genital condylomas, and a small proportion of cervical cancer specimens. Then they exploited low stringency hybridization to HPV-11 to identify a new genome, HPV-16, present in 11 out of 18 cervical carcinomas (D\u00fcrst et al., 1983) . The subsequent identification of HPV-18 increased this association and revealed the persistence of HPV-18 in cervical tumor cell lines such as HeLa (Boshart et al., 1984) . Further oncogenic strains such as HPV-31 and HPV-45 were detected, and today >99.7% of cervical cancers worldwide are known to carry one or more strains of HPV.",

The vaccines are highly effective against HPV-16 and -18 and thus can prevent ~70% of cervical HPV infections. They are based on the self-assembly of the viral capsid protein L1 into virus-like particles pioneered by Doug Lowy and John Schiller at NIH, and by Jian Zhou and Ian Frazer in Brisbane ( Figure 1A ). zur Hausen's success in identifying noncultivatable, new human papilloma viruses by DNA cloning led to the identification by molecular techniques of other human viral pathogens, such as hepatitis C virus in 1989 and Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) in 1994. Unknown and unexpected viruses, such as the SARS coronavirus outbreak in 2003, have been rapidly characterized thanks to modern cloning and sequencing technology.

In fact, thanks to superb epidemiological investigations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, by early 1983 we already knew much about the risk factors associated with AIDS; all that was missing was the infective agent itself. Various microbes were mooted, including DNA viruses, RNA viruses, and a fungus secreting an immunosuppressive molecule like cyclosporin.",

Inevitably, those who champion unsuccessful nominees cry \"if only.\" If the Committee had decided to recognize human retroviruses, Gallo's discovery of HTLV-I (Poiesz et al., 1980) would stand alongside Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi's and Montagnier's discovery of HIV. The discovery of HTLV-I came 18 months before the beautiful work of Isao Miyoshi and Yorio Hinuma in Japan, who showed its causal link to adult T cell leukemia. On the other hand, had the Committee been minded to recognize the discovery of human oncogenic viruses, Gallo and Sir Anthony Epstein (who detected EBV in 1964) might have joined zur Hausen. The Committee stated that zur Hausen \"went against current dogma and postulated that HPV caused cervical cancer\" (although Orth had proposed the same). Likewise, many scientists thought that Epstein and Gallo were wasting their time searching for oncogenic viruses in humans. Either way, Gallo had a nearmiss, which he has taken graciously.",

In contrast, the Pasteur Institute's team was unencumbered by this mindset. Following their first HIV-1 isolate from a patient with lymphadenopathy ( Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi et al., 1983) , they published on further isolates from AIDS patients (Vilmer et al., 1984) and noted their resemblance to a lentivirus (Montagnier et al., 1984) before Gallo and Levy reported their findings. Montagnier's team was also the first to isolate HIV-1 from African patients (Ellrodt et al., 1984) and later discovered HIV-2 in West Africa (Clavel et al., 1986) . Nonetheless, it was Gallo's four papers in May 1984 that persuaded the world that the AIDS culprit really had been found. Gallo has continued to provide innovation and insight into HIV-1 and AIDS to this day.",

However, only one Nobel Prize has been awarded for a viral vaccine, to Max Theiler in 1951 for \"his discoveries concerning yellow fever and how to combat it.\" To ambitious young investigators, I would say: tackle the big sci-entific questions but do not chase elusive prizes.

One could argue that the very first award in 1901 to Emil von Behring for diphtheria serum therapy should have been shared with Shibasaburo Kitasato because the development of antitoxin to tetanus by Kitasato and Behring preceded that of diphtheria; yet the Nobel Committee chose diphtheria alone, probably because it was the more feared disease. The 1902 Prize recognized Ronald Ross for demonstrating in 1898 that avian malaria can be transmitted by mosquitoes but astonishingly (in retrospect) omitted Gianni-Battista Grassi in Italy who contemporaneously identified the mosquito vectors of human malaria. It is a sobering thought that among the 192 Nobel Laureates in Medicine, three at most are household names: Sir Alexander Fleming, Jim Watson, and Francis Crick.",

Previously, Loeffler had discovered the diphtheria bacterium and precisely enunciated the postulates that he ascribed to his mentor, Robert Koch. I wonder about Sir Christopher Andrewes, who identified human influenza virus in 1933. Alick Isaacs, like Proust and Kafka, sadly died too soon after his and Jean Lindermann's discovery of interferon in 1957 to gain recognition. This finding of an innate antiviral response was also the first discovery of a cytokine, long before the interleukins. Perhaps the most notable achievement in overcoming infectious disease during the Nobel era was the eradication of smallpox in 1977 by the WHO team led by Donald Henderson; it cannot qualify for a Nobel Prize in Medicine because it was not a discovery, so a Peace Prize would be apt.",

Again, the discovery of H. pylori and its association with peptic and duodenal ulcers, stomach cancer, and later mucosal-associated B cell tumors went against prevailing concepts. There was no strong epidemiological evidence to suggest that these diseases had an infectious etiology. Marshall applied Koch's postulates to himself: he swallowed a pure culture of bacteria and developed severe dyspepsia. It took over a decade for Warren and Marshall to convince physicians (let alone pharmaceutical companies) that inexpensive antibiotics, which eliminate the underlying cause of disease, were more effective than the sophisticated H 2 -receptor antagonists, which help to control the symptoms.",
