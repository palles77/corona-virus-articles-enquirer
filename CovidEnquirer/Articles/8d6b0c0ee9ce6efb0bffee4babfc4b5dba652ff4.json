Viruses can also emerge unnaturally, either directly (e.g., bioterrorist attacks) or accidentally (e.g., laboratory infections). Despite these possibilities of virus emergence, 60% of emerging viruses have a zoonotic origin, thus highlighting transmission from animals to humans as a major threat to public health (2) . Whenever viruses emerge, prompt identification of the agent and implementation of control measures to contain the outbreak are required.",

However, for clinical specimens, such as blood, other fluids, or infected organ tissues, successful detection of viruses is less likely because virus-to-host genome ratios are insufficient (3) (4) (5) (6) . Use of tissues from persons with suspected infections for virus detection enables elucidation of infection directly at the site of viral replication. Although detecting viruses directly from infected organ tissue provides obvious and valuable advantages, reliable purification of viruses directly from tissues still remains a challenge.",

A total of 2 mL of K8N random primers and 3.2 mL of dNTPs were added to the 30 mL of RNA and heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min before quenching on ice. The remaining contents of the mixture were heated at 42\u00b0C for 60 min before the enzyme was inactivated at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. Double-stranded cDNA was produced by mixing 2 mL of K8N random primers, 3 mL of Klenow buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and 2 mL (2.5 mmol/L) of dNTPs with 19 mL of cDNA. The mixture was heated at 95\u00b0C for 2 min and cooled to 4\u00b0C. A total of 1.67 mL of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs) was added and the mixture was at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. Double-stranded cDNA was purified by using the MSB Spin PCRapace Purification Kit (Invitek, Berlin, Germany) and an elution volume of 30 mL. Random amplification was performed by using the procedures reported by Stang and Korn (7). Successful random amplification (a 200-2,000-bp smear) was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis of 10 mL of PCR product. The duration of this procedure was \u22484.5 h.
