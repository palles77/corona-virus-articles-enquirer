This strain remained the dominant influenza strain across Europe in 2013, and the emerging H7N9 strain provides further cause for immediate concern. 6 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) arose in China in 2002 and rapidly caused over 8000 cases with case fatality rate of almost 10%, 7 and the emergence in 2013 of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has caused global concern. 8 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is estimated to cause each year 33 million new episodes of acute lower respiratory tract infection worldwide in children younger than 5 years, and up to an estimated 199 000 deaths per year -almost all of which are in low-income settings. 9 The variable coverage of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is well documented, 10 and measles is still responsible for considerable disease burden globally (14.8 million DALYs in 2010). 1 Pertussis has received media coverage in high-income countries, 11 and respiratory infections have elsewhere been implicated in the aetiology of chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, 12 chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder 13 and cystic fibrosis, 14 as well as acting as a trigger for acute cardiovascular events. 15 UK institutions have received an estimated \u00a32.6 billion of public and charitable funding to carry out infectious disease research between 1997 and 2010, 16 and according to estimates from Policy Cures, the UK ranks second globally in terms of the amount of research and development (R&D) funding for infectious disease research. 17 Funding covers all types of science along the R&D value chain from preclinical to operational and implementation research. We report on the funding for respiratory infection-related research awarded to UK institutions. We identify areas of research strength and possible investment gaps in relation to respiratory global health that will be of relevance to policy-makers, funders and researchers, and briefly discuss how new approaches might help with allocating the existing resources and identifying new sources of investment.",

Studies were also allocated to one of four categories along the R&D value chain: preclinical; phase 1, 2 or 3; product development; and implementation and operational research. 19 Funders were either considered in their own right, or were grouped into categories, such as in-house university funding, research charities and government departments. A total of 26 funder categories were used. 19 This categorisation was carried out by author MGH, with provisional datasets circulated to authors for review and comment, and JRF, MKC and FBW further verified a random sample of 10% of the dataset, with author agreement measured by a \u03ba score (0.95) and differences settled by consensus. We excluded studies not immediately relevant to infection, veterinary infectious disease research studies (unless there was a clear zoonotic component) and studies where there were UK collaborators, but the funding was awarded to a non-UK institution. Unfunded studies were also excluded. Grants awarded in a currency other than pounds sterling were converted to UK pounds using the mean exchange rate in the year of the award. All awards were adjusted for inflation and reported in 2010 UK pounds. Relative levels of investment were presented via a '\u00a3 per DALY' figure; this represented the total investment in research per one DALY. The DALY figures were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease study. 1 We used fold differences and statistical tests (nonparametric Mann-Whitney rank sum test, K-sample test and non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test) to compare total investment, number of studies, mean grant and median grant according to specific infection, disease system, funding organisation and cross-cutting categories. Associations between disease burden and research investment were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r). A value greater or equal to 0.7 was considered strongly correlated, greater or equal to 0.40 and less than 0.70 was considered moderately correlated and a value under or equal to 0.40 was considered poorly correlated. Data management was carried out in Microsoft Excel and Access (versions 2000 and 2007) and statistical analysis with Stata (V.11).",

Of the 6165 studies, 1192 were identified as relevant to respiratory infection research with a total funding of \u00a3418. 8 By disease (table 1) , tuberculosis received \u00a3155.3 million across 329 studies, influenza \u00a380.1 million across 141 studies and pneumonia \u00a327.8 million across 102 studies. Preclinical science received the most investment in these disease areas (tuberculosis 57.8%, influenza 72.3% and pneumonia 87.5%, see online supplementary data). Other respiratory diseases received substantially less funding, and investments were heavily concentrated within preclinical science-for example, RSV (total \u00a316.9 million of which 80.3% was preclinical) and Pseudomonas research (total \u00a36.5 million, preclinical 90.3%). The sum of coronavirus research covered just six studies, all of them being preclinical. Research relating to infections in chronic respiratory disease (mostly cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and asthma) totalled \u00a38.9 million across 57 studies. Table 2 provides the breakdown of funding for other selected disciplines of importance, and here reported specific to respiratory infectious disease. Vaccine-related studies received \u00a351.9 million across 151 studies with \u00a319.1 million for tuberculosis and \u00a310.9 million for influenza vaccine research. Therapeutics-related research received \u00a339.3 million, with \u00a321.5 million for tuberculosis and \u00a31.6 million for influenza research. Diagnostics-related research received \u00a318.0 million, with \u00a310.0 million to tuberculosis and \u00a35.6 million for influenza diagnostics. Furthermore, there were 43 studies totalling \u00a314.5 million on antimicrobial resistance, 49 studies totalling \u00a310.2 million on primary care research and 76 studies totalling \u00a321.7 million relating to paediatrics. Health economics and cost-effectiveness studies received funding of \u00a31.7 million.",

The Wellcome Trust provided most of the investment for tuberculosis research and cross-cutting themes including vaccinology, therapeutics and global health. The MRC was the top funder for influenza, and the European Commission was the top funder for diagnostics. Where data are available, the global burden of disease in DALYs was correlated with levels of research investment (figure 2, table 3); using 2004 DALYs as the mid-point of the study timeframe, there is an overall investment of \u00a34.28 per DALY for respiratory infections as a whole and \u00a34.54 per DALY for tuberculosis, with relatively less investment for measles (\u00a30.34), pertussis (\u00a30.25) and diphtheria (\u00a30.81). Relative investment in respiratory infectious diseases was strongly correlated with disease burden (DALYs) in 2010 (Spearman's r 0.8571, p=0.0625). Pneumonia is arguably, currently, the most neglected respiratory discipline in terms of R&D investment, with the UK demonstrating relatively greater investments in influenza and tuberculosis ",

We quantify research funding for preclinical science and translational types of research, with relatively little amount spent on phase 1-3 clinical trials and product development studies. Over half of the research funding was for tuberculosis and influenza. Vaccine development and global health studies form a key part of the UK research output, although there is proportionately less global health research within respiratory infectious disease than across all infectious disease. During this study period, there were increases in influenza research funding but very limited funding for emerging infections such as coronaviruses. There is some evidence of increased funding over time, although sum funding per annum is unpredictable, and the decline since 2008 may reflect global economic conditions. Tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia received increased investment in 2005-2010 as compared with 1997-2004; this may be due to a more systematic approach to collecting burden data, and thus translating into R&D investments. The focus on influenza will likely have been at least in part due to the highlighting of emerging strains with pandemic potential. The strong correlation between burden and investment is encouraging with, broadly, the highburden diseases receiving greater funding ( pneumonia being the key exception), and lower-burden infections less funding. Within therapeutics research, the proportionately greater investment for tuberculosis compared with influenza seems appropriate, as does the tuberculosis-related focus within diagnostics.",

            "text": "New high-impact infection threats to humans are often related to respiratory systems. From SARS to influenza to Middle East respiratory syndrome, these have the potential to be highly virulent with rapid transmission and global spread, and with substantial health and economic impact. Although difficult to accurately quantify, in our dataset there was little funding for research to develop predictive epidemiological models for future pandemics-which would be an important part of infection prevention and control. However, caution must be exercised when developing these epidemiological models using limited datasets. 20 Investment for data collection, predictive modelling (with analysis of health and economic impact with and without interventions) should be a priority for funders, along with investments in preclinical science and clinical trials. The lack of investment for coronavirus-related research across all types of science is particularly concerning (though some surveillance and research in response to outbreaks will not necessarily receive formal funding, and thus may not be captured by our analysis). The 2011 Pseudomonas outbreak and deaths in a neonatal unit in Northern Ireland 21 further highlight the need for research for prevention of nosocomial outbreaks related to respiratory infectious disease. There was limited funding for pneumococcal and pneumonia research. While infections such as meningitis may be in decline in some countries due to successful introduction of new vaccines, 22 there are still many areas globally with weak health systems where pneumococcal incidence is high. There is also evidence of respiratory infection transmission at mass gatherings, such as the Hajj. 23 In addition to providing meningococcal and influenza vaccination for travellers, there should be investment in operational research to explore health system responsiveness to emerging threats and efficient ways to provide preventive medicines, as well as measuring the effectiveness of preventive therapies. There was very little funding for translational research relating to pneumonia, a clear gap in the UK portfolio. Other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis, which are causes of high disease burden globally, also received very limited research funding despite there clearly being the need for translational and operational research. 16 The worldwide burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis is rapidly increasing, with WHO estimates of 630 000 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide, great variation between countries and emergence over the last decade of extensively drug-resistant cases. 24 Given the difficulties of developing a more effective vaccine, 25 the need for new diagnostics, therapeutics and targeted use of existing medicines becomes even more important. The reported resistance to antiviral drugs used to treat influenza 26 emphasises the need to develop effective antivirals and effective vaccines. There is a paucity of research in antimicrobial resistance. 27 This is of concern, and has been highlighted by the UK Chief Medical Officer, 28 29 with new funding for research related to antimicrobial resistance provided. 30 We believe that other funders should follow this lead. Most countries are underinvesting in tuberculosis R&D 31 which requires additional investment if drug-resistant tuberculosis is to be contained.",

Such considerations may include the prevalence and predicted impact of the disease, how treatable the disease is (antibiotic courses and combinations are very different between pneumonia and tuberculosis), cofactors and comorbities (eg, tuberculosis and coinfection with HIV), consideration of how other types of research may impact and inform the issues of controlling spread of respiratory infectious disease (eg, basic immunology research may eventually inform future vaccine development) and anticipation of future new tools, technologies or research methods.

We rely on the original data being complete and accurate, and are unable to take into account distribution of funds from the lead institution to collaborating partners, nor can we assess quantity of each award given to overheads or the impact of the introduction of full-economic costing. Also, assigning studies to categories is a subjective and imperfect process-although we used two researchers to do this to reduce interobserver error. Our study focuses on UK-led investments-we do not know whether similar patterns (eg, a dominance of preclinical research and lack of public or charitably funded clinical trials) would also emerge if the analysis were repeated for other highincome countries.
