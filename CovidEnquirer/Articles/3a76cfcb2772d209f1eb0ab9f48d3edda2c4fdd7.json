            "text": "Background and objectives: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2014 was associated with high public anxiety in the affected countries. Media speculations may have increased this psychological distress. The healthcare community was the most distressed because they were at the highest risk of infection. This study is the first to explore MERS-CoV epidemic impact on medical students' perception and determinants of their psychological distress during this outbreak. Methods: We randomly selected and surveyed 200 students from the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A predesigned questionnaire was answered by participants, and the collected data were statistically analyzed. Results: One hundred and seventy-four (87%) responded. Female students had a significantly higher mean stress level than males (P < 0.001). Participants had a mean GAD score of 2.7 \u00b1 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 \u00b1 4.2 and 18 respectively). College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%). One hundred and thirty-four (77%) reported minimal anxiety, thirty-two (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). The stress level (as reported on 1-10 scale) shows significant correlation with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. We found in this study that significant predictors in our model, in terms of more significant to the least, were: an increased self-report on hygienic habits, self-reported social avoidance, the generalized anxiety score and finally being female gander while other variables including numbers of resources access, agreeing with public fear and knowledge score on MERS-CoV all were found to be non-significant. However, the number of accessed resources, as per students, has borderline significant correlation with higher self-reported anxiety from MERS-CoV. Conclusions: Medical students' psychological needs during the MERS-CoV outbreak should be addressed appropriately. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs for medical students during an infectious disease outbreak. \u00a9 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences.

Saudi Arabia has had the vast majority of cases, with decreasing mortality over the years starting from 45% in 2014 to 41% in 2015, while in a recent study in 2017-2018, the mortality rate was 30.5% [3] .

Multiple Response Dichotomy Analysis was utilized for multiple response items and correlations (Pearson's r product correlation) for relationships/dependency. Moreover, the summative scale estimation relied on at least 0.6 Cronbach's alpha between scale items to compute the total scores of existing constructs. A Linear regression model with the criterion of stress level (1-10 score) to test the relationship between the outcome variable of stress and the variant which included main composite-summated-scores of GAD, knowledge score, self-reported hygienic habits improvement score, perceived sufficiency of information, the total number of accessed resources and social avoidance. Predictors also included the gender of the student and their seniority level. Alpha significance level was set to 0.05. The summated scores for both social avoidance and change in hygienic habits were made from items that were found internally consistent after doing reliability testing for their grouped items; the same was applied to GAD score. For hygienic habits score, it had an alpha Cronbach of 0.74, and it included three variables (Increased compliance with hand hygiene, increased buying of sanitizers, and overall increased compliance with universal precautions). For the social avoidance summated score, it had alpha Cronbach's of 0.72, and it included two variables only (social visits limitations and avoiding handshaking). Regarding the GAD-7 score, it had alpha Cronbach of 0.811. The sufficiency of information also has an overall alpha Cronbach's of 0.77, and it included all the questions. However, the agreeability on public fear score had an overall weak Cronbach's alpha of 0.53 with the four items included, one item was dropped, and the Cronbach's alpha Improved to 0.58. Statistical tests for normality, homogeneity of variance, and visual depiction of covariates and the dependent variable were evaluated, only the GAD required square root transformation when fitted into the linear regression model. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of participants. Out of the 174 respondents, 105 (60.3%) were males. Female students had an overall higher mean stress level than males (Mean \u00b1 SD was 5.61 \u00b1 1.65 and 4.56 \u00b1 1.63 respectively), and the difference was found significant in a Mann-Whitney U non-parametric test (U = 4847.7, P < 0.001). Ninety-eight out of 174 (56.3%) were senior students, and junior students 76 (43.7%) reported more stress than seniors ; however, the difference was non-significant (U = 3283, P = 0.176). Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics of the questioned variables. Participant students had mean GAD score of 2.7 \u00b1 3.1 and a median of 2. Perceived sufficiency of information score was the highest mean and median (17.4 \u00b1 4.2 and 18 respectively), while the number of resources accessed had the lowest mean and median (2.5 \u00b1 1.1 and 3 respectively). Fig. 1 shows the percentages of different information resources among participants. College and hospital announcements were the most common source of information (25.4%), followed by official statements or press releases from MOH (22.8%), and the third most common were social networks, mainly Facebook and WhatsApp (19.1%). Other resources for information were: other web resources (13.4%), WHO website (11%), and MOH website (8.3%). Fig. 2 shows the percentages of the GAD-7 anxiety levels category among surveyed students. Out of the 174 respondents, 134 (77%) reported minimal anxiety, 32 (18.4%) reported mild anxiety, 8 (4.6%) reported moderate anxiety, and none of them reported severe anxiety (score >14). Table 3 shows the correlation between stress level and continuous predictors included in the model. The stress level (as reported on 1-10 scale) shows a significant correlation with GAD-7 score and moderate correlation with both social avoidance and hygienic habit change (r = 0.41 and r = 0.471, respectively), and both were statistically significant. Independently, both social avoidance scores and personal hygienic habits show a significant correlation to each other. Table 4 shows the linear regression model predicting stress level of students as measured on 1-10 points. The model showed that 61.7 % of the variations in the students reported anxiety levels from contacting MERS-CoV (Multiple R = \u2212 0.617), which is equivalent to an adjusted R squared of 38.1%. The model suggested that at least one or more of the predictors had a significant relationship with the student's levels of anxiety [F(8165) = 12.71, <0.001]. The student's improvised hygienic habits score correlated significantly with the student's reported level. Also, the students reported social avoidance score converged significantly with the students reported anxiety score when considering all other variables jointly. Those were followed by the GAD score, which shows significant correlation with the student's reported anxiety from the MERS-CoV when all the other variables were controlled.",
