Among the IBV structural proteins, the spike glycoprotein S1 subunit is responsible for attachment to the host cellular membrane, induction of neutralization, and hemagglutination of inhibiting antibodies (Casais et al., 2003; Cavanagh, 2007) . Because of the high rates of S1 gene mutation, a number of IBV serotypes or antigenic variant strains have been reported in many countries (Cavanagh, 2007) . Moreover, another evolutionary process involving recombination between co-circulating heterotypic IBV strains has increased the genetic diversity of IBV viruses (Lee and Jackwood, 2000) . However, not all recombinant strains of IBV cause epidemics. While most recombinant strains have disappeared due to the unfitness for the host environment, some strains, such as GA98 strain derived from DE072 , have continuously persisted in the field long enough to maintain an epidemic .",

Despite extensive vaccination, IBV infection has remained a problem in the Korean poultry industry (Lee et al., 2004) . Since the early 1990s, Korean nephropathogenic IBV, represented by the KM91 strain, has exacted economic losses in Korea (Kim et al., 2004) . New nephropathogenic IBVs related to the QXIBV strain originating from China have been introduced and become wide-spread since 2000 (Lee et al., 2008) . More recently, we isolated new IBV strains that formed a new gene cluster in the phylogenetic tree of the IBV S1 gene. These new strains have been continuously isolated in Korea over time and outbreaks have been increasing annually. Nevertheless, the genetic features of these IBV strains are still unknown.",

All isolates were propagated in 10-day-old specific-pathogen free embryonated The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is continuously evolving through point mutation and recombination of their genome, subsequently the emergence of IBV variants complicates disease control. The objective of this study was to investigate genetic characterization of new IBV variants isolated from commercial chicken flocks in Korea collected between 2005 and 2010. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all new IBV isolates belonged to Korean group II (K-II), which included the nephropathogenic IBV strains. However, the isolates formed a new gene cluster that was distinguished from the two distinct K-II subgroups (KM91-like and QX-like). Recombination events were identified in the S1 gene, with their putative parental strains being the KM91-like or QX-like subgroup. In addition, two crossover sites were observed in the S1 gene of IBV isolates. These results suggest that natural genetic recombination between heterologous strains classified into different genetic groups has occurred and may have caused the emergence of new IBV strains. This finding provides important information on IBV evolution and is essential for the effective control of IB in Korea.",

Furthermore, the IBV isolates in this study were obtained prior to the use of nephropathogenic strain of liveattenuated IBV vaccine, and they were almost always isolated from unvaccinated broiler chickens.

Especially, most of the IBV isolates experienced crossover events at nucleotide 861 of the S1 gene (Fig. 3) , indicating that this site may serve as a possible region for template switching in viral RNA synthesis and is a breakpoint candidate for genetic recombination within the S1 gene of Korean nephropathogenic IBV strains.

Unpublished results from an epidemiological investigation have shown that the IBV isolates used in this study were isolated continuously in different regions of Korea from 2005 to 2010, and that outbreaks of these isolates have been increasing annually. These observations support the possibility that IBV recombinant strains have the potential to spread widely and cause epidemics in chickens. In addition, since the S protein of coronavirus is related to host range and cell tropism (Casais et al., 2003; Kuo et al., 2000) , alterations in the pathogenic and antigenic characteristic in IBV isolates could be expected. How recombinant strains from heterologous strains demonstrate tissue tropism or pathogenicity in a host is not clear, but it has been reported that vaccination with commercial vaccines does not ensure complete protection against challenge with recombinant strains (Liu et al., 2006 (Liu et al., , 2009 .

Moreover, the observations support the possibility that these isolates might increase the genetic diversity of IBVs in the field and could hamper disease control in Korea. Therefore, more intensive investigations on biological and antigenic characteristics of the recombinant IBV isolates and detailed assessments of the efficacy of the current vaccines against these isolates are needed.",
