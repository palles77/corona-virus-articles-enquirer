The tobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be so identified and since then over 5000 viruses have been investigated in detail although there are probably millions of viruses in existence and more are being discovered, the latest among these being a cluster of about 1500 viruses in molluscs discovered in late 2016. Among the viruses that are pathogenic to humans one could count influenza, measles, whooping cough, plague, and polio to name a random few. Their numbers are augmented occasionally by new zoonotic viruses that make the jump from animal hosts to infect humans and create new diseases; notable among these was the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that arose from the simian immunodeficiency virus and began infecting humans around the 1980s, and the Zika virus epidemic that is affecting a part of the Americas at this time whose source is believed to be primates in Africa. When new viruses arise against which the human body is not prepared with defense mechanisms, it could lead to widespread epidemics and pandemics; the Spanish flu of 1918 was one such instance which spread rapidly across the world and resulted in over 20 million, also estimated to be 100 million, fatalities; Table 1 provides a glimpse of the more outstanding viral epidemics in the 20th and 21st centuries to show how pathogenic viral diseases can be even with all our understanding to date.",

            "text": "When not in action against any organism, viruses exist as individual particles which are referred to as virions. The virions consist of a protein shell, called a capsid, with the genome of the virus inside; in the case of some viruses, there is also a lipid envelope covering the capsid. Some viruses, called DNA viruses, carry single-stranded or double-stranded DNA genomes; other viruses, called RNA viruses, may carry double-stranded RNA or single-stranded, positive or negative sense RNA genome. The genome itself could be a continuous strand, as in the case of dengue, or could be in separate pieces, one for each constituent gene as in the case of the influenza genome, and referred to as segmented genome. The genes themselves can be grouped as structural and nonstructural. The structural genes contribute to the make up of the capsid, that is the viral coat, which is formed from many identical protein subunits, which may consist of one or more proteins grouped together, and can take up forms such as icosahedral, helical, prolate, and so on. The nonstructural genes function in replication of the genome, among other functions. When a virus attacks a cell, a part of the surface proteins will attach to the cell surface through its segments called receptors and then fuse into the interior of the cell in a process known as endocytosis. Inside the cell the outer layers of the virion are removed by viral or host enzymes and the viral genome is released. The viral genes are then involved in synthesis of viral messenger RNA (mRNA), viral protein synthesis, and replication of the viral genome using the machinery of the host cell to produce multiple copies. During replication there may be errors in copying the nucleotides, resulting in a mutated gene. DNA viruses have the ability to use error correcting enzymes to undo the damage; RNA viruses do not have such machinery and so accumulate errors very rapidly. It is estimated that RNA viruses accumulate errors at the rate of $ 10 \u00c0 4 -10 \u00c0 5 per nucleotide per replication; viruses that are about 10,000 nucleotides long in their genomes such as influenza or dengue viruses will accumulate errors at the rate of about 1 nucleotide per replication. DNA viruses on the other hand will accumulate errors at a rate of $ 10 \u00c0 8 -10 \u00c0 11 and therefore will be much more stable. Accumulation of errors, called genetic drift, may lead to creation of new strains of the virus; other methods of generation of new strains are through reassortments in segmented genomes where whole genes may be exchanged with another homologous strain, or, more rarely, recombination where parts of a gene may be exchanged with similar segments of another homologous strain.",

This immunity can be considered in two partsdinnate immunity and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is provided by our dry outer skin and mucous Guinea declared Ebola free after successful vaccination drive membranes in certain openings like the mouth, nostrils, uterine passages, etc., the body's temperature, the highly acidic environment in the stomach and many others, all of which act to prevent pathogens and microorganisms from harming the host, but are not necessarily specific to any particular pathogen or its varieties. Pathogens and microorganisms that may enter the body through cuts and bruises are ingested by phagocytes, the macrophages and dendritic cells, and finally eliminated. Adaptive immunity is the body's response to specific pathogens, referred to as antigens, that pass the innate immunity barrier through various means. Adaptive immunity is of two typesdhumoral immunity that is rooted in blood serum and other body fluids (known as humors in ancient times) and cell-based immunity. In both cases the immune response is mediated primarily by two cell typesdB-lymphocytes (B-cell) and T-lymphocytes (T-cell), both produced in the bone marrow. The B-cells mature in the bone marrow and on leaving express antigen-binding receptors, called antibodies which are unique to each B-cell, on their membrane; the T-lymphocytes, or T-cells, move from the bone marrow to the thymus to mature, on leaving which each T-cell expresses a unique membrane-bound molecule called T-cell receptor which also binds to antigens under certain conditions. Each of the antibodies or receptors is encoded by specific genes which undergo random rearrangements and create different antibodies. Every B-cell or T-cell has thousands of antibodies or receptors on their surface, each cell having their own unique and identical antibodies; collectively, there would be about 10 10 B-cells and 10 9 T-cells produced in the bone marrow, but these numbers are reduced to some extent by filters to prevent autoimmune threats from the antibodies. These antibodies bind to the antigens with extreme specificity; each antibody can bond with a specific antigen and even a change in one amino acid of the antigen can nullify the bonding. The availability of millions of B-and T-cells with their own antibodies provides diversity and specificity in the antibody-antigen binding against multifarious pathogens.",

The memory B-cells survive much longer than the na\u00efve B-cells; effector B-cells live for a short period but release antibodies at a very high rate, about 2000 per second. On first encounter with an antigen, the immune response can take 5-6 days to start and peak at about 14 days; at the second attack the response occurs very fast, in about 1-2 days, and the intensity is very high.

The T-cells recognize antigens when coupled with special protein molecules known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules which are displayed on the surfaces of cells. The human MHC molecules are expressed by certain HLA (human leukocyte antigen) alleles and contain a cleft at the distal end from the membrane that can contain peptides. There are two main classes of the MHCdMHC Class I which are expressed in almost all vertebrate nucleated cells, and MHC Class II which are expressed in only antigen presenting cells, that is, cells like macrophages, dendrites, etc., that ingest invading antigens by phagocytosis or endocytosis and degrade the complex antigen into small peptides.

The HLA that give rise to the MHCs are highly polymorphic and polygenic; a HLA database lists over 1600 HLA class II molecules alone; the alleles differ between individuals and between populations. Understandably, experimental approaches to determine antigenicity and traditional vaccines where effectiveness of the MHC-peptide bonding has to be tested are prohibitively time-consuming and expensive processes. Computational techniques coupled with robust algorithms to determine the binding affinities of peptides to the MHC molecules become a more reasonable approach. Still, there is a dearth of good data on many alleles that make up a population's HLA profile, and dependence on good models of homology, molecular docking, and structural data remain imperative. Bioinformatics therefore lead the current search for effective vaccine targets.",

Drugs face the same hurdle: drugs such as Relenza developed against influenza have been rendered useless in a few years because of specific mutations in the flu strains, and the current favorite oseltamivir drugs, marketed as Tamiflu, are also reported to be facing resistance in some parts of the United States and Japan due to viral mutations.

This has led to development of the science of \"vaccinomics\" that seeks to utilize our understanding of the body's immune reactions to precisely target those parts of the virus, the antigenic determinants, that will enable the immune response to kill the virus.

In another technique which has gathered a lot of momentum, the initial impetus was provided by graphical representations of DNA sequences in 2D, 3D, and higher dimensions, which then were assessed quantitatively to provide a measure of the degrees of similarity and dissimilarity between sequences; the quantitative measures are computed either by geometrical means or by matrix methods (see Video 1 in the online version at https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801238-3.10878-5 for a brief introduction). In the 2D model, specifically, the geometrical approach is intuitive and simple: For a DNA or RNA sequence of N nucleotides, one starts from the origin of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and proceeds one step in the negative x-direction for an adenine, one step in the positive y-direction for a cytosine, one step in the positive x-direction for a guanine, and one step in the negative y-direction for a thymine (uracil for RNA). Doing this successively for each base in the sequence starting from the beginning traces out a graph in the xy-plain which reflects the base distribution in the sequence. For each base there is a (x, y) coordinate and one can define weighted center of mass",

Use of adjuvants is quite common and well recognized; an adjuvant like AS04 is a part of the Cerverix HPV vaccine.",

            "text": "An added advantage of using peptide vaccines over traditional whole protein vaccines is combining different peptides into one vaccine, called multivalent vaccines, to enable as wide a coverage as possible so that one or the other epitope will elicit adequate immune response. The principle is well-known: Gardasil, a 9-valent VLP vaccine is designed against nine types of human papillomavirus; a childhood vaccine known as triple antigen is designed against diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough where the toxoids of diphtheria and tetanus are used along with whole killed cells of whooping cough. These are examples from currently used traditional vaccines; the potential for multivalent vaccines will increase many fold in the peptide vaccine era.",

The entire exercise of determining T-cell and B-cell epitopes depends acutely on accuracy of genomic and proteomic data and that is by no means guaranteed as yet. For instance, there are still significantly large number of gene and genomic sequences where one or more of the constituents remain ambiguous: for example, out of 22 genomes of the Zika virus, 9 have 1 or more nucleotides, and therefore the associated amino acids, as yet to be identified with certainty. Since antibodies are extremely specific, and one amino acid difference can cancel the antibody-antigen binding, errors in the database can make the entire bioinformatics exercise in vaccine design in vain. Highly reliable data is an imperative in such bioinformatics search for suitable vaccine targets.",

Such epidemics strike fairly rapidly, last over a few months to a year, and then die out either due to mutational changes or enough people acquiring immunity to act as a deterrent to further spread of the virus. Given that a fresh epidemic will arise only from a new virus or a new strain of an old virus, gathering enough genomic data and going through normal dry and wet labs for a fool-proof vaccine within this time schedule is outside the realms of possibility with current traditional or bioinformatics techniques. The approach to the SARS epidemic of 2003 was an exception; the Ebola virus epidemic of 2015 could be controlled by a new vaccine, but that was because the vaccine had already been designed and was ready for field trials, but was brought into live use in the face of exigency. In the case of a future epidemic we will need much better, rapid-result bioinformatics and wet lab techniques to contain such viral attacks. The world is not ready for effective handling of epidemics and pandemics as yet.",
