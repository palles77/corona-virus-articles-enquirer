Upon infecting host cells, coronaviruses assemble a multi-subunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (NSP) responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome. Here, we present the 3.1 \u00c5 resolution structure of the SARS-CoV NSP12 polymerase bound to its essential co-factors, NSP7 and NSP8, using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. NSP12 possesses an architecture common to all viral polymerases as well as a large N-terminal extension containing a kinase-like fold and is unexpectedly bound by two NSP8 co-factors. This structure illuminates the assembly of the coronavirus core RNA-synthesis machinery, provides key insights into NSP12 polymerase catalysis and fidelity and acts as a template for the design of novel antiviral therapeutics.",

Though there are several human coronaviruses responsible for a mild respiratory disease 1 , most notable are the highly pathogenic human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV capable of causing a severe respiratory disease. The zoonotic SARS-CoV emerged into human populations in 2002, spreading to 26 countries during its brief nine month circulation in humans 2 . This epidemic resulted in over 8,000 infections with a ~10% case fatality rate and was eventually contained through public health measures, as there are no specific treatments approved for human coronavirus infections. With the exception of a smaller second SARS-CoV outbreak in 2004 3 , SARS-CoV has been absent from human circulation since the initial outbreak ended. Despite the lack of recent human infections, SARS-CoVlike viruses continue to circulate in bat reservoirs 4 . Similar to SARS-CoV, the zoonotic MERS-CoV also causes a severe respiratory infection in humans and has so far shown limited human-to-human transmission outside of hospital settings 5 . However, ongoing zoonotic transmissions of MERS-CoV have continued since 2012 5 . Outbreaks of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses remain an emerging threat to global health security and given past history are likely to continue to occur.",

All eight of these metal-coordinating amino acids are highly conserved across the coronavirus family ( Supplementary Fig 3) . Both of these metal-binding sites are distal to known active sites, protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Thus, these ions are expected to be structural components of the folded protein rather than directly involved in enzymatic activity. The presence of structural zinc ions in NSP12 is reminiscent of bound zinc atoms in SARS-CoV NSP3, NSP10 and NSP13 and NSP14 11, 14, 17, 18 and points to an extensive utilization of zinc ions for folding proteins of the viral replication complex.",

Sequence analysis of polymerase subunits across the Nidovirales order, which includes coronaviruses, revealed three conserved sequence motifs within this region: AN (SARS-CoV a.a. 69-89), BN (a.a. 112-130), and CN (a.a. 202-222) 10 (Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Further experimentation revealed that the equine arterivirus (EAV) polymerase subunit could be covalently modified with NTPs and that amino acids within the identified conserved motifs were important for this activity, the proposed active site being a lysine residue in AN (SARS-CoV Lys73) 10 . The conserved regions of the polymerase harboring this nucleotidyltransferase activity were termed NiRAN (nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase) 10 .

Structurally, the SARS-CoV NSP12 most closely resembles the polymerases of picornaviruses such as poliovirus, norovirus and rhinovirus 23, 24 . Picornaviruses use a protein primer called VPg to prime RNA synthesis and serve as a 5' cap. However, coronaviruses cap their RNAs with a 5' GTP resembling host RNAs 26 and hence are likely to use a distinct mechanism for RNA initiation. Biochemical evidence has shown that the NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 complex possesses de novo initiation activity that is dependent on the NSP12 polymerase active site 8 similar to viruses of the Flaviviridae family such as Dengue virus and hepatitis C virus which use protein elements within the thumb domain to position a priming nucleotide in the -1 primer position 27 . However, the SARS-CoV NSP12 dsRNA exit tunnel has no obstructions. Hence, the mechanism by which coronavirus polymerases carry out de novo RNA initiation is likely to be distinct from either the picoronavirues or flaviviruses, but the nature of this mechanism remains unclear.",

This density includes NSP7 2-71 and NSP8 84-192 encompassing the NSP8 head domain while the N-terminal region of NSP8 appears to be disordered. The NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer binds to NSP12 on the polymerase thumb domain facing the NTP entry channel. Binding in this position, sandwiches the NSP12 polymerase index finger loop between NSP7-NSP8 and the polymerase thumb domain. The NSP12 index finger loop has been previously identified as necessary for recruitment of NSP12 to replication complexes 34 . The binding of the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer to this loop suggests that NSP7-NSP8 facilitates the interaction of NSP12 with additional components of the RNA synthesis machinery for incorporation into viral replication complexes.",

This second subunit of NSP8 interacts with the NSP12 interface domain proximal to the fingers domain and the RNA template binding channel. The identification of an interaction of NSP8 with the N-terminal region of NSP12 is supported by a recent study of infectious bronchitis virus, a gammacoronavirus, where NSP12 1-400 was sufficient to interact with NSP8 35 . The second subunit of NSP8 a.a. 127-191 resembles the NSP8 head domains of previously determined crystal structures as well as the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer bound to NSP12 discussed above. However, the region of the second subunit of NSP8 a.a. 98-126 appears to adopt a conformation unique from those previously observed and involves a refolding of loops and a helical region to participate in interactions with NSP12 (Fig. 4B) . Comparing both the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer and the second subunit of NSP8 structures as bound to NSP12 with the previously determined SARS-CoV NSP7-NSP8 complex, we find the higher order NSP7-NSP8 oligomer formation inferred from crystal packing to be incompatible with the interfaces observed in the NSP12 bound states. Consequently, amino acids identified as important for NSP8's RNA primase activity 32 would not be brought into close proximity. Hence, formation of this proposed primase active site is inconsistent with the structural data here but is in agreement with previous biochemical studies of the NSP7-NSP8-NSP12 complex 8 .",

Of three NSP7 mutants previously found to diminish polymerase activity, K7A hydrogen bonds to the carbonyls of the NSP7 25-42 helix which interacts with NSP12 and H36A and N37A lie in the NSP7-NSP12 interface. Of the NSP8 residues previously mutated 8 and visible in the structure, four were detrimental to polymerase function. Mutation of NSP8 P183A results in the mutation of a cis-proline residue and may result in an NSP8 folding defect. The three remaining mutated NSP8 positions make important contributions to interactions with NSP12 through the second subunit of NSP8 while these same NSP8 amino acid positions are distal to the observed interaction sites in the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer. NSP8 D99A would disrupt an electrostatic interaction with NSP12 K332. P116 sits in a turn between two NSP8 helices and mutation to an alanine at this position may disrupt the ability of this loop to adopt the unique NSP12-bound conformation. Mutation of NSP8 R190A would disrupt the hydrogen bonding of R190 with carbonyls of NSP8 helix a.a 116-121 which may destabilize the unique conformation of this NSP8 region and prevent NSP12 binding. These previous mutagenesis studies validate the interfaces presented here and emphasize the importance of the observed interactions of NSP12 with NSP7 and NSP8.",

Further 3D sorting and refinement yielded a reconstruction at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution which largely resembles the larger complex ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). However, in addition to missing the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer, this structure also displays a significant amount of disorder in the fingers domain index and ring loops which play a role in template and NTP binding ( Fig  5) . We hypothesize that the binding of the NSP7-NSP8 heterodimer to the index finger loop stabilizes the polymerase domain to permit template recognition. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that while NSP12, NSP7 and NSP8 all individually recognize RNA with no or poor affinity, the complex of NSP12-NSP7-NSP8 is significantly more capable of binding RNA 8 .",

Though kinase activity has not been demonstrated for NSP12, there are several overlapping kinase catalytic residues visible in the SARS-CoV NSP12 NiRAN structure including Asn209 and the nidovirus conserved Asp218 and Phe219. As the NSP12 N-terminus is disordered, we are unable to determine if this region of NSP12 resembles the small kinase domain. However, the shared residue identities with the large kinase domain do suggest a potential nucleotide binding site within the NSP12 NiRAN domain. How such a kinase-like domain carries out the previously reported nucleotidyltransfer 10 remains a subject for further study.",

A 40 nt template RNA corresponding to the 3' end of the SARS-CoV genome was annealed to a 20 nt primer containing a 5' fluorescein label. Primer extension reactions were assembled containing 500 nM NSP12, 1.5 \u00b5M NSP7, 1.5 \u00b5M NSP8, 250 nM annealed primer/template with 10 mM TrisCl pH 8.0, 10 mM potassium chloride, 2 mM magnesium chloride and 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes before the addition of an NTP mix (500 \u00b5M each, final concentration). Reactions were incubated at 30\u02daC for 60 minutes and then analyzed by denaturing TBE-Urea PAGE with fluorescence detection (ChemiDoc MP, BioRad).",
