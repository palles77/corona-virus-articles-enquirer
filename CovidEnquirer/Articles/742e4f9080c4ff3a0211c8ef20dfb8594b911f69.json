            "text": "Great Lakes tributaries are known to deliver waterborne pathogens from a host of sources. To examine the hydrologic, land cover, and seasonal patterns of waterborne pathogens (i.e. protozoa (2), pathogenic bacteria (4) human viruses, (8) and bovine viruses (8)) eight rivers were monitored in the Great Lakes Basin over 29 months from February 2011 to June 2013. Sampling locations represented a wide variety of land cover classes from urban to agriculture to forest. A custom automated pathogen sampler was deployed at eight sampling locations which provided unattended, flow-weighted, large-volume (120 e1630 L) sampling. Human and bovine viruses and pathogenic bacteria were detected by real-time qPCR in 16%, 14%, and 1.4% of 290 samples collected while protozoa were never detected. The most frequently detected pathogens were: bovine polyomavirus (11%), and human adenovirus C, D, F (9%). Human and bovine viruses were present in 16.9% and 14.8% of runoff-event samples (n \u00bc 189) resulting from precipitation and snowmelt, and 13.9% and 12.9% of low-flow samples (n \u00bc 101), respectively, indicating multiple delivery mechanisms could be influential. Data indicated human and bovine virus prevalence was different depending on land cover within the watershed. Occurrence, concentration, and flux of human viruses were greatest in samples from the three sampling locations with greater than 25% urban influence than those with less than 25% urban influence. Similarly, occurrence, concentration, and flux of bovine viruses were greatest in samples from the two sampling locations with greater than 50 cattle/km 2 than those with less than 50 cattle/km 2 . In seasonal analysis, human and bovine viruses occurred more frequently in spring and winter seasons than during the fall and summer. Concentration, occurrence, and flux in the context of hydrologic condition, seasonality, and land use must be considered for each watershed individually to develop effective watershed management strategies for pathogen reduction.",

For example, human virus occurrence during low-flow periods suggests a continuous source of sewage contamination to the watershed such as wastewater treatment effluent, exfiltration from failing wastewater infrastructure, or illicit connections of sanitary sewers and/or septic systems (Rutsch et al., 2006) . In addition to the continuous sources of human viruses described above, sources during runoff periods include periods of high-flow stress on the sanitary sewage system due to increased flow volumes. These high-flow-induced sources can include sanitary sewer overflows, combined sewer overflows, and leaks in sewage conveyance infrastructure. Bovine virus occurrence during low-flow periods suggests direct cattle access to streams as a continuous source, while overland flow from barnyards, pastures, and manure application, in addition to subsurface drain tiles would be high-flow-induced sources. Watershed transport mechanisms will influence the fate of the aforementioned sources and can determine the resulting survival, occurrence, and magnitude of waterborne pathogens present in surface waters (Ferguson et al., 2003) .",

A study in Michigan sampled nine rivers for enterovirus and rotavirus, providing insight into spatial variability (Jenkins et al., 2005) .

Stream-water volume was computed by integrating instantaneous discharge values over the period of interest. For low-flow periods, the period of interest was the sampling period. For runoff-event periods, the period of interest began at the initial hydrograph rise, and ended when flow returned to base-flow conditions or when a subsequent runoff-event hydrograph began. When runoff-event periods included more than one sample, a summation of loadings (streamflow volume X concentration) from the individual samples were used to compute the virus flux.

Considering the relatively large number of human viruses analyzed compared to previous studies, the selection of organisms is not likely to be a reason for the low occurrence of human viruses observed in the current study. Numerous other factors could influence virus prevalence in a watershed and may contribute to differences from previous study results including: the prevalence of viruses in the human population during the study period, virus sources, land cover characteristics, hydrologic condition, season, and differences in sampling and analytical procedures. Given human viruses were present in all eight watersheds monitored, and each had a wide variation in proportion of areas served by municipal and septic systems, it appears all of the aforementioned factors may potentially contribute to the pathogen contamination detected in these samples.",

            "text": "The prevalence of human viruses during different hydrologic periods did not indicate differences at individual sampling locations during runoff-event periods as compared to low-flow periods whether considering concentration, occurrence, or flux. On the surface, three sampling locations (River Rouge, Milwaukee River and River Raisin) look to have greater prevalence of human viruses during runoff-event periods than during low-flow periods, and four locations (Clinton, Portage, Manitowoc and Maumee Rivers) look to have greater human virus prevalence during low-flow periods, but none of these results are statistically significant. The relatively small number of samples coupled with the low level of occurrence presents a challenge in determining statistically significant results at individual sampling locations. In further consideration of hydrologic influence, there may be watershed-specific factors that influence virus presence under different hydrologic conditions such as prevalence of viruses in the human population during the time of study (Bosch, 1998) , age and condition of potential sources including septic and municipal systems (Sercu et al., 2011) , precipitation characteristics (Corsi et al., 2014) , snowpack, and the influence of moisture conditions in the soils adjacent to sources over different seasons (John and Rose, 2005) . Even with the substantial restoration efforts which have resulted in a reduction of the number of CSOs in the River Rouge watershed in recent decades (Rouge River National Wet Weather Demonstration Project, 2014) , data from the current study indicates human sewage contamination still exists during runoff-event periods in the River Rouge. This is consistent with the nature of CSO events and the potential for other infrastructure issues which lead to exfiltration of sewage during increased runoff periods (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2004) . Conversely, misconnected and failing septic and sanitary systems, upstream wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge, and CSOs have all been identified as sources of human waste to the Clinton River watershed (Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, 2011 . The Clinton River has the highest percentage of wastewater effluent relative to total streamflow discharge of the eight sampling locations monitored (Table 1) . Wastewater treatment often does not fully remove human viruses (Fong et al., 2010; Myrmel et al., 2006) , so this can be a source of potential human virus contamination that is diluted during runoff-events, consistent with Clinton River results from the current study. An explanation for increased human virus prevalence during runoff-event periods in the River Raisin is less obvious given the rural nature of the watershed, although biosolid application of septic and municipal waste effluent may be one potential contributor (Sidhu and Toze, 2009) . Land cover in the River Raisin is dominated by agriculture (67%), and sewage is largely treated by septic systems and small locality treatment systems.",

This result could potentially be explained by four mechanisms: 1) viruses survive longer in cooler winter temperatures (Schijven and Hassanizadeh, 2000) , 2) microorganism-damaging ultraviolet radiation penetrates the water less during winter due to reduced photoperiods and the presence of ice cover, and during spring due to greater turbidities from increased flows, 3) the watersheds had greater flow levels during spring than other parts of the year (Table S8) , increasing stress on the wastewater conveyance infrastructure and the resulting risk of sewage exfiltration, and 4) organism (adenovirus, norovirus, rotavirus, etc.) activity and infections within human populations tend to rise and/or peak during the winter and spring seasons (Dey et al., 2013; Rohayem, 2009; Tran et al., 2010) . In addition to the four mechanisms above, municipal WWTPs and/ or wastewater stabilization lagoons in all studied watersheds have state regulations and/or National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits that ease the disinfection requirement for WWTP effluent during the non-recreational period of October/ NovembereApril (Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (2006); Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, 2016; Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (1986)). Results from the current study are consistent with previous research concluding human viruses in rivers were most prevalent during the cold-weather months spanning late fall through spring.

The Clinton River does have some agricultural land cover that could account for this, but the River Rouge consists primarily of urban land cover. It is possible that the bovine rotavirus A detected in urban watersheds originates from the human-bovine reassortant vaccine amplified by bovine rotavirus A primers (Matthijnssens et al., 2010) . The vaccine is administered orally and may be present in WWTP effluent and leaking sanitary/septic systems. In an analysis of virus presence as compared to humanspecific and ruminant-specific bacteria, bovine rotavirus A does not increase with human-specific bacteria, but does increase with ruminant-specific bacteria. These findings suggest the humanbovine reassortant vaccine is not a substantial contributor to bovine rotavirus A detected in this study.",

In addition, the importance of land use (high compared to low cattle density) with respect to bovine virus prevalence is apparent in each of the different methods of evaluation presented in the present study. The presence of bovine viruses during runoff-event periods and low-flow periods indicates the possibility of different delivery mechanisms from the source to the stream that become influential during the different hydrologic conditions. Presence of bovine viruses during runoffevent periods is likely a result of overland runoff in barnyard and pasture settings as well as runoff from crop land after manure spreading operations. Potential sources of bovine viruses during low-flow periods include instances where cattle have direct access or are located adjacent to the stream, and situations where applied land manure from cattle manure spreading operations can flow to the stream through tile drainage or the shallow groundwater system. These sources and transport mechanisms are consistent with those identified in previous research on livestock-related waterborne pathogens (Crane et al., 1983; Givens et al., 2016; Jamieson et al., 2002; Wilkes et al., 2014) .",

This result is likely influenced by several factors including: prevalence of viruses in the bovine herd population, greater virus survival in cooler winter temperatures, ice cover, shorter photoperiod, winter manure spreading, and increased soil-moisture content, which enhances the efficiency of hydrologic pathways from sources to receiving streams (Bosch et al., 2006; Mawdsley et al., 1995; Stuntebeck et al., 2011; Xagoraraki et al., 2014) .

The flow-compositing technique described herein allowed for determination of mean pathogen concentrations throughout entire runoff-event periods or over extended low-flow periods that included the full light cycle. This type of characterization provided a way to minimize uncertainty in determination of concentrations and flux computations that arise from less intensive sampling techniques (e.g. grab sampling). Using these data, and normalizing by drainage area, provided an equal measure for comparison among watersheds to allow stakeholders proper data to make informed management decisions on the most effective ways to reduce pathogen delivery to receiving water bodies.",

Sampling locations with greater than 25% urban land cover and cattle densities exceeding 50 cattle/km 2 had the highest human and bovine virus occurrence, concentration, and flux, respectively, suggesting virus prevalence was dependent on land cover within the watershed. Human and bovine virus prevalence across all eight sampling locations exhibited similar seasonal response during low-flow and runoff-event periods with elevated prevalence during winter and spring as compared to summer and fall, emphasizing the potential influence of colder water temperature, sunlight exposure and watershed conditions on virus survival. Hydrologic condition, whether runoff-events or low-flow periods, did not explain variability observed in human and bovine virus occurrence, concentration, or flux which suggests contrasting delivery mechanisms from the source to the stream become influential during the different hydrologic conditions. Waterborne pathogen prevalence observed across the eight Great Lakes watersheds appears to be influenced by virus sources, hydrology, land cover, and seasonal characteristics, but the exact influence varied by sampling location, presumably due to the source-specific differences among watersheds. Concentration, occurrence, and flux in the context of hydrologic condition, seasonality, and land use must be considered for each watershed individually to develop effective watershed management strategies for pathogen reduction.",
