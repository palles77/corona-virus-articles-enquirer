Besides this multi-component reactions are emerging as a powerful tool in the synthesis of biologically important compounds. 2 FriedeleCrafts reaction 3 is one of the oldest carbonecarbon bond forming processes, and is still an attractive method to introduce substituents on aromatic rings. Initial works concerned FriedeleCrafts acylation from acyl chlorides or alkylation from alkyl halides. To perform acylations, Lewis acids are needed. More than stoichiometric amounts of AlCl 3 or BF 3 are required, whereas catalytic amounts of rare-earth triflates, 4 more specially scandium triflate, 5 perfluorinated rare-earth metals, 6 gallium triflate 7 or bismuth triflate, 8 allow the formation of the expected products.",

As can be seen from Table 1 , when the amount of the LiClO 4 increased from 5 to 10, and 15 mol %, the yields increased from 80 to 95 and 96%, respectively. It was found that 10 mol % LiClO 4 in EtOH is sufficient to push this reaction forward (Table 1 , entry 2). More amounts of the LiClO 4 (15 mol %) did not improve the yields and decreasing the amount of LiClO 4 (5 mol %) resulted in a decrease in the yield of 4a and increase in the yield of 5.
