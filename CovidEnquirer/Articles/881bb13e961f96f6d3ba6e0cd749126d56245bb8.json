Allantoic fluid from the injected eggs agglutinated 0.5% (vol/vol) chicken erythrocytes, indicating the presence of replication-competent virus in the nasal swab sample. When evaluated by electron microscopy, allantoic fluid supernatant from the infected egg displayed enveloped influenza virus-like particles of 100-120 nm ( Figure 1 ). We sequenced the entire genome of the virus by using RNA harvested from the allantoic fluid of infected eggs. Sequence analysis was performed as described by WHO by using methods for pH1N1 virus (9) . A BLAST search (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was used to identify sequences similar to those of the giant panda isolate; these sequences were GenBank accession nos. KF277197-KF277204. Analyses showed that each of the 8 gene segments of the virus we isolated were closely related to pH1N1 viruses circulating among humans, including a human representative strain (A/California/04/2009) and a contemporary strain (A/Sichuan/1/2009); these viruses showed 98.6%-100% nt identity to the panda strain (online Technical Appendix Table 1 , wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/ article/20/3/13-1531-Techapp1.pdf). Phylogenetic analysis of the 8 gene segments of the virus we isolated showed that the isolate was related to the pH1N1 virus clade of influenza viruses (Figure 2 ; online Technical Appendix Figure) . The results of the BLAST and phylogenetic analyses suggest that a human pH1N1 virus was transmitted directly to giant pandas without recombination or significant adaptation. We named the virus that we isolated A/giant panda/01/ Ya'an/2009 (H1N1).",

We documented infection with this virus in giant pandas in China during 2009. Sequence analysis of a virus isolated from a nasal swab sample revealed that it was nearly identical to the pH1N1 virus circulating in humans, which suggests that the virus may have been transmitted to the pandas directly from humans. Furthermore, serologic analysis of samples from the affected pandas was consistent with productive infection by pH1N1 virus. Seroconversion was documented in each animal, although 1 animal appeared to have been previously exposed to pH1N1 or a related virus that was able to elicit cross-reactive antibodies. Similarly, some pandas had detectable HI antibodies against H3 and H6 subtype influenza viruses, raising the possibility that giant pandas may be infected with human-and avian-origin influenza viruses.",

Our findings highlight the risk posed by influenza viruses to these animals, extend the known host range of influenza A viruses, and have implications for wildlife conservation and influenza virus epidemiology. When taken together with previous reports of pH1N1 infection of other mammals, our data suggest that this virus can efficiently infect a wider range of mammalian species than can other influenza viruses. Increased surveillance and control of influenza viruses in giant panda populations are imperative for successful conservation of these endangered animals.
