Similarly, hospital expenditure related to such illnesses (calculated in terms of cost per hospital bed) amounts to about \u00a3l billion per year. The term 'respiratory disease' covers many different illnesses and it is always a good idea to provide estimates for specific illnesses as well as respiratory disease in general. Influenza accounts for 25-75 per cent of the GP services mentioned above. These figures are based on inter-epidemic years and when there is an epidemic the hospitalization rates for adults with high risk medical conditions increase fivefold. All of these figures are approximations, but they show we are dealing with illnesses which have a large impact on the health services.",

For example, in the Hong Kong epidemic of 1968 it was estimated that over 26 million working days were lost due to incapacity from influenza. Even in inter-epidemic years this figure can be as high as 7-10 million days. In economic terms it has been estimated that in the 1974-5 influenza outbreaks over \u00a3100 million was lost in productivity and in the amount paid out in sickness benefits. The impact of influenza can be highlighted by comparing it with other disorders. For example, influenza accounts for 10-12 per cent of all absences from work, which is about the same as those due to musculo-skeletal disorders and twice the number due to psychiatric disorders.",

It is often assumed that when an individual has influenza he or she will retire to bed and the question of impaired efficiency will not arise. However, prior to the onset of the illness, performance efficiency may be reduced and other reports suggest that impaired performance may extend into the period after the symptoms have gone. Grant (1972) states that the evidence for influenzal encephalopathy (drowsiness, confusion and epileptiform events) is well established. He also argues that post-influenzal effects may occur and that these can influence the judgements of highly skilled professional staff. Grant cites eleven case histories to support this view and the general features of these can be illustrated by considering the following case.",

Indeed, many individuals would claim that the effects of the common cold are too slight or transitory to be of any practical importance, and people are often chided by colleagues for staying off work with a cold. However, many influenza-like illnesses are produced by viruses similar to those which lead to the common cold. Indeed, the term influenza often refers to the systemic effects (fever, myalgia and malaise) which may \u0391\u03a1.

In contrast to this, colds and influenza are widespread and it is of great importance to know more about their effects on performance. There are few studies of this topic and the reasons for this will be discussed in the next section. In one of the few reports of a controlled experiment on naturally occurring colds, Heazlett and Whaley (1976) tested 120 thirteen-year-olds when they were well. Thirty pupils subsequently developed colds and they were retested during their illness. Thirty healthy controls were then randomly selected and retested. The children carried out three tasks and the results showed that reading comprehension was unimpaired whereas auditory and visual perception were worse when the children had colds. The tasks used in this experiment were crude (auditory perception was measured by four sets of nonsense syllables being pronounced to the subject and the subject repeating them; and visual perception was measured by the subject repeating the sequential lighting pattern of four numbered bulbs in a box). Yet even these tasks were able to pick up some form of decrement in the group of subjects who reported having a cold. Such results clearly require replication and yet there has been little attempt to carry out further research in this area. Reasons for this, and difficulties encountered in this type of study, are discussed in the next section.",

Another reason that there has been little research in this area is that it is difficult to study naturally-occurring illnesses. These illnesses are hard to predict and it is unclear whether a virus produced the symptoms, and if so which virus was the infecting agent (there are over two hundred viruses that produce colds). The study of naturally occurring illnesses only enables one to examine the effects of clinical illnesses, and it is often difficult to obtain objective measures of the symptoms. It is also possible that subclinical infections may influence behaviour and these can only be identified using the appropriate virological techniques. Such problems have been overcome by examining the effects of experimentally induced colds and influenza at the MRC Common Cold Unit, Salisbury. Before describing the routine of this Unit it is necessary to discuss briefly the causes of colds and influenza in more detail.",

Subsequently, over two hundred viruses producing upper respiratory tract infections have been identified. The majority of colds are thought to be caused by rhinoviruses (over one hundred different types have now been identified) or coronaviruses. However, about one-third of colds are produced by other viruses, such as parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, which cause severe illnesses in children but produce symptoms in adults which are indistinguishable from the common cold. While the agents which produce infection are well documented, it is still unclear exactly how they are transmitted and what lies between infection and the appearance of symptoms. (Chakraverty et al, 1986) and new subtypes are constantly appearing. Certain base changes in its DNA sequence alter the viral-specific proteins that are recognized by. the host immune system, thus changing the viruses' antigenic properties. This means that previously immune populations are once again vulnerable, which gives rise to epidemics. Epidemics occur at infrequent intervals, usually after an absence of several years. However, virological surveillance of the UK by the Public Health Laboratory has shown that over the past thirty years strains of influenza A and \u0392 circulate widely each winter (Chakraverty et al, 1986 ).",

This first method of assessing performance was used only in a small number of trials, largely because it was unpopular with the volunteers and because it interfered with the routine of the Unit.",

Subjects were always tested at the same time of day on all occasions (although some subjects were tested in the morning and others in the afternoon, which meant that a between-subjects comparison allowed diurnal variation of any effects to be measured). The computerized tasks were selected to assess a range of functions (memory, attention, motor skills) and most of the tests have been widely used to study abnormal states or stressful environments. In most trials the volunteers could be subdivided into those with colds, those with subclinical infections and those who remained uninfected (or were given placebos). In some trials, however, there were no volunteers in certain categories. Analyses of covariance were carried out on the data using the pre-challenge scores as covariates.

It is unclear which mechanisms underlie these effects. There is considerable evidence that certain types of virus (e.g. enteroviruses) have a strong affinity for muscle and may produce muscle damage. Recent evidence (Mier-Jedrzejowicz et al, 1988) confirms that upper respiratory tract infections can influence muscle function and this provides a plausible explanation for some of the effects on performance. Another possibility is that some other cytokine (e.g. interleukin 2) is involved. Indeed, it is well known that these mediators have an effect on the muscles which could account for the impaired hand-eye co-ordination. Alternatively, the impairments could be due to changes in sensory stimulation via the trigeminal nerves in the nose. Lastly, they could represent a 'distraction effect', produced by sneezing or other nasal irritations. The main difficulty for all these possible explanations is in accounting for why the effects are selective (observed in some tasks but not others). These selective effects were examined in further detail by considering the effects of colds on a range of memory tasks and also different aspects of vision.

This effect was not replicated when volunteers were challenged with either a Coronavirus or rhinovirus. However, contrast sensitivity improved in volunteers with a subclinical Coronavirus infection. These studies were also important in that they showed that pre-challenge measures can be used to indicate susceptibility to infection and illness. These effects are reviewed in the following section. There has been considerable interest in investigating whether psychological factors are important in determining susceptibility to infection and illness. Studies carried out at the Common Cold Unit (e.g. Totman et al, 1980; Broadbent et al, 1984; Cohen et al, 1991) have shown that factors such as personality and stress influence vulnerability to infection. Smith et al (1990b) showed that performance measures taken prior to virus challenge may also be related to the likelihood of developing a cold. In other words, volunteers who get a cold may be worse than those who remain uninfected even before they are given the virus. Smith et al (in press) found that volunteers who developed colds following respiratory syncytial virus challenge were more sensitive to a visually disturbing pattern prior to challenge than individuals who remained symptom-free.

It was possible to determine not only the clinical efficacy of the drugs but to examine whether they removed the performance impairments associated with a cold. One study demonstrated that sodium nedocromil (a drug thought to suppress mediators such as histamine) reduced cold symptoms and the extent of the cold-induced performance decrement (Barrow et al, 1990) . Similarly, Smith et al (1991b) showed that sucking zinc gluconate lozenges can eliminate the slower reaction times associated with having a cold. Unfortunately, the mode of action of these drugs is unclear, and they provide little information about the mechanisms underlying the effects of colds on performance.",

The effects were selective in that they depended on the nature of the activity being carried out and the type of virus. The impairments were not restricted to times when the person was symptomatic but also occurred before and after the illness. Subclinical infections also reduced performance, although again the effect was selective. The research also showed that performance measures taken before virus challenge were related to susceptibility of developing a cold. Unfortunately, we have little knowledge of the mechanisms underlying these effects, although it does appear that peptide mediators may be involved. It must now be asked what implications these studies have for safety and efficiency.",

Indeed, the results show that such a study is now warranted, although one should bear in mind that it would be a mistake to assume that analogous effects will necessarily be observed with real-life illnesses and tasks. Naturally occurring illnesses are typically more severe than those examined at the Common Cold Unit and one could argue that they should produce far greater effects. However, many real-life tasks are well practised and one could suggest that this will make them less susceptible to the effects of these illnesses. One should also note that many other factors influence performance efficiency and it would be wrong to continue to study the effects of these illnesses in isolation. Indeed, it is possible that viral illnesses not only have direct effects on performance but may indirectly influence it by making the person more susceptible to other factors.",

The selective effects of different viruses means that one must use virological techniques to attempt to discover which virus was responsible for the illness. This is difficult to do at the moment and only about 30 per cent of samples yield a positive viral identification, which means large numbers of subjects must be tested to obtain enough subjects in each virus condition. Ideally, one also wants to carry out prospective studies with pre-illness baselines for subjects. This technique is much more sensitive than cross-sectional methodologies. One also wants to use tasks which are not susceptible to the effects of compensatory effort, which can reduce the apparent effect of other low arousal states such as sleep-deprivation. In other words, research on the functional significance of upper respiratory illnesses will have both problems which are specific to the topic and those which are common to the study of other possible influences on performance. Nevertheless, the anecdotal case histories and",
