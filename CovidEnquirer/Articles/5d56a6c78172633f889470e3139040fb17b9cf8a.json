These cells resemble the typical morphology of embryonic stem cells, express pluripotency markers, and are able to transmit through germlines. To date, iPSCs of many species have been generated, whereas generation of bat iPSCs (biPSCs) has not been reported. To facilitate in-depth study of bats at the molecular and cellular levels, we describe the successful derivation of biPSCs with a piggyBac (PB) vector that contains eight reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Nanog, cMyc, Lin28, Nr5a2, and miR302/367. These biPSCs were cultured in media containing leukemia inhibitory factor and three small molecule inhibitors (CHIR99021, PD0325901, and A8301). They retained normal karyotype, displayed alkaline phosphatase activity, and expressed pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, TBX3, and TRA-1-60. They could differentiate in vitro to form embryoid bodies and in vivo to form teratomas that contained tissue cells of all three germ layers. Generation of biPSCs will facilitate future studies on the mechanisms of antiviral immunity and longevity of bats at the cellular level.",

            "text": "As an ancient mammal, bats are the second largest group of mammals and live all over the world. Compared with other mammalian species of similar body size, the lifespan of bats is much longer [33, 34] . It is thought that hibernation, high body metabolic rates, low radical generation, and low reproductive rates are the causes of the longevity of bats [33, 35] . DNA mismatch repair systems, microsatellite instability, and antioxidant activity may be associated with bat longevity at the molecular level [36] . Sequencing analysis of the bat Myotis brandtii genome and transcriptome discovered that altered growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis may have effect on longevity [37] .",

As an important nuclear receptor, Nr5a2 can replace exogenous Oct4 and work in combination with Sox2 and Klf4 to maintain the pluripotency of iPSCs [43] . To reprogram BEFs, we constructed eight reprogramming factors in pSTEM-h103, because of the use of all these factors in pSTEM-h103, the efficiency of biPSC generation has improved significantly. Transfection methods also affect iPSC generation and cell quality. Previously, retroviral and lentiviral vectors were widely used to deliver reprogramming factors. However, they tend to randomly and stably integrate into the chromosomes that could be risky of tumorigenesis [44] . Later, recombinant adenoviral [45] and Sendai viral delivery vectors [46] were used to reduce the integration rates into the genomes and yet the efficiency of iPSC generation was very low [47] . Protein transduction method was also attempted to generate iPSCs [48] . However, it is costly, timeconsuming, and low in efficiency, preventing its wide applications. PB system has many advantages over the viral systems, such as high safety, convenient operation, easy integration into the genomes, and high expression efficiency of exogenous genes [49, 50] . Most importantly, the inserted PB fragments could be excised without leaving a footprint.",

In this experiment, Oct4 and Sox2 expression was upregulated greatly compared with BEFs, showing that the biPSC lines stably maintained an ESC status. The decreased expression of Klf4 and cMyc explained that they were not essential for the maintenance of the ESC status of the biPSCs. Klf4 only plays a role in the early stage of the cellular reprogramming [56] , and cMyc as an oncogene is not essential for the generation and maintenance of the iPSCs [57] . High-level expression of cMyc has negative effect on the pluripotency of iPSCs [58] . Low-level expression of cMyc suggested that the biPSCs were impossible to be cancerous cells. Both immunostaining and western blot analyses demonstrated that pluripotency factors could be expressed at the protein level in biPSCs, which further confirmed the pluripotent status of biPSCs. Our biPSCs could be used as cells for antiviral or other stress-related study purposes. Various types of tissue cells generated from biPSCs could be used for further exploring the mechanisms of bat's antiviral immunity and longevity that would greatly benefit the mankind.",

In this research, cell culture medium components have been improved and optimized from a variety of aspects to fit for the growth and proliferation of biPSCs. Encouraged by Hou's [59] success in using small molecules to reprogram mouse fibroblasts, large-scale screening of small molecule compounds is being carried out to further improve the quality of biPSCs.",
