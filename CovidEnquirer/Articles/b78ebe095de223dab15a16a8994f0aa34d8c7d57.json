Animal studies suggest daptomycin may be useful for the treatment of endocarditis. Daptomycin is not indicated for pneunionia, with poorer outcomes than conventional treatnient. It is available as an IV niedication and exhibits 92% plasnia protein binding in vitro. In healthy adult humans, daptoniycin has a volume of distribution of 0.1 Ukg and a plasma elimination half-life of -9 hours, and is eliminated primarily by renal excretion (-54%). In patients with reduced renal function, including those receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, the dose interval should be 48 hours.

After chemical and enzymatic modification of A21978C, daptomycin (ie, LY146032) demonstrated the best combination of in vitro antimicrobial activity against selected gram-positive cocci and the least acute toxicity in mice (median lethal dose, 600 mg/kg IV) among structural derivatives synthesized. 25 The chemical name for this compound is N-decanoyl-L-tryptophyl-Lasparaginyl-L-aspartyl-L-threonylglycyl-L-omithyl-Laspartyl-D-alanyl-L-aspartylglycyl-D-seryl-threo-3methyl-L-glutamyl-3-anthraniloyl-L-alanine 1-1act\u00b0he Daptomycin has an empiric formula of Cr2HlolNlrO 2 and a molecular weight of 1620.67 kDa. >",

Daptornycin 75 rng/kg QD yielded a 3.3-fold higher mean (SD) Cm~ x than the same total daily dose administered TIT)(5+0 [112] tlg/mL vs 238 [22] tlg/mL). In comparison, 25 mg/kg QD yielded a mean (SD) C>~x of 165 (44) With microscopy, minimal degeneration and regeneration of myofibers was observed with no evidence of necrosis, cell lysis, or fibrosis. No statistically significant difference in incidence of myofiber lesions was found between 75 mg/kg as a single daily dose or in 3 divided doses.lB Instead, minimal, nonsuppuratire inflammation secondary to skeletal muscle degeneration was seen. Based on the animal studies showing a higher risk of skeletal muscle toxicity with same total daily dose divided into smaller fractions than administered as a single daily dose despite no greater Cm~ x, the investigators hypothesized that increased duration between doses of daptomycin may allow for repair of effects on skeletal muscle.:23 No progression of toxicity was detected with QD administration after 6 months. Lack of fibrosis (cell lysis) even after 20 days of treatment suggested daptomycin caused leakage of CPK from myofibers secondary to membrane perturbation. Daptomycin-induced myopathy appeared to be specific to skeletal muscle and also appeared to be nonprogressive and readily reversible in nature. Results from safety analyses in dogs have been extrapolated to humans, suggesting that daptomycin should be administered in a QD regimen to reduce the potential for skeletal muscle toxicity.123",

Muscle effects were reversible after discontinuation of daptomycin. Three other subjects in clinical pharmacology studies also discontinued participation due to drug-related, asymptomatic elevation of CPK. Maximum values were 1940 or 1593 U/L after 14 or Y days of daptomycin 6 mg/kg QD, respectively, and 4498 U/L after 5 doses of daptomycin (loading dose 4 mg/kg, followed by 3 mg/kg QD).

In Phase II studies, 4 patients also discontinued daptomycin after increases in CPK occurred. Seven patients in Phase III studies for the treatment of CAP also showed AEs affecting the musculoskeletal or connective tissue systems. However, in a later pharmacokinetic study using daptomycin 8 mg/kg every 24 hours, transient increases in CPK to <2.5 times the upper limit of normal were observed in 2 participants for only 2 days and were not associated with muscle symptoms. One of these subjects continued to receive 8 mg/kg QD for 14 days without further increases in CPK. 4~ A preliminary evaluation of the incidence of skeletal muscle effects associated with daptomycin treatment (4 mg/kg QD for 7-14 days) among patients in the Phase III trials described by Arbeit et al M3 was presented in poster form by Knapp et al.12+ AEs and elevation in serum CPK were monitored throughout the study. Baseline levels of CPK >500 U/L were seen in 14.4% of patients (77/534) treated with daptomycin and 16.5% of patients (92/558) treated with semisynthetic penicillins or vancomycin (ie, comparatot group). Approximately 70% of these elevations resolved with antimicrobial treatment, suggesting that the elevations were associated with infection. Transient elevations in CPK occurred in 3.4% (18/354) of daptomycin-treated and 3.6\u00b0/0 (20/558) of comparatortreated patients, particularly in association with adjunctive surgery or intramuscular injection, and these resolved even with continued antimicrobial treatment. Signs and symptoms of skeletal muscle damage (eg, myalgia, weakness) were observed in 6.4% (34/534) and 5.0% (28/558), respectively However, skeletal muscle effects were not associated with elevations in CPK and resolved with continued treatment. Only 1 patient (0.2%) in the daptomycin group appeared to show a rise in CPK accompanied by muscle pain and weakness that may be associated with the drug. After 10 days of daptomycin, CPK concentration peaked at 10,320 U/L. After discontinuation of the drug, CPK and muscle symptoms resolved. Thus, skeletal muscle toxicity did not appear to be a common side effect among patients receiving daptomycin 4 mg/kg QD for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections.",

In comparison, the cost of treatment with a 10-day course of quinupristindalfopristin is $2557 (7.5 mg/kg BID [500-mg vials \u00d7 20]). Because of its relatively long half-life (-9 hours), daptomycin is administered QD, which is more convenient for the patient and health care workers. To date, no pharmacoeconomic analyses of daptomycin have been published. With its high acquisition cost, daptomycin should be reserved for infections due to vancornycin-resistant pathogens or infections caused by gram-positive pathogens that failed to respond to vancomycin therapy.",

            "text": "Daptomycin is the first member of a new class of antirnicrobial agents known as the cyclic lipopeptides. It causes rapid cell death by disrupting multipie functional aspects of the bacterial plasma membrane, a pharmacologic target that is unique among currently available antimicrobial agents. 27 Because of this unique mechanism of action, cross-resistance with other antibacterial classes is unlikely and has not been reported. The incidence of spontaneous resistance to daptomycin is rare. 93 Of the >1000 subjects who received daptomycin in Phase II/III clinical tri-als, only 2 confirmed cases of emergence of resistance to daptomycin were reported, e6 In vitro, daptomycin exhibits rapid bactericidal activity against a wide range of clinically important gram-positive pathogens including resistant strains such as ORSA, VISA, VRSA, penicillin-resistant 5 pneumoniae, and VREE 7\u00b0~3'75 '76 The bactericidal activity of daptomycin appears to be independent of the metabolic status of bacteria (ie, it is active against both dividing and stationary bacteria), 12r making it an attractive choice for the treatment of sequestered high inoculum infections such as endocarditis. Efficacy data from 2 pivotal trials involving a total of 1118 subjects have shown that daptomycin is as efficacious as vancomycin or a semisynthetic penicillin (ie, nakillin, oxacillin, dicloxacillin, or flucloxacillin) in the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (daptomycin vs comparator drug: 62.5% vs 60.9% for study DAP-SST-9801 and 80.4% vs 80.5% for study DAP-SST-9901). 12\u00b0 Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of daptomycin at a dosage of 6 mg/kg QD for staphylococcal bacteremia and endocarditis are ongoing.",

In early clinical trials, 2 of the 5 subjects who received daptomycin at a dosage of 4 mg/kg IV BID developed myopathy after 7 and 11 days, respectively, of dosing. This daptomycin-induced myopathy was mild, nonprogressive, skeletal muscle specific, and readily reversible. 123 In an animal model, Oleson et al ~23 reported that daptomycin-related musculoskeletal effects could be minimized with QD administration by allowing for more time between doses for repair of subclinical damages. Whether this daptomycininduced myopathy in humans could truly be curtailed by QD administration remains unknown. Complicated skin and soft tissue infections are typically treated for 7 to 14 days. Further studies are needed to delineate the long-term AEs on the human musculoskeletal system. It would be prudent to monitor patients for muscle pain or weakness and to obtain CPK levels weekly while undergoing daptomycin therapy Medications with similar musclerelated AEs, such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, should also be temporarily discontinued if clinically possible.",
