            "text": "Over 10 years have passed since the deadly human coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) emerged from the Guangdong Province of China. Despite the fact that the SARS-CoV pandemic infected over 8500 individuals, claimed over 800 lives and cost billions of dollars in economic loss worldwide, there still are no clinically approved antiviral drugs, vaccines or monoclonal antibody therapies to treat SARS-CoV infections. The recent emergence of the deadly human coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a sobering reminder that new and deadly coronaviruses can emerge at any time with the potential to become pandemics. Therefore, the continued development of therapeutic and prophylactic countermeasures to potentially deadly coronaviruses is warranted. The coronaviral proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), are attractive antiviral drug targets because they are essential for coronaviral replication. Although the primary function of PLpro and 3CLpro are to process the viral polyprotein in a coordinated manner, PLpro has the additional function of stripping ubiquitin and ISG15 from host-cell proteins to aid coronaviruses in their evasion of the host innate immune responses. Therefore, targeting PLpro with antiviral drugs may have an advantage in not only inhibiting viral replication but also inhibiting the dysregulation of signaling cascades in infected cells that may lead to cell death in surrounding, uninfected cells. This review provides an up-to-date discussion on the SARS-CoV papain-like protease including a brief overview of the SARS-CoV genome and replication followed by a more in-depth discussion on the structure and catalytic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLpro, the multiple cellular functions of SARS-CoV PLpro, the inhibition of SARS-CoV PLpro by small molecule inhibitors, and the prospect of inhibiting papain-like protease from other coronaviruses. This paper forms part of a series of invited articles in Antiviral Research on ''From SARS to MERS: 10 years of research on highly pathogenic human coronaviruses.'' \u00d3",

Before the zoonotic emergence of the first human coronavirus that caused the 2002/2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), there was a paucity of information pertaining to CoV genomes and mechanisms of replication. Since then, the numbers of CoVs sequenced and studied have increased dramatically and several potential drug targets have emerged. Many of the SARS-CoV drug targets are encoded in the 5 0 -terminal two thirds of the genome, within the two open reading frames (ORF) that encode for the replicase or non-structural proteins (nsps) (see Fig. 1 ) (Tong, 2009) .",

            "text": "Production of the replicase proteins is initiated by the translation of ORF1a and ORF1ab via a -1 ribosomal frame-shifting mechanism (Bredenbeek et al., 1990) . This mechanism produces two large viral polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are further processed by two virally encoded cysteine proteases (Fig. 1) , the papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro), which is sometimes referred to as main protease (Mpro) Ziebuhr, 2004; Ziebuhr et al., 2000 Ziebuhr et al., , 2001 . Processing of the viral polyprotein is required for the release and maturation of 16 viral proteins (non-structural proteins or nsps) involved in the formation of a membrane-associated, cytoplasmic enzyme complex, the replicase complex, which is responsible for directing the replication and transcription of the viral genome. It is thought that the establishment of viral replication sites is initiated by the recruitment of replicase proteins to host membranes, a process mediated by several viral transmembrane domain-containing proteins such as the nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 (Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007; Oostra et al., 2007 Oostra et al., , 2008 van Hemert et al., 2008) .",

As a result, the viral replication mechanism is localized, increasing the concentration and cooperation of viral macromolecules and forming a framework of RNA synthesis. Most importantly, this mechanism provides a microenvironment for the protection of viral RNA from host nucleases, and of doublestranded RNA intermediates from the host cell's innate immune surveillance. Among the components of the replicase complex, nsp3 is of special interest since it is believed to be part of the central scaffolding protein of the replicase complex due to the large number of interactions with other nsp's (Angelini et al., 2013; Imbert et al., 2008; Snijder et al., 2003) .",

Next to the AC domain is a catalytically active ADP-ribose-1 00 -phosphatase (ADRP, app-1 00 -pase) domain (also called macro domain or X domain) thought to play a role during synthesis of viral subgenomic RNAs (Egloff et al., 2006; Saikatendu et al., 2005) . SARS Unique Domain (SUD), a domain not yet identified in other coronaviruses from alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, follows next (Tan et al., 2007) . The SUD domain binds oligonucleotides known to form Gquadruplexes (Tan et al., 2009) . Downstream of the SUD domain is a second Ubl domain and the catalytically active PLpro domain that proteolytically processes the nsp1/2, nsp2/3 and nsp3/4 cleavage sites (Harcourt et al., 2004) . Downstream of PLpro are found a nucleic acid-binding domain (NAB) with a nucleic acid chaperon function (Neuman et al., 2008) , which is conserved in betacoronavirus and gammacoronavirus, and one uncharacterized domain termed the marker domain (G2M) (Neuman et al., 2008) . Following the G2M are two predicted double-pass transmembrane domains (TM1-2 and TM3-4) (Neuman et al., 2008; Snijder et al., 2003) , a putative metal binding region (ZN) and the Y domain of unknown function (subdomains Y1-3) Thiel et al., 2003; Ziebuhr et al., 2001) . Interestingly, comparative genome and proteome analyses of two bovine CoV (BCoV) isolates showed a predominant clustering of mutations within the nsp3 multi-domain (Chouljenko et al., 2001) . Consequently, the multi-functionality of the nsp3, the frequency of point mutations observed in nsp3 domains, and the involvement of nsp3 in structural arrangements of the replicase complex and double-membrane vesicles may engender pleiotropic effects, not only in SARS-CoV pathogenicity, but also on future emerging coronaviruses .",

In the cytosol, the membrane associated PLpro domain recognizes the P4-P1 consensus cleavage sequence LXGG, found in the boundaries of nsp1/2, nsp2/3 and nsp3/4 where membrane association is required for cleavage of the nsp3/4 (Han et al., 2005; Harcourt et al., 2004) .

SARS-CoV PLpro is a protease, a deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating enzyme Reminiscent of the overall architecture of human deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in the ubiquitin specific protease family (USP), the molecular structure of the PLpro catalytic domain consists of a canonical, right-handed thumb-palm-fingers architecture which is flanked at the N-terminus by an additional ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain of unknown function ( Fig. 2a and b) . The in vitro characterization of PLpro enzymatic activities reveal that PLpro can recognize and hydrolyze the cellular proteins ubiquitin (Ub) (Barretto et al., 2005 Lindner et al., 2005 Lindner et al., , 2007 and the UBL protein ISG15 (interferon-induced gene 15) (Lindner et al., 2007; Nicholson et al., 2008; Ratia et al., 2014) , both bearing the LXGG recognition motif at their C-terminus (Fig. 1 , right bottom panel). Ubiquitin and ISG15 are important cellular modifiers that are covalently attached to target proteins via the formation of an isopeptide bond (Fig. 1 , right bottom panel) between their C-terminus and the e-amino group of a lysine side chain on a target protein. These isopeptide bonds can be hydrolyzed by the isopeptidase activities of DUB and deISGlating enzymes to remove Ub and ISG15 from host cell proteins. figure) .

More recently, a comprehensive analysis of PLpro substrate specificity by X-ray crystallography and mutational analyses demonstrated that two distinct Ub binding subsites (SUb1 and SUb2) exist distant from the catalytic site, providing SARS-CoV PLpro a unique bivalent mechanism of interaction with Ub-like modifier substrates (Ratia et al., 2014) . For most USPs and SARS-CoV PLpro, the primary Ub/UBL binding subsite (SUb1) is distal to the isopeptide bond and located at the boundaries of palm domain and fingers regions (Fig. 2c) . For SARS-CoV PLpro, a second, distal Ub binding subsite (SUb2) exists which is located in a ridge region of the thumb domain (Fig. 2c) . This region provides interactions for a second Ub molecule on a K48-linked di-Ub chain, and for ISG15, which has structural resemblance to K48-linked di-Ub molecules (Ratia et al., 2014) .",

Both Ub and ISG15 are important signaling elements of the host innate immune response against viral infection, which can be negatively regulated by viral DUB and deIS-Gylating enzymes (Calistri et al., 2014) . SARS-CoV PLpro has been shown to act as a strong antagonist of many Ub-dependent cellular responses to viral infection . Although the mechanism of PLpro-mediated antagonism of cellular pathways is not well understood, the evidence strongly suggests that catalytic activity is important for antagonism and, therefore, DUB and deISGylating activities have been proposed as a mechanism.",

SARS-CoV PLpro antagonistic activities have been shown to block the production of important cytokines involved in the activation of the host's innate immune response against viral infection, including the Type I interferon b (IFNb) and chemokines such as CXCL10 and CCL5. Based on the in vitro and cell culture data available on SARS-CoV PLpro and other homologous coronaviral PLPs, a summary of the possible mechanisms for how PLpro can interfere with the expression of proinflamatory cytokines, such as interferon b (IFN-b), and block the establishment of the antiviral state is illustrated in Fig. 3 . Initially, SARS-CoV PLpro was shown to interfere with the activation of the transcription factors IRF3 (Devaraj et al., 2007) and NF-jB (Clementz et al., 2010; Frieman et al., 2009) . Devaraj et al. showed that SARS-CoV PLpro-mediated antagonism of Type I interferon (IFN) production functions upstream of IRF3 activation by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation, homodimerization, and consequently nuclear translocation (Devaraj et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2012) . On the other hand, Frieman et al. demonstrated that PLpro stabilizes the NF-jB inhibitor, IjBa, and thereby blocks the activation of the NF-jB signaling pathway (Frieman et al., 2009 ). More recently, Mielech et al. demonstrated SARS-CoV PLpro ability to decrease endogenous levels of proinflamatory cytokines and chemokines in activated cells .",

Nevertheless, it is important to consider that a mutation of the catalytic machinery of PLpro may not affect its ability to interact with Ub and ISG15 molecules as the competitive inhibitor does. Therefore, a proteinto-protein interaction mediated by PLpro's strong affinity for Ub/ ISG15 molecules on ubiquitinated/ISGylated proteins could still lead to the interference of the IRF3/NF-jB signaling pathways.",

One of the oxygen atoms of the side chain of catalytic aspartic acid (Asp287) is located 2.7 \u00c5 from the tele(s)-nitrogen of the catalytic histidine at the foot of the palm domain (Fig. 4) . The side chain of Trp107 is located within the oxyanion hole and the indole-ring nitrogen is proposed to participate in the stabilization of negatively-charged tetrahedral intermediates produced throughout catalysis (Ratia et al., 2014 (Ratia et al., , 2008 . The overall tertiary structure of PLpro is remarkably similar to the cellular ubiquitin specific proteases (USP) including USP14 and USP7 (or HAUSP) (Fig. 2b) . However, in their unbound states, the catalytic triad of PLpro aligns well structurally only with the catalytic triad of USP14 and not USP7. In order for the catalytic triad of USP7 to adopt the proper orientation for catalysis, a substrate-induced alignment must occur upon association with ubiquitin or other regulatory domains (Hu et al., 2002; Molland et al., 2014; Ratia Fig. 3 . Currently proposed sites of action for SARS-CoV PLpro-mediated antagonism of the innate immune response. Viral infection is sensed by RIG-I (RIG-I-like helicase) and MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5) recognition of viral RNA. Recruitment of adaptor proteins MAVS transduces signals to the downstream kinase complex, which activates the transcription factor, IRF-3 and NF-jB, which coordinates the expression of type I interferons (IFN-b and -a). Type I IFN induces the activation of STAT transcription factors resulting in the expression of ISGs (IFN-stimulated genes) and the establishment of an antiviral state in surrounding cells. PLpro can act on different branches of these pathways by interacting with or recognizing and deISGylating and/or deubiquitinating proteins within these pathways. The net effect of these different functions is to help SARS-CoV evade the host antiviral response via antagonizing the establishment of an antiviral state. et al., 2006) . The fingers domain of PLpro, which contains a zinc ion that is tetrahedrally coordinated by four cysteines, is essential for catalysis because it maintains the structural integrity of PLpro (Barretto et al., 2005; Ratia et al., 2006) .",

Alternatively, deprotonation of Cys112 may occur during substrate binding to form the ''ES'' complex (Fig. 5, step a ). An addition-elimination sequence follows, where attack of the thiolate of Cys112 on the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond forms the first negatively-charged tetrahedral intermediate '' '' (Fig. 5, step b) . The oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized via the presence of an oxyanion hole adjacent to the PLpro enzymatic active site (Chou et al., 2014; Ratia et al., 2006 Ratia et al., , 2014 . This oxyanion hole contains a tryptophan residue (Trp107), which our group has confirmed is crucial for the enzymatic function of PLpro through site-directed mutagenesis (Baez-Santos, 2012) . In addition, we recently showed via the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV PLpro covalently modified with ubiquitin-aldehyde that indole-ring nitrogen of Trp107 acts as a hydrogen-bond donor to the hemithioacetal intermediate (Ratia et al., 2014) , confirming its function in the oxyanion hole. Furthermore, an asparagine residue (Asn110, not depicted) has been found to be highly conserved among coronaviral PLP2s and may contribute to stabilization in the oxyanion hole, as it is positioned above the catalytic cysteine. Elimination of the C-terminal amine of the substrate cleaves the peptide bond, subsequently forming the thioester intermediate ''F'' (Fig. 5, step c) . A second additionelimination sequence follows, where the nucleophilic addition of water to the carbonyl carbon of the thioester forms a second, negatively-charged tetrahedral intermediate '' step d) . The oxyanion of this intermediate is again stabilized via the oxyanion hole of the PLpro active site. Elimination of cysteine from the tetrahedral intermediate results in the formation of the N-terminal carboxylic acid ''EQ'', which may be transiently stabilized in the PLpro active site via a hydrogen-bond between the carbonyl carbon of the newly formed acid and the indole ring nitrogen of Trp107 (Fig. 5 , step e) (Chou et al., 2014) . Elimination of the cleaved N-terminus of the peptide substrate then completes the catalytic cycle where the final product ''Q'' is released from the active site and the free enzyme ''E'' is regenerated (Fig. 5 , step f).",

These warhead inhibitors typically function by first forming a noncovalent interaction complex within the cysteine protease active site, where the warhead group of the inhibitor is positioned in the proximity of the reactive cysteine nucleophile. The reaction proceeds via a nucleophilic attack of the thiolate on the electrophilic carbon of the warhead group, forming a covalently modified enzyme-inhibitor complex, which subsequently inactivates the enzyme. Examples of such reactive warhead groups that are known to inhibit cysteine proteases include aldehydes, epoxy-ketones, Michael acceptors, activated ketones, activated esters, vinyl sulfones, acrylamides, alkynes, alkylhalides, and nitriles ( Fig. 6 ) (Ghosh et al., 2005 (Ghosh et al., , 2006 Jacobs et al., 2013; Jain et al., 2004; Xue et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007) .",

The SARS-CoV PLpro enzyme was co-crystallized with a semisynthetic version of ubiquitin, where the C-terminus of ubiquitin was modified with an aldehyde functional group (Ubal). This intentional modification of ubiquitin was introduced as a way to modify the catalytic cysteine with a covalent-reversible group thereby trapping the PLpro-Ubal complex and mimicing the reaction intermediate TI-2 in Fig. 5 . The SARS-CoV PLpro-Ubal structure was determined to a resolution of 2.5 \u00c5 and is the first X-ray crystal structure of the hemithioacetal, tetrahedral intermediate in SARS-CoV PLpro ( Fig. 7a and b) . The catalytic cysteine is positioned 1.6 \u00c5 from the carbon of the tetrahedral intermediate, a distance irrefutably indicating a covalent C-S bond. The tetrahedral, hemithioacetal intermediate is stabilized via the oxyanion hole of SARS-CoV PLpro by a hydrogen bond to the indole nitrogen of Trp107, and is also within hydrogen-bonding distance to the pros(p)-nitrogen atom of His273.",

These inhibitors were identified via a yeast-based screening assay that was developed to discover inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro. The assay involved the expression of SARS-CoV PLpro in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that results in a slow-growth phenotype. A 2000 compound NIH Diversity Set library was screened for molecules capable of reversing the PLpro-induced slow-growth phenotype. Compounds identified as hits in this primary assay were then tested for efficacy against SARS-CoV replication and inhibition of PLpro function in cell culture models. This screening method resulted in the identification of NSC158362, a compound capable of specifically inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in cell culture without cytotoxic effects. However, NSC158362 was found incapable of inhibiting the protease, deubiquitinase and anti-interferon functions of PLpro -pointing to a potential new mechanism for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication. A second compound, NSC158011 was found capable of inhibiting the protease activity of PLpro in cell-based assays; however, it was unsuccessful at blocking SARS-CoV viral replication. The structures of NSC15832 and NSC158011 are shown in Fig. 8a (Frieman et al., 2011) .",

Two thiocarbonyl-containing compounds, 6MP and 6TG, were found to be effective inhibitors of PLpro with IC 50 values of 21.6 and 5 lM, respectively. In their assay, zinc ion (Zn 2+ ) was also found to be an effective inhibitor of PLpro (vide infra). Both 6MP and 6TG were found to be slow-binding, competitive, reversible, and selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro. Through comparison to molecular analogs of 6MP and 6TG that lacked the thiocarbonyl functionality, the thiocarbonyl was found to be the crucial moiety for these compound's inhibition of SARS-CoV PLpro and it is postulated to react covalently with the active site cysteine. Currently, both 6MP and 6TG are used clinically in the treatment of leukemia, and the anti-cancer action of 6TG is dependent upon its conversion to 6TG nucleotides and incorporation into DNA, preventing replication. This, and the acute toxicities associated with both 6MP and 6TG, makes them feasible as leads for future PLpro inhibitors, but not as SARS-CoV drugs themselves (Fig. 8b) ",

Analogs of (R)-7724772 were synthesized to explore the effects of adding different substituents at the ortho-and meta-positions of the benzene ring and the effects of changing the linkage to either the 1-or 2-naphthyl position. Preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis indicated that substitutions at the ortho-benzene position other than a methyl group were unfavorable and decreased binding affinity, while changing the linkage to the 1-napthyl position increased inhibitor potency by 4-fold. Addition of a nitro-substituent at the meta-position to the amide on the benzene ring decreased inhibitory potency, while addition of an amine at that same position increased inhibition of PLpro by 4-fold (Fig. 9b1) . These SAR studies guided the construction of inhibitor 24, which has a significantly increased inhibitory potency against SARS-CoV PLpro relative to 7724772 (IC 50 = 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 lM vs. 20.1 \u00b1 1.1 lM).

Interestingly, 6577871 had a 1-substituted naphthalene ring, which was found to be the more active linkage in the 7724772 series (vide supra). A small library of 6577871 analogs was synthesized to investigate the effect of substitution at the 1-or 2-naphthyl positions, at the benzylic-naphthyl position, and at positions on the benzene ring . Similar to the SAR trends found for 7724772, a 1-napthyl linkage was found to be most favorable for increased PLpro inhibition. Again, substitution of a methyl group at the benzylic-naphthyl position was found to increase inhibition; however, in the case of the 6577871 series, the stereochemistry of this chiral center had a much less dramatic effect, where the preference for an (R)-or (S)-stereochemistry changed depending upon the substituents on the benzene ring. A 2-methoxy substituent on the benzene ring was found to have a 3.5-fold decrease in inhibition, while positioning the methoxy substituent at the 3-or 4-positions on the benzene ring did not measurably change the IC 50 values. A series of benzodioxole analogs was also investigated and found to have minimally increased inhibitory potency relative to the methoxysubstituted benzene analogs (Fig. 9b2) . These studies and SAR analyses ultimately led to the generation of inhibitor 15g, which has a significantly increased inhibitory potency against SARS-CoV PLpro relative to 6577871 (IC 50 = 0.32 \u00b1 0.01 lM vs. 59 \u00b1 7.8 lM).",

Both compounds, 15g and 24, bind with their napthylmethylamine moieties positioned in the same orientation and location within the enzyme active site. The naphthyl moieties sit in a hydrophobic pocket surrounded by PLpro residues Tyr269, Tyr265, Pro248, Pro249, and Thr302. The (R)-configured methyl group of 15g extends into a small pocket that is lined with both hydrophobic and polar groups that are bound to water molecules. The piperidine nitrogen of 15g is located in an analogous position to the carboxamide nitrogen of 24, and at physiological pH the piperidine nitrogen acts as a nitrogen-centered hydrogen-bond donor, forming a hydrogen-bond with the side chain carboxylate of Asp165.

Adding a variety of substituents to the benzylic position did not increase inhibitory potency beyond that of 15g, indicating that additional functionalization at this position does not further engage the residues of the PLpro binding cavity (Fig. 10b , position R 2 ). The effect of substitution on the benzene ring was found to be completely substituent and position dependent, with no clear SAR trend; however two analogs with meta-and para-fluoro substituents were found to have the greatest PLpro inhibition, 3k and 3j (Fig. 10b, position R 3 ) . The effect of extending the linkage between the amide and benzene ring was examined and lengthening the chain by even one carbon atom was found to weaken PLpro inhibition. A variety of bioisosteres were also investigated where the W, X, Y, and Z positions (Fig. 10b) were substituted with nitrogen. In general, these bioisosteres did not increase the inhibitory potency of the compounds, with the exception of 5c, which had a similar IC 50 and EC 50 to 15g (Fig. 10b and c) .",

The higher resolution X-ray structures of 3k and 3j allowed for a more definitive placement of three conserved water molecules present in the small cavity occupied by the (R)-methyl substituent. These water molecules decrease the effective size of the cavity and support our previously described SAR for substituents at the benzylic-naphthyl position. The superposition of compounds 3k, 3j, and 15g shows a 1.0 \u00c5 difference in the position of the amide nitrogen of 15g compared to 3k and 3j, allowing a slight tilt in the orientation of the benzene ring to accommodate the different substituents (Fig. 11b) .

Additionally, as 3k has a lower topological polar surface area relative to 15g, it was expected to have increased cell permeability and subsequently, greater antiviral activity in comparison to 15g. The most potent analogs of 15g were subjected to anti-SARS-CoV assays in cell culture to determine EC 50 values, which resulted in the identification of four top compounds with good antiviral activity: 3k, 3j, 3e, and 5c (Baez-Santos et al., 2014a). To assess the potential stability of these compounds in vivo, their stability to Phase I metabolism by mouse liver microsomes was evaluated. Surprisingly, 3k was found to be rapidly metabolized; however, the compounds 3e and 5c showed significantly improved metabolic stability relative to the best first generation inhibitor, 15g (Baez-Santos et al., 2014a).

The USP class, to which coronaviral PLpro's belong, represent the largest class with 56 members. As the catalytic domains among the USP class are highly conserved, the question immediately arises as to how selective the designed inhibitors are for SARS-CoV PLpro and against human USPs? At least two approaches have been used so far in an attempt to answer this question. The first was a chemical biology approach pioneered by Hidde Ploeugh and colleagues (Borodovsky et al., 2001 (Borodovsky et al., , 2002 Love et al., 2007) . In this approach, the active-site-directed probe HA-Ub-vinyl sulfone (VS) was used to treat cellular lysates of untransfected cells and cells transfected with SARS-CoV PLpro both in the absence and presence of inhibitors (Ratia et al., 2008) . Since HA-Ub-VS potently inhibits a number of human USPs, the ability of compounds to block modification of USPs or PLpro from cellular lysates can be determined via Western blot analysis by using an anti-HA antibody. Using this approach, we found that the naphthalene-based class of inhibitors do not compete against HA-Ub-VS modification of cellular DUBs but does compete against modification of SARS-CoV PLpro.",

The crystallization conditions that yielded the SARS-CoV PLpro crystals in its unliganded state were often irreproducible or did not to produce diffraction quality crystals, preventing the crystallization of SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with inhibitors via soaking experiments. Attempts to co-crystallize SARS-CoV PLpro with inhibitors using the crystallization conditions identified for the unliganded SARS-CoV PLpro enzyme were also unsuccessful, presumably due to the tight packing interactions of SARS-CoV PLpro monomers and the positioning of the active site on the interior of the crystallographic trimer (Fig. 12a) . Eventually, co-crystals of SARS-CoV PLpro-inhibitor complexes were achieved by the screening of thousands of crystallization conditions using a crystallization robot. Ultimately, the SARS-CoV PLpro-inhibitor complexes were found to crystallize in different crystallization conditions (Table 1 ). The co-crystal of SARS-CoV PLpro-15g complex diffracted to a slightly lower resolution of 2.63 \u00c5, and similarly to unliganded SARS-CoV PLpro, it belongs to the space group C2 but with two monomers per asymmetric unit (Fig. 12b) . Crystals of the SARS-CoV PLpro-inhibitor 24 complex (also known as compound GRL0617) grew in space group I222 with one monomer per asymmetric unit and diffracted to a resolution of 2.5 \u00c5 (Ghosh et al., 2009; Ratia et al., 2008) (Fig. 12c) .

The structure of SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with compounds 3k and 3j resulted from these new crystallization conditions (Baez-Santos et al., 2014a) (Fig. 12d) . As observed for the SARS-CoV PLpro-15g complex, the co-crystals of PLpro-3k/3j complexes belong to space group C2 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. Although poorer electron density is observed for the UBL domain, the SARS-CoV PLpro-3k/3j crystals diffracted to improved resolutions of 2.1 \u00c5 and 2.5 \u00c5, respectively, and provided the basis for the crystallization and structure determination of SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with inhibitors from the same series of compounds. A summary of all SARS-CoV PLpro crystal structures and crystallization conditions reported to date is provided in Table 1 .",

The BL2 loop, which is observed in an open conformation in the unliganded SARS-CoV PLpro structure, closes upon inhibitor binding toward the catalytic cleft allowing the formation of intermolecular interactions with the inhibitors. The more closed conformation is observed with the smallest compound 24, in which a flip of the peptide bond between Gln270 and Tyr269 allows the formation of a hydrogen bond between the backbone amide of Gln270 and the carbonyl at the center of the inhibitor (Ratia et al., 2008) (Fig. 12c, right panel) . A more open conformation is observed upon binding of the larger compounds 15g, 3k and 3j, in which the BL2 loop retains the backbone orientation previously observed in the unliganded PLpro structure (Fig. 12c, right panel) . While the closing motions of the BL2 loop are driven by the induced-fit mechanism of inhibitor binding, other inhibitor-independent motions are observed at the tip of the fingers domain, which may account for PLpro's ability to interact with topologically different poly-Ub chains and the UBL modifier ISG15 (see Section 2, Fig. 2c ).",

Two different approaches were used to stabilize the SARS-CoV PLpro ubiquitin complex for cocrystallization.

The BL2 loop contributes the majority of PLpro-Ub intermolecular hydrogen bonds and plays an important role in aligning and orienting the C-terminus of ubiquitin toward the active site of PLpro. There are observable conformational differences of the BL2 loop between the two crystal structures of PLpro-Ubal and C112S-PLpro-Ub. For example, different orientations are observed for the side chain of Tyr269 (Fig. 13b ). In addition, Arg72, Arg74 and Gly76 of ubiquitin are found in different positions (Fig. 13b and c) . In the C112S PLpro-Ub complex, Gly76 is found within hydrogen bond distance of C112S and Trp107, an interaction that would not naturally occur with C112. However, in the PLpro-Ubal complex, Ub C-terminal Gly76 is found covalently bonded to Cys112 and hydrogen bonded to Typ107 and His273, corresponding to the intermediate (''FQ'') state (see also Figs. 5 and 7). The subtle shift in the positioning of the Ub C-terminal Gly76 results from the formation of a covalent (1.6 \u00c5) versus a hydrogen bond (2.5 \u00c5) with PLpro, and perhaps, this shift translates to more prominent differences in the orientations of the preceding C-terminal residues Arg72 and Arg74 of Ub. Thus, these two PLpro-Ub complex crystal structures may provide a snapshot of the transition of PLpro from the ''FQ'' to the ''E+Q'' states revealing once again the high plasticity of the BL2 loop and its interactions with substrates, intermediates, products and inhibitors.",

In addition, the BL2 bturn/loop of MERS-CoV PLpro is one residue longer which may alter the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the inhibitor and backbone atoms of Y269. In contrast, the length of the BL2 b-turn/loop is identical for HCoV-NL63 PLP2 and F271 is a conservative substitution for Y269 in SARS-CoV PLpro. The benzyl group of F271 is still fully capable of forming a T-shaped p-p interaction with the naphthalene group and the van der Waals interactions. However, subtle structural shifts surrounding the binding pocket are likely to cause the decreased inhibitory potency of the naphthalene-based series for HCoV-NL63 PLP2. The sequence and structural variability of the BL2 b-turn/loop among coronavirus suggests that design of a broad-spectrum coronavirus antiviral compound based on the naphthalene scaffold will be difficult, but a more narrow spectrum antiviral may be more readily achievable.",

The PLpro enzyme is essential for viral replication and small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme are capable of eliciting a SARS-CoV antiviral response in cell culture. The X-ray structures of SARS-CoV PLpro in complex with inhibitors provide a detailed map of the active site, which can be exploited for structure-based drug design (SBDD) of potent inhibitors. Analyses of the structural differences surrounding the active site BL2 loop indicate that the plasticity of this loop and the amino acid side chains within this loop will have a profound influence on the design of inhibitors against SARS-CoV PLpro and other coronavirus PLpro enzymes including the enzyme from the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. Finally, the SBDD approaches and studies that we have applied to SARS-CoV PLpro prove that it is entirely possible to develop highly-selective, non-covalent inhibitors against other USPs involved in disease processes.",
