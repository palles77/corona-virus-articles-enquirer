            "text": "Plague in humans is a severe febrile illness caused by the gram-negative bacillus, Yersinia pestis. Historically, it is synonymous with catastrophic epidemics. Y. pestis is maintained in nature as a zoonotic infection of rodents and their fleas in scattered foci in large areas of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is an incidental infection of humans and mammals other than rodents. Humans acquire infection most often by the bite of rodent fleas, occasionally by handling or ingesting infected animal tissues, or by inhaling contagious airborne particles. The vast majority of cases of human plague now occur in underserved Third World populations where sanitation is poor and persons live in close association with rodent reservoirs of infection. The principal clinical forms of plague are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Bubonic (lymphadenitic) plague accounts for 85% or more of primary plague cases. Septicemic and pneumonic plagues occur most often as secondary complications of bubonic plague, but may arise directly from primary infections. All forms of plague are curable if they are diagnosed and treated early. However, delays in treatment can rapidly lead to potentially fatal overwhelming infection and endotoxemia. Although plague has a high epidemic potential, preventive steps can be taken to reduce risks of exposure, and outbreaks can be readily halted using standard public health measures. Cases should be reported to health authorities immediately so that appropriate investigative and control measures can be implemented without delay. Reporting and control of the disease is mandated by national and international health regulations. Recently, concern has been raised over plague as a potential weapon of terrorism; Y. pestis has been classified as a Category A select agent subject to federal laws governing its management and transport. Medical and public health preparedness and response plans have been developed to counter the threat of its potential misuse. 1, 2 History Three pandemics of plague have been recorded. In the Justinian pandemic (circa 542-767 AD), it is thought that plague moved from upper Egypt to the Mediterranean and spread from there to Europe and Asia Minor, ultimately causing an estimated 40 million deaths. The second plague pandemic began in Central Asia early in the 14th century, caused epidemics in China and India, and moved along caravan routes to the Near and Middle East. Entering Messina by ship in 1347, plague swept swiftly through Europe and the British Isles, receiving the epithet \"Black Death.\" Medieval plague killed a quarter or more of the affected populations at its height and was followed by successive epidemics in the European region over the next several centuries. The last global surge of plague, the third (modern) pandemic, arose in the latter half of the 19th century in Yunnan Province, China, struck Hong Kong in 1894, and spread from there by ratinfested steamships to port cities throughout the world, including several in the United States. [3] [4] [5] Within 30 years of its appearance in Hong Kong, the third plague pandemic had resulted in 26 million human cases and more than 12 million deaths, most of them in India. 3 The plague bacillus was first identified in Hong Kong in 1894 by Alexandre Yersin, who isolated the organism from enlarged lymph nodes (buboes) of plague victims. 6 In 1898, Paul-Louis Simond, a French scientist sent to investigate epidemic plague in Bombay, identified the plague bacillus in the tissues of dead rats and subsequently proposed that the organism was transmitted from rat to rat, and from rats to humans by rat fleas.",

            "text": "After 1900, the global spread of plague was limited by regulations that controlled rats in ports and imposed inspection and rat-proofing of ships. Y. pestis did, however, become newly established among urban and rural rodent populations in many previously unaffected areas of the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia, resulting in scattered zoonotic foci that still exist throughout the world today. 7, 8 In San Francisco, between 1900 and 1908, major outbreaks of rat-borne plague killed more than 200 persons. By 1908, plague was epizootic in ground squirrels in counties surrounding the city, 5 and in subsequent years spread to wild rodent populations throughout California and other states in the western third of the country. The last outbreak of urban plague and of person-to-person pneumonic transmission in the United States occurred in a slum area of Los Angeles in 1924-1925. By the middle of the 20th century, cities in the United States and elsewhere had enforced higher sanitary standards and building codes, effective insecticides and rodenticides had become widely available, and several classes of antibiotics had been shown to be efficacious in treating plague. Most human plague since then has been sporadic and rural in distribution. Outbreaks have been relatively slow to develop and readily controlled by a combination of surveillance, early diagnosis and treatment, and flea and rat suppression. 9 The major exceptions to this generalization were the large ratborne plague epidemics that occurred from 1962 to 1975 in war-torn Vietnam and in the 1990s in Madagascar. 6, 10 Plague is one of the three diseases (plague, cholera, yellow fever) subject to quarantine under World Health Organization (WHO) international health regulations. 11 In 1994, articles of these regulations were used to prevent potential spread of plague from India after a reported outbreak of pneumonic plague there evoked local panic and an exaggerated international response to the perceived health emergency. 12, 13 AGENT General Microbiology Y. pestis is a nonmotile, nonsporulating, gram-negative coccobacillus in the family Enterobacteriaceae. 4, 14 It is microaerophilic, oxidase-and urease-negative, non-lactosefermenting, and biochemically unreactive. The organism is nonfastidious and is highly infective to laboratory rodents. Y. pestis grows slowly but well on a wide variety of common media (e.g., brain-heart infusion broth, sheep blood agar, chocolate agar, and MacConkey agar). Routine specimens can be safely handled under BSL-2 procedures, but manipulation of isolates requires BSL-3 measures to adequately protect laboratory workers. 14 Growth occurs across a wide range of temperature (4 \u03bf C to 40 \u03bf C) and pH (5.0 to 9.6), but is optimal at 28 \u03bf C and pH 7.4. Incubation at 37 \u03bf C for 24 hours on agar yields pinpoint, transparent colonies that are easily overlooked, especially if there is contamination of the culture by other bacteria. At 48 hours, colonies are typically gray, 1 mm to 2 mm in diameter, and have an irregular \"hammered metal\" appearance when viewed under magnification. In broth, Y. pestis grows in flocculent clumps, typically attached to the sides of the tube in downwardly projecting stalactite forms that leave a clear broth. With polychromatic stains such as Wayson, Wright, or Giemsa, plague bacilli from clinical specimens demonstrate a characteristic bipolar appearance resembling closed safety pins ( Fig. 42-1) . Although Y. pestis is not truly encapsulated, it produces an envelope that contains the unique fraction 1 (F1) glycoprotein surface antigen.",

The murine toxin (Ymt) is highly toxic to mice and rats, but is not known to be toxic in humans. In the flea midgut, Ymt (recently recognized to be phospholipidase D) plays a critical role in protecting Y. pestis from a cytotoxic digestion product of blood plasma. The emergence in Y. pestis of the single responsible gene (ymt) did, by adapting the bacillus to fleas, radically separate the natural history of the plague bacillus from that of the enteropathogenic Yersinia spp. 20 Chromosomally encoded virulence factors include a lipopolysaccharide endotoxin and a factor controlling the absorption of exogenous iron. Endotoxin is responsible for complement activation and release of cytokines. When Y. pestis is grown on media with Congo red, a heme-analogue dye, iron absorption is indicated by pigment production. Strains that do not produce pigment have diminished virulence in mammals and are unable to induce blocking in the flea gut. Hemin storage locus (hms) products expressed in the low temperature (28 o C or less) environment of the flea assist in forming blockages of the flea gut necessary for efficient transmission.

Human-to-human transmission may result from close and unprotected exposure to persons with respiratory plague. Transmission from person to person by the human flea, Pulex irritans, is controversial. Studies of plague transmission in the 20th century suggest that spread by the human flea, if it occurs, is inefficient and uncommon; however, human fleas have been proposed as an important factor in the rapid spread of plague in Europe during the Black Death.",

They travel easily with human cargo and baggage and have (with their complement of fleas) been the principal agents of noncontiguous (per saltum) spread of plague. In contrast, the Norway rat (R. norvegicus) was probably not an important host in the first two great pandemics and is thought to have first migrated from Asia to the Middle East and Europe as late as the 18th century, when it displaced the roof rat as the principal plague host in urban areas of Europe and elsewhere. R. norvegicus is larger and more aggressive than R. rattus; it is a burrowing rodent that lives around the foundations of buildings and frequents cellars, drains, sewers, alleyways, brush heaps, and refuse dumps. The quartet of R. rattus, R. norvegicus, Y. pestis, and the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, was responsible for the global spread of plague during the third (modern) pandemic. Densities of rats (measured by trapping success rates) and of fleas on rats (rat flea index) and Y. pestis infection rates of both are important surveillance measurements. 7, 9 Although domestic rats are the principal source of infected fleas in plague epidemics, they may not be able to sustain transmission of Y. pestis without reintroductions of the agent from the wild cycle. Recent investigations of bubonic plague in Maharashtra in western-central India suggested that local gerbils (Tatera indica) living in open, arid grasslands were the principal reservoirs of infection there, and that Y. pestis may have in part reached domestic R. rattus through intermediary populations of bandicoot rats (Bandicota bengalensis), which were numerous in adjacent croplands surrounding rural villages. 27, 28 The widely distributed oriental rat flea, X. cheopis, and the related species, Xenopsylla braziliensis, are efficient vectors of the plague bacillus between rats and are the most dangerous vectors to humans. 3, 7, 9 At ambient temperatures of 28 o C and below, Y. pestis can multiply exponentially in the gut of these and a few other species of fleas and result in a clotted bolus of organisms that blocks the passage of further blood meals at the level of the foregut. The starving fleas avidly seek replenishing blood meals. Regurgitation by a \"blocked\" flea while it feeds enhances transmission of the plague bacillus to a new host. The ability of Y. pestis to cause blockage has recently been shown to be plasmid-mediated and dependent on a single gene change from Y. pseudotuberculosis (see Y. pestis Virulence Factors). 19, 20 Incidental Animal Plague A diverse range of wild and domestic mammals may become incidentally infected with Y. pestis, and humans can become infected when they have direct contact with their infected tissues or exudates, or when these incidental hosts transport rodent fleas into the domestic environment. Carnivores, especially felids, canids, and mustellids, are notable incidental hosts. Infected cats, in contrast to dogs, often become ill when infected with Y. pestis and have become an occasional source of human plague in the United States. 29, 30 Lagomorphs (rabbits, hares) occasionally infect hunters and others who handle contaminated carcasses. 31 Ungulates, including antelope, deer, camels, and goats, can sicken and die from Y. pestis infection. Handling of carcasses of infected goats, camels, and dromedaries, and ingestion of undercooked meat of these animals has been responsible for limited human plague outbreaks in northern Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. 32",

            "text": "Bubonic plague is the prototypic plague illness. 3, 36, 37 The usual incubation period of bubonic plague is 2 to 6 days, occasionally longer. Illness typically begins with headache, fever of 38 \u03bf C to 40 \u03bf C, chills, myalgias, arthralgias, and a feeling of weakness. At the same time, or within 24 hours, the patient notices tenderness and pain in one or more regional lymph nodes proximal to the site of inoculation of the plague bacillus. The femoral and inguinal groups of nodes are most commonly involved, followed by the axillary and cervical nodes. Upper body sites may be relatively more involved in children than adults. The enlarging bubo(es) becomes progressively swollen, painful, and tender, sometimes exquisitely so. Typically, the patient guards against palpation and limits movement, pressure, and stretching around the bubo. The surrounding tissue often becomes edematous, sometimes markedly, and the overlying skin may be erythematous, warm, tense, and may desquamate (Fig. 42-3) . Inspection of the skin surrounding or distal to the bubo sometimes reveals the site of a flea bite marked by a small papule, pustule, scab, or ulcer. Larger pustular lesions (furuncles or carbuncles), ulcers, and eschars may rarely occur and can be confused with those caused by tularemia or anthrax. The bubo of plague is distinguishable from lymphadenitis of most other causes by its rapid onset, extreme tenderness, accompanying signs of toxemia, and usual absence of cellulitis or obvious ascending lymphangitis.",

Further, patients with sepsis often present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, making a correct clinical diagnosis even more challenging. 41 If not treated early with appropriate antibiotics and aggressive supportive care, septicemic plague is usually fulminating and fatal. In the United States from 1960 to 2004, 19 of 64 primary septicemic plague cases were fatal, yielding a case-fatality ratio of 30%. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) may progress rapidly. Petechiae and ecchymoses are manifestations of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In later stages, thrombi in the microvasculature of acral parts, such as tips of ears and digits, may result in gangrene of affected tissues. Refractory hypotension, acute renal failure, obtundation, and other signs of shock are preterminal events.

On contact with eukaryotic cells, yersiniae release LcrV into the medium and deliver six effector Yops directly into the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm through a type III secretion system. 47 Yersiniae have multiple mechanisms for suppression of the mammalian innate immune response. LcrV signals in a CD14and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent fashion leading to immunosuppression by interleukin (IL)-10 induction. 48, 49 LcrV together with YopB inhibit expression of phospho-p38, -p42/44, -JNK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and transcription factors nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, c-fos, and c-jun in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated macrophages. 50 The inhibition in the expression of these signaling molecules correlates with the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 and nitric oxide production in macrophages. 50 YopJ causes downregulation of NF-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and also causes downregulated production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1. The plague virulence protein YopM targets the innate immune response by causing a global depletion of natural killer (NK) cells, possibly by blocking expression of functional IL-15R on NK cells and inhibiting IL-15 expression by macrophages. IL-15 is crucial for the maintenance and activation of circulating NK cells as well as for their development in the bone marrow. 51 YopM, after delivery to host cells through a type III secretion mechanism, is transported to the nucleus. 51 Production of IFN-\u03b3 by NK cells is necessary for early activation of macrophages to mediate robust bactericidal activity, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and strong expression of Th1 cytokines. The depletion of NK cells during Y. pestis infection results in an early decrease in production of Th1 cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-18, and TNF-\u03b1. The loss of IFN-\u03b3 expression in the Y. pestis-infected host may contribute to the absence of granulomas. In addition, decreased IFN-\u03b3-mediated macrophage activation in Y. pestis infection favors greater bacterial growth.",

Pet dogs and cats can bring infective rodent fleas into the home environment. Infection may be transmitted directly from rodent to rodent by cannibalism, and from infected animal to predator or to human by ingestion. Humans may also acquire infection by accidental percutaneous inoculation while handling contaminated tissues or fluids.
