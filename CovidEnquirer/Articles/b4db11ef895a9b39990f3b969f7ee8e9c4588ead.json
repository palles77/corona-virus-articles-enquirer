            "text": "Background: Little is known about antiviral responses in the sinonasal mucosal tissue of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Objective: we investigated the presence of virus and the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and interferon and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in healthy mucosal tissue of control subjects and the inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of CRS patients, and evaluated whether levels of interferons and ISGs might be affected by CRS-related cytokines and by treatment with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists. Methods: The presence of virus in the sinonasal mucosa was evaluated with real-time PCR. The expression of interferons and ISGs in the sinonasal mucosa and in cultured epithelial cells treated with T H 1 and T H 2 cytokines, macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 and TLR7 agonists were evaluated with real-time PCR and Western blotting. The expression of TLR3 and TLR7 in the sinonasal mucosa were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Results: Respiratory viruses were detected in 15% of samples. Interferons and ISGs are expressed in normal mucosa, but their levels were decreased in patients with CRS. Interferon and ISG levels were upregulated in cells treated with macrolides, dexamethasone, or TLR3 agonist, but some were decreased in cytokine-treated cells. TLR3 and TLR7 levels showed no significant difference between normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. Conclusion: These results suggest that decreased levels of interferons and ISGs in patients with CRS might contribute to impairment of the antiviral innate response in inflammatory sinonasal epithelial cells. Macrolides and glucocorticoids might provide positive effects on the treatment of CRS by upregulating interferon and ISG expression. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2019;144:1551-65.)",

            "text": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogenous mucosal inflammation involving not only the paranasal sinuses but also the nose. An abnormal host response to infectious microorganisms, such as viruses and bacteria, has been suggested to be responsible for the persistent inflammation of the sinonasal mucosa. 1 Although data for the prevalence of viral infection in patients with CRS are conflicting, a high frequency of viral presence was demonstrated in nasal epithelial cells or lavage fluid of patients with CRS. [2] [3] [4] It has been suggested that viral respiratory tract infection (VRI) influences the development or progressive course of CRS through various means. 5, 6 In vitro studies demonstrated that VRIs can damage the epithelial cells covering the sinonasal cavity, resulting in dysfunction of the epithelial barrier and increased bacterial adhesion. 5, 6 The interferon response of airway epithelial cells is critical for defense against viral infection because it is required to suppress viral replication. 7, 8 Viral infection in epithelial cells lining the lower respiratory tract induces production of antiviral factors, such as type I (IFN-b) and type III (IFN-l) interferons, that contribute to virus clearance. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Both IFN-b and IFN-l are central and essential components of the interferon response of airway epithelial cells after viral infection. 9, 10 Their antiviral and immunomodulatory effects are mediated by several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), including those coding for viperin, oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1) proteins, which inhibit viral replication. 12 An abnormal innate immune response to VRIs has been reported to increase the susceptibility to viral infection in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or cystic fibrosis, triggering disease exacerbation. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Airway epithelial cells from asthmatic patients produced less IFN-b and IFN-l and showed deficient innate immunity for rhinovirus infection. 14,16 IFN-b levels were also reduced in epithelial cells obtained from children with wheezing and atopy after respiratory syncytial virus infection. 19 However, few studies have evaluated whether an apparent deficiency in antiviral immunity or the interferon response might represent a deficient innate immune response in patients with CRS.",

Cultured epithelial cells from normal sinus mucosal tissue of control subjects and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of patients with CRSwNP and those with CRSsNP were treated with various concentrations of clarithromycin or azithromycin, and cell viability was assessed by using the MTT assay. The macrolide concentrations used did not affect cell viability (data not shown). After stimulation with macrolides for 24 hours, levels of antiviral factors were measured by using real-time PCR, ELISA, and Western blotting (Figs 3 and 4) . mRNA and protein levels of IFN-b were upregulated, both in normal epithelial cells and in inflammatory epithelial cells differentiated from patients with CRSsNP who were treated with 1, 10, or 50 mmol/L clarithromycin (Fig 3, A and B) . However, IFN-b levels in inflammatory epithelial cells from patients with noneosinophilic and those with eosinophilic CRSwNP increased at 1 and 10 mmol/L clarithromycin treatment (Fig 3, A and B) .

Viruses were detected in 47% to 56% of patients with exacerbated COPD. 31 Another study reported that 16% of patients with stable COPD and 12% of healthy subjects had positive results for picornaviruses. 32 Among patients with exacerbated cystic fibrosis, 46% had positive results for respiratory tract viruses, whereas 16.9% of nasal swabs from asymptomatic patients were positive for respiratory tract viruses. 33 The rate of positive viral detection in patients with acute asthma exacerbation was 34.2%, which was significantly greater than that in patients with stable asthma (18.5%). 34 Collectively, these results suggest that the viral load is significantly greater in the exacerbation group than in the stable group. In contrast, detection rates of respiratory tract viruses in patients with CRS ranged from 0% to 75% when VRI surveillance studies in the upper respiratory tract were conducted to determine the prevalence of respiratory tract viruses in patients with CRS and control subjects without CRS, without differentiating between stable and exacerbated CRS. The authors suggested that these differences might be secondary to differences in sampling location or technique, sample size, and geography. [2] [3] [4] 35 Furthermore, it has been reported that collection of specimens during the summer months, when respiratory tract viruses are far less prevalent, might result in a lower detection rate of virus in patients with CRS. 35, 36 On the other hand, viral infections have been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis, progression, and recurrence of CRSwNP. [37] [38] [39] Several studies have reported the relative greater frequency of EBV infection in nasal polyps, suggesting a causative role in the formation of nasal polyps. 40, 41 In our study the respiratory virus detection rate was 14.28% in healthy control subjects, 16.67% in patients with CRSsNP, 18.42% in patients with CRSwNP (noneosinophilic), and 11.42% in patients with CRSwNP (eosinophilic), with no significant differences observed between normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. The lower detection rate was likely due to samples collected from patients with stable CRS without exacerbated symptoms. Therefore further studies are required to evaluate whether viral infections are responsible for acute exacerbations in CRS symptoms. Nevertheless, expression of IFN-b, IFN-l1, and IFN-l2 and ISGs was detected in both normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of all healthy control subjects and patients with CRS enrolled in the present study, despite the low viral detection rate.",

            "text": "Most CRS exacerbations occur in winter, when viral infections are more prevalent. 49, 50 These results suggest that respiratory tract viruses that cause the common cold contribute to exacerbate CRS symptoms. To assess this, we analyzed expression levels of ISGs and type I (IFN-b) and type III (IFN-l) interferons in sinus mucosal tissue and found that levels of these antiviral factors were lower in sinus mucosal tissue from patients with CRS than those in healthy sinus mucosal tissue. These data agree with results showing that defective IFN-b and IFN-l production in the bronchial airway epithelium contributes to impairment of viral control in asthmatic patients and patients with COPD. 31, 32, 34 Collectively, these data imply that low levels of these antiviral factors in inflammatory sinus epithelium might result in a deficient innate immune response to VRI in patients with CRS; furthermore, greater expression of antiviral factors in the sinonasal epithelium might protect against VRI-induced CRS exacerbation. This interpretation is supported by recent clinical trial data showing that IFN-b inhalation can effectively prevent virus-induced asthma exacerbations. 16, 51, 52 On the other hand, patients with chronic eosinophilic CRSwNP is associated with AERD, which is characterized by the presence of a peculiar mixed IL-4 and IFN-g inflammatory milieu with prominent expression of IFN-g. 22, 53, 54 These observations suggest that these mixed patterns might be responsible for altered regulation of the COX pathway. 55, 56 Although the association between viral infection and AERD has been reported in a few published studies, influenza viruses are known to use the COX-2/ prostaglandin E 2 signaling pathway for their benefit. [57] [58] [59] Taken together, these studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and pharmacologic inhibitors against COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes can be used as therapeutic drugs for viral infection. 60 We found that IFN-b, viperin, Mx1, and OAS levels decreased in cultured normal sinonasal epithelial cells treated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-a, or TGF-b. Expression of suppressor cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) mRNA reportedly increased in bronchial epithelial cells of children with severe asthma accompanied by impaired interferon production and increased viral replication. 61 When primary bronchial epithelial cells of healthy subjects were exposed to rhinovirus, suppression of both IFN-l and IFN-b was mediated by TGF-b. 62 Other studies showed that IL-13 inhibits IFN-b and IFN-l1 expression in lung epithelial cells infected with rhinovirus, which is suggestive of a connection between T H 2 cytokine activity and interferon expression. 47 Human bronchial epithelial cells pretreated with IL-4 and IL-13 also significantly inhibited rhinovirus-induced IFN-b expression. 44 Together, these data suggest that CRS-related cytokines might reduce the innate immune response to viral infection, suppressing IFN-b, viperin, Mx1, and OAS expression. Further studies are needed to clarify these issues.",

Although the mechanism of the antiviral effect of macrolides has not been determined, clarithromycin was suggested to mediate the antiviral effects through decreased intercellular adhesion molecule 1, IL-6, and IL-8 production. 65 Azithromycin upregulates antiviral substrate interferons, preventing virus-induced episodes. 66 Azithromycin antiviral activity in bronchial cells from patients with cystic fibrosis was also associated with stimulation of antiviral mechanisms through increased expression of interferons and ISGs. 67 These results suggest that azithromycin pretreatment reduces rhinovirus replication, possibly by amplifying the interferonmediated antiviral response. In this study both clarithromycin and azithromycin upregulated the levels of antiviral factors, including interferons, in cultured normal and inflammatory epithelial cells from healthy control subjects, patients with CRSwNP, or patients with CRSsNP, respectively. Consequently, clarithromycin and azithromycin might be useful as interferon inducers for treating virus-associated CRS exacerbation. In contrast, telithromycin, a 16-membered macrolide, did not reduce rhinoviral replication. 68 Therefore expression of antiviral factors might be induced differently, depending on the types of macrolides.",

In contrast, Thomas et al 71 demonstrated that glucocorticoid treatment increases viral replication in pulmonary bronchial epithelial cells without a significant reduction of IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFN-l levels both in vitro and in vivo. However, Bochkov et al 72 found that the glucocorticoid budesonide did not affect rhinovirus replication or interferon production in vitro, suggesting that the effect of glucocorticoids on viral infection might vary depending on the cell type and experimental environments. Further research is required to solve these issues.",

These data suggest that the roles of TLR3 and TLR7 in interferon induction are not impaired in inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. However, TLR3 stimulation with poly (I:C) led to upregulation of IFN-b, IFN-l1, IFN-l2, and ISGs in cultured normal and inflammatory epithelial cells, whereas R848-treated cells showed no interferon response. These data highlight that inflammatory epithelial cells might have the capacity to produce interferons and ISGs by activating TLR3 and suggest that the interferon response in patients with CRS might mediate host defenses, inhibiting virus-induced exacerbations.",
