Objectives: (1) To develop and validate a real-time PCR method for hMPV diagnosis. (2) To determine the percentage of hMPV in respiratory specimens from the community and its association with outbreaks in our geographic area. (3) To provide epidemiological data in terms of age distribution, seasonality and co-infections. Study design: A real-time PCR assay was designed for detection of hMPV lineages A and B. Prospective testing for hMPV over a 22-month period was then undertaken. Results: The real-time PCR was sensitive and specific for detection of both lineages of hMPV. hMPV was detected in 9.5% (n = 8239) of the specimens and 25% of the outbreaks (n = 100) tested. The hMPV-positive patients ranged in age from 18 days to 99 years with a median age of 24 months. The number of positive samples peaked during the winter months of December, January and February. A high rate of co-infections was noted in the samples tested. Conclusions: hMPV is common in the community and is associated with outbreaks. Including hMPV in routine testing improves etiological diagnosis of acute respiratory infections.",

Detection and analysis of hMPV by culture or antigen testing has proved difficult and may lack sensitivity compared with nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) (Boivin et al., 2002; Gerna et al., 2006; van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . There are two major lineages of hMPV and each of the lineages is represented by two sub-lineages (Boivin et al., 2004; van den Hoogen et al., 2004a,b) . Limited sequence diversity has been observed in the fusion (F) gene making it a good target for detection by NATs (Agapov et al., 2006; Galiano et al., 2006; Kuypers et al., 2005; van den Hoogen et al., 2004a,b; Winther et al., 2005) . We have developed a real-time PCR amplification and detection assay for hMPV with primers and hydrolysis probes targeting the F gene. Here we report the development, validation and performance of the hMPV assay as well as our observations of hMPV seasonality, a Upper respiratory specimens include nasopharyngeal samples (including swabs and fluids), throat swabs and other nasal specimens. Lower respiratory specimens include bronchial and tracheal specimens, tissue and fluid include biopsy samples, pleural, chest, and pericardial fluid.

The forward and reverse primers for lineage A were hMPV-For1taqman and hMPV-Rev1-taqman, respectively. Two forward primers (hMPV-For2-taqman and hMPV-For2a-taqman) and one reverse primer (hMPV-Rev2-taqman) were designed for the amplification of lineage B strains. A universal minor groove binding probe hMPV-Uni-Fam was designed to simultaneously detect both lineages of hMPV. Two lineage-specific probes hMPV1-Probe and hMPV2-Probe labeled with FAM and VIC, respectively were also designed and used for detection and differentiation between lineages A and B viruses in a real-time multiplex format. The primer and probe sets were compared to all four predicted prototype sequences A1, A2, B1, and B2 (van den Hoogen et al., 2004a,b) (Gen-Bank accession nos.: AF371337, AY304360, AY304361, and AY304362) to ensure that all lineages would be amplified and detected using this assay.

Serological studies show that the virus has been circulating undetected in humans for at least 50 years (van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . It is thus an important pathogen and it is essential to obtain a better understanding of the associated disease and risk factors. There are two major lineages of hMPV and each of the lineages is represented by two sub lineages (Boivin et al., 2004; van den Hoogen et al., 2004a,b) . The two genetic lineages are antigenically highly related but not serotypically distinct (MacPhail et al., 2004; Skiadopoulos et al., 2004; van den Hoogen et al., 2004a,b) hindering serological detection and differentiation based on antibody assays. The lineages can, however, be differentiated using molecular methods. We have developed and applied a real-time PCR test for the detection of hMPV in respiratory samples. We have used this assay to determine the percentage and seasonal distribution of hMPV infections in respiratory specimens from our community and have assessed its association with community respiratory outbreaks. Nucleic acid amplification-based protocols for the detection of hMPV have been published based on the F, nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and polymerase (L) genes (Agapov et al., 2006; Boivin et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2003; Cote et al., 2003; Ebihara et al., 2004; Esper et al., 2003; Falsey et al., 2003; Gerna et al., 2006; Kuypers et al., 2005; Mackay et al., 2003; Maertzdorf et al., 2004; Stockton et al., 2002; van den Hoogen et al., 2003) . Studies have shown that the sequence diversity in the F gene from patient samples is limited (Agapov et al., 2006; Galiano et al., 2006; Kuypers et al., 2005; van den Hoogen et al., 2004a,b; Winther et al., 2005) . Our assay is highly sensitive for detection of hMPV and the sensitivity is comparable when the assay is performed using the lineage A, lineage B or universal probes. Although we have not compared our newly developed assay with those previously reported, the limit-of-detection studies suggest that the assay is comparable in sensitivity to other reported nucleic acid detection methods for hMPV.",

The results of our study are consistent with reported literature; we observed the frequency of hMPV infections in respiratory specimens to be 9.4% overall in patients ranging in age from 18 days to 99 years, but was as high as 16.3% of all tested specimens in January 2006. It should be noted that our positive rate could be underestimated as DFA-positive samples would not be tested for hMPV by NAT according to our current diagnostic testing algorithm. The median age for hMPV infections has been reported to vary between 6 and 12 months (Kuypers et al., 2005; Mullins et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2004) however two of these studies investigated a pediatric population and one included adults only up to the age of 20 years. Our data shows a median age of 24 months and indicates a higher incidence of hMPV infection in the young (less than 24 months of age).",

The seasonality of hMPV may thus vary geographically and continued surveillance over a number of years will help in understanding these patterns. It has been suggested that hMPV circulates predominantly in late winter and spring in the temperate climates; however, it has been detected throughout the year at lower levels (Kahn, 2003) .",

The most common co-infecting viruses were parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses, influenza B virus, RSV and influenza A in the order of prevalence with a tendency towards higher co-infection rate in patients less than 2 years of age. Other reports have suggested that RSV and influenza A are the most prevalent co-infecting agents Kuypers et al., 2005; Viazov et al., 2003) , but based on our data, co-infections seem to depend on other common viruses circulating in the community. A higher proportion of co-infections was noted for upper respiratory specimens. One of the reasons for this could be that nasopharyngeal samples are the most common type collected from children. The patients for whom lower respiratory samples were submitted are unselected and may include individuals with disease processes other than viral infection thus diluting the rate of identifiable pathogens in these specimen types. In addition, collection of BAL specimens includes a saline instillation and suction process that could have diluted the viral load in a sample. Increased use of sensitive NATs for respiratory viruses that are poorly detected by traditional methods facilitates identification of multiple viruses from a single sample.",
