This guide demonstrates methods of soil bioengineering-using rocks, soil and vegetation native to a site to repair damaged banks and shorelines-instead of using artificial materials such as concrete. The first three chapters describe the characteristics and functions of watersheds, riparian ecosystems and streams and rivers. The remaining chapters give well-illustrated instructions on planning and conducting a repair project. This interesting publication examines how race, social class, gender, politics, and labor market experiences affected the development of environmentalism in America in the 19th and 20th centuries. The author sees these factors as influencing the rise of four major pathways of environmental activism. Chapters focus on wilderness, wildlife, and recreation; urban environmentalism; the white working class; people of color; gender relations among people-of-color groups; and people of color and environmental justice. Interested readers will find the extensive list of references helpful. Forests are an important natural resource in the United States; this report compares forestry in the United States with that in three Nordic countries where it is also important. The report discusses the amount and distribution of forests in each country; ownership, use and management of the forests, and the place of forestry in the national economies. The report gives particular attention to government policies in the United States and Norway that can affect privately owned forests, and the prospects for these policies to protect the forests.",

They can cause economic and environmental damage by crowding out native species and may harm humans-by being poisonous or allergenic, for example. This book explains how to use a plant's natural enemies to curb invasive species. The book is divided by type of habitat and has detailed descriptions of the invasive species found in that habitat. Each description explains why the plant considered a pest, how to identify it, its biology and native area, and recommendations for controlling it.",

The United States has jurisdiction over about 7607 square miles of tropical coral reefs (p. 1). This is the first of proposed biennial reports, and tries to collect in one place the available data on the conditions of these reefs. The report details threats to coral reefs-such as storms, diseases, and pollution-discusses their importance in specific areas, and outlines government remediation efforts. It also discusses the progress of mapping efforts.

The book describes various types of fishing and the experiences of commercial and recreational fishermen (and women). It describes the problems faced by fisheries today, such as over-fishing and habitat degradation. There are separate chapters on the fisheries of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The book contains abundant illustrations of fish, fishing activities and equipment, restaurants, and, of course, seafood, from fancy lobsters and sushi to the tuna fish sandwich. This guide is intended to help law enforcement agents responsible for regulating coral trade, but it is a good general field guide for anyone interested in this topic. The guide is organized to allow the reader to quickly identify a coral that he or she has seen. The book is arranged by type of coral, and a list of descriptive questions directs the reader to the appropriate page for a particular type of coral. For each type of coral there are close-up photographs of the living organism and of its skeleton (used in jewelry and other goods). This staff report examines percentage plans in California, Florida, and Texas that were created to foster diversity in higher education by using class rank as a basis for guaranteed admission. In addition, this report looks at admission standards and success predictors, national trends in college enrollment, and federal assistance in facilitating equal access. The report finds that ''[a]s affirmative action comes increasingly under fire, and if percentage plans grow in popularity, it is inevitable that the numbers, and subsequently proportions, of minority students pursuing higher education will decrease'' (p. xiii).",

The Missile Defense Agency joins the effort with this report describing technologies that the agency has funded which have counterterrorism applications. The inventions are divided among chemical and biological countermeasures, surveillance and information collection devices, and cyber warfare devices. There is a one-page description of each invention, with its production status and contact information. Although a predominant image of victory in the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf War is that of smart bombs, the war on the ground was also key to the success of coalition efforts. This substantial volume examines the ground war through a study of some the complex activities of the U.S. Army's VII Corps. The author looks at the role of technology, initiative, command and control, and the attention devoted to planning, training, and execution. Numerous illustrations and maps supplement the text.

The accompanying chart provides a quick chronological summary of major aerospace events, technological advances, and aircraft and munitions developments. This history describes the strategic air campaign against Iraq, which was the part of the overall air operations that attacked military and economic targets in Iraq itself, during the first Persian Gulf War.

It outlines the history of the United States' nuclear weapons from Einstein's theory of relativity to today's enormous complex of laboratories and production facilities. The book covers early nuclear research, the Manhattan Project, testing, the Cold War and its aftermath. An especially interesting chapter covers the German atomic bomb project during WWII, which was derailed by Norwegian commandos who destroyed the Germans' supply of heavy water, necessary for one method of bomb making. This book, generously illustrated with photos, diagrams, and snippets of oral history, documents the history of the Savannah River Site nuclear research and production facility. The book describes not only the enormous construction and engineering efforts that went into building the site, and the scientific developments that were made there, but the social impact the facility made on the South Carolina area where it is located. The book is very readable despite its technical subject matter. There are additional sections on the history of nuclear science and on environmental protection at the site. This guide, prepared by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy, aids business and residential consumers in deciding whether to buy a solar electric system and what type of system to buy. The guide discusses reasons for buying a solar electric system, where systems can be located, types and sizes of systems, selecting a provider, and financing the purchase. Although this booklet is targeted to the Midwest, and has information on solar programs there, the text of the guide is applicable to any area. This commission examined and made recommendations regarding current Federal standards for measuring equal opportunity for male and female participation in school sports under Title IX and for improving the effectiveness of Title IX. The report indicates that the recommendations were grounded in the themes of commitment, clarity, fairness, and enforcement. Controversy surrounded the release of this report as two commission members withdrew their support from several recommendations and prepared a separate minority report, which the Secretary of Education refused at that time to include as part of the commission's official report. Following on the committee's 2001 report, Access Denied: Restoring the Nation's Commitment to Equal Educational Opportunity, this report states that ''nearly one-half of all college-qualified, low-and moderate-income high school graduates-over 400,000 students fully prepared to attend a four-year college-will be unable to do so, and 170,000 of these students will attend no college at all'' (p. v). Chapters discuss these financial barriers, the resulting impacts on students, and national consequences. The committee considers a number of implications for Federal policy. Average geography scores for 4th-and 8th-graders were higher in 2001 than in 1994, while 12th-graders performed at approximately the same level. This is one of the findings of the 2001 National Assessment of Educational Progress survey on student achievement in the core subject area of geography. This report discusses average scale scores and achievement-level results for both the nation and for selected subgroups, classroom contexts for learning, and results for special-needs students. This kit provides materials for teachers to demonstrate the effects of climate change on nature. The kit includes a wheel card about the pollution emitted by common household activities and methods for reducing it, a video, and flash cards about vulnerable species and habitats. The bulk of the materials in the kit are on the CD-ROM. There are fact sheets and case studies, puzzles and coloring pages, a slide show, and video. Educators can choose materials for different age groups and different settings, such as a classroom or outdoor setting. Floatable debris, trash and other types of waste that float on the surface or drift underneath the water, presents hazards to wildlife and humans. This report examines the sources of this type of pollution and the impacts it has on communities and the environment. The report also discusses techniques for assessing the prevalence of floating pollution and for remediation of it, including detailed case studies. Any community that resides near a body of water would find this publication of interest. This book presents the argument that restoring and protecting natural floodplains could lower the amount of flood damage done every year. In making the argument, the book gives a good overview of what floodplains are and how they serve wildlife and humans. The book also discusses the effects of human activities on floodplains and government efforts regarding them. Several case studies are included. This report would be of interest to anyone studying water resources or the environment. This report examines data gathered after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, regarding the performance of the seven World Trade Center buildings and some additional buildings located near the complex. The report discusses the design and construction of each building, its fire protection and emergency exit systems and other relevant features, and the types of damage that each sustained on September 11. The report brings this data together to attempt to discover why the Twin Towers collapsed, and factors that aggravated or mitigated the damage to all of the buildings. This fascinating document has data on the type of nutrition-related claims made in food advertising for the 20-year period of 1977-1997. Beyond presenting the information and statistics, the goals of this report are to foster understanding of the economic forces driving the advertising marketplace and the incentives for such advertising provided to businesses by government policies. Many of the tables present regression analysis for diseases and affiliated claims. An appendix lists the FTC Food Advertising Cases during those 20 years. With Americans investing $30 billion annually in weight-loss products and services, the FTC's critical analysis of weight loss advertising is long overdue. It identifies the messages of marketers and examines the claims made in nine categories such as consumer testimonials and rapid weight-loss. Since it was found that more than half of the ads made at least one claim that was either false or unsubstantiated, the report concludes that there is room for improvement. The appendices feature list of specific products and questionable claims.",

            "text": "The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity. This document presents the results of a national conference to address the needs of children, adolescents, and adults who have a mental retardation and thus experience poorer health and more difficulty in obtaining and paying for health care. Six goals, which are further divided into action steps and potential strategies, address increasing knowledge and understanding, improving the quality of health care, fostering health promotion and community environments, training health care providers, ensuring effective financing, and increasing sources of health care. Together, these two volumes present the data and the methodology used in the first report of state estimates from the 2000 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA). As well as illicit drugs these include information on both alcohol and tobacco which are, respectively, the first and second most popular substances used in the United States. State estimates for 17 measures related to substance use are offered with Volume I displaying some of the results in color map form. Volume II has model-based tables for each state as well as descriptions of the statistical models and the data limitations. Because women in the developed world will live more than 1/3 of their life in postmenopause, menopause and women's health is a rapidly expanding field of medical practice and research. The purpose of this report is to enhance women's health globally. Menopause and aging, sociocultural issues, hormone replacement therapy, and other topics are discussed. Future needs are identified while best clinical practices and suggested readings in systematic reviews and recent clinical trials are included. With 1 in 10 children and adolescents suffering from a mental illness severe enough to cause functional impairment, this report reviews the current state of research and the personnel needs for such activities. It also puts forward recommendations for future research and treatment. Research areas include neuroscience, behavioral science, prevention, psychopharmacology, psychosocial interventions, and the dissemination of such research. Much of the document is made up of the appendices that have a case study of childhood depression, mental health utilization and costs, and other information. The final report of the Task Force on College Drinking: Panel on Contexts and Consequences gives an overview of college student drinking with an emphasis on ''binge drinking.'' Sections include a review of the epidemiology; discussions of the damage done to the student, others, and the institution; issues for college administrators and policymakers; research considerations; multidimensional factors encompassing the developmental, individual, and environmental areas; and opportunities for intervention. An extensive bibliography, statistical tables, and a short glossary of alcohol terminology are available. Although excessive college student drinking is not a new problem, there is now significant research suggesting preventive strategies. This final report summarizes relevant research, reviews public policy aspects including laws, discusses the current media and social norming approaches, makes recommendations as to what colleges and universities can do, and identifies research gaps. An appendix has responses to arguments against the lowering of the minimum legal drinking age as several states consider this action. There are more people in the world consuming more material goods than ever before: Can technology keep up with the demand for goods without destroying the environment? This publication examines this question through ''material flows,'' the life cycle of a material, such as mercury, from its acquisition through its use and disposition. The chapter on scarcity discusses ways in which technology can delay or prevent the exhaustion of nonrenewable resources. The chapter on the environment discusses pollution as a by-product of our use of materials and pollutants as materials themselves. Safe drinking water is of great concern in the United States today: managers of drinking water systems must find ways to ensure that their sources remain uncontaminated. This report discusses a number of ways that water officials can determine the ease with which local ground water could be polluted by man-made or natural contaminants. The report takes particular care to ensure that these evaluation methods are objective and scientific. This volume is part of a series and covers the glaciers of Canada, the conterminous United States, and Mexico. There are articles on the characteristics of the glaciers in these countries, and discussions of how the glaciers were mapped. There is also an article on the history of glacier study in Canada. The articles are illustrated with photographs and maps as well as satellite images. The Kukak Cannery operated from 1923 through 1949 and was a significant processing site for the West Coast commercial clamming industry. The National Park Service has jurisdiction over the vestiges of this site and has produced this fascinating volume as part of its efforts to preserve and interpret meaningful elements of Alaska's history. Numerous historical and contemporary photographs beautifully complement the text, which describes the establishment and structure of the cannery; the ecology, collection, and processing of the razor clams; the lives of the cannery workers; and the site's gradual return to nature since the closing of the cannery. Although there are many histories of Yellowstone National Park, the authors see gaps in these histories' representations of American Indians and offer this work as a reexamination of the roles played by Indians in the history of the park and an invitation for more such research and reassessment. The authors present an absorbing narrative of the lives and culture of the Indian peoples in and around the park area, based on analysis of numerous and sometimes little-studied archival materials and ethnographic records as well as discussions with contemporary Indian representatives. Although Sitka is not an area where totem poles have historically originated, it is now a location with an incredible collection of poles, the history of which is being detailed for the first time in this volume. Illustrations appearing on almost every page complement the text, which discusses totem poles in general, the coastal Native Alaskan culture, how the these poles came to be in Sitka, and how they have been preserved over time. An appendix provides individual histories for several specific totem poles. These 10 papers comprise a selection from NIJ's more extensive collection of gang-related research. Chapters present the results of research in areas such as the evolution of street gangs; the risk factors, delinquency, and victimization risk of young women in gangs; and youth gang homicides. Various law enforcement approaches such as deterrence, the use of task forces, prosecution, and development of a GIS-based incident tracking system are discussed. While the research provides much useful information, it is clear that many questions still exist. Advances in DNA testing and databases are causing law enforcement agencies to reevaluate unsolved cases. This report describes these advances: it describes different types of DNA tests and their uses, DNA databases and their use, sources of DNA, and legal and other considerations for reopening old cases. The report is intended to aid law enforcement in deciding whether DNA evidence might help solve an old or new case, but could also be very interesting to the layperson. This well-constructed volume presents the fascinating early history of the lower federal courts in the mid-Atlantic southern states that comprise the current Fourth Circuit. Divided into three major parts (The Early Republic's Third Branch; Courts, Law and Jeffersonian Ascendancy; and National Unity, Seeds of Discord in the Age of Marshall), this book discusses topics ranging from judicial organization and power to nation-state relations, economic development, and political and social control. Not only is this the story of the district and circuit courts and judges but also of the interaction between these judges and their U.S. Supreme Court colleagues during this important period of nation building. The ''worst forms of child labor'' can include slavery, the forced recruitment of children for use in armed conflict, use of a child in prostitution or for pornographic purposes, use of children in illicit activities such as drug trafficking, and work likely to harm the health, safety, or morals of children (p. 1). This report, comprised of profiles for 124 countries and a summary for 19 territories and nonindependent countries, offers information on government policies and programs to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, the incidence and nature of child labor, and child labor laws and enforcement. Child labor in countries around the world continues to be an issue of major concern to many. Volume I-Efforts at the Country Level-consists of 33 detailed profiles that describe each country's situation regarding the incidence and nature of child labor, children's participation in school, child labor law and enforcement, representative efforts to address child labor and to promote school, and selected data on government expenditures. Volume II-Addressing the Worst Forms of Child Labor-provides a look at strategies and describes three such projects. One of the Library of Congress's series of informative and enjoyable guides to its collections, this latest publication focuses on the variety, depth, and importance of its audiovisual collections. ''Thanks to recorded sound and moving images, our times will be better known and understood than preceding centuries'' (p. 5). Chapters interweave historical background, information about the Library of Congress's collections and activities, and numerous illustrations to present an interesting overview of the development and impacts of sound recordings, motion pictures, radio, and television in American history. This booklet would be a good accompaniment to a science class. It describes the mission of the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), particularly its mission to document changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The satellite will also examine the distribution of clouds and aerosols in the region, and land surface and vegetation around the world. In discussing the reasons for these missions, the booklet covers such issues as climate change and sea level rise. There is also an explanation of how the satellite works and how its data is interpreted. In his memoir, aeronautical engineer Seth Anderson gives a brief history of Ames Research Center in California and describes his personal experiences with flight-testing many different aircraft for performance and safety, including WWII fighter planes, a blimp and even a flying saucer. The text is very readable, with a glossary to explain technical terms. A pictorial section comprises the largest part of the memoir, showing the aircraft, grounds, and people of the research center. The year 2003 is the 120th anniversary of the Civil Service Act of 1883, which was a milestone in the history of the federal government and its personnel system. While not an indepth account, this publication does describe the initial premerit years of public service (which was not originally a ''spoils system''), development of the merit system, the beginning of modern personnel administration, the second period of civil service reform in the late 1970s, and postreform activities. This publication expresses the themes of the Bush Administration's national security strategy, a strategy that ''. . .will be based on a distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests'' (p. 1). These themes include strengthening alliances to defeat global terrorism, working with others to defuse regional conflict, limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction, promoting free markets and free trade, encouraging the development of democracy in other societies, and transforming America's national security institutions. As the first report from the President's Council on Bioethics, this avoids narrow considerations to instead see human cloning as a ''. . .turning point in human history. . ..'' (Letter of Transmittal). The majority recommends that a 4-year moratorium be placed on attempts to create cloned cells for medical research while a substantial minority sees such a delay as hindering important research and the development of medical therapies. There is a helpful glossary of terms and the Appendix includes personal statements by some Council members. This is the first elucidation of a national strategy for homeland security and the basis for one of the most far-reaching reorganizations in the history of the U.S. federal government: the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security. It identifies six key mission areas including domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infrastructure, and intelligence and warning. The strategy sees four foundations to homeland security: law, science and technology, information sharing and systems, and international cooperation. This book is an exhaustive military history of the armed conflicts in the former Yugoslavia from 1990 to 1995. It is based on unclassified CIA intelligence reports. Aside from describing in detail the actual battles, this book does a good job of sorting out the many factors that caused the breakup of Yugoslavia: the government and politics, economics, military strategy, and ethnic tensions. The narrative is accompanied by 80 maps to allow the reader to locate and follow the course of the battles and other significant events. The third study examining the depiction of substance portrayal in the mass media popular with U.S. adolescents, this looks at music videos. Two hundred fifty-eight videos were examined with results presented for the presence of illicit drugs, alcohol, tobacco, or over-thecounter and prescription drugs. Although less frequently found here than in other media, 45% of the sample portrayed at least one of these substances. When present, they were generally consumed with such consumption usually shown to be a pleasant and rewarding experience. Today much of our weather data is gathered from rockets and satellites, but weather balloons still provide important information. This book is a history of the radiosonde, a balloon carrying a device that collects atmospheric data and transmits it back to earth via radio. The development of the radiosonde is traced from early experiments with balloons and kites, ala Benjamin Franklin, to the present day. As well as being the history of an invention, this book is, in part, a history of the study of weather and the atmosphere. Washington, DC 20560-0950.] This volume is dedicated to retired Smithsonian curator Clayton E. Ray and contains a biography of him and a bibliography of his works. The bulk of the book, however, consists of papers by his colleagues on fossil species of mammals from the Cenozoic era, his area of expertise. Some of the species covered include early dolphins and seals, vampire bats, and giant wombats. The papers are written in scientific and technical language that may not be suitable for all readers, but the topics should attract anyone interested in fossils and extinct species. When highways cross wildlife habitats they prevent animals from roaming in their natural patterns. This fragmenting can adversely affect the health of the habitat and threaten the safety of motorists and animals through highway collisions. This report is the result of an ''international technology scan'' in which five European countries were visited to see how they addressed the problem. Solutions range from vegetation-covered overpasses to allow animals to cross the highway in safety to specially designed drainage systems that do not entrap lizards and other small animals. International travel and transportation were negatively impacted by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and although slowly rebounding since that time, may be adversely affected again by concerns about war in the Middle East region. Through text, tables, and charts, this report describes recent trends for North American and overseas travel into and out of the United States. Special attention is paid to international air travel. The report concludes that while the demand for international travel is uncertain, ''. . .it is clear that pressure on border and gateway infrastructure as well as inland transportation systems, will continue, especially given new security concerns'' (p. 38). Believing that the U.S. ''relationship with China is one of the most important bilateral relationships of our nation'' (p. 1), the Commission examines many economic and national security aspects of the relationship in its first report. Among these are China's perception of the United States, China's growth as a regional economic power, trade and investment, political and civil freedoms, China's presence in U.S. capital markets, cross-strait security issues, and technology transfers. The large documentary annex includes commissioned research papers, translated materials, and selected briefings, papers, and reports. While federal assistance for housing has helped many people, an urgent problem still exists for many poor households who cannot find affordable housing since the demand for such housing exceeds the supply. After a brief discussion of America's housing challenges and the federal role in housing, a substantial portion of this report details principal and supporting recommendations to Congress. The included CD-ROM contains hearing testimony and statements submitted during other commission-sponsored meetings. By presenting ''the best information available about how adults learn to read'' (p. vii), this publication hopes to aid educators and policy makers who work with adult reading instruction and inspire researchers to develop new lines of study in this area. Principles, trends, ideas, and comments are identified in the areas of reading assessment profiles, alphabetics (phonemic awareness and word analysis), fluency, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and computer technology and adult basic education reading instruction. MedPac is an independent agency created to advise Congress on issues affecting Medicare. This report assesses the Medicare benefit package by examining the existing package along with several possible changes that would provide better access to care without increasing overall resources devoted to such efforts. As would be expected, there are many statistical tables outlining and helping to explain the various scenarios and recommendations. An appendix notes sources of additional coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. As this author sees it, ''. . .the moral issues raised by the question whether to wage humanitarian war go to the heart of the ethical justifications available for any form of military intervention'' (p. 5). This succinct and interesting document discusses, among other things, the just war tradition and defense against aggression, the burdens to be met for just war and humanitarian intervention, and some of the issues to be faced in the future.",

This publication is an anthology of papers examining various aspects of infrastructure protection. The papers identify critical infrastructure elements and get different perspectives, such as those from business and the military, on protecting them in an organized manner. The CBO's analysis projects that ''. . .defense resources could reach levels greater than those sustained during the Cold War. However, the fraction of the country's economic activity that they constitute, and their share of the total federal budget, could be significantly smaller than during the Cold War'' (p. xiii). While this report briefly notes implications for operation and support items such as training, there are more extensive discussions for each individual branch of the American armed forces as to the implications for the investment funding of research, development, testing, and evaluation or procurement of weapons systems. With colorful and catchy graphics, this site is designed primarily to address the health issues of young women from the ages of 10 to 16 but also touches upon some common social situations. A Parent/Caregiver section is especially rich with resources and links to information. Included also are the full text of publications in eight categories such as risky behavior, disabilities, and fitness/nutrition. A glossary has definitions of such concepts as eating disorders while other sections offer tips on relationships, families, and self-esteem. This site allows users to search for and get specific items from more than 30 of NARA's archival series of electronic databases; at this time, this represents access to over 50 million unique records. Series run the gamut from various war casualty and prisoner of war files to major collective bargaining settlements to indexes of NASA photographs. Helpful information is provided for researchers on getting started in searching for records, understanding a data file's context, and AAD system terminology. Although not easy to navigate without a sidebar Table of Contents, this report nevertheless is an important exploration of the long-term health care issues of American Indians and Alaska Natives. Five chapters, written by different authors, are formed around discussion papers related to such topics as Medicaid financing and the integration of the teachings of elders and tribal values into any plan. Attachments serving as appendices offer a Nursing Home Survey Report, a university study on functional limitations affecting long-term care, and other background information.",

            "text": "As a companion educational site to the Dream Anatomy exhibition at the National Library of Medicine, this has a collection of images and artifacts representing human anatomical illustrations from 1500 to the present. It includes lesson plans for grades 6-12, a fascinating gallery of anatomy illustrations, and a short ''History of Anatomy'' timeline beginning in 275 BCE. It traces changing anatomical representation from the ''Body Part as Body Art'' to realism. Of particular note are the changes brought about by the introduction of the printing press, color, and the X-ray. A true consumer-orientated site if ever there was one, this is a straightforward gateway to many health-related resources. At the top of the introductory page are broad subject categories such as accidents and injuries, cancer, child health, drugs and medicine, teeth, and others. Most noteworthy among these are the long sections devoted to Spanish-language sites and short videos covering a wide range of topics. A variety of governmental, educational, and organizational groups sponsor the sites. Calling itself the first comprehensive examination of Continuums of Care, this report examines systems which are meant to provide an integrated complement of services for homeless people including ''. . .prevention, outreach and assessment, emergency shelter, transitional housing, permanent supportive housing, and affordable housing, plus supportive services in all components'' (p. ix). The study looks at local homeless assistance systems, how clients navigate through the system, the involvement of mainstream agencies and services, coordination of services for homeless people, and implications from its findings. In preparation for the winter months, one can consult this site for a comprehensive discussion of the flu. There are sections with statistics on the prevalence of cases; background of the disease including symptoms, how it is transmitted, and treatment; prevention and control; a description, with pictures, of the viruses; questions and answers; and information for health care providers including who should be vaccinated, the current supply of vaccine, and preventing the flu among travelers. An interesting section offers a history of the flu describing, among others, the 1918-1919 pandemic. A resource truly designed for the consumer, this offers a dozen or so short but specific reviews of the latest research findings in the areas of food and nutrition. They range from a description of the benefits of calcium and Vitamin D for preventing tooth loss in seniors to improved baby formulas. At the end of each, links are given to a person involved with the research and the responsible agency. Beyond the initial page that has the current offerings, the index leads to the quarterly listing and text of briefs from 1995 to date. Serving as a true gateway, this is a rich resource for answering all sorts of questions about food safety. There are sections on news and safety alerts, consumer advice, national food safety programs, items of interest to children and teachers, videos, assistance for industry, and if these do not meet one's needs, a search and site index. Here are found the latest FDA actions on bioterrorism legislation as well as foodborne disease fact sheets, either a general overview or specific ones such as the one describing E. coli infection.",

Links to international resources and the full text of publications such as ''High Blood Pressure Fact Sheet'' are offered. A free paper copy of the atlas can be ordered here. It is hard not to get excited about the wealth of information available here. For instance, there is a scanned copy of a 1931 document related to converting nitrogen into proteins as well as a link to the more recent USDA classic, Nutritive Value of Foods for 2002. Major datasets offering chart and data formats as well as documentation cover such topics as retention factors for 16 vitamins and other substances after cooking, the oxalic acid content of selected vegetables, and the trans fatty acids content of 214 foods. This offers a calm and authoritative voice in the recent storm over current medical research and treatment related to hormone therapy for women. Included is the latest statement from the National Institutes of Health on the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study, press releases on ovarian cancer risk, a report from a 2002 scientific workshop, and information on alternative remedies such as black cohosh. Other sections are devoted to osteoporosis, breast cancer risks, and menopause in general.",

Links to related sites list many comparable government groups in several countries. Although an estimated 6 million men suffer from depression, they are much less likely to acknowledge and seek treatment for this disease than women are. This very comprehensive site is part of a national information campaign seeking to remedy that situation. It is structured around the real-life stories of a cross section of men. Connected to and skillfully interwoven with these narratives are full-text publications; advice for families and friends; clinical trials; and resources for help, both long term and in an immediate crisis situation. This is a description, requested by Congress of the Defense Department's controversial Total Information Awareness Program, now renamed the Terrorist Awareness Information Program (TIA). The purpose of the TIA would be to combine information technologies to aid in the detection of terrorists. The report describes the components of this system, and discusses how the programs can sift through mountains of information and differentiate terrorist activity from similar-but-lawful activity and also from deliberate misinformation.
