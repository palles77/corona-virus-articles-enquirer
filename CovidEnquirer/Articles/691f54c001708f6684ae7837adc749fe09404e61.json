While the 9 great majority of occurrences of the \"Programmed -1 Ribosomal Frameshifting\" (-1 10 PRF) involve viruses 2 , other mobile elements or retroelements 1 , a dramatic instance of 11 utilized human cellular -1 frameshifting in a non-retroelement derived mRNA has been 12 reported. The mRNA for which -1 frameshifting was claimed due to a stimulatory 13 pseudoknot is that which encodes immune functioning C-C chemokine receptor 5 14 (CCR5), the HIV-1 co-receptor 3 . The publication ascribed the importance of the reporter 15 CCR5 mRNA frameshifting directing translating ribosomes to a premature termination 16 codon leading to mRNA destabilization via the nonsense-mediated decay pathway 17 (NMD), rather than creating a C-terminally unique peptide. The same lab estimates that 18 up to 10% of eukaryotic genes may be regulated by this frameshift-NMD mechanism 4 19 and point to the potential for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at treating disease by -1 20 PRF 5 . Efficient -1 frameshifting requires a slippery site together with an appropriately 23 positioned stimulatory RNA structure. The reported CCR5 slip site (U_UUA_AAA where 24 underscores set of the reading frame) has previously been shown to facilitate high 25 levels of -1 frameshifting in vitro when positioned 5' of a known stimulatory pseudoknot 6 . 26 However, frameshifting efficiencies in vivo could be substantially different and further, at 27 least as of 2016, there were no known virus frameshift sites with the reported CCR5 28 shift site 1 . 29 30 We challenge the reported results by showing that frameshifting at the relevant 31 CCR5 sequence cassette does not occur above background levels and that the claimed 32 pertinent sequence is not as distinctively conserved as previously presented. Lastly, we 33 demonstrate that previously published retroelement derived human frameshift signals 34 do indeed harbor frameshift activity. 35 36",

The publication on CCR5 frameshifting utilized the very first iteration 70 of a dual luciferase vector that we developed in 1998 8 . 71 72 We recloned the same CCR5 frameshift sequence tested in the original article 73 into pSGDlucV3.0. For CCR5 we used negative controls comparable to those in the 74 original article, which include a slip site mutant (UUUAAAA \uf0e0 GCGCGCG for Y.A.K., 75 UUUAAAA \uf0e0 AUUCAAA for G.L.), a 5`-termination control (also known as a premature 76 termination codon control or PTC control) and a 3`-termination control (also known as 77 an out-of-frame stop codon control or OOF control). Lastly, we included measurements 78 from the empty vector alone (Figure 3C). All four of these controls are meant to 79 establish a baseline for background levels of luminescence 80 81 The dual luciferase assays were carried out in the same cell line used in the 82 original article, HeLa. Renilla luciferase, the reference luciferase, is stable for all the 83 constructs (Figure 4A). Similarly Firefly luciferase activities for the in-frame controls of 84 CCR5 and a HIV-1 control are consistent as well, indicating that when forced to express 85 Firefly luciferase, both constructs produce proteins with similar activity. The Firefly 86 luciferase activity for the WT HIV-1 frameshift construct is >40 fold higher than that of 87 WT CCR5 or any of its negative controls.

However, CCR5 WT frameshifting is 93 ~0.15%, indistinguishable from its negative controls, indicating that CCR5 does not 94 frameshift above background at our limit of sensitivity and is certainly far less than the 95 previously reported level of 9-11% 3 . In fact, CCR5 SSM demonstrates slightly higher 96 rates of FS than the WT, indicating that translational recoding values this low are 97 indicative of background ( Figure 4C) .

Additionally, a lack of 123 statistically significant purifying selection acting on the slip site (a hallmark for 124 functionally relevant frameshift signals) supports the argument that CCR5 does not 125 contain a biologically important frameshift signal. There are several possible 126 explanations for the discrepancy between the reported CCR5 results and the results 127 presented here but the most obvious one is the standard decoding of a significant 128 percentage of mRNAs generated by cryptic splicing. Methods 133 Alignment of CCR5 slippery sites 134 The NCBI mRNA and RefSeq BLAST databases were searched with blastn using the 135 human CCR5 mRNA (accession NM_000579.3) as query on December 4th, 2018 using 136 default parameters, with the number of hits expanded from 100 to 500. The best 137 sequence per organism, as determined by 'Max Score', was taken up until 70% query 138 cover. These sequences were aligned with MUSCLE. This alignment was trimmed to 139 only include the putative frameshift region of CCR5 that was generated by code written 140 in Python 3. The alignment image was generated using the box-shade server 141 (https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/BOX_form.html). 142 143 CCR5 Primate CDS analysis 144 Of the sequences obtained in the ortholog search, only those belonging to the 145 taxonomic descriptor of 'primate' (taxid 9443) were used. Lemur catta sequences were 146 ignored, since the original manuscript states that the CCR5 frameshift signal is not 147 conserved in Lemur catta. All CDS sequences were aligned with MUSCLE and then 148 either at single nucleotide resolution or a smoothed 10 nucleotide window plotted in 149 Python 3. doi: bioRxiv preprint pSGDlucV3.0 was generated by introducing silent mutations into the Renilla coding 153 sequence to disrupt two potential donor splice sites (TGGgtaagt). 154 For Figures 4 and 6 (Y.A.K.) the vector was digested with PspXI and Bgl-II.
