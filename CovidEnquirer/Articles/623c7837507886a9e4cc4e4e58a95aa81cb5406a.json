            "text": "Background: Understanding viral etiology and age-specific incidence of acute respiratory infections in infants can help identify risk groups and inform vaccine delivery, but community-based data is lacking from tropical settings. Methods: One thousand four hundred and seventy-eight infants in urban Ho Chi Minh City and 981 infants in a semi-rural district in southern Vietnam were enrolled at birth and followed to 1 year of age. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes were identified through clinic-based illness surveillance, hospital admissions and self-reports. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from infants with respiratory symptoms and tested for 14 respiratory pathogens using multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: Estimated incidence of ARI was 542 and 2691 per 1000 infant-years, and hospitalization rates for ARI were 81 and 138 per 1000 infant-years, in urban and semi-rural cohorts, respectively, from clinic-and hospital-based surveillance. However self-reported ARI episodes were just 1.5-fold higher in the semi-rural versus urban cohort, indicating that part of the urban-rural difference was explained by under-ascertainment in the urban cohort. Incidence was higher in infants \u22656 months of age than <6 months, but this was pathogen-specific. One or more viruses were detected in 53% (urban) and 64% (semi-rural) of samples from outpatients with ARI and in 78% and 66% of samples from hospitalized ARI patients, respectively. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus A and bocavirus. ARI-associated hospitalizations were associated with longer stays and more frequent ICU admission than other infections. Conclusions: ARI is a significant cause of morbidity in Vietnamese infants and influenza virus A is an under-appreciated cause of vaccine-preventable disease and hospitalizations in this tropical setting. Public health strategies to reduce infant ARI incidence and hospitalization rates are needed.",

Finally, bacterial pathogens are known to be contributors to ARI in young children 36,37 but were not investigated in this study due to logistical and financial constraints.",

An estimated 1.9 million children die from ARI worldwide annually, 70% of them in Africa and Southeast Asia. 1 Studies to define the incidence, age-distribution and etiology of respiratory infections in children can help to identify risk groups and to understand the potential impact of current and future vaccines. Although there exists a large hospital-based literature, [2] [3] [4] [5] including studies from Vietnam, 6, 7 there are limited data on the epidemiology and etiology of ARI from community-based studies, particularly in low income settings. [8] [9] [10] [11] Population-based studies of respiratory syncytial virus infection 9, 12 and influenza 13 have demonstrated a substantial burden of disease, including severe disease, in an outpatient setting that would be missed by hospital-based studies. Longitudinal community-based cohort studies have the benefit of capturing this full clinical spectrum, as well as permitting estimates of incidence, detection of repeated infections and identification of risk factors for infection and disease. However, many previous studies have been limited because they were hospital-based, cross-sectional, small in size, did not include year-round case detection, or focused only on the detection of a specific pathogen.",

We therefore calculated ARI incidence stratified by age group (\u22646 or >6 months) and calendar quarter, overall and for the 6 most common pathogens. A weighted ARI incidence estimate for all-cause ARI was calculated by combining the stratum-specific estimates, weighted by stratum-specific observation times. Weighted pathogen-specific incidence estimates could not be calculated because the total number of infections for most viruses was too small to stratify by study site as well as age-group and season, and it was not informative to combine 2 sites with such different ARI incidences.",

Rhinovirus was the predominant virus detected both in infants admitted to hospital and those seen as outpatients, where it accounted for more than half of the PCR-positive samples. RSV, bocavirus, influenza virus A, coronavirus and parainfluenzavirus 3 (predominantly in inpatients) were the next most commonly detected viruses, which broadly reflects the etiological patterns reported from other settings. 7, 8, [24] [25] [26] [27] We extrapolated from the subset of respiratory specimens tested by PCR, to infer virus-specific minimum incidence rates in the first year of life for the predominant pathogens. These estimates are subject to the limitation of case ascertainment, discussed further below, which partly explains the differences between study sites and means that these will be underestimates of the true virusspecific incidence. This extrapolation furthermore assumes a similar pathogen distribution among the ARI episodes from which no specimen was available [293/2885 (10%) of outpatient ARI and 172/236 (73%) of inpatient ARI episodes] as among those specimens tested. An interaction between the time-varying age-distribution of infants under observation and the seasonality of the viruses could conceivably have biased these estimates in either direction, but we were not able to weight the incidence estimates to adjust for this due to very small counts of pathogen-specific infections in many strata when stratifying by study site, inpatient/outpatient, age group and calendar quarter. Nonetheless, these data illustrate the high rates of respiratory virus infection experienced by infants during their first year of life, especially in the semi-rural cohort. The estimated incidence of influenza virus-associated ARI in our Dong Thap cohort is very similar to an infant cohort in rural India 8 where cases were actively detected through household visits, and 1.5-to threefold higher than reported from a clinic-based study in the US. 12 Our estimates of RSV-associated ARI hospitalizations in the semi-rural cohort are also very similar to those from a community-based cohort in Kenya 9 and a clinic-based study in the US, 12 although the overall incidence of RSV in our study was substantially lower than reported from the Kenyan cohort or the rural Indian cohort.",

There are however some limitations. First, our ascertainment of acute illness episodes was passive and consequently incomplete, particularly in HCMC, as compared with self-reported episodes or with hospital admission records. This is likely due to the abundance of health care providers in the city that families might use in preference to our study clinic. As a result, it is highly likely that the incidence of ARI in the HCMC cohort was considerably underestimated. The ARI incidence in our semi-rural cohort was also somewhat lower that has been reported in other studies where active case detection was employed, 10 indicating that our passive clinic-based case detection might have resulted in some under-ascertainment also in the semi-rural cohort. Second, the study population was drawn from women delivering at one large hospital in each study site, who may not constitute a representative cross-section of the catchment population.
