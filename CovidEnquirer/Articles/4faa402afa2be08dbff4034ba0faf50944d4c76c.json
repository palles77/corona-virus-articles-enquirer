This implies that technological developments need to be directed towards correct treatment at the right place and at the right time.

In order to control a possible SARS outbreak, there is the need to be prepared. The development of a rapid and decisive surveillance system is paramount, and the keys to the successful implementation of such a system are upto-date information on local, national, and global SARS activity and effective communication among local and international healthcare workers using web technologies (WHO, 2003a ).",

High throughput data methods yield insights into the functions of cells, but limitations still exist in the information content they deliver.

As the control loops exist and do not have to be designed from scratch, the next step will be to modify them to achieve properly designed drugs to cure illnesses (Kitano, 2004) and increase cell productivity (Kauffman et al., 2002) by proper disturbances.",
