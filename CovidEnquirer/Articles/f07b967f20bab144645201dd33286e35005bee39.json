This study aimed to evaluate compliance with standard precautions by analysis of the incidence and systems sources of such contaminations and by quantifying the use of personal protective equipment. Method: A prospective observational study from 1 November 2005 to 30 April 2006, using analysis of video segments. Videotapes were recorded in two rooms designed for cardiopulmonary resuscitation of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, and compliance with basic infection control measures by all emergency department crews was monitored. Results: A total of 44 consecutive performances of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were recorded for time-motion analysis. The percentages of staff wearing personal protective equipment were 90%, 50%, 20% and 75% for masks, eye protection, gowns and gloves, respectively.",

The two leading systems sources for contamination were lack of specific task assignments among rescuers (44%) and inadequate preparation for procedures (42%). Conclusions: Among healthcare workers in the emergency setting, the study disclosed suboptimal compliance with basic infection control measures, including use of personal protective equipment and avoiding contamination. By further time-motion analysis of resuscitation sessions, major systems sources and strategies for improvement could be identified.",

For example, if a staff member performing chest compressions moved on to record on the chart or retrieve medications from the trolley, contamination was registered. The other common source was inadequate preparation for procedures (42%), indicating that equipment for a specific task was not prepared and assembled beforehand so that the staff had to move back and forth between the clean and contaminated zones.

First, although standard precautions have been promoted for two decades, compliance with PPE use remained unsatisfactory among HCWs during resuscitation. Second, contamination events occurred frequently among the rescuers, particularly among nursing staff. Third, time-motion analysis revealed the above two major systems sources leading to over 80% of contamination events. This was a first attempt to study compliance with PPE use and the frequency and systems sources of contamination in a working ED. In view of the disproportionate loss of HCWs during the SARS epidemic in 2003, the dismal performance we observed is very alarming. Infection control techniques should be more stringently followed by HCWs in emergency healthcare settings, particularly when confronting potential epidemics of emerging infectious diseases, such as avian flu. In the 1980s, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) published guidelines urging the use of 'universal precautions', [16] [17] [18] based on the findings that HCWs could not promptly identify most patients infected with contagious disease at initial presentation. Current concepts of infection control have evolved from universal precautions to detailed recommendations. 'Standard precautions' emphasise the potential mode and route of transmission, applying to all patients at all times; 'specific precautions' refer to patients with documented or suspected colonisation and infection with specific microorganisms. 19, 20 Facing threats of tuberculosis, SARS, avian flu and other emerging infectious diseases, these recommendations remain valuable today. In fact, standard precautions involving use of simple PPE, including gloves, gowns, masks and eye protection, are effective in preventing serious contagious disease. 6, 21 Lessons from the SARS epidemic indicated that poor compliance with the use of PPE, 2,21-23 and direct contact with a patient or an environment contaminated by respiratory droplets significantly increased the risk among HCWs of contracting SARS. 2, 13, 24, 25 Although there was compelling evidence that failure to implement appropriate barrier precautions is responsible for most nosocomial transmissions, 26 research that is focused on compliance with standard precautions is limited. Henry et al. 27 reported that standard precautions were not consistently used by ED personnel, who significantly overestimated their own compliance. Using bystander observations and a self-administered questionnaire, Henry found that gloves were the barrier device worn most frequently when appropriate (74%), followed by goggles (13%), gowns (12%) and masks (1%). In contrast, compliance with use of PPE was highest for masks (overall 90%) in our study. This is probably due to experience of the SARS outbreak. Caputo et al. 28 reported that HCWs' awareness of PPE use increased significantly during the SARS outbreak, but ebbed with time, agreeing with the unsatisfactory compliance noted in our observations. Use of PPE increased when the equipment was readily accessible to the rescuer. For example, gowns were used less often in our study because they were located outside the resuscitation room.",

            "text": "The ED has a high potential for propagating communicable disease through cross-contamination in a busy and crowded environment. During the SARS outbreak, Chen and colleagues 23 identified positive SARS coronavirus RNA in 9 of 119 samples from inanimate objects in the ED. Risk of transmission increased as more contamination events occurred. In the present study, rates of contamination (events/personmin) were higher among the nursing staff (10.13 \u00d7 10 \u22122 for trolleys and 1.56 \u00d7 10 \u22122 for charts). This meant that during a resuscitation session with five nurses for 20 min, approximately 10 contamination events occurred involving the trolleys and one to two involving the charts. Contamination events were recorded with greater frequency among nursing staff because of the character of their tasks and because they were responsible for executing and charting oral orders given by physicians during resuscitation. In addition to personal awareness of standard precautions, a detailed analysis of the systems and environmental sources leading to contamination events is essential for formulating education and prevention strategies. In our study, over 80% of contamination events could have been avoided if two systems changes had been implemented, namely specific task assignment for rescuers and better preparation before performing invasive procedures. Other measures such as better spatial and personnel arrangement in the resuscitation room and clearer demarcation between clean and contaminated zones would also help reduce contamination.",

            "text": "There were some limitations to this study. First, the Hawthorne effect was inevitable in the video recording, time-motion analysis research. However, if the compliance was poor while under observation, it was probably worse at other times. Second, as there was no outbreak of transmissible disease, the direct biological effect of suboptimal PPE use and contamination could not be established. Although there is little evidence documenting disease transmission between rescuers and patients during resuscitation, 1,3,26,29 the high infection rates among HCWs during the SARS epidemic would suggest that this is significant. Adherence to standard precautions and avoidance of contamination during daily practice remain the best protection from the spread of contagious diseases.",
