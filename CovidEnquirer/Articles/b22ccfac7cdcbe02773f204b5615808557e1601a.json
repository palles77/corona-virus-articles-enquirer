We investigated how alterations in spike affect neurovirulence using two isogenic recombinant viruses differing exclusively in spike. S 4 R, containing the MHV-4 spike gene, is dramatically more neurovirulent than S A59 R, containing the MHV-A59 spike gene (J. J. Phillips, M. M. Chua, E. Lavi, and S. R. Weiss, 1999, J. Virol. 73, 7752-7760). We examined the contribution of differences in cellular tropism, viral spread, and the immune response to infection to the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R. MHV-4 spike-mediated neurovirulence was associated with extensive viral spread in the brain in both neurons and astrocytes. Infection of primary hippocampal neuron cultures demonstrated that S 4 R spread more rapidly than S A59 R and suggested that spread may occur between cells in close physical contact. In addition, S 4 R infection induced a massive influx of lymphocytes into the brain, a higher percentage of CD8 \u03e9 T cells, and a higher frequency of MHV-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cells relative S A59 R infection. Despite this robust and viral-specific immune response to S 4 R infection, infection of RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice suggested that immune-mediated pathology also contributes to the high neurovirulence of S 4 R.",

We have previously demonstrated that the spike (S) gene is a major determinant of MHV neurovirulence. Recombinant viruses containing the spike gene of the highly neurovirulent MHV-4 strain, S 4 R, exhibit a dramatically more neurovirulent phenotype (3 log 10 decrease in intracranial LD 50 ) than isogenic recombinants containing the spike gene of the mildly neurovirulent MHV-A59 strain, S A59 R (Phillips et al., 1999) . (S A59 R and S 4 R have all other genes derived from MHV-A59.) By defining the contribution of direct virus-mediated pathology and immune-mediated pathology to the differential neurovirulence of S 4 R and S A59 R, we can better elucidate the mechanisms by which the MHV-4 spike confers high neurovirulence.",

S 4 R and S A59 R infection of neurons was confirmed by cell morphology and by double-immunostaining for viral antigen and MAP2 (Fig. 3 ). Viral antigenpositive cells were often located in discrete foci. Moreover, viral antigen-positive neurites could often be observed between infected cells or between foci of infected cells, suggesting that perhaps one means of viral spread in these cultures was along neurites. To examine the pattern of viral spread in these cultures, we determined the total number of viral antigen-positive cells and the total number of foci of infected cells per coverslip at different time points (Table 2) . On day 1 postinfection the average number of foci and the total number of antigenpositive cells was similar following infection with S 4 R and S A59 R. On day 3 postinfection, although the average number of foci was similar, the average number of viral antigen-positive cells was significantly greater following infection with S 4 R than S A59 R (two-tailed t test, P \u03fd 0.01). Thus, on day 3 the number of viral antigen-positive cells per focus was greater for S 4 R, 5.79 \u03ee 1.15, than S A59 R, 3.17 \u03ee 1.59 (mean \u03ee SD). The difference in the number of infected cells, despite a similar number of foci, between S 4 R and S A59 R, suggested that S 4 R spread faster via cell-cell spread than S A59 R. Thus, the results in primary neuronal cultures were consistent with the results in vivo and suggested that the MHV-4 spike conferred an inherent ability to spread rapidly from cell to cell in the CNS.",

The MHV-A59 spike lacks the immunodominant S510 epitope (Luytjes et al., 1987) . Thus, following infection with S A59 R the MHV-specific CD8 \u03e9 T cell response was S598-specific and accounted for approximately 11.8% of the CD8 \u03e9 T cell response.",

The reason for this background level of IFN-\u2425 expression is not known; however, it has been suggested that infected microglia and macrophages in the CNS cell preparation may stimulate CD4 \u03e9 T cells (Haring et al., 2001) . The frequency of M133-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells following infection with S 4 R or S A59 R was similar, accounting for approximately 16.0 and 15.4% of the CD4 \u03e9 T cell response, respectively. As this may overestimate the frequency of MHV-specific cells in the CNS, we also subtracted the percentage of IFN-\u2425-expressing cells in the absence of peptide from the total percentage of IFN-\u2425-expressing cells after peptide stimulation. The calculated frequency of M133-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells following infection with S 4 R, 10.6%, and S A59 R, 8.9%, was also similar. Thus, infection with either S 4 R or S A59 R resulted in a robust CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cell response that was both epitope-specific and functional. The major difference between the frequency of virusspecific T cells induced by S 4 R and S A59 R was the increased frequency of functionally activated CD8 \u03e9 T cells following infection with the more neurovirulent S 4 R. Note that due to the increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the brain following S 4 R infection relative to S A59 R infection, the total number of virus-specific CD8 \u03e9 and CD4 \u03e9 T cells in the brain was greater following infection with S 4 R than S A59 R.",

In contrast, RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea mice infected with S 4 R exhibited prolonged survival relative to immunocompetent B6 mice: the median survival time for S 4 R-infected mice was 13 days in RAG1\u03ea/\u03ea and 10 days in B6 mice (statistically different, Mann-Whitney rank sum test, P \u03fd 0.0001) (Fig. 6B) .

The response to the S510 epitope in the S 4 R spike may at least partially account for this increase in the frequency of CD8 \u03e9 T cells. Interestingly, mutations in the S510 epitope in a related MHV-JHM strain have been associated with alterations in neuropathogenesis (Pewe et al., 1998) . However there are other factors that may contribute. For example, quantitative differences in antigen presentation or differences in the ability of immune cells to traffic to and proliferate in the CNS following infection with S 4 R and S A59 R may contribute to differences in the percentage of CD8 \u03e9 T cells and to the overall magnitude of the antiviral immune response. Furthermore the percentage of total CD8 \u03e9 T cells among CNS lymphocytes (Fig. 4) may include CD8 \u03e9 cells specific for epitopes other than S510 and S598, perhaps host epitopes.

Despite prolonged replication of infectious S 4 R in the CNS of RAG\u03ea/\u03ea mice, these mice exhibited prolonged survival relative to immunocompetent mice. In contrast, the T and B cell response to S A59 R infection was primarily protective. These data suggest that immunemediated pathology contributes to the high neurovirulence of S 4 R. Interestingly, previous studies with MHV have also suggested that, in addition to its role in pro-tection, the inflammatory response, particularly the T cell response, can be immunopathologic. Prolonged survival of perforin-deficient mice infected with a JHM strain of virus suggested that CD8 \u03e9 CTLs might contribute to disease (Lin et al., 1997) . Moreover, CD4 \u03e9 T cells have also been implicated in immunopathology; both adoptive transfer experiments with CD4 \u03e9 T cells and infection of CD4 \u03e9 knockout mice have suggested that CD4 \u03e9 T cells in the CNS may increase disease morbidity (Lane et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2000) . To determine whether CD8 \u03e9 or CD4 \u03e9 T cells were primarily responsible for the prolonged survival in RAG\u03ea/\u03ea mice, we compared the survival of CD8\u03ea/\u03ea, CD4\u03ea/\u03ea, and immunocompetent B6 mice infected with S 4 R; however, the absence of either T cell subset alone did not confer significantly increased survival (data not shown).",

Our results suggest that MHVinduced immunopathology is also complex and involves multiple components of the immune response to infection. Studies with LCMV and HIV have suggested that virus strains that exhibit rapid viral spread are associated with increased immune-mediated pathology (Wodarz and Krakauer, 2000; Moskophidis et al., 1995) .

For flow cytometry approximately 1 \u03eb 10 6 cells were washed three times with PBS 1% BSA and blocked with 50 g of rat IgG and a 1:200 dilution of anti-CD16/CD32 (Fc\u2425III/II receptor, clone 2.4G2). Cells were then surface stained for the appropriate markers for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS 1% BSA, and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Cells were analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). The total number of cells positive for each marker per mouse was determined by multiplying the fraction of cells positive for the marker by the total number of live cells isolated per brain. As controls, monocytes were incubated with isotype controls and monocytes from the brains of mock-infected mice were incubated with antibodies to cell markers.",
