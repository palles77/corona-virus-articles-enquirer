The dyspnea increased despite treatment, and he was transferred to the Department of Pediatrics at the Asan Medical Center for further management. On arrival, he was apyrexial and tachypneic (respiratory rate, 66/min). Mild subcostal retraction was observed, and coarse breath sounds without crackles were noted on auscultation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) showed mild hypoxemia. His white blood cell (WBC) count was 14,300/ \u03bcL, with 55.8% neutrophils and 36.3% lymphocytes. Radiography and computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed the presence of fine peribronchial ground-glass opacities in both lungs ( Fig. 1A and 1B) . Blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and sputum cultures were negative for bacteria, viruses, and fungi. A lung biopsy performed on day 3 of admission showed the organizing phase of DAD distributed mainly in the centrilobular area, with destruction and obliteration of bronchioles by fibroblasts (Fig. 1E ). The patient was administered intravenous corticosteroids (2 mg/kg/day), followed by oral prednisolone (which was gradually tapered), hydroxychloroquine, and oral cyclophosphamide. His condition gradually improved, although exercise intolerance persisted. At the 1-year follow-up, a repeat CT scan of the chest revealed a decrease in the extent of ground-glass opacities in the affected areas of both lungs ( Fig. 1C and 1D ).",

Chest radiography showed diffuse hazy patches in the left lung, and a chest CT scan revealed the presence of multifocal consolidation and diffuse centrinodular ground-glass opacities in both lungs. Laboratory findings included a normal WBC count, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 42 mm/hr, an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 5.19 mg/dL, and a normal ABGA. Laboratory tests for collagen disease and vasculitis were negative. Blood, sputum, and BAL fluid cultures were negative for bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Lung biopsy, performed on day 11 of admission, showed histological features of fibroproliferative DAD with diffuse interstitial fibrosis and relative sparing of the peripheral lobular air spaces. The patient required mechanical ventilation for a total of 36 days. He was administered broad-spectrum antibiotics and high-dose corticosteroids. On discharge, he still experienced dyspnea on exertion and required intermittent oxygen at night and on exertion. At the 1-year follow-up, radiography and a CT scan revealed a decrease in the degree of bronchial dilatation and peribronchial consolidation; the patient still complained of dyspnea on exertion.",

Four weeks prior to admission, she had developed a mild cough, and her oral intake had become poor. Four days prior to admission, she had developed sudden onset dyspnea and subcutaneous emphysema. On admission, she presented with marked tachypnea (respiratory rate, 80/min) and chest retraction, and rales were audible in both lungs on auscultation. Radiography and a CT scan of the chest showed an extensive pneumomediastinum, a pneumothorax in the right hemithorax, and diffuse ground-glass opacities with consolidation in both lungs ( Fig. 2A and 2B ). Her total leukocyte count was 9,300/\u03bcL, with 66% neutrophils and 27% lymphocytes. Blood, sputum, and BAL cultures for bacteria and fungi were negative. Multiplex RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates revealed the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). She was admitted to the intensive care unit and treated with steroids, cyclophosphamide, hydroxychloroquine, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her response to treatment was poor, and her condition deteriorated rapidly. On the third day of admission, mechanical ventilation was required for impending respiratory failure. Repeated chest radiography revealed the presence of increased opacities in both lungs (Fig. 2C ). She then developed refractory hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure with subsequent multiorgan dysfunction. Despite the administration of antifibrotics and supportive therapy, she died 70 days after admission. A postmortem lung biopsy revealed the features of the fibrotic phase of DAD with occasional hyaline membrane and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (Fig. 2D ).",

On physical examination, she was apyrexial and tachypneic (respiratory rate, 44/ min), and crackles were audible over the right lung on auscultation. No hypoxemia was detected by ABGA. Her leukocyte count was 14,000/\u03bcL, with 72% neutrophils and 20% lymphocytes. The ESR was 38 mm/hr; and the CRP was 1.92 mg/dL. Laboratory tests for collagen vascular disease and vasculitis were negative. Blood, sputum, and BAL fluid cultures were negative for bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Pulmonary function tests showed a mild restrictive defect. Radiography and a CT scan of the chest revealed the presence of multifocal patchy consolidation with ground-glass opacities and tiny nodular lesions in both lungs. The patient was treated with steroid pulse therapy, followed by oral steroids, azathioprine, and antibiotics. The dyspnea gradually decreased, and she was discharged after 2 weeks of treatment. A repeat CT scan of the chest 12 days postdischarge showed an increase in the extent of ground-glass opacities and tiny nodules in both lungs. She was readmitted 14 days post-discharge with increased dyspnea. Cyclosporine was added to her existing treatment regimen of steroids and azathioprine. Transbronchial biopsy showed a nonspecific subacute lung injury pattern, including focal-organizing pneumonia and mild interstitial chronic inflammation. A follow-up chest CT scan 4 weeks after readmission revealed mild resolution of the abnormalities in both lungs. After discharge, her daily activities were limited by dyspnea, and she continued to experience dyspnea at rest.",

Although genetic susceptibility cannot be ruled out in these familial cases, the simultaneous development of interstitial pneumonia implies the involvement of exposure to common environmental factors or the presence of infection in each family member. Because all family members reside in an urban region with no history of contact with animals or dust, it is suggested that interstitial pneumonia may be associated with viral infections; however, more investigation is needed in the future. A nationwide pediatric surveillance study performed in 2006 and then again in 2008 demonstrated a geographical and seasonal pattern to the increased incidence of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis in Korea. 3 Between February and June in both 2006 and 2008, an increase in the incidence of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis was initially observed in the southern regions of the country, and this progressed gradually toward the northern regions. 2, 5 The spring timing of this interstitial pneumonia, its characteristic pattern of spread from the south to north, and the detection of various viruses (i.e., human corona virus, cytomegalovirus, and parainfluenza virus), when considered together with the findings of the present familial case series, provide evidence that viral infection may be associated with the development of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis in Korea. Altered or exaggerated host defense mechanisms, or repair processes triggered by a viral infection, may be responsible for the lung damage and fibrosis observed in these patients.",

In addition, the presence of a pneumothorax and/or a pneumomediastinum on chest radiography (case 3) and the severity of the respiratory difficulty, both reflecting disease severity, may predict poor response to treatment.",

The occurrence of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis only in spring and its familial pattern suggest that the development of this disease may be related to exposure to viruses or to common inhaled environmental agents. Further studies are needed to better understand the etiology and pathophysiology of unclassified interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis. As this disease has a poor prognosis, early diagnosis with lung biopsy and radiological examination, and early initiation of immunosuppressive therapy are critical for improving the outcome.",
