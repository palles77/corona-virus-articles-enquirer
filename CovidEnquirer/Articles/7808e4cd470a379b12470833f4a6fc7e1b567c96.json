Up to now, the virus has caused ASF outbreaks in 51 more than fifty countries in Africa, Europe, Asia, and South America 4 . 52 The latest reports showed that the virus has caused outbreaks in more 53 than fifteen provinces in China 7,8 . Because of the high lethality of ASFV 54 in domestic pigs, the most commonly used strategies to control the virus 55 were the massive culling campaigns and the restriction of pig movement 5 . 56 Both strategies have resulted in a huge economic loss for pig industry and 57 affected people's livelihoods. Unfortunately, currently there is no 58 available effective vaccine against ASFVs. 59 60 Many efforts have been devoted to developing the vaccine for the ASFV 61 1,5,9-11 , however, most of these attempts failed. One of the most important 62 reasons was the complex composition of the antigenic proteins 5,12 . 63 Previous reports showed that p72, p30, and p54 were the three important 64 antigenic proteins during the infection of ASFVs, but the immunity 65 against them could only provide a partial protection 12, 13 .

Besides, 129 the size of indels in both ends was also much larger than that in the 130 middle region.

A total of 252 protein groups plus 28 singletons were 160 obtained (Table S3), each of which stood for one type of protein encoded 161 by ASFV genomes. The obtained proteins contained almost all the 162 proteins identified in previous experiments(Table S3). , and were mainly encoded by both plus and minus strands in the 166 middle regions(Figure 2). The protein groups could be further separated 167 into seven classes by function based on previous studies(Figures 2 & S3).168    Only about 30% of protein groups were observed to have the known169 functions, including replication and transcription (in red), host cell 170 interactions (in magenta), structure and morphogenesis (in blue), and 171 enzymes (in yellow). Most of the above-described protein groups with the 172 known functions belonged to the core proteins of the virus. In addition, 173 forty protein groups belonged to \"Multigene Families (MGF)\" (in cyan), 174 most of which had unknown functions. The MGFs were encoded by both 175 ends of the genome. Besides, the remaining 146 protein groups belonged 176 to either the class of \"Proteins with unknown function\" (in gray) the protein conservation showed that except the functional 180 class of MGFs, the proteins in other functional classes had an average of 181 pairwise sequence identities greater than 90% (Figure S4).

According to the results 236 in previous studies, three factors may contribute to the extensive indels in 237 ASFVs: replication slippage, retrotransposition and recombination 23 . 238 Replication slippage mainly produced duplications of short genetic 239 sequences and may cause short indels, but it is unlikely to generate we investigated the role of recombination in the generation of 249 indels in the ASFV genomes. The analyses on the recombination showed 250 that there were a total of 103 recombination events, and each ASFV 251 genome had 3-22 recombination events (Figure 3 & Table S5). The virus 252 isolate SouthAfrica79 experienced the largest number of recombination 253 events. On average, each virus experienced 11 recombination events.

In total, 256 the regions in the ASFV genomes involved in all recombination events 257 covered a total of 101,569 nucleotide positions, accounting for 47% of 258 the aligned genome. Most recombination events happened at both ends, 259 especially at the 5' end. Interestingly, the recombination event in the 260 aligned genomes was observed to be consistent with the ratio of the gap 261 in the genome (the bottom of Figure 3). Almost all the much larger than those in other regions (Figure S7). Further 265 comparison of the number of indels in the recombination regions and 266 other regions showed that for indels of varing length, such as those 267 greater than 5, 10, or 50 bp, the number of indels in the recombination 268 regions was much larger than those in other regions (",

The protein 323 pD345L has 345 amino acids and is encoded by the minus strand. topoisomerase was also reported to be related to homologous 334 recombination.

Interestingly, the average distance 358 decreased as the size of the elements increased from 11 to 23; it reached 359 to the minimum (136 bp) when the size was 23; then the distance kept 360 unchanged as the size increased from 23 to 46; finally, it increased as the 361 size of repeated element increased from 47 to 100.

For clarity, the natural logarithm systematically analyzed the genetic diversity of ASFVs. , this mechanism could facilitate the precise regulation of the 409 viral activities. For example, the ASFV virus was considered to contain 410all the enzymes and factors which were required for the transcription which may be caused by the following two reasons: i) over 40% 415 of the proteins were non-essential among ASFVs, and ASFVs may have 416 variable number of these proteins; ii) there were 31 genes with 417 replications in ASFV genomes. Diverse proteome among ASFVs may 418 lead to diverse phenotype, such as the diversity in antigen and virulence.419    The diversity may result in a great challenge for the prevention and 420 control of the virus. For example, the viruses with diverse antigens 12 , unfortunately, most of the attempts have been unsuccessful.426    The failure could be caused by many factors 12 , including the absence of427 neutralizing antibodies, the diverse antigen-related proteins, the 428 complexity of neutralization, etc. In this study, a total of 65 membrane 429 proteins have been identified. Over eighty percent (80%) of the 430 membrane proteins had unknown functions, many of which may 431 contribute to the antigenic diversity of the virus. Previous studies showed 432 that immunized pigs with the baculovirus expressed hemagglutinin of 433 ASFV were protected against the viral lethal infection 28 . The results 434 suggested that incorporation of multiple antigens in the vaccine may 435 provide better protection. Therefore, much more efforts are needed to 436 determine the role of membrane proteins in stimulating found to have larger contribution to the genetic diversity of 441 ASFVs than the point mutations. Compared to point mutations, indels 442 could introduce a larger variation to the genome, and cause a more influenza viruses and hepatitis B viruses (HBV). However, it was 446 more robust for the indels to occur inside the viruses with large genomes, 447 such as ASFVs and poxviruses 3,29 , because the viruses with large 448 genomes had lots of repeated elements and duplicated proteins (paralogs). 449 Moreover, indels may provide a more efficient way of survival than the 450 point mutations under the natural selection pressure, since the virus with 451 indels could rapidly change its phenotype 3,29 , such as antigen, virulence, 452 or ability of replication and transcription. For example, the deletion of 453 some MGF genes in ASFV could reduce the viral replication or virulence, 454 which may help with the viral infection of soft ticks 3could contribute to the indels and the gene duplications, 457 including replication slippage, retrotransposition, recombination, 458 aneuploidy, polyploidy, etc 31 . The replication slippage may introduce 459 short indels which were widely observed in ASFV genomes, but it is 460 unlikely to cause large indels. This study has demonstrated that the 461 ectopic homologous recombination 32 , during which the segments with 462 unequal length were exchanged (Figure 6A), may contribute much to the 463 extensive indels observed in ASFV genomes. As a proof, significant 464 associations were observed between the occurrence of roles in ASFVs. Taken together, the homologous 473 recombination should be the effective strategy of ASFVs to generate the 474 genetic diversity, which further leads to the diverse phenotypes, including 475 antigen, virulence, replication and transcription ability, and the \"Homologous recombination leads to (A) the indels, and (Bsome limitations to this study. Firstly, the number of ASFV 482 genomes was limited, which hindered a comprehensive analysis on the 483 evolution of ASFV genomes. Fortunately, the isolates included in this 484 study covered a long time period from 1950 to 2017, and also covered a 485 large area including Africa and Europe, which were the two major areas 486 of the ASFV circulation. Thus the results based on these isolates reflect 487 the genetic diversity of the ASFVs to a large extent. Secondly, the 488 location and size of the indels observed in ASFV genomes may be 489 affected by the sequence alignment algorithm. Two common methods for 490 the alignment of ASFV genomes were used in this study. In both methods, 491 frequent indels were observed, and the indels were demonstrated to be 492 more responsible for the genetic diversity than the point mutations. 493 Thirdly, the proteome of each ASFV was inferred by computational 494 methods. All of the obtained proteins had significant homology to the 495 proteins in the NCBI Protein database, however, most of the proteins in 496 the NCBI Protein database were only predicted without experimental 497 validations. Besides, functions of nearly 70% of ASFV proteins were 498 unknown. Further experimental studies were needed to determine the 499 proteome and the functions in ASFVs 14,15 . Lastly, the extensively 500 repeated elements in ASFV genomes could facilitate the this work provided a systematic view of the genetic diversity of 510 ASFVs. Extensive homologous recombination detected in this study may 511 contribute much to the widespread indels observed in ASFV genomes, 512 which further lead to the large genetic diversity of ASFVs. The results on 513 the causes of the diversity of ASFVs would help with the understanding 514 of the evolution of the virus and thus facilitate the prevention and derived from a patent, a total of 36 ASFV genomes 522 were kept in the analysis. The genomic sequences were aligned a Perl script: overlapping regions in the same coding frame 533 were merged to obtain open reading frames (ORFs) as long as possible; 534 regions without start codon or stop codon were extended upstream or 535 downstream to search for the start or stop codon. Then, the genomic 536regions which had i) significant hit, ii) both sequence identity and query 537 coverage percentage greater than 60%, iii) both start and stop codons, and 538 iv) over 120 bps, were defined as the candidate ORFs. The candidate539    ORFs were then translated into proteins using a Perl script. The proteins, 540 which were either completely embedded within another protein, or 541 contained less than 40 amino acids due to early termination of translation",

Besides, most of these studies either only investigated the genetic 84 diversity of some common genes, such as p72 and p54 18,19 , or only used 85 one or several isolate genomes 3,16,17 . The number of discovered viral 86 genomes has increased rapidly as the development of DNA sequencing 87 technology. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the genetic diversity of Homologous recombination, which has been reported to occur in several 91 groups of viruses 20-23 , such as herpesvirus, retroviruses, and 92 coronaviruses, has played an important role in viral evolution 21 . A few 93 studies on several ASFV genes have suggested the occurrence of 94 homologous recombination in the evolution of ASFVs 3,18 . However, a 95 comprehensive study on the homologous recombination in ASFV at the 96 genomic scale is lacking, and the role of the recombination on the genetic 97 diversity and the evolution of the virus is still unknown. In this study, we 98 have systematically investigated the genomic diversity and the 99 homologous recombination of ASFVs based on the analysis on all the 100 publicly available ASFV genomes. The results demonstrated that the 101 homologous recombination contributed much to the genetic diversity of 102 ASFVs.
