EIDs can be caused by: (i) microorganisms that are unrecognized (e.g. coronavirus, [2] ); (ii) microorganisms whose geographical range is increasing (e.g. West Nile virus); (iii) microorganisms whose incidence has increased (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis); (iv) microorganisms whose virulence has changed (e.g. Neisseria meningitidis); or (v) microorganisms that have acquired antimicrobial resistance (e.g. Mycobacterium spp. and Salmonella spp.). New strains of microorganisms that cause known diseases but that have acquired new immunological and virulence characteristics, or that have newly acquired resistance against antimicrobial agents, are frequent causes of EIDs. Infectious diseases caused 15 million deaths in 2002, with respiratory infections (3.9 million), AIDS (2.9 million), diarrhoeal illnesses (1.9 million), tuberculosis (1.6 million) and malaria (1.1 million) being the main causes (http://www.who.int); many of these had EID components.",

Ships, aeroplanes or other vehicles can disseminate vectors of microorganisms, such as birds and insects. When insects arrive in a new environment, they have to adapt to the new ecosystem and establish themselves-dissemination to adjacent areas may then follow. An example of this situation is the West Nile virus, which was first identified in 1990 in blood collected from a woman from Uganda. This virus is a common pathogen in tropical Africa, the Middle East, and Eurasia. The first outbreak in western countries occurred in New York in 1999 and affected 59 persons. West Nile virus is disseminated by mosquitoes belonging to the Culex genus and by birds. Its propagation has a seasonal component, because mosquitoes are quiescent in winter. Recently, an outbreak was reported in Italy [5] . Chikungunya fever is another example of the contribution of commerce and tourism to the dispersion of vectors of infectious diseases. This infection is caused by the CHIK virus, a zoonotic virus endemic to Africa, India and Southeast Asia and transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, mainly members of the subgenera Aedimorphus, Diceromyia and Stegomyia [6] . In Europe, it was first recorded in Albania in 1974 [7] , and the most recent outbreak occurred in northeastern Italy in the province of Ravenna during the summer of 2007. About 200 human cases with high fever, arthralgia, myalgia, severe headache and rash were recorded [8] . Aedes albopictus was considered to be the most likely vector for this outbreak. An additional potential problem is the capacity of this mosquito to transmit other arboviruses, e.g. dengue virus. For this reason, arboviruses previously believed to cause only tropical diseases must now be considered as potential agents of disease in Mediterranean countries [9] .",

[10] analysed 1321 African immigrants in Spain, and the cosmopolitan imported diseases most frequently found were anchylostomiasis, HIV disease, chancre, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea, and diarrhoea caused by Giardia lamblia. Among the tropical imported diseases that they found were schistosomiasis, intestinal amoebiasis, and malaria.

There are multiple ways by which environmental changes could contribute to the emergence and spread of infectious diseases: natural disasters (e.g. flood, drought, earthquake, and famine), deforestation, global warming, and climate change [1] . Deforestation, road construction, irrigation, intensive agriculture and animal production systems, uncontrolled spread of human habitat, lack of public health and contamination are examples of environmental changes caused by human activity that facilitate the emergence of infectious diseases. Zoonotic transmission of infectious diseases is facilitated by encroachment of human habitation and the loss of niche environments [3] . However, the pathogen must first establish itself in the new environment, and pathogens that need a vector or an intermediate host will have a restricted distribution, depending on vector or host adaptation to, or availability in, the new environment. Non-zoonotic means of transmission, such as person-person or faecal-oral transmission of infectious diseases, can be affected by living conditions, size or density of population, sexual habits, and population levels of immunization. In addition, human behaviour has contributed to a number of EIDs within different populations. The most recognized is the role of sexual behaviour in the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV disease. Alcoholism, body piercing, tattooing, intravenous drug abuse and changes in eating habits have also been responsible for EIDs.",
