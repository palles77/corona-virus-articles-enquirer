Cytological examination of pleural exudates revealed severe purulent inflammation with abundant clusters of rod-shaped microorganisms with a clear surrounding halo. Treatment was ineffective and the ferrets died 2e5 days later. Two ferrets were subjected to necropsy examination, which revealed pyothorax, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and multiple white nodules (1e2 mm) in the lungs. Microscopical examination showed multifocal necrotizing-pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia and lymphadenitis with aggregates of encapsulated microorganisms, some of which were positively stained by periodic acideSchiff and alcian blue. In-situ hybridization for Pneumocystis spp., ZiehleNeelsen staining and immunohistochemistry for distemper, coronavirus and influenza antigen were negative in all cases. Electron microscopically, the bacteria were 2e3 mm long with a thick electron-lucent capsule. Microbiology from one ferret yielded a pure culture of gram-negative bacteria identified phenotypically as Pseudomonas luteola. This speciation was later confirmed by 16S RNA gene amplification.",

All three were males, one was neutered (number 1) and none had contact with other ferrets or animals. Ferrets 1 and 2 were 3 years old and ferret 3 was 2 years old. The animals were not vaccinated against canine distemper virus or rabies. Ferrets 1 and 2 presented with depression, dehydration, anorexia, hyperthermia and acute onset dyspnoea. There was no history of prior medical problems. Complete blood counts and serum biochemical examinations revealed anaemia, severe neutrophilic leucocytosis with toxic neutrophils, hyperglycaemia and hypoalbuminaemia. Ferret 2 also had hyperglobulinaemia. Radiographic findings included a unilateral pleural effusion (right-and left-sided in ferrets 1 and 2, respectively) and a mediastinal mass displacing the trachea dorsally. Ultrasonographically, in ferret 2 there was a large quantity of hypoechoic effusion within the thorax and a heterogeneous ill-defined soft tissue mass was observed in the left mediastinum. Approximately 20 ml of purulent fluid were removed by thoracocentesis. Both ferrets were treated similarly with oxygen supplementation, crystalloid fluids, antibiotics (enrofloxacin, clindamycin and metronidazole), itraconazole, buprenorphine, ranitidine and sucralphate. Both animals died within 2e5 days of presentation.",

            "text": "The present report describes a newly recognized respiratory bacterial infection of ferrets presenting with acute dyspnoea, pyothorax and severe pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia, lymphadenitis and mediastinitis. Bacterial culture and molecular taxonomy confirmed P. luteola as the causative agent in one animal. Although microbiological cultures could not be performed in the other two cases, the intralesional microorganisms were indistinguishable from each other by cytological and histopathological examination as well as by TEM. For this reason, we hypothesize that P. luteola could be the cause of this pyogranulomatous pneumonia and mediastinitis in all of these ferrets. P. luteola infection has been described in rainbow trout (Altinok et al., 2007) , but no cases have been found in animals, birds or reptiles. In mink, P. aeruginosa causes a fatal and acute haemorrhagic suppurative pneumonia, but no predisposing factors have been conclusively identified (Trautwein et al., 1962; Long and Gorham, 1982) . Previous studies in man showed that P. luteola may cause septicaemia, peritonitis, meningitis, dermatitis and endocarditis in patients with different underlying diseases or with indwelling devices (Chihab et al., 2004) . The ferrets of this report probably acquired the infection by the respiratory route, as other organs were not affected. However, the origin of the infection and the incubation period remain unknown. Humans (owners and clinicians) that came in contact with these animals did not show clinical signs of illness at any time, including before and after the animals were clinically ill. However, a clinical infection in a human patient mimicking mediastinal lymphoma caused by P. luteola has been described recently, and in that case there were similar histopathological lesions and microorganism morphology (Goteri et al., 2010) as described for the ferrets of this report. These results may suggest a predilection of this infection for the lower respiratory tract and the mediastinal lymph nodes of man and ferrets. Thus, this infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of pyogranulomatous pleuropneumonia and mediastinitis in the ferret and further research is needed to elucidate the zoonotic potential of ferrets in the transmission of the infection.",

TEM revealed numerous viable and dividing bacteria with surfaces frequently contained multiple vesicular blebs of cell membranes, a change consistent with endotoxin release. Moreover, viable leucocytes were present, but no phagocytosis was observed, suggesting that the inflammatory response in these animals was unable effectively to fight the infection. Based on this observation, we offer two hypotheses. The first is based on the possibility that bacteria were able to elude the inflammatory response; the second hypothesis speculates an ineffective immune reaction due to immune suppression or concomitant infectious and non-infectious diseases.",

The polysaccharide capsule has been associated with an antiinflammatory effect in P. aeruginosa infection in human patients with cystic fibrosis. In contrast, flagella are related to the stimulation of innate host defence (Cobb et al., 2004) . In this case, the abundant bacterial colonies with a thick polysaccharide capsule, coupled with the absence of flagella and phagocytosis observed by TEM, could have triggered a similar evasion mechanism of the inflammatory reaction in ferrets. On the other hand, bacterial capsules were positively stained by PAS and alcian blue, with more abundant positive colonies in ferret 1 than 3. This could suggest the presence of different clones of the same bacteria or, possibly, chemical changes in bacterial capsule during the course of infection, for which the significance is unknown. With regard to the second hypothesis, the diagnostic techniques used showed no predisposing, concomitant, infectious or non-infectious disease. No previous immunosuppressive therapy was reported, no histological evidence of predisposing viral or toxic damage was observed and IHC was negative for some of the most common ferret viral pathogens, including AI, Fig. 5 .
