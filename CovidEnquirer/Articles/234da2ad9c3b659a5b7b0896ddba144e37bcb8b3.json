Improvements in asthma education and discharge planning were noted, but the changes were not statistically significant. Conclusions: After the implementation of an evidence-based guideline reminder card, medication treatment for acute asthma in the ED was significantly improved; however, asthma education and discharge planning remained unchanged. Future efforts on promoting guideline-based practice in the ED should focus on these components. \u00aa",

This study was conducted to examine whether asthma management in the pediatric emergency department (ED) was improved through the use of an evidence-based acute asthma care guideline reminder card. Methods: The Pediatric Acute Asthma Management Guideline (PAMG) was introduced to the ED of a pediatric tertiary care hospital in Ontario, Canada. Medical charts of 278 retrospective ED visits (JanuaryeDecember 2002) and 154 prospective visits (July 2003eJune 2004) were reviewed to assess changes in acute asthma management such as medication treatment, asthma education, and discharge planning. Logistic and linear regressions were used to determine the effect of PAMG on asthma management in the ED. The propensity score method was used to adjust for confounding.",

For example, they were more likely to receive supplemental oxygen (9.7% versus 3.2%, p Z 0.0074), salbutamol (96.8% versus 83.1%, p < 0.0001), ipratropium bromide (77.3% versus 66.2%, p Z 0.0161), and oral Analyses of acute asthma management on a quarterly basis in the retrospective period showed no obvious changes in clinical practice pattern over time before the implementation of PAMG (data not shown).

Nevertheless, there was still substantial room for improvement compared to guideline recommendations.

However, many barriers, such as the allocation of adequate staff time for patient education, adjustment of content to meet individual patients' needs, and the assessment of learners' comprehension, 30 often exist and make it difficult to implement or document asthma education activities.

First, without a randomized controlled trial, it would be difficult to assess the possible influence of clinical advances or other system changes on the effects we observed. In the current study, it also was possible that physicians in the prospective study period were aware that they were being evaluated and therefore documented clinical processes more vigorously. Second, all medical charts were reviewed by one chart abstractor who was not blinded to the study hypothesis and the subject status. This is the most common limitation in medical record review studies in emergency medicine 32 and could have introduced bias to the study results. To minimize this bias, standard chart abstraction form with clear variable definitions and abstraction guideline was used in the current study. Third, our study cohort was a non-random sample of patients who attended the ED of a tertiary children's hospital. So our findings may not be generalizable to patients managed in EDs in community setting. Finally, providers may not document all clinical activities in the medical charts, and therefore discrepancies between medical chart review and clinical care provided to patients may exist and could have influenced the validity of chart abstraction data, especially on asthma educational activities. 33 However, it has been shown that compared to directly observed care, medical chart review was more accurate on certain key aspects of assessment (e.g., oxygen saturation) and treatment (e.g., oral corticosteroids prescribed at discharge) in the ED. 33 ",
