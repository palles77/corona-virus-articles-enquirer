This has led to the displacement of large numbers of people, including skilled healthcare workers, who have had to flee their countries because of war.

            "text": "In 2006, the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean entered a 5-year cooperative agreement with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to strengthen the capacity of countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region for surveillance and laboratory detection of influenza viruses. This funding supported the establishment and enhancement of influenza surveillance and laboratory detection across the Region, and technical support, assistance and guidance to member states were provided by the WHO Regional Office. This programme was extended for another five-year period in 2011, with a primary focus on strengthening capacity in three areas-(1) to enhance epidemiological and virological surveillance of influenza, (2) to estimate the disease burden associated with influenza, and (3) to support policies to introduce and increase the use of seasonal influenza vaccines. The programme's objectives stemmed from the rationale that those countries with strong influenza surveillance and vaccine programmes would be better prepared to respond to an influenza pandemic. Building on the success of the first five-year period of improving influenza surveillance in WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region during 2006-2011, the second five-year period between 2011 and 2016 saw further improvements in all three areas of enhancing influenza surveillance, estimating disease burden and use of influenza surveillance data to develop informed policies and strategies for control of influenza. The funding support to seven priorities countries via the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP) in 2014 greatly supplemented the ongoing works of the Regional Office and spurred the momentum that already generated through the support of US CDC to strengthen influenza surveillance programme in the Region. This paper highlights the capacity achieved in the countries of WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region in the areas of influenza surveillance system between 2011 to 2018 in each of these three areas-influenza surveillance and laboratory detection; influenza disease burden estimation; and use of seasonal influenza vaccines for influenza control. Owing to availability of comparable, consistent and representative data, the progress and improvement of influenza surveillance system, in the Region, was measured between the situations prevailing in 2011 and 2018.",

Information on influenza disease burden was collected from the articles published in peer-reviewed medical journals from the Region. We used the following four outcome indicators to measure improvements in three focus areas of influenza surveillance and esponse: (1) evidence that a country col-lects and reports epidemiological surveillance data; (2) evidence that a country is testing and reporting influenza virus types and subtypes with EMFLU and FluNET; (3) evidence that a country has published influenza disease burden estimation using surveillance data and/or other data or published information; and (4) progress in introducing seasonal influenza vaccines as part of influenza control programme. We further reviewed the progress in each of these four outcome indicators through analysing the influenza surveillance programme performance indicators that were used in the cooperative agreement of CDC and WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office for measuring progress over time in improving influenza surveillance system. Information collected from WHO global and regional databases (EMFLU, FluID and FluNet) were further triangulated through direct oral or written communication with Ministry of Health officials whenever required. The improvement achieved against each of these four outcome indicators by the end of 2018 and further reviewed by available evidence, were compared with the situation prevailing in 2011 (when the first five-year period of CDC Cooperative agreement on influenza surveillance programme ended and the second five-year period began) in order to assess improvement and measure progress.",

Using these data, we calculated the increase in the total number of sentinel sites across the region between 2011 and 2018. We also calculated the change in the number of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) detected and reported to FluID and EMFLU in each year by the countries between 2011 and 2018. The increase in number, wherever reported and evidenced, was used as an indication of improvement in influenza surveillance system in the Region as a whole. We also accessed regional data from FluNet for 16 national influenza centres (NICs) for analysis and calculated the change in the total number of specimens processed and tested annually between 2011 and 2018. Lastly, in order to measure the capacity in the Region to detect, test and ship influenza specimens, we calculated the change in the number of specimens shared with the WHO Collaborating Centres for the bi-annual vaccine strain selection.",
