Florida's share of the 300,000 annual deaths from obesity is far greater than the deaths associated with global outbreaks of the West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), bird flu, and all 4 hurricanes that struck Florida in 2004 added together. Yet the hoped-for public outcry against major Florida health insurers who terminated patients' access to bariatric surgery was limited to a few newspaper articles and miscellaneous media headlines.",

Of even greater concern, these insurers' position contradicts the recent conclusion of an expert panel convened by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in November 2004 [1] . The Medical Coverage Advisory Committee (MCAC) expert panel, comprising physicians, surgeons, insurance executives, and health policy experts, concluded that bariatric surgery is safe and effective. We believe that the major driving force for terminating patients' access to bariatric surgery is based heavily on insurance companies' financial considerations.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, Florida health insurers have faced explosive growth in the utilization of bariatric surgery, a 10-fold increase over the last 5 years (7000 gastric bypass procedures in Florida in 2003). The 3-year trailing costs (an insurance industry benchmark) were many standard deviations higher than insurance executives had budgeted for. In addition, the acceleration of and opportunity for bariatric surgery brought to the field some enterprising physicians and hospitals that lacked appropriate training and ultimately jeopardized safe, effective, and comprehensive patient care. This dizzying influx of untrained and inexperienced bariatric surgery providers left the health insurance community with the opinion that many programs were the equivalent of simple street peddlers. Poor patient selection, poorly executed procedures, poorly equipped hospitals, and poor patient follow-up resulted in an exponential increase in serious complications and patient deaths in startup programs. These poor outcomes gave insurers credible ammunition supporting their decision to terminate patients' access to bariatric surgery. Dramatically publicized complications and patient deaths have reached a sympathetic public ear that has been demanding physician and hospital accountability, continuous quality improvement, and a reduction in preventable medical errors. The Centers of Excellence program developed by the American Society for Bariatric Surgery (ASBS) through the Surgical Review Corporation, which became functional in June 2004, should address this issue of quality bariatric surgical care.",

To educate these insurers on the benefits of bariatric surgery for clinical severe obesity, I met with several local insurers' medical directors. My efforts, as well as the efforts of Dr Harvey Sugerman, President of the ASBS, who met with Dr. Barry Schwartz from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, led nowhere, however.",

The many surgeons who attended the meetings were supportive of pursuing legislative action and grass-roots movements. But the mechanisms for executing these decisions were nonexistent. The ASBS was busy with the upcoming annual meeting, the growing controversy of our new journal, and the critically important CMS meeting. Action by our partner, the American Obesity Association, did not materialize. My visit with Dr. Harvey Sugerman to Florida Secretary of Health Dr. John O. Agwunobi in August 2004 was intended to educate the Secretary about the benefits of bariatric surgery and ask for assistance in reinstating access to bariatric surgery. At the conclusion of our meeting, Dr. Sugerman and I concluded that the Secretary provided us with an education in politics. We learned that science alone does not yield policy and that we needed to take a different approach to be effective. Under these conditions, I sought the help of Mr. Vincent Zeringue, a wellknown health care consultant with national experience in the area of cardiovascular technology.",

After several meetings with Mr. Zeringue, we decided that we would make elected and appointed officials, as well as the general public, aware of Florida's current crisis as it related to obesity and obesity management. Through personal contacts and interaction with patients in our bariatric program, we secured appointments with both state and national elected and appointed officials. Florida Representative Sandra Murman was instrumental in crystallizing our needs, agenda, and strategy. Within 2 days of meeting with Representative Murman (Fig. 3) , we obtained appointments with key Florida lawmakers in Tallahassee. We were surprised, but pleased, to learn that these Florida lawmakers knew about the obesity crisis and that some were aware of Florida insurers' retraction of coverage for bariatric surgery. At the conclusion of our day in Tallahassee, one thing was crystal clear: Mandating coverage for bariatric surgery was not an option at this time, given the current legislative and political landscape in Florida.",

Many lawmakers have agreed to help us initiate and maintain constructive talks with Florida insurance companies and, as necessary, mediate our differences. The purpose of these tripartite meetings would be to bring about a comprehensive solution to the crisis of access to care and to implement practical solutions that address concerns about quality assurance in bariatric surgery.

Develop a memorandum of understanding to (a) reinstate patient access to bariatric surgery and the addition of coverage for secondary prevention services, and (b) outline a credible credentialing process to ensure quality care in Florida-based bariatric centers through the ASBS Centers of Excellence program. This advocacy endeavor is significant and will not be easy. Our task-to obtain coverage and payment for secondary prevention services and reinstate coverage for bariatric surgery-is enormous, but corresponds with our responsibility to our vulnerable patients. We have a historic opportunity to lead in the fight against the obesity epidemic and further our knowledge. Along with this great opportunity comes the great responsibility to ensure quality care and safe and effective long-term care for obesity and its related comorbidities. We must hold ourselves accountable in making such difficult decisions to eliminate substandard medical practice and regulate ourselves; otherwise, the \"fifth hurricane\" will ravage Florida and the rest of the nation.
