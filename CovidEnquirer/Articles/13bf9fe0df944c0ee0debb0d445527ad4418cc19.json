As Sia or their variant forms 24 are receptors for influenza A and influenza C viruses, we examined the effects of these 25 modifications on virus infections. We confirmed that 9-O-acetyl and 7,9-O-acetyl 26 modified Sia are widely but variably expressed across cell lines from both humans and 27 canines.

A migrase enzyme has been proposed to aid in the transfer of the acetyl group from 68 C7 to C9, however a specific enzyme has yet to be identified (5, 8, 9) . CasD1 is 69 localized in the late Golgi, so acetyl modifications are added during the later stages of 70 protein glycosylation. The regulatory processes that control the number of acetyl groups 71 added or their positions have not been well defined, although clear differences in 72 expression of 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac have been reported in mouse and human tissues, 73 chicken embryos, and some other animals (10, 11). CasD1 uses acetyl-CoA and likely 74 has a preference for CMP-Neu5Ac as a substrate, so that it is less active on CMP-75 Neu5Gc (7). The existence of an enzyme to facilitate the migration of acetyl groups from 76 C7 has been proposed, but not identified (5). 77",

Overall, these results show that SIAE regulates 255 in infection efficiency in any of these cells (Fig. 6A) .

Only the Ann Arbor strain recovered infectivity in MDCK CasD1-OX 268 at much lower levels than in MDCK WT, likely due to the lower surface expression of 9-269 O-and 7,9-O-Ac in these cells. It therefore appears that 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac do not 270 strongly influence IAV infection, likely due to their low levels of expression. However, 271",

It is 89 therefore still unclear how these two isoforms are regulated in humans or other animals, 90 whether their expression relates to CasD1, or what controls the levels and locations of 91 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac expression. 92 Sia O-acetylation and de-acetylation play important roles in many different 93 biological processes, particularly in development, cancer, and immunology. For 94 example, O-acetyl modifications to Sia may alter the binding of host lectins, including 95 the Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs) (3, 5, 14). Siglecs are 96 regulators of many different cell functions and developmental processes -examples 97 include B-and T-cells where the presence of 9-O-acetyl Sia modulates immune cell 98 activation and differentiation (15). In B-cells, negative regulation of B-cell receptor 99 (BCR) activation by Siglec CD22 is mediated by binding to Neu5Ac-terminated glycan 100 chains on the BCR, which can be blocked by O-acetyl modifications (16, 17). The 101 presence of 9-O-Ac can also reduce the activity of sialidases, including human 102 neuraminidases (18). Incorrect regulation of 9-O-Ac, 7,9-O-Ac, and SIAE activity has 103 been linked to autoimmune disorders through the development of auto-antibodies (17, 104 19). 9-O-Ac and 7,9-O-Ac and their regulation by SIAE also appear to play important 105 roles during early stages of embryonic development, spermatogenesis, and in different 106 forms of cancer including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, colon cancer, and breast 107 cancer (20-23).",

To better understand the control of 193 expression of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac, glyco-engineered cells lines were created by 194 manipulating the expression of CasD1 and SIAE genes. To do this, we knocked out 195 CasD1 via CRISPR-Cas9 editing, or over-expressed CasD1 via transfection of an 196 expression plasmid. Knock-out variants of CasD1 (\u0394CasD1) were prepared from 197 MDCK-NBL2, A549, and HEK-293 cells using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of early exons in 198the CasD1 gene(Fig. 4A). \u0394CasD1 clones were confirmed by examining for 7,9-O-and 199 9-O-Ac display, and then by PCR and sequencing of the genomic region surrounding 200 the deletion in modified Sia negative clones(Fig. 4A).

These modified Sia are present in secreted mucus on 277 mucosal surfaces, including GI and respiratory tissues, where they can potentially 278 control many interactions with both normal flora and pathogens. However, there is still 279 little known about the details of their display levels, cell association, and the ways in 280 which their synthesis is regulated either in cells or on mucosal surfaces. While there 281 have been suggestions that 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac might influence IAV infection by 282 interfering with HA binding or NA activities, direct evidence for their effects is sparse. In 283 contrast, ICV is known to use 9-O-Ac as its primary receptor for cell binding and 284 infection. Here we use a number of new tools to define the cell-specific expression of 9-285 O-and 7,9-O-Ac and provide a preliminary test of their effects on IAV and ICV infection. 286 We confirmed that 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac are expressed on cells in culture and that 287 expression varies between cell lines, as has been previously reported (34).

A 300 summary of the synthesis and localization of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac is shown in Figure 7. 301 To look more closely at the expression and roles of 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac 302 modifications and their effects on viral infections, we prepared glyco-engineered cell 303 lines that lacked these modifications or that expressed higher levels of CasD1. A 304 deletion and frame shift in CasD1 completely removed both 9-O-and 7,9-O-Ac 305 expression, confirming this enzyme was responsible for creating both modifications, 306 likely through addition to the C-7 position, from which it migrates to the C-9 position (5, 307 8, 9). Adding CasD1 back into the cells by plasmid transfection restored modified Sia 308 expression, but none of the cell clones isolated showed universally higher levels of 309 modified Sia synthesis and population heterogeneity was still seen. The CasD1-310 transfected HEK-293 cells showed the greatest increase, while for A549 and MDCK 311 cells expression was similar to or lower than WT cells. However, even in the HEK-293 312 CasD1-OX cells, 9-O-Ac still only accounted for ~1.5% of total Sia and 7,9-O-Ac was 313 not detected. This indicates that the levels of these modifications are not only controlled 314 by the expression of CasD1, and could be regulated by other processes. Additionally, 315",

Expressing CasD1 from a plasmid in 321 \u0394SIAE HEK-293 and A549 cells resulted in an additional small increase in 9-O-Ac that 322 was still Golgi associated, but with little increase in expression on the cell surface. 323 Similar to the CasD1-OX cells, no increase in 7,9-O-Ac was seen in either \u0394SIAE and 324 \u0394SIAE+CasD1 cell lines by HPLC analysis. Both \u0394SIAE+CasD1 lines had altered 325 growth rates compared to WT cells: HEK-293 \u0394SIAE+CasD1 had delayed growth rates, 326 while A549 \u0394SIAE+CasD1 had increased growth rates. This suggests that dysregulation 327 of SIAE and CasD1 by gene manipulation affects cell metabolism and growth in a cell-328 type specific manner, possibly through the build-up of glycoproteins in the Golgi or 329 through dysregulation of the sialic acid recycling pathway. These affects on cell growth 330 could have implications for cancer and organismal development, as these variant Sia 331 are involved in both these processes (15-17, 20-23, 41). Further research is needed to 332 determine how 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac expression is regulated, how they are transported 333 within the ER and Golgi, and their roles in cell growth. Of particular interest will be 334 disentangling the individual regulation of 7,9-O-Ac from 9-O-Ac, as their does seem to 335 be differences in how they are regulated both in our cells and in previously reported 336 expression in animal tissues (10, 11). 337 Studies with two strains of IAV showed no differences in infection efficiency in 338 WT HEK-293 or MDCK-NBL2 cells compared to their \u0394CasD1 or CasD1-OX variants. 339 All rights reserved.

In addition, these modifications vary considerably in their localization348 and have an inherent heterogeneity within cell populations. While the presence of both 349 7,9-O-and 9-O-Ac were dependent on the activity of CasD1, the relative proportions, 350 levels of expression, and localization appear to be controlled by more complex 351 mechanisms than simply the expression of CasD1 and SIAE. How this regulated 352 expression affects cell homeostasis is unknown, but it is likely relevant during 353 development, immune responses, and in cancers that show dysregulation of 7,9-O-and 354 9-O-Ac expression.

Both influenza A (IAV) and influenza C (ICV) viruses use Sia as 112 their primary receptors for host recognition and cell entry, but with different effects of Sia 113 modification. IAV interacts with Sia through two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin 114 (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA binds Sia to initiate the endocytic uptake of the virus 115 by the cell, leading to fusion between the viral envelope and the endosomal membrane 116 at low pH (24). NA is a sialidase which cleaves Sia off glycan chains when it is present 117 in mucus or on the surface of cells, allowing the virus to penetrate to the epithelial cells, 118 and also preventing aggregation of newly produced virus after budding (25, 26). In 119 contrast to IAV, ICV has one surface glycoprotein, the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion 120 protein (HEF), which serves similar purposes to both HA and NA. HEF binds specifically 121 to 9-O-acetyl Sia to initiate uptake of the virus into cells, while the esterase domain 122 removes 9-O-acetyl modifications, releasing the virus from mucus, and disassembling 123 virus aggregates after budding (27). While the role of O-acetyl modified Sia for ICV 124 infection is well documented, how these modifications affect IAV is not well 125 characterized.
