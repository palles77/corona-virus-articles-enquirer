The APP C-reactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin peaked 24 h later than the cytokines and reached higher levels in serum than in BALF. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) only increased in BALF. Lung virus titres tightly correlated with BALF IFN-a, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-a, IFN-c and IL-12, as well as with serum IL-6, IFN-a and IFN-c. Signs of disease correlated with the same cytokines in BALF and serum, as well as with BALF LBP and serum CRP. The findings suggest that IFN-c and IL-12 play a role in the pathogenesis of SIV and that APPs are induced by cytokines. This influenza infection model may have value in assessing the therapeutic potential of cytokine antagonists.",

The pigs were from two sows and were housed in Horsefall-type isolation units with positive-pressure ventilation and were fed ultra-high-temperature-treated cow's milk supplemented with antibiotics. Two pigs were sham-inoculated with PBS and euthanased the next day. The 14 remaining animals were inoculated IT with SIV and euthanased at 24 h (n = 3), 30 h (n = 2), 48 h (n = 3), 72 h (n = 3) and 120 h (n = 3) PI. Euthanasia was by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (Natrium Pentobarbital 20%, Kela). A 'score' of clinical disease severity was attributed to each animal just prior to euthanasia based on each of the following clinical signs: anorexia, depression and coughing whereby one point was assigned for the presence of each of these signs. Where the respiration rate was 60-90/min and >90/min, one and two additional points were added to the clinical score, respectively.",

The cytokine is expressed in precursor form within cells prior to its enzymatic cleavage by IL-1b converting enzyme and release (Ghayur et al., 1997) . The ELISA used in our study detects this extra-cellular, mature form of IL-18. High concentrations of IL-18 were found in rat lung homogenates by ELISA (Jordan et al., 2001) and both pro and mature IL-18 have been detected in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Puren et al., 1999) . Low IL-18 concentrations in the BALF of un-infected 1-day-old gnotobiotic pigs had increased significantly by 2 and 4 weeks following infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Muneta et al., 2008) . Similar elevations were found 3 days PI in mice inoculated with herpes simplex virus type 1 (Reading et al., 2007) and human macrophages secrete IL-18 after inoculation with H3N2 influenza virus (Pirhonen et al., 1999) . Poxvirus and papillomavirus proteins bind IL-18 (Xiang and Moss, 1999; Cho et al., 2001) as does the IL-18-binding-protein, induced by IFN-a (Kaser et al., 2002) . It is possible that the concentration of IL-18 is affected by changes in the concentration of IL-1b converting enzyme, also involved in the secretion of IL-1b and in apoptosis (Lynch et al., 1997) . The reduced IL-18 response found in our study does not fit with the role attributed to this cytokine in the clearance of influenza virus in a murine infection model (Denton et al., 2007) .",

These PRCV-infected animals also had unchanged serum and elevated BALF LBP concentrations, whilst serum HG levels peaked later than in SIV-infected pigs. The finding that LBP increased in BALF and not in serum suggests local pulmonary production of LBP, a hypothesis supported by the finding that A549 human epithelial cells produce LBP in response to IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a (Dentener et al., 2000) .
