C, Beneath the outer serosa, longitudinal and circular muscle layers produce peristaltic and segmental contractions for propelling and mixing the luminal contents. The submucosa is rich in blood and lymphatic vessels. The mucosa comprises the thin muscularis mucosa, the lamina propria, and the columnar epithelium; it is thrown into folds and is covered by finger-like villi to increase the digestive and absorptive surface area. D, Enterocytes, which are shed from the villus tip but are continually replaced through division of crypt cells, are the site of nutrient digestion and absorption. Goblet cells secrete protective mucus. Water-soluble nutrients pass into the rich capillary network of the lamina propria, and fat is passed as chylomicrons into the lacteals. Immunocytes in the lamina propria are involved in maintaining tolerance to luminal antigens. E, The luminal membrane of the enterocyte is thrown into processes called microvilli, which increase the luminal surface area. Tight junctions between enterocytes maintain epithelial integrity. Absorbed nutrients are passed from the enterocyte into the intercellular space for distribution to the body. F, Schematic of a microvillus showing digestive hydrolases anchored in the phospholipid cell membrane and protruding into the intestinal lumen. Carrier proteins in the membrane are believed to act as \"pores,\" shuttling nutrients across the membrane by means of conformational changes in their structure often induced by sodium influx at the expense of energy utilization through Na/K-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) on the basolateral membrane.",

At the surface of mixed micelles, triglyceride is hydrolyzed by pancreatic lipase to di-and monoglycerides and free fatty acids . Maximal lipase activity in the gut lumen is dependent on a protein cofactor, colipase, which is secreted by the pancreas as inactive procolipase. There is some reserve capacity for fat digestion if pancreatic function is normal, and a fat-rich diet, especially one rich in unsaturated fatty acids, also stimulates increased pancreatic lipase secretion. However, neuroendocrine mechanisms initiated by the presence of fat in the duodenum and ileum, control the rate of gastric emptying and hence the rate of fat delivery.

Nevertheless, fructose uptake in cats is low, and D-xylose absorption is equally low. This may be one reason why the xylose absorption test is unhelpful in cats.

The short MMC phase is a period of intense contractile activity that sweeps undigested food, secretions, desquamated cells, and bacteria down the intestine. This process is known as the intestinal housekeeper wave and is induced by motilin secretion. Erythromycin can stimulate motilin receptors and at low doses it can be prokinetic mimicking the MMC; higher doses overstimulate and may cause emesis.

Reduced segmental motility may lead to rapid transit, and decreased peristalsis delays transit, conditions manifesting clinically as diarrhea and ileus, respectively. Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) is absorbed by receptor-mediated endocytosis in the ileum (see , but the process is complex so that intact cobalamin is absorbed and potentially harmful analogues are excluded. Following ingestion, cobalamin is released from food in the stomach and then bound by R proteins (haptocorrins), which are nonspecific binding proteins of salivary and gastric origin. At acidic pH, cobalamin has high affinity for R proteins, but on entering the more alkaline environment of the SI, R proteins bind cobalamin less avidly and undergo proteolysis. Thus cobalamin is transferred to another binding protein, intrinsic factor, which promotes cobalamin absorption in the ileum. The source of intrinsic factor is the stomach and pancreas in dogs and solely the pancreas in cats. Intrinsic factor-bound cobalamin complexes pass to the ileum until they bind specific receptors and are endocytosed. Cobalamin is passed into the portal blood where it is bound to a protein, transcobalamin 2, enabling it to enter tissues and to be reexcreted in bile. Inherited abnormalities of the cobalamin-intrinsic factor receptor in breeds such as the Giant Schnauzer and Border Collie cause selective cobalamin deficiency.",

Although there are recent studies into pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, much controversy remains. To make a diagnosis of IBD, detailed investigations must be undertaken to exclude other potential causes of intestinal inflammation; nevertheless, the likelihood is that IBD represents a syndrome comprising a group of disorders with similar characteristics, rather than a single disease entity. It should be noted that canine and feline IBD bear little resemblance histologically or failed to reveal a diagnosis. Thus the client should always be made aware that surgical biopsies may ultimately be required. Endoscopic biopsies should always be taken, even in the absence of gross abnormalities, because microscopic changes may be present but only the duodenum (and proximal jejunum, if accessible) are biopsied routinely via gastroscopy, while ileal biopsies may be obtained via colonoscopy. Multiple specimens (a minimum of six from each area) should be collected, because small size, artifacts, and fragmentation can make interpretation difficult. The size and quality of endoscopic biopsies depends not just on the equipment available, but also on the pressure exerted by the forceps, which is in part dependent on the operator's experience. At laparotomy, fullthickness biopsies are usually taken from at least three sites, the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. Intestinal biopsies can also be obtained laparoscopically, but evidence of a greater diagnostic utility than endoscopy or greater safety than surgery has yet to be proven.",

Furthermore there is emerging evidence that ileal biopsies are more likely to be diagnostic than duodenal. As expected, fewer biopsies are needed to reliably detect architectural changes the better their quality (i.e., better size, depth, and integrity) and more specimens are needed the deeper the lesion. Therefore the clinician should always interpret endoscopic biopsy results cautiously; results should be questioned if the tissue diagnosis does not fit the clinical picture, or if the response to apparently appropriate therapy is poor.

Increased concentrations of acute phase proteins (e.g., C-reactive protein) have been documented in canine IBD in some, 17 but not all studies. 18, 19 Recent studies suggest decreased acute-phase proteins in feline IBD. 20 Initial semiquantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) studies suggested increased cytokine gene expression in canine chronic enteropathies, 21 and this has been confirmed in one, 22 but not all, 23 more recent studies that have used real-time PCR methodology. Again, these results differ from feline studies, where histopathologic evidence on mucosal inflammation correlated with increases in a range of cytokines. 24 Unfortunately, in all of these studies, gene expression alone was assessed, and not the functional protein. However, in a recent study, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b3 protein was not detected in the serum of 15 dogs with IBD. 16 The reasons for such discrepancies are not known but may relate to the fact that the chosen gold standard throughout was histopathology, which itself is variable and lacks consensus among pathologists. 2 An alternative possibility is that the many studies have assessed patients in various stages of disease, and it may be that immunologic responses differ, and this lead some researchers to suggest the alternate name of \"chronic enteropathy.\" 18",

Briefly, the intestinal mucosa has a barrier function (\"immune exclusion\"), and controls exposure of antigens to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, which must generate protective immune responses against pathogens while remaining \"tolerant\" of harmless environmental antigens such as commensal bacteria and food. IBD develops when the normal decision-making process breaks down, leading to inappropriate immune responses and uncontrolled inflammation. Critical to the development of inflammation is a breakdown in tolerance to normal luminal antigens (particularly endogenous bacterial species). This loss of tolerance may result from disruption of the mucosal barrier leading to excessive antigen exposure to the underlying immune system, from dysregulation of normal mucosal immune system function, or from a combination of these processes. The end effect is uncontrolled inflammation, which is the result of activation of the many effector pathways. The inflammation can then lead to architectural disruption, resulting in adverse effects on function, which depend upon the part of the bowel affected.",

Thromboembolism and remote organ failure is seen in some patients with PLE. Other systemic consequences of IBD include thrombocytopenia and arthropathies and typical signs may be noted. However, such reports are rare, 27 and in my opinion these are uncommon findings in both canine and feline IBD. Progression of disease is variable and, in some cases, signs may wax and wane.",

For example, increased CIBDAI has been seen in dogs with food-responsive conditions, and values decreased on successful treatment. 29 More recently, a variation of CIBDAI, the canine chronic enteropathy activity index (CCEAI; see Table 57 -3) was proposed. 18 All of the same signs are scored as for the CIBDAI, but additional characteristics are also assessed (e.g., presence of ascites and/or peripheral edema, pruritus, and serum protein concentrations). A recent study shows that this need for parenteral supplementation.

Histopathologic assessment of intestinal biopsies remains the gold standard for diagnosis of many intestinal diseases, but has marked limitations, most notably variable quality of tissue specimens obtained endoscopically 44 and poor agreement between histopathologists. 45 The latter may be a result of the subjective nature of interpretation of the degree of inflammation, the patchiness of inflammation, or the presence of edema (caused by hypoproteinemia) leading to difficulties in assessing cell density. It can be difficult to distinguish severe LPE from lymphoma, particularly when endoscopic biopsy samples are examined. This may be a result of the fact that infiltration of malignant lymphocytes is patchy, that inflammatory change may accompany alimentary lymphoma (and predominate in some areas), or that lymphocytic infiltration is deep to the area sampled. Cases of feline alimentary lymphoma can be missed if duodenal endoscopic biopsy samples are used in histopathologic assessment, rather than full-thickness excluded. Investigations include fecal analyses, routine hematologic analysis, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, assay of serum TLI, pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity, and diagnostic imaging. Although none of these tests is diagnostic for IBD, they help to eliminate the possibility of extraintestinal disease (e.g., pancreatitis, hypoadrenocorticism, renal failure, and hepatic failure), anatomic intestinal disease (e.g., tumor or intussusception), and other known causes of intestinal inflammation. Diagnostic imaging in particular allows the clinician to determine whether focal or diffuse intestinal disease is present, allowing selection of the most appropriate method of intestinal biopsy. In many cases, standardized therapeutic trials can help to confirm the diagnosis, by eliminating other possible causes of intestinal inflammation.",

Most recommendations are based upon individual experience because objective information of efficacy is generally lacking, and no randomized controlled clinical trials have been conducted. A staged approach to therapy is recommended whenever possible, but may not be appropriate in seriously ill patients (e.g., those with severe hypoproteinemia) where immediate intervention with combination therapy may be essential. Where sequential therapeutic trials are used, initial treatment should be with antiparasitic agents to eliminate occult endoparasite infection. I most commonly use fenbendazole at 50 mg/kg q24h PO for 3 to 5 days. However, not all parasites are sensitive to this drug (e.g., Trichomonas in cats) and resistance may be present in other organisms (e.g., Giardia). Subsequently, an exclusion diet and antibacterials should also be employed, before the use of immunosuppressive medication is considered. Some authors no longer bother with Immunosuppressive Drugs Undoubtedly, the most important therapy for idiopathic IBD is immunosuppression, although this should only be considered a last resort. In human IBD, glucocorticoids and thiopurines (e.g., azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) are the most widely used. 63 In dogs and cats, glucocorticoids are most frequently used for immunosuppressive therapy in SI IBD, and prednisolone (or prednisone) is the drug of choice. The standard initial dosage in dogs is 1 mg/kg PO q12h, given for 2 to 4 weeks, and then tapered slowly over the subsequent weeks to months. In most cases therapy can be only be reduced to a low maintenance dose given q48h, and in the minority of cases can be completely withdrawn. Cats are usually treated with higher doses, typically twice those of dogs (2 mg/kg q12h PO initially, then tapering).",

However, it is feasible that resistance to steroids may have developed, because of induction of the multiple-drug resistance gene and expression of P-glycoprotein. 51 Despite the widespread use of these drugs in companion animal gastroenterology, controlled clinical trials demonstrating efficacy are lacking.

In theory, such diets should be less antigenic; this supposition is supported by recent work, in an experimental model of canine food-allergic skin disease, demonstrating reduced in vitro antigenicity compared with the native molecule. 59 The other major advantage of utilizing protein hydrolysates is the improved digestibility of the protein components, which may be superior to traditional single-source protein exclusion diets. Thus they are now the exclusion diet of choice for many clinicians, and a recent clinical trial was encouraging. 60 Whichever type of diet is chosen, it must be palatable and should be introduced in gradually increasing amounts over 4 to 7 days.

Oral administration of cobalamin is ineffective and it must be given by subcutaneous injection (e.g., 20 \u00b5g/kg q7days for 4 weeks and then the same dose q28days for a further 3 months). Serum cobalamin concentration should be rechecked a month after the last dose and should be supranormal at that time, indicating that cobalamin supplementation can be discontinued. Less commonly, folate malabsorption may accompany severe and prolonged SI IBD, and oral supplementation is easily achieved with administration of approximately 1 mg of folic acid per day. Although such therapy is well-tolerated, no published studies are available to support the therapeutic benefit of such an approach.",

However, this approach is not universally accepted and a recent study suggests that antibacterial therapy is of limited benefit in canine IBD. 52 Metronidazole remains the preferred antibacterial for SI IBD, and it has long been suggested to have immunomodulatory properties in addition to an antimicrobial action. Tylosin also may have immunomodulatory effects and may have some efficacy in canine IBD. Although there are few studies demonstrating the efficacy of these drugs in companion animal IBD, a recent study in a rat model of IBD (colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid) suggests that tylosin is effective at decreasing inflammation. 61 This work is particularly interesting in light of the recent report of a series of dogs with diarrhea that responded to tylosin therapy. 62 However, the relationship between this condition and the IBD syndrome is not well understood. dogs with SI IBD present with severe microcytic anemia 31 and these may require intravenous blood replacement (whole blood or packed red cells). Furthermore, oral ferrous sulfate (at 200 mg/dog) may be required for a prolonged period (often months).",

Moreover, the remaining small bowel often assumes a bacterial flora more typical of the large bowel. This problem is further exacerbated with resections of the ileocolic sphincter.",

Villus atrophy is caused by loss of enterocytes, decreased precursors in intestinal crypts, infiltrative disease causing villus fusion, and mechanical destruction of the absorptive surface area (e.g., massive gastric acid emptying into the intestine with gastrinoma). Enterocytes can be damaged by bacteria (e.g., damage to the microvillar membrane) or can be immature and poorly functional as a result of accelerated turnover. Infiltrates of the mucosa can affect mucosal permeability, villus structure and function, and lymphatic flow; therefore the host's immune system may be integral to the ultimate severity of the intestinal lesion. Intestinal pathology from any number of causes might allow otherwise normal luminal bacteria to proliferate or persist, in turn causing worsening of enterocyte damage and/or more mucosal inflammation. Finally, animals severely malnourished and protein-deficient from the intestinal disease may have a more difficult time repairing intestinal damage.

Intestinal lymphangiectasia patients in particular often have normal-appearing feces. 2 Ascites (low-protein transudate) and/ or peripheral edema may be the only historic or physical examination findings, especially in lymphangiectasia patients. Weight loss is common but may be \"hidden\" by the ascites, unappreciated until palpation reveals boney prominences across the body. Two breeds at risk for PLE are the soft-coated Wheaton Terrier 9 (Wheaton Terriers may have concurrent PLN) and the Norwegian Lundehund. 10 Yorkshire Terriers have an increased risk for PLE, based upon data reported from one institution. 11, 12 Chinese Shar-Pei and Basenji dogs are prone to severe IBD with concurrent PLE. 2 Hypoalbuminemia is the key clinicopathologic finding in PLE. Panhypoproteinemia is \"classic\" but not invariable. 2 Patients who hyperglobulinemic prior to developing PLE (e.g., chronic inflammation caused by rickettsial, fungal, cutaneous, or heartworm infection) may lose most of their serum proteins but still have normal serum globulin concentrations. Lymphopenia sometimes occurs if the intestinal lymphatics are involved in the disease process. Hypocholesterolemia is common and expected, but is also seen in hepatic insufficiency. Hypocholesterolemia is not typically seen in PLNs (which sometimes helps distinguish between these causes). Hypocalcemia is common finding, 5 and would appear to be secondary to hypoalbuminemia in many patients, but suppression of parathyroid function 11, 12 and/or decreased vitamin D 13 may be responsible in others. The hypocalcemia is seldom associated with tetany. It is more clinically useful to measure ionized serum calcium as opposed to total serum calcium. Hypomagnesemia often occurs in severe PLE and may contribute to hypocalcemia by affecting parathyroid function. 11, 12 Fecal \u03b1 1 -PI concentrations are generally increased in this patient population. 14 Ultrasound sometimes reveals \"streaking\" within the mucosa, presumably associated with the dilated lymphatics in lymphangiectasia. 15 A thickened segment of bowel is palpated in many patients with GI intussusception, although this can be easily missed if the intussusception takes place at the root of the mesentery. Young dogs with a recent history of enteritis (e.g., parvoviral, parasitic) from which they should have recovered, but which continue to have diarrhea, is suggestive of the disorder. Finding hypoalbuminemia in these same patients strongly suggests parasites or intussusception. Abdominal ultrasound is the best way to noninvasively detect intussusceptions.",

Even then, the subsequent rise in serum albumin tends to be transient because the administered albumin is all too quickly lost from the body. Generally ascites should not be removed unless it is causing a substantial problem (e.g., diaphragmatic compression and dyspnea). Removing ascites removes albumin as well as fluid, which ultimately lowers the total body albumin concentration, making it easier for ascites to reform. To lessen ascites, one may administer hetastarch IV (10 to 20 mL/kg), which hopefully stays in the intravascular compartment longer than albumin because of its size, thereby drawing third space fluid into the intravascular compartment. Although one may administer furosemide (2 to 4 mg/kg BID-TID) to lessen ascites, it is best to administer moderate doses. Massive doses of diuretics can deplete the intravascular compartment and cause hypovolemia. In emergency situations (e.g., severe dyspnea as a consequence of pressure on the diaphragm), an abdominocentesis can be performed but only to remove sufficient fluid to alleviate the dyspnea. Patients should be monitored for hypomagnesemia, which can complicate cases and worsen hypocalcemia. If magnesium supplementation is necessary, a continuous rate infusion of MgSO 4 in 5% dextrose in water (35 to 50 mg/kg/day) is preferred. Orally administered magnesium tends to act as a laxative. Lymphangiectasia is primarily treated by feeding an ultra-low-fat diet to minimize lacteal dilation and rupture. 2 Historically, mediumchain triglyceride oil was supplemented to the diet to provide calories without causing lacteal dilation. Most ultra-low-fat diets were high in fiber and lacking in calories; hence, the supplementation. High fiber concentrations are not optimal because the patient often needs caloric support. If an ultra-low-fat diet without a lot of fiber is fed, medium-chain triglyceride oil is unnecessary (which is fortunate because the oils are expensive and not very palatable).",

Decreasing gastric hyperacidity with H 2receptor antagonists (famotidine 0.5 mg/kg) or proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole 0.7 to 1.5 mg/kg daily) and suppressing the proliferation of the intestinal microflora (oral broad-spectrum antibiotics) are important components of therapy. 3 The patient should receive parenteral nutrition until it is able to maintain itself on oral nutrition, which usually means multiple, small feedings of highly digestible diets, sometimes including monomeric or polymeric elemental diets. Some SBS patients may need supplementation with vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) and the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).

Prevalence of B. procyonis can be very high; the organism was detected in 12.7% of 188 raccoons in a recent study in Tennessee. 11 Dogs occasionally are infected by B. procyonis and the life cycle can be completed in the canine host. Toxocara spp. and T. leonina have worldwide distribution. Prevalence rates vary by the study, region, and age of animals tested with puppies and kittens more likely to have patent infections. For example, the overall prevalence rate for ascarid infections in cats was 2.92% in one study. 2 In other studies, T. cati was detected in 33% of kittens, 12 21% of feral cats, and 18% of pet cats. 13 In one large study of 1,213,061 dogs examined at 547 private veterinary hospitals in 44 states of the United States, 5.04% of samples contained eggs of T. canis. 1 Pathophysiology B. procyonis, Toxocara spp., and T. leonina eggs are passed in feces. Infective larvae then develop in the environment after varying time periods (B. procyonis, 2 to 4 weeks; T. leonina, 1 week; Toxocara spp., 2 to 4 weeks) and can survive in the environment for months to years depending upon environmental conditions. Once larvation has occurred, B. procyonis, T. leonina, and Toxocara spp. eggs are infectious for a variety of hosts, including people (B. procyonis and Toxocara spp.). All three genera are transmitted by ingestion of embryonated eggs or by ingestion of tissues from other infected vertebrate hosts. Embryonated Toxocara spp. eggs have been transmitted by earthworms, flies, and cockroaches, and have been found on the fur of pets. 14, 15 Raccoons tend to use favored defecation sites called latrines that often include rooftops, woodpiles, decks, base of trees, barns, and outbuildings, and these sites can become heavily infected by B. procyonis. After ingestion of larvated eggs, the prepatent periods for B. procyonis, T. leonina, T. canis, and T. cati are 7 to 10 weeks, 8 to 10 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks, respectively.

After ingestion of infective Toxocara spp. eggs, the larvae are released, penetrate the bowel wall, migrate to the liver via the systemic circulation, and then migrate to the lungs of infected dogs and cats. The migrating larvae induce inflammation while migrating through the liver and lungs of puppies and kittens. Hepatic migration rarely results in measureable clinical disease, but pulmonary migration can cause extensive damage, resulting in clinical signs of disease and occasionally death. After reaching the lungs, Toxocara spp. larvae either undergo tracheal or somatic migration. After somatic migration, the larvae encyst in tissues. For T. canis and possibly B. procyonis, the larvae can be reactivated by a triggering mechanism like pregnancy and migrate to the placenta, resulting in infection of the puppies. Transmammary transmission of T. canis can occur but is not as important for ascarids as for the hookworms. In young puppies or kittens, tracheal migration is more likely to occur leading to patent infections intestinal infections. As the puppies or kittens become adults, somatic migration is more likely, which explains the lower prevalence of infections in older animals. Toxocara spp. infections acquired by ingestion of infected vertebrate hosts result only in intestinal infections. supplementation is needed in some cases with chronic iron deficiency.",

If puppies and kittens are not evaluated until 6 to 8 weeks of age or later, CAPC recommends the administration of a monthly preventive according to label recommendations from that point forward with administration of an anthelmintic 2 weeks later. If heavy hookworm infections have occurred in dogs, fenbendazole can be administered to pregnant bitches from the fortieth day of gestation through the fourteenth day of lactation. Kennel floors and runs should consist of tarmac or concrete, be free of crevices, and be kept as clean and dry as possible. Bedding in kennels and free feces in the environment should be removed daily to lessen larval contamination. CAPC recommends fecal examinations two to four times in the first year and one to two times per year thereafter, depending on the age of the animal and its prior history of infection to assess efficacy of the initial treatments, efficacy of the monthly control product, and client compliance.",

Although these syndromes are relatively rare, many people are infected by Toxocara spp. Sera collected between 1988 and 1994 from 30,930 people 6 years of age or older in the United States had an age adjusted Toxocara seroprevalence rate of 13.9%. 16 In general, prevalence rates are greater in children because of potential for geophagia and otherwise poor hygienic practices.

The role of fiber, silymarin, or probiotics in addition to antimicrobial therapy is unknown at this time. Some cats and dogs with resistant cryptosporidiosis have underlying diseases (e.g., IBD, T. foetus, and immunodeficiency syndromes) and the diagnostic workup should be continued if therapeutic failures occur.

Approximately 20% of the oocysts produced in the intestine are \"thin-walled\" oocysts that fail to form an oocyst wall. These oocysts rupture within the intestines and when the sporozoites are released, autoinfection occurs, which allows for rapid amplification of infection. In one study of cats inoculated with C. parvum, C. parvum DNA was detected by day 2 after inoculation, but oocysts weren't detected until day 7. 26 Thick-walled oocysts are passed in the feces, are environmentally resistant, are infective when passed, and are the likely source of new infections. Although infection of dogs and cats with these agents is common, most infected animals do have clinical signs. Diarrhea is generally more common in young animals. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] Coinfection with other protozoans like Giardia spp. (dogs and cats) or Tritrichomonas foetus (cats) may be associated with more significant illness than with single infections. 42, 43 The presence of immunosuppressive disorders like lymphoma, feline leukemia virus infection, and canine distemper virus can potentiate the development of clinical signs of disease. When it occurs, Cryptosporidium spp. diarrhea is associated with impaired intestinal absorption and enhanced secretion. Histopathologically, infected animals show loss of intestinal microvilli, degeneration of host epithelial cells, villus atrophy, and lymphocyticplasmacytic infiltration. 37, 44 It is possible that susceptibility to cryptosporidiosis in animals could have a genetic component as suggested for humans. 45, 46 Clinical Examination Most dogs or cats with Cryptosporidium spp. infection are clinically normal. When diarrhea occurs, it is usually watery, without mucous, blood, melena, or straining, and therefore is classified as small boweltype diarrhea. On abdominal palpation, the SI may feel slightly thickened. Some of the infected dogs or cats with Cryptosporidium spp. infection and diarrhea have had underlying diseases like IBD, lymphoma, T. foetus, canine distemper virus, and/or feline leukemia virus, and so may have physical examination findings consistent with these conditions. Clinical signs of disease appear to be more likely in cats infected with C. felis than dogs infected with C. canis.",

Modified acidfast staining of a thin fecal smear can be performed to aid in the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis.

However, acid-fast staining only detects approximately 70% of Cryptosporidium spp.-infected animals when a single sample is tested. 48 Fecal antigen tests for Cryptosporidium spp. are available for use with human feces, but results of these assays have been variable when applied to feces from infected animals.

Host specificity was thought to be minimal for Giardia spp., but not all small animal isolates cause disease in human beings. There have been varying results concerning cross-infection potential of Giardia spp. Recent genetic analysis has revealed two major genotype assemblages in people. [18] [19] [20] Assemblage A (Giardia duodenalis) has been found in infected humans and many other mammals including dogs and cats. Assemblage B (Giardia enterica) has been found in infected humans and dogs, but not cats. There are specific genotypes of Giardia that commonly infect dogs (Giardia canis; Assemblages C and D) and cats (Giardia felis; Assemblage F) but are uncommonly identified in people. Prevalence rates for Giardia infection vary depending on the area studied, the diagnostic method used, and the health status of the animal, however, prevalence rates are commonly 5% to 10% in healthy or clinically ill dogs or cats. 3, 12, 13, 15, 24, 25, 59 Pathophysiology Giardia spp. are found on the surface of enterocytes, with the highest concentrations of the organisms being found in the duodenum of dogs and the ileum in cats. As the organisms are on the surface, pathogenesis is unlikely to be secondary to direct cell damage. Some of the pathogenic mechanisms proposed for Giardia spp. infections include production of toxins, disruption of normal flora, induction of IBD, inhibition of normal enterocyte enzymatic function, blunting of microvilli, and dysmotility. 60 There are many subclinically infected dogs and cats, and so Giardia is not always an effective primary pathogen. It has proven difficult to induce clinical signs of diseases in otherwise normal experimentally infected animals. For example, in one study, administration of 10 5 cysts induced infection in only 17 of 26 kittens of which diarrhea was only detected in 1 kitten for 1 day. 61 There may be strains than vary in their pathogenicity or other host factors may play an important role in determining whether disease will develop. The presence of immunosuppressive diseases or coinfections may potentiate the development of clinical signs of disease as discussed for cryptosporidiosis. 43, 62 Clinical Findings Many dogs and cats have subclinical infection. When clinical disease occurs, the diarrhea is soft to watery and frequently has adherent mucus. Chronic malabsorption occurs in some animals and weight loss may be readily detected. On physical examination the SI may be slightly thickened and the animal can appear unthrifty. There may also be physical examination findings of coexisting syndromes that may potentiate giardiasis.",

            "text": "Healthy pets are not considered significant human health risks by the Centers for Disease Control (www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/brochure/ oi_pets.htm) and there is no current recommendation to test healthy dogs or cats for Giardia spp. infection. However, some dogs and cats are infected with the zoonotic assemblages and the same assemblage has been detected in dogs and people in the same family. [92] [93] [94] [95] All healthy dogs and cats should be screened for hookworm and roundworm infection once or twice yearly as previously discussed. Thus healthy dogs and cats that are harboring Giardia cysts will be detected. As some Giardia spp. may be zoonotic, treatment of healthy infected animals should be considered with each owner. Treatment of healthy animals is controversial because all of the drugs can potentially cause side effects, animals with normal stools are not considered human health risks, treatment is unlikely to eliminate infection, and reinfection can occur within days. For example, in a study of naturally infected dogs, approximately 15% of treated dogs were still Giardia infected when rechecked 9 or 16 days after treatment. 76 In another study, 50% of the healthy, Giardiapositive dogs had adverse reactions to fenbendazole or nitazoxanide and 62.5% of those that successfully completed therapy were positive for Giardia cyst or antigen on day 34. 64 It is unknown whether these infections were not eliminated or if the dogs were reinfected. If treatment is deemed appropriate by the clinician and pet owner, many clinicians currently recommend administration of a 5-day course of fenbendazole in apparently healthy dogs and cats that test positive for Giardia. The American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) Advisory Panel on Zoonoses recommends attempting to remove the source of infection during the treatment period and performing a fecal centrifugal flotation after Giardia treatment one on antimicrobial sensitivities. It is likely that sensitivities vary amongst different isolates and it is currently impossible to predict which anti-Giardia drug will be effective in an individual case. Although there have been multiple drugs used for the treatment of giardiasis in dogs and cats, there are few studies that utilized dose titrations and evaluation of drugs in experimentally infected animals. In most studies, fecal samples were only assessed for short periods of time after treatment and neither was immune suppression induced nor necropsy performed to evaluate whether infection was eliminated or merely suppressed. Infection with Giardia does not appear to cause permanent immunity and so reinfection can occur, a finding that also hampers assessment of treatment studies.",

            "text": "The primary goal of Giardia treatment is to stop diarrhea. Because healthy pets are not considered significant health risks to immunocompetent people, elimination of infection (which is difficult) is a secondary goal. Treatment options currently available or used historically include metronidazole, tinidazole, ipronidazole, ronidazole, fenbendazole, albendazole, pyrantel/praziquantel/febantel, quinacrine, furazolidone, and nitazoxanide (Table 57-6) . [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] Care should be taken when using metronidazole or ronidazole as central nervous system (CNS) toxicity can occur. [84] [85] [86] Because albendazole is associated with bone marrow suppression, many clinicians use fenbendazole or febantel when that class of drugs is chosen. 87 If clinical findings suggest concurrent C. perfringens overgrowth, use of metronidazole may be indicated as this drug is an antibiotic with activity against Clostridium spp. If there are clinical findings that suggest concurrent infection with a nematode, fenbendazole or febantel are indicated. Many clinicians currently use fenbendazole once daily for 3 to 5 days as initial therapy. Some clinicians currently recommend the combination of metronidazole and fenbendazole (www.capcvet.org). Others only resort to combination therapy if there is evidence of a persistent infection that is not cleared by monotherapy. If the first drug fails to control diarrhea and the organism is still detected in feces, a second drug from an alternate class is indicated. The addition of fiber to the diet may help control clinical signs of giardiasis in some animals by helping to suppress bacterial overgrowth or by inhibiting organismal attachment to intestinal microvilli. Immunotherapy with the Giardia vaccine has aided in eliminating cyst shedding and diarrhea in some infected dogs. 88 However, in a controlled study in 16 experimentally infected cats, vaccination as immunotherapy was ineffective with one strain of Giardia. 89 In addition, both commercial products have been discontinued.

From 1% to 30% of the fecal samples or rectal swabs taken from healthy domestic pet dogs, 16.7% of dogs boarded in kennels, and 21.5% of hospitalized dogs were found to be positive on bacteriologic culture for Salmonella. From 1% to 18% of healthy cats and 10.6% of random source research colony cats were also culture-positive for Salmonella (summarized in reference 122). Despite these findings, several species of Salmonella have been impugned in the pathogenesis of acute enterocolitis in dogs and cats. Salmonella typhimurium is the species most commonly isolated from diarrheic feces of dogs and cats, although other species have been identified. [134] [135] [136] Pathophysiology Those most at risk for Salmonella infection are young and immunoincompetent animals, those with concurrent GI infections (e.g., parvoviral or parasitic infections), and those animals who have had prior therapeutic interventions (e.g., antibiotics or glucocorticoids). 110 Salmonella is an enteroinvasive organism that induces an acute inflammatory response resulting in enterocolitis, mucosal sloughing, and secretory diarrhea. Most Salmonella infections are resolved via the local immune response, but bacterial translocation and septicemia may evolve into systemic inflammatory response and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes in some patients.

[144] [145] [146] [147] [148] CCV RNA has been amplified from the feces of more than 40% of dogs with gastroenteritis in some countries, 145 but CCV RNA can also be amplified from the feces of normal dogs. Canine respiratory coronavirus is genetically distinct from canine enteric coronavirus. 149 Pathophysiology CCV is transmitted by fecal-oral route via a contaminated environment and is highly contagious especially in neonatal puppies. Older dogs can be infected but seem to be less likely to develop clinical signs of disease. The inoculation period is approximately 1 to 4 days. CCV replicates intracellularly in the intestinal microvilli which become short and blunted. Necrosis and hemorrhage are rare in contrast to canine parvovirus infections. There are CCV variants that are more pathogenic than others and disease appears to be unusual in puppies greater than 6 weeks of age in the United States. 150, 151 Co-infection with other infectious agents like canine parvovirus was thought to potentiate CCV-associated illness in some studies. 152 than supportive therapy. Antibiotic therapy in such cases may prolong fecal shedding and encourage development of the carrier state. In animals with severe hemorrhagic diarrhea, history of immunosuppression, suspected or documented septicemia, and/or evidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, parenteral antibiotics should definitely be used. If culture results are unavailable, therapy should include enrofloxacin, amoxicillin, or trimethoprim-sulfa, all of which are effective against Salmonella. Posttreatment cultures should be performed to confirm eradication, and pet owners should be advised of the public health importance of the disease.",

The snail releases free-living cercariae that penetrate the skin of salmon, lose their tails, and become metacercariae that develop in a number of tissues of the salmon with heavy concentrations in the kidneys, liver, heart, and tail. The life cycle is completed when the adult trematode develops in the intestine of mammals or birds that eat fish. The syndrome has also been induced in dogs that have been fed infected snails. N. helminthoeca survives through all stages of the trematode. The adult flukes develop deep within the intestinal tissues causing local edema and inflammation in 5 to 6 days. The fluke releases N. helminthoeca, which infects intestinal histiocytes and disseminates in blood and lymph to lymphoid tissues.

Villus blunting, decreased absorption, inflammation, and necrosis are responsible for the classic signs of vomiting and diarrhea, the latter of which frequently contains blood.

In one study 33% of feral cats that presumably had not been vaccinated had FPV antibody titers. 179 Pathophysiology Previously exposed or vaccinated cats generally limit FPV replication and remain clinically normal. After a susceptible cat has oronasal exposure to secretions containing FPV, viremia occurs with an incubation period of approximately 2 to 7 days prior to development of clinical signs of disease. As for CPV in dogs, FPV invades and destroys actively dividing cells including those of the bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, intestinal epithelium, cerebellum of young animals, retina, embryonic, and fetal cells. In the GI tract, the resultant cellular destruction results in dilated intestinal crypts, degeneration of villi, edema, and necrosis, which are responsible for the clinical signs of disease. High numbers of viral particles are shed during the acute phase of infection and may be detected in feces for weeks following clinical recovery. FPV can survive for longer than a year in a suitable external environment.",

Although the existence of this condition in humans is not disputed, its existence in canine patients has been a subject of much controversy. By conventional methods of microbial culture in humans, SIBO is diagnosed when upper small intestinal bacterial numbers exceed 10 5 or 10 4 CFU/mL of intestinal juice for total bacteria and obligate anaerobes, respectively. Although these values were initially adopted for dogs, a number of studies suggest a larger microbial population (e.g., 10 7 CFU/mL or greater) in asymptomatic dogs. 6 Small intestinal bacterial numbers are also greater in cats. Therefore the current diagnostic criteria for SIBO in companion animals are inappropriate, and may lead to misdiagnosis in many cases. Nonetheless, a genuine bacterial overgrowth may exist in conditions equivalent to those in humans, and it is appropriate to use the term SIBO in such circumstances.",

            "text": "There is much debate about what constitutes a normal bacterial population in dogs and cats. When luminal contents are sampled and conventional bacterial culture techniques are used, common species include Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Clostridium sp., and Bacteroides sp., with a greater proportion of obligate anaerobic bacteria being reported in cats than in dogs. However, greater diversity can be seen when mucosal populations are assessed in addition to luminal contents. 1 Recent studies employing newer techniques (e.g., sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, fluorescence in-situ hybridization), demonstrate that conventional techniques underestimate the true complexity of the bacterial flora because a significant number of bacterial species do not grow. 2, 3 By conventional techniques, the total upper small intestinal bacterial counts of healthy cats range from 10 2 to 10 8 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and are higher than those reported in humans (<10 3-5 CFU/mL). 4 However, there is no clear consensus as to what constitutes a \"normal\" SI population in healthy dogs, and some studies suggest that healthy dogs can harbor up to 10 9 CFU/mL bacteria in the proximal SI. 5,6 Therefore, when using conventional culture techniques, the \"cutoff\" for normal flora in dogs and cats cannot be extrapolated from humans. Furthermore, clinicians must realize that numbers are likely to be greater, when taking into account the species that cannot be cultured by conventional means. The SI flora is relatively resistant to dietary changes; studies using different diets, or the addition of fructooligosaccharides to the diet have failed to demonstrate significant effects on the number or type of bacteria in the proximal SI of dogs and cat, 7,8 although some effects have been demonstrated on the colonic flora in cats. 9 The resident bacterial flora is an integral part of the healthy SI; organisms are broadly divided into those with health positive effects, those that are health neutral, and, finally, those species that may have health-negative effects (Table 57-7; Figure 57 -19) . Beneficial effects include inhibition of the growth of bacterial pathogens (by producing antimicrobial factors, occupying receptor sites, and competing for nutrients), facilitating digestion and absorption of various nutrients, synthesizing vitamins, and stimulating immune function. 10 Health-negative effects include intestinal putrefaction, production of carcinogens, hepatic damage, and clinical signs such as diarrhea and constipation. In addition, studies implicate the intestinal flora in the development of obesity in humans. 11 Finally, loss of immunologic tolerance to the normal bacterial flora has been implicated in the development of chronic intestinal inflammation, abnormal intestinal function, and perhaps even neoplasia. An inability to tolerate a normal bacterial flora may explain the antibiotic-responsive enteropathy in German Shepherd dogs. 12",

In humans, SIBO arises secondary to a number of underlying disorders that interfere with the control permeability and the presence of brush-border enzyme defects. 13, 14 A further extension of the hypothesis of defective mucosal barrier is the suggested association with IgA deficiency or dysregulation. 17 Some, but not all, reports suggest that German Shepherd dogs with intestinal disease may have defective small intestinal IgA production, although mucosal IgA + plasma cell numbers in affected dogs are either normal or increased. 18 However, IgA deficiency has not consistently been identified in German Shepherd dogs, 19, 20 and the pathogenesis may be more complex. Recent studies suggest differences in relative expression of allelic variants of the IgA heavy gene in various dog breeds including German Shepherd dogs. 21, 22 However, there is no clear association between the different allelic variants and the manifestation of GI disease. 23 A further suggestion is that ARD arises secondary to a loss of tolerance toward endogenous bacterial antigen. Indirect evidence for this hypothesis comes from the findings that dogs with ARD have increased lamina propria CD4 + T cells and increased expression of certain cytokines. 18, 24 Such a hypothesis is supported by the fact that antibacterial agents lead to resolution of clinical signs, and decreased cytokine expression, but not a decline in bacterial numbers. 24 That the most effective antibacterials are those with immune-modulating properties (e.g., oxytetracycline, metronidazole, tylosin) may support this hypothesis. A final possibility is that the condition arises from defective acquired immune responses to an occult infectious agent (e.g., enteropathogenic E. coli or Clostridium species). Therefore the predisposition of German Shepherd dogs to this syndrome could be explained by genetic susceptibility to infection as a result of major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression. In this respect, there could be similarities in pathogenesis with histiocytic ulcerative colitis in Boxer dogs. 25 At the current time, there are many suggestions as to the pathogenesis of idiopathic ARD. Unfortunately, there is currently no direct evidence to support any particular hypothesis and further work is required.",

In addition, there was complete resolution of signs while on tylosin and, in many cases, relapse occurred upon discontinuation of therapy. The main difference from the classical description of idiopathic ARD was that a range of ages of dog was represented, and a mixedpattern diarrhea noted. However, its true idiopathic nature was not demonstrated, as detailed diagnostics were lacking in many cases. Despite this limitation, the similarities with idiopathic ARD are striking; although the authors of the paper favored the term tylosin-responsive diarrhea, the likelihood is that this is a form of idiopathic ARD.",

            "text": "The most common signs for secondary SIBO and idiopathic ARD are chronic small intestinal diarrhea and weight loss or failure to thrive. Other signs include vomiting, appetite alterations (anorexia, polyphagia, scavenging, and coprophagia), excessive borborygmi, and abdominal discomfort. In addition, signs of large bowel diarrhea are sometimes noted. Signs are similar for tylosin-responsive diarrhea aside from the fact that a mixed-pattern diarrhea is seen. 16 Potential associations have been reported for SIBO (Box 57-5). In all such conditions it is logical to assume that a genuine increase in bacterial numbers occurs, although few studies have documented its magnitude or whether the overgrowth is actually responsible for the clinical signs. Furthermore, although diagnostic investigations may identify the presence of secondary SIBO, in practice it is better to concentrate the diagnostic effort on identifying the underlying process. As in humans, therefore, canine SIBO is best viewed as a clinical sign or pathogenetic mechanism rather than a diagnosis in its own right. The consequences of a secondary SIBO include interference with absorption of nutrients (including cobalamin and possibly taurine) and fluid, because of microvillar enzyme dysfunction, altered mucosal permeability, deconjugation of bile acids, and stimulation of colonocyte secretion. 13, 14 Idiopathic Antibiotic-Responsive Diarrhea Historically, the term idiopathic SIBO was used to describe an antibiotic-responsive condition of large-breed (especially German Shepherd) dogs, 13 in which no underlying cause could be recognized. In fact the most consistent sign, as suggested by the name, is a predictable response to and remission with antibacterial therapy. Given that recent studies question whether a genuine increase in bacterial numbers occurs, these cases have been renamed idiopathic antibiotic-responsive diarrhea (ARD). 12 Although cats might feasibly suffer from secondary SIBO, an idiopathic antibiotic-responsive condition similar to that in German Shepherd dogs has not been documented in this species. 15 Most cases of idiopathic ARD have been seen in young German Shepherd dogs, although other breeds may be affected. There may also be similarities with the recently reported \"tylosin-responsive diarrhea\" (see later). 16 Recent hypotheses on pathogenesis suggest that host-bacterial interactions may be important. In this respect, ARD may develop secondary to defects in the mucosal barrier, aberrant mucosal immune responses, qualitative changes in the enteric bacterial flora, or a triangulation of these mechanisms. Defects in the mucosal barrier are supported by studies documenting abnormal documented in healthy dogs, while numbers as high as 10 9 CFU/mL have been found occasionally in cats and asymptomatic dogs. 4, 5, 8, 9 Some of the discrepancies may reflect difficulties and differences in the methodology, as numbers vary widely when individual animals are repeatedly sampled. 1 Use of an inappropriately low cutoff value will lead to the overdiagnosis of SIBO, probably explaining why it has been reported to be present in 50% of dogs with chronic intestinal disease. 27 In reality true secondary SIBO is rare, with the exception of SIBO secondary to EPI. An increase in small intestinal bacterial numbers has been documented in experimentally induced EPI, although bacterial numbers decrease upon treatment of the EPI with enzyme replacement. 28 Therefore in many cases the SIBO itself is of no significance. However, a proportion of naturally occurring EPI cases respond suboptimally to pancreatic enzyme supplementation alone, and may require concurrent antibiotic therapy. Given that the majority of dogs affected with EPI are German Shepherd dogs, it is not clear whether this is the result of secondary SIBO, or of a concurrent idiopathic ARD. Furthermore, duodenal juice collection is technically demanding, expensive, and rarely performed routinely. Attempts at improving diagnostic accuracy have included measuring bacteria in mucosal biopsies samples, but this has not been shown to be of added benefit. 1 Finally, quantitative PCR techniques may result in improved reliability by producing a more reliable bacterial yield 2,3 ; however, they have not yet been used as a means of attempting to diagnose possible SIBO.",

However, measurements of these parameters have poor sensitivity and specificity for canine SIBO, and cannot differentiate dogs with ARD from those with other etiologies. 12 Consequently the use of folate and cobalamin measurements for the diagnosis of SIBO, and especially ARD, is questionable.

For cases of idiopathic ARD, deterioration on glucocorticoid therapy may sometimes be noted in the history. Abdominal palpation may demonstrate a structural cause of secondary SIBO, for example, partial intestinal obstruction, although it is unremarkable in cases of idiopathic ARD.",

Furthermore, some authors question whether oxytetracycline should be used at all because it is associated with rapid development of plasmid-mediated antibiotic resistance. 34 However, given that longterm efficacy is maintained in most cases, oxytetracycline may not be acting through its antibacterial properties as it does not significantly reduce SI bacterial numbers. 24 Instead, it may either provide a selective pressure on the intestinal flora encouraging the establishment of less harmful bacteria or utilize immunomodulatory effects, which this antibiotic group possesses. Immunomodulatory activities also have been suggested for other antibacterials, namely metronidazole and tylosin, that are commonly used to treat ARD.

In acute experimental jejunal occlusion, intestinal motor activity is almost immediately altered. 16 Initially, there is increased motor activity proximal to the obstruction, and reduced motor activity distal to it (the intestinointestinal reflex, see Chapter 1). Within 2 to 3 hours, however, hypermotility extends proximally to the duodenum, and hypomotility extends distally from the obstruction to the terminal ileum. Following occlusion of the small intestinal lumen, continued peristaltic activity proximally leads to transient increases in intraluminal pressure. Normal intraluminal pressure rarely exceeds 4 mm Hg, whereas after experimental occlusion in dogs or cats, proximal intraluminal pressure is sustained between 5 and 10 mm Hg, and peaks at 20 mm Hg during intense contractions. 17, 18 In chronic partial obstructions, there is an extensive remodeling of the muscularis layer proximal to the obstruction leading to smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy, neuronal degeneration, neoangiogenesis, and fibrosis. [19] [20] [21] (Muscularis remodeling does not occur distally despite the local mucosal atrophy that develops acutely.) The net effect of these changes is an increase in wall stiffness, loss of slow-wave activity, reduced neural responses, and reduced contractile capacity. In chronic partial obstruction, wall stress and strain rise significantly proximal to the obstruction as a nature of intestinal foreign bodies tends to reflect local practices and customs. In cats, trichobezoars (hairball obstructions) can cause partial or complete intestinal obstruction, often at a site of preexisting infiltrative intestinal disease. 3 Obstructive trichobezoars are rarely diagnosed in dogs and when they are seen, it is usually at a site of preexisting intestinal narrowing. 4 Foreign bodies can lodge anywhere along the small and large intestine, and there does not appear to be a predilection site, except that the jejunum, because of its length, is the most commonly affected region. 1, 5 Linear foreign bodies may anchor around the base of the tongue, pylorus, or at more distal sites. 1, 6 Most linear foreign bodies do not themselves obstruct the intestine, but gathering and pleating of the intestine around the foreign object causes partial to complete obstruction.",

The clinical signs of intestinal obstruction vary with the site and completeness of obstruction, degree of distention, presence of peritonitis, and whether there is concurrent systemic sepsis. The most obvious clinical signs are anorexia, abdominal pain, depression, and vomiting. In experimental intestinal obstruction, these signs are followed by profound dehydration, shivering and ataxia, and eventually collapse, coma, and death. 34 Chronic partial foreign-body obstructions and chronic patent intussusceptions are generally less severe in their clinical signs, for example, bolus is advanced by peristalsis. Mechanoreceptor stimulation triggers further increases in pressure to force the chyme through the obstruction. This may lead to localized luminal bulging. Most of this remodeling and degeneration is reversible over time once the obstruction has been removed, although neuronal degeneration may be irreversible and hypomotility may persist in some patients, particularly in more chronic cases. 22",

Distal to the obstruction, villus atrophy of the mucosa and reduced brush-border enzyme expression develop rapidly. 18 Although physical disruption to local vascular supply occurs, increased vascular pressure is not the mechanism for fluid hypersecretion. When the jejunum is experimentally occluded surgically in gnotobiotic dogs, proximal segment hypersecretion does not take place, 23 illustrating the role of the enteric microflora in the pathogenesis of the continued fluid secretion proximal to the obstruction. Vomiting of this hypersecreted fluid contributes to the dehydration, acid-base, and electrolyte disturbances of the disorder. Although there is a relative hypersecretion, the actual volume of fluid that accumulates proximal to the acute obstruction is surprisingly small and of low protein content. 24 Intussusceptions commonly lead to more significant vascular compromise, and both lymphatic and venous vessels are occluded resulting in edema and hemorrhage, both intramurally, and into the intestinal lumen.

Rapid intervention improves the prognosis, although many patients do require preoperative stabilization. Establishment of adequate tissue perfusion by correcting dehydration is essential and of paramount concern. Volume resuscitation should continue until there is evidence of normal tissue perfusion, stabilization of central venous and arterial blood pressure, and urine production. In most cases, this can be adequately achieved using routine crystalloid replacement principles and therapy. Normal saline (0.9%) is reserved for cases of known hypochloridemic alkalemia because of its acidifying effects when administered in large volumes. The value of colloid solutions is still unsettled. In an experimental model of acute intestinal obstruction in dogs, the administration of synthetic colloid reduced loss of fluid into the intestinal lumen when compared with crystalloids. 47 This effect was consistent with a transient increase in plasma oncotic pressure. Nonetheless, evidence of improved outcome has not yet been provided in clinical patients, and the choice of crystalloids or colloids should be individualized according to evidence of low oncotic pressure and cost. A suggested approach is to start with crystalloid therapy, and administer a colloid solution if adequate perfusion and normotension cannot be achieved or maintained. In the face of severe hypotension (e.g., <60 mm Hg) or hypoalbuminemia, crystalloids, colloids, and plasma, may have to be administered concurrently.",

Unlike liquid barium, BIPS transit more closely approximates the transit of food in the GI tract. In cats and dogs that present for chronic vomiting or diarrhea, one protocol is to (a) administer the BIPS with food, (b) take radiographs 2 hours later to rule out gastric dumping, and (c) take radiographs at 8 hours to detect delayed gastric emptying. If the radiographs taken at 8 hours do not reveal some large spheres in the colon, a third set of radiographs later that same day or early the next morning should be taken to rule out partial bowel obstructions. Persistent bunching of the spheres in the SI is highly suggestive of physical obstruction of the small bowel, particularly if the markers have bunched in a dilated loop of SI or if \"graveling\" is apparent. If the small bowel loop in which the bunching occurs is not dilated or graveling is not apparent, a repeat radiograph should be taken 1 or 2 hours later to ensure persistence of the bunching.",

            "text": "Significant differences in physiology and pharmacology have been found in dog breeds. There are more than 400 breeds of dogs recognized worldwide and 156 breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club. Among these various dog breeds, several important differences in metabolism have been noted, for example, P-glycoprotein-mediated metabolism, copper storage, and growth rates. 4, 5 Differences in GI transit characteristics have also been noted. The GI tract of large-breed dogs (e.g., those weighing 60 kg) comprises 2.8% of their total body weight. In contrast, it comprises 7% of the total body weight of small-breed dogs (e.g., those weighing 5 kg). Breed-related differences in fecal water content could reflect differences in GI transit time, intestinal fermentation, diet, metabolism, and drug absorption. Using radiopaque markers (1.5-mm diameter administered in food), 12-week-old large-breed puppies (e.g., Great Danes) exhibited a significantly longer orocecal transit time (3.4 hours) as compared with small-breed puppies (e.g., Miniature Poodle, 2.5 hours). The longer transit time appears to reflect both a longer gastric emptying time and a longer small intestinal transit time among breeds. There also appear to be differences in intestinal permeability between dog breeds. The lactulose/rhamnose ratio reflects the relative absorption across the intestinal tight junction (transcellular absorption) versus the intestinal surface area (paracellular absorption, which occurs across the cell membrane of the enterocyte). The lactulose/ rhamnose ratio is substantially greater in the Greyhound breed than in the Golden Retriever breed. Breed and age characteristics must be taken into account when differentiating normal and abnormal transit times. Chapter 26 outlines transit study techniques and times in more detail.",

Opioids are a mainstay in the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Although opioids are very effective for pain relief from cancer and other nonmalignant diseases, their use is often limited by side effects. The most common adverse side effects are constipation and vomiting, but they also alter small bowel function causing opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Opioid-induced bowel dysfunction can occur immediately after the first dose and persist for the duration of therapy. The peripherally acting \u00b5-receptor antagonists methylnaltrexone and alvimopan are a new class of agents designed to reverse opioid-induced side effects on the GI tract without compromising pain relief. [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] Pathophysiology Endogenous opioids include endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins. They act selectively at opioid receptors composed of the \u00b5, \u03b4, and \u03ba subtypes. Opioid \u00b5 receptors are present in the central and peripheral nervous system, as well as the GI tract. There are many species and site differences, but \u00b5 receptors have been reported on the interstitial cells of Cajal, smooth muscle, and epithelial cells. The predominant opioid effect appears to be at the local level and includes stimulation of absorption (villus epithelial cells), inhibition of secretion (crypt epithelial cells), increased segmentation (circular smooth muscle), and reduced peristalsis (longitudinal smooth muscle; reviewed in Chapter 1 in greater detail). Exogenously administered opioids have the same overall effect of opioid inhibition of peristalsis and secretion leading to the syndrome of opioidinduced bowel dysfunction. 31, 32 ",

Intestinal dilation was confirmed at the time of surgery, and a 20-cm section of jejunum was resected. In the proximal jejunum, there was marked atrophy of the longitudinal muscle of the muscularis externa layer and diffuse severe degenerative vacuolar change within the myocytes and endomysial cells. The circular muscle layer was of normal thickness and morphology. Villus stunting and fusion were evident in the mucosa. In the distal jejunum, the mucosa and submucosa were normal, but the longitudinal muscle layer was markedly atrophic with focal degeneration, calcification, loss of myocytes, and replacement by proliferating fibroblasts.

Pseudoobstruction can also arise secondary to other underlying disorders, such as progressive systemic sclerosis, amyloidosis, muscular dystrophy, generalized neuromuscular diseases, endocrinopathies, infectious disease, and drug toxicity. 40",

Large granular lymphocytic intestinal lymphomas are generally very aggressive tumors, typically have heterochromatic granules, and are perforinpositive on immunohistochemistry. 46, [52] [53] [54] The second most common intestinal tumors are those of epithelial origin including adenocarcinoma (glandular), solid or undifferentiated carcinoma (no glandular formation), mucinous carcinoma (>50% mucinous), and signet ring carcinoma (>50% of the cells producing copious mucin which thereby gives a signet ring cytologic phenotype). 2, 9, 14 The most common sites of metastasis of an intestinal carcinoma are the lymph node, liver, lung, omentum, mesentery, spleen, bone, kidney, peritoneum (e.g., carcinomatosis), skin, and testes. 12, [55] [56] [57] [58] The third most commonly reported intestinal neoplasm in dogs is of smooth muscle lineage (leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma). [15] [16] [17] [59] [60] [61] A more recently reported variant of leiomyosarcoma and occasionally leiomyoma in dogs is the GI stromal tumor (GIST). 25, 62, 63 GISTs are generally more commonly noted in the large intestine, but are reported arising in the SI and stomach. On immunohistochemistry, GISTs are typically vimentin-positive, cytokeratin-negative, and CD117 (c-kit, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase)-positive, and have minimal expression of smooth muscle actin. CD117-positive tumors (e.g., GISTs) may have a lower metastatic rate than CD117-negative leiomyosarcomas. 25, 64 Less common tumors of the canine SI are carcinoid, mast cell tumor (the third most common intestinal tumor in the cat), extraskeletal osteosarcoma, ganglioneuroma, hemangiosarcoma, and extramedullary plasmacytoma. Carcinoids are of neuroendocrine origin and contain secretory granules comprising a variety of substances including gastrin, secretin, serotonin, and somatostatin. 10, 17, 65 Primary intestinal carcinoids are locally aggressive and commonly metastasize to the liver. 10, 66 Primary intestinal mast cell tumors are relatively common in cats, but rare in dogs.

            "text": "Small intestinal neoplastic masses may be palpable in approximately 20% to 50% of dogs and 50% to 85% of cats. 9, 12, 13, 23, 24, 45, 55, 76 Additional physical examination findings reported in dogs and cats with small intestinal neoplasia include dehydration, pain, and/or fever. 9, 24, 55 Small intestinal neoplasia occurs typically in older dogs (mean age: 6 to 10 years) and cats (mean age: 10 to 13 years). 2, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The mean age for feline alimentary lymphoma was younger when FeLV was more prevalent. [18] [19] [20] Although not significant, there is a slight male predisposition for canine intestinal tumors, 13, 15 but this is less clear in cats. 9, [21] [22] [23] Approximately 90% of dogs with GI lymphoma and 80% with leiomyoma/leiomyosarcoma are male. 16, 24, 25 Large breeds of dogs (e.g., German Shepherds, Collies) appear to be most at risk for small intestinal neoplasia, specifically adenocarcinoma, 14, 26 but leiomyosarcomas were reported to be rare in working military German Shepherd and Belgian Malinois dogs. 27 Siamese cats are consistently reported to be predisposed to intestinal lymphoma and adenocarcinoma, with one study suggesting an eightfold increased risk. 2, 9, 21, 28 There are no known chemical agents or microorganisms that are reliably associated with increased risk for intestinal neoplasia in dogs. The same is true for cats except for the clear associations with FeLV and feline immunodeficiency virus. [29] [30] [31] [32] Most cats with intestinal lymphoma are older and FeLV-negative by serology, but a significant portion of these cats are positive for FeLV by immunohistochemistry or PCR studies of the tumor tissue. 33 Of further note is the change in presentation of feline lymphoma that occurred in recent decades. When the prevalence of FeLV was high, the most common presentation of feline lymphoma was of cranial mediastinal and multicentric disease in young, FeLV-positive cats, whereas now the most common presentation is of an older, serologically FeLV-negative cat with alimentary lymphoma. 18, 34 The risk of gastric cancer is greatly increased in people with Helicobacter pylori infection, 35, 36 but this association has not been confirmed in dogs or cats to date. One domestic cat and a cougar were found to have concurrent Helicobacter infection and intestinal neoplasia (lymphoma in the domestic cat and intestinal adenocarcinoma in the cougar), but these studies do not allow for delineation of causation. 37, 38 Based on the lack of a large number of reported concurrent cases of Helicobacter and intestinal neoplasia in cats, in addition to the fact that some cats normally shed Helicobacter sp., this agent at present appears to play minimal to no role in the induction of feline intestinal neoplasia and may be part of the normal feline GI flora. 39, 40 ",

Unfortunately, endoscopy has potentially significant limitations depending on the anatomic site of the tumor and the ability of the endoscope to reach the affected area. The gross appearance of neoplasia on endoscopy can range from a mass effect, to reduced dispensability of an otherwise phenotypically normal area, to a \"cobblestone\" and/or focal erythremic effect. 76 An additional limitation to endoscopy is the size of the biopsy sample obtained, which can lead to significant interobserver variation in histopathologic interpretation. 80 One study of feline lymphoma compared endoscopic samples with fullthickness biopsy samples collected at laparotomy. In that investigation, lymphoma was diagnosed in 10 cats from full-thickness samples, but in only three cats with endoscopic samples. 81 For those cats with gastric lymphoma, endoscopic sampling diagnosed three of four cases, whereas in cats with intestinal lymphoma none of the six cats were diagnosed by endoscopic sampling. A similar study in dogs comparing endoscopic versus full-thickness sampling had comparable outcome. 24",

This reduced ability to delineate an abdominal mass on plain films in patients with lymphoma is likely caused by numerous factors including the potential for diffuse lesions and/or the presence of peritoneal effusion and/or other organ involvement. The frequency of obstructive patterns noted on plain films in dogs and cats with intestinal neoplasia varies between studies. Because of the advent of, and widespread use of, abdominal ultrasound, use of contrast radiography has waned in the last 5 to 10 years, but this technique will find filling defects in approximately 50% to 90% of dogs or cats with intestinal neoplasia. 9,24 Three-view thoracic radiographs should be performed as part of routine staging in any case with an abdominal mass or strong suspicion of an abdominal mass. As many intestinal tumors often do not metastasize to the lungs, this is typically a low-yield procedure when staging for small intestinal neoplasia. Nevertheless it should be performed as the presence of metastasis would signal a very significant change in prognosis and therapy.",

            "text": "The use of abdominal ultrasound has revolutionized the diagnosis of intestinal neoplasia. Abdominal ultrasound is a much more sensitive diagnostic tool than radiography for the identification of an intestinal mass 12, 13, 16, 26, 77 ; however, abdominal ultrasound alone is not diagnostic. The most frequent abdominal ultrasound changes noted in dogs and cats with intestinal neoplasia are loss of normal bowel wall layering and increased bowel wall thickness. Ninety-nine percent of dogs with intestinal neoplasia have loss of bowel wall layering, while 88% of dogs without intestinal neoplasia retain normal bowel wall layering. In addition, dogs with focal abdominal ultrasound lesions are approximately 20 times more likely to have neoplasia, and dogs with bowel thickness greater than 1 cm are at four times greater risk of neoplasia. 78 The advantages of abdominal ultrasound over plain and/or contrast radiography include (a) evaluation of other sites within the abdomen, (b) delineation of the presence or absence of carcinomatosis, (c) less time-consuming than contrast radiography, and (d) additional diagnostic utility gained through abdominal ultrasoundguided fine-needle aspirate or needle-core biopsy. 13, 26, 79 Other findings commonly reported with abdominal ultrasound in patients with small intestinal neoplasia include mixed echogenicity asymmetric lesions, diffusely thickened bowel loops, anechoic to hypoechoic mass lesions, and in patients with carcinomatosis, the presence of masses in the \"double-sheet\" region of the peritoneum where the parietal and visceral portions meet, and the presence of free fluid. 79 15% to 23% expression noted across two studies. 88, 89 In addition, p53 expression did not appear to correlate with the degree of malignancy of the tumors. COX-2 is commonly overexpressed in canine and feline small intestinal epithelial tumors and therefore the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents may represent a rational treatment approach in the primary setting with nonresectable disease or alternatively in an adjuvant setting. 90, 91 To date, the only nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with a documented in vivo antitumor effect is piroxicam. 92,93 I believe that from an evidence-based medicine perspective the lead NSAID for antitumor use should continue to be piroxicam until further in vivo studies with NSAIDs of improved safety profile become available.",

Survival greater than 1.5 years was reported in two dogs with intestinal adenocarcinoma after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. 13 A retrospective evaluation of adjuvant doxorubicin in cats with colonic adenocarcinoma reported a median survival time of approximately 9 months with doxorubicin versus 2 months without it. 11 It is unknown if similar results would be afforded in larger scale prospective trials of dogs or cats with small intestinal epithelial malignancies. Another study reported the use of chemotherapy in dogs with leiomyosarcoma to have variable outcome, with some dogs having long survival without chemotherapy after surgery. 16 Additional research is required to determine the usefulness of adjuvant chemotherapy in small intestinal nonlymphoid malignancies.",

Investigators have found a 12-day survival time in dogs not treated with surgery compared with survival ranging from 4 to 10 months (40% 1-year survival) when treated surgically. 12, 13, 55 Unfortunately, these poor survival times are most likely a result of a high metastatic rate. In dogs with intestinal epithelial malignancies, 40% to 50% metastasize to local lymph nodes, 30% to 40% metastasize to the liver, and approximately 10% to 20% metastasize to distant sites. 10, 12, 55 The importance of the presence of lymph node metastasis is further highlighted by a report documenting a median survival time of dogs treated with surgery of 15 months (67% survival at 1 year) compared with only 3 months (20% survival at 1 year) when lymph node metastases were present. 12 Similarly, male dogs with intestinal epithelial malignancies were reported to have prolonged survival time compared with females. 13 Differential expression levels of tenascin-C and vesicant are reported to occur between benign and malignant lesions in dogs, but these studies have not documented prognostic import within malignancies. 86, 87 p53 is the most commonly mutated tumor-suppressor gene in human oncology and overexpression is commonly associated with immunohistochemical overexpression. Overexpression of p53 is uncommon in canine small intestinal epithelial malignancies with with FeLV-positive cats treated with chemotherapy having a median survival time of 3 months versus 17 months if the cats were FeLVnegative (but this was only true in cats with early stage lymphoma and not significant in cats with later-stage neoplasia). 19 Another study reported the primary prognostic factors to be FeLV status, substage, and response to therapy, 34 but in other studies FeLV status was not prognostic. 51, 84 Immunophenotype is not of prognostic benefit in dogs or cats with intestinal lymphoma, but this may be a result of poor statistical power from small numbers of cases reported to date. 51 Labeling of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions is negatively correlated to clinical outcome in a variety of malignancies across species, but for feline alimentary lymphoma argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions were not associated with duration of remission, percentage of remission, or survival time. 95 Median remission for cats with intestinal large-cell lymphoma is 5 to 7 months, but subsets that are poorly understood to date can have extended survival times. 45, 84, 85 Other Feline Tumors Cats with duodenal polyps have an excellent prognosis.

The reverse holds in small animal medicine where small intestinal tumors are much more common than those of the large intestine. The reasons for this difference are unknown but likely to involve differences across the species related to diet, genetics, toxin exposures, and/or physiology. Risk factors noted to date for small intestinal epithelial neoplasia in humans includes increased intake of fatty foods, red meats, high-temperature grilled meats, and salt-cured food products. 96 Risk factors noted to date for small intestinal lymphoma include celiac disease which may progress from IBD to overt lymphoma. 97 Chronic use of COX-2 inhibitors reduces intestinal neoplasia in a variety of studies by approximately 50%. 98 Significant similarities across species are likely to exist in the potential use of COX-2 inhibitors for small intestinal epithelial tumors. Similarly, the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for GISTs across species is likely a result of the aforementioned commonly noted mutations in c-kit. 99 The principles of diagnosis and treatment are similar across species. Minor differences exist in the more common use of CT scanning for the diagnosis of small intestinal neoplasia in people compared with its current use in veterinary medicine. 100 The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in unresectable and/or metastatic GISTs in people is commonplace, suggesting that the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the same setting in dogs or cats may have potential utility. 99 There is a similar dearth of literature concerning the effectiveness of chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment setting for people with small intestinal epithelial malignancies. 101 ",
