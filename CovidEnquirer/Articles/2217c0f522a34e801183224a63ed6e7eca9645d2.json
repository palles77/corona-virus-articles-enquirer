Diagnostic algorithms have been developed for situations with no laboratory backup, an approach adopted, for example, in the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). Unfortunately, for many infections, clinical features lack sufficient specificity to allow them to be used to differentiate the possible diagnoses, and over-treatment to cover the various possibilities is common.",

            "text": "In the assessment of the febrile child in the tropics, for example, malaria and systemic bacterial infections often have an indistinguishable clinical picture. Malaria may be diagnosed by smear microscopy, but bloodstream infections require a blood culture service. It has become clear in recent years that bloodstream infections represent an underappreciated burden of disease and mortality. This was clearly demonstrated by a study conducted in Kenya in which bacterial bloodstream infections diagnosed by blood culture were responsible for 26% of deaths among children admitted to a rural district hospital. 1 Without an accurate diagnosis and specific treatment, bloodstream infections such as those due to Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Burkholderia pseudomallei can carry a high mortality. Distinguishing cerebral malaria, bacterial meningitis, and encephalopathic typhoid may be similarly difficult without laboratory support. Children in sub-Saharan Africa with clinical symptoms of pneumonia may have pneumococcal pneumonia but can equally have malaria or invasive salmonellosis. A child with dysentery may be suffering from amebic colitis, Shigella infection, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. In adults, syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections is widespread but needs to be informed by periodic surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Emerging and potentially epidemic viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza (H5N1 and H1N1), Ebola, and Zika require relatively sophisticated tests to confirm the diagnosis. 2 Infections by pathogens that are resistant to multiple antimicrobials are common in many tropical countries where there is widespread availability of over-the-counter antimicrobials. Appropriate therapy of these infections requires isolation of the causative organism and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. 3 Laboratories also have an important public health role within the health care system. The ability to investigate outbreaks of disease as part of epidemic preparedness is a key function. These might include outbreaks of watery or bloody diarrhea, epidemics of meningitis, or clusters of patients with fever of unknown etiology. In addition, laboratories are a critical component of disease control programs such as the national programs for the control of tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria. The lack of laboratory capacity to support the expansion of diagnostic testing and antiretroviral therapy in HIV programs and in disease outbreaks such as Ebola has made many international organizations appreciate the desperate plight of the laboratory service for the first time. 2 Tuberculosis can be diagnosed in many patients with a Ziehl-Neelsen-stained smear of sputum, but to extend the diagnosis in those who are acid-fast bacilli (AFB) negative or have multi-drug-resistant (MDR) disease requires more developed laboratory support. Furthermore, laboratories have an increasing role in infection control in health care settings and congregate facilities and in the prevention of health care-associated infections.",

Disease identification, appropriate treatment choice, and implementing public health measures for the prevention and control of endemic and epidemic infections all require laboratory support. This lack of reliable diagnostics compromises patient care.

It is standard practice in tuberculosis programs that patients who fail treatment should have a sample cultured for tuberculosis so that susceptibility tests can be performed. In a study of the transport of such specimens to the central reference laboratory in Malawi, only 40% of specimens arrived in the reference laboratory and only 36% of those samples received were successfully cultured for susceptibility testing. 5 The shortage of staff with appropriate education and training is a further problem. Many laboratory workers have no formal training and are simply trained at the bench. At the peripheral level, there may be only one laboratory assistant, with no more than secondary school education. At the district level, there may be assistants and technicians (formally educated in laboratory medicine for 3 years). At the central level, technicians may work alongside technologists (with 2 years specialist post-technician training) and scientists (university science graduates). Regardless of qualifications, laboratory workers often have a lowly status within the health sector, and the attrition of health care personnel out of government service results in low morale among those who remain. Private or research laboratories may attract the best technicians from the government sector. Diagnostic laboratories frequently have no representation at the local, provincial, or national level, or, if they do, it is only as part of the support services. In many countries, the voice of the laboratory is rarely heard. These many problems contribute to a poor biosafety situation in laboratories. The lack of equipment, knowledge, and training means that laboratory workers are processing samples with hazardous pathogens in an unsafe manner. In a study of tuberculosis laboratories in Korea, before safety conditions had been upgraded, the relative risk of being diagnosed with tuberculosis for the technicians performing drug susceptibility tests was 21.5 (95% CI 4.5-102.5) compared with non-laboratory workers. 6 The true magnitude of this problem in laboratory workers is difficult to gauge because surveillance of infection in laboratory workers is rarely performed or reported.",

A representative of the laboratory services should be present in the key decision-making committees. Support is also needed from clinicians, who often have disproportionate influence within the system. A plan for the laboratory network should become part of the overall health care development plan. There needs to be a priority list of core and essential services provided in a qualityassured manner. The laboratory plan should include the provision for a tiered laboratory network at the primary, district, regional/ provincial, and national levels. The plans should be realistic, affordable, and sustainable. At the Level I or primary level, perhaps in a health post or health center serving outpatients, microscopy for malaria and tuberculosis and testing for HIV with a same-day service would be essential. These laboratories can serve as a collection point for samples that need referral to the next level. The Level II facility in the local district hospital would have a dedicated laboratory space and a broader repertoire of tests serving inpatients and outpatients. The tests offered would depend on the spectrum of local diseases and resources available, and may be limited to microscopy, simple biochemistry and serology, and blood transfusion, or may include bacterial culture facilities. Laboratories can act as a hub for the primary-level laboratories, providing them with support, supplies of reagents, and QA activities. At the Level III, define clinical problems by sampling surveys. For example, determining the antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens such as S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. enterica for a selection of isolates can inform the appropriate empiric therapy in a particular area. An understanding of the burden of disease in an area-drugresistant typhoid in an urban slum, for example-could lead to public health measures such as a vaccination program. Laboratory surveillance programs may produce the clue to the possibility of new organisms emerging, including both bacteria and viruses, most commonly at the animal-human interface.",

Even basic equipment required for a functioning laboratory can be in disrepair because of the absence of regular care and servicing. A functioning microscope is a key piece of equipment for a basic microbiology laboratory but is frequently found in poor condition. In a survey of 90 microscopes in laboratories in nine districts in Malawi, only 50% were in good condition. 4 There were 1.1 functioning microscopes per 100,000 population, and even microscopes in need of full servicing were still in daily use. The 90 microscopes were from 16 different manufacturers, illustrating the lack of standardization of laboratory equipment so frequently seen. The provision of biological safety cabinets is another area where equipment from multiple manufacturers and lack of spare parts and maintenance are common, and in this case may lead to unsafe and hazardous conditions for laboratory workers. Standardization of equipment and consumables with central ordering, maintenance contracts, and supplies of spare parts would seem a sensible response to this issue but is rarely seen. Tests may also be unavailable because of an inadequate supply route for consumables. This is another area where standardization of tests and central ordering and supply can lead not only to more reliable supply of quality-assured consumables but also to potential cost savings for the country.",

More specialized laboratories such as tuberculosis reference laboratories where culture and susceptibility testing are performed require BSL3 facilities. BSL3 laboratories have particular design features to reduce the hazard of airborne transmission and incorporate directional airflows and the use of biological safety cabinets. They are particularly appropriate for laboratories handling pathogens such as tuberculosis and influenza. However, BSL3 facilities are very expensive and difficult to build and maintain. The WHO has recently indicated that in some circumstances, slightly less rigorous guidelines, so-called BSL2+ as outlined in Table 21 .2, may be appropriate for selected laboratories, for example, processing samples for tuberculosis culture. 8",

Line probe assays (LPAs) use a multiplex PCR amplification followed by reverse hybridization to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and mutations in the genes associated with at risk of infection, sensitive and specific, user friendly (simple to perform and requiring minimal training), rapid (to enable treatment at the first visit), robust (does not require refrigerated storage), equipment-free, and able to be delivered to those who need it. There has been increased attention on the problem of antimicrobial resistance for many important pathogens and the critical role that the laboratory plays in the management of this. Initiatives have focused on methods and systems of surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial infections that countries can readily implement. 3, 12 The WHO guideline has recommended a focus on eight priority pathogens as described in the Global Antimicrobial rifampicin and isoniazid resistance. LPA can be performed with results in 1 to 2 days, which is considerably quicker than the weeks required for traditional culture methods, and the overall agreement for the diagnosis of MDR between these tests and conventional methods is 99%. The format of these tests is being simplified so that the feasibility of their routine use in tuberculosis reference laboratories in developing countries is becoming a reality. These methods are an important component of the roll-out of the programmatic management of MDR tuberculosis globally.",
