By means of both nasal washings and pharyngeal swabs, enrolled children were checked for 14 respiratory viruses. The majority of acute respiratory infections resulted from viral pathogens (135/231, 58%). Overall, the most common was respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), in 64% of positive samples; A/H1N1/2009 was the only influenza virus found in 16% and rhinovirus (RV) in 15%. Virus-positive children did not differ significantly from virus-negative children in signs and symptoms at presentation; of the virus groups, RSV-infected children were younger and more frequently admitted to intensive-care units than those infected with A/H1N1/2009 and RV. Of the hospitalized children, stratified by age, both infants and children aged >1 year with RSV were most severely affected, whereas A/H1N1/2009 infections were the mildest overall, although with related pulmonary involvement in older children. Children with RV infections, detected in two flares partially overlapping with the A/H1N1/2009 and RSV peaks, presented with bronchiolitis, wheezing and pneumonia. Leukocytosis occurred more frequently in RV-infected and A/H1N1/2009-infected children, and numbers of blood eosinophils were significantly elevated in RV-infected infants. Given the fact that clinical and epidemiological criteria are not sufficient to identify viral respiratory infections, a timely virological diagnosis could allow different infections to be managed separately.",

Diagnosis of influenza virus infections, as with other respiratory pathogens, is usually based on clinical and epide-miological criteria, and is only rarely confirmed virologically [2] . However, lack of an aetiological diagnosis could hamper efforts to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission and the efficient use of the proper antiviral drugs. In order to evaluate the relative impact of a novel virus, laboratory-confirmed data are needed on hospitalization rates for and clinical courses of respiratory viral infections.",

Exclusion criteria were underlying chronic diseases (including cystic fibrosis, chronic pulmonary disease, congenital heart disease, and immunodeficiency). Informed consent was sought from the children's parents for them to participate in the study, which had been approved by the hospital's Ethics Committee. To ensure accurate virological diagnosis, two respiratory specimens-a pharyngeal swab (PS) (Virocult; Medical Wire and Equipment, Corsham, UK) and a nasal washing (NW) (3 mL of sterile saline solution injected into each nostril and collected with a syringe)-were taken during ED consultation from enrolled children, whether subsequently hospitalized or not. Detailed demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the patients' medical files. A severity score ranging from 0 to 8 was assigned according to respiratory rate (age-adjusted), arterial oxygen saturation in room air (0, >95%; 1, 95-90%; 2, <90%), the presence of retractions (0, none; 1, present;; 2, present + nasal flare), and ability to feed (0, normal; 1, reduced; 2, intravenous) [6] .",

NW samples were vortexed to shear mucus, and divided into three aliquots, one of which was used for RNA extraction as described above.

For blood cell counts, several statistically significant differences between virus groups were found. Among children aged \u00a31 year, those infected with RV presented with leukocytosis (defined as white blood cell (WBC) counts >15 000/mm 3 ) and elevated lymphocyte and eosinophil counts as compared with those infected with RSV; as compared with the RSV group, the A/H1N1/2009 group presented only with significantly higher lymphocyte counts. In children aged >1 year, the total WBC and neutrophil counts were elevated in RV cases, at a statistically significant level, as compared with patients infected with RSV only, but three RV patients probably had a concomitant bacterial infection, having WBC counts >15 000/mm 3 and C-reactive protein levels of approximately 9 mg/mL. The main discharge clinical diagnoses are presented in Table 4 , distributed by respiratory virus results. Bronchiolitis (defined as a history of upper respiratory tract infection followed by acute onset of respiratory distress with cough, tachypnoea, retraction and diffuse crackles on auscultation in infants within 1 year) was the most frequent clinical diagnosis, and 49% of these cases were RSV single infections; the second most frequent single agent was RV (7%), whereas 16% of bronchiolitis cases were infected with other viruses or co-infected; no viruses were found in the remaining cases. Pneumonia was the second most frequent clinical diagnosis, and RSV was the most frequent viral pathogen found (47% of virus-positive cases). It is noteworthy that 7/8 children aged >1 year affected with A/H1N1/2009 were diagnosed with pneumonia.",

Thus, although RV showed a tendency to circulate at the end of either the A/ H1N1/2009 or RSV peaks, RV infections also occurred at the same time as infections with the two major respiratory viruses, A/H1N1/2009 and RSV, and presented a rate of coinfections (20% of positive samples) consistent with previous reports [16, 17] . Interestingly, in this study, A/H1N1/2009 occurred as a single infection, whereas RSV presented with a low frequency of co-infection (7%). The relatively low rate of mixed respiratory virus infections (only about 4% of the total number of samples) and the low percentages of detection of PIV1, PIV3 and hMPV found in this study as compared with our previous studies [7, 8] , in which the same RT-PCR reactions were used, could be explained by the unusual prevalence of an influenza A virus, A/H1N1/2009, in October-November. In fact, several papers [18] [19] [20] have reported changes in respiratory virus circulation in the past season, and suggested, as a possible explanation, that the activation of innate immunity resulting from a respiratory infection would prevent superinfection with other respiratory pathogens [21] ; further studies are needed to investigate this possibility.",

The rate of A/H1N1/2009 pneumonia diagnosis found in this study is consistent with previous reports of A/H1N1/2009 pulmonary replication greater than that expected from a seasonal influenza virus [5, 27] . It has been suggested that the greater rate of pneumonia might perhaps differentiate A/ H1N1/2009 from seasonal influenza [4] ; however, this criterion will not help to discriminate it from other respiratory virus infections, as pneumonia, being a clinical diagnosis, is not suggestive of a specific viral infection.",

Even though specific antiviral drugs are currently used only in cases of influenza virus infection, the usefulness of proper treatment against RSV and RV infections in infants would be improved by the use of virological molecular diagnosis. As an example, even though treatment with systemic corticosteroids is not recommended in cases of RSV infection, it has been reported that administration of prednisolone to hospitalized children with first episodes of wheezing associated with RV infection reduces the frequency of relapse [28] .",

Considering the fact that clinical presentation is not useful in discriminating between viral pathogens, a timely virological diagnosis is essential in order to separate infected patients during pandemic alerts or at-risk children, and in order to prescribe specific treatments for influenza A virus, RSV and RV infections.",
