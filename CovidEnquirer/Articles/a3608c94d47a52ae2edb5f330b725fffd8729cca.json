Full-length and truncated versions of rat TGN38/41 have been expressed in monkey (COS) and human (Heb7a) cells under the control of the heavy metal inducible Metallothionein IIA promoter. This has allowed the regulated expression of TGN38/41 protein constructs to different levels in the transfected cells. These studies show that (i) controlled overexpression of TGN38/41 results in mislocalisation to parts of the endocytic pathway, (ii) a truncated version of TGN38/41, lacking the cytoplasmic domain, remains in the TGN, and (iii) there is a direct or indirect interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38/41 and y-adaptin.",

            "text": "The trans-Golgi network (TGN) acts as a sorting centre for proteins destined for the plasma membrane, lysosomes and regulated secretory granules and has been shown to be an organelle independent of the Golgi stack [1, 2] . TGN38 and TGN41 are two isoforms of a type I integral membrane protein which has been localized to this compartment [3, 4] . Although TGN38/41 is concentrated in the TGN it also recycles between the TGN and the plasma membrane [5, 6] . Localization signals for the TGN have recently been investigated in four separate studies [7] [8] [9] [10] using both chimeric proteins and deletion or point mutations of TGN38/41. A role for the cytoplasmic domain in either targetting or retention was implicated by transient transfection studies [3] in which overexpression of TGN38 or deletion of the cytoplasmic domain resulted in mislocalization to the cell surface. Transient transfectants expressing both chimeric constructs using the lumenal domain of the LDL receptor attached to the cytoplasmic tail of TGN38 as well as deletion and point mutations in the wild type TGN38 sequence [8] have been used to probe the exact sequences necessary for TGN localization. In addition, stable cell lines expressing the lumenal and transmembrane domains of either the Tac antigen [7] or glycophorin A [9] attached to the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38 gave similar results. All three studies identified the sequence *Corresponding author. Fax: (44) 272 288274. YQRL, in particular the tyrosine and leucine residues, in the cytoplasmic tail as being important for targetting to the TGN and retreival from the plasma membrane. Wong and Hong [9] also identified a serine residue close to the tyrosine (SDYQRL) as an additional requirement for TGN localization, whilst Humphrey et al. found that mutation of arginine to glutamic acid in the YQRL sequence resulted in efficient internalization, but not TGN localization. This suggests that the specificity of localization signals may be contained within individual members of the generic tyrosine-containing internalization motif. This is discussed elsewhere [11, 12] . Experiments using other chimeric proteins have recently shown that the transmembrane domain of TGN38/41 plays a role in retention within the TGN [10] .",

Overexpression of wild-type and chimeric proteins containing the proposed localization signal for TGN38 resulted in mislocalization to the plasma membrane and vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm [3, 7, 9] suggesting that the mechanism for retention and/or targetting is saturable. In order to investigate this further we have isolated stably transfected cell lines incorporating an inducible expression system whereby the expression of TGN38/41 can be increased incrementally. We have used this system to monitor the subcellular distribution of both wild type TGN38/41 and TGN38/41 lacking a cytoplasmic domain.",

In order to alleviate the problem of overexpression in interpreting results of mutagenesis experi- ments designed to identify TGN localisation signals, we sought to establish stable inducible cell lines expressing rat TGN38 or rat TGN41, Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are available which recognise rat but not human or monkey TGN38/41 [15, 21] . Monkey (COS) and human (Heb7a) cells were transfected by electroporation with pMEP4 constructs encoding either rat TGN38 or TGN41. In each case the relevant cDNA was cloned downstream of the human metallothionein IIA promoter to allow inducible expression by addition of CdC12 to the tissue culture medium. Stable cell lines were isolated as described in section 2. Clonal COS cell lines expressing TGN41 (as assayed by immunofluorescence analysis using anti TGN38/41 antibodies) were isolated. All showed a similar pattern in the immunofluorescence screen and one, COS41-1 was chosen for further study. Cells were treated with 0-20 gM CdC12 for 20 h prior to processing for immunofluorescence analysis. A monoclonal antibody raised to the N-terminal 13 amino acids of rat TGN38/41 fails to recognise the endogenous simian protein thus allowing detection of rat proteins encoded by the transgene. There was some TGN41 expression without any added CdC12 ( Fig. 2A) , however, increasing doses resulted in a corresponding increase in intensity of TGN41 staining (Fig. 2B-F) . At low doses, 1.25 and 2.5/zM CdCI2, the pattern of staining resembles that seen for the endogenous protein in NRK cells [1] (Fig. 2B,C) , i.e. a tight perinuclear concentration. As is the case for the endogenous rat protein, the transfected cells varied in terms of the reticular versus vesicular nature of this staining. At 5/IM CdC12 the pattern is similar, however, the intensity of staining is increased (Fig.  2D ). Starting at 10/tM CdC12 and becoming more pronounced at 20/tM CdC12, not only does the intensity increase but the pattern of staining no longer resembles the tight pattern of staining seen at lower doses (Fig.  2E,F) . A number of different morphologies are present, the most common being a disruption of the concentrated staining around the nucleus accompanied by large and small vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm and in some cells the appearance of TGN41 at the cell surface. In some cases a large reticular network extending throughout the cell can also be seen (data not shown). 20/zM CdC12 has no effect on TGN morphology or the intracellular distribution of either rat TGN38/41 in NRK cells or of the simian TGN38/41 in COS ceils (data not shown). These criteria were assayed in COS cells using an antibody which recognises the endogenous protein in these cells [14] . This dose of CdCI2 has previously been shown to have no detectable toxic effects in cells in tissue culture during the time course of the experiment described [23] .",

The results are presented in Fig. 3.

Quantitation by densitometry revealed a 10-fold increase in TGN41 expression in cells treated with 20/zM CdCI2 compared to untreated cells. Thus, the tendency for apparent mislocalisation of TGN41 correlates with a 10-fold increase in protein expression. Similar results were obtained with (i) other clonal permanent COS transfectants expressing TGN41 (ii) permanent COS transfectants expressing TGN38 and (iii) clonal permanent Heb7a transfectants expressing either TGN38 or TGN41.",

Double-labelling immunofluorescence experiments were performed using a species-specific polyclonal anti-rat TGN38/41 antibody and a monoclonal antibody to human 7/-adaptin [16] which also recognises simian 7/-adaptin. This was in order to confirm that rat TGN41 expressed in transfected COS cells co-localised with the endogenous 7/adaptin and was therefore correctly localised to the TGN. COS41-1 cells were treated with either 2.5/tM or 20/.tM CdCI 2 and processed for immunofluorescence as described. At low doses of cadmium TGN41 and 7/adaptin colocalise to the same perinuclear location (Fig.  4A,B) . It is of note that at higher doses of cadmium, when TGN41 expression is elevated and the protein can be detected in diverse vesicles as opposed to the original perinuclear location, the pattern of anti-y-adaptin staining is altered in a similar manner (Fig. 4C,D) . These data could be interpreted to suggest that overexpression of TGN41 leads to an expansion of the TGN rather than its mislocalisation to other compartments. This would imply that TGN41 plays a pivotal role in defining the TGN as being the TGN. Alternatively they might be interpreted to show that there is a direct or indirect interaction between TGN41 and y-adaptin, so that when TGN41 is present in significant amounts in extra-TGN structures those structures become coated with 7/adaptin. The following experiments were performed in order to help address these points.",

This indicated that, at this level of expression, rat TGN41 is appropriately localised in transfected COS cells. However, at higher doses of cadmium, in addition to the concentration of staining at the MTOC, vesicles are also seen dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.  4F) .

As can be seen in Fig. 6A -C there was no significant difference between the three samples.

These data suggest that TGN41 is not accumulating at the cell surface at the levels of expression which cause its intracellular mislocalisation.

A number of reports, using various constructs and expression systems, have demonstrated that deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38/41 results in its expression at the cell surface [3, 7, 8, 9] . The original description [3] was of transiently transfected cells which expressed recombinant protein at very high levels. This system has been modified to give slightly lower levels of expression [8] . The other two studies [7, 9] used the lumenal and transmembrane domains of other cell surface reporter proteins attached to the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38/41. In all the above studies, levels of transgene expression were unregulated, and significantly higher than those for endogenous TGN38141 in rat cells. Since our studies with full-length rat TGN41 expressed in COS cells had shown that over-expression of the protein led to its mislocalisation, we chose to ask whether the level of protein expression affected the localisation of a truncated TGN38/41 molecule lacking the majority of the cytoplasmic domain. To address this question Heb7a cells were transfected with a pMEP4-TGN38141 cyto-plasmic domain deletion construct (TGN38/41 A TAIL in Fig. 1 ) and stably expressing cell lines established. One cell line designated HebATail-3 was chosen for further study, however, the same results were obtained with other cell lines. HebATail-3 cells were treated with 2.5 or 20 /tM CdCI 2 and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody to the N-terminus of TGN38/41. Cell surface staining was apparent at low doses of CdC12 (Fig. 7A) . The intensity of this staining increased with increasing expression levels obtained by treatment with higher doses of CdC12 (Fig. 7A,B) . Interestingly, in addition to the cell surface staining a concentration of staining in the perinuclear area was also visualised at both high and low levels of expression (Fig.  7A,B) . The increase in level of expression at the cell surface was confirmed by FACS analysis (Fig. 6D,E) of HebATail-3 cells. A 10-fold increase in CdCI2 leading to a 10-fold increase in cell surface expression.",

The perinuclear concentration of TGN38/41 staining colocalised with the 7-adaptin staining (Fig. 7C,D) suggesting that some of the mutant protein was located in the TGN.

In some cells it was completely absent from its normally perinuclear localisation and only present in the vesicular structures. Interestingly, in cells overexpressing TGN41, where TGN41 is present in a diverse array of structures, 7-adaptin is also present on the majority of those structures. This might imply that overexpression of TGN41 leads to an expansion of the TGN and hence expansion of the membrane area coated with 7-adaptin. However, many of the TGN41-containing structures observed in transfectants overexpressing TGN41 correspond to early endosomes (as ascertained by the colocalisation between internalised FITC-transferrin and TGN41; Fig. 5A,B) . TGN38/41 has previously been shown to recycle between the cell surface and the TGN [5, 6] , with a steady state distribution whereby the majority of the protein is in the TGN. These data suggest that overexpression of TGN41 disturbs the equillibrium of this steady state distribution such that accumulation occurs along the endocytic pathway rather than in the TGN. The fact that 7-adaptin is apparently associated with these endocytic structures (Fig. 4C,D) implies some direct or indirect interaction between TGN41 and 7adaptin, and the fact that overexpression of A TAIL TGN38/41 fails to lead to mislocalisation of 7-adaptin implicates the cytoplasmic domain of TGN38/41 in any such interaction. This is of note given the data which argue that TGN38/41 is required for vesicle formation from the TGN [26] .",

The reason for the difference in these results is not clear, however, it could be due to the levels of expression and/or transfection systems used. The levels of cell surface expression observed in immunofluorescence analysis in the earlier studies were high enough to have masked any intracellular concentration of fluorescence signal. The lower levels of recombinant protein expression obtained in this study permitted the detection of intracellular staining patterns in immunofluorescence analysis even in the presence of cell surface protein expression. There is precedence for different results being obtained from transient and permanent transfection systems since it has been proposed that two contradictory sets of results regarding regions of the protein responsible for the targeting of the glucose transporter GLUT4 [27, 28] were obtained due to one being a stable expression system and the other a transient system [29] .",

The residual TGN38/41 present in the TGN, was apparent even at the highest levels of induction (Fig. 7) . These data parallel those seen for many of the Golgi enzymes in that, even at expression levels several hundred-fold higher than normal, the retention system could not be saturated (reviewed in [30] ). We have not determined whether it is the lumenal domain or transmembrane domain that is responsible for this retention, however, precedence in terms of the Golgi enzymes would suggest it may be the transmembrane domain and work by others has recently demonstrated that this is the case [10] .",

            "text": "The length of the transmembrane domain has recently been put forward as a possible determining factor in retention/residence in the Golgi stacks or plasma membrane [31] . The average length of the hydrophobic domain in 17 type II plasma membrane proteins was 20 amino acids versus 15 for Golgi enzymes. Analysis of the composition of amino acids in this domain also revealed a preference for phenylalanine in the Golgi enzymes. This is consistent with the finding that polar residues are required on one face of a predicted s-helix in the transmembrane domain of El glycoprotein of avian coronavirus for its retention in the Golgi [32] . The transmembrane domain of TGN38/41 is 21 amino acids in length but contains two phenylalanine residues. This may be consistent with its role in recycling between the TGN and the plasma membrane, needing the length to allow incorporation upon arrival at the cell surface but also requiring some of the properties of the Golgi enzymes which would enable residence in the 'more disordered' environment of the lipid bilayer of the TGN. The regulated expression system we have described and characterised will permit a detailed analysis, at physiologically relevant levels of expression, of sequence/ structural motifs involved in TGN to plasma membrane recycling pathways.",
