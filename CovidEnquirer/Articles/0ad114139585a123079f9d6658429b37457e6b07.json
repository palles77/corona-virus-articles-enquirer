Here we show that ACE2 expression on cell lines correlates with susceptibility to SARS-CoV S-driven infection, suggesting that ACE2 is a major receptor for SARS-CoV. The soluble ectodomain of ACE2 specifically abrogated S-mediated infection and might therefore be exploited for the generation of inhibitors. Deletion of a major portion of the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 had no effect on S-driven infection, indicating that this domain is not important for receptor function. Our results point to a central role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infection and suggest a minor contribution of the cytoplasmic domain to receptor function.",

The SARS associated CoV (SARS-CoV) exhibits a genome organization similar to those of known CoVs [4] [5] [6] , however, sequence analysis indicates that SARS-CoV does not cluster with known coronaviruses, but either constitutes a new branch [4, 5] or a subgroup of class II CoVs [7, 8] . Recent reports demonstrated that the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV is sufficient to drive infection of cells and can be recognized by neutralizing antibodies in SARS patients [9] [10] [11] . Because of its essential role in viral entry, SARS-CoV S is an attractive target for vaccines and antiviral compounds. Indeed, immunization of mice with a S-based DNA vaccine triggered humoral and cellular immune responses and protected animals from SARS-CoV infection [12] . Moreover, a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV S has been shown to potently inhibit SARS-CoV infection and could be employed for first line therapy [13] .",

Li et al. [15] identified the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV. ACE2 expression on non-permissive cells confers susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection [11] , indicating that ACE2 is sufficient to allow viral entry. The receptor-binding domain in SARS-CoV S has been mapped to amino acids 318-510, and efforts to identify regions in ACE2 contacted by S are underway [13, [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, it is unclear if ACE2 is the only receptor for SARS-CoV or if entry into certain tissues and organs like liver and kidney is facilitated by other receptors. Moreover, it is unknown whether the ACE2 ectodomain can be used to modulate S-driven infection; if so, the development of inhibitors mimicking the S-interaction domain in ACE2 might be justified. Finally, it needs to be determined if SARS-CoV S-binding to ACE2 triggers intracellular signaling events essential for infection. Here, we analyzed the interaction between S and ACE2 employing lentiviral particles bearing the SARS-CoV S-protein. These particles, so called pseudotypes, infect target cells in a S-dependent manner and can be used to analyze S-function under standard biosafety conditions [9] [10] [11] .",

We anticipated that pre-incubation of virions with soluble ACE2 might block binding of SARS-CoV S to membrane bound ACE2, since it has been shown that soluble ACE2 blocks the attachment of a S-immunoglobulin fusion protein to permissive Vero E6 cells [15] . Alternatively, pre-coating of virions with soluble receptor could activate the fusogenic activity in SARS-CoV S and facilitate infection of target cells. To obtain soluble ACE2, a stop codon was introduced at position 740 of the ACE2 coding sequence, resulting in a truncated reading frame encoding the entire ectodomain as previously described [21] . Transfection of 293T cells with the plasmid encoding soluble ACE2 resulted in efficient release of the protein into the supernatant, while no soluble protein was detected in supernatants of cells transfected with wild type ACE2 (Fig. 2A) . The supernatant containing soluble ACE2 was concentrated by filtration through an ultrafilter with a 30 kDa molecular weight cut-off (CentriconPLUS80) and employed for inhibition studies (Fig. 2B ). Viral pseudotypes bearing SARS-CoV S or VSV-G were standardized for comparable production of luciferase upon infection of target cells, incubated with or refractory ()) to SARS-CoV infection. Total RNA was isolated from the indicated cell lines followed by reverse transcription. Subsequently, a nested PCR with ACE2-specific oligonucleotides was performed using either the resulting cDNAs as templates (middle panel, +RT) or employing the input RNA (upper panel, )RT). As a control, all cDNAs were subjected to a PCR with GAPDH-specific oligonucleotides (lower panel). (B) Enhanced SARS-CoV S-mediated entry into 293T cells transiently over-expressing ACE2. ACE2 of human (hu) and African green monkey (agm) origin or human CD13 were transiently expressed in 293T cells followed by infection with SARS-CoV S-pseudotypes carrying a luciferase reporter gene. After 72 h, cells were lysed and luciferase activity was determined in the cell extracts. Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate and repeated at least three times with independent virus stocks. the indicated dilutions of supernatant containing soluble ACE2, and used for infection of 293T cells. The soluble ACE2 containing supernatant blocked SARS-CoV Sdriven infection in a dose-dependent manner, but did not appreciably modulate VSV-G-and MLV-glycoprotein-mediated infection (Fig. 2B and data not  shown) , indicating that the ACE2 ectodomain and possibly portions thereof can be used to specifically block SARS-CoV S-driven infection.",

Thus, the development of compounds that block binding of SARS-CoV S to ACE2 without inhibiting the natural function of ACE2 is now a desirable goal. For these strategies to be successful, however, it needs to be determined if ACE2 is the only receptor for SARS-CoV. This is especially important in the light of recent findings demonstrating that SARS-CoV cell tropism is broader than initially appreciated [9, 10] . Here, we analyzed several cell lines of known permissiveness to SARS-CoV S-mediated infection for expression of ACE2 messenger RNA (mRNA). Expression of ACE2 mRNA correlated with permissiveness to infection for all cell lines examined, indicating that ACE2 plays a central role in SARS-CoV infection. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that alternative receptors promote viral entry into certain cell types and tissues.",

            "text": "Evidence obtained with other viruses indicates that incubation with soluble receptors can modulate infection. For example, a tetrameric form of the HIV receptor CD4 potently abrogates HIV-1 infection, and this effect is recapitulated to some degree by a 27 amino acid comprising CD4 mimicking synthetic peptide [22, 23] . In our hands, the soluble ACE2 ectodomain specifically blocked infection by SARS-CoV S-bearing pseudotypes. This validates the receptor-binding site in S as a therapeutic target, although the development of therapeutics based on the ACE2 ectodomain is going to be challenging. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to examine if smaller portions of the ACE2 ectodomain exhibit inhibitory activity. Finally, the solution of the structure of S bound to ACE2 must provide the basis for the rational design of compounds that target residues in S contacted by ACE2.",

            "text": "Binding of SARS-CoV S to ACE2 could induce intracellular signaling which might be required for receptor function. Indeed, the cytoplasmic domain of ACE2 contains consensus sites for kinases, suggesting an interaction of this domain with cellular proteins involved in signal transduction. Moreover, the ACE2 cytoplasmic domain could be involved in internalization, which seems to be required for S-driven infection [9, 10] . However, large deletions in the ACE2 cytoplasmic tail did not appreciably modulate expression and receptor function, at least in the context of 293T cells over-expressing receptor (Fig. 3C) . These data argue against an important role of the ACE2 cytoplasmic domain in mediating SARS-CoV S-driven infection, albeit different cellular backgrounds need to be examined. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that the minimal sequences still remaining in the cytoplasmic tail of the ACE2 deletion-variants examined play a role in signaling or internalization. However, the introduction of larger deletions abrogated surface but not intracellular expression (data not shown) of the receptor, suggesting that sequences between amino acids 766 and 771 are required for the insertion of ACE2 into the plasma membrane.",
