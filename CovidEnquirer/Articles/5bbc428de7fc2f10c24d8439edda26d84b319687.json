In this study, infectious period is defined as the time difference between date of infection and date of diagnosis as there is strong evidence showing that a diseased individual remains contagious even during the incubation period, and would be immediately isolated upon positive diagnosis hence losing the transmissibility.

We can see that some serial intervals are negative which is certainly impossible by definition. However, noting that the serial intervals were approximated from the dates of symptoms onset, this suggests that the negative values could be caused by different lengths of incubation period between individuals. Here a simple correction is implemented by resetting the negative values to zeros. This shifts the average of the serial intervals to 4.41 days and the standard deviation to 3.17 days after corrections, see table 1. Note that the serial interval of SARS-nCoV in Hongkong was 8.4 days on average. 3 In addition, a total of 67 cases in the collected data were able to identify the corresponding dates of infection.

Since January 19, 2020, various containment measures have been strictly implemented, especially after the State Council agreed to include NCP into the Management of the Infectious Diseases Law and the Health and Quarantine Law on January 20. Based on an average10.91-day infectious period estimate from our collected data, we expect a flatter rate of increment starting on January 29. Figure 3 plots the number of daily new cases in a log-scale against date, and, as anticipated, the trend supports our guess. Therefore, the quantities \u0734 and \u0734 are estimated based on collected data in two separate periods, i.e., from January 21 (the starting date of daily updates of confirmed cases .

Table 3 and Table 4 . Despite the disagreement between different estimation methods, all three methods indicate notable reductions from \u0734 to \u0734 which suggests an improvement in the current situation. This is possibly due to the effective interventions and prompt actions by the local and central governments to minimize further spreading. We also notice that EGR yields smaller estimates of \u0734 compared to other methods. This might be because the number of infected patients does not grow exponentially after such strict containment measures. ",

However, during the period of data collection, the official guidelines for diagnosis and treatment were updated four times. The criteria of confirmation have evolved from the original \"whole genome sequencing of the respiratory excretion\" to \"positive viral nucleic acid results by the RT-PCR of the respiratory excretion or viral gene sequence\", and, most currently, the inclusion of positive nucleic acid results of the blood sample. In the meanwhile, the confirmation process is simplified by removing the accreditation process by the national expert committee for confirmed cases. The fourth edition granted the accrediting authority to the municipalities. 11 In addition, the medical resources in Hubei Province especially in Wuhan have been enhanced remarkably. All of these changes might result in a temporary surge of confirmed cases and lead to an overestimation of \u0734 , especially in Hubei Province. .
