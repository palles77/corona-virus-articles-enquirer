Elements of plans and the parties with a role in their creation and implementation are then examined, followed by some comments about the future and directions for further research. Case studies are devoted to a tourism crisis management plan and an interesting example of one company's endeavors to manage the dual challenge of a destination and commercial crisis following a natural disaster.",

Crises assume a variety of forms and display differences regarding cause, length, scope and gravity with a range of complexity and severity. Every crisis is unique and their characteristics, evolution and resolution are shaped by a multiplicity of forces both internal and external to the organization and industry. Despite considerable variety and diversity, some common types and features are discernible and lessons learned from particular experiences of crises may have a general applicability.",

There are signs of a greater awareness of this vulnerability and an appreciation of the risks of crises, especially those related to terrorism and natural disasters as a result of the increasing frequency of such events. A number of agencies, including government bodies, are involved in dealing with the consequences of more serious crises and the process of resolution is a dynamic one which can be prolonged. Tourism crises attract intense media interest and modern communications technology assists in the collection and distribution of information about occurrences and their aftermath, including images recorded by victims.",

It also looks ahead to fi nal resolution and a return to normality or near-normality. A more positive approach incorporates the notion of crises as a chance for benefi cial change and growth, as well as a time for solving urgent problems, and Asian commentators frequently observe that the two Chinese characters for the word symbolize fi rstly crisis or danger and then opportunity.",

Although reactive and written after the 2004 tsunami to facilitate rehabilitation in Indonesia, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand, it affords insights into the problems of destination recovery. Strategies which can be employed are classed under the fi ve \"action areas\" of \"marketing communications, community relief, professional training, sustainable redevelopment and risk management\" (WTO, 2005, p. 2). The plan serves as a reminder that crisis management can and should be informed by the philosophies and practices of sustainable tourism (BEST, 2005) and corporate social responsibility.

Extreme economic volatility, violent social upheaval, disease, political dislocation, terrorist atrocities, tropical storms and environmental pollution are present or constantly threatened in several parts of the world and can precipitate tourism crises. The industry will continue to be highly competitive and subject to commercial pressures capable of triggering crises, although it has some control over those crises which are a result of adverse developments of its own creation. There may also be new forms of crises as the industry expands its geographical reach, technology of all manifestations advances and tourist volumes rise.",

Case histories yield valuable lessons and can be a foundation for theories explaining the evolution of tourism crises which permit insightful comparisons across companies, destinations and industries. Analyses can also generate strategic and practical tools for use by managers at the heart of a tourism crisis, especially those from smaller businesses who may be disadvantaged in terms of resources. These represent directions for research journeys, many of which appear to be already embarked upon with more publications on the topic anticipated in the near future.",

Responses have been examined and they have been both reactive and proactive with a trend toward the latter as the tourism industry acknowledges its vulnerability, especially regarding natural disasters and terrorist attacks, and is moving to prepare. Crisis management encompasses a multiplicity of activities and is a cooperative effort for destinations where authorities are expressing greater interest in the subject, a refl ection of the perceived economic rewards of tourism. While more tourism crises are inevitable, it is possible to learn from past experiences so that some situations can be avoided or at least ameliorated through appropriate attitudes and actions by the parties involved.",

There were no casualties among staff or clientele and the company was covered by insurance for any physical destruction. Nevertheless, the crisis for the region was also a corporate crisis. Attention was initially given to cleaning up and undertaking any repairs. The public, media, travel trade and guests were informed and reassured about the situation and arrangements were made regarding any cancellations or postponements of bookings. Those customers with bookings who were reluctant to visit stricken areas were offered various options and 90% agreed to a postponement of their stay to a date within seven months. Alternatively, they could transfer their booking to any of the resorts owned and managed by Banyan Tree. Requests for cancellations were considered individually from those who had booked at the resorts directly affected in Thailand, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. Guests with bookings elsewhere were allowed to delay their visit by three months or choose a transfer. Less than 5% shortened their stay and those who did so could use up remaining nights at another resort, if they had paid in advance, or were not charged for the remaining nights in cases where payment was outstanding.",
