            "text": "Severe neurological complications from seasonal influenza, including influenza-associated encephalopathy/encephalitis (IAE), cause considerable morbidity and mortality in healthy children, and those with pre-existing neurological disease. 1e3 Recent estimates indicate the annual incidence of IAE in Australia is 2.8 per 1,000,000 in children under 14 years, with around 1% of hospitalized influenza cases associated with IAE. 4 Other populations show similar or higher incidence, with Japan's annual incidence of IAE recorded as 6e11/ 1,000,000. 2, 5 Neurological complications attributed to influenza range from a mildly altered mental state, vertigo and brief febrile seizures to life threatening complications such as status epilepticus, meningitis, stroke, and demyelinating disease. 1 Antiviral agents, predominantly neuraminidase inhibitors, and immunomodulatory treatments (corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin), are used to treat patients with influenza-associated neurological disease but there is limited evidence on their efficacy. 6 While it is thought that more extensive changes on MRI correlate with disease severity 7 there are no other available biomarkers that predict outcome. The Australian influenza season typically occurs between July and October. The 2017 season saw the highest levels of influenza reported since the 2009 pandemic year. 8 The authors of this report noted an apparent increase in IAE and other severe neurological complications during 2017. Here, we describe the clinical presentation, laboratory testing, neuroimaging, treatment and short-term outcome of these cases. In addition, we observed elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neopterin e a marker of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation e amongst children with IAE that has not previously described. We compared the frequency of IAE during the 2017 influenza season with previously published incidence estimates.",

One group of children fulfilled criteria for IAE, while the other group, most often with pre-existing neurological disease, presented with status epilepticus but otherwise did not fulfill criteria for IAE. Amongst cases of IAE, elevated CSF neopterin appeared to correlate with the presence of diffusion restriction on MRI brain and adverse outcome. Use of oseltamivir was infrequent among all cases, although use of antibiotics occurred in the majority. Only one child had documented influenza vaccine, even amongst those with pre-existing neurological co-morbidity, despite the fact that this is recommended in Australia. 13 Influenza associated neurological complications are thought to occur due to an inflammatory or immunemediated response to influenza infection rather than direct viral invasion. 14,15 Among those with IAE we observed, similar to previous authors 2,6,16 that CSF pleocytosis and detection of influenza in the CSF occurred in a minority (n \u00bc 5; 35%, and n \u00bc 1/4; 25%). 3, 7, 17, 18 However CSF neopterin, a biomarker of inflammation, was elevated in most children with IAE (n \u00bc 9, 81%). Neopterin, a catabolic product of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), is synthesized by human macrophages upon stimulation from interferon gamma and can be measured in urine, serum and CSF. 19 While serum neopterin levels are useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of systemic infectious or inflammatory diseases, such as HIV, 20 CSF neopterin, reflecting intrathecal production by microglial cells, more accurately detects CNS inflammatory diseases (infectious or immune mediated). 11, 19 A recent review assessing biomarkers of CSF inflammation found, among clinically available tests, that CSF neopterin performed better than the presence of oligoclonal bands or CSF pleocytosis in detection of CNS inflammation. 21 There is limited data regarding prognostically significant biomarkers in IAE. Pro-inflammatory cytokines may impair the blood brain barrier and induce apoptosis of neurons. 14 Elevated cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha have been demonstrated in children with IAE and correlates with poorer outcome. 14, 22, 23 Testing CSF IL-6 outside the research setting is currently unavailable. Clasmatodendrosis, abnormal morphological changes in astrocytes, occurring presumably due to the effect of proinflammatory cytokines, has recently been suggested to be a pathological feature of IAE on autopsy. 24 Clasmatodendrosis was found in the cerebral white matter, thalamus, corpus callosum, cerebellum, thalamus and hippocampus of children with IAE and may correlate MRI changes commonly seen. 24 Previous authors have associated abnormalities on MRI brain with poorer outcome. 7 In our cohort MRI brain abnormalities were diverse and common, particularly diffusion restriction in the subcortical white matter. Diffusion restriction correlated with a poor outcome, apart from in the child who had PRES, and was associated with an elevated CSF neopterin in most cases. Further studies of IAE are required to evaluate whether significant elevations of CSF neopterin, particularly in combination with diffusion restriction and other MRI changes, could predict short and long-term outcome.",

The IAE case frequency observed in our cohort was twice the expected point estimate based on these previous incidence estimates but within the 95% confidence interval, 2 and so contribute to validating the estimates from Britton et al. 2 The short-term outcome of our cohort, particularly those with IAE, was alarming with 64% having a poor outcome. While there was a significant rate of ICU admission among the group of children with status epilepticus (45%) this was not as high as children with IAE (82%) and, most often, non-IAE children did not experience a significant change in their mRS. This supports previous observations that survivors of IAE during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and in more recent nonpandemic influenza seasons in Australia, experienced significant ongoing disability. 29, 30 We have previously shown in a large retrospective encephalitis cohort study that ICU admission, MRI diffusion restriction and status epilepticus and were risk factors for a long-term abnormal outcome. 31 These risk factors were common (82%, 73%, 45%) in children with IAE from our cohort.

            "text": "The overall influenza immunisation rate during 2017 in Australia was low at 33%, 32 however a recently observed rate of vaccine receipt among children was even lower at 17.1%. 33 Four age-specific quadrivalent influenza vaccines containing two strains of Influenza A (H1N1 [Michigan] and H3N2 [Hong Kong]) and two strains of influenza B (Brisbane and Phuket) were available in 2017. Children older than six months were eligible to be vaccinated and the vaccine was provided free to children with neurological disease. 34 In our cohort just one child had a documented influenza vaccination, although a third of children were eligible for free immunisation and the remainder could have received an immunisation at the cost of around $20e50 AUD. We emphasise that the severe syndromes and adverse outcomes observed here should be considered preventable. Following high rates of influenza related morbidity in 2017(including these cases), New South Wales and other Australian states have introduced universal funded seasonal influenza immunisation to all children aged 6 months to 5 years. 35 Our series has limitations. We describe children with severe influenza-associated neurological complications but did not include children with mild neurological complications. Children with pre-existing epilepsy may not have always been tested for influenza and may be under-represented. The collection of clinical data was retrospective, and some electronic data were incomplete. Seasonal influenza immunisation status was not always clearly recorded, although we reviewed the Australian immunisation register to verify vaccination status where possible. Influenza sub-typing from NPA samples and CSF influenza PCR testing was not routinely performed. In the SE group, CSF studies, including CSF neopterin were performed infrequently and MRI brain infrequently requested. Due to this we were unable to use this group as a direct control for the finding of elevated CSF neopterin the IAE group. Serial CSF neopterin to assess treatment and clinical progress were not performed.",

MRI diffusion restriction was associated with a poor outcome in IAE. Short-term outcomes of children with neurological complications of influenza, especially within the IAE group, were alarming, with nearly two-thirds of children having a poor outcome despite receipt of ICU support, anticonvulsants, first-line immunotherapy and, in some, anti-viral treatment. Given the severity of influenza associated neurological complications, we recommend a \"treat and test\" approach to the use of oseltamivir in children presenting with acute encephalopathy/encephalitis during the influenza season. Finally, seasonal influenza vaccination should be universally provided to children and those at risk of severe influenza, with better education and awareness to increase uptake in the paediatric population.",
