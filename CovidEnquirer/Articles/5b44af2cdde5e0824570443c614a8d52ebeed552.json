The DI cDNA contains the hepatitis delta ribozyme sequences to generate in the transfected cells a defined 3 end. In EM studies of transfected cells virus-like particles (VLP) were observed in vesicles. Release of the particles into the medium was studied by immunoprecipitations of proteins released into the culture supernatant. Particle release was independent of S or N, but required M and E. Coexpression of E and M was sufficient for particle release. Coexpression of the structural proteins and the MIDI-HD RNA resulted in the production and release of infectious DI-particles. Infectivity of the DI-particles was determined by adding helper virus MHV-A59 to the medium containing the VLPs and using this mixture to infect new L cells. Intracellular RNA of several subsequent undiluted passages was isolated to detect the MIDI-HD RNA. Passage of the MIDI-HD RNA was dependent on the expression of the structural proteins of MHV-A59 in the transfected cells. In the absence of either E or M, MIDI-HD RNA could not be passaged to fresh L cells. We have thus developed a system in which we can produce coronavirus-like particles and an assay to test their infectivity. \u1b67",

When the VLPs are infectious, they will be able to deliver the packaged cis-acting hepatitis delta ribozyme followed by the T7 terminator sequence into the cDNA clone behind the MIDI-HD RNA to the cytoplasm of the cells and the DI RNA will subsequently be replicated and packaged by poly(A)-tail in order to generate an RNA that has a 3 end that resembles the 3 end of MIDI RNA as much as the coinfecting helper virus MHV-A59. The presence of MIDI-HD in the intracellular RNA is thus used as a marker possible. Only four nonviral nucleotides are present downstream of the poly(A)-tail.
