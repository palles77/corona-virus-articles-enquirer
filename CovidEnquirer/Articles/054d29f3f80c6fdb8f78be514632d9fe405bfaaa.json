The calculated mol. wt. of 159,574 is in good agreement with the size of the protein found in tunicamycin-treated cells or after in vitro translation of mRNA3 (Hu et al., 1984; Jacobs et al., 1986) . The M, of the peplomer protein is approximately 200000, suggesting that most of the 30 potential glycosylation sites (Fig. 2) carry carbohydrate side chains, each of which adds about 2000 to the mol. wt. of the protein (Neuberger et al., 1972) . Recently Rasschaert et al., 1987 have also obtained the TGEV E2 sequence and only 7 amino acid differences have been found (Fig. 2) .",

Presumably these sequences are recognition signals used in the discontinuous transcription mechanism of coronaviruses (Spaan et al., 1983; Brown and Boursnell, 1984) .

Amino acid differences with the TGEV E2 sequence of Rasschaert and Laude (1987) are boxed. The repeating sequences in the intergenic boundaries are indicated by asterisks. Potential glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr except when X = Pro) are underlined. Hydrophobic region (position 1389-1411) and the signal peptide (position 1-14) are indicated by a broken line. (B) Positions of amino acid substitutions (vertical bars) in the FIPV peplomer gene compared to the peplomer gene of TGEV. The arrow indicates residue 274.",
