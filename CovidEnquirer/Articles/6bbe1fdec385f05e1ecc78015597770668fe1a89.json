Although this lesion is uncommon in ferrets, mucocele diagnosis and treatment have been described. 5, 57 Diagnosis of a mucocele is relatively straightforward. Facial swellings are often seen in the commissures of the mouth or in the orbital area in the case of a zygomatic mucocele. Other locations also are possible. Aspirate the mass to obtain samples for cytologic analysis. The fluid is viscous or mucinous and clear or blood-tinged. Cytologic examination reveals amorphous debris and occasional red blood cells.",

Severe gastritis may be evident in gastric biopsy samples from ferrets showing no signs of clinical disease. 22 The histopathologic lesions of H. mustelae-associated gastritis in ferrets, like H. pylori gastritis in humans, consist of mucus depletion, loss of glands, epithelial hyperplasia, foci of dysplasia, and leukocyte infiltration. The organism can be observed in silver-stained histologic sections of gastric mucosa. 26 Severely affected ferrets that die usually have a single large pyloric ulcer or many small ones, and the stomach and intestinal tract contain digested blood and mucus, causing the ingesta to appear very dark.

            "text": "In humans, chronic infection with H. pylori leads to varying clinical and pathologic outcomes, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric adenocarcinoma or mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. 61 The severity and distribution of the H. pylori-induced inflammation are key determinants of these outcomes. 60 Gastritis involving the antrum is associated with excessive acid secretion and a high risk of duodenal ulcer. Gastritis involving the acid-secreting corpus region of the stomach is associated with hypochlorhydria, gastric atrophy, gastric ulcers, and increased risk of gastric cancer. 32 As in humans infected with H. pylori, transient hypochlorhydria develops in ferrets approximately 4 weeks after experimental infection. 53 This condition probably facilitates fecal-oral transmission as well as recovery of H. mustelae from feces. 55 Infection is associated with urease produced in abundance by H. mustelae, which is detectable in gastric biopsy samples and can be used for presumptive diagnosis. Urease production correlates with the degree of colonization and the occurrence of gastritis in biopsy results. 22 A urease breath test is available for humans to aid in diagnosis, and a similar test has been used in ferrets under research conditions but is not practical for clinical use. 55 Gastric atrophy and hypochlorhydria are associated with the ability of H. mustelae to persistently colonize the stomach; hypochlorhydria due to loss of parietal cells allows non-ureaseproducing bacteria to colonize the stomach as well. 22 Helicobacter species inhibit secretion of acid by parietal cells in vitro, and this mechanism may also contribute to hypochlorhydria. 26 In humans, chronic infection with H. pylori is associated with release of cytokines that impair function of enterochromaffin cells, which are neuroendocrine cells in the gastric mucosa that control acid secretion by releasing histamine. The impaired secretory function of these cells may predispose to hypochlorhydria and gastric carcinogenesis. Loss of parietal cells due to chronic inflammation is, however, the primary cause of achlorhydria in humans and ferrets colonized with their respective Helicobacter species. 67 Gastrin is a hormone that stimulates gastric acid secretion and is secreted by the G-cells of the gastric antrum. In humans and probably in ferrets, high levels of gastrin may initiate GI mucosal damage and ulceration. Hypergastrinemia is probably a response to the presence of H. mustelae in the antrum or to its associated inflammation. Hypergastrinemia is abolished after antibiotic therapy eradicates the Helicobacter infection. 22 In humans, Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis is a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma and gastric lymphoma, and H. pylori has been classified as a Class I carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO). 22 There is some evidence that this is also the case in ferrets. As H. pylori does in humans, 41 infection with H. mustelae in ferrets stimulates cell proliferation in the gastric mucosa. 27 Under research conditions, gastric adenocarcinoma developed in aged ferrets that were naturally infected with H. mustelae and treated with a known gastric carcinogen. 22 Spontaneously occurring gastric adenocarcinoma has been reported in pet ferrets. Although in some cases H. mustelae was neither cultured from the lesions nor identified histologically, 69, 76, 78 in other cases, silver-stained organisms that were morphologically compatible with H. mustelae were present in the neoplastic tissues. 27 Lymphoid follicles are observed in the gastric mucosa of humans colonized with H. pylori 91 and in that of ferrets colonized with H. mustelae 26 but not in uninfected individuals. In humans this condition may progress to MALT lymphoma. Eradicating H. pylori usually causes early tumors to regress, implicating the infection as the cause of neoplasia. 90, 91 Gastric MALT lymphoma associated with H. mustelae infection has also been reported in adult ferrets 17 (Fig. 3-7) . None of the affected ferrets were treated with antibiotics to eradicate H. mustelae either before or during the illness associated with neoplasia.",

Differing combinations of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors are used, with varying success. In humans with resistant Helicobacter infections, \"quadruple therapy\" with an added bismuth compound is often used. Bismuth interferes with the colonization of H. pylori in humans and suppresses colonization of H. mustelae in ferrets. 77 Bismuth also has direct antimicrobial actions against Helicobacter. 64 In ferrets, the initial treatment for Helicobacter species in ferrets is commonly a triple-therapy combination of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and bismuth subsalicylate, administered q12h for at least 2 weeks (Table 3-1) . Oral veterinary or pediatric amoxicillin suspensions are palatable and well accepted by most ferrets; metronidazole can be compounded into a suspension for oral administration. Although H. mustelae is sensitive to either amoxicillin or metronidazole, treatment with one of these antibiotics alone or single treatment with other antibiotics is ineffective for eradication therapy. Other drug combinations have been used in ferrets to eradicate H. mustelae, with advantages of improved palatability and convenience of dosing. Clarithromycin (Biaxin, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) (12.5 mg/kg PO q8h) in combination with ranitidine bismuth (24 mg/kg q8h) has been shown to eradicate H. mustelae in ferrets. 53 Ranitidine bismuth citrate tablets (not available in the United States) may be crushed and mixed with a palatable liquid or compounded, and clarithromycin is available as a pediatric suspension. Both drugs are administered for 14 to 21 days (dosages are given in Table 3 -1). A combination of clarithromycin, metronidazole, and omeprazole or clarithromycin and omeprazole proved more effective than triple therapy with amoxicillin, metronidazole, and omeprazole in eradicating H. mustelae in research ferrets. 2 Resistance to clarithromycin has not yet been reported in ferrets but does occur in humans. 53 To prevent development of macrolide-resistant strains, clarithromycin should be combined with a second antibiotic not in the macrolide class. 2 Chloramphenicol has no effect on H. mustelae. 61 Colloidal bismuth subcitrate (8 mg/kg PO q8h) may be substituted for bismuth subsalicylate.",

Weakness can be profound in acutely obstructed animals; some of these ferrets are recumbent and reluctant to ambulate. Trichobezoars can manifest as chronic, intermittent gastric problems: bruxism, weight loss, inappetence, and melena may be reported. Some of these cases can become acute outflow obstructions, whereas in other cases, a more subtle, chronic history can be seen, depending on where the hairball is located in the stomach. If a GI foreign body is suspected, palpate the abdomen carefully. Foreign bodies in the small intestine often are associated with localized discomfort or pain and can usually be palpated, especially under sedation. Gastric foreign bodies are more difficult to palpate because the stomach is under the ribcage. Hold the sedated ferret vertically from the axillae to allow the spleen with the attached stomach to drop down for easier palpation.

Base the diagnosis of liver disease on the presence of persistently high liver enzyme concentrations, radiographic and ultrasound findings, and, for definitive diagnosis, analysis of liver biopsy samples. Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the liver is possible, but a full abdominal exploratory is often recommended because of the likelihood of concomitant disease in ferrets.",

In light of this, the differential diagnoses for emesis in ferrets include both esophageal diseases and gastroenteric disorders. In the clinical history, vomiting is not as frequently described in ferrets as it is in dogs or cats. For example, ferrets rarely vomit hairballs, and often vomiting is not part of the history associated with foreign body ingestion. The reason for this is unclear. No anatomic feature prevents emesis in ferrets; in fact, ferrets have long been laboratory animal models for human emesis studies because vomiting can be induced readily in ferrets in a laboratory setting. 19 The major differential diagnoses for vomiting or regurgitation in ferrets include the presence of a GI foreign body, H. mustelae gastritis, gastroenteritis, and, rarely, megaesophagus. It is uncommon for ferrets with metabolic problems such as azotemia or hepatic disease to vomit. Although definitive diagnosis is not always possible, recognizing whether medical or surgical treatment is required is important. For example, most obstructions caused by a foreign body require surgery, whereas gastroenteritis is a medical disease.

Ferrets with eosinophilic gastroenteritis usually have dramatic eosinophilia (10% to 35% eosinophils compared with 3% to 5% in normal ferrets). Ferrets with lymphosarcoma may not be leukemic, and further tests, such as peripheral lymph node biopsy or a splenic aspirate, are necessary for diagnosis. Inflammation associated with PBD often causes leukocytosis with neutrophilia and a left shift. Ferrets with bleeding ulcers are usually anemic (normal hematocrit is 40% to 55% in spayed or neutered pets, lower in jills in estrus). Dehydration may mask mild anemia and hypoproteinemia in emaciated animals; therefore repeat the CBC after rehydration. Aleutian disease may cause diarrhea, anemia, leukocytosis, and wasting. Serologic tests for Aleutian disease virus are available (see Chapter 5), but many ferrets with positive test results are asymptomatic for Aleutian disease. Clinicians should not assume that illness in ferrets that are seropositive for Aleutian disease virus is caused by the virus.",

            "text": "Most cachectic ferrets with diarrhea that do not have a GI foreign body or eosinophilia presumably have both ileitis/ colitis and H. mustelae-associated gastritis with ulcers. While waiting for results of diagnostic tests, if the ferret is treated for only one disease, the time required for recognizing treatment failure may be the factor that ultimately decides if the ferret will survive. Unfortunately, the effective drugs used for treating the diseases associated with wasting are different, and therapy necessitates multiple daily doses of several drugs for at least 2 weeks. Because the gut flora of ferrets is very simple and plays no vital role in digestion, long-term administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics does not cause dysbiosis and diarrhea in ferrets as it does in many species. Emaciated ferrets that die despite proper treatment usually have either very extensive gastric ulcers or severe ileitis, each of which drastically reduces the absorption of essential nutrients. The age of the animal may sometimes help in the differential diagnosis; young ferrets are more likely to develop PBD, whereas older ferrets develop inflammatory bowel disease or severe, chronic gastritis associated with H. mustelae infection. 29 Also, H. mustelae-associated disease is more often associated with stress factors common in mature pet ferrets, such as concurrent disease or surgery (see Table 3 -2).",

Some animals refuse to eat their regular diet of dry pellets but do accept the same food mixed with water and heated in a microwave until it develops a porridge-like consistency. Supplemental foods formulated specifically for carnivores such as Carnivore Care (Oxbow Animal Health) or Emeraid Carnivore (Lafebervet.com) are readily accepted by most ferrets when fed by syringe. Alternatively, offer nutritional recovery foods formulated for dogs and cats such as Maximum-Calorie (The Iams Company, Dayton, OH) or Canine a/d (Hill's Pet Nutrition); most sick ferrets accept these foods readily. Nutritional recovery diets such as these can be used as the sole source of nutrition for several weeks if necessary. When using these diets, calculate a minimum daily intake of 400 kcal per kilogram of body weight. Sick ferrets may not make the effort to get up and drink from a water bottle but do usually drink from a dish. Offer fresh food and water by hand several times daily during hospitalization and home care; ferrets often take a few mouthfuls of every new offering but never go back for more. The first 2 days are critical for an animal that has lost 40% to 50% of its body weight, and intensive supportive care is essential.",
