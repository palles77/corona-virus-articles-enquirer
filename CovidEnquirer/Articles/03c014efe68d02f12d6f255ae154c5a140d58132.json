In recent years, broad-spectrum multiplex PCR panels have been developed which are propagated as syndromic tests to diagnose respiratory infections (Popowitch et al., 2013) . Whether highly multiplexed assays should be used as first-line tests is controversially discussed (Schreckenberger and McAdam, 2015) . Whereas added clinical value of highly multiplexed assays is generally accepted, it remains unclear how exactly they are to be implemented in clinical routine (Dundas et al., 2011) . A definite diagnosis can help in improved patient management, that is by avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic treatment (Schreckenberger and McAdam, 2015; Templeton, 2007) . Underdiagnosing of specific infections has been put forward as another argument for use of highly multiplexed assays. Moreover, even for infectious diseases typically presenting with a combination of somehow specific symptoms, diagnosis in patients with comorbidities can be difficult (Campe et al., 2015) .",

During a 6-month period from January 1 2015, to June 26 2015, all upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as sputum samples for which the clinicians requested a viral diagnostic test, were analyzed using the FTD-RP21 multiplex panel from Fast-track diagnostics (Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg, Germany), run on the LightCycler 480 II. Nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This multiplex real-time PCR (Anderson et al., 2013; Bierbaum et al., 2014; Sakthivel et al., 2012) consists of 5 reaction mixtures (hydrolysis probes) which cover influenza A and B; influenza A (H1N1); coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1; parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus A and B; rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial viruses A and B; adenovirus; enterovirus; parechovirus; and bocavirus. Moreover, it also includes one bacterial target, M. pneumoniae. Detection of M. pneumoniae normally is not done at the virology department but has to be requested separately at the bacteriology department. Thus, we could analyze in an unbiased setup what the clinical value of a multiplex approach for detection of M. pneumoniae would be, as the request for diagnostic at the virology, the bacteriology or both departments was solely dependent on the clinicians' decision. Clinicians were not aware of the use of the panel PCR covering M. pneumoniae in samples with virologal request.",

            "text": "In total, N = 2211 respiratory samples were analyzed by the FTD-RP21 assay (Fig. 1A ). Of those, N = 23 samples (1.04%), derived from 20 individual patients, were tested positive for M. pneumoniae. This is in the range of surveillance data from Germany (Weigl et al., 2007) . Of the positive samples, 21 were confirmed in the bacteriology department by an in house PCR assay, the other 2 samples had high Ct values (Ct N35, indicative of low input) and were not available for retesting. Thus, the FTD-RP21 assay reliably detects M. pneumoniae. The 3 most prevalent results in the analyzed cohort were influenza A (positive detection rate 13.0%), RSV (6.9%), and coronavirus OC43 (2.8%) with an overall Next, we asked whether for positively tested patients the bacteriology department had received a specific request for detection of M. pneumoniae by PCR as well. Only for 2 patients (10%) clinicians had specifically asked for a M. pneumoniae-specific PCR, leaving N = 18 patients that were only diagnosed \"unintentionally\" because of the use of the multiplex panel. Of the 20 patients positive for M. pneumoniae, only 3 showed also other viruses (H1N1, RSV, OC43, each once). Frequent codetection of viruses has been reported in children (Weigl et al., 2007) ; however, in adults suffering from community acquired pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae was often the only pathogen (Holter et al., 2015) . Given the overall positivity rate of 34.5% for any virus by the FTD-RP21 assay, the isolated detection of M. pneumoniae argues for the clinical relevance of the result to explain the patients' symptoms. DNA positivity in M. pneumoniae infection has been reported to have a short median of 9.5 days (Gotoh et al., 2013) . Thus, in a situation with clinical symptoms and no codetection of virus, the positive result for M. pneumoniae argues for an acute infection.",

Thus, multiplex assays bear the potential to affect patient outcome, yet costeffectiveness in general and clinically meaningful composition of such panels are still to be discussed (Schreckenberger and McAdam, 2015) . Alternatively, targeted, directed diagnostics will depend on amendments in the preanalytics, including detailed knowledge on the regional and temporal epidemiology of the various infectious organisms, as exemplified in this study.",
