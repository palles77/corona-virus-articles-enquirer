Still, conceptual legal frameworks for the systematic application of law to chronic disease prevention and control have not been fully recognized and used to address public health needs. Development and implementation of legal frameworks could broaden the range of effective public health strategies and provide valuable tools for the public health workforce, especially for state and local health department program managers and state and national policy makers. In an effort to expand the range of effective public health interventions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will work with its partners to explore the development of systematic legal frameworks as a tool for preventing chronic diseases and addressing the growing epidemic of obesity, heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases and their risk factors.",

One prominent example is a renewed interest in quarantine, including the adequacy of relevant legal authorities and due process protections. In addition to the highly visible legal aspects of such recent problems involving acute diseases, seminal work is underway to provide options for strengthening laws essential to public health infrastructure and public health practice (3) . Other commentators have examined the roles of specific legal processes, such as litigation, and of legal frameworks as tools for addressing public health problems (4, 5) .",

Some laws directly require a behavioral change on the part of individuals in the target population -such as seat belt laws -whereas others directly change the environment -such as community water fluoridation or food fortification laws -and require no new action on the part of the target population to be effective. Other laws are more complex in their mechanism of inducing a change. For example, some laws, such as smoking bans, require a behavioral change that ultimately results in an environmental change with beneficial effects on the target population. Other laws require an organizational policy change that ultimately leads to a behavioral change, such as required insurance-industry coverage of smoking cessation services, a requirement that leads to an increased demand for and delivery of the services, which eventually yields greater cessation rates. These examples and still other laws have been used to address chronic diseases and injuries ( Table 2 ). As discussed in the following sections, 3 of these laws -smoking bans, blood alcohol concentration (BAC) laws, and food fortification regulations -demonstrate the impact and effectiveness of legislation on specific public health problems.

Smoking bans were more effective in reducing ETS exposures than were smoking restrictions, and bans were effective in a wide variety of public and private workplaces and health care settings.

In particular, fatal alcohol-related crashes provide a sensitive measure of the effectiveness of 0.08% BAC laws. A systematic literature review conducted as part of the Guide to Community Preventive Services identified 9 studies that evaluated the effectiveness of 0.08% BAC per se laws (29) . Each study evaluated 0.08% BAC laws in one or more of the 16 states that implemented the laws before January 1, 1998. After implementation of the laws, the median decrease in fatal alcohol-related motorvehicle crashes was 7%. On the basis of these studies, the estimated number of lives that could be saved annually if all states were to enact 0.08% BAC laws ranges from 400 to 600. ",

At the outset of World War II, the high percentage of recruits who were ineligible for military service because of nutritional deficiency diseases prompted the Council on National Defense to request that the National Academy of Sciences establish a Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) (30) . At the time, niacin deficiency accounted for approximately 100,000 cases of pellagra annually, and pellagra was the eighth or ninth leading cause of death in many southern states (31) . The cause of pellagra was unknown before 1937 (32) . One of the first activities of the FNB was to establish recommended intake levels of approximately a dozen nutrients, including niacin. Enrichment of bread was effected by the Food Distribution Order No. 1 issued on December 29, 1942, which became effective January 18, 1943 . Several states instituted mandatory enrichment laws for bread and flour at the same time (31) . Enrichment laws were followed in a short time by a decrease in pellagra-related morbidity and mortality. More recently, in 1998, the Food and Drug Administration mandated the addition of 140 mcg of folic acid per 100 gm of cereal-grain products (33) to reduce the prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs) (20) . This strategy appears to have produced a 19% reduction in the frequency of NTDs (20) .",
