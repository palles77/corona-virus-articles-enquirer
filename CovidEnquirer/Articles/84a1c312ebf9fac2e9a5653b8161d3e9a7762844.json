In a short period of time, new SARS cases spread around the world, information on the epidemic flooded the news, and healthcare organizations were faced with a new challenge. The disease was contagious, relatively fatal and thought to be contracted by droplet contamination. Healthcare workers (HCWs) were also infected and died from the disease. In Israel, there were a number of suspected SARS cases, but none were confirmed after testing. Due to the uncertainty and fear associated with the new phenomenon and the lack of guidelines or a clear policy, the initial steps taken to cope with SARS required fast clinical and administrative decisions. Decision-making in a time of emergency is associated with a high potential for ethical dilemmas and conflicts.",

There was a large element of hysteria and anxiety in the community's reaction to SARS, and as one Chinese physician reported, 'Many patients were less sick to death than scared to death'. 1 On 16 March 2003, the Unit of Infectious Diseases issued initial instructions on this emerging syndrome to all the units at the Assaf-Harofeh Medical Centre. The Israeli Ministry of Health issued their first memo on 30 March 2003, and designated our hospital as a centre for screening SARS patients. The instructions issued by our unit and the ministerial memo did not deal with any ethical or legal issues related to coping with SARS. We cared for 19 cases of suspected SARS between 19 April and 14 June 2003, and none of these cases were confirmed after testing.",

In China, for example, a new hospital was dedicated solely to the treatment of SARS patients. In Israel, incoming passengers from SARS-infected areas had their temperature measured in the airport, nurses screened travellers for suspicious symptoms, and aeroplanes were cleaned scrupulously.

The limits we placed on the parent were that they must remain in isolation with their child. Did we have the right to allow the parent to place him or herself in danger?

Modern technology can provide solutions to problems faced in pandemics but cannot change the human element. Therefore, it is important that we consider the rights protected and those transgressed before reaching final decisions, and important to avoid further transgression. We wish to illustrate this point with a few examples, which also serve to show the role of common sense. The original solid wood doors to our isolation rooms were replaced by doors with large windows to allow visual contact and curtains to allow privacy. Telephones and televisions were supplied in the rooms, and a primary infection control nurse was available 24 h/day.

Ethics consultations to assist clinicians are becoming more common and have been shown to reduce length of stay and procedures in intensive care units. 6 Furthermore, publications from Canada, which coped with the SARS epidemic in large numbers, reveal that their organization included both ethical and psychological support teams. 4 An article in JAMA examined the ethical and legal challenges posed by SARS. 7 In a bulletin of the World Health Organization, the limitations of international law with regard to communicable diseases were emphasized. 8 Infection control practitioners are directly involved with new infectious diseases and so should also be closely involved in developing the policies and the actions required to contain them. Had there been such involvement, it is uncertain whether our decisions would have been different or whether the decision-making process would have been more complex. We recommend the immediate availability of legal and ethical consultants in the field whose input could be utilised in times of stress by supporting the clinical staff in coping with ethical dilemmas. The Israeli Patient's Rights Act 9 requires the formation of an ethics committee in every hospital. Such a committee might have been useful in coping with the issues raised here.
