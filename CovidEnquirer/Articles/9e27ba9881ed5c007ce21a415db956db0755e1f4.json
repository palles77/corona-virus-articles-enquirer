Three of them (adefovir, cidofovir, tenofovir; Fig. 1 ) have been marketed for treatment of viral infection caused by HIV, HBV, HSV and other DNA viruses [2] [3] [4] [5] . The concept of acyclic nucleosides is based on the assumption that an acyclic moiety most often bearing an oxygen atom mimics the furanose ring at least partially. Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates require conversion in vivo to their triphosphate metabolites to become active [2, 6] . The replacement of the natural phosphate moiety by a phosphonate group makes analogues less susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis [7, 8] .",

The 31 P NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture revealed the presence of the expected phosphonate 10a (76 %), bicyclic 1,2,3-triazolopyridazinedione 11a (11 %) and their monodealkylated counterparts 12a and 13a (10 and 3 %, respectively) (Fig. 6 ).

These values [42] together with small couplings for 3 J(P-H2a) and 3 J(P-H2b) [43, 44] allowed us to unequivocally establish 14g (Fig. 7) as the preferred conformation of phosphonate 9g although other phosphonates from this series very likely adopt the same anti conformation. Large values (16.9-19.2 Hz) of 3 J(P-CC-C3) [44] [45] [46] observed in the 13 C NMR spectra of phosphonates 8-11 containing a three-carbon fragment between the phosphorus atom and the 1,2,3-triazole ring (series b, e, and f) evidenced the preference of antiperiplanar conformations 14b, 14e, and 14f ( Fig. 7) for these compounds. This conclusion was further supported by vicinal H1-H2 couplings calculated for 2-and 1-hydroxyphosphonates (series e and f) which clearly indicated gauche (3.0-3.6 Hz) and anti (9.6-10.8 Hz) arrangements of the respective H-C1C2-H protons.",
