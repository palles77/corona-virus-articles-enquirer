RT-LAMP characterized by one strand displacement reaction with the specific stem-loop structure and Bst DNA polymerase could be finished in 60 min under isothermal condition at 63 \u2022 C. RT-LAMP assay showed higher sensitivity with 10 1 copies/L than RT-PCR for the detection of Sapelovirus. The specificity of RT-LAMP assay was validated by the absence of any cross-reaction with other closely related virus in Picornaviridae group and other common virus causing porcine diarrhea. 7 positive Sapelovirus infection out of 63 fecal samples were identified using RT-LAMP, while 5 positive samples were determined by a conventional RT-PCR. A cost-effective method for Saplovirus detection with high sensitivity and specificity was developed and evaluated.",

This genus comprised three species, including Porcine Sapelovirus (PSV) (Fauquet et al., 2005) , Simian Sapelovirus and Avian Sapelovirus. Porcine Sapelovirus 1 formally named Porcine Enterovirus 8 (PEV-8) and classified as a Porcine Enterovirus A (PEV A), Porcine Sapelovirus strain csh and Porcine Sapelovirus strain YC2011 are the three well acknowledged strains of PSV (Chen et al., 2012; Krumbholz et al., 2002; Lan et al., 2011) . The genome of PSV is a single-stranded positive sense RNA with length of 7.5-8.3 kb nucleotides (Jauka, 2010) . It contains a single open reading frame flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) at both ends, and a long 5 UTR (600-1200 nts) (Tuthill et al., 2010) . Similar to Porcine Enterovirus (PEV) and Porcine Teschovirus (PTV), PSV is the causative pathogen of neurological disorders, reproductive failure, pneumonia and diarrhea in porcine (Trefny, 1930) . PSV is also found frequently to co-infection with other viral pathogen in pigs with diarrhea (Lan et al., 2011) .",

Several molecular methods for detecting PSV have been developed, such as reverse transcription PCR (Palmquist et al., 2002) , nest reverse transcription PCR (Zell et al., 2000) , and real-time quantitative PCR (Krumbholz et al., 2003) . However, these methods require expensive and sophisticated instruments, which restrict their wide use. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel nucleic acid amplification method which employs Bst DNA polymerase and four specially designed primers recognizing a total of six distinct sequences on the target DNA, and amplifies DNA under isothermal conditions within 1 h (Notomi et al., 2000) . In amplification process, a large amount of pyrophosphate ions are produced and react with magnesium ions resulting in formation of magnesium pyrophosphate, a white precipitate that allows easy and rapid assessment of results (Mori et al., 2001) . The present study aimed to develop the RT-LAMP assay for detection of Chinese Porcine Sapelovirus strain. Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) were conserved in the laboratory. Porcine Teschovirus (PTV) and Encephalomyocarditis Virus (EMCV) were received from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) and Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute of CAAS respectively, and Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) vaccine strain was purchased from China Animal Husbandry Industry Company Limited. Fecal samples were collected from healthy adult porcine in Shanghai piggeries for RT-LAMP evaluation. Viral RNA was extracted by using the TIANamp virus DNA/RNA kit (TianGen, Beijing, China) and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C until use.",

Specificity of the RT-LAMP assay was analyzed by cross-reactivity with viruses belonging to Picornaviridae, such as PTV, PEV9, FMDV, EMCV and other symptom related virus, like TGEV, PEDV and PRRSV. RT-LAMP demonstrated high specificity for PSV infection (Fig. 4) .",

Furthermore, the reaction tube can be incubated in a water bath, which is economical (Mori et al., 2001) . The RT-LAMP assay has developed as a powerful gene amplification tool to detect and diagnose infectious diseases, such as the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus (Dukes et al., 2006) , West Nile Virus , Hepatitis E Virus (Lan et al., 2009) , and SARS Coronavirus (Thai et al., 2004) .",

The sensitivity of the RT-LAMP was 10 copies/L, and 100 times higher than RT-PCR. RT-LAMP detecting PSV infection is high specific with no cross-reaction with other viral pathogens. RT-LAMP also showed higher sensitivity by identification of two more positive samples than traditional RT-PCR (7 positive by RT-LAMP and 5 positive by RT-PCR). None of the RT-PCR detecting positive samples was missed by RT-LAMP, further showing the higher sensitivity of the RT-LAMP.",
