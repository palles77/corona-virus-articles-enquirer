Informed by research in rumor psychology and risk/crisis communication, it investigates whether type of rumor and rumor response strategy have main and interaction effects on reducing rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor. The two featured rumor types are the bogie rumor, which highlights feared outcomes, and the wedge rumor, which aims to reinforce differences between rival groups. Derived from Situational Crisis Communication Theory, the three response strategies examined are refuting the rumor, denying it, and attacking its source. Data were drawn from part of a large-scale online experiment, and the sample of the analysis was 942 South Korean adults. The experiment had a between-subjects design of 2 rumor type (wedge vs. bogie) x 3 government response strategies (refutation, denial, attack the attacker). Results show that all three rumor response strategies significantly reduced rumor beliefs, but only the refutation strategy significantly reduced intention to disseminate the rumor. Rumor type (bogie) and response strategies (refutation) had main, but not interaction, effects on reduction of intention to disseminate the rumor.",

Informed by research in rumor psychology and crisis communication (Coombs, 2000; DiFonzo & Bordia, 2000 , 2007 , it explores three questions. First, what effects do different types of risk rumors have on people's beliefs in the rumor and their intention to disseminate the rumor? Second, what kinds of rumor response strategies significantly lower rumor beliefs and intentions to disseminate rumors? Drawn from Situational Crisis Communication Theory, the three response strategies examined are refuting the rumor, denying it, and attacking its source. Third, are there possible interaction effects between types of rumor and types of rumor response strategies? We address these research questions in the context of rumors related to food safety risks, specifically radiationcontaminated foods from the seas near Fukushima, Japan. This risk issue takes center stage in this study because, in South Korea for the past seven years, it has received ongoing attention in the public, media, and government agendas.",

            "text": "On 11 March 2011, a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the northeast Tohoku region of Japan, where Fukushima Prefecture is located. Among the disaster's serious consequences was damage to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Dangerous radioactive material was released into the environment, and thousands of people were evacuated. After the air, land, and seas near Fukushima were found to be contaminated, the neighboring country of South Korea banned imports of agricultural and seafood products originating from the area. For months and years afterward, several rumors about these radiation hazards spread among the South Korean public. Many rumors were about whether Japan was exporting contaminated seafood, and whether the Japanese and South Korean governments were colluding to cover up foisting that food onto unwitting South Korean consumers (Kim & Kim, 2017) . In the months immediately after the nuclear accident, sales of Japanese fishery products in South Korea plummeted (Jeong, 2011) . One year later in 2012, fish caught from the seas near Fukushima were found to contain dangerously high levels of radioactive cesium (Fish with, 2013) . In 2013, the South Korean government widened its ban and issued stricter safety standards on seafood imports from Fukushima and surrounding areas. As recently as April 2018, the legality of these stricter regulations remained under dispute at the World Trade Organization by the Japanese and South Korean governments (Koreans still, 2018; S. Korea files, 2018) .",

A 2017 survey conducted by the South Korean Consumers Union reports the following: 46 percent of South Korean consumers support a complete ban of all food imports from Japan; over 50 percent avoid buying Japanese seafood and dairy products; safety concerns are the reason why many have reduced or curtailed their consumption; and substantial numbers of people are concerned that radiation exposure may cause cancer, birth deformities, and hereditary disease. However, in light of current scientific findings, most of these fears are unfounded or at least exaggerated (Koreans still, 2018).",

            "text": "People's responses to risks are often determined not by the actual hazards they face but by their subjective judgments about risks -that is, their risk perceptions (Slovic, 2000) . Compared to experts, lay people are understandably under-informed and uncertain about many risk issues. Risk communication therefore plays a key role in efforts to give people necessary information, cultivate accurate risk perceptions, reduce public uncertainty, and help people make the right decisions for dealing with risks (Walaski, 2011) . However, during risk outbreaks one thing that often interferes with these efforts is the spread of rumors. A rumor can be defined as \"a proposition for belief of topical reference disseminated without official verification,\" and it tends to have three characteristics: first, it is often transmitted, and thereby distorted, through word-of-mouth; second, it provides information regarding particular persons, events, or conditions; third, it serves certain communities' emotional needs (Knapp, 1944, pp. 22-23) . Rumors have been classified into several types depending on factors such as content characteristics, discursive quality, valence, time period of occurrence, cause of occurrence, motive of occurrence, and breadth of dissemination (Kim, 1997; Peterson & Gist, 1951) .",

The wedge, wedge-driving, or aggression rumor reinforces differences between the intended audience and rival groups.

For certain ongoing public health issues such as vaccination and contraceptive use, rumors may influence people to disregard experts' health and safety recommendations (DiFonzo & Bordia, 2007) . During several major disasters and infectious disease outbreaks, rumors have misled people into panicking and taking unnecessary or counterproductive actions such as stocking up on foods and staying home from work (DiFonzo & Bordia, 2007) . As a result of misleading rumors spread online during the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea, people were persuaded to avoid health clinics where MERS-infected patients were falsely reported to have been admitted (Lee, 2015) . At that time there were also steep sales increases for vitamins and foods that were marketed as, but not proven to be, effective in treating MERS (Choi, 2015) .",

            "text": "After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster, misleading rumors spread in the wake of news reports about contamination of neighboring seawater by radioactive material. As of 2018, a Google search of the Korean terms for \"Japan + radiation + rumor\" yielded about 39,000 results, and \"Fukushima + fishery + rumor\" in Korean yielded about 10,000 results. In the aftermath of the disaster, the South Korea Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries was compelled to respond to multiple rumors related to Japanese food radiation matters (Japan's radioactivity, 2013). The rumors claimed that Japan was exporting radiation-contaminated seafood to South Korea, and that the South Korean government and importers were accepting it, selling it to unwitting Korean citizens, and covering up their conspiracy. In this case, the types of unverified claims that were spread illustrate the tendency for risk-related rumors to be negative, inaccurate, conspiracy-laden, and likely to frighten people. In 2013, two years after the Fukushima disaster, persistent rumors about contaminated food imports were so widespread and inaccurate that the South Korean Prime Minister publicly threatened legal punishments for people caught spreading them (Kim & Kim, 2017) . Most academic studies of risk-related rumors have focused on those that arise during corporate public relations crises. When they jeopardize an organization's reputation, rumors themselves are considered to be a type of crisis (An, Gower, & Cho, 2011; Coombs, 2006; DiFonzo & Bordia, 2000) . Several studies of crisis-related rumors in South Korea have focused on how rumor types or rumor characteristics relate to the following variables: rumor-related beliefs about risks, intention to disseminate risk rumors, risk-related purchasing behaviors, and perceptions of the reputations of organizations deemed responsible for causing risks (e.g., Kim, Yoo, & Kahn, 2015; Lee & Kim, 2016; Zhang & Cho, 2017) . Among the examined factors that affected rumor beliefs and dissemination intention are channel characteristics (e.g., trust in Internet information: Kim & Kim, 2017; Ryu & Kim, 2016) , audience characteristics (involvement, efficacy, emotional reaction: Ahn & Lee, 2011) , and information processing (Kwon & Cho, 2017) .",

For example, one corporate crisis study found that the conspiracy-type rumor -a rumor that a particular company or organization is plotting for its own self-interest or hiding important facts -had a higher level of rumor beliefs than did the contaminating-type rumor -a rumor that contains claims about a product's contamination, deformation, or damage that may affect perceptions of the product's value (Zhang & Cho, 2017) . Of interest in national-level risk contexts are the extent to which people believe in rumors and intend to disseminate them. These variables -rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor -have been important outcome variables in rumor research because they could lead to serious behavioral consequences. For these reasons, and informed by a content analysis showing that bogie and wedge rumors appear most frequently during risk outbreaks (Yang & Paek, 2018) , the current study investigates possible differential effects of rumor type on rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor. Due to a lack of empirical evidence justifying statement of a hypothesis, we propose the following research question.",

By contrast, Coombs (2000) found that different strategies are effective in different circumstances: when the attacker is identified, refutation and attacking the attacker are more effective; when the attacker is not identified or when attributed corporate responsibility is low, either explanation or denial is more effective. In relation to the desired outcomes of product purchase intention, CEO credibility, and corporate credibility, one study found that more aggressive strategies -e.g., refutations and attacks via legal actions, evidentiary materials, or formal press conferences -are more effective than passive denial strategies (Jang & Cho, 2013) .",

The purpose of the current study was to identify which type of rumor people tend to believe more and intend to disseminate more, and which type of government response strategies might effectively reduce these reactions.

This finding indicates that the spread of wedge rumors, which in this type of case are more likely to reinforce feelings of difference between the intended audience and the government, may be more difficult to restrain regardless of government response efforts. Furthermore, results for our manipulation check show that there was no difference between the two rumor types in terms of the manipulation check question, \"The information you just read contains content that creates fear and anxiety.\" This result suggests that, even though bogie rumors specifically highlight outcomes that the intended audience is likely to fear (DiFonzo & Bordia, 2007; Knapp, 1944) , any type of rumor related to a risk conveys uncertainty and unease. Accordingly, risk communicators should pay special attention to wedge rumors because their content -criticisms about government actions and conspiracies -may be more likely to generate emotional reactions such as panic and distrust of the government.",

In the context of corporate crisis situations, Jang and Cho (2013) also found that the most effective strategies are not passive ones such as denial but rather more aggressive ones such as attacks and refutations via legal actions, evidentiary materials, or formal press conferences. In the current study's context of risk issues affecting public health, the government's perceived ability to handle a risk is critical, particularly when rumor sources may not be easily identified. However, if the government attacks rumor sources by threatening punishments, this strategy might have adverse consequences on people's trust in government and their perceptions of its ability to deal with the risk. For these reasons, the best rumor response strategy to use in the case of rumors about a public health issue such as food safety seems to be refutation.",

If people do not trust these institutions, they will not attend to, much less comply with, their recommendations. While the role of trust in government in risk rumor contexts has not yet been explored and was not a primary focus of the current study, our instrument included it, and we performed a post-hoc analysis, i.e., ANCOVA with the variable as a covariate. Results show that trust in government did not affect our findings on the main and interaction effects of rumor type and rumor response strategies. However, the trust variable itself had some marginal effects on reduction in rumor beliefs (F(1,934) = 3.05, p = .08), as well as on intention to disseminate the rumor (F(1,934) = 3.46, p = .08). This finding suggests that trust in government may be an important element in the rumor management process. Future research about risk rumor management should therefore more closely examine its potential mediating and moderating roles. As for interaction effects of rumor type and response strategy on reducing rumor beliefs and intention to disseminate rumor, none were found. In the context of developing effective crisis response messages, Coombs (2000) has recommended deploying different strategies under different circumstances: when the attacker is identified, refutation and attacking the attacker are more effective; when the attacker is not identified or when attributed corporate responsibility is low, explanation or denial are more effective. Our findings, though, do not support such conditional effects. This result may point to key differences between rumors about risk issues that affect public health and rumors about crisis issues that affect organizations' reputations. If more studies identify and confirm such differences, risk communicators will be better informed about appropriate ways to respond to rumors during national-level risks.",

Future research should further investigate both main and interaction effects of rumor type and response strategies on other outcomes such as uncertainty reduction, emotional reactions, or behavioral responses. Also, in addition to rumor type and response strategy type, various other factors in this process should be taken into consideration, such as characteristics of rumor, rumor source, and audience.

Practically, our findings suggest that the government's response to a rumor plays an important role in controlling public beliefs about it. However, to make that control more effective, what matters more is which specific rumor response strategy the government uses.
