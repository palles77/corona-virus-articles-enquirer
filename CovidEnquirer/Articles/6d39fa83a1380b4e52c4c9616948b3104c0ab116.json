CD46 is another co-stimulatory receptor that promotes differentiation of CD4 + T-helper cells type 1 (Th1 cells) into a regulatory phenotype with a switch from IFN-\u03b3 towards IL-10-secretion over time. Whether CD46 exerts a similar function on CD8 + T cells remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that CD46 co-stimulation induced secretion of IFN-\u03b3 as well as expansion of IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8 + T cells. In contrast to CD46 co-stimulation of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells did not differentiate into a regulatory IL-10-secreting phenotype. This demonstrates that CD46 is a co-stimulatory receptor on CD8 + T cells, and that it exerts separate functions during CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell differentiation.",

This subset has previously been identified in a mouse model for acute influenza virus [9] , and in the brain of coronavirus-infected mice [10] . In humans, a regulatory CD8 + T cell subset generated in vitro from CD8 + CD28 \u2212 but not from CD8 + CD28 + T cells was able to inhibit T-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity by secretion of IL-10 [11] . Using tetramer-sorted antigen-specific CD8 + T cells from controls and solid organ transplanted patients, controls had relatively few IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10-producing, double-positive cells, whereas EBV antigen-specific CD8 + T cells from solid organ transplanted patients produced equal levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 [12] . Although CD46 was reported to slightly increase proliferation of CD8 + T-cells as well as expression of surface markers involved in T-cell activation, it did not induce a significant increase in IFN-\u03b3 production [13] .

Activation of CD46 on CD4 + T cells has previously been demonstrated to cause a rapid down-modulation of CD46 from the cell surface [8, 17] . We therefore examined whether stimulation of isolated CD8 + T cells in vitro with \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD46 resulted in a similar downmodulation of CD46 from the cell surface. This demonstrated that 2 h of activation caused a rapid down-modulation of CD46 from the surface of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1B) .",

Upon activation both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells secreted IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10, which accumulated in the supernatant as measured by ELISA. As expected, we were able to confirm a significant increase in the level of IL-10 in supernatants from CD46-co-stimulated CD4 + T cells ( Fig. 2A) . Although CD46 co-stimulation also induced the secretion of IL-10 in CD8 + T cells, the average level in the supernatant was less than 3% of that seen for CD4 + T cells (Fig. 2B) . This is in accordance with an observation by Kemper et al. that CD46 was unable to induce IL-10 production in several distinct immune cell subsets, including CD8 + T cells [7] . In contrast, CD46 co-stimulation induced higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 in CD8 + T cells when compared with CD4 + T cells. These data suggest that costimulation of CD46 together with CD3 increases the amount of secreted IFN-\u03b3 from both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell cultures, whereas it induces IL-10 secretion mainly from CD4 + T cells. The CD46-induced IFN-\u03b3 production in CD8 + T cells was dependent on IL-2, since no or little IFN-\u03b3 levels could be detected in the absence of exogenous IL-2 (Fig. 2C ). This suggests a cross talk between CD46 and IL-2R signaling, as has also been suggested for CD4 + T cells [4] .",

Nevertheless, it has been reported that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are unable to switch into IL-10 production following CD46 stimulation presumably due to expression of an alternative isoform of CD46 [4] . CD46 is alternatively spliced and expressed in predominantly four isoforms. Notably, these isoforms express one of two possible intracytoplasmic tails, known as CYT-1 and CYT-2, which are thought to transmit different signals within the CD4 + T cell. CYT-1 isoforms may promote CD4 + T-cell activation, whereas CYT-2 isoforms may be involved in the contraction of the response [4, 6, 8] . We have previously characterized CD46 isoform expression on subsets of immune cells including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and demonstrated interindividual differences, but intraindividual similarities [18] . Thus, based on their total CD46 expression (Fig. 1A) and isoform expression pattern, it is not predicted that CD46 co-stimulation should differ between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Thus, the lack of a CD46-promoted IL-10 switch in CD8 + T cells is unlikely to be caused by expression of an alternative CD46 isoform but may be caused by other inherent differences in the induction of the IL-10 promoter between the two subsets of T cells.",

Activation of CD8 + T cells increased the frequency of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells, and the frequency was further elevated upon CD46 co-stimulation. Whereas CD46 co-stimulation of CD4 + T cells in the presence of IL-2 induced a shift to IFN- \u03b3 + IL-10 + double positive cells and IL-10 + single positive cells over 3 days of culture, CD8 + T cells increased the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 + cells but did not show a shift towards production of IL-10 even in the presence of exogenous IL-2. This suggests a different function of CD46 costimulation in CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, respectively, where CD46 costimulation of CD8 + T cells promotes expansion and consequently a strong IFN-\u03b3 response. In contrast, CD46 co-stimulation of CD4 + T cells promotes an IFN-\u03b3 response and a subsequent shift towards a strong IL-10 response that may act as an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism.",

In addition, IFN-\u03b3-deficient mice have impaired contraction of antigen-specific CD8 + T cells [23, 24] . Thus, CD46 may in CD8 + T cells serve to induce an efficient antigenspecific T-cell response and favor generation of memory cells. The quite substantial induction of IFN-\u03b3 in CD8 + T cells by CD46 may also serve as a later negative feedback regulation of the immune response given the significance of this cytokine for the contraction phase of the antigen-specific response.",

However, we speculate that it might also result from differences in intrinsic regulatory mechanisms such as a lack of the switch into an inhibitory IL-10 production following the initial effector cytokine production phase.",

            "text": "In this study, we have demonstrated that CD46 exerts separate functions in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, since it promotes the differentiation of an IL-10-producing regulatory subset in Th1 cells, whereas it predominantly expands the IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8 + T cells. The apparent lack of differentiation of the CD8 + T cells may have important applications. For adoptive transfer of cellular immunotherapy, it is desirable to uncouple T-cell expansion from its differentiation [28] . We suggest that anti-CD46 should be further explored as a means to expand CD8 + T cells for such therapy. 3 . CD46 co-stimulation promotes proliferation of CD8 + T cells. Isolated CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, respectively, were incubated with CFSE and stimulated with either \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28 or \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD46 for 72 h. (A) Flow histograms of the CFSE fluorescence intensity in CD8 + and CD4 + T cells from a representative donor (n = 6 donors). (B) Frequency of proliferating cells represented as mean \u00b1 SD of 6 donors. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test, * p < 0.05. NA = no antibodies. Fig. 4 . CD46 co-stimulation expands IFN-\u03b3-producing CD8 + T cells. Isolated CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were stimulated with either \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD28 or \u03b1CD3/\u03b1CD46 for different time-periods as indicated, and analyzed by flow cytometry for the frequency of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10-producing cells using the IL-10 (PE) and IFN-\u03b3 (APC) Secretion Assay Detection Kit. Analyses applied gating for live cells. (A) Contour plot of a representative donor (n = 8 donors). NA = no antibodies.
