            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a member of the positive-strand RNA virus family Arteriviridae. Although considerable research has focused on this important pathogen, little is known about the function of most PRRSV proteins. To examine characteristics of putative nonstructural proteins (nsp) encoded in ORF1b, which have been identified by nucleotide similarity to domains of equine arteritis virus, defined genomic regions were cloned and expressed in the pRSET expression system. One region, nsp10, encoded a protein with a putative helicase domain and was further examined for functional helicase-like activities. PRRSV nsp10 was found to possess a thermolabile and pH-sensitive NTPase activity that was modulated by polynucleotides and to unwind dsRNA in a 5\u0408 to 3\u0408 polarity. These results provide the first evidence of the functional properties of PRRSV helicase and further support the finding that nidovirus helicases possess properties that distinguish them from other viral helicases. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science (USA)",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) emerged in the late 1980s and became a pathogen of scientific interest due to its economic importance. Analysis of PRRSV structure, genomic organization, and expression and its biological, physicochemical, and pathogenic properties has shown that PRRSV is related to equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenaseelevating virus of mice (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) Collins et al., 1992; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) . These viruses are grouped in a new family designated Arteriviridae and placed with the Coronaviridae family within the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997) . PRRSV has been revealed to consist of two distantly related genotypes, North American (NA, 15.4 kb) and European (EU, 15.1 kb), based on sequence analysis (Allende et al., 1999; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Murtaugh et al., 1995 Murtaugh et al., , 1998 Nelsen et al., 1999) . The genome of PRRSV encodes at least eight open reading frames (ORFs) that are expressed in the infected cell as a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. ORF1, translated from the full-length RNA template, codes for replicase-related nonstructural proteins and is the focus of this study. ORFs 2 to 7 encode mostly structural polypeptides. ORF1 contains two long open reading frames, designated ORF1a and ORF1b, that are autocatalytically processed by virally encoded proteases (Meulenberg et al., 1993) . ORF1b is only expressed by ribosomal \u03ea1 frame shifting due to a slippery sequence and pseudoknot structure in the overlapping ORF1a/ORF1b junction (Allende et al., 1999; den Boon et al., 1991; Brierly et al., 1989; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999; Wootton et al., 2000) . The catalytic domains and cleavage sites for EAV ORF1 have been identified. The EAV proteases, located within nsp1, nsp2, and nsp4, have been shown to cleave EAV ORF1ab into 12 nonstructural proteins (nsps), 8 in ORF1a and 4 in ORF1b (den Boon et al., 1995; Snijder et al., 1992 Snijder et al., , 1993a Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; van Dinten et al., 1996 . EAV nsp1 autocatalytically cleaves the ORF1 protein immediately downstream between G260 and G261; nsp2 is proposed to cleave far downstream between two glycine residues located at EAV amino acids 1367 and 1368, and nsp4, the major protease, cleaves ORF1 between amino acids glutamine and glycine (EG) or glutamine and serine (ES) (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . Based on significant homology in the catalytic domains and in predicted cleavage sites, it was surmised that PRRSV polymerase may undergo similar proteolytic processing as that of EAV (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; Wassenaar et al., 1997; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . The four predicted ORF1b nonstructural polypeptides comprise a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (POL or nsp9), a protein (nsp10) containing a putative metal-binding domain (MBD) and nucleoside triphos-phate binding or helicase motif (HEL), and two proteins of unknown function (nsp 11 and 12). Nsp11 contains a domain (CORONA) that is conserved in all nidoviruses (Allende et al., 1999 (Allende et al., , 2000 den Boon et al., 1991; Godeny et al., 1993; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Herold et al., 1996; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999; Shen et al., 2000; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; van Dinten et al., 1996 Wootton et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Despite extensive research on the molecular and biological properties of PRRSV, there are important aspects of the disease and biology that remain unclear. The role of the nonstructural genes encoded in ORF1ab in viral replication, pathogenesis, and immunity have not been demonstrated. This information is necessary to devise effective strategies to prevent and control PRRSV infection of swine. The knowledge available for the genes encoded in ORF1ab is limited to sequence information for a few virus isolates (Allende et al., 1999 (Allende et al., , 2000 Jiang et al., 2000; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999; Shen et al., 2000; Wootton et al., 2000) and predictions on their function based on sequence homology and studies on EAV and coronaviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Herold et al., 1996; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; . To elucidate the role of the nonstructural genes of arteriviruses in virus replication, previous studies have been done with EAV (12.7 kb) to develop and characterize infectious clones and their derivative mutants (de Vries et al., 2000; van Dinten et al., 1997 van Dinten et al., , 2000 van Marle, 1999) . These studies have provided important insights as to the critical role of the genes encoded in ORF1ab in arterivirus replication. However, PRRSV is genetically divergent from EAV, possessing only approximately 41% (ORF1a) to 48% (ORF1b) nucleotide identities to the sequenced EAV cell-adapted avirulent strain . In addition, infectious clones of PRRSV have been more difficult to prepare and analyze, apparently due to the increased genomic size of PRRSV (15.1-15.4 kb), the restricted cell tropism of this virus, and the difficulty in transforming these permissive cells with nucleic acids . We have chosen a virulent field isolate of PRRSV to explore phenotypic properties of this virus as it exists in nature. To demonstrate and characterize PRRSV ORF1b polypeptides, we have generated recombinant individual nsp proteins that were then analyzed under controlled conditions. This article describes the first functional studies of the putative PRRSV helicase.",

In addition, there was no ATPase activity observed in the absence of divalent ions (Fig.  5C ). Optimal ATPase activity was detected at 1-2 mM for all the four divalent ions tested. Whereas the level of ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase consistently remained stable over a broader range of MgCl 2 concentrations, increasing concentrations of MnSO 4 inhibited the activity in a dose-dependent manner and to a greater extent than the other divalent ions tested (Fig. 5C) . Lastly, the ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase was very sensitive to temperature. Optimal activity was detected between 25 and 30\u00b0C. The ATPase activity was significantly reduced at 37.5\u00b0C and was only detected at background levels at temperatures at and above 40\u00b0C and completely abolished at 60\u00b0C (Fig. 5D ). Kinetic analysis of recombinant helicase ATPase activity revealed dependence on time (Fig. 6A ) and substrate concentration (Fig. 6B) . The Michaelis-Menten constant (K M ) for the ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase was determined to lie in the range of 6-13 mM ATP, with a maximum velocity of 1.3-2 mM ATP hydrolyzed per min (Fig. 6C ).",

Poly(U) significantly enhanced the ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase at a given ATP level (Fig. 7A ). Although maximum velocity of enzymatic activity was not reached, comparison of the initial velocities of the relative ATPase activities showed that the presence of poly(U) increased the K M and V max at least 19-and 24fold, respectively. However, at low ATP concentrations, poly(U) did not have an effect or tended to reduce the ATPase activity ( Table 2 ). The fold increase in the level of ATP hydrolyzed induced by poly(U) was in a close linear proportion (r 2 \u03ed 0.9817) to the concentration of ATP substrate (Fig. 7B) . These data indicate that the effect of polynucleotides on the ATPase activity of PRRSV is dependent on ATP substrate concentration. This result also explains our initial findings (Fig. 4) , in which no apparent effect of the polynucleotides was detected when the ATP concentration was limited and the level of ATPase activity present in the assay was nearly 100% of the substrate.",

In addition, we confirmed that the measurement of ATP by the bioluminescence method was not affected by the presence of CTP, GTP, or UTP (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 8 , CTP, GTP, and UTP inhibited the level of ATP hydrolysis by PRRSV helicase only when they were present at concentrations at least 10-fold higher than the ATP substrate.

These substrates consisted of two partially complementary RNA strands containing single-stranded (ss) regions at the 3\u0408 or 5\u0408 ends of one or both strands. One set of substrates designed to contain single-strand regions at both 3\u0408 and 5\u0408 ends did not initially form the expected partial duplex structures under initial hybridiza-tion conditions. One explanation is that these long oligonucleotides are predicted to form secondary structures (energies of \u03ea25 to \u03ea30 kcal/mol; data not shown) and therefore might not have initially annealed to the other strand. However, duplexes or other higher ordered structures appear to form in the presence of recombinant helicase (data not shown). One suggestion for this result is that PRRSV helicase first promoted unwinding of initial interoligonucleotide structures, then winding to form the expected duplexes, and/or introducing secondary structures in the labeled RNA strand.",

The 5\u0408-to-3\u0408 orientation of the unwinding activity of the PRRSV helicase was further confirmed in experiments using substrates prepared with in vitro transcribed RNA that contained singlestrand regions at the 5\u0408 end of both strands and duplex regions of 67 bp (5\u04085\u0408Duplex #1) and 85 bp (5\u04085\u0408Duplex #2), as shown in Fig. 9B .

The described studies demonstrated that the predicted nsp10 product containing the metal binding and NTPase-helicase domains of PRRSV ORF1b has NTPase activity. The initial NTPase analysis, determined by thin-layer chromatography, revealed that PRRSV helicase hydrolyzes the four ribonucleotides in the absence of polynucleotides. The interaction of the recombinant PRRSV helicase with the nucleotides was confirmed by demonstrating that the presence of excess GTP, CTP, and UTP inhibited the level of ATP hydrolysis. The ability of PRRSV helicase to catalyze hydrolysis of different nucleotides is a characteristic shared by various reported viral helicases (Bisaillon et al., 1997; Kadare et al., 1996; Li et al., 1999; Preugschat et al., 1996; Rikkonen et al., 1994) . We demonstrated that the activity observed for the recombinant his-tagged nsp 10 is specific for the helicase because the recombinant PRRSV ORF1b nsp11 and nsp12 polypeptides that were expressed and purified under the same conditions as PRRSV helicase did not have specific ATPase activity. Although ATPase activity has been previously reported for the human coronavirus 229E helicase (Heussip et al., 1997; Seybert et al., 2000a) , a member of the order Nidovirales, and more recently for EAV (Seybert et al., 2000b) , this is the first study reporting the characterization of the NTPase activity of the putative helicase of PRRSV.",

In contrast to other viral helicases (Bisaillon et al., 1997) , PRRSV helicase appears to be extremely sensitive to temperatures above physiological levels. This finding suggests that viral or cellular factors may be required to stabilize PRRSV helicase function. The ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase was also dependent 9 . PRRSV helicase activities. RNA substrates were generated by annealing two partially complementary RNA strands for use in a standard helicase (hel) assay.

Interestingly, the effect of poly(U) in the ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase was dependent on the substrate concentration. At ATP concentrations lower than the estimated K M , poly(U) had an inhibitory effect, whereas at higher ATP concentrations, poly(U) had a stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase.

            "text": "The substrate concentration-dependent modulatory effect of polynucleotides on the ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase found in this study has not been previously described. Data reported for other viral helicases are consistent with a stimulatory effect that varies depending on the type of helicase and polynucleotide used (Rikkonen et al., 1994; Tamura et al., 1993) . The level of nucleic acid stimulation reported for the known members of the viral SF1 and SF3 helicases has only been in the range of a twofold increase, whereas higher levels of stimulation have been reported for SF2 helicases (Kadare and Haenni, 1997) . The ATPase activity of the human coronavirus 229E, which belongs to the same Nidovirales order as PRRSV, was found to be highly stimulated with polynucleotides and the major stimulatory effect was found with poly(U), which increased the NTPase activity of the helicase up to 50-fold (Heusipp et al., 1997; Seybert et al., 2000a) . A 20-fold increase in the ATPase activity by polynucleotides was found for the EAV helicase (Seybert et al., 2000b) . For PRRSV helicase we found that whereas the overall effect of poly(U) on the K M and V max reached levels of 19-and 24-fold increase, respectively, the effect on the amount of ATP hydrolyzed varied from \u03f30.6-fold (at 0.3 M ATP substrate) to 6.5fold (at 100 M ATP substrate). Experimental data analyzing the effect of polynucleotides under the range of ATP substrate concentrations used in this study have not been reported for other viral helicases. Therefore, it is not clear whether our findings represent a unique feature of PRRSV helicase. We suggest that the modulatory effect of poly(U) on the ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase discovered in this study may have biological relevance regarding virus replication and gene expression. It is tempting to speculate that if PRRSV helicase is involved in the processes of its genome replication and transcription, as suggested by the studies with the mutant EAV infectious clones (van Dinten et al., 1997 (van Dinten et al., , 2000 van Marle et al., 1999) , PRRSV helicase needs to be regulated to achieve a balance between nucleotide hydrolysis and viral RNA synthesis. Analysis of the crystal structure of PRRSV helicase will be important to determine whether the regulatory effect of polynucleotides in the ATPase activity of PRRSV helicase is dependent on conformational changes differentially induced by various ratios of ATP substrate to polynucleotide bound to the protein.",

Four CH clones (CH2, CH11, CH18, and CH37) were confirmed for proper frame and orientation by restriction digest and sequence analysis. The CH2 clone was used as a template for further ORF1b nsp gene subcloning. Gene fragments encoding predicted ORF1b nsps (nsp 9 to 12) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCRBlunt vector using PRRSV-14-specific primers (Table 3 ) designed to contain restriction sites for cloning into the prokaryotic pRSET-B expression vector (Invitrogen). pRSET-B bacterial expression vector cloning was performed following standard techniques (Sambrook, 1989) . Briefly, the gene fragments were inserted into the BamHI and KpnI sites of the pRSET. The recombinant pRSET plasmids containing ORF1b nsp genes were confirmed for proper orientation and frame by enzymatic restriction analysis and by sequencing the region at the insertion sites. The recombinant plasmids were designated pT-prrsvnspN, where N corresponded to the number of the cloned ORF1b nsp.",

ORF1b nsps were expressed as recombinant proteins attached at their amino-terminus to a tag containing a polyhistidine peptide, the antigenic peptide T7.10, and an enterokinase cleavage site. Ten to fifty nanograms of recombinant pRSET-B plasmid DNA containing the corresponding ORF1b fragments were placed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS-or BL21(DE3)pLysE-competent cells by bacterial transformation following the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). Expression of soluble recombinant proteins was optimized by culturing transformed bacterial clones at various temperatures, in different culture media, and by varying IPTG-induction times. Recombinant protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis of crude protein extracts with a chemiluminescence detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim) using selected antibodies, including a monoclonal antibody to the polyhistidine peptide (Clontech), a T7.10 tag antibody (Novagen), and peptide-specific polyclonal antisera generated to PRRSV-14 nsp 9, 10, and 11 (described below). After optimal conditions were determined, soluble recombinant proteins were purified from bacterial extracts by affinity to cobalt (Novagen) or Ni-NTA (Qiagen) resins according the manufacturer's recommendations. Recombinant proteins were eluted with 300 mM imidazole. Eluted fractions were subjected to electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie blue staining, and Western blot analysis. Fractions containing the purified recombinant protein of interest were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 1% glycerol and 1 mM DTT. Purified proteins were stored at \u03ea20\u00b0C until further analysis.

This assay was performed in triplicate at conditions described above (10-l reactions) with 0.1 to 1 M ATP (Promega) as substrate. For kinetic analysis, the level of ATP hydrolysis produced by the recombinant nsp 10 helicase was measured at different concentrations of ATP and at various incubation times. After incubation, the helicase was inactivated at 90\u00b0C for 5 min and samples were diluted with 19 vol of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 buffer containing 2 mM EDTA.
