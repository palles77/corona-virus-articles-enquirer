Furthermore, many viral zoonoses have emerged or reemerged in recent years, highlighting the importance of such diseases. Emerging viral zoonoses encompass a vast number of different viruses and many different transmission modes. There are many factors influencing the epidemiology of the various zoonoses, such as ecological changes, changes in agriculture and food production, the movement of pathogens, including via travel and trade, human behavior and demographical factors, and microbial changes and adaptation. Costeffective prevention and control of emerging viral zoonoses necessitates an interdisciplinary and holistic approach and international cooperation. Surveillance, laboratory capability, research, training and education, and last but not least, information and communication are key elements.",

Such diseases were formerly called anthropozoonoses (Greek ''anthro\u00b4pos'' \u00bc man, ''zoon'' \u00bc animal, ''nosos'' \u00bc disease), whereas the diseases transmissible from humans to animals were called zooanthroponoses (Huba\u00b4lek, 2003) . Today, the term zoonoses is commonly used for infectious diseases that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man (WHO/FAO, 1959) . The total number of zoonoses is unknown, but according to Taylor et al. (2001) , who in 2001 cataloged 1415 known human pathogens, including 217 viruses and prions, 538 bacteria and rickettsia, 307 fungi, 66 protozoa, and 287 helminths, 61% were zoonotic. With time, more and more human pathogens are found to be of animal origin. Interestingly, wild animals seem to be involved in the epidemiology of most zoonoses and serve as significant reservoirs for transmission of zoonotic agents to domestic animals and man.",

Influenza viruses have different hosts, both birds and different mammals including humans, and have a zoonotic potential. An antigenic shift in influenza A virus can cause the sudden emergence of a new subtype of the virus. Although this shift occurs only occasionally, large numbers of people, and sometimes the entire population, have no antibody protection against the new subtype of virus, resulting in a worldwide epidemic (''pandemic''). Three major influenza A pandemics emerged during the 20th century. Of these, the Spanish flu in 1918-1919 (subtype H1N1) was the most severe with an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006) . The Asian flu in 1957-1958 (H2N2) and the Hong Kong flu in 1968-1969 (H3N2) caused less serious pandemics. The latter two are known to be the result of a reassortment between an avian influenza strain from wild waterfowl and a human strain of influenza A, with the introduction of a new hemagglutinin protein in the human strain.",

Mosquitoes are the most important arthropod vectors (examples of viral zoonoses transmitted by mosquitoes are Rift Valley fever, WNV, and Japanese encephalitis), followed by ticks, sandflies, and midges. Arthropod vector-borne viruses are called arboviruses and are maintained in complex life cycles involving a non-human vertebrate primary host and a primary arthropod vector. The arthropod vector becomes infected when it ingests virus while feeding on the blood of a viremic animal. Virus replicates in the arthropod tissues, ultimately infecting the salivary glands. The arthropod then transmits the virus to a new host when it injects infectious salivary fluid while taking a blood meal. Arthropod-borne viruses generally remain undetected until the virus escapes the primary cycle via a secondary vector or secondary vertebrate host, such as when humans enter the enzootic cycle. Although humans may become ill as a result of these viruses, they are generally considered dead-end hosts for many of the viruses because they do not develop sufficient viremia to infect feeding vectors and thus do not contribute to the transmission cycle. Notable exceptions include dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Ross River virus infections (www.acpmedicine.com/sample2/ch0731s.htm).",

Meteorological factors such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity can influence the dynamics of vector-borne diseases. Climate changes with milder winters and early arrival of spring has been suggested as an explanation for the increased incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in Sweden (Lindgren and Gustafson, 2001) . There are indications that warmer temperatures aid dengue virus transmission by accelerating development of the larvae of the mosquito vector, Aedes egypti, whose range is limited by cold weather.

Clearing of forested land in Bolivia in the early 1960s was accompanied by blanket spraying of DDT to control malaria-bearing mosquitoes, and incidentally killed many village cats leading to decreased control of mice near human populations. Large areas with maize supported huge populations of Calomys mice carrying Machupo virus; this resulted in the appearance of the Bolivian hemorrhagic fever with a high fatality rate (McMichael, 2004) .

Infection of humans has also been documented to have occurred as a result of handling infected chimpanzees and gorillas found dead in the rainforests, which suggests that they are not a reservoir since they die from the infection. Interestingly, bats experimentally infected with Ebola virus do not die. Furthermore, evidence of asymptomatic Ebola virus infection was found in three species of fruit bats collected during Ebola outbreaks in humans and great apes between 2001 and 2003 in Gabon and DRC. This evidence that fruit bats may be acting as reservoirs for Ebola virus supports previous evidence suggesting bats as candidate reservoirs for Ebola virus and the closely related Marburg virus (Leroy et al., 2005) .

The ecological trigger for the Nipah virus outbreak appears to have been a complex series of alterations to the fruit bat habitat caused by human activities including agriculture, in combination with a period of drought. The fruit bat's habitat was largely replaced in peninsular Malaysia by oil palm plantations. Deforestation in Sumatra, coupled with a serious drought and fires caused by a major El Nino-event in 1997, led to significant air-pollution haze that covered large areas in Malaysia and parts of Southeast Asia. This reduced the flowering of forest trees and caused a marked decline in forest fruit production, resulting in the encroachment of bats into fruit plantations where pig farms were also maintained . The culling of hundreds of thousands of pigs probably stopped the Nipah virus epidemic; human-to-human transmission has not been demonstrated.",

The cases in the United States, the first outside Africa, were associated with contact with infected prairie dogs.

In January 2006, the first human cases of H5N1 infection in Europe were confirmed; fatal human cases occurred in Turkey, and were associated with contact with diseased poultry (www.who.int/csr/disease/ avian_influenza/avianinfluenza_factsheetJan2006/en/index.html). It is believed that H5N1 reached Europe from Asia by means of migratory birds. Wild waterfowl are the natural reservoirs of influenza A viruses, but they usually do not get sick from them. H5N1 in its highly pathogenic form has been isolated from dead migratory birds . This finding may suggest a role for migratory waterfowl in the evolution and maintenance of highly pathogenic H5N1. The role of imported infected wild birds was demonstrated in October 2005, when two smuggled hawk eagles carried on a flight from Thailand to Belgium tested positive for H5N1 (WHO, 2005) , and when a parrot imported from Surinam to the United Kingdom was found positive for H5N1 (www.defra.gov.uk/news/latest/2005/animal-1024.htm).",

HIV-1 consists of three distinct groups (M, N, and O), with group M being responsible for the majority of HIV infections worldwide. HIV-2 is represented by six subtypes, A-F. Current molecular biological evidence indicates that the SIV counterparts of HIV-1 and HIV-2 have been transmitted into the human population on several occasions from two distinct primate sources: HIV-1 from the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes (from the virus SIVcpz) and HIV-2 from the sooty mangabey monkey Cercocebus atys (virus SIVsm) (Gao et al., 1999; Hahn et al., 2000; Sharp et al., 2001) . Since the three groups of HIV-1 (M, N, and O) genetically differ as much from each other as do different SIVcpz genomes, it is believed that they are each derived from a separate zoonotic transmission. Likewise, for HIV-2 there may have been six separate crossover events from sooty mangabeys to humans.",

In contrast, no Asian primate species has been reported to harbor SIV in the wild (Sharp et al., 2001) ; for instance, rhesus macaques do not seem to be naturally infected with SIV. However, cross-species transmission of the strain SIVsm from sooty mangabey to an ''unnatural host'', the macaque, results in immunosuppression and an AIDS-like disease in the macaque.

Yet, despite centuries of opportunity to emerge as infections in humans, there is no evidence to suggest that HIV existed in Africa prior to the 20th century. Moreover, the chimpanzee and the sooty mangabey hosts are not found in the same areas in Africa, but exist in widely separated, non-contiguous regions (Marx et al., 2001) . To explain the almost simultaneous emergence of HIV-1 and HIV-2, occurring in different parts of Africa, Marx et al. (2001) suggested that a massive increase in unsterile medical injections may have served to increase the probability of serial transmission of partially adapted SIV infections in humans, particularly as a result of the general availability of penicillin beginning in the early 1950s. According to this theory, serial passage of partially adapted SIV between humans resulted in a cumulative series of mutations and the emergence of epidemic HIV strains. The AIDS epidemic in Romania is a documented example of the role that unsterile injections can play in the serial transmission of HIV. Before December 1989, 13 AIDS cases were identified in Romania as reported to the WHO. By December 31, 1990, almost 1200 cases were reported, of which 94% occurred in children o13 years of age. Almost 60% of those children had acquired HIV infection from unsterilized medicinal use of needles and syringes (Hersh et al., 1991) .",

Several infections of humans by SFVs, which will not lead to further human-to-human transmission, have been documented. In the human host, the SFV remains mainly in its integrated proviral form and there is no detectable virus replication. Other zoonotic pathogens have also led to several small human epidemics with little or no evidence of human-tohuman transmission. This phenomenon has been termed ''viral chatter'' and is probably an important mechanism in viral emergence (Wolfe et al., 2005b) . High rates of viral chatter increase the diversity of virus sequence variants moving into humans and form a basis for accumulation of genetic changes that may result in adaptation to the new host.",

As a consequence, RNA viruses generally evolve more rapidly and lead to genetic heterogeneity, which can be seen as the presence of viral quasispecies. This means that, in the infected individual, the virus exists as a population of genetically related but divergent variants, of which the most common variant is a ''master sequence''. While the master sequence remains the dominant one, the spectrum of mutants may shift in response to selective pressure and any variant may be selectively expanded (Domingo and Holland, 1997) .

Surveillance and characterization of the circulating strains are important in determining whether an available influenza vaccine will give protection or not. Influenza viruses are classified into types A, B, and C, of which types B and C are specific to humans, whereas type A viruses can have different hosts, both birds and different mammals including humans. There are only three A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) known to be currently circulating among humans as seasonal influenza. The seasonal influenza epidemics occur as a result of genetic drift, the accumulation of point mutations that occur due to lack of proofreading (Webster et al., 1992) . Antigenic shift, an abrupt change in the hemagglutinin and/or the neuraminidase proteins of the virus, causes the sudden emergence of a new subtype of a type A virus that is antigenically distinct from former circulating influenza A viruses. The new virus is potentially capable of causing an epidemic in an immunologically na\u0131\u00a8ve human population (Webster et al., 1992) . Worldwide epidemics, called pandemics, occur only occasionally. To date, human infections with avian influenza A have not resulted in sustained human-to-human transmissions, although in certain instances transmission to family members cannot be ruled out (www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/avian-flu-humans).",

(The RBD of coronaviruses is located in the spike protein (S). Trimers of the S-protein bind to the specific cellular receptor, which for the SARS virus is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); Prabakaran et al., 2004.) Only four amino acids differ between the human and the civet strains, but the human viral S-protein binds the human receptor 1000-10, 000 times more tightly than does its civet S-protein counterpart. The intimate interface between a loop of the S-protein of viruses from the SARS epidemic in 2002-2003 and human ACE2 mediates efficient binding and infection of the cell, which probably is a key factor in determining the severity and possibly human-to-human transmission . In contrast, S-protein from viruses of sporadic SARS cases in 2003 and 2004, each of which was an independent cross-species event with no further human-to-human transmission, had amino acids that more closely resembled the civet virus. The outcome was a reduced binding to human ACE2 and less efficient infection. Epidemiological investigation of the 2003 and 2004 SARS cases showed that SARS-CoV-positive palm civets, kept alive in cages close to the customers while waiting to be prepared as dinners in a restaurant, were the source for transmission to a waitress working in the restaurant and to a customer eating there .",

            "text": "The origin of the HIV-1 pandemic has been traced to the SIVcpz virus of chimpanzees (identified in two chimpanzee subspecies, P. troglodytes troglodytes and P. troglodyte schweinfurthii, but not in the third species, P. troglodytes verus). Speciesspecific strains of SIV (like SIVsm and SIVagm) have been identified in more than 30 African primate species, but all except SIVcpz infect monkeys. SIVs seem to be non-pathogenic in the vast majority of natural hosts despite high levels of virus replication (Apetrei et al., 2004) . This may be a consequence of the fact that the incubation period of the disease generally exceeds the life span of the host. SIVs also have a high propensity for cross-species transmission. SIV phylogeny is complex and analyses indicate recombination among viruses from different major lineages. Of the identified recombinants, SIVcpz so far represents the most important one, being the source of the HIV-1 pandemic. SIVrcm from red-capped mangabeys and SIVgsn from greater spot-nosed monkeys are most closely related to SIVcpz, but they are similar only in certain regions of the genome that do not overlap. Extensive phylogenetic analyses of subsets of SIV strains comparing the topologies among four regions of the proteome have provided evidence for a more recent origin of SIVcpz than of other strains, being a result of recombination between ancestors of SIVgsn and SIVrcm (Bailes et al., 2003) . The geographic region of these two monkey species overlaps that of the chimpanzee and it is known that chimpanzees hunt smaller monkeys for food. The founder chimpanzee most likely was infected by one of the ancestor SIVs and thereafter became superinfected by the other ancestor virus, leading to recombination in a doubly infected cell. The hybrid origin of SIVcpz, in contrast to SIVsm (from which HIV-2 is derived), has several important implications. First, it provides evidence that, in addition to humans, another primate species can acquire cross-species transmission under natural conditions. Second, the hybrid virus had adapted to the host and established substantial secondary spread within the species. Third, the chimpanzee virus was capable of spreading to humans. Moreover, the chimpanzee most likely acquired SIV-infection relatively recently, subsequent to the split of the chimpanzee into two subspecies, since SIVcpz has not been found in the third chimpanzee subspecies, P. troglodytes verus.",

One is the integration of the reversely transcribed provirus into the cellular genome, causing a life-long infection. Another is the potential for superinfection, in which recombination may occur when a cell becomes infected with two genetically distinct viruses. During reverse transcription, the reverse transcriptase can switch from one RNA template to the other, thereby generating a progeny that is a mosaic of the parent viruses (Preston et al., 1988) . HIV-1 genomes with this kind of mosaic structure are called circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). There are an increasing number of such CRFs identified; CRF 01_AE is mainly responsible for the HIV epidemic in Southeast Asia (Takebe et al., 2003; Watanaveeradej et al., 2003) . These CRFs now constitute 10-20% of newly characterized circulating strains (Perrin et al., 2003) .",

The role of bats in the etiology of many viral zoonoses illustrates the challenges of prevention and control (Dobson, 2005) . Bats represent a reservoir of rabies, Hendra, Menangle, and Nipah viruses. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that bats may be the wildlife reservoir of Ebola virus and one of the reservoirs of SARS-CoV (Leroy et al., 2005; . Although SARS-CoV isolated from humans appeared to derive from a nearly identical virus circulating in masked palm civets and racoon dogs Song et al., 2005) , subsequent studies did not reveal widespread infection in wild or farmed civets, and experimental infection of civets with human SARS-CoV resulted in overt clinical symptoms suggesting that they are not the reservoir. A recent large study of different bat species from four locations in China showed a high prevalence and wide distribution of SARS-CoV-seropositive bats (Lau et al., 2005; . Although horseshoe bats appear to be the natural reservoir of a SARS-like corona virus (SL-CoV), it is not clear how this virus could have got from the bat or another reservoir to humans. The human and civet isolates of SARS-CoV are phylogenetically located within the spectrum of these SL-CoVs. One possibility is that bats passed the virus to civets or to other animals in the wild or in the live animal markets of southern China.",
