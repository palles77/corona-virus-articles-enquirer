The symptomatic overlap between febrile diseases impedes their diagnosis on clinical grounds. Therefore, the World Health Organization promotes an integrated management of febrile illness. Along this line, we present an overview of endemic and epidemic etiologies of fever and state-of-the-art diagnostic tools used in the field. It becomes evident that there is an urgent need for the development of novel technologies to fulfill end-users' requirements. This need can be met with point-of-care and near-patient diagnostic platforms, as well as e-Health clinical algorithms, which co-assess test results with key clinical elements and biosensors, assisting clinicians in patient triage and management, thus enhancing disease surveillance and outbreak alerts. This review gives an overview of diagnostic technologies featuring a platform based approach: (i) assay (nucleic acid amplification technologies are examined); (ii) cartridge (microfluidic technologies are presented); (iii) instrument (various detection technologies are discussed); and at the end proposes a way that such technologies can be interfaced with electronic clinical decision-making algorithms towards a broad and complete diagnostic ecosystem.",

A combination of factors leads to the perpetuation of this situation, including the tropical climate, the simultaneous presentation of multiple diseases, innate or acquired host factors (micronutrient deficiency, immunodeficiency, co-morbidities), lack of resources (low income) to procure medicines and vaccines or other preventive tools, lack/misuse (due to lack of training or information) of (suitable) diagnostic tools, increase of pathogen resistance to antimicrobial medicines, as well as social and community factors. As a result, in 2010, 64% of deaths worldwide were still due to infectious diseases; pneumonia, malaria, and sepsis were the leading causes of death, particularly in Africa [1] . Moreover, while the borders between tropical diseases -thought to be confined around the equator (such as Ebola) -and infectious diseases classically related to Northern countries (such as influenza) were discrete, climate change and the increase in population migration contributed to a blurring of these borders, thus making the spread of febrile illnesses a global reality and concern.",

Even though the distribution of fevercausing diseases varies by geography, season, age and immunity of patients and the level of care, some findings were similar among studies [2] . These were related to cosmopolitan diseases found in most places worldwide, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection. For other diseases, with various levels of endemicity, such as typhoid or rickettsiosis, or that occur rather in an epidemic way, such as arbovirus infections, the prevalence varied significantly according to the geographic location and, even more, according to the season or the calendar year. In studies that have recorded the clinical presentation of patients (and not only their laboratory results), the causes of fever in outpatients could be classified into four main syndromes: 1) acute respiratory infections (ARI, of any type); 2) diarrhea (gastroenteritis); 3) fever with another clear focus (e.g. meningitis or skin infection); and 4) non-specific fevers [13] (each diagnostic platform described in Section 5 focuses on at least one of the aforementioned cases). Even though important diagnostic challenges remain regarding the first three syndromes, clear clinical guidelines have been developed by WHO, such as the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness -IMCI [14] , to help clinicians to assess their patients and to decide on their treatment. Because they correspond to localized infections, these syndromes are generally diagnosed using the best available clinical predictors, while diagnostic tools are indeed not included. In contrast, regarding the 4th syndrome (non-specific fevers), very few guidelines are available.",

Malaria prevalence varies widely, from 0 to 32% of all fevers. Indeed, the decrease in malaria transmission in many places in Africa [20, 21] has led to significant heterogeneity in transmission. The prevalence of malaria among patients with febrile illness has, therefore, become unpredictable and has triggered the switch of the WHO malaria case management policy from presumptive treatment, to treatment based on laboratory confirmation [8] . (ii) Urinary tract infection was an important cause of fever in young children (generally younger than two years old) that cannot be suspected on the basis of a history of urinary symptoms at that age (and therefore, it is included in the category of non-specific fevers). The prevalence among all children under five with febrile illness was 1-6%. (iii) Enteric fever was a significant cause of fever in children older than two years old and in adults, accounting for 2-10% of all fevers, with Salmonella typhi being the most frequent pathogen identified, followed by Salmonella non-typhi. (iv) Other bloodstream infections, mainly due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, accounted for about 2% of all fevers. Other systemic bacterial diseases, such as leptospirosis (0.2-13%), rickettsiosis (1-25%), Q fever (1-8%), and brucellosis (5%) were also important causes of fever, especially in adults who were more exposed to zoonoses and other environmental-related diseases than children. (v) Dengue was also an important cause and seemed to emerge in several African countries. Its prevalence is extremely variable, not so much geographically but temporally (seasonal and year to year variation). (vi) Cosmopolitan viruses, such as Human herpesvirus 6, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr virus, and Cytomegalovirus, which are transmitted mainly through close contact within family members, were mostly prevalent in children, accounting for 9% of all fevers and 22% of non-specific fevers in children [13] , while adults were more susceptible to vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya or West Nile virus. Acute HIV was found in a few patients. (vii) Co-infection with two or even more pathogens was frequent (in one study, 23% of pediatric patients had more than one disease simultaneously, Fig. 2 ), especially when an outbreak overlapped with an endemic situation, as it happened in a fever study in Tanzania in 2013. Suddenly, in January 2014, a significant outbreak of dengue started, and at the peak of the epidemic, almost 80% of patients presenting with fever were infected with dengue virus of serotype 2 [6] . Because of the absence of diagnostic tools outside the study sites, most of these patients were considered as malaria cases and treated with antimalarial medicines or, in case that malaria tests where available, they were considered as possibly infected by bacteria and treated with antibiotics. (viii) Regarding HIV, chronic HIV is an important co-morbidity, especially for adults (40% were positive in two Tanzanian studies, while HIV prevalence in the corresponding community was 5 to 10%), and should, thus, be systematically screened for, which is unfortunately not the case presently in Africa.",

Objective point-of-care (POC) biosensors (such as oximeters), in addition to the subjective assessment of clinical danger signs (such as lethargy or severe dehydration), are helpful to correctly triage patients and should be integrated in the evaluation process [23] . When patients present with a mild disease, ambulatory management with appropriate home-based treatment is sufficient [24, 25] . The main challenge is then to identify the few patients who will benefit from antimicrobial treatment among all those with self-limited infection. Presumptive treatment with antimicrobials should be avoided as most of these infections are of viral origin (Fig. 2) , especially in children (except for malaria that can be ruled out by a rapid diagnostic test). Follow-up of patients to detect persistent or new symptoms and signs will then allow for the detection of rare clinical failures. At the primary care level, the decision to administer an antimicrobial should be based on an initial classification of the condition in the four categories mentioned in Section 2.2, combined with an accurate test specific for each syndrome that can distinguish between bacterial and viral etiology. As the existing host biomarkers lack accuracy (for example, C-reactive protein to identify the few bacterial pneumonia cases among the many viral respiratory infections), they should be combined with clinical predictors (e.g. fast breathing [26] ) to improve the overall specificity [23] .",

In sepsis, the symptoms and signs are indeed often unspecific to allow for initial classification into the four syndromes mentioned in Section 2.2 and all possibilities should be considered [15] . Under these conditions, accurate laboratory diagnosis is important, and the infections listed in Section 2.2 (taking into account specific exposures mentioned by the patients and the local epidemiology) should be tested for, whenever possible. The results of the laboratory tests should then still be interpreted in the clinical context, i.e. the pre-test probability of the disease and the likelihood ratios of clinical predictors. Indeed, for laboratory tests that have imperfect accuracy, these elements should be considered to calculate the post-test probability and be able to safely include or exclude certain diseases [27] . If this probability is above the \"treatment threshold\" (above which one treats the patients instead of continuing investigating them using tests), the appropriate antimicrobial should be administered [28] . If the probability is below the diagnostic threshold, no specific treatment is required, besides adjunctive treatment (e.g. i.e. acute respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, skin infections, meningitis and naso-pharyngeal infections (infections due to enterovirus, adenovirus or influenza, however presenting without any respiratory symptom).

In practice, antimicrobials are often administered presumptively while waiting for the test results (except for malaria that can be excluded in < 15 min based on the results of a rapid test). In summary, evidence-based integrated management of fever is a complex process, both at hospital and primary care levels, that would clearly benefit from electronic clinical decision algorithms (eCDA) based on mobile technology [23, 29, 30] to guide clinicians through the necessary steps, reach an accurate evaluation of the disease probability, and decide on the most appropriate treatment and management. Electronic clinical decision algorithms are e-Health tools pertaining to the broader category of \"computerized decision support systems\" (CDSS). Contrary to differential diagnosis generators (DDx) that provide a long list of possible diagnoses and have shown poor accuracy [31] , eCDA provide structured decision pathways that align with the clinician's workflow and guide the clinician throughout the consultation, including on final treatments and advice (Section 6).",

These criteria were initially developed for sexually transmitted infections but are generic for developing countries-targeted diagnostics. However, it has been evident that the users' requirements call for elaboration (or \"fine-tuning\") of these criteria. For example, the \"equipment-free\" criterion may be risky, because saving the test results in the device decreases the risk of mis-interpretation by inexperienced personnel. Therefore, there is an increasing trend to use mobile technology to read results provided by Lateral Flow Tests (LFTs). Moreover, there is need for guidance on how to select patients who should be tested, interpret test results in the clinical context, and triage patients who should be referred and admitted due to severe illness. In case of epidemics, where several patients arrive simultaneously at the checkpoint, the capacity of the tool to process several samples at the same time is an advantage. The ASSURED criteria, together with additional specific requirements, are summarized in Target Product Profiles (TPPs), which technology developers should meet during their development stages. Examples of TPPs exist for tuberculosis, Ebola, and differentiation between viral and bacterial infections, and are driven by the WHO, the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), and other organizations [36, 37] .

Indeed, the main general drawback of blood culture is the inability, except for a few cases, to diagnose localized infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection. For typhoid, in addition to blood culture, stool culture and/or bone marrow culture are used but are rarely available. Other limitations are that cultures take several days to provide results and that collection of high quality samples from pediatric patients is rather difficult and often leads to false results [42, 43] . In adults, sensitivity of blood culture is limited by the low bacterial load.

A more promising approach is the use of smartphones, which has several advantages over other systems to: (i) become increasingly accessible in Africa; (ii) be used as an image processing device with the built-in camera and suitable software; (iii) be able to support an application (APP) for processing the acquired data; and (iv) enable Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking of patients during an epidemic (following the appropriate ethics rules and after related permissions). Furthermore, data storage and transmission to external databases offers a high added value to LFTs. The camera can also typically scan 1-or 2-D barcodes on the LFT cassette in order to identify the type of test. To this direction, the non-profit global health organization \"Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases (GSID)\" [48] is developing a mobile tool to read, digitize, and transmit POC diagnostic results for important infectious diseases. In cooperation with the University of Washington (Seattle, USA) and Dimagi (Boston, USA), GSID developed an open-source software to capture the results of many different POC tests and report them immediately via wireless technology. A proof-of-concept study was conducted in Zimbabwe in 2014 [49] . Other examples of this approach are the mReader of mobile assay (USA), the AssayQuest\u2122 from Clearbridge BioLoc (Singapore), and the SkanSmart and SkanEasy products from Skannex (Norway). Extensive work on this field has been performed regarding software development, for example by Novarum DX\u2122 (UK), or the CommCare mobile platform by Dimagi (USA). Due to the relatively low complexity in manufacturing LFTs, there are > 100 manufacturers worldwide for clinical applications (which is why we are not able to provide a list of these manufacturers). The average price of an LFT is approximately US$1. Several studies assessed the performance of LFTs [50] [51] [52] [53] and in a non-exhaustive list of infections, LFTs currently exist for malaria, dengue, typhoid, HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and recently Ebola and Lassa [47] .",

Also, the dynamics of IgM/IgG can be complex and hard to interpret, especially when re-infection is possible (e.g. dengue).

These methods are less energy consuming than PCR and can be potentially executed in battery or solar panel operated devices, which is an important advantage for their application at the point of care. Furthermore, as a consequence of continuous amplification rather than cycling, the reaction will often generate detectable products faster than PCR. A disadvantage of iNAATs is in general (not referring to specific methods) that quantitation is difficult as they do not follow a strictly controllable reaction scheme.

NASBA reaction is facilitated by three enzymes (avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and T7 RNA polymerase) leading to the amplification product. In brief, during the amplification process, cDNA is initially produced from RNA templates through primer (primer 1) annealing to the template RNA and reverse transcription forming a cDNA from the latter. During cDNA production, RNase H hydrolyzes the RNA template. The resulting cDNA with the promoter sequence is annealed to a second primer (primer 2) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is produced with reverse transcription. Following this step, T7 RNA polymerase transcribes an RNA molecule from the previously generated dsDNA. The above procedure is cyclic and in each round the number of produced RNA is increased. A unique advantage of this method is that it can selectively amplify RNA in the presence of high DNA background, while the process can also start with a DNA template. In this case, the RNase H step in the non-cyclic phase is not necessary. With NASBA, amplification of a nucleic acid sequence to > 10 9 copies can be accomplished in~90 min.",

Thermal denaturation of dsDNA is not required, as the polymerase itself can denature dsDNA prior to elongation. Due to the reaction temperatures employed (60-65\u00b0C), dsDNA is in a metastable condition and the structure may hybridize/dehybridize spontaneously. This enables primers to bind to the template DNA in melted regions. Six primers are used resulting in high specificity. The forward (F3) and backward (B3) primers, together with the forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP), generate an artificial starting structure with single-stranded loop regions in each end. Based on this \"dumb-bell\" structure, a cauliflower-like structure is generated with the FIP and BIP primers binding at the loop region. Loop primers (LF, LB) may help to decrease the reaction time [62] . This process results in very fast generation of dsDNA products that can be detected either with intercalating dyes or with specific probes [63] in potentially < 10 min. In short, LAMP is advantageous due to: (i) high specificity, through the use of a minimum of four primers that define six binding sites on the target; (ii) sensitivity equal to, or higher than PCR; (iii) robustness against inhibiting compounds.",

The main cost driver in NAATs is typically the amplification enzyme (the polymerase). Cost further increases when viral RNA should be amplified and a reverse transcriptase should be incorporated in the reaction mix. In the case of some iNAATs, the assay design can be very complicated; for example, primer design in LAMP or the simultaneous use of three enzymes, as required in NASBA. Costs increase further, when enzymes are not pre-stored in liquid, but in dry format (e.g. lyophilized). Such approaches may be required to help enzyme stability at the challenging environmental conditions of tropical regions. However, enzyme activity loss may be observed in lyophilized compared to liquid reagents. Further problems may arise as NAATs inherently measure both living and dead pathogens (as both can provide template DNA). This may lead to false positive diagnosis, for example during monitoring the progress of a patient over a treatment period. From the infrastructure point of view, specialized laboratory facilities are needed. In this case, well-trained personnel must also be employed to achieve proper assay set-up. In case of multiplexed assays, the risk of human error (e.g. pipetting error) increases, even with experienced personnel. To reach satisfying sensitivity, it is generally still necessary to purify nucleic acids from raw sample materials, such as blood, sputum, or urine. Such purification processes may represent > 50% of the manual workload. The labor costs for manual workflows add substantially to the overall costs.",

The former refers to issues such as portability, modularity, time-to-result, etc. The latter describes the core technical component(s) and main innovative features, e.g. the detection technology, the fluidics handling, and the manufacturing technology. In short: (i) In terms of detection technology, most platforms use optical methods (fluorescence in real-time signal monitoring or imaging mode; or light scattering as in Verigene\u00ae), thus, it appears that progress on the label-free technologies is still required to reach commercial level. Exceptions are the Q-POC\u2122 that uses silicon nanowires for detection and EasyNAT\u2122 that uses an integrated LFT. (ii) Regarding fluidics, it is noteworthy that not all described technologies implement microfluidics but also \"macro\"fluidics. In particular, Enigma\u00ae ML and cobas\u00ae Liat use cartridges that incorporate macrofluidic handling (e.g. syringes, plunges). Fluid handling is mostly pressure-driven, although centrifugal microfluidics are increasingly used (e.g. LabDisk, GenePOC\u2122, Liaison\u00ae MDX). (iii) Manufacturing-wise, the majority of the cartridges are plastic disposables, with some exceptions that are based on CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technologies such as the VerePLEX\u2122 chip and the Q-POC\u2122 silicon nanowire array. (iv) In terms of amplification, all platforms allow for both DNA and RNA analysis. Most of them use RT-PCR although isothermal amplification is also increasingly used (e.g. in Alere\u2122 i, EasyNAT\u2122, LabDisk).

Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that many of the technologies have a sample-to-answer time > 1 h (except Alere\u2122 i, cobas\u00ae Liat, and Q-POC\u2122), while the cost is in the range of tens of US$ for the cartridge and several thousands of US$ for the instrument. Therefore, NAATs seem to be outcompeted by LFTs. However, the added value that multiplex NAAT platforms offer in comparison to the LFTs should be taken into account.

The system contains several additional versions to detect drug-resistant TB, HIV, MRSA, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhea [76] , while it included Ebola testing during the 2014 outbreak. The time-to-result is estimated to be 60 min. The system of the Xpert\u00ae series is developed in single-cartridge or multi-cartridge configurations for the end-users to decide which option is more suitable to their needs: low/medium throughput (1-, 2-, 4-, 16-cartridge system) for the point-of-care, or high throughput (80-cartridge station) for centralized laboratories.

The interface between the valve and the plunger activates the liquids (sample and pre-stored liquid reagents) movement between chambers, by positive or negative pressure through small openings at the base of the reservoirs. An important component of the cartridge is an integrated filter, which is located at the base of the valve body and captures the microorganisms. Subsequently, a sonic horn approaches the filter area and mediates the mechanical lysis of the microorganisms and the release of nucleic acids. The latter are pumped through a chamber where beads with freezedried amplification reagents are stored. These are rehydrated upon sufficient filling of the corresponding chamber (the filling level acts also as internal fluidic quality control). The entire mixture is then directed to the PCR reaction tube, located at the back of the cartridge [79] .",

In contrast to traditional thermal cycling systems, in which all samples are subjected to the same time/temperature/optical protocol, each sample in a GeneXpert\u00ae system can be subjected to a different protocol. One more innovative feature of the processing module is the intelligent cooling/heating optical reaction (I-CORE) module [80] , a sophisticated, solid-state, miniaturized microelectronic and micro-optical system capable of performing PCR reactions with multichannel fluorescence detection in < 30 min. Each I-CORE includes a four-channel optics system capable of exciting and detecting multiple fluorescent dyes in the same reaction tube, thereby being able to accurately measure four DNA targets simultaneously.",

Although the main application of the system has been on respiratory tract infections [105] , its functional and performance characteristics would enable potential use in febrile illness diagnosis. Indicatively, the pipeline of infectious diseases includes influenza A and B, as well as RSV. The Enigma\u00ae ML requires no laptop due to its internal controller and user-friendly touch screen. The instrument is available in a modular configuration, i.e. in a single-module up to a six-module option (for one to six cartridges, respectively). Each module can operate independently via the central controller, therefore, different assays (requiring different protocols) from the same or different specimens can be performed at the same time. The overall analysis time for each module is 95 min. The analytical and diagnostic verification process of the FluAB-RSV assay on the Enigma\u00ae ML that led to the subsequent CE marking was completed in July 2013, at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK [105] .",

Their collaboration with the Institute of Microelectronics (IME) of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore, is strategic for the fabrication of the key microelectronic components. The Q-POC\u2122 platform (Fig. 15 ) of QuantuMDx is a handheld, battery-powered molecular diagnostic device that promises a sample-to-answer DNA-based result in as few as 15 min. It contains integrated reagents with current stability targets of up to 40\u00b0C for up to 18 months. The system can test one patient per run and is a pioneering approach to the handheld sequencing market. In 2014, QuantuMDx partnered with FIND in order to develop a solution for the combined detection of TB and drug susceptibility determination for the causative agent of TB. The Q-POC\u2122 system seems to be especially promising for antimicrobial resistance profiling given that many different genes can be screened through a nanowire array. There are several other assays in the pipeline, for diagnosis of e.g. HIV, sexually transmitted infections, neglected diseases, as well as for tumor profiling [124] .",

SiNWs have large surface-to-volume ratio, tunable electric properties, and exhibit high potential as biosensors, thus enabling next-generation point-of-care diagnostics. The binding events are detected in a labelfree way through changes in the nanowires' resistance, effectively converting the genetic code into a binary code and providing the output in a digitized format. In particular, upon hybridization of the target DNA on the SiNW, the charge density (and subsequently the electric field) changes. This is reflected as a change in the resistance of the nanowire, which produces the biosensing signal (Fig. 16) . The more negative charges present during hybridization, the higher the resistance of the n-type SiNW sensor. This principle was shown by Zhang et al., by varying the hybridization sites (thus varying the distance of the charge layer) but keeping the total number of charges unchanged [126] .",

After amplification is completed, the workflow for detection is as follows: inside the test cartridge, the amplified targets are hybridized to capture oligonucleotides that are pre-immobilized on the glass slide microarray. After removal of the unbound DNA, the hybridization products are labelled with AuNPs. Subsequently, intermediate oligonucleotides are flushed into the chamber and bind specifically to the immobilized complex, leaving a poly-A tail sticking out and being available for subsequent attachment of poly-T-bound AuNPs, which act as probes. After removal of unbound AuNPs, captured AuNPs are covered by silver NPs (during the analysis procedure) to enhance the scattered light. Thus, the overall size of the NPs becomes larger and the subsequent optical signal is enhanced. Illumination begins with an LED (\u03bb max 630 nm) shining through the edge of the glass slide (acting as a waveguide to the LED illumination). The evanescent wave that is generated through the glass slide and towards the NP coated surface causes light scattering from the illuminated Au/silverNPs towards the camera, which captures images of the array multiple times and at various exposure times [144] .

This microfluidic approach benefits in particular from the straightforward mechanism for liquid actuation based on centrifugal forces that are a result of simple rotation of the cartridge with defined spinning frequencies [150] . No external pressure sources or complicated (micro)pumping systems are required, which reduces the risk of cross-contamination (due to openings in the cartridge) and allows for the building of simple, portable processing devices with small footprint and weight. These facts qualify centrifugal microfluidics as a technology for automation of diagnostics at the point of care. A main advantage of centrifugal microfluidics is the employment of microfluidic modules (\"unit operations\"), each one serving a particular fluidic functionality for: liquid handling (e.g. metering and aliquoting [151, 152] , valving and switching [153] [154] [155] , pumping [156, 157] or mixing [158, 159] ); assay integration (reagent pre-storage and supply [160, 161] ); separation [162, 163] ; detection [162, 164] ; blood plasma separation; nucleic acid purification and amplification, or washing and blocking. A comprehensive overview on unit operations and process chains is provided by Strohmeier et al. [165] . Combination of these unit operations and process chains allows for the integration of complex laboratory processes into one system for fully automated sample-to-answer analysis.",

            "text": "Challenges are mainly in the field of cartridge-integrated sample preparation required for completely integrated sample-to-answer solutions [165] [166] [167] . Apart from the world-to-disk interface that defines how the sample can be added by the user to the cartridge, the preparation of complex samples such as sputum, a classical specimen in diagnostics e.g. for detection of tuberculosis [81] , is an unsolved issue yet, as samples can be diverse in their physical constitution, and harsh chemicals or strong forces are required for pretreatment. Further challenges are the handling of increased sample volumes (> 1 mL) of blood or urine that are required when the pathogen load is low or when the required clinical sensitivity for diagnosis is high. The maximum sample volume is typically limited by the available footprint of the disk and it has to be considered that e.g. for nucleic acid extraction by classical bind-wash-elute chemistries, equal volumes of lysis and binding buffer are required for sample treatment, hence posing further challenges to cartridge integrated reagent pre-storage. From the research perspective, increased application of disk-based systems has been recently observed in resource-limited settings, especially in the field of immunodiagnostics. A disk-based test for detection of a four-parameter liver assay panel for defining liver function has been demonstrated to be completed within 20 min by Nwankire et al. [168] using a portable, battery powered processing device and including field testing in a laboratory in Nigeria. Furthermore, Hosseini et al. [169] have implemented a novel mixing method using microspheres on disk in order to detect dengue virus antigen NS1. The following sections provide a short overview of some centrifugal microfluidic platforms that are at late development or market stage. The inclusion criteria in this review were that the technologies focus on infectious diseases and have at least a few publications in the field.",

The technology has been applied in a variety of applications ranging from clinical chemistry [164, 171] , to immunoassay [172] and nucleic acid analysis, indicating universal use. In the latter field, two significant advances in fully automated sample-to-answer (nucleic acid extraction and amplification) analysis were announced, particularly for neonatal sepsis, detecting S. warneri, H. influenza, E. coli, and S. agalactiae [173] , as well as for H3N2 influenza virus [174] . The amplification was based on PCR and the time-to-result was 3-3.5 h. Yet, when the LabDisk was used to integrate RPA isothermal amplification for the detection of biological warfare pathogens (B. anthracis, F. tularensis, and Y. pestis) the total time-toresult was < 45 min [175] . In addition, the processing device for isothermal amplification operates with a power consumption of < 75 W, which facilitates its application in remote environments [176] and its potential use with battery or solar panels. The application of the LabDisk at the point of care in resourcelimited settings has been demonstrated with the detection of Yellow fever virus in laboratory and field settings in Senegal using RPA and 20 min amplification time [177] . Recently, a LabDisk was developed for the detection of malaria, dengue, chikungunya, pneumonia, and typhoid fever that used LAMP providing the necessary means for nucleic acid based multiplex amplification with a time-to-result between 70 and 120 min [178] . Currently, one disadvantage of LabDisk is that, while several parameters can be analyzed per disk, only one disk, corresponding to one patient, can be processed per test run.",

Typical foil thicknesses are between 150 and 300 \u03bcm. A mold and a thin polymer foil placed above the mold are heated at a temperature near the glass transition temperature of the polymer foil. When the conditions are favorable, air is blown from the top so that the foil takes the shape of the mold. Main process parameters are the applied air pressure and the temperatures of mold and foil. Various materials can be used, with most preferable candidates being the Cyclic Olefin Polymer/Copolymer (COP, COC) and Polycarbonate (PC), depending on the application requirements. Sealing is performed either via a pressure sensitive adhesive foil (containing nanocapsules, which break and release adhesive upon application of pressure) or via thermal sealing using one more foil material (e.g. COC on COC). The elastomeric molds are suitable for prototyping, where fast iterations are required. However, each elastomeric mold may be worn out after repeated use for some tens of cartridges. Thus, for large manufacturing series it is more efficient to use a metal mold. It may be more challenging to deform the foil (and methods such as coating on metal are used), however it is economically more sustainable and the durability of one metal mold can be sufficient for tens of thousands of disks.",

The developers mention that the use of blood is not feasible yet, as it would require off-chip microbial preconcentration. Subsequently, the inlet chamber is sealed with a lid that prevents aerosols from leakage. A series of siphons and passive valves prime the liquid to the next chambers. (ii) Universal sample preparation, starting with pathogen mechanical lysis: a metallic disk is magnetically actuated in the chamber where glass beads are present leading to efficient lysis and release of nucleic acids. The lysate is centrifugally driven to a dilution chamber, where PCR inhibitors are inactivated by heating up to 95\u00b0C and with proper ionic condition adjustment of the extracted material in order to optimize subsequent amplification. (iii) The amplification and detection sector, which is the only assay-specific area of the cartridge where RT-PCR is performed (reagents are drystored). This sector has three chambers available for amplification (thermocycling is achieved via air heating of the overall process chamber). The device includes four non-overlapping excitation and emission wavelengths for fluorescence detection of chemical dyes, therefore, up to 12 targets (4 in each chamber) can be detected simultaneously, and under rotation.

The target patient populations are children presenting with severe illness, those with risk factors for bloodstream infections, such as neonates, malnourished or HIV positive children, those who fail to respond to first-line antibiotic treatment, hospitalized war patients, and patients with trauma or prior surgery by providing organism-directed antibiotic therapy. With the developed autonomous diagnostic laboratory, it will be possible to acquire information regarding more general questions such as proportions and antibiotic resistance profiles of key bacterial pathogens, thereby providing evidence-based information for antibiotic policy (appropriate prescribing) and allowing for the improvement of epidemiological investigations as well as supporting healthcare infection control in emergencies and in neglected populations in resource-limited settings.",

This should be a requirement for all new diagnostic tests, but it is even more important for point-of-care tests that are often used in nonselected patients (for example, any patient with fever attending any level of the health system) and by users with no technical background. Before large-scale implementation in resource-limited countries is decided, the test should also preferably be endorsed by WHO and by international donors and governments that provide funding. Unfortunately, many point-of-care tests have been launched in the market with only limited laboratory validation using convenient patient samples (for example that have a high pathogen load), or even cultured pathogens in relatively high concentration. Field evaluation of the performance of the test in real patients, who often harbor low pathogen loads, is indeed often undertaken only after registration of the product. This is due to the lack of national and international regulatory mechanisms applicable to diagnostic tests, which, in contrast, exist for medicines [189] . The net result is that health workers, especially those working in private clinics, and even patients going to pharmacies, have access to POC tests that have in fact very low sensitivity and/or specificity.

Tests based on the detection of antibodies, even of IgM type, often lack sensitivity during the very first days of an acute febrile episode, but also specificity because of antibody persistence for several weeks. These challenges show how important it is to undertake clinical trials in real conditions to assess first the real performance of the test in the field (accuracy against the best available standard), and then the impact of using such tests on the management of patients (efficacy, measured through the impact on the health outcome of patients, cure rate after a certain number of days, secondary hospitalizations, or deaths and sequelae), done by routine health staff in their real working environment (effectiveness, measured generally through the level of compliance to test results and guidelines, and the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescriptions) (Fig. 29 ). Outcomes measured in these trials should be related to the health outcome of patients and the public health benefits, and not only to the diagnosis based on laboratory reference standards (which for some diseases are anyway suboptimal or even non-existent).",

To follow this adage, it is even more important nowadays that a continually increasing number of diagnostic tools is becoming available at the point of care. That should, however, not be interpreted as it has been for years with malaria microscopy, as an invitation to disregard test results and treat diseases presumptively based on clinical elements with low sensitivity and/or specificity [195] . This adage rather suggests that, because no diagnostic test is 100% perfect, their results do not provide a black-orwhite answer, but rather an indication on the disease probability. This probability depends on two factors: (i) the prevalence of the disease in the corresponding patient population (pre-test probability), and (ii) the performance (positive and negative likelihood ratios) of the test used. When a disease is rare in the population (low pre-test probability) even if the test has a reasonable accuracy, the post-test probability after a positive result remains low. For example, if a typhoid rapid test with 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity (and thus, a likelihood ratio (LR) of 0.8/(1-0.8) = 4) is used in an area of Asia where prevalence of typhoid fever among patients with febrile illness is 20%, the post-test probability will be 50% (it can be calculated using Fagan's nomogram [196] ), which suggests that it is reasonable to implement an antibiotic treatment to that patient. If the same test is used in an area of Africa where the prevalence is 2%, the post-test probability will only be 7.5%, which hardly justifies treating the patient for typhoid but rather to consider alternative diagnoses.",

An electronic algorithm is, indeed, able to guide clinicians through the specific branches that apply to their patients, to accelerate training by teaching health workers directly on the mobile support (and even integrating training modules into the device), and to help to disseminate quickly to all health workers updated versions of e-algorithms through 3G connection. Fig. 30 provides a schematic representation of an integrated tool that aims at managing children with febrile disease at primary care level in resource-limited countries (derived from the existing e-POCT tool [23] ). The tool integrates a few key clinical data, biosensors measuring respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, cardiac rate, glycemia, and hemoglobinemia, as well as rapid diagnostic tests detecting malaria antigen (other pathogens can be added according to local endemicities) and host biomarkers (to differentiate bacterial from viral infections).

The source of information would be patients seen at routine health facilities tested by POC tools that have a direct impact on case management (e.g. malaria or typhoid), but also from a restricted number of sentinel sites where additional POC test, aimed at detecting pathogens of particular interest (that cause large epidemics, even if non-treatable such as dengue, or rare such as Ebola virus disease), would be used. The data accumulated on a daily or weekly basis (depending on the level of 3G connection availability) at the central level would allow health authorities to conduct real-time disease surveillance, through weekly/monthly reports, and would also enable immediate outbreak alarms when the preset incidence threshold for the surveyed disease has been reached. From the central server, automated feedback reports can also be created, sent to clinicians' tablets and discussed during supervision visits at the health facility. Training e-tools, aimed at improving management of patients in general or in the particular situation of an outbreak, could also be sent to the tablet to guide clinicians. Finally, a patient file supported by an electronic card owned by the patient, could be synchronized at each new consultation with the data collected by clinicians in the tablet (Fig. 31) . Such a fully integrated system seems to be overoptimistic; however, each of its components has already proven to be feasible and the challenge now is to find appropriate and sustainable diagnostic and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) platforms that can be deployed at large scale and in the long term.",

Regarding performance, some technologies may be fully automated and multiplexed, but they are prohibitively expensive; some are cost-effective, but compromise sensitivity or multiplexity. In contrast, some solutions offer multiplexity, yet they are benchtop, require laptop, electricity, and are barely portable (due to size and weight). Regarding technology, most of the described platforms implement nucleic acid amplification (PCR-or isothermal-based) and almost none of them includes a parallel immunoassay analysis to measure the host response to an infection. A few of the suggested approaches are equipment-free but therefore lack connectivity and interfacing ability. However, one can observe a common rationale in the structure of the described technologies. The vast majority are based on the combination of three components: the assay, the cartridge, and the readout device. Several variations may exist in the format of the assay, the cartridge, or the detection principle; however, this three-element model seems to be the backbone of all described diagnostic platforms. This modular nature should motivate the developers and manufacturers to consider more (semi)open and adaptable platforms to address end-users' needs in a dynamic way, being able to quickly modify their panels and adapt to endemic or epidemic needs.",

Such algorithms are derived from paper-based guidelines to computerized versions (which enforce the provision of output for any possible combination of clinical elements, which is not the case for traditional guidelines), operating on 3G mobile tools such as tablets. They receive, as input, data from several (POC and non-POC) diagnostic tests, which are processed via clinical algorithms, to provide clinicians with guidance regarding the handling of the patient (admission, treatment, etc.). Such interoperability between ICT components and interfaced physical systems (diagnostic tests) for decision-support can provide solutions of clinical and public health utility, therefore, this trend is expected to increase rapidly, offering high impact diagnosis in developing countries, and transforming the global healthcare landscape. This process, being rather complex and requiring know-how from a variety of disciplines and partners, requires multiple interactions between universities, industries, governmental and non-governmental organizations, as well as philanthropic institutions, that are not only based in wealthy countries but also in resource-limited countries.

Further elaborating on the ecosystem approach, and especially for diagnostics for resource-limited countries, special business model developments are required that would render marketization in the target areas attractive. Large industries or Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) may choose their own way to market, but a new path may be to try marketing in partnership with the pharmaceutical industry.
