They infect the respiratory or gastrointestinal system, or both. 41 FIP coronavirus, feline enteric coronavirus, canine coronavirus (CCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, and human respiratory tract coronavirus comprise an antigenic cluster of closely related viruses within the family Coronaviridae. 34 The major structural proteins of these coronaviruses are antigenically similar to the extent that most investigators consider these coronaviruses as host-range variants rather than individual corona virus species. 5 Strains of feline coronavirus that infect cats have been divided into those that cause FIP and those that induce subclinical to severe enteritis (Table 1) . 30 Strains of FIP coronavirus differ from those of feline enteric coronavirus in that FIP coronavirus is able to escape from the gastrointestinal tract and spread to replication sites in other organs. Strains of FIP coronavirus and feline enteric coronavirus probably represent pathogenic variants of a single coronavirus type.' Alternatively, strains of FIP coronavirus may arise as mutants of feline enteric coronavirus strains. 33 Current knowledge of the cell culture-adapted strains of feline coronavirus is based on their morphologic, structural, and antigenic relationship to TGEV and CCV; the nature of the disease caused in the host; growth characteristics in cell culture systems; and the degree of relatedness to CCV in virus neutralization tests. 30 ",

Strains of low virulence, such as FIPV-UCD2 and FIPV-UCD3, can become established as asymptomatic infections; fatal FIP disease occurs only if the immunologic responsiveness of the host later becomes compromised. 33 Most cases of FIP disease result from infection with strains similar to FIPV-TN406 and not with those strains of FIP coronavirus that are closely related to CCV. 33 Most asymptomatic cats with positive coronavirus-antibody titers have been previously infected by strains of feline enteric coronavirus or FIP coronavirus, which usually do not cause fatal disease by natural routes of infection. Asymptomatic cats, however, may later succumb if exposed to a more virulent strain of FIP coronavirus. Coronavirus antibody-positive cats that resist later challenge probably seroconvert as a result of a systemic infection with a virulent strain of FIP corona virus. 25 Various strains of FIP coronavirus evidently survive in the environment much longer than originally was believed. In recent studies/ 6 FIP coronavirus was recovered from contaminated dry surfaces for 3 to 7 weeks. The amount of infectious virus recovered decreases with time. Because relatively large quantities of FIP coronavirus are required to establish natural infection in a susceptible cat, strains of coronavirus probably are not contagious to cats for longer than 2 or 3 weeks after an environment, bedding, food bowl, or water bowl is contaminated. 36 Infectivity of feline coronavirus strains is destroyed by most household disinfectants and detergents. 11",

            "text": "After natural infection, localization and replication of FIP coronavirus occur in large mononuclear cells of regional lymphoid tissue at or near the site of initial virus penetration (Fig. 1 ). 43 \u2022 44 A primary viremia results with free virus and virus-infected mononuclear cells being transported to other body organs, especially to the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. These organs are subsequently involved because they contain large populations of macrophages, which are the principal target cells for FIP corona virus infection. 43 A secondary macrophage-associated viremia then occurs, resulting in further spread of FIP coronavirus throughout the body! The susceptibility of cats to FIP disease may involve several predisposing factors, including age at time of exposure, genetic susceptibility, physical condition, stress, presence of concurrent disease (especially feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus infections), challenge dose and strain of feline coronavirus, route of infection, previous sensitization with nonprotective corona virus antibodies, and cell-mediated immunocompetence. 2 \u2022 4 If an effective cell-mediated immune response is exhibited during the primary phase of coronavirus infection, viremia will probably be terminated, thereby protecting the cat against FIP disease. 28 Most cats subsequently do not show clinical evidence of FIP coronavirus infection. Some cats, however, may develop a transient fever that lasts for 1 to 5 days and mild mesenteric Iymphadenopathy. 30 If the infected cat is unable to mount an effective cellmediated immune response and produces coronavirus antibodies that do not neutralize the virus, infection progresses rapidly into a fulminating form of FIP disease. A similar situation may occur if the cat has already acquired coronavirus antibodies through previous infection with a strain of feline enteric coronavirus or FIP coronavirus of low virulence. 6 In the absence of an effective cell-mediated immune response, a strong nonprotective humoral response may result in effusive form of FIP disease. Cats that exhibit a partial cell-mediated immune response may develop noneffusive FIP disease. u An effective cell-mediated immune response does not always eliminate FIP coronavirus from the body. In some recovered cats, the infection may persist in various places in the body, such as the gastrointestinal tract or associated lymph nodes. 30 Factors that depress cell-mediated immune responsiveness, such as feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus infections, concurrent disease, and advanced age, may allow recrudescence of macrophageassociated infection with periodic shedding of FIP corona virus, thereby resulting in effusive or noneffusive disease. 2 \u2022 4 An exaggerated and nonprotective humoral response results in excessive levels of coronavirus antibodies and the formation of large immune complexes that are rapidly phagocytized by reticuloendothelial cells. 44 Immune complexes deposited in small blood vessels fix and activate complement, thereby resulting in the release of the third component of complement. Phagocytosis of aggregates containing coronavirus, immunoglobulin, and complement is aided by the presence of receptors for immunoglobulin and complement on the macrophage surface. 43 Macrophages that are in perivascular locations ingest aggregates of intact FIP coronavirus, immunoglobulin, and complement and thus encourage replication of the virus and the release of new virus and complement components. 20 Uptake and processing of FIP coronavirus in these macrophages may be enhanced by an impaired cell-mediated immune response. 5 Recurrent complement-mediated damage results in the release of chemotactic complement components and the attraction of neutrophils. Release of proteolytic enzymes from degenerated neutrophils exacerbates tissue damage. 5 In cases of FIP disease, degenerative and proliferative changes occur in blood vessels, particularly in the endothelial and medial layers of small veins and arteries in the peritoneal serosa and in the interstitial connective tissue of parenchymatous organs. 18 The vascular lesion results in a pyogranulomatous lesion. 5 In effusive disease, complement-mediated damage to the vascular endothelium results in increased vascular permeability and leakage of a nonseptic exudate rich in fibrin and immunoglobulin. 5 Severe damage to the vascular endothelium also contributes to disseminated intravascular coagulation. The development of multiple clotting abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, increased quantity of fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products, and decreased activity of clotting factors VII, VIII, IX, XI, and XII, is evident in fatal cases of FIP disease. 42 Although most cats undergoing the primary phase of FIP coronavirus infection recover, many cats remain persistently infected, that is, they are persistent carriers of FIP corona virus. A small number of these cats subsequently develop the fatal FIP disease weeks to months after the primary phase of infection. 36",

Excluding cats in catteries and in multiple-cat households, 10% to 40% of cats in the general feline population have coronavirus antibodies in their serum. If cats are housed together, the rate of seropositivity is completely absent or present in 80% to 90% of the cats, depending on whether feline corona virus is enzootic in that cat population. 5 There are several situations in which assay results for the detection of coronavirus antibody are potentially helpful to the clinician and the cat owner. Serotesting for feline coronavirus may be used as a screening procedure to determine if coronavirus is enzootic in a cat population and as an adjunct in the diagnosis of PIP disease. 5 Most cats with histopathologically confirmed PIP disease have high coronavirus-antibody titers. 5 Titers greater than 1:3200 usually are associated with noneffusive disease, whereas titers of 1:100 to 1:3200 may be found in cats with effusive and noneffusive disease and in cats with feline enteric coronavirus infection. 25 In some cats with PIP disease, negative titers or a decrease in titers may be seen terminally; this is a grave prognostic sign. In addition to correlating the positive coronavirus-antibody titer with other diagnostic information on the patient, the clinician should be aware that differences in assay results can be found between diagnostic laboratories and in the clinician's own interpretation of assay results. 2 A few cats with histopathologically confirmed PIP disease may have negative coronavirus-antibody titers. 5 Reasons for negative titers include disappearance of coronavirus antibodies in the terminal stages of PIP disease, formation of immune complexes that leave little if any free coronavirus antibodies to react in the assay procedure, use of assay systems that are not sensitive enough to detect low levels of coronavirus antibodies, and presence of small amounts of coronavirus antibodies in fulminating cases of effusive diseaseY",

Because of this potential interference, it is recommended that elective serotesting of healthy cats for evidence of exposure to feline coronavirus should be delayed until at least 3 to 4 months after the last parenteral vaccine was given. 5 At the time of this writing, available serologic assays for detecting coronavirus antibodies do not identify the strain of coronavirus that is responsible for the eat's seroconversion; also, the presence of coronavirus-antibody titers merely indicates that the cat has been infected with a coronavirus in the coronavirus antigenic cluster. 5 \u2022 36 Most healthy cats with positive coronavirusantibody titers have probably been infected with strains of feline enteric coronavirus, with non-FIP disease-producing strains of FIP coronavirus, or with FIP disease-producing strains. Most healthy coronavirus antibody-positive cats are probably not immune carriers of highly virulent FIP coronavirus. 33 It is impossible to predict accurately the long-term prognosis of healthy coronavirus antibody-positive cat. Positive antibody titers do not indicate that a cat is protected against future development of FIP disease, will later develop FIP disease, or is definitely a hazard to other cats. 2 ",

The original wild-type strain of FIP coronavirus, known as FIPV-DF2 isolate, is attenuated by 99 passages in Norden Laboratories feline kidney (NLFK) cell line, of which passages 61 to 99 are propagated at 31\u00b0C.
