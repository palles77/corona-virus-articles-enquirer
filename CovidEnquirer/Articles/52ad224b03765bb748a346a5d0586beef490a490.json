The effects of 03 exposure on the response to antigenic stimulation also depend on the time at which 03 exposure occurred. Whereas 03 exposure prior to immunization is without effect on the response to antigen, 03 exposure subsequent to immunization suppresses the response to antigen. Although most studies have focused on immune responses in the lung, numerous investigators have provided functional and anatomical evidence to support the hypothesis that 03 exposure can have profound effects on systemic immunity. -Environ Health Perspect 1 03(Suppl 2): 77-89 (1995) ",

The immune response is mediated by a variety of soluble factors and cells grouped according to their capacity to mediate innate (natural) or adaptive (acquired) immune responses. Innate immunity is primarily dependent on the phagocytic effector mechanisms (induding humoral factors such as complement, lysozyme, etc.), which are neither specific for particular infectious agents nor improved by repeated encounters with the same agent. Acquired immunity is specific for the inducing agent and is marked by an enhanced response upon repeated encounters with that agent, thus displaying memory. These systems do not function independently since innate and acquired immune mechanisms can interact; specific antibodies enhance the phagocytic ingestion process and cell-mediated immune responses increase the intracellular microbicidal and tumoricidal capabilities of the phagocytes. Both innate and acquired immune responses and the cells that carry out these processes are regulated by soluble factors such as cytokines and various autocoids.",

A number of studies have investigated the effect of 0 exposure on the blastogenic response of lymphocytes to nonspecific mitogens. These assays measure nonspecific clonal expansion of the lymphocyte populations, a critical step during the amplification of the immune response. Thus, MLN cells stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) during the course of continuous 0.7 ppm 03 exposure (20 hr/day, 7 days/week for 28 consecutive days) showed little change in responsiveness during the first week; however, by day 14, an enhanced reactivity was observed that continued to increase through day 28 (4, 8) . Short-term exposure studies have shown that the rat splenic cell responses to T-cell mitogens phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and ConA and a B-cell mitogen (Escherichia coli LPS) were significantly enhanced by exposure to 1 ppm 03 (8 hr/day for 7 days) (14) . In contrast, intermittent exposure to 2 ppm 03 (8 hr/day for 4 days, 2-4 days in ambient air followed by another day of 03 exposure) was without effect while long-term exposure of mice to 0.1 ppm 03 (5 hr/day, 5 days/week for 103 days) suppressed the splenic cell responses to T-cell mitogens (PHA and ConA) but not to a B-cell mitogen [Salmonella typhosa LPS; (15) ].",

To investigate the effects of acute and chronic exposure to 03 at near ambient concentrations, Selgrade et al. (18) used an experimental protocol designed to mimic diurnal urban 03 exposure patterns. Rats were exposed to a background level of 0.06 ppm for a period of 13 hr, a broad exposure spike rising from 0.06 ppm to 0.25 ppm and returning to 0.06 ppm over 9 hr, and a 2-hr downtime. The exposures to this profile were 5 days/week; weekend exposures were to the background. After 1, 3, 13, 52, or 78 weeks of exposure, blood was drawn and the spleens removed. Spleen cells were assessed for NK cell activity and responses to T-cell mitogens (P1A and ConA) and a B-cell mitogen (Salmonella typhimurium glycoprotein). Peripheral blood leukocytes were also assessed for responses to T-cell mitogens. The data show that 03 exposure had no effect on NK cell activity, nor were there any 03-related changes in mitogen responses in splenic or blood leukocytes. There were also no effects of a single 3-hr exposure to 1 ppm of 03 on spleen cell responses to the mitogens immediately after exposure or at 24, 48, and 72 hr thereafter.",

Exposure of subjects to 0.4 ppm 03 for 4 hr impaired the ability of B-cells to form rosettes with human erythrocytes, whereas the ability of T-cells to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes was unaffected (19) . Another study examined the effects of a single 2-hr exposure to 0.6 ppm 03 on the mitogenic response of peripheral lymphocytes following stimulation with PHA, ConA, pokeweed mitogen (PWM), and Candida albicans. The mitogenic response to PHA was significantly reduced at 2 and 4 weeks following 03 exposure, with normal responses observed at 2 months. In contrast, no significant changes in lymphocyte responses to ConA, PWM, and C albicans were observed (20) . Finally, subjects were exposed for 2 hr to 0.12 and 0.4 ppm 03 during moderate exercise, and PHA-induced peripheral T-cell proliferation was assessed before exposure and 24 and 72 hr after exposure (21) . In the absence of 03, exercise enhanced proliferation as compared Environmental Health Perspectives to resting subjects, whereas exposure to 0 with exercise appeared to reduce the capacity of the subjects to react to exercise with an enhanced proliferative response. This reduced response appeared to be more pronounced in subjects exposed to the higher concentration of 03 and appeared to be more pronounced at 24 hr than 72 hr postexposure.",

In the first study, mice were continuously exposed to 0.8 ppm 0 for 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. After each day of exposure, the animals were tested for the primary splenic antibody response to either sheep erythrocytes (SRBCs; T-dependent antigen) or DNP-Ficoll (T-independent antigen). The antibody response to SRBCs was suppressed following all exposure periods. In contrast, no suppression was observed in the primary antibody response to DNP-Ficoll (3). When the continuous 0.8 ppm 03 exposure was extended to 56 days, suppression of the primary splenic antibody response to SRBCs, but not DNP-Ficoll, was still evident (11) . Using the same exposure protocol (continuous 0.8 ppm 03 for 1, 3, 7, and 14 days), the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to SRBCs was also examined (28) . Ozone exposure gradually depressed the DTH reaction from 1 day to 7 days of exposure and returned to control levels by day 14. In the same study, the timing between 03 exposure and SRBC immunization for the DTH response was also examined. Continuous exposure to 0.8 ppm 03 for 3 days immediately before immunization (with no post-immunization exposure) had no effect on the DTH reaction, whereas continuous 0.8 ppm 03 exposure for 3 days following immunization significantly suppressed the DTH response (28) . In toto, it appears that 03 exposure preferentially affects the immune repertoire of the T-cells rather than that of the B-cells.",

Many studies on the effects of 0 on host defenses have been performed wit; a rodent model that is often referred to as the \"infectivity model\" (39) . In this model, rodents are Volume 103, Supplement 2, March 1995 challenged by aerosol inhalation with highly virulent Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes following various 03 exposure protocols and observed for deaths over the subsequent 14-day period. The data on the effects of 03 exposure are expressed as increases in mortality. The earliest of these studies (40) found significant increases in mortality following K pneumoniae challenge when mice were exposed to 1 ppm and 4 ppmO3 for 3 hr, 1 ppm O3 for 100 hr, and 1 ppm 03 for 4 hr/day, 5 days/week for 2 weeks. With the use of Streptococcus pyogenes, the sensitivity of the \"infectivity model\" increased in that significant differences in mortality were demonstrated when the infectious challenge was given simultaneously or 2 hr after exposure to 0.1 ppm 0 for 3 hr (41). Mice exposed 5 hr/day, 5 Lays/week for 103 days to 0.1 ppm 0 also exhibited increased susceptibility to death from streptococcus challenges (15) . Other studies with the \"infectivity model\" involving 03 exposure focused on the relationship between 03 and NO2 exposure on resistance to streptococcal pneumonia (42) (43) (44) . The \"infectivity model\" links interference with pulmonary antibacterial defenses to mortality following pulmonary challenges with virulent organisms. Another approach is to use minimally virulent organisms, such as S. aureus, that do not provoke injurious responses in the lungs (45). In this system, rodents are challenged by aerosol inhalation with staphylococci and intrapulmonary killing of the organism is assessed over a 4or 5-hr period by standard microbiologic methods. Exposure to O can occur before, after, or before and after bacterial challenge. Under normal conditions, approximately 90% of the staphylococci are killed over the initial 4-hr period of infection. The effects of 03 exposure are assessed in terms of suppression of intrapulmonary bacterial killing.",

Then, to test the functional activity of these two cell populations, the proliferative response of MLN and splenic lymphocytes to PHA stimulation was measured (68) . The data ( Figure 2A ) demonstrate that continuous 0 exposure causes a reversible decline in M3LN cells followed by hypertrophy. Spleen weights were decreased with respect to body weight after 1 day of 03 exposure ( Figure 2B ). This effect was still evident at day 3 but returned to control values following 7 days of exposure. With continuous exposure, the spleens were larger in size relative to body weight than in control animals. Cells from both MLN and splenic sources obtained after 1 day of 03 exposure had reduced responsiveness to PHA mitogen ( Figure 3A ). However, this effect was ablated following prolonged exposure. In a similar manner, the NK cell activity of splenic lymphocytes was significantly reduced following 1 and 3 days exposure but was restored upon continued exposure ( Figure 3B ).",

One week after the aerosol boost (i.e., 3 weeks after the intraperitoneal priming injection), the MLN and splenic lymphocytes were assayed for proliferative responses to OA antigen, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was assayed for specific IgG and IgA antibody to OA. Ozone exposure was incorporated into this immunization protocol to the effect that groups of animals were exposed to 0.8 ppm of 0 for 23 hr/day for 1, 3, 7, or 14 days prior to assay as shown schematically in Table 1 . Figure 4A shows that the MLN cell responses to OA antigen were not significantly different from controls for 1, 3, and 7 days of 0 exposure. However, following 14 days of exposure to 03 the MLN lymphocyte responses to OA antigen were significantly enhanced. Splenocyte responses to OA antigen were similarly unaffected by 1 and 3 days of exposure, but were significantly lower than control values at the 7-and 14-day time points.",

            "text": "During the course of studies on the effect of continuous 0.5 ppm 0 exposure on AM Fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis, it was also observed that the exposure impaired peritoneal macrophage (PM) phagocytosis. Due to its high reactivity, it seemed unlikely that 03 could directly mediate systemic changes in phagocyte function. Rather, as has been suggested by others, the systemic effects of oxidant gases are likely indirect, due to mediators produced upon oxidant exposure (69) . One such class of mediators may be the prostaglandins, potent immunomodulatory autacoids found in high concentrations in the airways (70, 71) and serum of animals (72) and man (73) following acute 0 exposure. Furthermore, exogenously added prostaglandin E (PGE) inhibits macrophage phagocytosis (p4). To test the hypothesis that PGE plays a role in mediating the 03-induced suppression of macrophage phagocytosis, mice were continuously exposed to 0.5 ppm 0 and the effect of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin on AM and PM Fc-receptormediated phagocytosis and PGE levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) were assessed. Figure 5A shows that the time course for 0 -induced impairment of PM phagocyto- .3 sis paralleled that of the AMs in that maximal suppression occurred at 3 days of exposure, which progressively abated as exposure continued. PGE levels in BAL fluid during the course of 03 exposure are presented in Figure 5B . indomethacin for 3 days before and during 03 exposure ablated the 03-induced increases in bronchoalveolar savage PGE levels ( Figure 6 ) and suppression of PM phagocytosis (Figure 7) . Indomethacin also significantly reduced the effect on AM phagocytosis on the third day of exposure (Figure 7) . The effect of indomethacin on 03-induced suppression of PM phagocytosis were mimicked by pretreatment of mice with the active enantiomer of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor naproxen (74) . Thus, prostanoids seem to play a key role in the local and systemic decreases in phagocytic activity induced by 03. The observations that prostanoids play a significant role in the suppression of AM phagocytic function has been recently confirmed with S. zooepidemicus as shown by the reduced susceptibility of mice to 0 3-enhanced infection by indomethacin treatment (50) . Reduction ofInfluenzaVi rus Pathogenesis Although 03 exposure has been shown to increase susceptibility to infectious bacterial challenges, the opposite has been observed with viral infections; ozone exposure actually diminishes the severity of influenza virus infection, as evidenced by decreased mortality and increased survival time (56) .",

            "text": "Before reaching any conclusions on the effects of in vivo exposure to 03 on the immune system, several related issues warrant discussion. These issues broadly encompass inhalation toxicology, immunotoxicology, host factors, and experimental design. Figure 8 . Morphometric analysis of lung tissue (A), lung wet/dry weight ratios and lung lavage albumin content (B) among virus-infected and -uninfected mice that were continuously exposed to 0.5 ppm ozone or allowed to breathe ambient air for 9 days. * = p< 0.05, virus-infected versus virus-infected and ozoneexposed. From Jakab et al. (85) . Concepts of inhalation toxicology dictate that the animals exposed to 03 and unexposed animals are treated in an identical manner (i.e., the control animals are exposed to filtered air in an identical exposure chamber so that the only difference between the experimental and control group is the 0 exposure). Assuming that this practice is fog lowed, several issues arise with the longer term continuous 03 exposure studies that may influence the outcome of an immunologic parameter under investigation. For example, continuous 03 exposure leads to a loss of appetite in rodents as reflected by a slower weight gain in young animals (92) and, depending on the 0 concentrations, weight loss in older mice (6J Jakab, unpublished observations). Malnutrition is known to affect the integrity of the immune system (93) and, to a lesser extent, undernutrition also blunts the immune response (94) . In addition to 03 exposure retarding growth due to loss of appetite, the food consumed by control and exposed animals is not the same. Ozone exposure oxidizes the food thereby altering its nutritional value (95) . Variations in diet composition are known to affect the immune response (93, 94, 96) . Because of this, animals exposed to 0 for longer periods of time have a nutritional? disadvantage that may act in concert with 03 exposure to suppress immunity. During long-term continuous 03 exposure, little can be done about the loss of appetite except to match the food intake of the control animals to that of the exposed animals. To minimize the effects of ingesting 0 -oxidized food, it may be prudent to provide 0 3-treated food for the control animals (85, 86) . In addition to the nutritional aspect, the health status of the experimental animals also merits consideration. Animal husbandry has greatly improved over the past few decades to the point that reputable suppliers are capable of providing animals for research purposes that are free of intercurrent diseases. However, endogenous infections of rodents are pervasive (97) , and assessment of the health status of the animals requires constant vigilance by suppliers and in the research setting since intercurrent infections are known to have profound effects on toxicity and research testing (98, 99) . For example, one of the most common infections of rodent colonies is Sendai (parainfluenza 1) virus (100) . Sendai virus infection suppresses AM phagocytosis (101, 102) and the primary antibody response of splenocytes to SRBCs (103) reduces T-cell mitogenesis (104, 105) , increases splenic NK cell activity (106, 107) , alters the in vitro response to heterologous erythrocytes (108) , and alters immune cell function in aging mice (109) . Other endogenous rodent infectious agents of concern to toxicologists include pneumonia virus of mice, mouse hepatitis virus, rat coronavirus, minute virus of mice, Kilham rat virus, Tooland's virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis (98, 110) . Because of the possibility that intercurrent infections confound studies, the validity of observed results may be at risk if the health status of animals is not defined. rat AMs seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (35) ; and d) visual counting of Fc-receptormediated ingestion by adherent rat AMs (33) and mouse AMs (67, 74) . With the use of the 3.5 pm carbon-coated latex particles, it was observed that continuous exposure to 0.8 ppm 0 for 3 days enhanced Sprague-Dawley rat AM phagocytosis (32) . In contrast, the opposite was observed when the challenge particles were sensitized SRBCs in that continuous 0.5 ppm 03 exposure suppressed Wistar rat AM phagocytosis (33) . These data point to vast differences in sensitivities to 03 exposure between the two assay systems, the response between the two strains of rats, or the 0.3 ppm difference in the 03 exposure concentration. In a manner similar to that exemplified with the effects of 03 exposure on AM phagocytosis, questions arise about the relative sensitivities of the assays that measure lymphocyte function. Uptake of radiolabeled thymidine following stimulation with lectins or microbial products is a common method for assessing the ability ofTand Bcells to proliferates; a step required for the amplification of the immune response. These mitogens have specific binding sites which may not be present on all cell types (111) . For example, PHA binds to the Tcell receptor and CD2 antigens of most Tcells (111) . Concanavlin A binds to all Tcells (CD3) and is more potent than PHA (112) , while differences in the binding sites of PWM may exist between different species of animals. Although the binding of these mitogens to specific glycoproteins on the cell surface are integral to subsequent proliferation, these binding sites are many and varied on any given cell population. Thus, depending upon the mitogen employed and the species from which the cells are derived, immune defects in any population of cells may be exaggerated or underestimated during a proliferative event.",

Often the generation of antibody against Tcell-dependent antigens (e.g., SRBCs) are compared to antibody production against T-cell-independent antigens (e.g., DNP-Ficoll) as indicators of T-and B-cell competence respectively. Even though these regimens are optimized to provide maximal immune stimulation, the relative immunogenicity of the test antigens and the avidity and specificity of the antibodies generated may differ between assay systems. Thus, problems of antigen potency and antibody specificity may arise not only in the immunization stages in vivo but also in the detection ofantibody during immunoassay.",

For example, the observation of decreased lymphocyte sensitivity to antigen in the spleen following prolonged 03 exposure and a contrasting increase in MLN lymphocyte activity ( Figure 4A ) could be explained by local inflammation and cellular recruitment to the site of oxidant damage (i.e., a simple matter of immune circulation).

While the wide diversity of receptor sites on antibody and T-cell receptors occur by gene rearrangement of the immunoglobulin superfamily, a more innate and stable genetic influence exists over host susceptibility in mice to intracellular infections such as Listeria, Mycobacteria, and Salmonellae spp. (135) . In many cases, the host response, which governs protection from these organisms, is the DTH reaction, involving both T-cells and subsequent activation of macrophages. Genetic differences have also been recently observed in the ability of two different strains of mice to resist streptococcal challenge (50) . It is also becoming dear that some mouse strains produce high or low titers of circulating antibody following identical immunization procedures (136) . Thus, in addition to species differences, strain differences may also play a role in the immunotoxicology of 0; at this time, it is not known to what extent tie combination of variables that include age, animal species, and genetic constitution may influence the effect of 03 exposure on immune responsiveness.",

In the first (Figure 1 1A) , an initial suppression followed by recovery has been observed with spleen weights (3) , spleen/body weight ratios (68), thymus weight (4), AM phagocytosis (33, 34, 67, 74) , PM phagocytosis (74), pulmonary NK and splenic NK cell activity (16, 68) , MLN proliferative response (68) , and AM-dependent intrapulmonary bacterial killing (67) . The second response pattern (Figure 11 B) , an initial suppression followed by an increased (4, 68) . The third response pattern (Figure 11 C), an initial absence of a response followed by increased activity, has been observed with MLN (8) and splenic (14) proliferative responses. Finally, in Figure 1 ID, a sustained response of thymic atrophy has also been observed (11) . The second exposure protocol consists of short (hourly) 03 exposures with the tests performed immediately after exposure or at various times thereafter. The data show that immediately after exposure, AM phagocytosis is suppressed (30, 31, 34) and then followed by reestablishment of phagocytosis as the interval between exposure and assay was lengthened. The third exposure protocol consists of continuous 0 exposure for several days (or weeks) followed by tests immediately after exposure or at various intervals thereafter. Using this exposure protocol, T/Blymphocyte ratios remained elevated for at least 5 days after exposure (10) . Perhaps more studies were not performed with this 03 exposure protocol because of a lack of an effect. A nonresponse situation may be predicted by the observations that continuous 03 exposure, after a period of initial suppression, is followed by reestablishment Figure 1lA . This is supported by our range-finding studies that showed that continuous 0.5 ppm 03 exposure for 10 consecutive days had no effect on AMdependent intrapulmonary bacterial killing of S. aureus, either immediately after cessation of exposure or at 1 and 5 days thereafter (GJ Jakab, unpublished observations).",

The extent to which nutritional factors, health status, age, species variability, genetic background, and immune assay sensitivity interact to play a role on the effect of 0 exposure on the immune system is difficult to unravel from the available data. Mechanistic studies will undoubtedly provide insights into the causes of the observed responses. Questions that beg answers include: a) Is there a level of 03 exposure below which immune responses are enhanced and above which there is a toxic effect that suppresses immune responses? b) What is the mechanism for adaptation? c) Given the fact that 03 itself never reaches the systemic immune compartment, what is the mechanism of 03induced suppression of systemic immunity? d) Where, in the sequence of events that leads to an antigen-stimulated immune response, does 0 have an effect? Is it antigen availability, antigen presentation or a step in the complex cascade of events in the afferent limb of the immune response which may result in altered effector function? As alluded to before, 03 and other oxidant gases are inflammatory when inhaled and thus cause a variety of permeability changes in the lung that could cause an increase in reactive immune tissue (BALT) or increase the availability of antigen to immunoreactive areas.",

The worst case situation for human environmental exposure is in urban areas with concentrations reported as high as 0.36 ppm 0 3. (137) . However, the ambient concentrations of 03 do not reflect the high 03 excursions documented in urban areas. Indeed, most experimental animal studies have had to use 03 exposures in excess of the ambient and spike urban 03 concentrations to demonstrate an immunotoxic effect. In this regard, the study of Selgrade et al. (18) found no effect on multiple immune parameters when rats were chronically exposed to 03 in a way that simulated an urban profile. Finally, in addition to the 03 concentrations, the inferences that can be drawn between human health effects and the battery of immune tests recommended in the National Toxicology Program guidelines for immunotoxicity evaluation in mice (113) need to be clarified.",
