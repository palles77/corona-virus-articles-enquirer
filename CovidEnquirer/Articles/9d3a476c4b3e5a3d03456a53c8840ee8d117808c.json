Our approach has been to develop an efficient liquid-solid separation module using polymer technology and integrate this separation module into systems of treatment technologies for both the separated liquid and solids. We describe the progress that has been made in management techniques and new technological alternatives for manure treatment and generation of value added by-products based on the SELCO-Ecopurin \u00e2 separation technology and experiences during the last five years in 12 livestock farms in Spain, Italy and the USA. High recovery of solids (>90%) makes the use of advanced purification of the liquid a more economical alternative. The liquid can be further treated to reduce N and P and produce effluents virtually free of these nutrients. Production of methane and energy was affected by solids concentration; the anaerobic process was optimised with polymer application rate of 120 ppm during separation and a solids content of 13%.",

One of the main transformations in this treatment is the conversion of ammonia into nitrate through microbial nitrification. There are two advanced processes to raise the concentration of nitrifying bacteria in the reaction tanks; polymer-immobilised nitrifying bacteria (PINBT) and membrane bioreactors (BRM) (Martinez-Almela and Luna, 2002) . The immobilisation process provides a very appropriate environment in order for the microorganisms to reach optimum efficiency. Ammonia nitrogen elimination rates from 915 to 990 mg N/L-reactor/day have been obtained (after the solidliquid separation) and from 97% to 99% nitrification efficiency, without any inhibition in spite of the high rates of ammonia concentration (Vanotti et al., 2000) . The membrane bioreactor is an advanced activated sludge system where membrane filtration replaces the clarifier. Thus, the system is operated with a very high concentration of microbial biomass in the reactors tanks resulting in an increased efficiency and treatment optimisation.",

As an initial approximation we could recommend a level of 8%, but to confirm this further tests have to be carried out. In any event, and in spite of not proved the optimum level, the process is completely feasible for a concentration of 13%, corresponding to a PAMs concentration of 120 ppm, without observing signs of inhibition, nor reduction of the volumetric production of methane, in respect of less concentrated treatments.
