Objectives: To present the epidemiological profile and the main clinical characteristics showed by children infected with this virus in Spain. Study design: We have studied the incidence of HBoV and other 15 respiratory viruses in 917 nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from 730 infants and children under age of 14 with acute lower respiratory tract infection from September-04 to August-06. Results: HBoV was detected in 123 samples (13.4%) showing a seasonal distribution with November and December as the peak months. Out of the 558 samples which rendered a positive result for at least one of the virus tested, HBoV (22%) ranked fourth behind respiratory syncytial virus (181, 32%), adenoviruses (155, 28%) and rhinoviruses (136, 24%). Co-infections with HBoV and other respiratory viruses were detected in 74 out of 123 HBoV-positive specimens (60%). In addition, HBoV was also found in stool and, for the first time, in urine samples. Conclusions: Results obtained provide further evidence that HBoV is involved in acute lower respiratory tract infections. HBoV-associated disease should not be limited to the respiratory tract.",

            "text": "Acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) refers unspecifically to infections of lower airways, either with intrapulmonary shunt (bronchitis and pneumonia) or with dynamic hyperinflation (bronchiolitis and wheeze). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is clearly the major pathogen associated with LRTI during infancy and early childhood. However, parainfluenza viruses (PIV), rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses and influenza viruses are also common known causative agents of LRTI in infants and children. Even so, a specific etiologic agent is often not identified in clinical practice because of lack of sensitive tests for all known agents and the presence of yet unrecognized pathogens. The recently discovered human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human coronavirus NL63 have contributed to resolve the etiological diagnosis in many cases (van den Hoogen et al., 2001; van der Hoek et al., 2004) . However, the proportion of LRTI without an etiological agent associated remains not contemptible. In 2005, human bocavirus (HBoV) was added to the ever expanding list of viruses associated to LRTI in children (Allander et al., 2005) . Shortly after, a worldwide distribution of the virus was evidenced (Arnold et al., 2006; Bastien et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2006; Foulongne et al., 2006; Kaplan et al., 2006; Kesebir et al., 1386-6532/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Amplifications were carried out in a Peltier Thermal Cycler PTC-200 (MJ Research).

A total of 10 l of each second round amplification product was subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose in 0.5\u00d7 TBE gel stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 g/ml), and visualized under UV light.

Out of the 917 NPA specimens studied, a total of 123 tested positive for HBoV, accounting for 13.4%. This high incidence of HBoV infection observed in our study population, which consisted mainly in hospitalized patients, are in accordance with rates previously published ranging from 10.3% to 19% (Allander et al., 2007; Choi et al., 2006; Kaplan et al., 2006; Kleines et al., 2007; Smuts and Hardie, 2006; Weissbrich et al., 2006) .

Rather than geographic differences in HBoV circulation, this discrepancy may be explained by differences observed in the patients studied. Several studies included exclusively hospitalized children while others enrolled either hospitalized and outpatient children. In the same way, several studies are focused on LRTI patients and others are based on patients with less severe lung disease, or infants and young children versus adults patients. In addition, differences observed in the incidence of HBoV infection could also be due to the variety of respiratory samples taken from patients, or alternatively to differences inherent in sensitivity of PCR assays employed.",

Nevertheless, diarrhea is a relatively common symptom presented in patients with HBoV infection (Arnold et al., 2006; Kesebir et al., 2006) . The presence of HBoV in stool and urine samples may merely reflect the excretion of the virus by the digestive and urinary tracts, but also could be considered suggestive of other manifestations of HBoV-associated disease, not limited to the respiratory tract. As a support of this hypothesis, detection of HBoV in serum specimens taken from children with an episode of acute wheezing has recently been published (Allander et al., 2007) .

In this study, HBoV was co-detected with one or more respiratory viruses in 74 out of 123 HBoV-positive specimens (60%). This high co-infection rate found in our patients is agreed with other series published (Allander et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006; Sloots et al., 2006) . High co-infections rates is not in opposition to a pathogenic role of HBoV in respiratory dis-eases. In fact, the only study to date including asymptomatic control infants reported a zero incidence of HBoV infection in this group, then providing a statistical association of the virus with disease (Kesebir et al., 2006) .",

Nevertheless, it might be a reflect that infants and children, as well as occurs with other respiratory viruses, could be re-infected with HBoV, twice at least in the same season. Unfortunately, urine and stool specimens could not been collected from these three patients.",
