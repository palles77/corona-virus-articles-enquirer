            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection in murine 17Cl-1 cells results in apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of MHV-induced apoptosis by the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK promoted virus production late in infection, indicating that apoptosis could be a host response to limit the production of viral progeny. Activation of the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway was indicated by the activation of caspase-9 and delay of apoptosis by Bcl-2 overexpression. Analyses of the subcellular distribution of cytochrome c, procaspase-9, and Apaf-1 suggested an aberrant apoptosome formation in the vicinity of the mitochondria, which could be a cell type-specific event. An increase in the amount of Fas (APO-1/CD95), caspase-8 activation, caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage, and subsequent translocation of truncated Bid to mitochondria, all of which relate to the Fas-mediated pathway, also occurred in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells, whereas the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex, a direct indication of the activation of Fas-mediated pathway, was undetectable. Caspase-8 and Bid activation appeared to be downstream of mitochondria, because Bcl-2 overexpression suppressed both events, suggesting that infected 17Cl-1 cells might have activated a receptor-mediated \"type II\" signaling pathway, in which primary and low levels of receptor-mediated pathway activation lead to the activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway. All our data indicate that a mitochondria-mediated pathway played a major regulatory role in apoptosis in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells.",

            "text": "Viral infection may trigger a variety of host cellular responses, and one outcome of virus-host interaction is the activation of an innate cell death machinery, called programmed cell death, or apoptosis; many viruses and viral proteins are capable of inducing apoptosis (reviewed by O'Brien, 1998; Teodoro and Branton, 1997) . The induction of apoptosis upon viral infection has been hypothesized to be a host-defense response, since early death of virus-infected cells would prevent viral replication. Many viruses have developed a countermeasure(s) that effectively blocks or delays cell death by expressing antiapoptotic proteins to maximize the production of viral progeny (reviewed by Hardwick, 1998; O'Brien, 1998; Teodoro and Branton, 1997) . On the other hand, apoptosis induction at the end of the viral replication cycle might assist in viral dissemination, while attenuating an inflammatory response. Apparently viruses have evolved to regulate apoptosis, which may directly or indirectly contribute to viral pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Apoptosis usually involves the activation of a family of cysteine proteases named caspases, which cleave a variety of cellular substrates, and the cleavage of certain important protein targets leads to detrimental biochemical and morphological changes and eventual cell destruction (reviewed by Earnshaw et al., 1999; Nicholson, 1999) . Caspases are synthesized as proenzymes, which require cleavage for their activation. Initiator caspases, such as caspase-8 and -9, undergo self-cleavage and activation upon receiving apoptotic signals. These upstream caspases then activate effector caspases, such as caspase-3, -6, and -7, which execute the cleavage of other cellular substrates. Caspase cascades can be activated by two major pathways. In one pathway, different stimuli converge death signals to mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial damage and the release of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm, where it forms apoptosome complexes with Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 in the presence of dATP, leading to the activation of caspase-9 (Li et al., 1997; Saleh et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1999) . The other pathway initiates from cell surface death receptors, such as Fas (CD95/APO-1) and TNF-R1. Engagement of these receptors by their cognate ligands results in the aggregation of intracellular death domains and the recruitment of FADD and procaspase-8, forming the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), where caspase-8 is activated (Kischkel et al., 1995; Medema et al., 1997) .",

Addition of 150 M Z-VAD-FMK to 17Cl-1 cells that were infected with the A59 strain of MHV (MHV-A59) inhibited the production of apoptotic DNA fragments (Fig.  1A) . MHV-A59 infection causes extensive cell fusion in 17Cl-1 cells ; almost all fused cells detach from the culture dish after 20 h postinfection (p.i.). MHV infection still caused syncytia in the presence of Z-VAD-FMK, yet most of the fused cells remained adherent on the culture dish for up to 48 h, the end point of the experiments.

            "text": "The antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein has been known to block apoptosis by maintaining the integrity of mitochondrial membranes and preventing the release of apoptosis-activating factors, such as cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), from mitochondria (Kluck et al., 1997; Susin et al., 1999b; Yang et al., 1997) . To determine whether the mitochondria-mediated pathway was activated during MHV-induced apoptosis, we examined the effect of Bcl-2 overexpression on MHV-induced apoptosis. Three 17Cl-1 cell lines that stably overexpressed Bcl-2 (17Cl-1/bcl-2) and two control 17Cl-1 cell lines that stably expressed the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (17Cl-1/neo) were established. These cells were infected with MHV-A59 or mock infected. MHV-infected 17Cl-1/neo and 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells showed syncytia for-mation, as seen in MHV-infected parental 17Cl-1 cells. The infected 17Cl-1/neo cells started to detach from the culture dish after 14 h p.i., whereas the majority of infected 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells remained attached to the dish for up to 24 h p.i. At 18 h p.i., cells were collected and suspended in staining solutions containing propidium iodide. Nuclear DNA was stained by propidium iodide and the samples were applied for flow cytometric analysis, in which the proportion of nuclei containing subdiploid DNA contents, i.e., apoptotic nuclei, was determined. As shown in Fig. 2A , MHV-induced apoptosis was blocked in all three 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cell lines, but not in both 17Cl-1/neo cell lines. However, when the cultures were incubated further, infected 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells became detached from the culture dish late in infection (data not shown). Consistent with the observed cytopathogenicity, accumulation of apoptotic DNA fragments occurred in infected 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells at 32 h p.i. (Fig. 2B , top panel, lanes 2 and 5), indicating that MHV-infected 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells eventually died by apoptosis. Western blot analysis of Bcl-2 protein revealed the appearance of an additional band with an approximate molecular weight of 23 kDa (\u232cBcl-2) in infected 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells, but not in uninfected cells (Fig. 2B, bottom panel) . It is known that Bcl-2 can be cleaved by caspase-3, producing a 23-kDa proteolytic fragment (Cheng et al., 1997) . Treatment of Z-VAD-FMK blocked both apoptosis and Bcl-2 cleavages (Fig. 2B , lanes 3 and 6), suggesting that certain caspases, probably caspase-3, cleaved Bcl-2 late in infected 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells. The finding that overexpression of Bcl-2 delayed MHV-induced apoptosis indicated the involvement of the mitochondria-mediated pathway in MHV-induced cell death in 17Cl-1 cells.",

No procaspase-9 cleavage occurred in mock-infected cells. p35 is known to be produced by autocleavage of procaspase-9 when the apoptosome complex is formed, while p37 is produced by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of procaspase-9 (Srinivasula et al., 1998) .

            "text": "Association of cytochrome c with mitochondria led us to explore a possibility that the apoptosome complex may be formed in the vicinity of mitochondria in apoptotic 17Cl-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B , procaspase-9 was found in both mitochondria and cytoplasm in mock-infected cells (Fig. 3B , lanes 1 and 2). Notably, in both MHV-infected and etoposide-treated 17Cl-1 cells, the majority of mitochondria-associated procaspase-9 underwent cleavage, and the autocleavage fragment, p35, was detected in the mitochondrial fractions ( Fig. 3B , lanes 3 and 5), suggesting that apoptosome might have been formed in a location associated with mitochondria. The caspase-9 cleavage fragment p37 was also present in the mitochondria of MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 3B , lane 3), indicating that caspase-3-mediated cleavage of procaspase-9 occurred in the mitochondria. If apoptosome is formed in a location associated with mitochondria, then Apaf-1, another component of the apoptosome complex, should be detected in the mitochondrial fraction. In mock-infected nonapoptotic 17Cl-1 cells, a significant amount of Apaf-1 was detected in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 3B, lane 1) , while there was a clear decrease in the amount of mitochondrial Apaf-1 in MHVinfected cells (Fig. 3B, lane 3) . The decrease of mitochondrial Apaf-1 in infected 17Cl-1 cells could be due to caspase-3-mediated cleavage, as reported previously (Lauber et al., 2001) . Although we did not examine the subcellular localization of caspase-3, it is known that procaspase-3 has a cytosolic and mitochondrial distribution in nonapoptotic cells (Mancini et al., 1998) . It is possible that the mitochondrial apoptosome formation may directly lead to the activation of mitochondria-associated procaspase-3 in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells. In The 17Cl-1/bcl-2 and 17Cl-1/neo cell clones were mock infected (blank bars) or infected with MHV (filled bars) at an m.o.i. of 10. Cells were collected at 18 h p.i., and the populations of apoptotic nuclei with subdiploid DNA contents were determined as described under Materials and Methods. The results are expressed as the means of two independent experiments. (B) Two 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cell clones (clones 3 and 7) were mock infected (lanes 1 and 4) or infected with MHV at an m.o.i. of 10 in the presence (lanes 3 and 6) or the absence (lanes 2 and 5) of Z-VAD-FMK. At 32 h p.i., low-molecular-weight DNA was extracted and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel (top), and total cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis and probed for Bcl-2 (bottom).",

Mitochondrial pathway activation in 17Cl-1 cells appeared to involve an unusual formation of apoptosome complex in the vicinity of the mitochondria, possibly in the intermembrane space or on the outer membrane of mitochondria. This unique phenotype of mitochondrial pathway activation seems to be cell type specific, rather than stimuli specific. We have tried to further characterize this phenomenon by treating 17Cl-1 cells with staurosporine, a broad-range protein kinase inhibitor that induces apoptosis in other cell types through the activation of the mitochondrial pathway (Kluck et al., 1997; Yang et al., 1997) . However, treatment of 17Cl-1 cells with 5 M staurosporine for 24 h did not 1-4) .

The 17Cl-1 cells were mock infected (Mock), infected with MHV (MHV), or treated with etoposide (Etoposide). At 16 h p.i. and 18 h after etoposide treatment, cells were collected and subjected to subcellular fractionation.

Since receptor-mediated apoptosis is Bcl-2-insensitive, we then investigated whether any receptor-mediated pathway was activated during MHV-induced apoptosis. We first examined the activation of caspase-8, an apical caspase that is activated in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4A , procaspase-8 was cleaved into the p18 fragment late in infection.

Characterization of the subcellular localization of tBid clearly demonstrated that the majority of both p15 and p7 tBid fragments localized in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 5B) , which is consistent with previous find- ings by others that p7 and p15 fragments form a tight, noncovalent complex after cleavage by caspase-8 (Chou et al., 1999; Zha et al., 2000) , and myristoylated p15 inserts into mitochondrial membranes (Zha et al., 2000) .

            "text": "Activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway results in the formation of an apoptosome complex, in which procaspase-9 undergoes autocleavage to produce the p35 fragment (Srinivasula et al., 1998; Zou et al., 1999) . Bcl-2 protein is known to maintain the integrity of mitochondrial membranes and prevent the release of apoptosis-activating factors, such as cytochrome c and AIF, from mitochondria (Kluck et al., 1997; Susin et al., 1999b; Yang et al., 1997) . Therefore, production of caspase-9 fragment p35 in MHV-infected cells and sup-pression of apoptosis in 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells strongly suggested activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells. Unexpectedly, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, another hallmark of mitochondria-mediated pathway activation, was not evident in infected 17Cl-1 cells. In addition, the other two components of apoptosome, caspase-9 and Apaf-1, were both found to have a mitochondrial distribution in nonapoptotic 17Cl-1 cells. When cells underwent apoptosis after MHV infection, most of the mitochondria-associated procaspase-9 and Apaf-1 were cleaved, and the caspase-9 fragment p35, which is known to be produced in the apoptosome (Zou et al., 1999) , was also found in the mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 3B, lane 3) . These data suggested that apoptosome formation occurred in mitochondria, probably on the mitochondrial outer membrane or in the intermembrane space, in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells. When 17Cl-1 cells were treated with etoposide, a known reagent that activates the mitochondria-mediated pathway (Kluck et al., 1997; Yang et al., 1997) , both cytochrome c and caspase-9 fragment p35 were also found to accumulate in the mitochondrial fraction, indicating that the formation of apoptosome in mitochondria was not stimuli specific; rather, it was more likely to be a unique feature of 17Cl-1 cells. Several previous studies indicate that cytochrome c accumulation in the cytosol during apoptosis is a cell type-and inducer-dependent phenomenon (Adachi et al., 1998; Chauhan et al., 1997; Tang et al., 1998) , and the formation of apoptosome in the mitochondrial intermembrane space was also suggested in a previous report (Adachi et al., 1998) . Although cytochrome c, Apaf-1, and procaspase-9 were present in the mitochondria, apoptosome was not formed in untreated 17Cl-1 cells, indicating that these components are probably located in different compartments of the mitochondria. We speculate that in apoptotic 17Cl-1 cells, the mitochondrial structure may undergo certain modifications to allow the apoptosome components to interact and form the complex. It has been shown recently that tBid induces a striking remodeling of the mitochondrial structure with mobilization of the cytochrome c stores in cristae (Scorrano et al., 2002) . In MHV-infected cells, caspase-9 cleavage fragment p37 was also detected in the mitochondrial fraction, indicating the presence of mitochondria-associated caspase-3 activity. The presence of procaspase-3 and procaspase-9 in the mitochondria is not unexpected, since both procaspases have been reported to have cytosolic and mitochondrial distributions (Mancini et al., 1998; Susin et al., 1999a) .",

            "text": "Based on the data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 , we suspect that the integrity of mitochondrial membranes was altered in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells; we currently do not know what molecule(s) caused the mitochondrial membrane damage in the first place (see Fig. 7 , Model 1). We speculate that the alteration in the integrity of mitochondrial membranes triggered the activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway. Recent studies indicated that caspase-8 can be activated by caspase-3, probably via caspase-6 (Slee et al., 1999; Tang et al., 2000) . It is possible that a similar or the same caspase activation cascade occurred in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells. Namely, activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway results in the activation of caspase-9 (Fig. 3) and caspase-3 (data not shown), which then may activate the downstream caspase-6 and caspase-8 (Fig. 4) . Caspase-8 cleaves Bid to produce tBid fragments, which then relocates to the mitochondria (Fig. 5B ) to further disturb mitochondrial membranes; translocation of tBid to the mitochondria amplifies the mitochondrial pathway activation. In this model, the accumulation of proapoptotic signals that cause mitochondrial damage overcomes the antiapoptotic function of overexpressed Bcl-2 in 17Cl-1/ bcl-2 cells. Once a low level of mitochondrial pathway activation starts in 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells, it leads to caspase-3 activation and subsequent Bcl-2 cleavage; cleaved Bcl-2 does not protect the integrity of mitochondria; instead, it has proapoptotic activities (Cheng et al., 1997) . A continuous increase in the amount of caspase-3-mediated Bcl-2 cleavage and accumulation of proapoptotic tBid in the mitochondrial membranes overwhelm the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2, ultimately leading to cell death.",

            "text": "The receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway is another major pathway in activating caspase cascades. In this pathway, DISC formation leads to caspase-8 activation. Activated caspase-8 then activates caspase-3 and Bid. Although caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage did occur in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells (Figs. 4 and 5) , it is less likely that these two events were efficiently activated by the direct death receptor activation, because Bcl-2 overexpression efficiently blocked caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage (Fig. 6 ). If the receptor-mediated pathway plays the major direct role in caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage, then both events should have occurred in 17Cl-1/bcl-2 cells; overexpression of Bcl-2 should block only the mitochondria-mediated pathway, but not the receptor-mediated pathway. Caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage may occur in MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells through either the same or a similar apoptotic mechanism as that found in type II cells (Scaffidi et al., 1998 (Scaffidi et al., , 1999 ) (see Fig. 7 , Model 2). In this model, the increased Fas protein in infected 17Cl-1 cells results in a very low level of DISC formation, which we were unable to detect. This putative low level of DISC is able to activate a limited amount of caspase-8. Activated caspase-8 then cleaves caspase-3 and Bid. The p15 tBid relocates to mitochondria and activates the mitochondrial pathway. Once the mitochondrial pathway is activated, subsequent activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-8 follows, as discussed above. In 17Cl-1/ bcl-2 cells, caspase-3 activated by these mechanisms also cleaves Bcl-2, producing the proapoptotic \u232cBcl-2 fragment. If MHV-infected 17Cl-1 cells undergo an apoptotic pathway similar to that in type II cells, then the increase of Fas late in infection may play an important role in the regulation of apoptosis.",
