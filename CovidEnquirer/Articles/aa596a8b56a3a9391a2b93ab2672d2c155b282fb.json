They compare well with the sensitivity of virus culture. PCR followed by liquid-phase hybridization is a sensitive method for detecting adenovirus DNA and enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA in clinical specimens. IgG EIA on paired acute and convalescent phase sera is the most sensitive serological test for respiratory virus infections and is a valuable reference method when evaluating the sensitivity of new diagnostic tests. The IgG avidity test can distinguish primary infections from re-infections at least in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. IgM antibody assays, on the other hand, had low sensitivities in our studies.",

Virus culture, whenever possible, should be the basic diagnostic method; the results, including identification of the virus, should be available no more than 24 h later than the results of rapid diagnostic tests. In small laboratories, especially in hospitals where specimen transportation is well organized, immunofluorescence may be the best choice for antigen detection with the provision that an experienced microscopist and a good UV microscope are available. If the laboratory receives a large number of specimens and has previous experience with EIAs, then biotin-EIAs or TR-FIAs may be the most practical techniques. Their advantages include the stability of the antigens in clinical samples since intact, exfoliated epithelial cells are not required, treatment of specimens is practical, testing of large numbers of specimens is possible, and reading the printed test result is less subjective than reading fluorescence microscopy. The larger role of PCR in the diagnosis of respiratory virus infections depends on future developments such as practical methods to extract DNA or RNA and to purify the extracts from nonspecific inhibitors, plus further improvements to minimize cross-contamination.",

Rapid diagnostic methods are of particular importance for respiratory viruses since they have short incubation periods and epidemics spread quickly, even globally. The improvements in respiratory virus diagnostic methods include introduction of more sensitive cell lines for virus culture and an early detection of viral antigens in these cultures by immunoperoxidase staining (IPS) with monoclonal antibodies (rapid culture assay), application of monoclonal antibodies for immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) detection of viral antigens directly in clinical specimens, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of viral DNA or RNA in clinical specimens followed by demonstration of specific PCR products with liquid-phase hybridization. This review focuses on our 15-year experience in the development of these diagnostic methods for respiratory viruses and particularly on the newer trends. More conventional techniques are only briefly discussed.",

For virus culture, a cotton stick is dipped into the freshly collected aspirate specimen and then placed in viral transport medium. Specimens for virus isolation and for immunofluorescence assays (IFA) must be kept refrigerated until they are processed in the laboratory. If specimens for virus isolation cannot be processed within 48 h, storage at -70\u00b0C should be considered.

Viral antigens are detected in cell cultures by immunological staining 16-48 h after inoculation, usually before a distinct, virus induced CPE is microscopically visible. Cells are grown in shell vials or in 24-well cell culture dishes. Clinical specimens are inoculated into an adequate number of vials or wells, and the cultures are then centrifuged at approximately 700 x g at ambient temperature for 30-60 rain. It has been documented that this centrifuged inoculation increases the sensitivity of the rapid culture assay for a number of viruses. Thereafter, the cultures are incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for an appropriate period. Next, the culture medium is removed, the cells are washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed with acetone or methanol. For cells grown in plastic dishes, acetone should be used at a concentration of 80% in PBS, as undiluted acetone will melt the plastic. Viral antigens in the cultured cells are detected by IFA or by IPA. For IFA, cultures are usually grown on coverslips in shell vials, and after staining, the coverslips are mounted on microscope slides. IPA staining can be performed in the 24-well plates and read at 40 x 100 x magnification with an inverted microscope. Under optimal conditions viral plaques can grow large enough during an overnight incubation that they can be identified by the naked eye after staining (Ziegler et al., 1988 (Ziegler et al., , 1995 . The theoretical sensitivity of rapid culture assays is one infectious virus per inoculation volume.",

We need a more efficient and simple method for the extraction and purification of DNA and RNA, a simple test for specific identification of PCR products and preferably a more practical DNA amplification technique, such as isothermal amplification (Walker et al., 1992) . Before a new extraction and purification method is developed, we need internal controls for checking the removal of inhibitors from each individual specimen. Otherwise, negative results may not be correct. We also need improved methods to control for cross-contaminations. This requires, in addition, that we minimize the possibilities of contaminating specimens at the time of specimen collection and handling, i.e. before they even reach the laboratory. Such contamination problems are difficult to avoid, if the assay sensitivity is at the level of one DNA or RNA molecule. Some of these problems might be overcome by lowering the sensitivity of PCR. It is likely that a less sensitive PCR system still would pick up most, if not all, isolation-positive specimens. The most natural targets for PCR diagnosis of respiratory infections are those with difficulties in culture or identification, such as coronaviruses. Broad tests such as group reacting rhinovirus and enterovirus tests are also examples of future respiratory virus PCRs.",
