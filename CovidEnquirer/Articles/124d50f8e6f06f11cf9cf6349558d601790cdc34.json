Chronic HCV infection affects 2.2% of the world's population and is known to be the leading factor necessitating liver transplantation in patients in developed countries. No vaccine is available for HCV and the current treatment, which consists of administering pegylated interferon \u03b1 and ribavirin, has limited efficacy against certain HCV genotypes, and also produces significant adverse effects (reviewed in ref. 1) . The development of alternative, specific therapies for chronic HCV infection is therefore a major public health objective.",

            "text": "HCV, a member of the Flaviviridae family, contains a singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome that encodes a unique precursor polyprotein; this polyprotein is further processed into structural proteins and nonstructural proteins, thereby ensuring genome replication. The long open reading frame is flanked by 5 and 3 nontranslated regions (NTRs) that are highly conserved among the majority of HCV genotypes and contain elements that are essential for genome replication (reviewed in ref. 1 ). In addition, HCV 5 NTR contains a highly structured element, namely, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which is essential for the initiation of HCV polyprotein translation. 2 Anti-HCV drug development has been hampered both by the lack of efficient cell culture systems that support virus replication and by the unavailability of accessible animal models. HCV subgenomic RNA replicon systems 3 have permitted the assaying of the inhibitory effect of antiviral candidates on HCV genome replication in vitro in human hepatoma cells. The recent development of stable cell culture systems permitting robust production of infectious HCV particles in vitro, based on the JFH-1 strain of HCV genotype 2a, 4 will facilitate the investigation and testing of new antiviral strategies. In addition, alternative animal models that have recently been developed seem to show promise in evaluating candidate antiviral therapeutics. These animal models include transgenic mice engrafted with human hepatocytes, 5 as well as nonendangered primate species (tamarins, marmosets) infected by GB virus B, a hepatotropic virus that is closely related to HCV, 6, 7 or by GB virus B derivatives containing functional HCV sequences. 8 Among possible therapeutic strategies, RNA interference (RNAi) is an attractive path to explore. First described as a natural defense mechanism against plant viruses, RNAi was subsequently shown to be a universal phenomenon of post-transcriptional gene silencing, which is initiated by double-stranded RNA and leads to specific degradation of homologous RNAs. This process involves the generation of 21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) which, in association with a multiprotein complex named \"RNA induced silencing complex\", are used as guides to target specific RNA substrates by Watson-Crick base-pairing. Such siRNAs, when introduced directly into mammalian cells or expressed from viral vectors, can lead to the degradation of targeted sequences (reviewed in ref. 9 ). During the past few years, RNAi has been extensively investigated as an alternative specific therapy to treat cancers, genetic diseases, and infections by various human pathogens of medical importance, using both in vitro and in vivo model systems (reviewed in refs. 10, 11) . RNA viruses, in particular viruses with liver tropism such as HCV, are ideal candidates for nucleic acid-based therapies that have been shown to efficiently target the liver (reviewed in ref. 12) . Recently, various studies have reported variable inhibitory effects of HCV-specific synthetic siR-NAs or small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) expressed from viral vectors, that target sequences encoding various HCV nonstructural proteins as well as sequences within the 5 NTR. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] These studies all relied on the use of HCV subgenomic or genomic replicon models in cell culture.",

            "text": "In order to investigate the potency of virus-specific siRNAs in inhibiting HCV infection, we selected seven siRNAs that target conserved sequences of the pivotal domain (domain III) of the HCV IRES within the 5 NTR 2 (Figure 1a) . This domain is particularly important for initiation of polyprotein translation, as it directly contacts 40S ribosomal subunits 22 and binds translation initiation factor 3, eIF3. 23 Domain III has also been reported to be involved to some extent in genome replication. 24 siRNAs were designed essentially according to previously described criteria; in particular, whenever possible, the asymmetric thermostability of siRNA duplexes was respected. 25, 26 As a messenger, HCV positive strand RNA genome is an ideal target for siR-NAs, but it harbors strong secondary and tertiary structures, in particular within the IRES. This makes it difficult to design optimal siRNAs according to the criteria referred to earlier. On the other hand, the high nucleotide conservation of this region The footprints of the seven HCV-specific siRNAs selected to target the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) are represented on the schematic structure of domains III-IV of the 5 nontranslated region (NTR) from the H77 strain of HCV genotype 1a. 2 siRNA si240 targets a viral sequence that contains a nucleotide change in HCV genotype 1a and 1b sequences, as indicated. (b) The two replicons used in this study, Ntat2Aneo 21 and NNeo 20 with 5 NTRs derived from HCV genotype 1a and 1b strains, respectively, are schematically represented, with cell culture adaptive mutations (S2005I in NS5A and R2889G in NS5B, respectively) indicated by arrowheads. Both replicons encode neomycine phosphotransferase (Neo) C-terminally fused to either human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein followed by foot-and-mouth disease virus autocatalytically cleaved 2A protein (Ntat2ANeo), or to a few amino acid residues from core protein ( C in NNeo). permitted the identification of siRNAs that were homologous to several HCV genotypes ( Table 1) . Selected siRNAs were named according to the nucleotide position within the genome of the H77 strain of HCV genotype 1a 27 that corresponds to the first 5 nucleotide targeted by the siRNA antisense strand: si205, si214, si240-1a, si240-1b, si244, si284, si313 ( Table 1) . siRNA si313 targets the 3 end of domain III and 5 end of domain IV involved in a pseudo-knot located upstream from the initiator codon (Figure 1a) . The sequences of all siRNAs, with the exception of si240, matched both HCV genotype sequences 1a and 1b that were present in the subgenomic replicons used in the first part of the study (Figure 1b) . Two siRNAs si240 (si240-1a and si240-1b) were synthesized with sequences homologous to genotypes 1a and 1b, respectively. When targeted to genotype 1b 5 NTR, si240-1a formed a G:U wobble base-pairing at position 18 of the siRNA antisense strand, whereas si240-1b formed an A:C mismatch with the genotype 1a replicon (Figure 1c ). The G:U non-canonical base-pairing is known to be non-disruptive in double-stranded RNA structures and both G:U wobble basepairing and A:C mismatch, if present at certain positions of the siRNA, were recently reported to be well tolerated for siRNAmediated gene silencing. [28] [29] [30] [31] Therefore, we proceeded to analyze the effects of si240-1a and si240-1b on both homologous and heterologous replicon targets. Finally, as a non-specific, negative control in these experiments, we used an irrelevant siRNA, referred to as siIRR ( Table 1) , that had previously been used for targeting a sequence within the 5 NTR of a poliovirus strain, 30 and that did not share homology with the HCV sequence.",

Following coelectroporation of En5-3 cells with 5 \u03bcg of in vitro-transcribed Ntat2ANeo RNA and 2 \u03bcg of each synthetic siRNA, the culture supernatant was replaced daily with fresh medium during the first 4 days after transfection and then on day 7, and SEAP activity was measured in all culture supernatants collected. During the first 2 days, SEAP signals essentially reflected translation of the input RNAs, since SEAP levels were roughly similar in cells transfected with Ntat2ANeo replicon and those transfected with a replication-defective RNA encoding an inactive NS5B RNA polymerase deleted in its active site (\u0394GDD, see Materials and Methods). RNA replication was then clearly detected between days 3 and 7 after transfection (Figure 2a , compare SEAP levels in cells transfected with Ntat2ANeo and \u0394GDD). Cotransfection of the irrelevant siRNA (siIRR) did not significantly affect Ntat2ANeo replication (Figure 2a) . HCVspecific siRNAs si214 and si284 showed only transient and nil effect on HCV replication, respectively, and SEAP expression levels on day 7 after transfection were similar to those induced by transfection of Ntat2ANeo alone (Figure 2a) . These two siRNAs were therefore not further utilized in the course of our study. In sharp contrast, siRNAs si205, si240-1a, si240-1b, si244, and si313 proved capable of abolishing HCV replication in this system, yielding SEAP levels as low as those obtained with replication-defective RNA \u0394GDD. In the presence of these siRNAs, SEAP levels were even slightly lower at days 1, 2, and 3 after transfection than those obtained with \u0394GDD, as a result of siRNA-mediated degradation of input RNAs, rendering them unavailable for translation (Figure 2a) . The inhibitory effect of these five siRNAs on HCV replication was shown to be prolonged to 14 days after transfection (data not shown).",

From these experiments, inhibition doses 50 were calculated for each siRNA (Figure 2b) . The siRNAs si240-1a and si244 proved to be the most efficient inhibitors of HCV RNA replication with inhibition doses 50 of 19 ng (0.64 nmol/l) and 33 ng (1.11 nmol/l), respectively, and all siRNAs exhibited inhibition doses 50 within the 19-141 ng range. The inhibition dose 50 of si240-1b (127 ng) was shown to be substantially higher than that of si240-1a (19 ng), in agreement with the fact that si240-1b is not fully homologous to Ntat2ANeo 5 NTR (genotype 1a). This demonstrates the sequence-specificity of these siRNAs. We also found that the co-administration of two siRNAs targeting nonoverlapping HCV sequences, in suboptimal doses, resulted in additive inhibitory effects (data not shown). This might prove useful in future studies in which a strategy based on combined siRNAs is sought to be developed in order to prevent the occurrence of escape mutations. The five siRNAs (si205, si240-1a, si240-1b, si244, and si313) that specifically target domain III of the HCV IRES and strongly inhibit subgenomic RNA replicon replication when used in the nanomolar range were retained in the remaining part of the study.

This was done by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using an HCV primer pair that allows amplification of a 1630 base-pair fragment spanning the NS3 coding region, as well as a primer pair that allows the detection of a housekeeping messenger RNA (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) for the purpose of RNA quantity normalization (Figure 2c ). HCV RNA was readily detected in similar abundance in cells transfected with Ntat2ANeo or cotransfected with Ntat2ANeo and siIRR (Figure 2c , lanes 4, 5). Very low levels of residual transfected \u0394GDD RNA molecules could be occasionally detected under these experimental conditions (Figure 2c, lane 3) . In duplicate experiments, using cells cotransfected with Ntat2ANeo and si240-1a, si244, or si313, viral RNA was either not detected or detected at very low levels, comparable to the results obtained with \u0394GDD RNA (Figure  2c , lanes 8-13).

The ongoing replication of Ntat2ANeo replicon in these cells was reflected by SEAP levels that were more than tenfold higher than in transient experiments after HCV replicon electroporation. Two micrograms of each siRNA were electroporated into these cells, and their effect on HCV RNA replication was determined at different timepoints. Data obtained at day 7 after transfection, corresponding to cumulative SEAP levels secreted between days 4 and 7, are represented in Figure 3 . The SEAP activity generated by the HCV replicon in the presence of either of the homologous siRNAs was reduced by 50% or more relative to that of Ntat2ANeo in mock-transfected cells. When a higher dose (5 \u03bcg) of siRNAs was used, SEAP activity was reduced by 70-93% (data not shown). The siRNA-mediated inhibitory effect was not as dramatic as in cotransfection experiments, probably due, in part, to limited transfection efficiency (~70%, data not shown), thereby permitting ongoing RNA replication in cells that did not receive siRNA in the transfected culture. In addition, viral RNAs undergoing replication within replication complexes may be less accessible than transfected viral RNAs to siRNAs. Nonetheless, we demonstrated strong, dose-dependent inhibitory potency of HCV domain III-specific siRNAs in cells supporting continuous HCV RNA replication.",

In these experiments, we used the HCV replicon-free subclone 2-3c of Huh7 cells, 32 and either Ntat2ANeo or NNeo replicon. In contrast to Ntat2ANeo, NNeo replicon (see Figure 1b and ref. 20) contains a 5 NTR derived from the N strain of genotype 1b and encodes neomycine phosphotransferase gene in the first cistron. 2-3c cells were coelectroporated with either Ntat2ANeo or NNeo replicon and each siRNA, then placed under G418 selective pressure. G418resistant cell clones were counted on day 21 after transfection. Data from two or three experiments carried out with each replicon were pooled for siRNAs homologous to both replicons (si205, si244, si313), and the mean of these data is shown in Figure 4 . A mean of 34,000 \u00b1 23,800 resistant cell clones was obtained after transfection of HCV replicon alone. The data are represented with respect to 10,000 G418-resistant clones in each experiment. Treatment with each of the HCV-specific siRNAs resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of G418-resistant cell clones (Figure 4) . siRNA si205 reduced the formation of G418-resistant cell clones by ~2 logs, whereas si244 and si313 reduced cell clone formation by 3 logs or more (Figure 4a) . This is in good correlation with results obtained in the SEAP reporter system. Both si240-1a and si240-1b were more efficient on their homologous target than on heterologous targets (Figure 4b) . The nature and the position of the mismatch between si240 and its target (G:U and A:C for si240-1a on HCV genotype 1b and si240-1b on genotype 1a, respectively, at nucleotide 18 of the siRNA antisense strand) are reasonably well tolerated by the RNAi machinery, resulting in ~2 log reduction in G418-resistant cell clone formation, an inhibition that was, however, 1-1.5 log less efficient than on homologous targets. These experiments confirmed, as already described, 28, 29, 31 that perfect base-pairing between siRNAs and targeted messenger RNA is required for most effective silencing.",

In contrast, si244 was shown to hybridize to the JFH-1 5 NTR with a C:A mismatch at the third position of the siRNA antisense strand (see Figure 1c) . Such a mismatch at the 5 end of the antisense strand is expected to hamper RNAi. 29, 33 For this reason, we also used an engineered chimeric virus that contains 5 NTR and core-coding sequences derived from genotype 1a within the backbone of the JFH-1 genome (JFH-1/C(+) 6 (Figure 5a) . In contrast, HCV-specific siRNA si313 considerably reduced the number of cells infected with either JFH-1 or the chimeric virus (Figure 5a) . Similarly, si244 efficiently inhibited infection with the 1a/2a chimeric virus (Figure 5a, left) , but had only a weak effect, if any, on JFH-1 infection (Figure 5a , right), consistent with the existing mismatch between si244 and genotype 2a 5 NTR (see Figure 1c) . Interestingly, si240-1a siRNA also appeared to have a higher inhibitory effect on the infection with the chimeric virus (Figure 5a , left) than with JFH-1 (Figure 5a, right) , in spite of perfect homology with the 5 NTR sequences of both viruses. We hypothesized that these differential effects of si240-1a might be linked to delayed replication kinetics of the chimeric 1a/2a virus, as compared to JFH-1 (D. Delgrange, A. Pillez, L. Cocquerel, G. Paranhos-Baccala, Y. Rouill\u00e9, J. Dubuisson et al., unpublished results), a phenotype that may impact on target/siRNA ratios at early time-points following infection. The effects of the three siRNAs on both viruses were also monitored by Western blot analysis of E2 expression in infected cells (Figure 5b) . The data obtained confirmed that si313 is the most efficient siRNA, causing complete inhibition of E2 expression in cells infected with either JFH-1 or JFH-1/ C(+)6-1a.",

            "text": "In exploring RNAi as a potential new therapeutic approach against HCV infection, one of the reasons for our choice to target domain III of the HCV 5 NTR was that domain III contains well-conserved nucleotide sequences across all HCV genotypes ( Table 1) . 34 The high degree of conservation seen in these sequences may be required for preserving virus function, since this 5 NTR domain controls the initiation of polyprotein translation and modulates RNA replication. 23, 24 Recent nuclear magnetic resonance and electron cryomicroscopy studies of domain III 22, 35, 36 have helped identify the structure-function relationships of the various subdomains of domain III. The results of these studies suggest that subdomains IIIa/c and IIId, as well as subdomain IIIf that forms a pseudoknot structure (Figure 1a) , directly contact the 40S subunit body and act synergistically for the proper positioning of the AUG codon. In the present study, si240 and si244 (that hybridize to subdomain IIId) and si313 (that essentially hybridizes to the IIIf pseudoknot), therefore target regions that are essential for IRES structural integrity and functioning. These three siRNAs proved able, at low doses in the nanomolar range, to substantially reduce or even abolish HCV subgenomic RNA replication, as measured by reporter SEAP activities and G418-resistant cell clone formation (Figures 2  and 4) , and resulted in the elimination of HCV replicons from treated cells (Figure 2c) . Importantly, we also demonstrated that these siRNAs, particularly si313, considerably limit HCV infection in cell culture. We did this using two HCV strains that can be propagated in Huh7-derived cells: (i) the JFH-1 strain of HCV genotype 2a, 4 and (ii) a chimeric derivative of JFH-1 carrying 5 NTR and core sequences of HCV genotype 1a (D. Delgrange, A. Pillez, L. Cocquerel, G. Paranhos-Baccala, Y. Rouill\u00e9, J. Dubuisson et al., unpublished results). Our data contrast with those obtained by others who concluded that domains II 17 and III 17, 19 of HCV 5 NTR are relatively resistant to siRNA, because there is reduced accessibility to these domains, given their association with different proteins and factors involved in translation. Our data indicate that regions involved in complex secondary and tertiary structures should not be disregarded as targets for RNAi. The data also underscore the importance of siRNA design. 25, 26 In contrast, two of the siRNAs tested in the present study (si214 and si284, targeting domains IIIc and IIIe, respectively) exhibited poor or only transient inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication (Figure 2a) . Interestingly, two other studies reported that siRNAs having sequences identical to that of si284 showed relative discrepancies in their effects in cells supporting autonomous replication of HCV subgenomic replicon. 13, 19 These conflicting results may be explained by the different strategies used for siRNA synthesis and/or delivery. In addition, the sensitivity of the replicon systems used may have an impact on the siRNA efficiencies reported. We observed some differences in siRNA efficiencies between: (i) transient replication systems in which viral target RNA and siRNA were co-introduced into cells (Figures 2 and 4) , and (ii) stable replication systems in which siRNA was introduced in cells supporting ongoing replication of the viral target, whether dealing with a subgenomic replicon (Figure 3 ) or genomelength infectious RNA (Figure 5, Table 2 ). Two micrograms of siRNA did not inhibit viral RNA replication in the stable subgenomic replicon system as efficiently as in cotransfection experiments (compare Figures 2 and 4) . In addition, si240-1a and si244 caused elimination of viral RNA upon cotransfection with subgenomic replicon (Figure 2a) , whereas they substantially reduced, but did not abolish the production of virus particles ( Figure 5, Table 2 ). This was in spite of the fact that the molar ratio of siRNA to targeted HCV RNA was higher in cells stably containing HCV replicons or infected with virus than in cells cotransfected with replicon and siRNA. In another study, high doses (4,000 pmol) of siRNAs proved necessary in order to strongly inhibit HCV RNA replication in subgenomic replicon-containing cells. 18 We speculate that viral RNA templates engaged in the replicase complex and nascent RNAs are probably not as accessible to the RNAi machinery as transfected viral RNAs are. Our data can also be explained in part by the fact that a proportion of cells in the culture were infected or supported ongoing viral RNA replication but did not receive siRNA, given that the efficiency of electroporation is ~70% in En5-3 and 2-3c cells (data not shown).",

When used with heterologous targets, the siRNAs si240-1a and si240-1b exhibited a noncanonical wobble base-pairing and a mismatch at the 3 end (position 18) of the siRNA antisense strand, respectively (Figure 1c) . For both 1a and 1b replicons, perfect base-pairing was preferred for maximum RNAi efficacy, but a G:U wobble and an A:C mismatch were both tolerated (Figure 4) . This is consistent with the fact that wobble base-pairing is known to be well tolerated in double-stranded RNA helices, providing stability similar to a Watson-Crick base-pairing. In agreement with our data, wobble base-pairs, especially when located at the 3 end of the siRNA antisense strand, were recently suggested to have no disruptive effect on RNAi. 28, 29, 33 More surprisingly, but also consistent with our data, it was reported that an A:C mismatch was not deleterious in double-stranded RNA structures. 29 Contrasting with these tolerated mismatches between siRNA and viral target RNA, we found that a C:A mismatch at the 5 end of the siRNA antisense strand strongly reduces the inhibitory effect of si244 on JFH-1 infection in cell culture ( Figure 5, Table 2) , and this is consistent with the RNAi mechanism. 29, 37 Taken together, these data provide strong evidence against the involvement of a spurious interferonmediated mechanism of inhibition in the suppression of viral replication we observed.",

This property allows RNA viruses to escape rapidly to a selective pressure such as antiviral treatments, when sequence changes are compatible with virus functions. This holds true for anti-protease and antipolymerase compounds that are currently under development for HCV treatment. 38, 39 However, we did not observe, after a single siRNA treatment, the emergence of escape mutations within siRNA-targeted genomic regions in RNA extracted from several G418-resistant cell clones. In other studies, siRNA-resistant viral mutants harboring single nucleotide substitutions or deletions within or at the vicinity of the siRNA-targeted sequence were reported to have emerged in cells expressing constitutively an shRNA (in the case of human immunodeficiency virus infections), 40, 41 and after repeated treatments with an siRNA targeting the polymerase coding sequence (in the case of HCV subgenomic replicons). 16 The lack of escape mutations observed in our study could either be due to the fact that a single siRNA was used in the treatment, or to the fact that siRNAs target highly conserved, functionally important genomic sequences, in which substitutions would not be compatible with translation/replication competence. Additional studies will be needed in order to determine which of these hypotheses holds true.",

            "text": "From the point of view of evaluating the potency of siRNAbased antiviral strategies to eradicate persistent infections, it was recently shown that siRNAs may be used to cure in vitro persistent infections caused by RNA viruses such as poliovirus or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. 30, 42 For assaying such a therapeutic strategy in animal models, synthetic siRNAs need to be further chemically stabilized and formulated to be efficiently delivered. Successful utilization of stabilized, lipid-encapsulated siRNAs was reported in a mouse model of hepatitis B virus replication. 43 In addition, organ or cell-type specific delivery of siRNAs has been achieved through siRNA binding to cholesterol 44 or to antibodies directed against cell surface antigens. 45 Synthetic shRNAs also showed a more prolonged inhibitory effect in murine liver than siRNAs did. This was demonstrated upon co-delivery of shRNA or siRNA targeting domain IV of the HCV IRES and plasmid DNA encoding a reporter protein placed under the translational control of the HCV IRES. 46 Alternatively, optimization of siRNA delivery may rely on the use of viral vectors that allow continuous synthesis of shRNAs in cells, thereby leading to sustained RNAi. 31, 47 It is crucial, however, to control intracellular shRNA production levels, since it has recently been reported that constant, high expression of shRNAs in the liver could be lethal in mouse models. 48 Nevertherless, controlled doses of siRNA or expression of shRNA have already been shown to be efficient and safe in several animal models of viral infection, including in a mouse model of hepatitis B virus infection, 47 a rhesus macaque model of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection, 49 and mouse models of West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus infections. 31 In the present study, we have identified promising anti-HCV siRNAs (si313 and, to a lesser extent, si244 and si240) that target highly conserved sequences in domain III of the 5 NTR and efficiently silence HCV infection in cell culture. It has now become possible to monitor the effect of these siRNAs in vivo using a tamarin/marmoset primate model of infection with a chimeric GB virus B-containing HCV domain III of the HCV IRES, that we have previously described. 8 During revision of this manuscript, Kanda et al. 50 reported that delivery of an HCV 5 NTR-specific shRNA to hepatoma cell lines infected by HCV resulted in the reduction of viral production.",

Delgrange, A. Pillez, L. Cocquerel, G. Paranhos-Baccala, Y. Rouill\u00e9, J. Dubuisson et al., will be described elsewhere).

Two dicistronic, subgenomic HCV replicons that encode a selectable reporter gene, neomycine phosphotransferase (Neo) were used in this study (see Figure 1 ). These replicon cDNAs, kindly provided by S.M. Lemon, are inserted downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and have been previously described as pNNeo/3-5B 20 and pNtat2Aneo. 21 We will refer to these replicons as NNeo and Ntat2ANeo, respectively, in this study. NNeo and Ntat2ANeo each carries a cell culture adaptive mutation, R2889G and S2005I, respectively. Both replicon cDNAs are derived from the cDNA of the N strain of genotype 1b HCV with the exception of the 5 NTR sequence of the Ntat2ANeo, which is derived from the H77 strain of HCV genotype 1a. Ntat2ANeo RNA encodes human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein fused to the 2A protease of foot-and-mouth disease virus, followed by Neo. 21 Upon transfection of En5-3 cells with Ntat2ANeo replicon, the expression of Tat-2A drives the synthesis of secreted SEAP. 21 cDNAs bearing a 30-nucleotide deletion, including the three codons (GDD) of the active site of the RNA polymerase NS5B within the backbone of NNeo and Ntat2ANeo, 20, 21 and referred to as \u0394GDD, were used as replicationdeficient RNAs. Plasmid DNAs were linearized with XbaI prior to in vitro transcription using MEGAscript T7 kit. The DNA template was removed by treatment with TURBO DNase (Ambion, Courtaboeuf, France) and RNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. The quality and quantity of replicon RNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing 0.8% agarose gel and by optical density measurements.",

The three siRNA sequences are homologous to the 5 NTR of this chimeric virus. In order to monitor the inhibitory effect of siRNAs on HCV infection, HuAP cells were electroporated with each siRNA and infected with either JFH-1 or the chimeric 1a/2a virus JFH-1/C(+)6-1a. Infected cells were probed by immunofluorescence with anti-core (Figure 5a) or anti-E2 (data not shown) monoclonal antibodies. Most cells in the control cultures infected with JFH-1/C(+)6-1a (Figure 5a, left panel) or JFH-1 (Figure 5a, right panel) were antigen-positive. Non-specific siIRR had no detectable effect on HCV infection",

One fifth of the cDNA was used for programming PCRs with either HCV-specific primers that allowed amplification of a fragment spanning nucleotides 3457-5085 of the N strain of HCV genotype 1b, or primers specific to cellular housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, so as to normalize for total RNA content. PCRs were performed using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) under the following cycling conditions: 1 cycle at 94 \u00b0C for 3 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of: (i) 30 seconds at 94 \u00b0C; (ii) 30 seconds at 55 \u00b0C; and (iii) 1.5 minutes at 72 \u00b0C.
