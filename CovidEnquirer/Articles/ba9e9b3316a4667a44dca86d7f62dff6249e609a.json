In the past decades, much consideration focused on the nutrition and reproduction of captive giant pandas, while prevention and control of infectious diseases were ignored. The impact of infectious disease on wildlife populations has been documented in a variety of wildlife species and has highlighted the need to consider infectious disease in conservation plans (Dobson and Foufopoulos, 2001) .",

Under these circumstances, it can not be avoided that pathogens could transmit among species and individuals including giant pandas, and that visitors can also transmit pathogens to animals. Although dogs and cats are not allowed to enter the place where giant pandas live, breeders or visitors who have pets probably transmit pathogens to pandas. Veterinary Microbiology 142 (2010) Serum samples from 92 giant pandas in three captive facilities were tested for antibodies against five viruses of carnivores. Antibody titers against canine distemper virus (CDV) in two facilities in which giant pandas were vaccinated were variable. The canine adenovirus (CAV-1) and canine parvovirus (CPV) titers in vaccinated group were both positive, but titers were not high and varied among individual except one vaccinated panda had extremely high CAV-1 titer, indicating infection with the field virus following vaccination. Our results suggest that the vaccines used for these giant pandas do not elicit consistent antibody titers. Antibody titers against CDV, CPV and CAV-1 in unvaccinated giant pandas were highly variable, especially CPV titer. Almost half of sera were CPV antibody positive, and CPV titers were high enough to suggest infection with the virus. Canine coronavirus (CCV) and canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) titers were not detected in all serum samples. The results of this study emphasize the need for research on infectious diseases of giant pandas and development of suitable vaccines for the species.",

For instance, three pandas were infected with CDV, of which two died in Chongqing Zoo, and two pandas died of CDV in Nanjing Zoo (Hu et al., 1997; Huang, 1983) . Giant pandas with CPV infection showed diarrhea, vomiting and water-like feces (Wu et al., 1988) , and CCV caused acute enteritis of pandas in Fuzhou Zoo in 1987. CDV and CCV strains were also isolated from giant pandas (Li et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2004) . Mainka et al. (1994) assayed antibody titers against CDV, CCV, canine herpesvirus (CHV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2), and CPV in sera from eight unvaccinated pandas, and detected antibodies against CDV, CCV, CAV-2 and CPV. Loeffler et al. (2007) (Janssen et al., 2006) . Vaccination of cubs with modified live CDV vaccines may contribute to the gastrointestinal and respiratory illness. What's more, the dental abnormalities and enamel erosion that are found in giant pandas may be related to early infection with CDV (Bittegeko et al., 1995; Janssen et al., 2006) .",

Blood samples were collected when pandas were anesthetized for semen collection, artificial insemination or routine physical examination during February to June. Both the CPB and BJZ had vaccinated their pandas 4-5 months prior to blood sample collection. Pandas were anesthetized with keta-mine hydrochloride (5-10 mg/kg body weight; The First Pharmacy Co., Shanghai, China) by staff veterinarians. CPB had vaccinated their giant pandas with a Chinese manufactured multivalent vaccine against CDV, CPV, CAV-1, CCV, canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) and rabies virus for dogs. All but the rabies component of the vaccine were modified live viruses; and the rabies virus was killed with formalin. BJZ had vaccinated with an inactivated CDV vaccine. The strain, dose, and concentration of virus in the vaccines were unknown, or at least unobtainable. One giant panda called Dadi was born in WL, and then transferred to BJZ in October, 2004 and was vaccinated with inactive CDV vaccine. We collected a serum sample from Dadi while he was at WL in April 2004 and then at BJZ in March 2005. Serum samples were stored at \u00c020 8C until analysis.",

Serum dilutions began at 1:8 and are reported as the last dilution at which no cytopathic effect was observed in indicator cells. Antibody titers against CPV-2 and CPIV were measured by hemagglutination inhibition with the use of porcine red blood cells and chicken red blood cells, respectively, starting with serum dilutions of 1:10. Hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed according to the method described by Carmichael et al. (1980) . Results are reported as the highest dilution at which no hemagglutination was observed.

Neonates and cubs are prone to diarrhae, which is common in captive giant pandas and is associated with high mortality (Loeffler et al., 2006) .

Titers against CDV ranged from negative (12/25) to suspect (6/25) to positive (7/25), and Dadi did not produce high positive antibody titer (1:8) after vaccination. This suggests that the vaccines used for these animals do not elicit consistent antibody titers. Wang et al. (2008) surveyed the antibody of the canine distemper attenuated live vaccines on 33 giant pandas, and found that the attenuated vaccine was inadequate to stimulate giant pandas to produce high level of antibody against CDV. Based on these observations, and on the widely understood risk of using vaccines in untested exotic species, we suggest that the modified-live and killed canine vaccines are not appropriate for use in giant pandas. Vaccinated giant pandas carried a high prevalence of positive CPV titers. This is consistent with the findings of Loeffler et al. (2007) , who demonstrated that 91% of giant pandas vaccinated with canine vaccine had positive CPV titers. Both studies show high degree of variation in the CPV titers in vaccinated giant pandas. Clearly, the magnitude and distribution of the values in the CPV vaccinated giant pandas in this study did not meet the expectations with an effective vaccine.",

As well, the vaccine produces highly variable titers in the two species. The high variability of the vaccine response among individuals suggests that the quality of the vaccine may be inconsistent. Alternative explanations to the viable vaccine titers include inconsistent delivery of the vaccine or variability in response of the giant panda individual to antigens. In China, few trials are conducted to evaluate the effect and safety of vaccine in wildlife; most of experiences were from dogs.

This suggested that CCV and CPIV infections were not prevalent in the study populations or the assays were not sensitive with the panda sera. Another explanation was that the virus strains or their preparation for the vaccine are not appropriate for the immunization of pandas.",

In China, however, there is no standard vaccine strategy for captive giant pandas. For example, most giant pandas at China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda (Wolong Research Center, WL) are not vaccinated, while the CPB used live multivalent vaccines (including CDV, CPV, CAV-1, CCV, Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), and rabies virus) for dogs, and the Beijing Zoo (BJZ) used killed CDV vaccine made for dogs. Although no giant panda deaths have been directly attributable to attenuated live virus vaccines in China, the possibility of subclinical disease may be significant.
