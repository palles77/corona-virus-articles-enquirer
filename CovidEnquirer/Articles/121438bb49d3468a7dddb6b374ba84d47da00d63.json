We aimed to investigate the nuclear complement of these neural systems in comparison to those of simian primates, megachiropterans and other mammalian species. The brains were coronally sectioned and immunohistochemically stained with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin and orexin-A. The nuclei identified were identical among the strepsirrhine species investigated and identical to previous reports in simian primates. Moreover, a general similarity to other mammals was found, but specific differences in the nuclear complement highlighted potential phylogenetic interrelationships.

            "text": "Extant Primates are currently split into Strepsirrhini (Lemuriformes) and Haplorhini (Anthropoidea and Tarsius), with Strepsirrhini being the earliest distinct branch of the extant primates (Kay et al., 1997a,b; Bloch et al., 1997; Ni et al., 2013) . Genomic data suggest that the estimated time of the most recent common ancestor of Strepsirrhinin and Haplorhini ranged between 58.9 and 68.6 million years (Jameson et al., 2011) . Strepsirrhines and, among the haplorhines, the Tarsiidae whose unique extant representative are the tarsiers, appear to have retained several plesiomorphic features of stem primates (Matsui et al., 2009; Rosa et al., 1996) . This includes the Dermoptera (colugos or flying lemurs), which have recently been identified as a primate sister taxon that diverged very early at $86 million years ago (e.g. Arnason et al., 2002) . For this reason the organization of the various neural systems within the strepsirrhine brain is of interest in understanding the phylogenetic trajectory of primates as a group. To date, no comprehensive mapping of the nuclei of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic or orexinergic systems has been undertaken for any strepsirrhine primate, but data for anthropoid primates such as the pygmy marmoset and the common marmosets, the squirrel monkey, the macaque monkey, the baboon and the human are available (summarized in Dell et al., 2010) . In this sense, there is a gap in our knowledge of the evolution of the nuclear organization of these systems between primates and other mammals.",

This hypothesis proposes that megachiropterans and microchiropterans are two evolutionarily distinct mammalian groups not related to each other in the same monophyletic order. Instead, the megachiropterans are proposed to have evolved from the dermopteran lineage of gliders (also known as the colugos or ''flying lemurs''), which are the acknowledged sister group to primates (Pettigrew, 1986; Pettigrew et al., 1989; Meredith et al., 2011) . The ''Flying Primate'' hypothesis is contentious because of DNA sequence data that appears to refute it, but which may reflect convergent DNA evolution under the selection pressure of high temperature associated with powered flight (Pettigrew and Kirsch, 1995, 1998; Kirsh and Pettigrew, 1998; Hutcheon et al., 1998; Jabbari and Bernadri, 2004) . Nevertheless, there is substantial data coming from brain studies that supports this hypothesis (Pettigrew, 1986; Pettigrew et al., 1989 Pettigrew et al., , 2008 Manger et al., 2001; Kruger et al., 2010a,b; Dell et al., 2010 Dell et al., , 2013 .",

            "text": "Changes in the complexity of neural system structure, in terms of the number and complement of distinct subdivisions, are thought to occur only during the evolutionary events leading to the establishment of a new mammalian order (Manger, 2005) . All progeny of the newly established order will then likely retain the same complement of distinct subdivisions of the various systems irrespective of the subsequently evolution of brain size, phenotype or life history parameters (Manger, 2005) . While there are some cases that do not adhere directly to this hypothesis, for example the organization of the locus coeruleus in murid rodents is different from all other rodent groups (Kruger et al., 2012) , this framework for understanding changes in mammalian brain evolution at the systems level has been supported by a number of studies (see summaries in Dell et al., 2010; Calvey et al., 2013) . Given this background, the current study aimed to analyse the nuclear organization of the cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic systems in three previously unstudied strepsirrhine primate species. This was done for two reasons: (1) to determine whether the strepsirrhine and haplorhine primates share an identical complement of nuclei for these systems, providing a primate specific nuclear complement of these systems (Manger, 2005) ; and (2) to determine whether this potentially primate specific complement of nuclei shares enough similarities with the nuclear complement of the same systems found in megachiropterans Dell et al., 2010) to provide a further test of the ''Flying Primate'' hypothesis using neuroanatomical data.",

Permits were obtained from the relevant wildlife authority in the Democratic Republic of Congo for G. demidoff and P. potto, as well as from the Copenhagen Zoo for L. catta. All animals were handled according to the guidelines of the University of the Witwatersrand Animal Ethics Committee. Each animal was weighed, anaesthetized and subsequently euthanized with appropriate doses of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg sodium pentobarbital/kg). Upon cessation of respiration the animals were perfused intracardially with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), approximately 1 l/kg of each solution, both solutions having a temperature of approximately 4 8C. The brains were then carefully removed from the skulls and post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB, followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB at 4 8C. Each brain was then frozen in crushed dry ice and sectioned into 50 mm thick serial coronal sections on a freezing microtome. A one in six series of sections, cut at 50 mm thickness in the coronal plane, was made for Nissl substance, myelin, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), serotonin (5HT) and orexin-A (hypocretin/OxA) staining. Sections used for the Nissl series were mounted on 0.5% gelatine-coated glass slides, cleared in a solution of 1:1 chloroform and absolute alcohol, then stained in 1% cresyl violet to reveal cell bodies. Myelin sections were first stored in 5% formalin for two weeks at 4 8C then mounted on 1.5% packed core (A6c) of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive neurons was surrounded by a shell of less densely packed (A6d) tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive neurons. This combination of compact and diffuse divisions of the locus coeruleus complex is only found in primates and megachiropterans of all the mammalian species studied to date. This neural character, along with variances in a range of other neural characters, supports the phylogenetic grouping of primates with megachiropterans as a sister group.",

For the immunohistochemical staining, each section was treated with endogenous peroxidase inhibitor (49.2% methanol:49.2% 0.1 M PB: 1.6% of 30% H 2 O 2 ) for 30 min and subsequently subjected to three 10 min 0.1 M PB rinses. Sections were then preincubated for 2 h, at room temperature, in blocking buffer (containing 3% normal goat serum for the TH, 5-HT and OxA sections or 3% normal rabbit serum for the ChAT sections, plus 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Triton-X in 0.1 M PB). This was followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB. The sections were then placed in the primary antibody solution that contained the appropriate diluted primary antibody in blocking buffer for 48 h at 4 8C under gentle agitation. Anti-choline acetyltransferase (AB144P, Millipore, raised in goat) at a dilution of 1:3000 was used to reveal cholinergic neurons. Anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (AB151, Millipore, raised in rabbit) at a dilution of 1:7500 revealed the catecholaminergic neurons. Serotonergic neurons were revealed using anti-serotonin (AB938, Millipore, raised in rabbit) at a dilution of 1:7500. Orexinergic neurons were revealed using anti-Orexin A (AB3704, Millipore, raised in rabbit) at a dilution of 1:3000. This incubation was followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB and the sections were then incubated in a secondary antibody solution (1:1000 dilution of biotinylated antirabbit IgG, BA-1000, Vector Labs, for TH, 5-HT and OxA sections, or a 1:1000 dilution of biotinylated anti-goat IgG, BA-5000, Vector Labs, for ChAT sections, in a blocking buffer containing 3% NGS/NRS and 2% BSA in 0.1 M PB) for 2 h at room temperature. This was followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB, after which sections were incubated for 1 h in avidin-biotin solution (at a dilution of 1:125, Vector Labs), followed by three 10 min rinses in 0.1 M PB. Sections were then placed in a solution of 0.05% diaminobenzidine (DAB) in 0.1 M PB for 5 min, followed by the addition of 3 ml of 3% hydrogen peroxide to each 1 ml of solution in which each section was immersed. Chromatic precipitation was visually monitored and verified under a low power stereomicroscope. Staining was continued until such time as the background stain was at a level that would assist architectural reconstruction without obscuring the immunopositive neurons. Development was arrested by placing sections in 0.1 M PB, followed by two more rinses in this solution. Sections were then mounted on 0.5% gelatine coated glass slides, dried overnight, dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols, cleared in xylene and coverslipped with Depex. To test for non-specific staining, the primary antibody or the secondary antibody was omitted in selected section, which resulted in no staining of the tissue.",

For the most part, the systems investigated exhibited an organization that may be thought of as generally mammalian, and typically primate-like; however, the structure of the locus coeruleus in the primates appears to be quite different to that observed in most other mammals, although it is very similar to that seen in megachiropteran bats Dell et al., 2010) . As all species investigated showed a near identical pattern of nuclear organization, the following description applies to all three species unless otherwise noted. Despite this it should be noted that hile the nuclear subdivisions of these systems are the same across the species, the exact morphology of the brains of the different species does differ to some extent, and these minor differences lead to slightly different placement of the nuclei of the systems investigated in relation to the broader neuroanatomy.",

For the most part, the organization and complement of nuclei of these systems were similar to that observed in many other Eutherian mammals previously described (e.g. Dell et al., 2010) , but despite this there were specific differences of note (summarized in Table 1 ) that may be related either to the phylogenetic history or to the current life histories of these species. The locus coeruleus complex, presenting with both a compact (A6c) and a diffuse (A6d) portion was present in all three strepsirrhine species studied, which is the same as previously observed in haplorhine primates and in megachiropterans Dell et al., 2010) . In microchiropterans, as in most other mammals, only the A6d portion of the locus coeruleus is present Kruger et al., 2010a) . All three strepsirrhines had a large and clearly expressed lateral division of the dorsal raphe, a typical primate feature that has been described in megachiropterans (Dell et al., 2010) . All three strepsirrhines had the catecholaminergic A4 and A15d nuclei, as well as the optic tract cluster (Otc) of the orexinergic system. These nuclei are present in all previously studied megachiropterans, but are absent in all previously studied microchiropterans Kruger et al., 2010a,b) . The cholinergic parabigeminal nucleus was present in these strepsirrhines as well as in megachiropterans, whereas this nucleus is absent in four out of the six previously studied microchiropterans Kruger et al., 2010a) . There was a clear presence of the catecholaminergic ventral division of the substantia nigra nuclear complex in all three strepsirrhine species, but this nucleus appears to be incipient in microchiropterans and is completely absent in one species Kruger et al., 2010a) . Overall, the results of the current study, along with those from previous studies support chiropteran diphyly and the link between megachiropterans and primates.",

While there can be significant variation in the complement of cholinergic nuclei in the mammalian brain, it can be said that the complement of cholinergic nuclei in strepsirrhine primates likely reflects that of a generalized Eutherian mammal. In the strepsirrhine primates no cholinergic interneurons were observed in the cerebral cortex, as observed in Murid rodents and the hottentot golden mole (e.g. Bhagwandin et al., 2006; Calvey et al., 2013) , or in other regions of the brain such as the olfactory bulb, amygdala, hippocampus, superior and inferior colliculi, or cochlear nuclei as seen in some Afrotherians (Pieters et al., 2010; Calvey et al., 2013) . As with most other mammals, the parabigeminal nucleus was present in all three strepsirrhines, but as mentioned, this nucleus was not found in four species of microchiropterans Kruger et al., 2010a) . In addition, the strepsirrhine primates did not exhibit parvocellular cholinergic neurons surrounding the pontine cholinergic nuclei (LDT and PPT) as observed in the rock hyrax (Gravett et al., 2009) . Thus, the variance in the complement of cholinergic nuclei does, to an extent, distinguish the primates from several other mammalian lineages, but does not specifically align them with the megachiropterans; however, it does not argue against such an alignment, and the complement of cholinergic nuclei does serve to distinguish the megachiropterans from the microchiropterans.",

            "text": "For the most part, the complement of nuclei identified as belonging to the catecholaminergic system in the strepsirrhines studied was similar to that observed in most eutherian mammals Table 1 Summary of the nuclei delineated in the current study of strepsirrhine primates in comparison to similar studies previously undertaken in microchiropterans, megachiropterans and haplorhine primates (data for these species from Dell et al., 2010) . Cells with a dark grey background indicate features distinguishing the microchiroptera from the other species. Cells with a light grey background indicate features that align the megachiropterans with the primates to the exclusion of all other mammals. (Dell et al., 2010; Calvey et al., 2013) ; however, one feature of the catecholaminergic system, the presence of the locus coeruleus compact division (A6c) specifically aligns the primates with the megachiropterans to the exclusion of all other mammals, including the microchiropterans Kruger et al., 2010a) . Thus, in primates and megachiropterans, the locus coeruleus has a distinct core (which we term A6c) region of densely packed tyrosine hyodroxylase immunoreactive neurons, surrounded by a shell of less densely packed neurons (which we term A6d). In most other mammals, the core region (A6c) is absent, and the neurons of the locus coeruleus are less densely packed (e.g. Dell et al., 2010; Calvey et al., 2013) . The one group of possible exceptions to this distinguishing and aligning feature of primates and megachiropterans are the murid rodents. In murid rodents, the A6 region is seen as a very densely packed core of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons (Dahlstr\u00f6 m and Fuxe, 1964; Kruger et al., 2012) ; however, in all other rodents previously studied, including bathyergid mole rats, the greater cane rat, the African porcupine and the Highveld gerbil (Da Silva et al., 2006; Moon et al., 2007; Dwarika et al., 2008; Bhagwandin et al., 2008; Limacher et al., 2008) , the A6 region presents as a more loosely packed cluster of tyrosine immunoreactive neurons and has been classified as the diffuse portion of the locus coeruleus complex (A6d). It is therefore likely that the compact appearance of the locus coeruleus in murid rodents is not a feature shared with primates and megachiropterans (and therefore lost in all other rodent species) and is an apomorphy specific to the murid rodents (Kruger et al., 2012) . The cholinergic cortical neurons are a second murid rodent specific feature of the systems investigated (Bhagwandin et al., 2006; Kruger et al., 2012) . In this sense, the compact locus coeruleus and the cortical cholinergic interneurons are likely to have evolved specifically within the murid rodent lineage, and do not affect the concluded alignment of the megachiropterans with the primates to the exclusion of all other mammals. The appearance of the compact portion of the locus coeruleus is a specific character creating the exclusive megachiropteran-primate phylogenetic link, although it might be argued that this character could have evolved in parallel in both lineages. Studies of other Euarchontoglires, such as hares and rabbits, tree shrews and the colugos (or flying lemurs) will determine whether this feature evolved independently in the megachiropteran and primate lineages, or whether it was inherited from a common megachiropteran-primate ancestor. The locus coeruleus is the main site for noradrenalin production in the brain and is involved in alterness/ arousal as well as in the optimization of task performance and consolidation of long-term memories (Smeets and Gonz\u00e1 lez, 2000; Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005) . To our knowledge, there are no specific behavioural or neural processing differences in the megachiropterans and primates compared to other mammals that would explain the presence of this exceptional arrangement of the locus coeruleus, but future studies may reveal differences related to this neural specialization. In addition to the presence of the A6c in the megachiropterans and primates, the absence of the A4 nucleus, the incipient nature of the A9v and the absence of the A15d nucleus in microchiropterans Kruger et al., 2010a) , serve to distinguish the microchiropterans from both the megachiropterans and primates, and aligns them with the Soricidae. Thus, the variance in the nuclear complement of the catecholaminergic system strongly supports the hypothesis of chiropteran diphyly, and moreover, supports both the megachiropteran-primate and the microchiropteran-Soricidae phylogenetic relationships.",

Variances in the nuclear complement of the serotonergic system have been observed in monotremes and marsupials, with the presence of hypothalamic serotonergic neurons, the lack of the caudal division of the dorsal raphe nuclear complex in the monotremes (Manger et al., 2002c) , and the absence of the caudal ventrolateral serotonergic group in marsupials (Patzke et al., 2014) . Although the three strepsirrhines possessed all serotonergic nuclei common to primates, and indeed all Eutherian mammals studied to date (Dell et al., 2010; Maseko et al., 2013; Calvey et al., 2013) , the presence of a relatively large and clearly expressed lateral division of the dorsal raphe, a feature common to previously studied haplorhines as well as megachiropterans (Dell et al., 2010) may have some functional effect on the inhibition of REM sleep (Monti, 2011) . Thus, the qualitative enlargement of a single nucleus of the serotonergic system appears to align the megachiropterans with the primates. This is a tenuous link that needs to be investigated in more detail, perhaps using quantitative stereological and allometric approaches.",

The one main exception of relevance to the problem of chiropteran phylogeny is the absence of the optic tract cluster of orexinergic neurons in the microchiropterans (Kruger et al., 2010b) . This feature distinguishes the microchiropterans from all other mammals, including megachiropterans (Dell et al., 2013) and supports the hypothesis of chiropteran diphyly. It is presently unclear what specific functional implications the lack of these orexinergic neurons may have on the microchiropterans.",

Thus, as proposed previously (Manger, 2005) , there is a distinct primate order organization of the nuclei belonging these systems. While for the most part these nuclei are commonly found across many mammals (Dell et al., 2010; Calvey et al., 2013) , the only species that share with primates the same full complement of nuclei are the megachiropterans. Of the 73 neural characters identified in strepsirrhine and haplorhine primates and in megachiropterans, only one specific feature links these species to the exclusion of all other mammals (although 5 characters distinguish the microchiropterans from the megachiropterans, see Table 1 ). When this neural characteristic (the presence of a compact portion of the locus coeruleus complex, A6c) is added to the extensive suite of neural features listed by Pettigrew et al. (1989) that links the megachiropterans to primates to the exclusion of the microchiropterans, as well as to the nonneural features supporting the megachiropteran-primate phylogenetic link, the data in favour of chiropteran diphyly and the relationship between megachiropterans and primates becomes well supported. There is also a sense in which the present data linking megachiropterans to primates are complementary, rather than mere additions. Martin (1986) dismissed this phylogenetic link by proposing convergent evolution of the midbrain visual trait, with independent evolution of this trait in both primates and megachiropterans under selection for visually directed behaviour in the ''fine branch niche''. Whatever one thinks about the possibility of a megachiropteran manipulating such a niche, the present findings of completely non-visual features that link megachiropterans to primates refutes Martin's proposal of convergent evolution and broadens the conceptual basis of the ''flying primate'' hypothesis. While clearly more work is required to substantiate this proposed phylogenetic assignation, when considering the data that have been generated so far, the megachiropteran-primate link appears to be more parsimonious than chiropteran monophyly.",

            "text": "The extensive similarities of the neuromodulatory systems of megachiropterans and primates may be of importance for the translation of studies of animal models to the study of human mental function and dysfunction and human health in general. As a specific example, the locus coeruleus complex is of interest. Murid rodents, the most commonly used mammalian animal model , have what is likely to be an independently evolved structure of the locus coeruleus, while that of the megachiropterans and primates is more likely to be the result of a shared ancestry. The locus coeruleus complex is involved in many important neural functions, and the possibility that the compact and diffuse divisions of this complex are features specific and unique to the megachiropterans and primates, to the exclusion of rodents and all other mammals, cannot be ignored. The locus coeruleus optimizes task performance by incorporating cortical mechanisms involved in the evaluation of costs and benefits associated with task performance (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005) . It also plays a very important role in mediating the sleep/wake cycle and may in fact be a primary factor that differentiates REM sleep from wakefulness (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005) . This has important implications for human mental health, considering the well-known link between sleep disturbances and psychiatric disorders. For example, 80-90% of people suffering from depression have impaired sleep quality with insomnia increasing the risk for depression, anxiety and substance abuse (Smith and Aston-Jones, 2008) . The severity of sleep disturbances correlates with the severity of the psychiatric disorder (Smith and Aston-Jones, 2008) . In depression and mania, there is a total increase in the percentage of REM sleep as a function of total sleep time, and it is suggested that REM sleep is disinhibited in depression, narcolepsy and schizophrenia (Smith and Aston-Jones, 2008) . The locus coeruleus complex plays a major role in mediating sleep cycles (Siegel, 2004) . It is therefore likely that a megachiropteran would provide a more realistic animal model for the translation of relevant psychiatric testing to human when compared to the popular rat model. In addition, there is quite a gap between the visual organization of the primate brain and that of all other mammals, except megachiropterans. Understanding that phylogenetic gap, which includes complex thalamic lamination and new cortical areas, as well as the hemidecussated retinotectal pathway, requires a closer intermediate than a rodent, tree shrew or carnivore, a role that could be fulfilled by a megachiropteran sister to primates. In addition, both megachiropteran and microchiropteran bats can carry, with apparent impunity, a large number of viruses that are lethal to humans, such as Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Both kinds of chiropterans appear to have independently evolved more elaborate and more complex immune systems to deal with the increased cellular damage brought about by the load of reactive oxygen species that accompanies powered flight (Zhang et al., 2013) . A consequence of the increased immunity may be impunity to many viruses. These observations are relevant to the conclusion that the two kinds of bats have separate, independent lineages, as the cellular and molecular mechanisms that provide the increased power and scope of their immune systems are also different in the way that they produce this outcome in the two kinds of bats (Zhang et al., 2013) . Understanding how the chiropteran immune systems enable them to evade these viruses therefore involves an understanding of how the different megachiropteran and microchiropteran immune systems have each evolved to produce an independent but more powerful outcome in each case. While at this stage, the applicability of the megachiropterans as improved animal models of specific human mental functions and dysfunctions and general human health over murid rodents is still speculative, the data being generated in this and other comparative neurological studies, indicate that the megachiropterans might be a fruitful animal model to be employed in future studies of human mental dysfunction, general health and primate brain evolution. For these, and many other reasons, understanding chiropteran phylogeny is of more than just scientific interest.",
