From 26 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, sera were collected at the time of sudden increase in otorrhea and three to four weeks later. These paired sera were examined for antibody titer to respiratory viruses (21 species) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Of them, influenza B virus and RSV infections were demonstrated in four and two cases, respectively. Examinations showed no infection in 10 control cases without acute exacerbation. In 36 cases of acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, attempts were made to isolate viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae from the pharynx and otorrhea. Consequently, influenza B virus was detected in pharyngeal mucous scrapings in two cases and RSV in one. The probability of respiratory virus infection leading to acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media appears to be lower than that provoking acute otitis media in children and infants. However, the present data suggest that the development of respiratory virus infection in patients with chronic otitis media may cause an increase in the otorrhea, eventually resulting in an acute exacerbation of inflammation.",

At this laboratory, small aliquots of each medium were inoculated without delay into tubes of MA104, WI38, Vero and Hep-2. All cell cultures (HEK, MK, MA104, WI38, Vero and Hep-2) were incubated at 33\u00b0C on a roller drum and examined every day for the cytopathic effect (CPE). The virus multiplication was confirmed by CPE and haemadsorption. Haemadsorption, using guinea pig erythrocytes incubated at 4\u00b0C for 20 min and at room temperature for an hour, was performed on all cell cultures before passaging into fresh cells. Cultures were considered to be negative when there was no evidence for CPE and for haemadsorption after three blind passages.",

It is not justifiable to discuss acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media and acute otitis media on an equal level. It is presumable, however, that respiratory virus infection has an adverse effect on the pathological condition of the middle ear in our cases of chronic otitis media as reported with acute otitis media. KLEIN and TEELE (1976) reviewed ten reports of case of acute otitis media complicated with virus or Mycoplasma infection of the upper respiratory system, and found that out of 249 cases examined for antibodies in paired sera, 72 cases (28.9 %) were suspected of respiratory virus infection and 15 of 164 cases (9.1 %) had Mycoplasma. It was further found that viruses were isolated from the nasopharynx or throat in 59 of 249 cases (23.7%) and from the middle ear effusion in 29 of 663 cases (4.4 %), and that Mycoplasma was isolated from the nasopharynx or throat in 5 of 116 cases (4.3 %) and from the middle ear effusion in I of 721 cases (0.13 %). BLAHOVA et al. (1980) reported that out of 126 children with acute otitis media, 60 patients (47.8 %) had a respiratory virus infection and viruses were isolated from the nasopharynx in 25 patients and from the middle ear in 5. From 50 cases with secretory otitis media, ADLINGTON and HOOPER (1980) isolated respiratory viruses from the pharynx and nasopharynx of four (8 %), but none from the middle ear mucosa. CARLSEN and 0RSTAVIK (1980) stated that, of 422 children diagnosed as RSV infection, 76 had complication with otitis media. The low incidence reported hitherto may be ascribed at least in part to the failure in examining for some pathogens probably affecting the respiratory system, such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, etc. HENDERSON et al. (1982) disclosed two factors influencing the occurrence of acute otitis media with effusion (OME), namely viral respiratory infection and nasopharyngeal colonization with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus injluenzae, and concluded that respiratory infection with RSV, influenza A or B and adenovirus conferred a greater risk ofOME than nasopharyngeal colonization with the bacteria mentioned above. These findings attest the association between respiratory virus infection and otitis media and suggest that some patients with acute otitis media harbor viruses in their upper respiratory tract, but rarely in the middle ear. Although the frequency of respiratory virus infection differed among investigators, many of them postulated the significance of respiratory viruses in the etiology of acute otitis media.",

            "text": "In the present study, respiratory virus infection was not included in cases of chronic otitis media without exacerbation, but it was demonstrated in some cases of acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media. The ratio of these cases to the total cases examined was lower than that reported in acute otitis media. It is conceivable that acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media may occur following respiratory virus infection by the same mechanism involved in acute otitis media. GIEBINK, BERZINS, MARKER, and SCHIFFMAN (1980) reported that acute otitis media was hardly induced in experimental animals by exposing them to viruses through the nasal cavity but those exposed to both viruses and bacteria were vulnerable to inflammatory disease. This may be explained as follows: the function of Eustachian tube is disordered due to virus infection (STUART-HARRIS and SCHILD, 1976) and the bacteria present in the nasal cavity easily get into the middle ear cavity. In addition, the virus infection weakens the defensive power of the lesion (HAMILTON, OVERALL, and GLASGOW, 1976; JAKAB and GREEN, 1976; WARSHAUER, GOLDSTEIN, AKERS, LIPPERT, and KIM, 1977; GARDNER, 1980) , creating an environment suitable for bacterial infection. GIEBINK et al. (1980) stated further that virus isolation from the middle ear was difficult in experimental otitis media, probably because the viruses, having entered the middle ear, disappeared in an early stage before middle ear effusion was produced. MEURMAN et al. (1980) reported that antibodies to respiratory viruses were detected in middle ear and nasopharyngeal secretions from child patients with secretory otitis media, and that the titers of middle ear secretions were generally higher than those of nasopharyngeal secretions. They alluded local production of specific antibodies in the middle ear.",

If a patient with chronic otitis media has respiratory virus infection, the middle ear may be affected by acute inflammation induced by the bacteria through the processes mentioned above. In fact, the same bacteria were isolated from the pharynx and otorrhea in many cases of acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media and in all cases having virus infection in this study. Chronic otitis media may be exacerbated in a similar way as in Mycoplasma infection. However, the incidence of such infection is much lower than that of virus infection. Furthermore, Mycoplasma infection usually prevails in only a limited district. Naturally, cases of Mycoplasma infection are very few. In such circumstances, data so far obtained varied widely among authors.",

It is possibly considered that chronic otitis media can be acutely exacerbated by a certain factor (s) other than respiratory virus infection. However, the present data suggest that the development of respiratory virus infection in patients with chronic ,otitis media may in-crease otorrhea, eventually resulting in an acute exacerbation of inflammation. More specifically, respiratory virus infection may have played some etiological role in 6 of 26 cases of chronic otitis media with acute exacerbation accompanying increased otorrhea. Presumably, however, the probability of respiratory virus infection suddently worsening the inflammatory condition of the middle ear in chronic otitis media will be higher than 6/26. In any case, it is of vital importance to take necessary measures for the protection of patients with chronic otitis media against common cold in preoperative as well as postoperative stages.",
