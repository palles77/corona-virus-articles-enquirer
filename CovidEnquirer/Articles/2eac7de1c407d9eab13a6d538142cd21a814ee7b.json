Currently, incubation period and transmissibility are questions of global concern, but difficult to answer given nonspecific and mild symptoms that could represent a variety of respiratory viruses. 4, 5 Genetic characterization of the virus from geographically diverse patient samples is key to infer the rate of spread. Additionally, rapid and complete results from cases worldwide are important for sequence-dependent countermeasures and accurate diagnostics. However, as the virus reaches resource-limited settings in proximity to the outbreak's epicenter, such as Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, there are often logistical challenges in surveillance, contact tracing, sample collection, and biospecimen transport. Information delay is also compounded by a dearth of sequencing and/or bioinformatics expertise in-country, further postponing analysis and dissemination of pathogen genomic information.",

Since clinical specimens are obtained from suspected COVID-19 cases as part of the national outbreak response, requirement for informed consent was waived for pathogen identification and characterization. mNGS libraries were prepared from the viral RNA extracted from the sample. cDNA was converted to Illumina libraries using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit (E7645) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Library size and concentration were determined using the 4150 Tapestation system (Agilent, MA, USA). External RNA Controls 103 Consortium collection (ThermoFisher, 4456740) spike-in controls were used as markers of potential library preparation errors and for input RNA mass calculation. Sample was sequenced on an Illumina iSeq100 instrument using 150 nucleotide paired-end sequencing. A water (\"notemplate\") control was included in library preparation.

Taxa with Z-score less than 1, base pair alignment less than 50 base pairs, and reads per million (rpM) less than 10 were removed from analysis. Geneious Prime 2020.0.5 was used for separate de novo assembly and annotation of the draft SARS-CoV-2 genome. In subsequent runs to achieve higher coverage of the viral genome, two additional steps were taken: 1) the subsampling filter of the nonhost reads was removed and 2) targeted enrichment of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence using author/funder.

Despite major advances in mNGS technologies and significant decreases in costs associated with sequencing, preparation of sequencing libraries and sufficient bioinformatics capabilities for timely analysis still present a challenge in the developing world. 8 As cases of COVID-19 spread globally in mid-January, initial real-time PCR protocols took into account that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in humans and animals was not completely known. Non-specificity combined with variable sample quality can hinder ability to detect the pathogen in question.

This detection directly increased on-the-ground certainty in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of available assays. 7 mNGS in field settings proved critical in development of countermeasures for the 2014-2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, just as ongoing sequencing of COVID-19 cases from lesser developed areas of Southeast Asia will contribute to overall understanding of pathogen transmission, origin, and evolution. 9,10 While COVID-19 cases are not limited to one remote region, as is often the case with viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, sequenced samples from all countries will be important for global disease containment. Instead of being limited to consensus Sanger sequencing, which may not detect high risk quasispecies, metagenomics is a powerful approach to detect variants of both novel and known species as epidemics evolve. 11 The clear limitation in an mNGS approach is that low viral titers or high levels of host material demand greater read depth than may be available on instruments such as the iSeq100. To overcome this barrier, our follow-up steps included a target enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 while keeping the comprehensiveness of our mNGS pipeline intact. 6 For an emerging threat, this strategy offers the flexibility to successfully recover the pathogen genome in question for subsequent phylogenetic analyses without compromising discovery. However, the other key factor in mNGS success is the accessibility to open-access, cloud-based metagenomics bioinformatics pipelines, such as IDseq which automates the process of separating host sequence characterizing the remaining non-host sequences. 12 As recent as the Ebola epidemic, bioinformatics analyses were still mainly completed in the Global North. 10 This newly available combination -more rugged, deployable sequencers plus user-friendly, globally accessible bioinformatics -represents an opportunity for responders in limited-resource settings; however, further proof-of-principle during outbreaks remains necessary.",
