            "text": "The objective of this study was to elucidate the kinetics and magnitudes of speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses in intestines of turkey poults infected with turkey coronavirus (TCV). Turkey poults were orally inoculated with TCVat 10 days of age. Intestinal segment cultures were administered for duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and the IgA antibody responses were analyzed at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 9 weeks post-infection (PI) in two different experiments. The kinetics of virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were similar: gradually increased from 1 week PI, reached the peak at 3 or 4 weeks PI, and declined afterward. The virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum showed negative correlation with duration of TCV antigen in the corresponding locations of intestine with Spearman's correlation coef\u00aecient of \u00c00.85 p 0:034, \u00c00.74 p 0:096, and \u00c00.75 p 0:084, respectively. Moreover, the virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses in serum were positively correlated with that of duodenum coefficient 0:829; p 0:042, jejunum coefficient 0:829; p 0:042, and ileum coefficient 0:771; p 0:072 segment cultures, suggesting that the induction of speci\u00aec IgA response in serum was predictive of an IgA response in intestine. The results indicate that intestinal mucosal IgA antibodies to TCV are elicited in turkeys following infection with TCV. The local mucosal antibodies may provide protective immunity for infected turkeys to recover from TCV infection. #",

Virus-speci\u00aec IgA antibody responses to TCV were induced in intestinal mucosa of turkey poults infected with TCV. These IgA antibody responses were negatively correlated with the presence of TCV in the infected intestines. The elicited local mucosal antibodies may have provided protective immunity for infected turkeys to recover from TCV infection.",
