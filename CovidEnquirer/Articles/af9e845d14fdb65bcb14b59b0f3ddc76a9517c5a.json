            "text": "Since their discovery in 1953, human adenovirus strains (HAdVs) have been classified into seven species (A-G). More than 52 unique types [1] [2] [3] [4] have been found. HAdVs are widely distributed 5 and cause a broad spectrum of clinical diseases, including febrile respiratory illness (FRI), pneumonia, conjunctivitis, gastroenteritis, cardiomyopathy, and urinary tract infection. Severe disease and death caused by HAdV infections are rare among otherwise healthy individuals. 6, 7 Certain HAdV species, including B, C, and E, are wellknown causes of respiratory disease outbreaks. 8, 9 HAdVs belonging to species C (types 1, 2, 5, and 6) are generally endemic in children and adolescents. [9] [10] [11] Species E, comprising only HAdV type 4, is the most common pathogen in outbreaks of FRI among military recruits. 12, 13 The large HAdV species B includes two subspecies: B1 (types 3, 7, 16, 21, and 50) and B2 (types 11, 14, 34, and 35) . HAdV-3, 7, and 21 generally cause outbreaks of FRI and pneumonia among adolescents and adults 7 , whereas HAdV-34 and 35 are often associated with sporadic kidney and urinary tract infections. 1 HAdV-11, 14, and 16 have been infrequently associated with outbreaks of FRI 14, 15 until the strain HAdV-14p1 emerged in the United States in 2006. 15 In China, HAdVs have not been well studied. However, outbreaks of HAdV infection (i.e., HAdV-3, 7, and 11) have been previously described, particularly among primary and middle school students. [16] [17] [18] [19] In April 2011, the Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention in the Chinese Center for Disease and Prevention was notified of a cluster of HAdV respiratory infections in Tongwei County in the Gansu province. Throat swab specimens were collected from patients with FRI. HAdV-14p1 was determined as the causative pathogen for this outbreak. This is the first report of an FRI outbreak caused by HAdV-14p1 at a primary and middle school in China, as well as the first report of HAdV-14p1 infections in schoolaged children in the world.",

The student attended a school (grades 1-9; 11 classes, 28 teachers, and 487 students) located in Tongwei County, Gansu province, China. He continued to attend school and recovered from his symptoms after taking an unknown cold medication administered by the village health center for 3 days. Through a retrospective survey, we learned that the boy did not have contacts with patients exhibiting similar symptoms during 2 weeks prior the onset of the illness. He had also never travelled outside the town. After the index case, the outbreak peaked on April 10, 2011, with 10 cases detected. The last case was reported on April 19 ( Figure 1A ). During the outbreak, 43 students (8\u00c18%, 43/487 students) from the same school developed into FRI. The patients were 8-15 years old, and 53\u00c15% (23/43) of them were 12-13 years old. Children from seven classes were affected in this outbreak. Among them, 21 patients were from the fifth grade ( Figure 1B) , the same grade as the index patient. Twenty seven (62\u00c18%) of the 43 patients were boys. All the patients presented with fever (oral 38\u00b0C-40\u00b0C), sore throat, cough, headache, and fatigue, similar to influenza-like symptoms. Some of the patients experienced pharyngeal congestion, swollen tonsils, and submandibular lymphadenopathy, and a few patients were diagnosed with mild pneumonia. Given that no patient presented with severe symptoms, all the patients were treated at the village health center and continued to attend school without isolation. Many children presented with the same symptoms of a mild form of FRI. Public health officials at the local CDC office were engaged, and they undertook measures to prevent disease spread, such as morning temperature screening of children, ensuring ventilation through open doors and windows, and disinfecting school surfaces with 0\u00c12% peroxyacetic acid spray. On average, illnesses lasted for 4-5 days. There were no severe illnesses associated with this outbreak, and all the patients fully recovered. All the patients denied any history of travel in the 2 weeks prior to the onset of illness.",

HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 have been most frequently implicated in Chinese FRI outbreaks. [16] [17] [18] [19] Here, we report the first outbreak of FRI associated with HAdV-14p1 at a primary and middle school in China and the first schoolbased HAdV-14p1 outbreak in the world. HAdV-14 was initially discovered in 1955 in the Netherlands, 25 and it was subsequently isolated in Great Britain in the same year, 26 Uzbekistan in 1962, 27 and Czechoslovakia in 1963. 28 Its detection was not reported for the next 40 years, with the only exception of the sporadic isolation in the Netherlands during 1974. HAdV subspecies B2 was found only in Eurasia before HAdV-14 was detected in North America in 2006. 15 Afterward, HAdV-14p1 spread widely and caused severe cases and deaths in adults in the United States. 29 Deaths associated with HAdV-14p1 infection were also recently reported in Europe. 30 This HAdV-14p1 outbreak produced a series of mild FRI symptoms among children of 8-15 years of age. The outbreak differed from that in the US HAdV-14p1 outbreak reports in that the US adults often suffered severe pneumonia and death. The age of the patients in China likely played an important role in attenuating the disease severity. 7 In our study, male patients accounted for 62\u00c18% (27/43) of the cases, which was similar to other observations. [30] [31] [32] The significance of gender as a risk factor for HAdV-14p1 infection was unknown. We hypothesized that it was due to the poor hygienic behaviors of school-aged boys.",

The high homology between HAdV-14p1 isolated from Beijing, Guangzhou, and Gansu between 2010 and 2011 supported the hypothesis of a stable evolution and transmission of HAdV-14p1 in China. In our study, amplifications of the hypervariable regions of the hexon gene from 11 HAdV-positive specimens were identical to HAdV-14p1 and classified as such. As reported by Kajon et al., 35 further molecular typing and analysis aimed at the complete amplification of hexon, fiber, and E1A gene evidenced that the outbreak HAdV-14p1 isolates were nearly identical to other HAdV-14p1 strains isolated in the United States, Europe, and China between 2006 and 2010.",
