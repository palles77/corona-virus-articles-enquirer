The K40/09 strain was selected during successive serial passages in specific-pathogen free (SPF) embryonated eggs at sub-optimal higher temperature (56 \u2022 C). Unlike the parental strain, the attenuated strain, designated K40/09 HP50, was found to be safe in 1-day-old SPF chicks, which showed neither mortality nor signs of morbidity, and rarely induced ciliostasis or histological changes in the trachea and kidney after intraocular and fine-spray administration. K40/09 HP50 provided almost complete protection against two distinct subgroups of a nephropathogenic strain (KM91-like and QX-like subgroup) and elicited the production of high titers of neutralizing antibody (neutralization index of 3.6). We conclude that the K40/09 HP50 vaccine virus is rapidly attenuated by heat adaptation and exhibits the desired level of attenuation, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy required for a live attenuated vaccine. These results indicate that the K40/09 vaccine could be helpful for the reduction of economic losses caused by recently emergent nephropathogenic IBV infection in many countries.",

The virus causes severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide because it can affect the upper respiratory and reproductive tracts, and some strains can cause nephritis in chickens [1] . It is well known that the primary problem in the control of infectious bronchitis is the ability of the virus to generate antigenic diversity by inaccuracy of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and high frequency of homologous RNA recombination [2, 3] . Many studies have shown that the degree of cross-protection tends to decrease among IBV serotypes and genotypes [4, 5] .",

However, producing a live IBV vaccine requires lengthy strategies that are time, cost, and labor intensive. Attenuation of IBV by multiple passages (over 100) in embryonated eggs can delay a new vaccine's clinical availability for several years. This drawback is compounded by the time required for verification of the vaccine to obtain licensing, as well as the current lack of available cell lines for vaccine production, which could accelerate vaccine production. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the viral strain used to produce the vaccine will still be endemic at the time of vaccination [7] [8] [9] .",

This new cluster, represented by the K40/09 strain, is a natural recombinant strain between the Korean nephropathogenic strain KM91 and the QXIBV strain. In a previous challenge study, we characterized the Korean variant IBV K40/09 strain with regard to its immunogenicity and crossprotective efficacy against heterotype strains and its potential as a vaccine candidate [11] . The development of a temperature-adapted vaccine has been attempted to increase safety and shorten the time of attenuation in several studies [12] [13] [14] . However, our experience shows that, besides desirable levels of attenuation and immunogenicity, other traits such as good growth properties should also be considered for live vaccine strains, and that this attenuation process may not work for all viruses. In the present study, we evaluated the safety and cross-protective efficacy of heat-adapted, live attenuated IBV derived from the K40/09 strain. The results of the present study might provide information for future IBV vaccine development and vaccination strategies.",

The initial selection of the K40/09 virus for this purpose was guided by the fact that this strain has a favored vaccine candidate background that contains two genetically characterized nephropathogenic strains (KM91 and QXIBV) as a recombinant strain [22] and showed significantly high levels of immunogenicity and protective ability against many different types of IBV [11] . Our approach to heat-adapting IBV differed in two ways from previous attempts [13] . Differences included the viral strain (nephropathogenic IBV strain) and the number of passages at high temperature (up to 50 times). In general, current methods for IBV attenuation include serial passage of virus in chicken embryos over 50 times, and the nephropathogenic IBV strain seemed particularly refractory to attenuation [7, 8] . Although the mechanism of heat attenuation is unknown, this is the first study to attenuate a nephropathogenic IBV strain by heat adaptation. Furthermore, based on our data, it is likely that adaptation at progressively higher temperatures would provide rapid attenuation of IBV and selective pressure for cumulative mutations that confer less virulence for chickens.",

            "text": "Spray vaccination is one of the most common vaccination practices performed worldwide in the poultry industry [4] , as it triggers local immunity in the upper respiratory tract and also stimulates general humoral immune responses [23, 24] . However, fine droplets (50-80 m in size) containing the vaccine virus might be inhaled too deeply into the respiratory tract (lung and air sac) tissues, resulting in disease with an excessive post-vaccination reaction in young chicks. Thus, the use of a coarse spray with a droplet size greater than 100 m is generally suitable for hatchery vaccination. The safety of K40/09 HP50 was demonstrated by administering the vaccine to 1-day-old SPF chicks via spray. Based on their safety profiles, the non-and low-heat-passaged viruses (K40/09 and K40/09 HP40) produced a milder clinical disease response with mild histopathological lesions of tracheas and kidneys when administered by fine spray, but the K40/09 HP50 virus was no longer pathogenic for 1-day-old chicks, as demonstrated by lower ciliostasis and histopathologic lesion scores. Considering the fact that spray vaccination was applied using fine spray (50-m droplets) in our safety study, K40/09 HP50 is considered to be very safe and useful for hatchery spray vaccination.",

            "text": "Adjusting the balance between attenuation and immunogenicity is a critical factor in developing live vaccines due to the possibility of over-attenuation, which leads to poor protection with a loss in immunogenicity [25] . Although the K40/09 parental strain was chosen based on its cross-protective ability [8] , it is not clear whether the fully attenuated K40/09 HP50 still induced cross-protection. In efficacy studies, all viruses (K40/09, K40/09 HP40, and K40/09 HP50) provided almost complete protection for tracheas and kidneys against nephropathogenic strains of Korean group II (QXIBVlike and KM91 strains) with high neutralizing-antibody titers. These findings indicate that K40/09 HP50 retained its immunogenicity after serial passage. Nephropathogenic strains of different serotypes are a major problem worldwide; therefore, it has been proposed that the polyvalent vaccine formulation expanded the level of cross-protection against nephropathogenic IBV strains over that achieved by individual vaccine strains [26] . However, the use of multiple strains of live vaccines may contribute to the variation and recombination of IBV, and engender even more complex IBV epidemics. Conversely, our results suggest that single administration of K40/09 HP50 is markedly effective and economical due to its broad-spectrum protection against nephropathogenic IBV strains, including QXIBV, which are worldwide epizootic strains [11] .",

These characteristics of coronaviruses create difficulties in the design of disease control strategies; therefore, vaccine candidates that offer broad-spectrum protection and methodologies that shorten the time of live vaccine development are needed. The results of the present study show that heat adaptation could be a very useful method to enhance the safety of IBV, and the heat-adapted K40/09 HP50 virus exhibits a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity, and exhibits cross-protective efficacy. These results further suggest that the heat-adapted K40/09 HP50 virus can help to reduce economic losses caused by newly evolving nephropathogenic IBV strains and improve IB vaccine effectiveness in many countries where IBV infection is a major problem.",
