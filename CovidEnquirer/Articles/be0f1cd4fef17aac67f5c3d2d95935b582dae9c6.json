A59 virus is a hepatotropic strain of MHV, causing extensive hepatic necrosis and leading to death within a week (Manaker et al., 1961) . When injected intracerabrally, the virus leads to encephalitis (Robb et al., 1979) . For the neurotropic strain of mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-4(JHM), a clear difference was observed between wild-type virus and mutant ts-8 (Haspel et al., 1978) . Whereas wild-type virus produced a rapid and fatal encephalomyelitis, the mutant induced a prolonged infection of the central nervous system accompanied by demyelination and mice survived. Immunocytochemical studies in viva have shown that ts-8 has a restricted tropism for neurons and replicates mostly in oligodendrocytes (Knobler et al, 1981) .",

Some investigators have reported that the virus has a very low virulence and a weak pathogenicity (Lai and Stohlman, 1981; Robb et al, 1979) . This might be explained by assuming that these investigators were working with a nonpathogenic variant of the original virus isolated by Manaker et al. (1961) . A more likely explanation, however, is that the mice used for the pathogenic studies had antibodies against mouse hepatitis virus (Robb et al., 1979) . We have always checked our mice for the absence of anti-MHV antibodies by a plaque reduction assay, before they were used for pathogenic studies. Doing so we were able to confirm the observation of Manaker et al (1961) that the virus is indeed highly pathogenic and virulent, when injected intracerebrally or intraperitoneally. We show here that attenuated virus has drastically attenuated pathogenic properties and is able to cause more prolonged infection of the central nervous system. In this respect there seems to be little differenee between so-called hepatotropic MHV-A59 and ~e~rotro~i~ detailed study on the time course of the development of the lesions in the nervous system and the cells inv in progress.",
