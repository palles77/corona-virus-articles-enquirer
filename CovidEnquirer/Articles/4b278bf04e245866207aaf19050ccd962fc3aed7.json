We subjected CHIKV-infected Human Embryo Kidney cells (HEK293), a widely used cell-based system for CHIKV infection studies, to a high throughput expression proteomics analysis by Liquid Chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 1047 differentially expressed proteins were identified in infected cells, consistently in three biological replicates. Proteins involved in transcription, translation, apoptosis and stress response were the major ones among the 209 proteins that had significant up-regulation. In the set of 45 down-regulated proteins, those involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism predominated. A STRING network analysis revealed tight interaction of proteins within the apoptosis, stress response and protein synthesis pathways. We short-listed a common set of 30 proteins that can be implicated in cellular pathology of CHIKV infection by comparing our results and results of earlier CHIKV proteomics studies. Modulation of eight proteins selected from this set was re-confirmed at transcript level. One among them, Nucleophosmin, a nuclear chaperone, showed temporal modulation and cytoplasmic aggregation upon CHIKV infection in double immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. The short-listed cellular proteins will be potential candidates for targeted study of the molecular interactions of CHIKV with host cells.",

These and the epidemics that followed in subsequent years ran an explosive course leading to extreme morbidity and attributed mortality to this originally benign virus infection. Apart from classical symptoms of acute fever and debilitating polyarthralgia lasting for several weeks, a number of complications were documented. These included aphthous-like ulcers and vesiculo-bullous eruptions on the skin, hepatic involvement, central nervous system complications such as encephalopathy and encephalitis, and transplacental transmission.",

The Asian genotype of this positive-stranded RNA virus of the Alphavirus genus has been attributed in these outbreaks. However, the disease ran a similar course as the one caused by the East, Central and South African (ECSA) genotype in the other parts of the world. Studies have documented a number of mutations in the re-emerging strains of the virus that enhances mosquito adaptability and modulates virus infectivity. This might support the occurrence of fiery outbreaks in the absence of herd immunity in affected population. Several research groups work to understand the pathogenesis of chikungunya and the mechanisms of complications using cellular and animal models. A few proteomics approaches have been employed earlier to understand the protein level changes in the infected cells. Our present study, which couples a high throughput proteomic analysis and a comparative review of these earlier studies, identifies a few critical molecules as hypothetical candidates that might be important in this infection and for future study.",

Conventional gel-based systems for the purpose use a two-dimensional protein electrophoresis followed by protein identification by mass spectrometry. The newer shotgun proteomics methods have greatly enhanced the spatiotemporal resolution of proteome identification compared to these conventional methods and use liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [3] . However, irrespective of these advances, the cross-platform consistency of many proteomics studies in repeatedly identifying the same set of proteins has been rather low, even for identical disease conditions [4] . Variations in experimental design or adopted methodologies can be attributed for these discrepancies. Nevertheless, this has necessitated a comparative approach of multiple studies to reach a meaningful conclusion of the molecules and pathways reliably linked to the pathological process. The present study describes the use of such an approach for understanding the cellular infection process by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a recently re-emerged pathogen.",

The increase in macromolecular synthesis for the generation of viral components also trigger synthesis of host factors that promote cell sustenance and survival resulting in an overall increase in the host cell biosynthetic activity [22] . Earlier studies in Sindbis virus infection, the prototype Alphavirus, have identified modulation of mitochondrial bioenergetics to favor ATP synthesis that is required to support active viral replication [23] . Similarly, in our study we see that the mitochondrial proteins are regulated during CHIKV infection in the HEK293 cell line. Most of the enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism like gluconeogenesis and glycolysis leading to the citric acid cycle are modulated upon infection. All the products of nutrient catabolism are fed to the central pathway of citric acid cycle by the formation of acetylCoA. Modulation of several key enzymes in this pathway indicates that the CHIKV infection regulates the oxidative phosphorylation leading to ATP synthesis by the electron transport chain.",

Many positive-sense RNA viruses use this pathway to eliminate excess viral proteins that prevent viral replication [25] . The proteasome is a multi-catalytic proteinase complex that has an ATP-dependent proteolytic activity and is characterized by its ability to cleave peptides with Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu, and Glu. The cytosolic 26S proteasome has one 20S protein subunit and two 19S regulatory cap subunits. We found the modulation of several proteasomal proteins as a key component in CHIKV infected cells. Also, there was modulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes that catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other proteins. These observations strongly suggest that the CHIKV infection activates the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway (UPP) leading to protein degradation. The increase in the UPP thus helps in selectively eliminating the abnormally folded or damaged proteins produced during infection. Similar observations on the requirement of the components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system have been shown for the maturation and release of a number of viruses [26] . Proteomics studies have also shown the functional role of UPP in infection by many viruses such as Dengue virus [27] , Hepatitis B virus [28] and Japanese encephalitis virus [29] .",

In CHIKV infection, activation of the cellular protein, protein kinase R (PKR), plays a role in the inhibition of host protein synthesis [40] . Also, similar to other Alphaviruses, nsP2 induces a cellular shut-off that blunts the host antiviral response and finally kills infected cells [41] . The cellular shut-off is a multi-step process in which several components are regulated. One of the key steps is posttranscriptional modification, like splicing. This splicing mechanism is done by spliceosome which is assembled from snRNPs and protein complexes. Several proteins that play a role in splicing machinery are up-regulated in CHIKV infected cells. Modulation of the spliceosome assembly and regulation were also detected in other viral infections like Herpes simplex virus in proteomic analysis [42] . Also, several tRNA synthetases are up-regulated during CHIKV infected HEK293 cells as shown in other viral infections [36, 43] . CHIKV infection also led to the up-regulation of some of the ribosomal proteins that are involved in the translational machinery. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (EIF4B) and its binding protein EIF4EBP1 are important in cellular mRNA translation and play a role in mTOR signaling pathway in the apoptotic processes. Hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in other viral infections such as in African Swine Fever Virus infection has been reported [44] . Both these proteins are up-regulated in CHIKV infected cells.",

All the four major pathways that we have identified in our study have been found to be modulated during CHIKV infection in one or more of these earlier studies. Among the four, the energy metabolism and stress response pathways were found as the major affected pathways in common. Our analysis to identify common proteins from the present study and earlier reports identified 30 proteins (Table 2) , which are discussed below. Our results are more comparable to the proteomic study done by Thio et al. [10] using WRL-68 cells, which is another cell line of epithelial origin like HEK293. Irrespective of an inverse pattern of modulation (up-regulation vs down-regulation) of many of them, a number of proteins were in common in these two studies that were modulated during infection.",

It is a multifunctional protein involved in ribosome biogenesis, nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis [53] . Interestingly in earlier studies on CHIKV proteomics, this protein was found to be up-regulated at cellular level in both WRL-68 cells and SJCRH30 cells [10, 11] . In our study, the modulation of NPMI in HEK293 cells was prominently visible at 48 h p.i. as a speckle formation in the cell cytoplasm ( Fig. 6a & b) . The aggregation of these proteins could be because of its interaction with viral proteins or with other cellular proteins, which is an interesting lead for further investigation.",

Interestingly, all these pathways were documented in earlier proteomics studies done in CHIKV infection. Further, a comparative analysis of the results from our study and earlier studies identified 30 proteins that were consistently modulated in all the studies. Preliminary analysis indicates that the nuclear chaperone, Nucleophosmin, might be a player in CHIKV infection also, as seen in certain other viral infections in earlier studies [51, 52] . These short-listed proteins will serve as a starting point for targeted studies using single-molecule approach to decipher CHIKV-host interaction.",

At 48 h p.i., CHIKV infected and mock-infected cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis. The virus infection was detected using anti-CHIKV E2 envelope protein rabbit polyclonal serum at 1:50 dilution. Alexafluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody. A focus of infection in the infected cells indicated by the green cytoplasmic fluorescence is shown. (b) Hoechst staining of CHIKV infected HEK293 cells. Monolayer cultures of the cells were infected at MOI 1. Infected and mock-infected cells were stained at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h p.i. with the nuclear staining dye Hoechst 33342 for 20 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark before visualization. Images were captured with a LucaR (Andor) EMCCD camera using NIS elements software under identical exposure and gain settings for the infected cells as well as the controls. (c) Quantitative estimation of the condensed nuclei in infected HEK293 cells. Each value is an average of four fields from three independent experiments. (d) Quantification of apoptosis and necrosis in infected HEK 293 cells. Cells infected at MOI 1 and mock infected cells were collected at respective time points and stained with Annexin V-EnzoGold and Necrosis Detection Reagent as per manufacturer's directions and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Aria Special order system) at 585/42 and 695/40 band filters. Q1 represents the non-viable cells undergone necrosis, Q2 has cells from both late apoptosis and necrosis stages, Q3 the most viable healthy cells and Q4, cells from early apoptosis stage. Representative images of two independent experiments are shown.",
