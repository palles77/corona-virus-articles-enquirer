The synthetic steroids were completely characterized by one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR and FABMS spectra. Sulfation was performed using triethylamine-sulfur trioxide complex in dimethylformamide as the sulfating agent. The sulfated steroids were comparatively evaluated for their inhibitory effect on the replication of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Compounds 7 and 8 were the most effective in their inhibitory action against HSV-2. The disulfated steroid 8 also proved to be active against DEN-2 and JV. (M.S.

These compounds have exhibited a broad spectrum of biologic activities, such as anti-HIV effects [3] and inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases [4] . Among echinoderms, ophiuroids are characterized by their content of sulfated steroids with sulfate groups located at C-3 and C-21 and additional hydroxy groups located in rings A and C. Recently, we have demonstrated the antiviral activity of sulfated steroids isolated from the cold water ophiuroids, Ophioplocus januarii [5] and Astrotoma agassizii [6] , and synthetic derivatives and analogs against pathogenic viruses of humans [7] . Steroids sulfated at C-21 and C-2 (\u2424) or C-3 (\u2423) with an additional hydroxyl function at C-2 (\u2424) or C-3 (\u2423) were the most effective in their inhibitory action against herpes simplex virus (HSV-2).

On the other hand, the reaction of compound 5 with 2 equivalents of the sulfating reagent at room temperature rendered after ion exchange sodium 2\u2424,3\u2423-dihydroxy-5\u2423-cholestane 3-sulfate (6) and sodium 2\u2424,3\u2423-dihydroxy-5\u2423-cholestane 2-sulfate (7) in a 6.5:3.5 ratio, together with minor amounts of the disulfated derivative 8 (Scheme 2). Compounds 6, 7, and 8 were purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by HRFABMS and 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy (Tables 1 and 2) . The assignments of the NMR signals were derived from 1 H-1 H COSY and HETCOR experiments. Disodium 2\u2424,3\u2423-dihydroxy-5\u2423-cholestane disulfate (8) showed two methine signals at \u03b4 4.73 (H-2) and 4.70 (H-3) , characteristic of the presence of two sulfate groups at C-2 and C-3 [13] . This is in accordance with the chemical shifts observed for C-2 (76.1) and C-3 (76.1) in the 13 C NMR spectrum. The 13 C NMR spectra of monosulfated compounds 6 and 7 differed in the chemical shifts of C-1 (\u03b4 41.0 in 6, 38.8 in 7), C-2 (\u03b4 70.0 in 6, 78.8 in 7), C-3 (\u03b4 78.5 in 6, 69.0 in 7), and C-4 (\u03b4 30.3 in 6, 32.5 in 7). The downfield shift of 9.5 ppm for C-3 and the upfield shift of 2.2 ppm for C-4 in compound 6 indicated that the sulfate group was located at C-3. These values confirm the assignment of the position of the sulfate group in ring A for disodium (20R)-2\u2424,3\u2423,21-trihydroxy-5\u2423-cholest-24-ene-3,21-disulfate, isolated previously by us from the antarctic ophiuroid A. agassizii [6] . The presence of the sulfate group at C-2 in 7 was confirmed by the downfield shift of 8.8 ppm for C-2 and the upfield shift of 2.2 ppm for C-1. 1 Looking forward for a major selectivity in the obtention of monosulfated analogs, an alternative synthetic strategy was tried (Scheme 3). Diol 5 was treated with acetic anhydride in pyridine rendering the diacetylated compound 9, which was submitted to selective deprotection with BBTO. This reagent has been utilized for the deprotection of a variety of steroid esters in non-hydrolytic conditions, in particular in the selective hydrolysis of the 3\u2424-acetyl group in the presence of the 6\u2423 one in 3\u2424,6\u2423-diacetoxy-5\u2423-pregnan-20-one [14] . As shown in Scheme 2, when a solution of diacetate 9 in toluene and BBTO was refluxed for 5 h, a mixture of monoacetylated compounds 10 and 11 was obtained in 89% yield in a 2.7:7.3 ratio. Both monoacetylated derivatives were separated and purified by chromatography and treated separately with triethylamine-sulfur trioxide complex in the same reaction conditions used for the monosulfation of diol 5 to give the sulfated analogs 12 and 13. It is to note that while sulfation of compound 11 rendered only compound 13, compound 10 afforded the expected sulfated analog 12 together with compound 7 derived from the deacetylation of 12. As compounds 7 and 12 were easily separated by HPLC, compound 7 was further transformed into 12 by a simple acetylation reaction. 1 H and 13 C NMR data of compound 12 (Tables 1 and 2) confirmed that the sulfate group is located at C-2 (\u03b4 C 76.0 ppm, \u03b4 H 4.44 ppm) and the acetoxy group is attached to C-3 (\u03b4 C 72.2 ppm, \u03b4 H 5.11 ppm). The spectroscopic data of 13 revealed that the 2\u2424-hydroxy group remained protected (\u03b4 C 72.6 ppm, \u03b4 H 5.14 ppm) while the sulfation took place at the free 3\u2423-hydroxy group (\u03b4 C 75.5 ppm, \u03b4 H 4.40 ppm). Again, assignment of proton and carbon resonances was based on the analysis of 1 H, 13 C, DEPT, 1 H-1 H COSY, and HETCOR NMR experiments.",

These results indicated that, as it was expected, groups attached to C-3 with \u2423 configuration were more reactive than those attached to C-2 (\u2424) because of the steric hindrance due to the axial methyl group (C-19) at C-10 ( Fig. 2) . The antiviral activity of the five compounds was tested against HSV-2, the agent responsible for primary and recurrent infections of mucous membranes, genital lesions, neonatal infections, and meningitis [15] . From the data shown in Table 3 , compounds 7 and 8 were the most active against HSV-2 with IC 50 values of 19.3 and 23.9 g/ml, respectively. Monosulfated steroid 6, differing from 7 in the position of the sulfate group as well as acetylated and sulfated compound 13 were not active against HSV-2 at a concentration up to 25 g/ml. The four steroids also showed virucidal activity against HSV-2 with values of VC 50 ranging from 19.4 to 76.0 g/ml. Due to its low cytotoxic effect on Vero cells, the monosulfated steroid 12 containing an acetyl group at C-2 was assayed for antiviral activity at a higher concentration. Nevertheless, only a weak inhibitory activity against HSV-2 was observed (IC 50 = 90.5 g/ml). No virucidal effect of this compound was observed up to 100 g/ml. Of all the synthetic compounds tested, disulfated steroid 8 showed the best selectivity index (SI = 2.8). This result enabled us to test the antiviral activity of 8 against two pathogenic viruses in humans: JV and DEN-2. JV causes a severe disease in humans known as Argentine hemorrhagic fever [16] and DEN infection results in acute febrile illness or a more severe manifestation known as DEN hemorrhagic fever-shock syndrome [17] . Derivative 8 was not active against JV at a concentration up to 25 g/ml, while it elicited a marked DEN-2 inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 16.9 \u00b1 0.2 g/ml). Several sulfated polyhydroxysterols have been recently isolated from sponges [18] . Most of these natural products are characterized by the 2\u2424,3\u2423,6\u2423-tri-O-sulfate functions but several bioactive sterols sulfated at C-2 (\u2424) and C-3 (\u2423) containing additional alkylation in the side chain have been isolated from the sponges Petrosia weinbergi [13, 19] ( [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] and Pachastrella sp. [20] (19) (Fig. 3) . Weinbesterols A (14) and B (15) and orthoesterol disulfates A (16), B (17) , and C (18) exhibited in vitro activity against the feline leukemia virus (FeLV), mouse influenza virus (PR8), and mouse corona virus. Compound 14 was also active in vitro against HIV. Halistanol disulfate B (19) was active in the endothelin-converting enzyme assay while the corresponding diol was totally inactive.",

Although compound 5 showed no cytotoxic effect on Vero cells (CC 50 > 200 g/ml) it was not active against HSV-2 at a concentration up to 50 g/ml and showed no virucidal effect (VC 50 > 100 g/ml). These results are indicative of the role of the sulfate groups in the antiviral activity of 8. Due to its antiviral activity, disulfated steroid 8 is a good model compound for further introducing additional functional groups at the steroidal skeleton or its side chain in order to evaluate structure-activity correlations in the inhibitory activity against pathogenic viruses in humans.",
