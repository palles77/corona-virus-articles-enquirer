However, HTS faces a daunting challenge regarding the fast-growing numbers of drug targets arising from genomic and proteomic research, and large chemical libraries generated from highthroughput synthesis. There is an urgent need to find new ways to profile the activity of large numbers of chemicals against hundreds of biological targets in a fast, low-cost fashion. Chemical microarray can rise to this challenge because it has the capability of identifying and evaluating small molecules as potential therapeutic reagents. During the past few years, chemical microarray technology, with different surface chemistries and activation strategies, has generated many successes in the evaluation of chemicalprotein interactions, enzyme activity inhibition, target identification, signal pathway elucidation and cell-based functional analysis. The success of chemical microarray technology will provide unprecedented possibilities and capabilities for parallel functional analysis of tremendous amounts of chemical compounds.",

At the same time, high-throughput synthesis of small molecules is also widely practiced to generate large numbers of chemicals in a short time period. As a result, different HTS methods have been introduced and widely utilized. To further increase the throughput and reduce the cost of chemicals and targets, the miniaturization of biological assays has been the trend in today's assay development and laboratory automation. The conventional microtiter-plate-based assays have moved away from the 96-well format to the 384-well system, or even the 1536-well (or more) platform, or microfluidic systems [2] . However, the cost associated with replacing old systems by high-throughput and high-precision automations is substantial.",

Microarrays, such as DNA and protein microarrays, have played indispensable roles in genomic and proteomic research [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . By contrast, the development of chemical microarrays, also called chemical compound microarrays or small-molecule microarrays, capable of evaluating a large number of chemical structures against hundreds of biological targets, has been a slow process [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . One of the key problems of developing such chemical microarrays is that compounds with different structures and properties are traditionally screened in a solution phase, and individual reactions need to be isolated in wells. When reactions are reduced to microarray size no existing automatic liquid handling system can process these reactions individually, separately and sequentially if each reaction is still kept in a solution phase. Therefore, chemical microarray technology, which directly links chemicals to the chip surface, was introduced [13] [14] [15] [16] . However, compared with DNA and protein microarrays, no general linking technology can be established to immobilize compounds processing different structures and functional groups on the same chip surface. To avoid the potential complicated immobilization process, microarray with dry compounds has been developed [17, 18] . This technology can deposit any chemical compound library on the same chip surface in a dry form; however, different compounds possessing different dissolution rates can create problems with reaction uniformity and endpoint data comparison. Recently, chemical microarray technology has also been successfully used for cellbased assays by infusing small molecules with biodegradable polymer [19] , but the different physical properties of chemical compounds would also result in different diffusion endpoints. Given that there are >10 40 potential low molecular weight chemical compounds available in theory [20] , one might imagine that many difficulties could be encountered with the approaches outlined above.",

In this format each compound is individually arrayed on a glass surface -with a reaction buffer containing a low concentration of glycerol to prevent evaporation. Therefore, as in conventional well-based screening, the chemical compounds and biological targets are always in reaction solutions, which are activated with biological targets by delivering analytes using aerosol deposition technology [21] [22] [23] . With this approach all compounds [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] and peptide libraries [26, 27] can be microarrayed, and activated by biological targets in the form of pure protein [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] or cell lysate [24] .

One out of eight hits from the primary binding screening had activity in a secondary cell-based screening assay, with a dissociation constant (K d ) value of 18.1 mM. After SAR analysis, a small group of derivatives was synthesized, based on the lead structure, and a second-generation compound emerged with better solubility and an improved K d of 7.5 mM. Interestingly, this compound selectively activated only the Nil1p-dependent glucose-sensitive signaling pathway, but not the Gln3-dependent nitrogen nutrient-responsive signaling pathway.

As a result, scientists from Graffinity Pharmaceuticals have created a fragment chemical microarray system that immobilizes a few thousand drug fragments or pharmacophores (http://www.graffinity.com/t_elements.php#). In this unique platform, the low-complexity drug-like compounds are synthesized and immobilized on microarrays with a specially designed selfassembled monolayer (SAM), and a thin gold layer provides the base for this SAM and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection. The microarray chips are then treated with the biological target without labeling. A Plasmon Imager 1 , based on the phenomenon of SPR, is then used to record the mass change generated by soluble proteins bound on immobilized chemical surfaces. A wavelength shift in the SPR setting, corresponding to the amount of proteins bound to the chemical surface, helps to create the protein-ligand affinity fingerprints. With this approach, drug-like fragments with high binding affinity towards protein targets were quickly identified [33] (Figure 2 ). Compared with more-traditional small-molecule screening, binding affinity is generally weaker in this system (K d values in mM range) but the percentage of fragments capable of binding to particular proteins is higher. The quality of the lead compounds will also depend heavily on how the initial screening data are interpreted. Therefore, Graffinity has created a whole process that is termed RAISE 1 (rapid array informed structure evolution), which includes SAR analysis for identification and development of drug candidates from their screening database ( Figure 2 ). This label-free affinity binding assay can detect weak protein-ligand interactions and reduce labor and reagent costs by simplifying the initial screening work. However, because of the use of chemical fragments, this technology cannot utilize the tremendous values of existing chemical libraries. There is also no clear answer as to how many fragments screened will be enough, therefore this approach can potentially lose leads because of biased microarrays, created by lacking certain chemical fragments.",

In this study, a library of $250,000 compounds from different structural classes was screened and novel inhibitors from different classes identified. Using similar approaches, Abbott scientists have applied the mARCS technology to different enzymes. For example, Gopalakrishnan and co-workers [18] used the same technology to screen for caspase inhibitors. First, 8640 discrete compounds were spotted and dried onto a polystyrene sheet the same size as a conventional microtiter plate. Then, an agarose gel containing caspase-3 was laid on top of the compounds, followed by a second agarose gel with peptide substrate placed on top of the enzyme gel -starting the reaction. Groebe et al. [34] and Freiberg et al. [35] have reported other protease-and kinase-based screening approaches -using radiometric detection methods for kinases ( Figure 3 ). One interesting application of this technology was to use it for identifying agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors [36] . HEK-293 cells coexpressing human dopamine D(4.4) receptor and chimeric G(a qo5 ) protein, preloaded with the Ca 2+ indicator Fluo-4 acetoxymethyl ester, were cast into a 1% agarose gel, then placed above the compound sheet. Agonists will increase the cytosolic Ca 2+ level, which will result in enhanced fluorescence upon binding to the intracellular Fluo-4. Discovery Partners International (DPI) has licensed the mARCS technology from Abbott for commercialization, and further improved the whole process from microarray spotting and agarose gel casting to imaging and data analysis [37] . At DPI, scientists arrayed a total of 4608 chemical compounds (20 nl), in duplicate on a standard array that had a footprint of a microtiter plate, using the modified Gilson Constellation TM system with syringe-solenoid dispensing technology. With this method, the compounds are dried immediately after spotting and can be stored in a gas-tight inert atmosphere for future assays. Although the platform has been tested for many diversified targets, including enzymes and receptors [37] , one of the major problems with this approach is that the rate and capability of resolubilization and diffusion of different classes of dry compounds will complicate the dynamic range of arrayed compounds versus bioavailable compounds. To address this question, Cheng et al. [38] have characterized the diffusion of 59 compounds with diverse properties by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to determine how much compound was left on the polystyrene sheet after incubation with the agarose gel for defined periods of time. As expected, the study found that compounds of lower ClogP showed a higher rate of transfer to agarose gels, whereas other physical properties, such as molecular weight, size, acidity and H-bonding properties, have less effect on diffusion rate. The study demonstrated that the majority of the 59 compounds had >20% transfer after a 10 min incubation with agarose gels, providing sufficient amounts of compounds for screening purposes. The study also revealed that certain compounds might have transfer problems, thus yielding insufficient concentrations of compound for interaction with biotargets. This is a particular problem for in vitro screening campaigns in which fast enzyme reactions, weak inhibitors, weak receptor binders, hydrophobic compounds and complex natural products might be involved. Differential transfer rates in HTS will detect inhibitors at different kinetic time points, resulting in incomparable inhibition profiles. This would be a major challenge when IC 50 profiling a group of compounds against the same target, under the same reaction conditions.",

One of the first groups to try to combine peptide microarray technologies with conventional liquid handling methods to transfer kinase reactions to microarrays was that of Houseman and colleagues [39] .

To activate this solution-phase chemical microarray they adapted an aerosol deposition technology that converts biological targets into a fine mist, which can cover the top of the whole microarray simultaneously [21] . Exploiting this technology as a new tool for drug screening, Reaction Biology has licensed and developed solutionphase chemical microarray technology into a commercial product, the DiscoveryDot TM chemical microarray drug screening platform ( Figure 4) [22, 23] . DiscoveryDot TM is based on the principle of microarraying chemical libraries on a glass slide (1 inch \u00c2 3 inches) in formats with >6000 compounds per microarrayin a nonvolatile glycerol-based format compatible with \u00c080 8C storage. Each compound forms an individual well-less reaction center in a total volume of 1 nl. The biochemical reactions are then started by using aerosol deposition technology, and the reaction products are detected with a laser scanner or imager (Figure 4) . One of the key elements of DiscoveryDot TM is that the chemical com-pounds and targets are in solution throughout the whole process; therefore, all existing chemical libraries can be screened by this platform, making this technology the only universal chemical microarray to date. Because this solution-phase platform mimics the conventional large volume well-based system, the environment and mechanism of biochemical reactions on this microarray are very similar to the well-based reactions -but with higher efficiency for profiling multiple biotargets. For example, we have microarrayed the library of pharmacologically active compounds (LOPAC) on polylysine-coated slides, poly-(Glu-Tyr) peptidecoated slides, and dephosphorylated myelin basic protein (MBP)-coated slides, in parallel. The polylysine slides were then used for protease screening; the poly-(Glu-Tyr) peptide-coated slides were used for screening against Src, a tyrosine kinase, and the MBP-coated slides were used for screening against p38a, a serine-threonine protein kinase. Each round of screening for proteases and for Src has yielded many inhibitors (unpublished), but p38a screening has only yielded one particularly strong inhibitor, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1Himidazole (SB202190). When the same reaction was performed in a 384-well plate format the same compound was identified with similar potency [40] .",

For example, Ziauddin and Sabatini [41] have developed a reverse-transfection microarray by using gelatin to immobilize cDNA vectors on regular glass-surface chips (upon which cells can be grown) to study gene function. Using a similar approach, Stockwell and Sabatini's groups [19] have recently published the first chemical microarray format for cell-based high-content screening. In this study, biodegradable polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA 1 ) copolymer was used to impregnate the microarray surface with 200 mm diameter discs for each compound, and cells were then seeded on top of these compounds that were slowly diffused out to affect proximal cells. PLGA 1 , which has been used for delivering protein drugs, enabled the controlled release of proteins and small molecules through a combination of drug diffusion and polymer erosion. This chemical microarray technology has the potential for high-throughput cell-based assays, but must overcome a few obstacles before becoming useful as a broad platform. For example, finding one polymer for imbedding and releasing possibly millions of chemical compounds (with different physical properties) is a challenge. In addition, the release and stability of chemicals will affect the assays and comparison studies. Furthermore, the authors have noticed that chips printed >72 h before use are not as active as freshly printed chips. Data analysis is another challenge -because the concentration of compounds in cells decreases from the center of the array to the skirt. As a result, the effects of the compounds are also decreased at the outer edges, increasing the burden of data analysis in addition to the already complex format for microtiter-plate-based screening.",

            "text": "The new development of chemical microarray technology, capable of analyzing hundreds of thousands of chemicals with multiple biological targets in parallel, will further advance the HTS with its miniaturized reaction and parallel screening systems. Their applications, from target identification to the discovery of lead compounds, have made it a promising platform, useful in many drug discovery processes to reduce cost and shorten cycle time, while increasing productivity. Another advantage is that these technologies are easily accessed or evaluated, scientists from academia and industry with access to a DNA and protein microarray facility could perform some of the assays mentioned in this review, with certain modification, based on instrument availability. In addition, the markets for arrayers, assay detectors and data analysis are readily available (Table 1) . However, for one to take advantage of these chemical microarrays, a correct platform has to be selected. The summary in Table 2 can be used as a general guide for biochemical assays. For example, the immobilized microarray platform is preferred for fishing biological targets from a mixture of biofluid. Either dry forms or gel-pad forms can be used for almost all chemical and enzyme reactions, and cell-based assays are possible by using the slow-release property of polymers used for embedding the chemicals; however, the difference in rates of compound dissolution, diffusion and stability makes it difficult to observe uniform reactions. The solution-phase chemical microarray, which mimics the conventional well-based assays, can be used for homogeneous and heterogeneous assays with virtually all chemical compounds, enzymes and protein-protein interactions. However, the assay formats are limited at present by the availability of suitable detectors. This will continue to limit assay choice until detectors are developed with the necessary resolution and sensitivity to recognize the mm reaction centers.",
