These autoAb bound mainly to N-and C-terminal FAH peptides, the most reactive sequences being 1e50 and 390e420, respectively. Surprisingly, although FAH sequence 1e50 shares a high degree of homology with various MHV proteins, the C-terminal portion does not. Moreover, whereas the autoAb reacted with homologous peptides surrounding residues 70, 160 and 360, non-similar sequences around residues 130, 210, 240, 250, and 300 were also recognized, indicating that autoAb were not restricted to epitopes with sequence homologies. There was also a lack of correlation between the amount of anti-MHV or anti-FAH antibodies produced and the reactivity towards the peptides. Moreover, the spectrum of peptides recognized by the autoAb of a given mouse did not change significantly with time, which suggests that the MHV-elicited autoimmune response does not induce an epitope recognition spreading. Finally, anti-FAH Ab produced after immunization with rat liver FAH recognized essentially the same mouse FAH regions than autoAb from MHV-infected mice. Results indicated that the induction of the autoAb is not only related to molecular or structural mimicry, but rather supports the Danger model, in which any aggression, in this case the MHV infection, is susceptible to trigger the production of autoAb.",

ELISA and Western blot competition assays indicated that the autoAb could recognize either cryptic or native FAH epitopes, the response being different between individuals [4] . Furthermore, to analyze the Ab repertoire to sequential FAH epitopes in MHV-infected mice, a set of 24 decapeptides displaying at least 20% of identity between the sequence of mouse FAH and viral proteins E2, nucleocapside, E1 and RNA polymerase was used.

Competition assays indicated that the autoAb detected both conformational and cryptic FAH epitopes in ELISA but only cryptic determinants in Western blot assays, whereas anti-MHV Ab were directed to native epitopes of the viral proteins [4] . Such results suggested that MHV infection could trigger a crossreaction of either sequential or conformational epitopes between the viral proteins and the autoAg and that MHV-infected mice produce at least three different Ab populations: Ab specifically directed either to viral proteins or to the autoAg, and cross-reacting Ab [4] .",

Strikingly, whereas the Nterminal portion of FAH shares a high degree of homology with various MHV proteins, sequence 390e420 does not display any similarity with viral proteins. Furthermore, the au-toAb reacted with homologous peptides surrounding residues 70, 160 and 360, but non-homologous sequences around residues 130, 210, 240, 250 and 300 were also recognized. Thus, autoAb were not restricted to similar sequences, suggesting that structural patterns other than linear epitopes were involved in the autoimmune response. Accordingly, it has been proposed that viral regions that are able to initiate autoimmune responses do not need to have sequences analogous to the autoantigen [14] and, since the only requirement should be structural similarity, some authors propose that ''molecular mimicry'' should be changed to ''structural mimicry'' [15] .",

MHV is known to be lymphotropic and to induce diverse alterations of immune responses that depend on the mouse genetic background [1e4, 18, 19] , but why liver FAH was chosen as autoantigen among the large variety of liver proteins? As said by P. H Plotz [17] : ''The repertoire of target autoantigens is a wunderkammer e a collection of curiosities e of molecules with no obvious linking principle''. In the present model of MHV-induced anti-FAH autoAb, it seems that antigen mimicry e FAH N-terminal sequence is about 50% homologous with a MHV protein e together with the alarm signals released by the MHV-injured tissues leads to the autoimmune response.",
