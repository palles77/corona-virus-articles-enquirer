            "text": "The families Suidae (swine) and Tayassuidae (peccaries) are nonruminating ungulates belonging to the Suina clade or suborder within the order Artiodactyla. 49 Fossil records show suids appearing around 35 million years ago (upper Eocene era) in the part of the world now known as Thailand. 49 Of the family Suidae, Suinae is the only extant subfamily. The characteristics of suid molars have resulted in dividing the subfamily into different tribes. 49 The Hippohyini originated in Asia and have hypsodont dentition. Swine species from Africa with hypsodont dentition are in the Phacocherini tribe. The Suini tribe comprises members of the genus Sus. The Potamochoerini tribe includes the genera Hylochoerus and Potamochoerus. Molecular studies of Babyrousa spp. have yielded conflicting results, with some placing them in a separate tribe, Babirusina. Depending on the source, 14 to 19 species of suids exist (Table 58-1) . 15, 32, 35, 49 Recent references have given species designation to the subspecies of Babyrousa babirussa. 15, 49 The natural range of the Suidae family spans across Europe, Africa, Asia, and East Indies. Evidence to support any wild suids having originated in the Americas is lacking. They were introduced by humans into the Americas and into Australia, New Zealand, and New Guinea. Ancestors of extant peccaries are thought to have dispersed into the New World from eastern Asia. Currently, three species of peccary range from Southwestern United States to South America (Table 58-2) . 15, 28, 35, 49 Wild suids and peccaries have poor vision but good hearing and a keen sense of smell. They are known for their rooting behavior. Despite their short limbs they are good runners and jumpers, and some are adept swimmers. Bornean bearded pigs have been recorded as swimming 45 kilometers (km), and babirusas have been observed swimming underwater. 49 In general, wild suids and peccaries live in social groupings, although breeding males become solitary after the breeding season. Wild suid females and their offspring live in herds known as sounders. Suids are quite vocal, and peccaries make a characteristic clacking sound with their teeth. Wild suid and peccary populations are primarily threatened by habitat destruction through human encroachment and hunting. 14, 35, 49 Isolated island populations are particularly susceptible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status of selected species is provided in Table 58-3. 18",

In addition, peccaries only have one dewclaw on the hindlimbs, and hindlimb dewclaws are generally lacking in Chacoan pecarries. 49 Suid males are generally larger than females; however, little size dimorphism exists between sexes in peccaries. 14, 32, 49 The pelage of wild suids varies from being sparse in the babirusa to being entirely covered with coarse bristly hair in the wild boar. Peccaries have a dense covering of long, coarse bristles, which makes it difficult to estimate body condition, especially during piloerection.",

            "text": "The suid skull is unique in that it possesses an elongated flange of bone originating from the zygomatic root referred to as the prezygomatic shelf. 49 This shelf of bone separates the muscles of mastication from the muscles involved in snout movement. This adaptation is thought to facilitate rooting behavior. The disklike shape of the snout, the terminally placed nostrils, which are capable of closing, and the presence of a prenasal bone within the cartilaginous disk of the snout are also adaptions for rooting behavior. 32, 35, 49 The prenasal bone can be seen radiographically. Babirusas tend to root in soft, moist soils, hence their rostral bone is not as well developed as in other suids or is absent. 35, 49 The rostrum of the Chacoan peccary is reported to have a more complex internal anatomy compared with other peccaries, and this is theorized to be an adaptation to living in dusty, xeric conditions. 49 Another distinguishing feature of wild suids is their large canines. The orientation of canines in several species allows these teeth to grow upward and outward and thus capable of inflicting serious damage. In most species, the tusks of the males are larger than those of the females except in the warthog, in which both sexes have large tusks. The babirusa is known for its peculiar tusk arrangement. The alveoli of the upper canines rotate during development such that these teeth grow upward through the rostrum and spiral caudally. 49 The lower canines also grow in a spiral shape. Canines are markedly reduced or absent in female babirusas. In peccaries, canines point straight down, which allows interlocking. This arrangement facilitates stabilization of the jaw when the animal is cracking hard seeds between the other teeth. 14, 49 The dentition of suids has been used in their taxonomic classfication. 49 The desert warthog differs from other suids but is similar to other ungulates in that it does not have upper incisors. Smaller species of pigs have molars with high pointed cusps; these species tend to forage on forest vegetation and fruit, whereas larger species have dentition better suited for tougher forages, with thick enamel and conical premolars. 49 Similarly, because their natural diet is composed primarily of cactus, Chacoan peccaries have higher-crowned molars versus the lower-crowned molars of the other peccary species. 32, 49 Except for the babirusa, suids have a simple stomach. The stomach of the babirusa is bigger and has a large diverticulum. 22, 32, 35, 49 The pH in a large area of mucus-producing cardiac glands (5.3-6.4) is able to support microbial fermentation. 22, 23 Hence the babirusa is characterized as a nonruminant foregut fermenting frugivore and concentrate selector. [22] [23] [24] The ultrastructure of the babirusa stomach has been extensively studied. 23 ",

Hylochoerus, Potomachoerus sp., Sus scrofa, Sus barbatus, and possibly the warty pigs have been considered more frugivorous. 8, 24 The exact nutritional requirements of wild suids are not well-defined. 24 In general, diets fed to wild suids and peccaries in captivity consist of a complete pelleted herbivore ration, with varying amounts of fruits, vegetables, browse, and hay. A study evaluated the apparent digestibility of different macronutrients in warthogs, red river hogs, warty pigs, and babirusa. 8 No difference in protein digestibility was observed between the species, including peccaries when comparing with prior literature. Despite differences in gastric anatomy, neither peccaries nor babirusa had more efficient fiber digestion. Hemicellulose was digested more efficiently than cellulose by red river hogs, babirusas, and peccaries, whereas warthogs were capable of efficiently digesting both hemicellulose and cellulose. Therefore, dietary items high in hemicellulose would be appropriate for most wild suids, whereas incorporating items such as grass hays that have higher cellulose content would be appropriate for warthogs.",

Animals should be given access to mud wallows, where appropriate, and kept free from fecal and urine contamination. Nesting is a common behavior, and animals should be provided bedding materials for nesting. Other considerations for housing suids and peccaries include escape potential, substrate, and intraspecific aggression. Pigs are quite capable of either jumping (both vertically and horizontally) or digging their way out of an enclosure if given the opportunity. Substrate should not be abrasive as running, pacing, or both may cause excessive hoof wear, and enclosures should be evaluated for other potential sources of foot trauma.

Some individual animals will remain very flighty in captivity, whereas others become quite tractable. Operant conditioning in these animals may facilitate close visual inspection and limited palpation. Some animals go into lateral recumbency when scratched with a broom or scrub brush.

Peccaries generally do not have large subcutaneous fat reserves. 14,32 Some animals may become quite excited during immobilization. Although exotic species do not have the genetic defect that causes malignant hyperthermia in domestic swine, they are quite susceptible to hyperthermia because of their inability to sweat and the likelihood of extreme muscle exertion during an immobilization, especially in escape scenarios. 27 Excessive running, lengthy inductions, and violent recoveries are also risk factors for exertional myopathy. Foot trauma may also occur with excessive running on hard surfaces. When darting an animal in a group, precautions need to be taken to avoid causing trauma to conspecifics. In addition to remote delivery via dart systems, squeeze chutes or crates may be used for hand injections.

If a stylet is used, precautions need to be taken so to avoid trauma to the larynx. Once within the larynx, the endotracheal tube should be rotated 180 degrees to reach the tracheal opening. Threading an endoscope through the endotracheal tube may facilitate passage into the trachea. Laryngospasm may also complicate intubation. The use of benzodiazepines has been noted to significantly reduce jaw tone, which may facilitate easier intubation.

The saphenous vein in peccaries is prominent as it courses over the cranial aspect of the proximal tibia and is easily accessed. 25 For low-volume infusions, the aural vein, if present, may be catheterized. Catheters may also be placed in the cephalic and saphenous veins; however, a blind stick may be necessary, as the veins are not always visible.

Males actively court females. Females develop vulvar swelling and urinate frequently when in estrus. The uterine horns of the warthog and babirusa are reported to be smaller than those in other suid species, and this is attributed to be the reason for their smaller litters. 49 Peccary uterine horns are shorter than those of suids. 14 The penis is curved in a sigmoid shape, and the ends have a corkscrew appearance, correlating with the shape of the cervix. 49 A summary of reproductive parameters for select species are summarized in Table 58-9 . Fecal hormones to characterize reproductive biology were evaluated in red river hogs, babirusas, and warthogs. 3 Researchers found that estrus cycles could be monitored using 20 \u03b1-OHand 20-oxopregnane assays. In contrast, estrogens and androgens were not useful in characterizing follicular activity during estrus. The duration of the estrus cycle was approximately 35 days for all three species in this study. During the second half of pregnancy, estrogens and 17-oxo-androstanes were elevated.",

At the author' s institution, pregnant suids are vaccinated, where feasible, against colibacillosis. In captivity, promiscuous suckling has been observed in white-lipped peccaries but not in collared peccaries. 49 Most newborn piglets are not able to fully thermoregulate, so protection from the elements and supplemental heat are needed, depending on weather circumstances. Infanticide and cannibalism of young have been reported in pigs and peccaries and are not uncommon in exotic swine species in zoos as well. Neonatal mortality comprises a large proportion of swine and peccary mortality at the author' s institution. Trauma accounts for a majority of cases, followed by infectious etiologies. When the young start to sample solids, creep feeders may have to be provided to allow the young access to food without interference from adult animals.",
