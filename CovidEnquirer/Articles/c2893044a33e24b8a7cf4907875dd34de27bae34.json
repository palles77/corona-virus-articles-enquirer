For other diseases, such as those caused by influenza virus or hepatitis C virus, treatments are suboptimal and effective for only a subset of the population. Reductionist or structure-based drug design efforts rely on de novo predictions of how a select set of small molecules or compounds will interact with targeted pathogen or host proteins. Such predictions are typically difficult, time consuming, and costly. Additional approaches are needed to discover new treatments and to improve on existing ones. One promising approach is drug repurposing or repositioning; that is, applying known drugs or compounds to new indications [1, 2] . Although this idea is not new, past techniques have relied on hypothesis-driven approaches that usually involve computational matching of compounds to specific viral or human proteins, requiring a large amount of expert knowledge on the chemical compound and drug target under study.",

Instead, these approaches use the methods of systems biology and bioinformatics to directly compare the host response to pathogen and drug. The computational methods used in this paradigm vary in complexity from genomic signature comparisons to complicated interaction networks. In combination with systematic databases of drug-induced gene expression profiles, these methods utilize data from a variety of high-throughput techniques (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, or metabolomics), thus allowing for the identification of potential host drug targets on a global-scale ( Figure 1 ). Because of the significantly reduced timeframe for predicting host molecules for effective therapeutic intervention, and because these compounds are typically previously FDA-approved drugs or small molecules, these approaches have the potential to greatly reduce both the time and cost associated with drug development. Importantly, there has already been successful application of these approaches for several disease indications [3] .",

That is, the mRNA expression profiles contain information associated with higher-level protein interactions concordant with either the disease or drug treatment. Most examples of this approach use Connectivity Map (cMap) [7] , a public database (http://www.broadinstitute.org/ cmap/; version 2) that holds over 6000 transcriptome profiles established downstream of treatment of human cell lines with over 1300 compounds, most of which are FDA-approved drugs.

Two of the strongest anti-correlated treatment signatures were from prednisolone, a well-known treatment for Crohn's disease (a major type of IBD), and topiramate, an anticonvulsant drug used to treat epilepsy. Using a rodent model of IBD, it was shown that topiramate significantly reduced gross pathology and microscopic damage in the affected colon compared with that seen in control animals.

The majority of current antiviral drugs target specific viral proteins, making them narrow in spectrum and vulnerable to the emergence of viral resistance. Josset and co-workers reasoned that treating virus infection by stimulating or manipulating the innate immune response, or by targeting cellular factors required for the viral life cycle, would prove advantageous over the more traditional approach of targeting a viral protein. A common gene expression signature consisting of 20 dysregulated genes was identified from human A549 lung epithelial cells infected with human (H1N1 or H3N2) or avian (H5N1, H5N2, or H7N1) influenza A virus. The cMap database was then queried to identify candidate compounds with genomic signatures that were inversely correlated to the common influenza virus-induced host transcriptome profile. Eight candidate drugs were identified, the majority of which are approved for other indications. Six of these drugs inhibited viral growth in in vitro assays. Importantly, five out of the eight also inhibited the growth of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, which had not been used to define the common signature.",

MERS-CoV was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 and has since caused at least 77 confirmed infections resulting in 40 deaths. Using human Calu-3 cells (a cell line derived from epithelial cells lining the human conducting airway) and global transcriptional profiling of the host response, a 207-gene signature of the early host response was identified. Using this signature and two independent bioinformatics tools, the cMap connectivity score and IPA upstream regulator analysis (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com), two kinase inhibitors (SB203580 and LY294002) were identified as potential anti-MERS-CoV treatments. To validate the top predicted negative regulator, cells were treated with SB203580 before MERS-CoV infection. This resulted in a significant reduction in viral titers at both 24 and 48 hours post infection. This study demonstrates the potential of in silico approaches to predict drug candidates and the in vitro efficacy of SB203580 against MERS-CoV.",

Highly interconnected clusters that overlapped between the disease networks were then determined, and the use of a permutation test revealed a significant level of SNP enrichment (obtained from [20] ) in each core-susceptibility module compared with the whole protein-protein interaction network.",

As an example, Mei et al. [21] used a multiple-level network modeling (MLNM) approach to identify drugs to treat rare central nervous systems (CNS) diseases. Using publicly available disease-gene expression profiles, pathophysiological pathway analysis, and information on FDAapproved drugs and late-stage compounds, an integrated CNS disease network was constructed in which diseases were linked in relationship to the degree of commonly shared pathways, expression patterns, or responses to drugs or compounds. Using robust association statistical cutoffs, hierarchical clustering, and the hypothesis that similar diseases are caused by the dysregulation of related pathways, several potential drugs were identified. For example, these results predicted that Parkinson's disease drugs could be effectively repurposed as a therapy for basal ganglia disease. Similarly, this approach showed that multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (an autoimmune disorder consisting of simultaneous inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve and the spinal cord) share common mechanistic pathways, suggesting that MS drugs could be effective against both diseases.",

Using the resulting integrated drug-target-disease network, new links between drugs, targets, and diseases were identified and evaluated. For example, quercetin, a bioflavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [23] , and resveratrol (a polyphenolic compound found in red wine and once speculated to explain the 'French Paradox' [24] ) were predicted to bind the same two targets (PIK3GC and LTA4H, known binding partners of quercetin and resveratrol, respectively) and potentially be effective against neoplasms and cardiovascular diseases. A literature search revealed that quercetin binding to LTA4H had recently been verified using an in vitro pull-down assay. Although resveratrol does not appear to bind directly to PIK3GC, it can inhibit PIK3GC phosphorylation and has been reported to have anti-tumor activity [25] [26] [27] .",

However, there are also caveats to be aware of and steps to be taken to ensure that these approaches bear fruit. For instance, most if not all publicly available drug profiles have been obtained using cell lines as model systems, meaning that information related to intercellular mechanisms is not captured. Additional public funding is needed for more extensive databases that expand the number of drugs profiled and the model systems used. Equally important is the availability of datasets of the host response to infectious diseases. To this end, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has sponsored five systems biology centers for infectious disease research [28] . These centers focus on modeling the host response to pathogens such as influenza virus, SARS-CoV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia pestis, and most recently malaria parasites. The resulting host-response datasets, along with a significant amount of metadata, are captured by the NIAID Bioinformatics Resource Centers, thereby allowing investigators to use these extensive, systematically obtained genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic datasets for computational studies.",

With the recent US Supreme Court decision to ban patents on human genes, it is not hard to imagine that soon an individual's genetic makeup and personal genomic disease signatures will be screened against drug databases for a more tailored and personalized medical treatment. Finally, by identifying compounds that have already been evaluated in human subjects, drug repurposing approaches may be of particular benefit for identifying treatments that can be employed against rare or emerging infectious diseases. As an adjunct to the more common approaches of high-throughput screening and structure-based drug design, computational drug repurposing has the potential to rapidly translate insights gained through systems biology into a drug discovery strategy directly applicable to the treatment of infectious disease.",
