            "text": "Many pathogenic viruses can remain viable on human hands for hours. 1, 2 This gives hands the potential to spread such infectious agents directly or indirectly [3] [4] [5] in settings such as hospitals. 6, 7 Recent studies with experimentally contaminated fingertips have further substantiated the potential of hands to spread viruses. 8, 9 These observations reemphasize the need for proper hand disinfection in the prevention and control of nosocomial outbreaks of viral infections in particular. However, hand disinfectants are often tested against vegetative bacteria only and this may not reflect on their ability to deal with viruses. 10 While alcohol-based hand rubs generally have a broader and relatively rapid antimicrobial activity, they are often limited in their ability to inactivate non-enveloped viruses. 7 Raising the ethanol content may address this issue to some degree, but increases the risk of tissue toxicity 11 and lowers the flash point. At present, only one formulation with broad virucidal activity exists with an ethanol content of 95 vol%. Therefore, efforts were made to reduce the ethanol content without reducing the virucidal activity to decrease the flash point and increase skin tolerance and compliance. As a result of these efforts, a synergistic combination was developed with an ethanol content of 55% (w/w) in combination with 10% (w/w) propan-1-ol, 5.9% (w/w) propan-1.2-diol, 5.7% (w/w) butan-1.3-diol and 0.7% phosphoric acid. 12 This ready-to-use formulation is registered by the US Food and Drug Administration (NDC-6673-1230-(I)- (9) ). Since introduction of the evaluated product in Austrian hospitals, no relevant unwanted side-effects have been reported to date.",

Briefly, virus suspension, 2% serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), FCS, doubledistilled water and the hand disinfectant or the hand disinfectant dilutions were brought to 20 8C. One part of the virus suspension was mixed with either one part of double-distilled water, one part of the 2% serum albumin solution or one part of FCS. No protein load was added in the experiments with rotavirus, since FCS has rotavirus-inhibitory and trypsin-neutralizing activity. Then, eight parts of the formulation were added to each preparation. The mixtures were kept at 20 8C (in a water bath) for the exposure period. At the end of the exposure period, 10-fold serial dilutions of the control and test samples were prepared immediately in ice-cold culture medium (0.5 mL sample C4.5 mL medium), inoculated into respective host cells in suspension, placed in 96-well microtitre plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA), and incubated at 37 8C. Six or eight wells per sample dilution were inoculated. Virus control preparations contained identical protein concentrations. The cytopathic effect was recorded microscopically, and infectious virus titre in CCID 50 was evaluated by the endpoint dilution method of Reed and Muench. 16 The log 10 of the reduction factor, hereafter called the reduction factor (RF), was determined by subtracting the logarithmic titre CCID 50 at any test point from the logarithmic titre CCID 50 of the virus control. The 95% confidence limits of the reduction factors were obtained according to the EMEA guideline. 17 In this quantitative suspension test, a disinfectant solution was considered to have virucidal efficacy if, within the tested exposure period, the titre was reduced at least 10 4 -fold (RFZ4, inactivation 99.99%). This does not mean that an RF of 4 is regarded as sufficient for practical purposes. However, in general, the virucidal efficacy can not be followed over a titre range of more than 10 4 -fold due to the cytotoxicity of the substances tested. In fingerpad methods, the efficacy of a hand disinfectant has to be considered by comparison with a selected reference.",

The dried inoculum was then exposed to 1 mL of the reference [70% (v/v) ethanol, 70% (v/v) propan-1-ol and 60% (v/v) propan-2-ol] or standard hard water (SHW) or test formulation contained in a glass vial (Serolab, Aidenbach, Germany).

For poliovirus testing, tests without soil load were performed, whereas for FCV, a tripartite soil load according to E-1838-02 with bovine serum albumin, mucin and tryptone was included. Virus remaining on fingerpads was eluted with 1 mL Earle's balanced salt solution containing 1% tryptone (FCV without tryptone). Afterwards, virus titre in the eluate was determined directly by endpoint titration (poliovirus titration with GMK-AH 1 cells, FCV titration with KE-R cells) in microtitre plates. The calculation of virus titre for the fingerpad method was performed by the methods of Spearman 20 and K\u00e4rber. 21 Three controls were included to determine: (1) the amount of infectious virus in the inoculum; (2) the infectious virus placed on the two thumbpads without drying; and (3) the infectious virus remaining on fingerpads after drying of the inoculum. The difference in infectious virus in the inoculum control and the dried virus control represents the loss in virus infectivity due to drying of the inoculum. The amount of infectious virus remaining after drying of the inoculum was used as the baseline to determine the extent of virus elimination after treatment with test product or references. We used four randomly selected fingerpads for treatment with test product and two for treatment with references.",
