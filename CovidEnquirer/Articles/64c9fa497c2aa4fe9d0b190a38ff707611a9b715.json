            "text": "Cities have been one of the most important areas of CO 2 emissions. It is increasingly important to research the effect of urbanization on CO 2 emissions, especially in large emerging and developing economies, due to the indispensable need for understanding the effect of urbanization on CO 2 emissions, evaluating carbon reduction tasks and providing the scientific basis for low-carbon urbanization. Utilizing a balanced panel dataset in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China, during the period of 2000e2010, this paper employed data envelopment analysis (DEA) window analysis and a spatial lag panel Tobit model to investigate the effect of urbanization on CO 2 emissions efficiency (the ratio of the target CO 2 emissions to the actual CO 2 emissions). The results show that the average CO 2 emissions efficiency was 0.959 in 2010, and CO 2 emissions efficiency ranged from 0.816 to 1 and exhibited spatial clustering in the region. The larger potential of CO 2 emissions reduction appeared in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou, indicating that more CO 2 emissions reduction tasks should be allocated to these two cities. Urbanization has negative effects on improving CO 2 emissions efficiency, and there is a U-curve relation between CO 2 emissions efficiency and urbanization, indicating that CO 2 emissions efficiency decreases at the early stage of urbanization, then increases when urbanization reach a high level. There is spatial spillover effect among the prefecture-level cities, suggesting that different prefecture-level governments should coordinate with each other to improve CO 2 emissions efficiency in the whole area. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita also plays a markedly positive role in improving CO 2 emissions efficiency. This research highlights the effect of urbanization on CO 2 emissions efficiency and the importance of improving CO 2 emissions efficiency in developing countries.",

Urbanization increases energy consumption and becomes one of the main contributors to CO 2 emissions. China has become the country with the highest CO 2 emissions since 2006 (Gregg et al., 2008) . Urbanization level in China increased rapidly from 35.87% in 2000 to 55.61% in 2015. It has exceeded the world average since 2013 (World Bank, 2017) . Rapid urbanization has led to a shortage of resources and worsened environmental pollution (Yang et al., 2014) . In order to solve environmental problems, accelerating environmental protection and the construction of ecological civilization (e.g., reducing carbon emission) has been put forward since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China (Yang et al., 2013) . China's new urbanization plan (2014e2020) calls for the promotion of low carbon development as well as the adoption of low-carbon lifestyles and urban construction modes (Bai et al., 2014) . Chinese central government proposed to implement low-carbon urbanization, which attracted the attention of local governments and research scholars (Liu and Qin, 2016; Mittal et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015) .",

Charnes and Cooper (1985) combined the DEA with window analysis and proposed the DEA window analysis to estimate the dynamic effect of data. The fuzzy DEA model was proposed by Ignatius et al.

(2012) to calculate the efficiency and potential CO 2 emissions reduction (PCR) (the slack of CO 2 emissions) in China. The average PCR was 56.1 million tons in each province, and the CEE in eastern China is better than that in other regions in China.",

Due to the spatial variations in economic development and the source of carbon emissions inside the country or province, there is obvious spatial difference in CEE across its prefecture-level cities inside the country or province. And therefore, prefecture-level city data can provide more detailed information and make more accurate estimation, whereas national or provincial CEE analyses may have bias, at least due to the lack of spatial details. Meanwhile, many studies ignored the influence of spatial effect . They assumed that study units were independent, but each spatial unit can actually affect its neighbors by technical diffusion and industrial transfer. For instance, Zhou et al. (2017) applied a twostage DEA model to evaluate energy efficiency in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries from 1995 to 2013. The study found that the energy efficiency of developed countries was usually higher than those of developing countries. Liu et al. (2016a) utilized the SBM model to analyze CEE of Chinese provinces and found that the CEE of most Chinese provinces showed a downward trend from 2000 to 2011.",

Then, we analyze the relationship between urbanization and CEE. Finally, to take into account spatial spillover effect, a spatial lag panel Tobit model is constructed to analyze the impact of urbanization on CEE. The results are helpful for evaluating the carbon reduction task in the YRD, guiding policymakers to establish a plan to improve CEE, and providing a scientific basis for the development of low carbon urbanization.",

Since CEE values change between 0 and 1, the Tobit model is used (McDonald and Moffitt, 1980 ). The Tobit model has been widely used to investigate the influencing factors of environmental efficiency (Feng et al., 2017a; Lv et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2013) . The spatial spillover effect of CEE is the impact of some prefecture-level cities on their neighboring prefecture-level cities. The influences mainly derive from the demonstration effect in higher CEE prefecture-level cities through low-carbon technology diffusion and industrial transfer. Thus, a spatial lag model was constructed to take into account the spatial spillover effects of CEE. Meanwhile, this study explored whether there was environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for CEE and urbanization. Based on the above considerations, the model is as follows (Anselin, 1988; Feng et al., 2017a; Yuan et al., 2013) :",

Furthermore, since GDP per capita (GDPP) is an important influence on energy consumption and CO 2 emissions , GDPP is also found to be closely related to CEE (Yuan et al., 2013) . In addition, CEE may be affected by industrial structure and population density (Feng et al., 2017a; Yuan et al., 2013) . Secondary industry is the main source of CO 2 emissions, and it is more difficult to improve the CEE of secondary industry (Hao et al., 2015) . There is an uncertain relationship between population density and CEE. Liu et al. (2016b) suggested that higher population density may urge the government and population to pay more attention to the environment, and it may improve CEE.

CEE showed an obvious decreasing trend in 2004. This may be due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) which seriously influenced the economy in the YRD in 2003 and continued into 2004 (Zhong et al., 2003) . CEE exhibited a distinctly increasing trend from 2005 to 2010. This is because of the implementation of sustainable development policies which paid more attention to energy conservation, pollutant reduction and green development (Li and Lin, 2016) . In 2009, the Chinese government set a target to reduce carbon intensity to 40e45% of the 2005 level by 2020 (Qiu, 2009 ), and each prefecture-level government put more emphasis on reducing carbon emission. Meanwhile, the global financial crisis of 2008 seriously impacts China's economy. The central government accelerated the economic adjustment in the post-financial crisis period after 2008 and thus CEE significantly increased after 2009. CEE increased from 2005 to 2010, which does not mean that CO 2 emission decreased from 2005 to 2010. The reason is that GDP increased during this period and GDP growth was usually accompanied by the increase in total CO 2 emission. The Pearson correlation analysis indicates an insignificant negative relationship between CEE and urbanization (Table 3) .

The reason is that prefecture-level cities with high CEE have positive radiation driving effect on its neighbors. In addition, these neighboring cities improve their CEE by introducing low carbon technology from the prefecture-level cities, and these prefecture-level cities form the high CEE core. These prefecture-level cities should spread advanced low carbon technology to other regions and help other cities in their carbon reduction efforts . The prefecture-level cities including Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing fall into the Low-Low type, that may be due to their high energy-intensive and carbonintensive industries. Thus, these prefecture-level cities should adjust their industrial structure, introduce advanced low-carbon technology, and strengthen their cooperation with the High-High type prefecture-level cities. Meanwhile, local governments should provide more technology and financial aids to help improve their CEE. Fig. 5 shows bivariate cluster map for CEE and urbanization. In terms of the Low-High type of prefecture-level cities with low CEE, their nearby cities with high urbanization are more competitive compared to these cities with low CEE. Without sufficient capital and technology, it is difficult for cities with low CEE to further improve their CEE (Choi et al., 2012; Qin et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016b) . The High-Low type prefecture-level cities own advanced low-carbon technology and attract more high-quality resources from their neighboring cities with low urbanization level. Thus, these cities had high carbon emissions efficiency. For the prefecture-level cities of the High-High type, their nearby cities have a better radiation effect to these cities, and they can attract advanced low-carbon technology to improve their CEE. The PCR showed variation from 0 ton to 75.30 million tons in 2010 (Table A2 ). According to the PCR, different CO 2 emission reduction tasks should be allocated to prefecture-level cities. Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are the two prefecture-level cities with the largest PCR because their leading industries are still heavy industries that consume more energy and produce more carbon emissions. Thus, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are the key location for reducing CO 2 emissions. More CO 2 emission reduction tasks should be allocated to these two cities. In the future, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou should promote the adjustment of their industrial structure and technological innovation. Meanwhile, measures are needed to introduce advanced low-carbon technologies and strengthen interregional cooperation (Zhang et al., 2016a) .",

According to the disparities of PCR, different CO 2 emission tasks should be allocated to cities. Second, our results found both economic development and urbanization level had marked effects on CEE, and therefore low-carbon urbanization should be emphasized by controlling the improper urbanization speed, optimizing the spatial layout and making full use of infrastructure.
