These changing mobilities necessitate a reconceptualisation of the border as a series of potentially vulnerable nodes occurring within, and extending beyond, national boundaries. In this paper, we consider the border through the lens of port health, the collective term for various sanitary operations enacted at international transport terminals. In the UK, a critical player in the oversight of port health is the Health Protection Agency (HPA), which became a non-Departmental public body in 2005. A major part of port health is preparedness, a set of techniques aimed at managing, and responding to, emergencies of public health concern. More recently, certain jurisdictions have embarked on public health preparedness work across a number of different geographical scales. Using methods pioneered by the military, this form of 'distributed preparedness' is of increased interest to social science and medical scholars. With reference to case studies conducted in localities surrounding two UK regional airports following the 2009e10 H1N1 influenza pandemic, we consider the extent to which distributed preparedness as a concept and a set of practices can inform current debates -in the UK, and beyondconcerning interventions at the border 'within'.",

Scholars have long considered international air, rail and sea ports as potential sites of entry for threats to human health (Gushulak & MacPherson, 2000; Katz, Staiti, & McKenzie, 2006; Meyers, 1981) . However, recent transformations of individual mobility brought about by more diffuse air travel have highlighted the existence of multiple 'borders within' states through which an infectious disease may enter or leave a country (Budd, Bell, & Warren, 2011 ). An emerging literature considers the concept of 'preparedness' (Collier & Lakoff, 2008; Ingram, 2009) , which e unlike other anticipatory actions such as pre-emption and precaution e aims to stop the effects of an event from 'disrupting the circulations and interdependencies that make up a valued life' (Anderson, 2010: 15) . In the United States (US), Collier and Lakoff have drawn attention to the development of 'distributed preparedness', an 'organizational framework and set of techniques for approaching security threats' across a number of geographical scales (2008: 7). The practices associated with it include: the coordination of planning and response interventions across a number of public and private actors; mapping the vulnerability of vital systems to a potentially catastrophic event; and the use of scenarios to test joint working amongst local, regional and national agencies.",

We focus on the airport as a key node for entry and exit, and examine the concept of distributed preparedness as a series of measures put in place to enable the management of changing patterns of infectious disease spread. The paper builds on international research from the social sciences and epidemiology, and makes reference to official, 'grey', literature, to conduct an empirical examination of distributed preparedness interventions in geographical locations surrounding selected international airports in the UK. We draw on in-depth interviews conducted with emergency planners, environmental health officers and healthcare practitioners employed by airports, local authorities, Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) and Health Protection Units (HPUs) in order to analyse the multi-agency interactions that were in play during the 2009e2010 H1N1 pandemic influenza outbreak. In conclusion, we highlight three ways in which our empirical research develops conceptions of distributed preparedness to inform the management of an emerging infectious disease outbreak at the 'borders within' the UK.",

            "text": "Progressive liberalisation of the European air transport sector during the last two decades has resulted in a dramatic increase in international air traffic in the UK, particularly at smaller regional airports that historically handled few (if any) international flights (Budd et al., 2011) . In Europe, a series of measures, beginning in the early 1990s, allowed new airlines to enter the marketplace and airport operators to engage in more effective competition. The reforms dissolved traditional bilateral and multilateral air service agreements that specified which airlines could fly individual routes, the frequency with which the services could operate, the airports that could be served, and the airfares that could be charged (Goetz & Graham, 2004) . One, arguably unintended, consequence of the sudden 'opening up' of regional airports in Europe (Maertens, 2010) to regular long-haul services has been the dramatic increase in the number of sites through which potentially infected travellers and unwanted pathogens can enter or leave a country. In 1990, fewer than 100 scheduled international destinations were served from UK regional airports, but by 2010 the figure had increased to over 450, with particularly significant growth occurring at Liverpool, Bristol and East Midlands (CAA, 2011) . While the majority of international flights at UK regional airports are short-haul European services, many of these airports e crucially, from a public health perspective -also now support a significant number of longhaul 'spoke', or feeder, services to airports in the eastern United States, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent (Budd et al., 2011) . These services, combined with the growing number of transfer passengers they carry, have significant implications for public health provision and border control in the UK by both compounding and also obfuscating the geographical complexities of individual journeys. We argue that this has fundamentally altered the spatiality of Port Health provision in the UK and exacerbated the challenges of discharging effective health security safeguards at every new point of entry in the UK.",

Indeed, there has been a dedicated Health Control Unit at London Heathrow since 1947 to handle the health risks posed by international aeromobility. Moreover, considerable scholarly work evaluates the role of air travel in the spread of infectious disease (Ali & Keil, 2006; Gerard, 2002; Warren, Bell, & Budd, 2010) . The threat posed to a nation's health by global infectious disease has been widely theorised as 'biosecurity', a concept given to various technical and political efforts that aim to safeguard human, animal and plant health (for example, Hinchcliffe & Bingham, 2008 ). Yet, although such academic work has sought to understand the various forms of expertise and practices through which particular disease threats are identified, articulated, and managed, there has arguably been less focus on the preparations undertaken to manage the spread of human pathogens in the localities surrounding airports and the social relationships that result from this process. We contend that contemporary disease preparedness, which increasingly involves the study of individual airline passengers' mobility, is creating new geographies of containment and control which often begin before a passenger enters an airport and continue long after their arrival at their final destination (Warren et al., 2010) .",

Whilst the study of sanitary control at geopolitical borders is important, we wish to consider preparedness practices resulting from significant spatial realignments within the UK following the liberalisation of the European aviation industry, and the implications for the social and professional relationships within and between the affected organisations. Borders are increasingly being extended to nodes within national territories beyond the major international airports and, of particular significance to this paper, they are entering the localities within which these airports are situated.",

Building on this statement, we focus on 'new' international airports 'within', as sites exposed to infectious disease threats. Increasingly, theoretical and empirical literature has identified the airport as a site in which mobile bodies can be mapped and through which infectious diseases may enter a country (Adey, 2009; St Michael's Hospital, 2009; Warren et al., 2010) . For example, the BIO.-DIASPORA project, undertaken by a team of Canadian researchers and medical practitioners, examined the airport as a point of vulnerability and as one which exposed the nation to infectious disease threats (St Michael's Hospital, 2009 ). Yet, although that study considered the extent to which public health preparedness may be strengthened to manage these threats, it gave little detail on the types of intervention to be enacted at these sites. Gaber, Goetsch, Diel, Doerr, and Gottschalk (2009) have developed detailed guidelines for entry and exit screening at international airports, arguing that infectious disease transmission is more likely to occur at the airport before or after, rather than during, the flight. Therefore, a flexible approach is required in relation to community mitigation measures, corresponding to 'specific characteristics of individual biological agents' (Gaber et al., 2009: 595) . According to Dickmann et al. (2011) , risk communication forms an integral part of these interventions. In particular, attention should be paid to the provision of information to inbound and outbound passengers and to airport staff, taking account of their different needs (Dickmann et al., 2011) .",

To achieve this, we draw on the concept of distributed preparedness, examining recent UK initiatives aimed at improving local interventions during a particular event -the 2009e10 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Distributed preparedness considers preparedness interventions enacted across a number of geographical scales within a state's territory. The majority of work in this field has been conducted in the US, where distributed preparedness has been described as 'the development of an organizational framework and set of techniques for approaching security threats' (Collier & Lakoff, 2008: 7) . Its antecedents are located in the broader post World War Two civil defence planning, where it was developed to counter the possibility of nuclear attack. In this context, it 'presented a new model of coordinated planning for catastrophic threats', with a spatial focus on interventions utilising resources and infrastructure situated in the locality, as well as nationally (Collier & Lakoff, 2008: 7, 11) . In recent decades, distributed preparedness work has broadened to consider domains such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, financial regulation and pandemic influenza (Collier & Lakoff, 2008; Thompson, 2010) .",

            "text": "Although the system of governance in the UK clearly differs from that of the US, we argue that the distributed preparedness concept is instructive in the context of recent epidemiological and political developments. The former comprise not only the H1N1 pandemic, but also outbreaks of SARS and H5N1 avian influenza earlier in the decade. These disease occurrences focused attention on measures enacted in specific localities against pathogens that could enter the country at multiple sites and the extent to which communities could prepare for 'biological 'unknown unknowns'' which may appear from anywhere and could have potentially catastrophic effects (Braun, 2007: 18) . Political developments include contentious reforms of UK healthcare provision by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat administration which took office in May 2010. Although the scale, and pace, of implementation of these measures has been reduced following a public consultation during AprileJune 2011, the changes will result in the abolition of the HPA in April 2013 and the transfer of its functions to the Department of Health (DH). Moreover, from April 2013, primary healthcare provision will be devolved to GP-led clusters, with current PCTs ceasing to exist (DH, 2011) . This raises key questions over the location and nature of responsibility for the assessment and preparation of emergency response. In the UK, there has been a dearth of scholarly research into distributed preparedness measures enacted by civil authorities including airports, HPUs, local authorities and PCTs. This matters as their work came under considerable scrutiny in national and regional news outlets, and epidemiological journals, during the early weeks of the 2009e2010 H1N1 pandemic (Warren et al., 2010) . In this paper, we contend that the distributed preparedness practices of these organisations have affected conceptions of the border 'within', defining it as a geographically contested area. Our evidence is based on analysis of the relations between these organisations at multiple sites across national, regional and local scales.",

The empirical data presented in this paper was obtained from 18 participants.

However, the geographical areas for which these organisations were responsible varied enormously, with the HPU having both rural and urban PCTs and over 10 local authorities within its border. In the localities, interviewees in the organisations surrounding Airport A were particularly conscious of their port health duties and were keen to detail the efforts they had made to develop a coordinated approach within their locality. For instance, the HPU Port Health Lead in this case study area had established 'two or three years ago' a port health meeting, held every 12 weeks. Attendants at this forum discussed 'normal' (i.e. non-emergency) port health functions, for example, '.assessing the structures and partnerships in place, the funding available, how they had operated in the past, how they were going to operate in the future' (HPU, Port Health Lead) This meeting replaced an informal network where people 'spoke to each other' but there had been, significantly, 'no formally appointed medical officers in place'. They had progressed to a situation where Airport A had continuous PMO cover. The revised system had been tested by three incidents, two involving children with rashes ('suspected chickenpox') and the third concerning an adult passenger who appeared to be 'quite drowsy' and 'unresponsive'. In these cases, standard procedure involved the airline pilot radioing in to the airport Terminal Duty Manager, who in turn telephoned the HPU, using a specific contact number. This system of a single point of contact at each port -a recommendation of the 2005 Review -had been in place in case study A for 'two, maybe three' years. Only one of the three incidents (the first suspected chickenpox call) resulted in a direct intervention at the airport, a 'high level' response which the interviewee implied was unnecessary and, ostensibly, due to the 'inexperience' of the HPU practitioner who took the call. This view on the general robustness of port health procedures in the particular locality was shared, to varying degrees, by the partner organisations interviewed. Airport A and the neighbouring LA were trenchant in their support for the port health measures. At the same time, a Deputy Director based at the PCT in direct contact with Airport A stated that, whilst his organisation 'did not have formal responsibility for port health', it would be 'as helpful as it can' during port health incidents, providing 'surge capacity when necessary' in the form of additional staff, including district nurses. The provision of relief staffing was perceived by the interviewee to be one of the significant port health challenges faced by the PCT.",

It was perhaps as a consequence of this that there appeared to be less understanding amongst interviewees of the port health procedural set-up in this locality. Whilst interviewees at one PCT within the locality were clear that port health was the HPU's role, they openly admitted that as an organisation they were 'not fully aware of where [their] responsibilities lie' in this area.

The HPU Port Health Lead for case study area B reported that there was 'very little' going on in the locality in terms of port health, cautioning, somewhat surprisingly, that their organisation only served one 'small' airport.

Some localities within the UK were disease 'hot-spots' whilst others were 'largely unaffected' (Hine, 2010: 48) . As the pandemic was believed to have entered the UK via Birmingham International Airport, considerable media attention was focused in the early weeks of the outbreak at regional airports (Warren et al., 2010) . Interviewees at both airports reported that the multi-agency meetings -with local authorities, HPUs, Ambulance Services, UK Border Agency, PCTs and Acute Trusts -during this critical period were, in words of one Senior Manager, 'very useful'. Within case study A, the relationship between airport and HPU appeared to be particularly close, with the same Senior Manager stating 'the liaison was very good, we've got contacts if we need them'. The HPU's role with regard to this airport was education (for example, delivering a presentation on the pandemic 'in layman's terms, and answering airport queries') and informative (providing leaflets to be given to passengers). Yet, by July 2009 this activity had, according to a Senior Manager at Airport A, 'faded a lot':",

These nodes have emerged following air travel liberalisation, as regional airports -across the globe -increasingly host international flights (Maertens, 2010) . We argue that these transformations in international passenger air travel have significant implications for the geographies of public health preparedness. Moreover, these changing patterns of aeromobility have been complicated by UK government reforms, including the proposed devolution of many of the PCT functions to multiple GPled consortia and the absorption of the work of the HPA into the DH.

These tensions found expression in a degree of territoriality between agencies over their preparedness remits, where good practice required greater joint working and regular interactions between key players during 'normal' times. Among some agencies, there was uncertainty over port health responsibilities, whilst specific actors were unwilling to compromise on what they interpreted as their professional roles. For example, the PCT in case study B appeared unsure about the actions it should take in the event of an infectious disease entering its locality via the airport. During the H1N1 pandemic, this perceived lack of effective formalised organisational port health procedures resulted in localised disputes over the extent to which the PCT should provide nursing assistance to allow the HPU to conduct patient swabbing. In case study A, the tensions were less overt. Nevertheless, the HPU Port Health Lead for this locality, stated that their organisation felt the need to shoulder the burden during the early weeks of the H1N1 outbreak: 'when this hit, [the PCT] weren't ready to mobilise their resources, and we stepped in.'.",

There was evidence, nevertheless, of territorial competition between central and local control. Preparedness plans made at the local scale, for example by a PCT, frequently fed into multi-agency plans covering a larger geographical area, often a county or group of counties. This work directly linked to central government guidance, for example, the DH's National Framework. Conceptually, these proposed interventions, involving a number of agencies, were 'distributed' across various scales, from the town hall to government department. However, when the H1N1 influenza pandemic occurred, this approach was not put into practice. Instead, there appeared to be a lack of coordinated risk communication across agencies. In spite of the local and regional plans, central government e most notably the DH e took charge at a very early stage. Agencies operating at a local level variously described the 'tearing up' of local plans and the 'changing [of] rules' (Risk Manager, PCT, case study B). It was an approach that appeared to be antithetical to the changing nature of the UK border and the uneven geographical spread of the virus across the UK, identified in the Hine Report (Hine, 2010) . Whilst tensions between health policy formulations across geographical scales has been discussed elsewhere (McLafferty, 2010) , our empirical study captured the temporal changes, as a national government sought to exercise control from the 'centre' during a period of 'crisis' (Anderson, 2009) . Moreover, central government plans to administer directly the HPA's health protection role suggested that much work is required if distributed preparedness interventions are to be enacted during the next pandemic.",

            "text": "Third, we found that representations of the regional airport as a significant international border through which tens of thousands of non-EEA travellers enter the UK each year (CAA, 2011) did not register with the majority of participants operating within the communities surrounding this bounded geographical area. The Director of the HPU in case study B referred to the airport within its boundaries, which handled in excess of 500,000 non-EEA passengers a year, as 'small' ('it's not Heathrow'). Participants from other organisations also appeared to downplay the significance of the airport as a point of entry for disease, referring to the low number of port health cases identified each year and the general ineffectiveness of mass, pre-emptive screening processes. Whilst reaction to the latter is understandable, in view of contentious screening interventions aimed at identifying diseases in the UK (tuberculosis) and in Canada and parts of Asia (SARS) (Ali & Keil, 2006; HPA, 2006) , it is nevertheless surprising, given the means by which H1N1 Influenza was deemed to have entered the UK. Following our investigation, and building on international studies on this topic (St Michael's Hospital, 2009 ), therefore, we call for a renewed focus on the regional airport (and on the origin of journey of international passengers), with a view to improving port health provision, both at the airport and within the surrounding community. This would help inform debates in other countries where international airports located outside of global cities have proved to be nodes for virus transfer. It was notable, for example, that the global spread of H1N1 during 2009e2010 was facilitated as much through 'resort' and regional airports (Cancun, Mexico and Birmingham, UK, respectively) as via major international sites (Chang et al., 2010) . In order to be effective, any future preparedness interventions need to, in our view, pay greater attention to the bounded, and contested, geographies in which agencies serving these localities operate. Moreover, they need to take greater account of the specific requirements of aviation and note the industry relevant guidance from international agencies such as the WHO, ICAO and ACI. A more nuanced understanding of the tensions between local and national policy formulations in practice may result in more coordinated national e and transnational -approaches to 'distributed preparedness'.",
