Relatively little research activity however, is directed toward the study of bacteria. The cumulative Index Veterinarius for 1982 had no entries under monoclonal antibodies, while the 1983 edition had 69. Most entries dealt with viral antigens and identifiction of eukaryotic cell surface markers. Only three papers dealt specifically with bacterial antigens. In the 1984 edition, 7 of 71 monoclonal antibody citations involved bacteria, while in 1985, 22 of 102 entries dealt specifically with bacteria. In view of the scarcity of published material, the emphasis in this chapter on current and future applications of monoclonal antibodies in veterinary medicine will out of necessity deal largely with future uses.",

The focus of this presentation will be primarily on diagnostic and clinical applications, acknowledging from the outset that advances in these areas depend critically on advances in basic research on the structure and function of bacterial pathogens. The recent development of a monoclonal antibody to the K99 pilus of enteropathogenic E. coli for passive immunization of calves against enteric colibacillosis (127) was only possible because the development of hybridoma technology was preceded by years of basic research by numerous workers on the identification of adherence factors on enteric bacteria and their role in the pathogenesis of diarrhea (34) . The antigenic structures, virulence attributes, and pathogenic mechanisms of many important bacterial pathogens in veterinary medicine are still uncharacterized. Now that hybridoma technology is readily available as a research tool, monoclonal antibodies will undoubtedly aid in first defining these unknowns and then providing new diagnostic and clinical applications.",

            "text": "There are certain limitations in the practice of veterinary medicine which make the potential diagnostic and clinical uses of monoclonal antibodies very attractive. The food animal practitioner must often carry out a thorough clinical examination and diagnostic workup in the isolation of a barn or feedlot, arrive at a specific diagnosis, and institute a therapeutic plan, all in a single farm visit. When an entire herd or flock is threatened with the spread of a rapidly disseminated infectious disease, this process takes on some urgency and the accuracy of the diagnosis becomes extremely important. Submission of samples to a distant diagnostic laboratory can be impractical. The development of rapid, reliable immunodiagnostic test kits for use on the farm is a recognized need. Certain immunodiagnostic procedures, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), are adaptable for on-farm or in-practice use, and the inclusion of monoclonal antibodies as reagents in these kits will greatly enhance their practicality. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies would allow diagnostic tests to be performed directly on crude specimens such as feces, pus, mastitic milk, and trach\u00e9al lavage fluid without the intermediate step of bacterial culture (26) . Furthermore, these monospecific reagents virtually eliminate the problems of cross-reactivity which can occur with conventionally derived polyclonal reagents. Specific diseases in which such diagnostic capability would be advantageous to the practitioner will be discussed.",

            "text": "A clinical application with tremendous potential in veterinary medicine is disease prevention by passive immunization, particularly when a newly initiated infection threatens to spread rapidly through a susceptible herd or flock. In many situations, numerous extrinsic factors play a role in the initiation and spread oi bacterial disease. These factors include weather conditions, concurrent vira infections, sanitation, nutritional status, stress factors, stocking rates, ventila tion, and recent transport (12) . Disease outbreaks are often explosive and unpre dictable. In many cases, active immunization with vaccines has not been under taken because disease outbreaks were unexpected, efficacious vaccines are no available, or the cost-benefit ratio of prophylaxis was not considered. In situa tions such as these, the practitioner currently must intervene with antibioti\u00ab therapy in an effort to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, the use of antibiotic therapy in food-producing animals is coming under increasing scrutiny due to concern about transfer of drug resistance from animal to human pathogens (55) . Intervention with parenteral administration of monoclonal antibodies directed against specific virulence factors of the pathogens involved in order to reduce morbidity offers an attractive alternative to antibiotic therapy. As the knowledge of virulence factors in bacterial pathogens increases, more disease outbreaks will undoubtedly be handled in this way. Specific disease entities where this approach is currently being employed as well as diseases in which such intervention is likely to be successful will be discussed in detail.",

They are also known as fimbriae, adhesins, adherence factors, or colonizing factors. The role of pili in enabling certain pathogens to colonize epithelial surfaces successfully is well established. In human medicine, pili have been recognized as virulence factors in infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (107) , enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (27) , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (161) , among others. In veterinary medicine, the importance of pilus-mediated adherence has also been identified in EPEC infections causing neonatal enteric colibacillosis of calves, lambs, and pigs (12, 34) , Moraxella bovis infections causing infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK; pinkeye) (113) , and Bacteroides nodosus infections causing foot rot of sheep (145) . A role for pilus-mediated adherence is being investigated for a number of other important veterinary pathogens including various Salmonella (88) , Pasteurella (40), and Bordetella (41) species. This knowledge has led to the development of pilusenriched vaccines for active immunization against some of these pathogens (2, 61, 91, 94, 99, 100, 121, 145, 160) . In the case of the enteropathogenic E. coli, monoclonal antibodies have been developed for diagnostic use as well as for passive immunization of newborn calves and pigs (122, 127, 159) . These developments as well as potential applications of monoclonal antibodies for control of pinkeye, foot rot, and other pilus-mediated infections in veterinary medicine will be discussed.",

The development of a monoclonal antibody against the K99 pilus of EPEC for passive protection of newborn calves against fatal enteric colibacillosis (127) is illustrative of how firm knowledge of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of a specific disease can lead to innovative methods of disease control. Strains of noninvasive E. coli capable of producing diarrhea in noenates must possess two virulence factors, both of which are plasmid mediated (44, 93) . First, they must be enterotoxigenic, possessing either heat-stable or heat-labile enterotoxin capable of inducing hypers\u00e9cr\u00e9tion by villous epithelial cells. Second, they must possess pili to colonize the gut successfully by adherence to the villous epithelium. The physical proximity of the bacteria to the villous surface, facilitated by pilus adherence, maximizes the deleterious effects of the enterotoxin. Nonpiliated enterotoxigenic strains and piliated nonenterotoxigenic strains cannot produce disease of equal magnitude to the enteropathogenic strains which possess both pilus and toxin.",

Isolation of the pilus can be accomplished with either a salt extraction procedure, ultrasonication, or mechanically, by heating and shaking of a cell suspension. Early reports on the structure of the K99 pilus suggested that it was composed of two protein subunits, a major component of MW 22,500 and a minor subunit of MW 29,500 (59) . More recent work indicates that the pilus is composed of only a single subunit of MW 18, 400 (19) .

These species become resistant to experimental challenge after 2 days of age, as has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro (117, 136) . Although the nature of this natural resistance is not well understood, the clinical significance of this observation was profound. It led to the hypothesis that if susceptibility to enteric colibacillosis occurs only in the first few days of life, the presence of K99-specific antibody in the gut lumen during that time might successfully block intestinal adherence by K99-positive EPEC, thus inhibiting colonization until such time that the calf possessed natural resistance to infection (2) . In livestock species, maternal antibodies are derived from colostral ingestion rather than by transplacental transfer (83) . Experiments were undertaken to demonstrate whether cows vaccinated prepartum with killed bacterins containing either K99-positive strains of E. coli or purified K99 pili would produce and concentrate K99-specific antibodies in their colostrum. Calves ingesting this colostrum at birth would then be protected from enteric colibacillosis. This hypothesis was proven repeatedly to be accurate in experimental challenge studies (2, 47, 99) . As a result, numerous vaccines have become commercially available for active immunization of the cow for passive protection of the calf. The history of vaccine development in enteric colibacillosis of calves has recently been reviewed (46) .",

Pregnant cows must be handled for vaccination twice during the first year and once during each subsequent year of the vaccination program (48) . Some livestock owners are reluctant to accept the cost and inconvenience of preventative vaccination unless they have recently experienced an outbreak of enteric colibacillosis in their herds. Such outbreaks are difficult to predict, since the epizootiology of neonatal calf diarrhea includes a variety of management and environmental factors. When outbreaks do occur suddenly in unvaccinated herds, it is too late to immunize actively those pregnant cows that are close to parturition. These concerns prompted investigation of an alternative method of passive immunization of newborn calves, namely, the oral administration of K99-specific hybridomaderived monoclonal antibody shortly after birth. The development of this K99specific monoclonal antibody and its effacacy in protecting calves against fatal enteric colibacillosis in challenge trials has been reported (127) . It represents the first known application of a monoclonal antibody for passive immunization against an important bacterial disease. The details of this work will be briefly reviewed.",

This finding supported the earlier work (2) which indicated that immunization of cows with purified K99 antigen before calving stimulated their production of K99-specific antibodies which were passively transferred to their calves and which prevented fatal diarrhea. In this study, antibody directed only against the K99 pilus of EPEC significantly reduced the severity of diarrhea caused by strain B44, which carries two adherence pili (K99 and F41), as well as the K30 capsular antigen, which is also believed to mediate adherence (98) . This suggests that the degree of colonization and, hence, the clinical severity of disease, was reduced by the K99-specific monoclonal antibody. The fact that diarrhea was not eliminated completely was attributed to the possibility that either performed enterotoxin was present in the challenge inoculum, that the dose of monoclonal antibody was not sufficient to block adherence by K99 pili completely, or that F41-mediated adherence with some colonization of the gut may have occurred. The fact that 29% of treated calves died was attributed to several factors, including the deprivation of colostrum in trials 2 and 3, and the presence of concurrent infections. Postmortem examination in some treated calves revealed the presence of concurrent rotavirus and/or coronavirus in the intestine.",

In fact, a conventionally raised K99-specific antibody product for oral administration directly to calves has been developed and marketed in Israel (151) . However, hybridoma technology has advanced so dramatically since the first published report in 1975, that the cost of producing hybridomaderived monoclonal antibody compares favorably to the production of conventional antisera (C.

In a comparison with the conventional culture and agglutination technique, the diagnostic sensitivity of the ELIS A was equivalent to the standard test. However, overnight culture was eliminated and test results were available in 6 hr. The ELISA employed a rabbit-derived K99-specific antisera purified by adsorption of the hyperimmune serum with a K99-negative variant of the parent strain from which the pilus was first derived. To perform the ELISA, extensive processing of the fecal specimen was first required. Samples were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized by ultrasonication, and then centrifuged for clarification. Some cross-reactivity occurred when bovine coronavirus was present in the fecal specimens and required blocking with bovine anticoronavirus serum. Mills The technique requires no preparation of the fecal sample, yields results in less than an hour, and is designed as a test kit for use in the veterinary practice. The source of the monoclonal antibody is again clone 2BD4E4. A fecal swab or a 0.2-g sample of feces is suspended ina tube of diluent buffer by shaking. The K99-specific monoclonal antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase is added to the tube. A polystyrene wand coated with the K99-specific monoclonal antibody is then placed in the sample tube and incubated for 15 min. The wand is then washed in cold water and placed in a second tube containing the enzyme substrate. After 15 min, the color change is visually observed. A positive control is run with each sample as a color standard. Results are based on the concentration of pilus antigen in the sample and are read as negative (< 0.1 \u03bcg of K99 antigen), low positive (0.1-1.0 \u03bcg), or high positive (< 1 \u03bcg of K99 antigen). Due to the consistent concentration and avidity of the monoclonal reagents, the sensitivity of the test can be easily titrated to a desired level of sensitivity.",

The K88 antigen was first described in 1961 as a serologically distinct antigen associated with E. coli strains isolated from pigs with edema disease and neonatal enteritis (105) . It was later demonstrated that the K88 antigen was an adherence factor which facilitated colonization of the small intestine (6, 65, 158) . This was confirmed by several in vivo and in vitro studies wherein adherence of K88-positive EPEC to intestinal villous epithelium was blocked by antisera against the K88 antigen (65, 134, 138, 158) . Based on these findings, vaccine trials were carried out and demonstrated that sows vaccinated with K88-positive EPEC would produce high levels of colostral K88-specific antibody which would passively protect newborn suckling pigs from enteric disease produced by K88-positive EPEC (119, 120) . Numerous commercial vaccines are now available for immunization of sows to control K88-positive EPEC-induced enteritis in their offspring (157) . As was described in the case of enteric colibacillosis of calves due to K99positive EPEC, numerous epidemiologic factors contribute to the development of clinical disease, and in swine herds managed in confinement systems, neonatal colibacillosis can be unpredictable in onset and severe in nature (3) . Analogous to the situation in calves, in swine herds where active immunization of sows has not been carried out prior to an outbreak of piglet enteritis, morbidity and mortality might be reduced through passive immunization of newborn pigs by direct oral administration of K88-specific antibody. P. L. Sadowski (Molecular Genetics, Inc., Minnetonka, Minnesota, personal communication) has produced K88-specific monoclonal antibodies using techniques similar to those described earlier for the production of the K99-specific monoclonal antibody. Three distinct monoclonal antibodies have been produced, showing specificity for the a, b, and c antigenic determinants of the K88 antigen. The protective effects of both the a and c antibodies when administered orally to newborn pigs have been demonstrated in challenge trials using a K88ac-positive EPEC strain (122) .",

It appears that vaccination is exerting some selection pressure on EPEC, and that the organisms are responding with variation in their adherence structures (34) . Passive immunization of piglets with monoclonal antibodies could also potentially contribute to this selection pressure.

This has been substantiated in experimental infection where controlled exposure to ultraviolet light prior to challenge with M. bovis increases the rate and severity of infection. Lack of skin pigmentation in the eyelids of certain cattle breeds also predisposes to infection. Other corneal irritants such as dust can also increase susceptibility. When multiple predisposing factors are present, severe outbreaks of IBK can occur suddenly and spread rapidly, with the morbidity rate reported as high as 80%.",

In 1972, Pedersen et al. (108) demonstrated that only piliated strains of M. bovis were capable of colonizing the conjunctiva of calves and reproducing the disease. The presence of pili in virulent strains was associated with a distinctive flat, agar-corroding, colony morphology, and was confirmed by electron microscopy. Since that time, virtually all investigations into the pathogenesis of IBK have utilized piliated strains of M. bovis, and, as discussed below, advances in disease control are based on manipulating the immunological response of the host to the pilus. Pili, however, are not the only recognized virulence factors of M. bovis. It has been reported that production of hemolysin is also a characteristic of all strains capable of producing ocular disease (110) . A role for several other toxins and proteases has also been suggested (113) . However, as with the enteropathogenic E. coli, the pilus is of major importance as the prime mediator of colonization. If colonization is blocked, the deleterious effects of additional virulence factors may be minimized.",

            "text": "Several lines of investigation suggest that a systemic humoral immune response may prevent infection with M. bovis. In field outbreaks of IBK, young cattle are more susceptible than adults, suggesting the development of a natural acquired immunity (57). Pugh et al. (112) have demonstrated that calves receiving colostrum from cows vaccinated with M. bovis are more resistant to experimental challenge than calves receiving colostrum from unvaccinated dams, when challenged with a homologous strain. It has also been demonstrated by Kopecky et al. (68) that calves experimentally infected in one eye subsequently develop less severe clinical disease when challenged in the other eye 21 days later. The conclusion drawn was that systemic rather than local immune responses were responsible for limiting disease. Several investigators have measured antibody responses in the serum and lacrimal secretions of infected calves. Killinger et al. (66) reported that in lacrimal secretion the highest and most persistent antibody titers specific for M. bovis were of the IgG class despite the fact that, in normal calves, Ig A is the predominant antibody class in lacrimal secretion. Weech and Renshaw (156) demonstrated that the M. bovis-specific antibody in lacrimal secretions was directed primarily against protein antigens, including pilus, rather than carbohydrate antigens. These investigators, however, were unable to detect a serum antibody response to infection. Bishop et al. (11) identified an M. \u00e8ovw-specific IgG response in the serum of challenged calves but primarily an Ig A response in lacrimal secretion. Despite the somewhat contradictory findings of these investigators, it is likely that a systemic humoral immune response is an important defense against infection with M. bovis. The apparent efficacy of parenteral vaccination supports this conclusion. 4 This vaccine is a formalin-killed, aluminum hydroxide-adjuvanted, whole-cell bacterin containing two highly piliated strains of M. bovis, EPP63 and FLA64. In experimental challenge trials (160) the vaccine given subcutaneously at a 28-day interval produced high circulating antibody titers to the pili of both strains, as measured by ELIS A, and substantially reduced the rate of infection in vaccinated calves as compared to challenged, un vaccinated controls. This vaccine is now being used widely in the field with apparent success, although the vaccine's ability to induce protection against heterologous field strains of M. bovis has not been reported.",

This region may show little structural variation because of the necessity of conserving receptor cell site binding specificity for successful colonization of the host. Preliminary work by G. K. Schoolnik (Stanford University, School of Medicine, Stanford, California, personal communication) has begun to clarify the pilus structure of M. bovis. Two distinct pili have been identified on M. bovis strain EPP63. They are provisionally designated as heavy and light with molecular weights of 18,000 and 17,000, respectively. The amino acid sequence of both proteins has been determined. The coding for these pili is chromosomal and not plasmid mediated, and the DNA sequence coding for the light pilus has been defined. Both the heavy and light pili share a common antigenic region of approximately 40 amino acids at the N-terminus. Serologie studies show this antigenic region to be immunorecessive. The remainders of both pili are antigenically heterologous, and this variable region is immunodominant. Several field isolates of M. bovis have also been demonstrated to possess pili of 18,000 and 17,000 MW, but identification of a common epitope has not yet been carried out.",

Beginning around 1970, reports of vaccine efficacy using piliated strains of B. nodosus in oil adjuvants were reported from Australia (22), New Zealand (132), and England (116) . A protective effect was observed, and the level of protection roughly correlated to serum pilus antibody titers. In virtually all these studies, protection was demonstrated primarily against homologous challenge strains. However, two vaccine trials carried out in the United States using an Australianproduced vaccine demonstrated poor protection (82, 140) . These failures prompted investigation into serotypic heterogeneity of virulent field strains (123) . It appears that pilus (K) antigens of B. nodosus are extremely variable. Several studies of K antigen diversity have been reported, and the number of identifiable serogroups has ranged from 3 in Australia (21) to 14 in the United States (123).

Clearly, hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibodies to pilus fragments would be far superior to conventionally prepared rabbit antibodies for the purpose of establishing the existence of common epitopes. Identification of a common immunogenic region is critical for the further development of a broadly efficacious pilus vaccine. In addition, the specificity of monoclonal antibodies could facilitate definition of the immunogenic and pathogenic role of other B. nodosus surface structures implicated as virulence factors.

As evidenced by the above discussions, attachment to epithelial cell surfaces is a critical first step in the pathogenesis of bacterial infection of mucosal surfaces, particularly when mechanical defenses such as peristalsis or ciliary activity resist colonization. Recognition of this fact has led researchers to a more careful evaluation of both fimbrial and nonfimbrial adherence factors as mediators of infectious disease in both human and veterinary medicine. This is particularly true in the study of respiratory pathogens. Respiratory tract disease continues to be one of the costliest disease entities encountered in veterinary practice. Significant economic loss occurs in the cattle, swine, and poultry industries due to respiratory infections, and trends toward confinement livestock rearing in all of these industry sectors exacerbate the spread of respiratory pathogens (9, 109, 166) .",

Adherence was considered to be a prerequisite for survival in the host organism, but the location and structure of the mycoplasmal adhesin was unknown. To answer these questions, mice were immunized with whole-cell suspensions of M. pneumoniae. Splenic lymphocytes were harvested and hybridomas produced. One hundred twenty hybridoma clones were screened for the production of adherence-inhibiting antibody using a hemadsorption assay. Through limiting dilution techniques, a single clone was isolated producing the desired antibody. Utilizing this monoclonal antibody in an indirect-immunofluorescence test on whole M. pneumoniae cells, a localized area of fluorescence was identified on one pole of the cell. Electron microscopic examination using ferritin-labeled antimouse monoclonal antibody confirmed that the monoclonal antibody was bound specifically to the unipolar tip structure of the organism (Fig. 3) .",

Observations that K88-positive EPEC isolates from naturally infected swine are less frequently of the K88ab type and more frequently of the K88ad type suggest that the pilus plasmid genome is responsive to selection pressure exerted by vaccination (34) . This could potentially impair the long-term efficacy of highly specific monoclonal antibodies directed against variable regions of the pilus. Enterotoxin-specific monoclonal antibody offers a possible alternative for continued passive immunization. A combination of LTand ST-specific antibodies could conceivably neutralize enterotoxins of all EPEC strains regardless of their current or future pilus specificity. The success of this strategy would depend on the inability of enterotoxin to escape immune recognition through structural variation mediated by the plasmid genome. Furthermore, if colonization is allowed to occur, the question arises of whether or not antibody can successfully bind and neutralize enterotoxins. The physically intimate association of the EPEC organism to the brush border of epithelial cells facilitated by adherence pili may present spatial constraints which limit antibody-enterotoxin interaction.",

Yet cattle vaccinated upon arrival cannot be expected to develop a strong humoral immune response within the first 2 weeks, if at all. Endogenous steroid release due to stress and concurrent viral infections may impair the animals' ability to mount an effective immune response, even with the best of vaccines.

The essential elements of the control program are restriction of cattle movement, s\u00e9rologie identification and destruction of infected animals, and vaccination of calves with a live avirulent B. abortus (strain 19) vaccine. Vaccination is an important component of the program. However, the production of antibodies in vaccinated animals as well as the occurrence of other organisms which induce cross-reactive antibodies, confound the accurate s\u00e9rologie diagnosis of naturally occurring brucellosis infection.

Monoclonal antibodies developed against strain-specific antigens could then be used in competitive s\u00e9rologie assays such as the competitiveinhibition assay described earlier for the diagnosis of tuberculosis, to discriminate natural B. abortus infections from both strain 19 vaccination and spontaneous infections with cross-reactive organisms. Several reports on the development of monoclonal antibodies against cell wall LPS antigens of Bruceila strains for s\u00e9rodiagnostic application have already appeared (54,125,125a) . The first work by Schurig (125) illustrated the use of monoclonal antibody to Brucella in a competitive ELISA test to discriminate antibody against E. coli LPS antigen from antibody to Brucella LPS antigen in sera from immunized animals. In another study (15) , a monoclonal antibody specific for the 'O\"-chain polysaccharide of Yersinia enterocolitica was found to agglutinate several biotypes of B. abortus. It was concluded that the \" A \" antigen of B. abortus is identical to the 4 \u038c\"-chain polysaccharide of Y. enterocolitica.",

This is particularly true on breeding farms and in training stables where there is a continual turnover of large numbers of horses. Contamination of the environment with purulent material from draining abscesses promotes the spread of disease, and in some facilities strangles becomes an endemic problem (12) . Young foals accompanying their mares to breeding farms are particularly susceptible. A commercial bacterin is available for vaccination against S. equi, but the degree of protection afforded by immunization is variable (25) .

This phenomenon appeared to be independent of antibody titer to type-specific antigens of infecting organisms. Ziegler et al.

(97) have recently produced four monoclonal antibodies against the J5 mutant of E. coli, all of which react with purified LPS from J5 E. coli, the Re 595 mutant of S. minnesota, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in addition to purified lipid A of P. aeruginosa. These antibodies also react in ELISA with outer membrane preparations of more than 30 strains of various Gram-negative bacteria while showing no reactivity against Gram-positive species. These results add credence to the concept of widespread conservation of single antigenic sites in the lipid A of diverse gram-negative bacteria and illustrate the power of monoclonal antibodies as investigative tools. A more recent report (87a) has shown that the cross reactivity of monoclonal antibodies against E. coli J5 endotoxin was even greater when the antibodies were reacted with whole heterologous organisms rather than the purified LPS extracts.",

In addition, antibody against core LPS could be used for passive immunization of patients at risk, such as burn patients or immunocompromised patients on chemotherapy, as well as for immunotherapy in the early stages of Gram-negative bacterial septicemia. Monoclonal antibody derived by hybridoma technology would be a logical method for producing therapeutic and prophylactic antibody. It obviates the problem of raising conventional antisera in human beings and would yield specific antibody in much higher concentration. The concentration of antibody administered for therapeutic purposes is probably a critical factor because, in overwhelming Gram-negative sepsis, antibody is rapidly consumed.",

These include, among others, colisepticemia in newborn calves, shigellosis in foals, agalactia of sows, salmonellosis of cattle and horses, postoperative endotoxemia in horses, and coliform mastitis in cattle.

Although many of the proposed applications presented in this chapter are speculative, the authors have attempted to limit discussion to bacterial diseases where existing knowledge of the antigenic structure, virulence mechanisms, and host responses to infection is sufficient to make such speculation realistic. Whenever possible, these potential applications have been supported by discussion of analogous developments in human medical research to lend credence to the speculations in veterinary medicine. Only additional research involving these specific veterinary pathogens will determine whether or not the potential applications we have hypothesized can be successfully implemented in practice. It is hoped that this chapter will encourage veterinary researchers to examine critically some of our proposed applications for monoclonal antibodies. Undoubtedly many additional practical applications for hybridoma technology in veterinary medicine have eluded our imagination, and interested readers are very likely to develop additional ideas of their own. If this occurs, then the chapter has served a useful purpose.",

            "text": "Passive immunization using monoclonal antibodies may dramatically alter traditional approaches to disease control in veterinary medicine. Several aspects of veterinary livestock practice underscore the need for effective passive immu-nizing agents. Livestock producers resist the idea of active immunization against infectious diseases even when efficacious vaccines are available. Much of this resistance is due to the economic realities of livestock production where profit margins are narrow and the cost of vaccination is weighed against the risk of experiencing disease outbreaks. Unfortunately, in many cases the risks are weighed incorrectly and the veterinarian is then called in to halt the rapid spread of infectious disease through a highly susceptible population of livestock. The value of passive immunization in these situations is unquestionable, as evidenced by the apparent success of the K99-specific monoclonal antibody in controlling outbreaks of fatal diarrhea in neonatal calves due to enteropathogenic E. coli. In other situations, the risk of disease is recognized to be high and active immunization is carried out, but management factors preclude the value of vaccination. This is particularly true in feedlots where susceptible populations of cattle are not accessible for vaccination prior to the period of highest disease risk. Infections are established before protective antibody is produced by the host and passive immunization represents the only logical immunologie defense.",

However, their potential usefulness in preventing infection must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. When the host naturally responds to infection with a local mucosal immune response or a cellular immune response, parenteral administration of monoclonal antibody may not provide adequate protection against infection. In localized infections of mucosal surfaces, monoclonal antibody may need to be administered to specific sites when circulating antibody does not participate in immunologie control of infection. Whereas this was easily accomplished in enteric colibacillosis by oral administration of K99-specific monoclonal antibody, the logistics of administering monoclonal antibody to the terminal airways in respiratory disease are mechanically complex.",

For the veterinarian in livestock practice who works independently and in relative isolation, the development of test kits for field use will dramatically reduce dependency on a central diagnostic laboratory and increase the availability of test results. In addition, monoclonal antibodies will undoubtedly lead to refinements in current methods of serodiagnosis, particularly in those cases where antigenic cross-reactivity leads to decreased specificity.

Immunotherapy is particularly attractive in veterinary medicine as an alternative to antibiotic therapy. The use of antibiotics in livestock is strictly regulated and the selection of antibiotics by practitioners often depends as much on their persistence in meat, milk, and eggs as it does on the susceptibility of the infecting organism. For example, the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics in cattle requires a 30-day withholding period before treated cattle can be marketed for meat. This inhibits the use of aminoglycosides even when their therapeutic use in indicated. Even more importantly, societal awareness and concern over adulterants in the food supply and the potential for transfer of drug resistance from animal pathogens to human pathogens, demands that the profession of veterinary medicine identify and implement effective alternatives to antibiotic use. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies represents one likely alternative, and new research activity should be directed toward the development of a broad range of immunotherapeutic agents using hybridoma technology.",
