Since the viral polyproteins are largely processed by the main protease (M pro ), and based on the successful development of efficacious antiviral agents targeting 3C-like proteases in other viruses, this ''essential'' protease is considered as a prime target for anti-SARS drug development [7, 8] .

A total of 104 compounds protected permissive Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells) from SARS-CoV infection. Identification of inhibitors of SARS-CoV M pro from this pool of compounds using conventional HPLC-based assays is labor-intensive and time consuming. Here, we report the enzymatic characterization of a recombinant SARS-CoV M pro with authentic SARS-CoV M pro amino acid sequence and the employment of a continuous fluorescence-based assay to identify novel small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV M pro . The efficacies of the 2 selected inhibitors have also been evaluated in cell-based antiviral assays. Our study has defined the kinetic parameters of SARS-CoV M pro in HPLC-based and continuous fluorescence-based assays and validated the usefulness of the fluorescence-based assay in HTS. Our results also provide biologically active novel non-peptide lead compounds for rational drug design of SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors.",

Reverse transcription was performed using Thermoscript RT-PCR system purchased from Invitrogen. The full-length cDNA was subsequently amplified by PCR using forward primer SVMPF (5 0 -CGCGGATCCGATCGAAGGTCGTAGTGGTTTTAGGAAA-ATG-3 0 ) and reverse primer SVMPR (5 0 -CGGAATTCTTATTG-GAA-GGTAACACCAGA-3 0 ). PCR product was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases, ligated to BamHI-EcoRI-digested pET28b DNA (Novagen), and transformed into E. coli DH5a cells by electroporation to generate pET SVMP. The nucleotide sequence of the SARS-CoV M pro gene in plasmid pET SVMP was sequenced to confirm that no undesired mutation has been introduced. The construct was designed in a way that a factor Xa cleavage site was engineered in the N-terminus of the SARS-CoV M pro (His-Tag. . .IEGR # SGFRKM. . .; the factor Xa cleavage site is indicated with a # and the released Nterminal part of the SARS-CoV M pro is bolded).

Since the additional amino acid sequence present in recombinant M pro resulting from cloning procedures might have undesirable properties in in vitro or in vivo assaying systems, we engineered the recombinant SARS-CoV M pro in a way that the final purified recombinant SARS-CoV M pro will have amino acid sequence identical to that of the authentic SARS-CoV M pro . After successive purifications employing affinity chromatography, factor Xa cleavage, anion-exchange chromatog- raphy, and size-exclusion chromatography, we obtained a purified SARS-CoV M pro with a k cat =K m value \u00bc 2.4 \u00c2 10 3 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 using synthetic substrate SP1 and a k cat =K m value \u00bc 2.9 \u00c2 10 4 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 using fluorogenic substrate SP2. The kinetic parameters obtained were comparable to that of other viral 3C-like proteases reported [16, 17] . We noticed that the k cat =K m value (calculated to be 1.8 \u00c2 10 2 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 ) published by Lai's group on a synthetic peptide substrate (H 2 N-TSAVLQSGFRK-COOH) [18, 19] is about 10-fold lower than the one we obtained with our synthetic peptide substrate SP1 (H 2 N-TSAVLQSGFRKW-COOH; k cat =K m value \u00bc 2.4 \u00c2 10 3 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 ). Aside from differences in purification procedures and assaying conditions, and slight difference in amino acid sequence between the two peptides, we do not have an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the results obtained by the two groups. The fluorogenic substrate SP2 used in the study is very sensitive for assaying the cleavage activity of the SARS-CoV M pro . As little as 6.5 nM of the SARS-CoV M pro could be detected in the assaying system we employed (data not shown). This ultra-sensitive substrate, however, could not be used at concentrations higher than 10 lM due to its internal quenching effects [15] ; this property rendered SP2 unsuitable for the determination of K m of the assay system. Nevertheless, SP2 has been demonstrated to be an excellent substrate for HTS purposes and for evaluation of inhibitor potencies.",

The fact that they inhibited the SARS-CoV M pro with K i values around 10 lM protected Vero cells from viral infection at comparable concentrations and exhibited low cytotoxicity towards Vero cells makes them promising leads for anti-SARS drug development. Further investigations using analogues (CB5751 and CB5173) of these two SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors suggested that the position of the nitro group in both inhibitors contributes substantially to their inhibitory activities; changing the 2-nitro group to 3-nitro group (Fig. 4C, D) readily reduced the compounds' ability to inhibit the SARS-CoV M pro (Fig. 6) . We speculate that the 2-nitro group may be involved in forming productive bonding in the inhibitor-enzyme complex. Further structure-activity relationship studies employing more analogues of the identified compounds and site-directed mutagenesis with the SARS-CoV M pro will help us to elucidate the mode of actions of these two novel inhibitors. While this manuscript is in preparation, a number of groups reported the cloning and production of different versions of the SARS-CoV M pro [20, 21] . Others described the development of in vitro assays for screening SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors [22, 23] . We report here the detailed kinetic analysis of a recombinant SARS-CoV M pro with amino acid sequence identical to that of the authentic SARS-CoV M pro and the successful identification of potent small molecule inhibitors of the M pro with demonstrated anti-SARS-CoV activities in cellular models. With the establishment of assaying systems to examine the in vitro cleavage and the cellular anti-SARS-CoV activities, we can now start lead optimization by using focused combinatorial chemical libraries to understand the structure-activities relationship of the two leads and to yield compounds with far superior antiviral activities.
