The survey results show that perceived credibility of false rumors did not affect accuracy-oriented information seeking. However, a significant result was shown in the moderating effect, such that SNS informational dependency interacted with false rumor credibility on accuracy-oriented information seeking. Overall, this study specifically identifies and discusses differences in SNS dependency and accuracy-oriented information seeking in the context of rumor communication to examine the construction of an informed public. Theoretical contributions of this study are discussed.",

Although previous studies revealed that media dependency and credibility are closely linked to each other (Jackob, 2010; Johnson and Kaye, 2004; Perlmutter and Schoen, 2007) , no studies have empirically tested the relationship in the context of rumors, particularly with a focus on Web 2.0 era to our knowledge. However, the extent to which people depend on SNS and their different reasons for using these services must be considered, given that today's rumors are largely disseminated through SNSs including Facebook, Twitter, and other online messaging services (Doerr et al., 2012) . Examining this issue can provide a footstep in the rumor study by answering how people's different dependencies on SNS function in the accuracy-oriented information seeking of false messages.",

Many studies have been conducted on information seeking in the aftermath of adverse events (e.g., Spence et al., 2005) , lending support to the significance of the current paper, which analyzes the public's accuracy-oriented information-seeking behaviors after Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) occurred in South Korea in 2015. We expect that the findings from this research will contribute to better understanding of the interactions between credibility of false rumors and SNS dependency on accuracy-oriented information seeking in the context of rumor communication. Exploring the mechanisms underlying the information seeking, in turn, can help curb the detrimental impact of the false rumors during hazard situations. The current research can be a groundwork for seeking out the relationship between false rumors beliefs, SNS dependency, and information seeking behaviors under risky situations. Furthermore, by differentiating the meaning of information seeking with accuracy-orientated information seeking, this research can open the venue to develop discussions on information seeking.",

In rumor communication, an informed public is hard to be formed if people do not seek accurate facts. During the spread of false rumors that could generate major social problems (Tanaka et al., 2012) , a lack of accuracy-oriented information seeking can produce detrimental effects on a society because people may remain as a passive bystander, not an active searcher, letting false rumors confuse a society.

As previous research noted (Tanaka et al., 2012) , if people easily believe false rumors, they are not likely to find corrective information that are critical in blocking the spread of false rumors. That is, people with high beliefs in false rumors can easily accept the message without having awareness. However, another possibility is that high level of false rumor credibility can facilitate information seeking behaviors by stimulating people's curiosity, which could even lead them to find more accurate information. They may also hold cynical attitudes toward rumors and ignore them, not trying to check facts. Although we can predict different possible results of false rumors credibility, those remain as unsolved issues as no prior studies have empirically examined these possibilities. Hence, now is the time for communication scholars to examine the perceived credibility of false rumors and how the credibility functions in forming an informed public against the spread of false rumors through social media.",

When facing risks, people tend to seek abundant and accurate information to mitigate their uncertainties, as Allport and Lepkin (1945, p.14) stated, \"the more information he has, and the more carefully he thinks, the less chance that he will be led into believing by his inner, and often unrecognized, impulses.\" However, merely spending a lot of time to seek information does not fully explain the meaning of information seeking. Especially regarding rumor communication, efforts to find accurate information against false rumors takes high importance (Crescimbene et al., 2012) , which is termed as accuracy-oriented information seeking in this study, because those effortful behaviors can prevent the circulation of false rumors. This study defines the accuracy-oriented information seeking as people's efforts to find accurate information.",

            "text": "Theoretically, motivated reasoning theory further supports the explanation of accuracy goal-directed information-seeking (Johnson, 1997) . According to the concept of motivated reasoning, an individual is motivated to achieve goals when they process information (Chaiken et al., 1996) . Of the two dimensions of motivation (i.e., accuracy and direction), accuracy goals heighten cross-cutting exposure while lessening selective exposure, thus prompting people to collect diverse pieces of information to reach the most accurate conclusions (Fiske and Taylor, 1991; Hart et al., 2009; Taber and Lodge, 2006) . As noted in politics studies, accuracy motivated individuals try to search for various issues of candidates and evaluate each candidate's characteristics without having any bias (Leeper and Slothuus, 2014) . In contrast, people with directional goals tend to selectively expose themselves to information that corresponds with their opinions. Such directional motivated reasoning affects rumor rebuttals; that is, an individual is likely to ignore the rumor which contradicts his or her beliefs (Kunda, 1990) . Following these discussions, the concept of the accuracy-oriented information seeking, a developed term to be used in this study, corresponds to having accuracy goals when finding additional information in terms of the motivated reasoning theory. Furthermore, although studies have shown that accuracy motivation reduces congeniality bias (selecting one's supporting view rather than opposing view) while increasing uncongeniality bias (selecting one's opposing view rather than supporting view) (Hart et al., 2009) because it facilitates people's tendencies to uncover the truth by holding objectiveness and open-mind (Chaiken et al., 1989; Kunda, 1990) , no research has not directly linked the discussions of motivated reasoning theory with information seeking.",

SNS dependency generally comprise six subsets that are not mutually exclusive: personal understanding, social understanding, personal action orientation, social action orientation, solitary play, and interaction play, which refer to the goals that individuals aim to attain by using media (Ball-Rokeach, 1985; Kim and Jung, 2014; Kim et al., 2015; Loges and Ball-Rokeach, 1993) .

SNS social dependency is regarded as people's tendencies to depend on SNSs to gain social interactive gratification through interpersonal communication (Ha et al., 2015, p. 432) . In this vein, SNS social action orientation dependency and SNS interaction play dependency commonly explain the core reasons for using SNS as social connectivity. SNS social action orientation dependency indicates that people depend on SNS in their daily lives in order to identify better ways to communicate with others, to consider how to improve relationships with acquaintances, and to figure out the ways to communicate with others in important or difficult situations . In the same vein, SNS interaction play dependency explains that people depend on SNS as something to do with their friends or to participate in enjoyable events through SNS Kim and Jung, 2014) . These two subsets collectively explain SNS users' social interactions which makes individuals to \"feel at ease and comfortable to engage in interpersonal communication exchanges through the technology-enabled space\" (Phang et al., 2009, p.729) .",

In this study, we newly term people's dependencies on SNS to acquire knowledge as SNS informational dependency that focuses on cognitive gratification through SNS usage. Indeed, linking between media dependency and information acquisition is a not new topic. Existing research has highlighted the role of media in helping knowledge acquisition (Ha et al., 2015; Humphreys, 2007) . Media users try to understand a society and their communities by relying on news media (whether it is a print, online, or television) (Ball-Rokeach et al., 1984; Loges and Ball-Rokeach, 1993; Patwardhan and Yang, 2003) . For example, they use Facebook or Twitter as an information source of news. Patwardhan and Yang (2003) found a positive relationship between social understanding and online news reading, concluding that people rely on Internet to understand the current society. These lines of research support the need to explore people's dependency on media for information acquisition purposes. These discussions imply that SNS per se do not affect individuals' behaviors. Rather, it is individuals' different motivations for using SNS that affect behaviors (Gil de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2011) .",

That is, while some individuals use SNS for building their social relationships, some use SNS as important information sources, spending time obtaining information through SNS (Wise et al., 2010) . SNS informational dependent users focus on gaining information while SNS social dependent users depend on SNS to better understand their communities. That is, SNS social dependency includes both SNS cognitive and hedonic gratification while SNS informational dependency merely focuses on cognitive gratification (Ha et al., 2015) . Numerous studies have found that using SNS for social purposes has positive effects on information acquisition (cognitive gratification) as well as enjoyment (hedonic gratification) (Ha et al., 2015; Humphreys, 2007; Lin and Lu, 2011) . Particularly, SNS users who are relationship-oriented decrease boredom and feel enjoyment while engaging on social interactions, thus obtaining hedonic benefits from the media (Okazaki, 2008) , as affective social exchange theory noted that engaging in interpersonal communication has a positive effect on affective outcomes by satisfying hedonic gratification (Choo and Petrick, 2014; Ha et al., 2015) . Unlike SNS social dependency, SNS informational dependency is exclusively related to cognitive gratification, such as searching for information, learning, and knowledge acquisition (Nambisan and Baron, 2007) .",

Following this line of logic, we postulate that the effects of perceived credibility of rumors on information-seeking behavior will differ depending on the different levels of SNS dependency under the high risk situation in which MERS occurred. Specifically, we expect that persons who rely on SNS for their information will be more motivated to verify facts than persons who rely on SNS for social purposes. Based on these expectations, the hypotheses and research questions are posed: H1. In a high risk situation, SNS dependency (social and informational) will moderate the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and the accuracy-oriented information seeking.",

The perceived credibility of the MERS rumors was measured in the current study with six questions: 'At that time\u2026' (a) I thought the rumors that I received were believable; (b) I thought the rumors that I received contained accurate information; (c) I thought that the rumors that I received were based on truth; (d) I thought that the rumors that I received contained enough information; (e) I thought that the rumors that I received provided objective information; (f) I believed the rumors that I received (Flanagin and Metzger, 2000; Roberts, 2010; Rosenthal, 1971) . These questions were answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranged from 1 (not at all agree) to 5 (very strongly agree). Internal consistency for the perceived credibility of the rumors was measured using Cronbach's \u03b1, with reliability coefficients of 0.953. After summing all scores of the items, we divided by the number of items to create the mean value. (M = 2.58, SD = 0.89). 3.2.2. SNS dependency (social, informational) Following Kim et al. (2015) , we measured SNS dependency on a 5-point scale that ranged from 1 (not at all useful) to 5 (very useful). SNS social dependency measurement items were: (a) consider how to act with friends, relatives, or people you work with; (b) get ideas about how to approach others in important or difficult situations; (c) have something to do with your friends; (d) have fun with family or friends; (e) be a part of social events you enjoy without having to be there (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.829. M = 3.21, SD = 0.75). In contrast, SNS informational dependency, which focuses on obtaining information by using SNS to better understand the situation, was composed of three items: (a) I usually get information through SNS; (b) I utilize information gained from SNS; (c) I immediately update information received from SNS. All items were measured on a 5-point scale that ranged from 1 (not at all agree) to 5 (strongly agree) and calculated as a mean value (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.664. M = 3.19, SD = 0.75).",

The item was measured using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = do not trust the government at all, 5 = strongly trust the government). Lastly, feelings toward MERS were measured using four elements: uncertainty, fear, anxiety, and feeling terrified and also were measured on a 5-point scale (1 = do not feel at all, 5 = strongly feel), based on the consideration that different levels of feelings affect information seeking (Johnson et al., 2002) . Table 1 shows the demographic profiles of the respondents in the current study. Survey responses from a total of 297 participants (male 49.8%, female 50.2%) who were in their twenties were analysed in the study, and the respondents reported perceiving the South Korean government's credibility as relatively low (M = 1.98, SD = 0.87).

However, SNS social dependency was not found to be a moderator in the accuracy-oriented information seeking. These findings partially supported H2. Fig. 2 presents how SNS informational dependency moderated the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracyoriented information seeking. The lines depicted in the graph show that high levels of SNS informational dependency had a stronger effect on the positive relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking than lower levels.

Based on the assertion that accuracy-oriented information seeking is essential in a desirable society where deliberative democracy is materialized by an informed public (Weeks, 2000) , this study began with the premise that it is important to learn how people seek additional accurate information after they hear false rumors that are later found to be not true. Hence, this paper placed emphasis on accuracy-oriented information seeking based on previous arguments that accuracy goals help people to reach the most desirable conclusions (Chaiken et al., 1996) and have critical viewpoints toward rumors (Crescimbene et al., 2012) .",

Particularly in a risky situation, high levels of perceived rumor credibility may prompt curiosity and interest in the contents of rumors, leading people to seek additional information to satisfy their information needs. As behaviors of spreading rumors stem from the feelings of curiosity and intimacy with others (Fine et al., 2005) , those who have high credibility of rumors also want to feel close intimacy with others and to satisfy curiosities by searching over what others have talked over the rumors. This result represents that people do not always seek for accurate information when they are uncertain.",

After an outbreak of MERS, the then conservative South Korean government was found to control key public information, generating people's concerns, anger, and anxiety (Power, 2015) . Given such confusing situations, rumor credibility itself could have not led people to find accurate information. Rather, many other factors including political orientation (conservative or liberal) may prompt accuracy-oriented information seeking. In general, as liberal people tend to distrust the current South Korean government compared to conservative side, they may try to find more accurate information, regardless of how much rumors credibility they have. Additionally, the collectivistic culture of South Korea can cause them to seek out information in order to more satisfy their hedonic needs instead of cognitive needs. People living in a collectivist culture tend to put more emphasis on intermingling such as relationships with family, friends, colleagues, and etc. (Cho and Cheon, 2005; Kim et al., 1998) . Therefore, they may want to stick with their acquaintances by getting know more about rumors-related stories. In this sense, rumor fact-checking can be done by many other factors, rather than perceived credibility of rumors.",

            "text": "Regarding H1 and RQ2 which questioned the moderating effect of SNS dependency on the relationship between rumor credibility and the accuracy-oriented information seeking, SNS informational dependency showed an interaction effect with rumor credibility on the accuracy-oriented information seeking. Cognitive gratification stems from the U&G theory offers a good starting point for explaining how SNS informational dependency moderates the relationship between perceived credibility of rumors and the accuracyoriented information seeking. It can be inferred from the finding that people who use SNS mainly for obtaining information and have high beliefs in SNS rumors perceive the rumors as imperative information rather than merely social gossips. Once SNS informational dependent users believe rumors, they feel more needs to gratify their desires to learn, which prompt their motivations to find accurate information. Their perceptions of rumor credibility affect their desires to find accurate information because they use SNS for verifying J. Lee, Y. Choi Telematics and Informatics 35 (2018 ) 1071 -1081 the contents of rumors and for acquiring more knowledge and information, focusing on cognitive gratification. For SNS informational dependent users, high levels of credibility of rumors reflects need for cognition, which explains the extent to which people think deeply about received information, thus making an effort to assess the information critically (Metzger and Flanagin, 2015) . Also, the credibility of rumors motivates SNS informational users to think flexibly, termed as flexible thinking (Metzger and Flanagin, 2015) , thus increasing their intentions to search more contradictory information as an effort to evaluate the given rumors critically. Different from using SNS for social purposes that results in increasing affections as affective social exchange theory notes, SNS informational dependency can lead individuals to have critical thoughts under ambiguous situations. Building from these deductions, additional studies would be of interest regarding how information-dependent SNS users have different motivations and how their behaviors relate to information-seeking behaviors. Taken together, this study has significant conceptual implications in a number of aspects. Aiming to expand the understanding of rumor communication, this study focused on the credibility of rumor messages as the independent variable in an effort to determine the effect of credibility on information seeking. Perceived credibility of rumors is imperative for studying the context of rumor communication because it is related to the formation of reasoned communication under risky situations. In this sense, understanding how rumor credibility helps to construct or endanger an informed public is critical. Second, this paper extends the understanding of rumor communication by examining SNS. In contemporary society, the ways in which rumors are disseminated have undergone drastic changes. People are more likely to use SNS than ever before to disseminate false rumors that are spread quickly through SNS (Doerr et al., 2012) , which raises the necessity to examine SNS rumors in today's society.",

The strength of this study is the consideration of individual differences in the functions that SNS provides for users, and the recognition of different aims that information seeking behavior may be attempting to accomplish. The results indicate that the two types function differently in the interactions with rumor credibility, supplementing previous studies regarding SNS dependency, which has not been elaborated in depth on the different dimensions of SNS dependency (e.g. Kim et al., 2015) . Lastly, examining people's behaviors with the aim of constructing rational communication after they receive rumors is another imperative step that this study performed in extending the understanding of rumor communication. By dividing information-seeking behaviors into the quantity and accuracy-oriented, this study distinguished itself from previous rumor studies that did not deeply consider people's actual efforts to eradicate irrational communication behaviors that includes non-accuracy motivated rumor spreading behavior. Because an informed public is a prerequisite for constructing a deliberative democracy (Weeks, 2000) , determining people's actual efforts to build up rational communication against irrationalities is imperative for communication researchers to contribute to societies' well-being.",

It underscores how certain factors affect the formation of an informed public. At the same time, this paper found that SNS can play a role in constructing a public sphere depending on individuals' motivations for using it. Thus, it is difficult to perceive SNSs as merely unofficial channels because of the lack of professional gatekeepers, which was argued in previous studies (Leberecht, 2010; Mendoza et al., 2010) . The role of SNS in rumor communication is differentiated depending on the motivations for using SNS and on psychological factors including the credibility of rumors. In this way, SNS can function in both positive and negative ways in constructing an informed public.",

This study contributes to the growing field of research on information seeking through social media platforms. From the findings of the present paper, in the context of rumor communication, the dearth of information that leads to low perceived credibility is not an exclusive factor in seeking more and accurate information, which is essential in a rational society. Considering that SNS dependency affects information seeking behavior, especially in the era of Web 2.0, the important point is individuals' effortful attempts to be exposed to as much accurate information as possible in order to block false rumors from being circulated and to use SNS in an informational way. From these efforts, SNS can function positively as providing a true public sphere in which laypeople can receive and share accurate information and build up rational communication against the spread of false rumors.",
