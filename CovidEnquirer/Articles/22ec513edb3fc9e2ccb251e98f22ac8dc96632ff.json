Methods: Respiratory samples (nasal/throat swabs) were collected between August 2010 and November 2012 and real time PCR was used to detect different viral pathogens. Results: Viruses were detected in 32.1% (43/134) of samples from 101 patients. Specifically, 9% (12/134) were positive for HBoV, 8.2% (11/134) were positive for HAdV, 5.2% (7/134) were positive for HRV, and 1.5% (2/134) were positive for FLUBV or HMPV, as single infections. HRSV-A, HPIV-3, and HCoV-HKU1 were detected in one (0.75%) sample each. Co-infections were detected in 4.8% (6/134) of the samples. Peaks of viral infections were observed in March, April, May, August, and October. However, positive samples were detected all year round. Only 23.3% (10/43) of the positive samples were collected from patients with febrile illness.",

Most data available focuses on specific populations such as immunosuppressed, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] homeless, 10, 11 or elderly individuals. 5, 12, 13 Viruses are the leading causes of acute respiratory disease throughout the world. Causative agents of respiratory disease in humans include human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), influenza A virus (FLUAV) and influenza B virus (FLUBV), human adenovirus (HAdV), human coronavirus (HCoV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and human bocavirus (HBoV). [1] [2] [3] In addition, two human polyomaviruses (HPyV), KIPyV and WUPyV, have been detected in patients with respiratory infections. 1, 2 In 2000, the Brazilian Ministry of Health established a countrywide surveillance system for respiratory viral infections. This system comprises a network of sentinel units that include outpatient clinics, emergency care departments, and general hospitals that issue a weekly report (using an online system) informing the total number of visits and the number of visits associated with influenza-like illness (ILI) (defined as a case of fever accompanied by cough or sore throat with no other diagnosis). 14, 15 The system is designed to detect only a small number of virus species including FLUAV, FLUBV, HRSV, HAdV, and HPIV-1, -2, and -3. 14 Infections caused by other important viral pathogens such as HPMV, HRV, HBoV, and HCoV are not monitored.",

Real-time PCR amplifications were performed for each virus separately, in an ABI StepOne Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The amplification conditions consisted of 10 min at 95 \u2022 C, followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95 \u2022 C and 60 s at 60 \u2022 C. Amplification was carried out in 24 L reaction volumes, including 5 L of DNA, specific primer for each virus and 12 L of Maxima \u00ae SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Fermentas/Thermo Fischer Scientific, Canada). Each PCR assay for HMPV, HRV-A/B, HAdV, KIPyV or WUPyV used a single pair of primers. Multiplex assays were used to detect and discriminate the distinct species of FLUV, HRSV, HBoV, HIPV and HCoV.",

It has been previously demonstrated that HAdV infections were detected in 8-24.1%, HPIV-3 in 32%, HRSV in 20%, HBoV in 12%, HMPV in 12%, FLUAV in 4%, and FLUBV in 4% of transplant patients. 8, 33 HRV and HMPV were detected in 28.6% and 2%, respectively, in elderly patients. 29 Even so, a study performed in Porto Alegre (Southern Brazil) between November 2008 and October 2010 reported that 22% of infections in immunocompetent adult patients (median age 50.6 years of age) admitted to emergence rooms with ILI or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) were caused by respiratory viruses, mostly FLUAV and HRV-A/B. FLUVB, HAdV, HPIV, HRSV, HMPV, and HCoV were less frequently detected. 34 In the present study, the overall frequency of virus detection was 32.1%. The discrepancy in detection rates could be attributed to differences in the methodologies used, for example, in the former study some samples were tested using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and other samples were tested using conventional PCR assays compared to the use of both conventional and real time PCR assays to detect virus isolates in the present study. The sentinel surveillance system in Brazil focuses on monitoring infections caused by FLUAV and FLUBV and other respiratory viruses such as HAdV, HPIV, HRSV, and HRV-A/B. Samples are sent to and tested in public health laboratories in each state by IFA and all positive, inconclusive, and 10% of negative samples are forwarded to one of three national reference laboratories where they are retested by PCR for respiratory viruses. 14, 15 Between 2000 and 2010 the Brazilian surveillance system recorded 3,291,946 cases of ILI. Of these cases, 37,120 (1% of total ILI visits) had nasopharyngeal samples collected and tested for viral infections. A total of 16,962 (45.7%) tested samples were from patients over 15 years of age with 2604 (15.4%) positive for respiratory viruses. Overall FLUAV and HPIV-3 were the most common viruses detected. However, the detection rate of FLUAV declined from 41% to 18% during this period. 15 In our study, HAdV, HBoV, and HRV were the most common viruses detected. FLUBV was detected in only 1.5% (2/134) of tested samples and FLUAV was not detected.",

The PCR products were analyzed by 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Positive and negative controls were included in each run.

Positive controls of FLUAV and FLUBV consisted of allantoic fluid from FLUV infected embryonic eggs.
