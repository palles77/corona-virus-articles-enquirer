Though conserved across vertebrates, the IL-26 gene is functionally inactivated in a few mammals like rat, mouse and horse. We report here the identification, isolation and cloning of the cDNA of IL-26 from the dromedary camel. The camel cDNA contains a 516 bp open reading frame encoding a 171 amino acid precursor protein, including a 21 amino acid signal peptide. Sequence analysis revealed high similarity with other mammalian IL-26 homologs and the conservation of IL-10 cytokine family domain structure including key amino acid residues. We also report the identification and cloning of four novel transcript variants produced by alternative splicing at the Exon 3-Exon 4 regions of the gene. Three of the alternative splice variants had premature termination codons and are predicted to code for truncated proteins. The transcript variant 4 (Tv4) having an insertion of an extra 120 bp nucleotides in the ORF was predicted to encode a full length protein product with 40 extra amino acid residues. The mRNA transcripts of all the variants were identified in lymph node, where as fewer variants were observed in other tissues like blood, liver and kidney. The expression of Tv2 and Tv3 were found to be up regulated in mitogen induced camel peripheral blood mononuclear cells. IL-26-Tv2 expression was also induced in camel fibroblast cells infected with Camel pox virus in-vitro. The identification of the transcript variants of IL-26 from the dromedary camel is the first report of alternative splicing for IL-26 in a species in which the gene has not been inactivated.",

Although the members of this family share low amino acid identity, they share a similar helical structure and functionally target homologous but diverse class II cytokine receptors (Sabat, 2010) . Like other members of the IL-10 family, IL-26 also utilizes a hetero-dimeric receptor, IL-26R comprising of IL-20R1 and IL-10R2 receptors. Binding of IL-26 to IL-26R induces signal transduction by phosphorylation and activation of STAT3 and STAT1 (H\u00f6r et al., 2004; Sheikh et al., 2004) . Initially denoted as AK155, IL-26 was identified in Herpesvirus saimiri transformed human T cells and later included as a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines (Knappe et al., 2000) . IL-26 is also expressed by activated Th1, Th17, stimulated natural killer (NK) and peripheral mononuclear blood cells (Braum et al., 2013) . Of late, IL-26 is gaining significance because of its purported role in many pro-inflammatory diseases and its upstream position in the pro-inflammatory cascade and as the potential drug target for chronic inflammatory disorders (Corvaisier et al., 2012) . It has been recently reported that IL-26 is over-expressed in chronically HCV infected patients, enhancing the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) mediated cytotoxicity and induction of expression of the antiviral cytokines IFN-\u2424 and IFN-\u2425 (Miot et al., 2014) .",

It is also presumed that these three genes are co-regulated, as IL-26 is reported to be co-transcribed along with IL-22 and IFN-\u2425 (Braum et al., 2013) . The human IL-26 gene consists of five exons, which are interrupted by four introns -three small and one large intron (Knappe et al., 2000) . The IL-26 gene is conserved across vertebrates, but interestingly found absent in mouse genome where only short exon fragments of the gene were identified (Braum et al., 2012) .

It is estimated that around 95% of the human multi exon genes undergo alternative splicing (Pan et al., 2008) . As an evolutionary tool, alternative splicing serves as an economical mechanism to produce diversity and specificity at the cellular, tissue or developmental levels and along with non-sense mediated decay, it provides a trial and error mechanism for the evolution of gene structure (Boue et al., 2003) . IL-26 has also been reported to undergo alternative splicing in horse, where the gene has been predicted to be inactivated. In this paper we describe the molecular structure of the dromedary camel IL-26 gene and the identification of the novel transcript variants generated by alternative splicing. This is the first report of alternative splicing of IL-26 gene, from a species in which the gene has not been inactivated. The tissue specific distribution of the variants as well as the effect of viral infection on transcription was also studied in cell culture system.",

This additional 120 bp nucleotide sequence corresponds to the 22 bp sequence of variant Cd-IL-26-Tv2 followed by the 98 bp of Cd-IL-26-Tv3 (Fig. 5) . Alignment with the genomic sequence revealed that Tv4 transcript variant is the result of two different splicing mechanisms, namely the alternative splicing to extend the length of the Exon 3 from 135 to 157 (exon 3A) as in Tv2 and the introduction of an additional 98 bp -the exon 3B as in Tv3 (Fig. 4) . Unlike the Tv2 and Tv3 splice variants, the addition of the 120 bp in the Tv4 transcript is in the same frame of translation and without any interrupting termination codons. The 636 bp ORF of this splice variant thus codes for a longer IL-26 isoform with 211 amino acids. The predicted protein encoded by this variant has 40 additional amino acids when compared to the normal IL-26-Tv1 (Fig. 6A) .",

The members of the IL-10 family of cytokines are characterized by a predominantly alpha helical structure composed of five to seven alpha helices. The helices are arranged to form a compact bundle with hydrophobic amino acids constituting an internal hydrophobic core, which is stabilized by one to three disulphide bridges (Zdanov, 2010) . The predicted mature protein of the camel IL-26 also seems to be predominantly alpha helical with the helices constituting around 70.6% of the total structure. Six alpha helical bundles have been predicted for the mature protein encoded by Tv1 (Fig. 1) . The crystal structure of IL-26 has not been reported so far and structural models have been predicted based on already identified structures of other IL-10 family cytokines -human IL-10 and IL-19. The structure of IL-26 based on the IL-19 scaffold has been proposed to be a better model than IL-10 as evidenced by the proper alignment of the cysteine residues. Further data suggest both IL-19 and IL-26 can bind to the same receptor IL20R1 (Donnelly et al., 2010) . The mature dromedary camel IL-26 features five conserved cysteine residues (at amino acid positions 32, 79, 102, 121 and 124) reported to be conserved in other mammalian IL-26 homologs also (Fig. 1) . The IL-26 structure based on the IL-19 scaffold suggests that Cysteine pairs Cys-32/Cys-124 and Cys-79/Cys-121 form disulphide bonds, whereas Cys-102 at the N-terminal end of helix D may be involved in intermolecular disulphide bonds facilitating dimerization (Donnelly et al., 2010) .",

IL-26 is unique among the members of the IL-10 family due to its highly cationic nature. Human IL-26 has a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 10.7 which is mainly attributed to the presence of 30 Lys and Arg residues in the mature protein (Braum et al., 2012) . The camel IL-26 also has a predicted pI of 10.45 and has 27 Lys and Arg residues in the 150 amino acid mature protein. The Tv2 with the 114 aa mature protein has an estimated pI value of 10.3 with 19 Lys and Arg residues. Similarly Tv3 with the 142 aa mature protein has 23 Lys and Arg residues and a predicted pI of 10.69. IL-26 is reported to have a high heparin binding affinity due to the strong positive charge and the helix A-B region has been suggested as the Fig. 6B . Structural comparison of the human IL-26 and the predicted camel IL-26 proteins: Using the PHYRE automatic protein structure modeling server we created 3D homology models for the human IL-26 (i) and the predicted mature proteins of all the five alternative splice variants of camel IL-26-Tv1 to Tv5 (ii to vi) heparin binding domain for the cytokine (H\u00f6r et al., 2004) .

Based on the alignment of the cDNA sequences with the C. ferus genomic sequence, it could be inferred that the IL-26 isoforms are generated by alternative splicing through different mechanisms. Alternative splicing is a versatile mechanism to increase protein diversity in which diverse transcripts potentially encoding diverse proteins are produced from the same locus of the genome. Recent studies have revealed that many of these alternative splice variants, previously presumed to encode truncated protein variants are actually targeted by a eukaryotic mRNA surveillance mechanism called Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) (Lareau et al., 2007) . Alternative splicing combined Fig. 7 . Expression of IL-26 alternative splice variants in different tissues of dromedary camel tissues and in-vitro mitogen stimulated PBMCs (A) Total mRNA was isolated from camel tissues were reverse transcribed and the cDNA was used as template for amplification with IL26XF1&IL26XR1 primers (B) Camel PBMCs were stimulated in vitro with PWM or Con A (10 g/ml) for 16 hrs. Unstimulated PBMCs under identical culture conditions were also kept as control for 16 h. RNA isolated from stimulated samples and control (3 different camels) was used for cDNA synthesis. IL26 expression profile was analyzed with IL26XF1 and IL26XR1 primers on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using a DNA 1000 kit. Size standards for IL-26 transcript variants were made by PCR amplification of the previously cloned camel IL-26 Tv1 to Tv5 variants using IL26XF1 and IL26XR1. Equal mixture of these amplicons was used to create the size standards loaded in lane marked IL26Tv Mix.",

It has been proposed that a termination codon located more than 50 bp upstream of the last exon junction is recognized as premature termination codon (PTC) and the transcript is subjected to NMD (Nagy and Maquat, 1998) . We analyzed in-silico whether the four alternative IL-26 transcript variants could be subjected to NMD based on this rule. For Cd-IL26 Tv2, Cd-IL26 Tv3 and Cd-IL26 Tv5 variants the new stop codons are located only 46, 38 and 20 bp upstream from the last exon junction (Fig. 5) and hence may not be subjected to NMD. The Cd-IL26-Tv4 like the normal Cd-IL-26-Tv1 does not have any interrupting stop codon and hence not subjected to NMD. It appears that all the four transcript variants could be translated normally without NMD and encode IL-26 protein isoforms. However, some of these variant protein isoforms may differ in their activity when compared with the canonical IL-26 protein as the truncated variants lack required regions for receptor binding.",

The amino acid sequences of these four helices are identical in all the five transcript variants (Fig. 6A) . The second IL-10 signature motif located in the helix F (amino acid residue sequence KAISELDILLSWIK) is completely conserved in human, camel and other mammalian IL-26 ( Fig. 1) proteins and contains the amino acids predicted to be involved in binding to the IL20R1 receptor chain (Donnelly et al., 2010) . The truncated proteins predicted to be encoded by the variants Tv2, Tv3 and Tv5 lack this motif (Figs. 6A and B) and may exert different biological action compared to the wild type. Among the IL-10 family of cytokines, alternative splicing has been reported in IL-10 (Wu et al., 2005) and IL-24 (Sahoo et al., 2008) . In IL-10, the alternative splice variant IL-10 \u24263 lacking exon 3 was observed in children with relapsed childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). It was proposed that IL-10 \u24263 isoform may be involved in modulating IL-10 mediated biological effects and the expression of IL-10 \u24263 isoform was correlated with a better response to chemotherapy in relapsed childhood ALL (Wu et al., 2005) . Splice variants lacking exons 3 and 5 of human IL-24 were identified from normal melanoblasts, and the loss of the expression of this splice IL-26 transcript variants were amplified by RT-PCR using IL26XF1 /IL26XR1 primers and analyzed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using a DNA 1000 kit. Size standards for IL-26 transcript variants were made by PCR amplification of the cloned camel IL-26 Tv1 to Tv5 variants using IL26XF1 and IL26XR1. Equal mixture of these amplicons was used to create the size standards and analyzed along with the samples. First panel in each set represents the virtual image for the fragments separated on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The second and third panel represent the electropherograms of IL-26 transcript variants of control/infected (blue) overlaid with the IL-26Tv standard mix (red) for size comparison. The induction of IL-26 transcript variant 2 in virus infected samples is marked by an arrow. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) variant was associated with metastatic melanoma (Allen et al., 2004) . In mouse, a novel splice variant of IL-24/FISP, lacking 29 nucleotides from 5 end of exon 4 was identified and designated as FISP-sp. This variant, unlike the normal IL-24/FISP was not secreted but was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, dimerised with FISP and inhibited FISP induced apoptosis (Sahoo et al., 2008) . Alternative splice variants in many cytokines have been reported to act as functional antagonists of the corresponding wild-type cytokines and suggest that the alternative splicing in response to various stimuli can significantly alter the cellular activity (Sahoo and Im, 2010) . The identification of the transcript variants from dromedary camel IL-26 is the first report of alternative splicing for IL-26 in species in which the gene has not been inactivated. Based on whole transcriptome data and RT-PCR, alternative transcripts have been identified in horse IL-26, but the gene in horse has been inactivated by one base pair deletion in exon2 and this gene inactivating mutation is conserved in related species like the Przewalski's horse and donkey (Shakhsi-Niaei et al., 2013) . The protein expression, localization and functional activity of the camel IL-26 isoforms need to be evaluated in future studies.",

Splice variants Tv2 and Tv3 seemed to be up regulated in-vitro stimulated camel PBMC (Fig. 7B) .
