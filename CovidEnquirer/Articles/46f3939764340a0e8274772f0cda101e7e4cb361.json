Implementing laboratory-based influenza surveillance requires substantial investments in infrastructure and training. However, continuing outbreaks of avian influenza A \u2044 H5N1 in poultry and emergence of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic strain further Introduction Influenza virus infection causes predictable and sometimes severe seasonal epidemics of respiratory illness in temperate climates characterized by substantial morbidity in all age groups and significant mortality in the elderly. 1,2 Antigenic and genetic analysis of influenza A (H3N2) viruses indicate that influenza viruses continually circulate in Southeast Asia via a network of temporally overlapping epidemics that seed viruses in temperate regions. This finding underscores the importance of establishing laboratory-based surveillance in Southeast Asia to improve global antigenic forecasting and vaccine strain selection. 3, 4 While data are limited, recent studies also suggest a significant burden of disease from influenza in Southeast Asia. [5] [6] [7] Influenza surveillance systems with laboratory confirmation provide data to improve understanding of influenza disease burden and seasonality in tropical developing countries, support the development of prevention and treatment strategies, and improve global pandemic preparedness. [8] [9] [10] Access to rapid and accurate influenza laboratory diagnostics is essential to identify new influenza virus strains with pandemic potential and rapidly conduct outbreak investigation and containment efforts. 11 On at least three occasions in the past century shifts in the influenza virus genome have generated pandemic strains resulting in hundreds of millions of illnesses and tens of millions of deaths. 12, 13 Beginning in East and Southeast Asia in 2003, repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A \u2044 H5N1 in poultry have been documented with 263 fatal human infections recorded worldwide as of December 11, 2009. 14,15 Unexpectedly in early 2009, a novel reassortant influenza A(H1N1) virus of swine origin emerged in the Americas and rapidly spread to more than 90 countries causing the WHO to declare a pandemic on June 11th . .

Under the leadership of the Lao PDR Ministry of Health (MOH), advances in the infectious disease surveillance system and improved laboratory diagnostic capacity for respiratory pathogens have been achieved. In December 2006, Lao PDR obtained the in-country diagnostic capacity to analyze specimens for influenza viruses as part of a national AI outbreak response program and established an ILI surveillance system in the capital city of Vientiane. The objectives of the ILI surveillance program were to improve understanding of influenza disease burden and seasonality, to monitor circulating virus strains for new variants with pandemic potential, and to enable the early detection and response to influenza outbreaks. In July 2008, surveillance was expanded to include hospitalized pneumonia patients to better understand the epidemiology of severe influenza infections and identify groups at highest risk for serious complications. We describe findings from the first 2 years of influenza surveillance and discuss challenges and priorities for future influenza surveillance and disease burden research in a severely resource limited environment.",

Influenza-like illness was defined using the WHO case definition of fever \u202138\u00b0C, plus cough and \u2044 or throat pain. The surveillance hospitals are centrally located and the catchment population is mainly urban residents of Vientiane. During 2007, the system aimed to collect specimens from four ILI patients per hospital per week, however collection rates varied as new administrative and operational procedures were implemented. In 2008, the sampling approach was adjusted to collect respiratory swab specimens from all patients that met the ILI case definition during one clinic day each week at each hospital. 21 Surveillance was conducted 1 day per week during the hours of 8 am to 3:30 pm. A surveillance nurse screened incoming patients for any report of fever, cough or sore throat. If these were present, an oral temperature was measured using a mercury thermometer. If the patient met the WHO ILI case definition, a nasal and throat specimen was collected using two flocked swabs, placed together in universal viral media (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA), and stored at 4\u00b0C until transported to the laboratory the same day. On receipt at the National Center for Laboratory and Epidemiology laboratory, samples were assigned anonymous identification numbers, transferred to a biosafety cabinet, and aliquoted for long-term storage at )80\u00b0C. Beginning in 2008, the number, age and gender of all patients seeking outpatient care were recorded each week in the participating wards of the three sentinel hospitals. In addition, the number, age and gender of patients presenting with ILI symptoms were summarized. These data permitted monitoring overall trends in ILI activity for 2008 ( Figure 1 ), but unfortunately were not available for 2007.",

In children aged <14 years, the ALRI case definition was fever \u202138\u00b0C on admission and cough with dyspnea, tachypnea or shortness of breath. For patients \u202114 years, the case definition was the same except tachypnea was not included and chest pain, dyspnea, and \u2044 or adventitious breath sounds were required. Diagnostic screening for tuberculosis and HIV was conducted for suspect cases according to hospital policy. Patients with active tuberculosis, HIV positive or otherwise compromised immunity, and patients who reported an onset of symptoms 14 or more days prior to admission were excluded. Respiratory clinical swabs were collected and handled in the same manner as the ILI outpatient surveillance system.

Subsequently, the RNA underwent a single freeze-thaw cycle during analysis. The RVP primer mix contains 16 primer pairs designed to simultaneously amplify highly conserved regions of viral types and subtypes, specifically influenza A \u2044 H1, A \u2044 H3 and A \u2044 H5, influenza B, RSV A, RSV B, coronavirus (229E, OC43, SARS, NL63, HKU1), parainfluenza virus 1-4, metapneumovirus, adenovirus and enterovirus \u2044 rhinoviruses. The RVP assay uses a single primer pair targeting a conserved region of 5\u00a2-UTR to detect viruses of the closely related enterovirus and rhinovirus genera.",

Groups at highest risk for serious complications such as pregnant women, young children, persons with underlying disease and health care providers 25 have been designated as priority groups for influenza vaccination. This new policy will be adjusted as additional data from expanded influenza surveillance activities in Laos become available. Finally, newly established laboratory and outbreak response capabilities have also begun to demonstrate the frequency and severity of influenza outbreaks in remote areas of Laos. During 2008 and 2009, seasonal influenza A(H1) and A(H3) strains were identified in three separate febrile respiratory illness outbreak investigations in ethnic minority communities in remote northern regions.",

All patients were discharged alive.Five representative influenza-positive clinical specimens from 2007 were sent to the WHO Influenza Collaborating Center in Tokyo for viral culture, molecular and antigenic analysis. Two H1N1, two H3N2 viruses and one type B virus were isolated. These viruses were subjected to Hemagluttanin Inhibition (HI) testing using WHO reference antisera. Two H1N1 viruses were found to be antigenically similar to A \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 59 \u2044 2007, two H3N2 viruses were concluded to be A \u2044 Brisbane \u2044 10-like, and a type B isolate was from the B \u2044 Victoria-lineage and antigenically similar to B\u2044 Hiroshima \u2044 1 \u2044 2005.
