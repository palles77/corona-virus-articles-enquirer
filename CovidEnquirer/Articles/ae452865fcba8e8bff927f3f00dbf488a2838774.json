Methods: Clinical follow up and qPCR based respiratory, gastrointestinal and vaginal pathogen carriage before and after travel were prospectively assessed in a cohort of medical students departing from Marseille, France. Results: 134 students were included. 73.9%, 38.8% and 5.0% of students reported gastrointestinal, respiratory and vaginal symptoms, respectively. The acquisition rate of Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) was 53% and 41%, respectively. The acquisition of respiratory viruses was low but associated with persisting symptoms, while bacterial acquisition ranged from 3.3% for Streptococcus pyogenes to 15.0% for Haemophilus influenzae. Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae acquisition rates were 7.7% and 14.3% respectively. Five students (5.1%) had molecular quantification criteria for bacterial vaginosis on return. Conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrates that besides the known risk of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections and associated changes in intestinal and respiratory microbiota, medical students abroad may also experience changes in vaginal microbiota leading, in some cases, to clinical symptoms or the acquisition of bacterial vaginosis, which may be asymptomatic.",

            "text": "In 2018, French people undertook an estimated 24.5 million trips to French Overseas territories, mainly in Europe and, to a lesser extent, Africa, America and Asia [1] . International travellers are exposed to the acquisition of pathogens associated with travel, with a potential risk to the community or the hospital population upon return, whether or not they are symptomatic while travelling. This has been extensively described, by example, among French Hajj pilgrim travelling to Mecca, Saudi Arabia [2, 3] . A significant proportion of medical students from high-income countries participate in usually self-organised, but also arrange through faculty partnership or commercial volunteer placement organizations, clinical electives abroad -also known as international medical electives or global health electives [4] . Electives typically last between one and three months. As an example, Work the World, an Australian organization, placed 15,000 medical students since 2005 [5] . Destination may be in developed countries, but low and middle-income countries are becoming popular destinations. International medical electives are generally clinical immersion experiences, but younger medical students may also participate to humanitarian missions unrelated to clinical activities [4] . In addition to the clinical placements themselves, many students add cultural side trips and wilderness or other adventures to their itineraries [4] . Health risks for medical students while on electives abroad are a subject which concerns the medical profession. There is, however, little recent data about infectious diseases among medical students doing part of their studies abroad [6] [7] [8] . In one Australian survey, 64% of students experienced some sort of health problems, of which travellers' diarrhoea was the most common (40%) and 12.5% contracted upper respiratory tract infection (including influenza) [6] . In a Dutch study, 65% students reported diarrhoea, 33% constipation, 29% skin infections and wounds, and 11% respiratory tract infections [7] . In a Swedish study, 69% of students reported diarrhoea [8] .",

Recruitment was done on a voluntary basis, during their vaccination and pre-travel consultation at the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire M\u00e9diterran\u00e9ee Infection, which is on the Marseille University medical campus. Participants were asked to sign a written informed consent form and to complete an inclusion questionnaire covering demographic data, intended travel dates and destination, and history of chronic illness. Vaccination status following consultation was recorded. All participants received advice regarding the prevention of traveller's diarrhoea (hand hygiene and safe food and water habits) and the usefulness of personal preventive measures against insect bites (mosquito bed net and repellent) and warnings regarding rabies risks. Travellers to malaria-endemic zones were prescribed malaria chemoprophylaxis. Participants were invited to self-collect throat, nasal, faecal and vaginal samples during the week preceding departure and during the week following their return to France. Samples were collected using commercial rigid cotton-tipped swab applicators (Medical Wire & Equipment, Wiltshire, United Kingdom) and placed in viral transport media (Sigma Virocult\u00ae, Wiltshire, United Kingdom). For nasal sampling, participants were trained to insert the swab into one nostril (about 2 cm). For pharyngeal sampling, participants introduced the swab into the oral cavity and gently rubbing the tonsillar pillars several times. For rectal sampling, participants introduced the swab into the rectum through the anus (about 3 cm). For vaginal sampling, participants placed the swab in the vagina (about 3 cm) avoiding touching the skin and vulva with the swab and gently rubbed the inner walls several times. Samples were returned to our institute by participants for processing. Students were also provided with a return questionnaire addressing the exact place where the internship took place, the type of activities conducted, tourism and travel to other countries during the internship period, housing conditions, contact with children and animals, and symptoms and treatment during the stay. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as the association of cough, sore throat and subjective fever [9] . Diarrhoea was defined by at least three loose or liquid stools per day. [11] were amplified with internal DNA extraction controls TISS, as previously described.",

According to data of the Aix Marseille Faculty of Medicine, 247 (60.1%) and 242 (62.1%) of the students were females in the second and fourth year respectively, in 2018. In our study, female students accounted for 101 (74.6%) of participants, which is consistent with previous studies showing that more females participate in study abroad programmes than males [7, 8] while the proportion of female among students who did not participate to elective abroad was 58.2%. Given the young age of the participants, the prevalence of chronic diseases was low. The duration of the stays abroad was in the same range as that in other recent studies conducted on medical students [7, 8] . The most frequent destinations were developing countries including Vietnam, India and Peru and most students took part in longterm humanitarian missions, including in relatively remote areas with poor sanitary conditions, being immersed in local population and in frequent contact with children and animals.",

            "text": "More than seven students out of ten reported gastrointestinal symptoms (notably diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea-vomiting which is suggestive of gastroenteritis). This result is in line with other studies conducted on medical students abroad, confirming that despite reinforced pre-travel advice, travellers' diarrhoea was highly frequent among medical students who were fully aware of the means of preventing it [6] [7] [8] . In a large five-year study conducted among European travellers, pre-travel advice was not associated with lower rates of traveller's diarrhoea, suggesting that current preventive strategies should be revised [23] . We observed a low rate of EAEC (4.0%) but a relatively high rate of EPEC (19.2%) carriage in asymptomatic students before travel, in marked contrast with recent findings describing rates of 1-2% in pre-travel stools of Finish travellers using a validated qPCR multiplex assay [24] . High rates of both EAEC (17.5%) and EPEC (14.0%) were also observed in asymptomatic Hajj pilgrims departing from Marseille to Saudi Arabia [25] . Such high rates of EPEC in both asymptomatic medical students and an older Muslim population from Marseille at baseline warrants further investigation in different populations, to better understand the local epidemiology of EPEC in southern France. Nevertheless, we documented a dramatically high acquisition rate of EAEC (53.0%) and EPEC (41.0%) among medical students, as documented in other recent studies conducted in different populations of international travellers [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . This acquisition of E. coli is worrying and deserves further investigation aimed at evaluating antibiotic resistance in these bacteria, since one study conducted in medical students revealed a 35% acquisition rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriae [8] . We found no significant association between diarrhoea and E. coli carriage in our study, in contrast with other studies where EAEC has been reported to be frequently associated with diarrhoea in travellers returning from various geographical areas [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . This may be explained either by asymptomatic colonisation or by prolonged nucleic acid shedding in the absence of viable pathogens. Also, the onset of gastro-intestinal symptoms occurred early during the trip, while sampling was performed on return, several weeks later. Sampling at the time of the onset of symptoms should be performed in future studies. Respiratory symptoms (mostly rhinitis and pharyngitis) affected 38.8% of medical students, compared with 11-12.5% in other studies conducted on medical students [6, 7] and 28% in a cohort of Australian travellers returning from Asia (mostly tourists) [32] . The higher rate of respiratory symptoms in our study may have resulted from the frequent contact which students had with children. We found a significant association between viral carriage on return and persisting respiratory symptoms, while no association was found with bacterial carriage, suggesting that most respiratory infections were indeed due to viruses. The most common virus acquired was human rhinovirus (6.7%) while the influenza virus was not detected. Studies conducted among ill international travellers to tropical and sub-tropical areas suffering respiratory tract infection symptoms in association with fever showed that influenza viruses were isolated in 14.2-24.7% of cases [33, 34] . The small number of patients with febrile respiratory tract infections in our cohort is a likely explanation for the lack of detection of the influenza virus.",

Further studies including larger numbers of students are needed to investigate the potential risk factors for clinical infections and modifications of microbiota. Despite students were asked for other symptoms overall, we cannot exclude that some symptoms were not reported, notably sexually transmitted infection or blood-borne infection symptoms. Also, we did not ask students for sexual contacts whilst overseas. It should be noted that non-infectious disease risk were not addressed in this study. Finally, the sample size was too small to address the potential effect of destination on symptoms and changes in microbiota.",
