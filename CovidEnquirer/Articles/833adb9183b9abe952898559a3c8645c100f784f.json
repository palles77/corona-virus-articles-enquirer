SQS1 gene from G. uralensis (GuSQS1) was cloned and over-expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Six recombinant P. pastoris strains containing different copy number of GuSQS1 were constructed. HPLC was used to assay the level of ergosterol in all transgenic P. pastoris strains containing GuSQS1. HPLC analysis showed that the contents of ergosterol in all of the transgenic P. pastoris containing GuSQS1 were higher than that in the negative control. And with the increase of copy number of GuSQS1, the content of ergosterol showed an increasing-decreasing-increasing pattern. The contents of ergosterol in 10-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris and 47-copy-GuSQS1 P. pastoris were significantly higher than that in the rest recombinant P. pastoris strains. In conclusion, the CNVs of GuSQS1 influence the content of secondary metabolites in the MVA pathway. The present study provides a basis for over-expressing GuSQS1 and increasing the content of glycyrrhizin in G. uralensis cultivars.",

            "text": "Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch (commonly named licorice) is a well-known medicinal plant in China. The root of G. uralensis is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for their functions of relieving coughing, nourishing qi, tonifying spleen and stomach, alleviating pain, and eliminating phlegm decline, which is caused by irresponsible excessive exploitation. The Chinese government has recently imposed a serial of restrictions on the collection and commercial uses of wild G. uralensis (National Development and Reform Commission [2000] No. 13) . As a result, G. uralensis cultivars have become the main resource of this Chinese herb. However, the level of glycyrrhizin in G. uralensis cultivars is remarkable low and can not meet the requirements of Chinese pharmacopoeia [8] . So improving the quality of cultivars becomes a key issue. Some researchers have tried to solve this problem by accumulating glycyrrhizin in cell suspension cultures of G. uralensis [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, the results are not promising; glycyrrhizin is not present in cell suspension cultures of G. uralensis. Recent report about genetic engineering in G. uralensis is infrequent, but using genetic engineering method to increase the content of secondary metabolites in other plants is very common [13] [14] . Therefore, developing genetic engineering method to increase the content of glycyrrhizin in G. uralensis would be important and interesting. And one of the effective ways is to modify the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin.",

SQS gene belongs to a multigene family; two kinds of SQS with different expressing activity have been found in Arabidopsis thaliana [20] [21] , Glycyrrhiza glabra, [22] and several other plants [23] [24] . In the present study, SQS1 was selected as a target gene. We hypothesized that overexpressing SQS1 gene from G. uralensis (GuSQS1) may affect the accumulation of glycyrrhizin. There are few reports on the transformation and overexpression of GuSQS1 gene. Lu et al [17] and Zhang et al [25] have investigated the overexpression of Gu SQS1 gene in hairy root cultures of G. uralensis. However, the effects of copy number of GuSQS1 gene in transgenic hairy roots on the production of metabolites were not studied in their work.",

Using real-time PCR, the copy numbers of GuSQS1 in different transgenic P. pastoris were 1, 2, 4, 10, 16, and 47 copies, respectively. The RT-PCR results showed that GuSQS1 was expressed in transgenic P. pastoris at different levels. And the relative expression of GuSQS1 in recombinant P. pastoris containing 4-copy-GuSQS1 was higher than that in other recombinant P. pastoris. Because SQS1 gene is also an important gene in the self-metabolism of P. pastoris, so the analysis of metabolites of P. pastoris can help better understand the influence of CNVs of GuSQS1 in the biosynthetic pathway. The HPLC results showed that, in all the recombinant P. pastoris, the contents of ergosterol were greater than that in the negative control. And with the increasing of copy number of GuSQS1 the content of ergosterol presented in an increasing-decreasing-increasing pattern. In the recombinant P. pastoris containing 10 copies and 47 copies of GuSQS1 gene the contents of ergosterol were much higher than that in others.",

            "text": "Biologically, the difference in gene copy number can lead to variations of enzyme content and finally affect the formation of relevant products. Accordingly, with the increase of GuSQS1 copy number, the content of corresponding enzyme was also increasing, resulting in the accumulation of ergosterol. As a result, the content of ergosterol in recombinant P. pastoris containing 10 copies of GuSQS1 was higher than that in recombinant P. pastoris containing 1 copy, 2 copies and 4 copies of GuSQS1. However, when the copy number increased to 16, the content of ergosterol did not increase, but decrease. Regarding this phenomenon, we can only conjecture how this was happening. Since the expression of GuSQS1 in recombinant P. pastoris containing 16-copy-GuSQS1 gene was not the lowest, the chance of gene silencing caused by integration sites of exogenous gene was very small. Recently many researchers have reported the feedback inhibition in plants over-expressing exogenous genes [39] [40] . So it is possible that increasing of squalene synthase and 2, 3-oxidosquale result in feedback inhibition of the upstream steps in MVA pathway and finally influence the accumulation of ergosterol. However, when copy number increased to 47, the content of ergosterol (25.21 \u03bcg) increased again and was near to the highest level (26.05 \u03bcg) under the experimental conditions. Because there are still uncertainties about the complicated procedure of MVA pathway, this phenomenon remained to be elusive. We speculate that the possible reason is the interruption of the feedback inhibition. In organisms when the decrease in enzyme level caused by feedback inhibition to some extent, the feedback inhibition will be inhibited and the metabolic pathway will be activated. This may be the reason of the high content of ergosterol in P. pastoris containing 47 copies of GuSQS1 gene. At the same time, there is another explanation for this, in recombinant P. pastoris such an abundant expression of an exogenous gene may cause a great burden in the self-metabolism of host strain, which may cause the disorder of biosynthetic pathway of ergosterol in P. pastoris containing too many GuSQS1 genes. Nevertheless, the mechanisms responsible for the relations between copy number and gene products need further investigations.",

As a key enzyme in MVA pathway, it can also increase the accumulation of glycyrrhizin in G. uralensis. However, the formation of glycyrrhizin in G. uralensis is a very complicated metabolic network and regulated by many enzymes, and GuSQS1 is only one of them. This study provided an important basis for further work on exploring the biosynthesis of glycyrrhizin in vitro. In addition to G. uralensis some other Chinese herbs, such as Glycyrrhiza glabra [9] also harbor glycyrrhizin. Therefore, this study could form basis for further studies on glycyrrhizin biosynthesis in those medicinal plants.",
