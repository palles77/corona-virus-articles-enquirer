Approval for the study was granted by the University of Liverpool Research Ethics Committee. A group of non-pug dogs, also diagnosed with PLE within the same period, was selected for comparison. PLE was defined as any gastrointestinal disease resulting in serum albumin below the laboratory reference interval that could not be explained by another cause. Factors associated with survival were assessed using simple statistics (Mann-Whitney tests and chi-square test as appropriate) and Cox's proportional hazards regression. Initially, factors were tested individually using simple regression; a multiple regression model was then created, subsequently refined by backwards stepwise elimination until the best model was found. A total of 35 pugs were diagnosed with a PLE between 2009 and 2018 and were compared with 113 dogs from other breeds. On simple regression analysis, factors associated with survival (at P < 0.1) were pug breed (P = 0.002), diet used for treatment (P = 0.022), receiving immunosuppressive therapy (P = 0.089), and treatment with cobalamin (P = 0.005). However, the only factors that remained in the final model were the pug breed and the diet used for treatment. In this respect, dogs of the pug breed were associated with a greater hazard of dying (compared with non-pugs: hazards ratio [HR] 2.67 (CI 1.60-4.47; P < 0.001), whilst being fed a hydrolysed diet was associated with a lesser hazard risk of death than when fed other diets (compared with low-fat diets: HR 0.50, 95%-CI: 0.26-0.97; P = 0.042; compared with other diets including highly-digestible diets: HR 0.35, 95%-CI: 0.17-0.71; P = 0.004).",

Retrospective analysis of prevalence and clinical significance of hypo-or hyperfolataemia in dogs with chronic enteropathies A. Petrelli, S. Salavati Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies and the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Assessment of serum folate (SF) is routinely performed in dogs with chronic enteropathies (CE), most often in conjunction with serum cobalamin. Traditionally, their combination has been used to differentiate intestinal malabsorption from dysbiosis. Despite the fact that the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum cobalamin is well documented, the prevalence of hypo-and hyperfolataemia and the clinical and prognostic value of its assessment has not been scrutinised in dogs with CE. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of SF abnormalities in dogs with CE, as well as its relationship to other laboratory parameters and outcome. Files of dogs presented for chronic gastrointestinal (GI) signs (> 3 weeks duration) between 2014 and 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. Exclusion criteria were lack of SF assessment, and supplementation of folate or cobalamin beforehand. 321 dogs (100 FN, 109 MN, 34 FE, 78 ME; median age of 65 m, range 2-171) were included. Hypofolataemia was present in 97/321 (30%), hyperfolataemia in 86/321 (27%), with the remaining 138/321 dogs (43%) having normal SF values. Initially, dogs were divided into groups according to the final diagnosis: CE (n = 215), other GI disease (n = 76), non-GI disease (n = 30). SF values were not significantly different across those groups (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.83). When dividing CE dogs into different subgroups of food-(FRE), antibiotic-(ARE), steroid-responsive (SRE) or protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), no difference in SF values was observed (ANOVA, P = 0.92). When all dogs were grouped by their SF status (low, normal, high), significant differences in serum cobalamin (P = 0.001), alkaline phosphatase (p = 0.01), cholesterol (p = 0.03) and total calcium (p = 0.01) were identified (ANOVA, Dunn's post hoc test). Multivariate analysis confirmed the correlation between SF and cobalamin (P = 0.009), as well as cholesterol (P = 0.028) and total calcium (p = 0.038). However, none of these correlations were linear (Spearman, all P > 0.05). Kaplan Maier analysis of follow-up and survival times by SF status showed no significant differences. In conclusion, SF was not associated with GI disease or subgroup of CE. Improvement of clinical signs or survival was not associated with SF status. In this study, no diagnostic or prognostic benefit of assessing SF in dogs with chronic GI signs could be detected. Future prospective studies should assess if folate supplementation in the 30% of CE dogs with hypofolataemia can accelerate clinical improvement or influence outcome/ prognosis.",

            "text": "Acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS) in dogs is often treated with antibiotics due to the potential risk of bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract to the blood stream. However, recent studies indicate that antibiotics are not always necessary. According to the Danish antibiotic use guidelines for companion animals 2012, antibiotics are not recommended for routine treatment of AHDS but only indicated in hospitalized dogs with severely affected overall condition and signs of systemic inflammation (SIRS)/sepsis. The aim of this study was to evaluate severity of disease and outcome in hospitalized dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea that did not receive antibiotics. The study was performed as a retrospective, observational study based on information from medical records for dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea of unknown aetiology, hospitalized at the University Hospital for Companion Animals during the period 25/2-2014 to 9/10-2018. Signalments, concurrent diseases, clinical disease at the time of hospitalization and during each consecutive day, treatment prior to and during hospitalization, days of hospitalization/euthanasia and laboratory results were registered for each patient. Clinical disease was scored according to the AHDS-scoring system from 0-18 and the number of SIRS criteria (tachycardia (HR > 120), tachypnea (RR > 40), hyper or hypothermia (T > 39.0 C or < 37.5 C), leucocytosis (WBC > 18*10 9 / L), leukopenia (WBC < 5*10 9 /L, band neutrophilia and/or hypoglycaemia [glucose <4 mmol/L]) were recorded. One-hundred and seventy-two dogs were excluded from the analysis due to suspected drug induced disease (vaccination(s) (N = 4), anaesthetics (N = 5), corticosteroids or NSAIDs (N = 81)), alimentary foreign body (N = 5) or treatment with antibiotics during hospitalization (N = 128). Of the 128 dogs, where an obvious cause for the diarrhoea were not found and that only received supportive treatment (intravenous fluid therapy N = 128; antiemetics N = 98; gastroprotectants N = 107), 98% survived to discharge (125/128 dogs). Two dogs were euthanized due to financial constraints and reluctance from the owner to proceed with further treatment due to advanced age and one brachycephalic dog suffered a respiratory crisis with respiratory arrest nonresponsive to resuscitation. The surviving 125 dogs were hospitalized for an average of 1.7 days (range 1-4 days) with a mean AHDS-score of 12 at hospitalization (range 4-16). The mean AHDS-score after 24 hours of hospitalization was 5.5 (range 0-14). 29% (37/128) of the ABSTRACTS 341 dogs met \u22652 SIRS criteria during hospitalization. None of the 128 dogs had a degenerative left-shift. These results suggest that antimicrobial therapy in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea may not always be necessary in dogs even when 2 or more SIRS-criteria are met. Recent studies have shown alterations in faecal bile acid (BA) profiles in dogs with chronic enteropathy, potentially contributing to clinical signs. The study aim was to assess faecal BA concentrations in dogs with acute haemorrhagic diarrhoea syndrome (AHDS-D) over time and to compare it to that of healthy control dogs (HC-D). Twenty-five AHDS-D and 53 HC-D were enrolled. Faecal BA concentrations were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry on days 0, 2, 7, and 14 in AHDS-D, and on day 0 in HC-D. Statistical analysis was performed with Friedman test for comparison of BA over time in AHDS-D, and unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney-test for comparison between AHDS-D and HC-D (P < 0.05). On day 0, concentration of lithocholic acid was significantly lower in AHDS-D than in HC-D (p < 0.001). On day 2, total faecal BA were significantly increased in AHDS-D (p < 0.001) compared to HC-D. More precisely, primary BA were significantly increased in AHDS-D on day 2 (P = 0.034) with significantly higher concentration of cholic acid (p = 0.004), while secondary BA were significantly decreased (p < 0.001) with significantly lower concentrations of deoxycholic acid (p < 0.001) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (p < 0.001). Dogs in AHDS-D showed a significant decrease in total primary BA concentrations (P = 0.021) with significantly lower concentrations of cholic acid (P = 0.027) and deoxycholic acid (p = 0.021) on day 14 compared to day 2. In conclusion, AHDS-D show alterations in faecal BA profiles compared to HC-D. However, faecal BA profiles normalize rapidly suggesting that BA dysmetabolism does not seem to play a major role in the pathophysiology of AHDS. Pimobendan is frequently used off-label for treatment of cats with congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary hypertrophy cardiomyopathy (HCM). Concerns exist regarding the safety of pimobendan in the subset of cats with HCM and dynamic outflow tract obstruction (HOCM). The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety and tolerability of pimobendan in cats with CHF secondary to HOCM compared with nonobstructive HCM.",

Compared to cats with HCM, cats with HOCM were more likely to manifest CHF as pulmonary edema (44/47 versus 32/47; P = 0.003) and less likely to have pleural effusion (13/47 versus 25/47; P = 0.02). Other than a higher incidence of heart murmurs in cats with HOCM (P < 0.001), clinical variables did not differ between groups. Pimobendan was typically initiated on the date of CHF diagnosis (median time from diagnosis of CHF to initiation of pimobendan was 0 days). Initial dose of pimobendan was 0.25 +/\u2212 0.07 mg/kg every 12 hours; dose (or frequency) was escalated at some point during CHF management in 31/94 (33%) of cases, with no difference between HOCM and HCM cats. Clinical signs that could potentially represent adverse effects of pimobendan (vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, lethargy, new-onset arrhythmias) were noted in 13/47 (28%) HCM cats and 9/47 (19%) HOCM cats (P = 0.34). Based on patterns of timing and resolution, these signs were generally ascribed to recurrence of CHF rather than pimobendan administration. Pimobendan was discontinued due to adverse effects in only 1 cat with nonobstructive HCM that experienced lethargy and nausea 2-3 hours following pimobendan administration (resolved when pimobendan discontinued). Pimobendan was discontinued in 7 additional cats, either because owners were unable to administer the medication (n = 2) or because CHF had resolved (n = 5 cases where CHF was precipitated by an acute external event, such as fluid overload or injectable glucocorticoid administration). No cats experienced acute adverse hemodynamic effects (hypotension, cardiovascular collapse) following pimobendan administration. Results of this study suggest that pimobendan is well-tolerated in cats with cardiomyopathy and CHF, regardless of presence of dynamic outflow tract obstruction. Systolic heart murmurs (SM) are commonly diagnosed in healthy cats. The aim of this study was to determine whether the aorto-septal angle (AoSA) is associated with SM in cats. More, we hypothesised that SM are related to the presence of septal bulge, systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM) and increased aortic flow velocity (AoV). Between November 2014 and February 2018, 316 client owned cats referred for a cardiology evaluation were prospectively examined. Regardless the presence of a systolic murmur, cats with a ABSTRACTS",

The AoSA was measured from the right parasternal five chambers view, based on the published guidelines in the dog. A total of 316 cats were examined, 122 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A left parasternal SM was found in 39 cats (32%). In 10 cats the murmur was audible only after stressed auscultation. SM were associated with a narrower AoSA (P < 0.001), higher prevalence of IBSH (P < 0.01) and higher AoV (P < 0.001), compare to cats without a murmur. The IBSH increases with aging, with an increase of 0,11 mm per year. The AoSA decreases with aging (P < 0.001), with a reduction of 0.55 per year. The AoSA was narrower in cats with IBSH (P < 0.001) and IBSH was always present in cats with AoSA<120 . The AoSA did not differ between cats with or without SAM (P = 0.853). There was a non-linear correlation between AoSA and AoV. In conclusion AoSA angle and the remodeling of the interventricular septum may be correlated and can be a cause of systolic murmur in apparently healthy cats.

Spalla, G.A. Smith, D.J. Connolly Royal Veterinary College, Potters Bar, United Kingdom Third degree atrioventricular block (AVB) is characterised by complete atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, causing independent atrial and ventricular rhythms. Persistent third degree AVB (PAVB) is most commonly described. Another form of AVB, where AV dissociation is intermittent (IAVB) is also recognised. In cats, AVB can be associated with underlying cardiac or systemic diseases. When present, clinical signs associated with these forms of AVB can include weakness, lethargy and syncope. If clinical signs and in particular syncope are present, epicardial pacemaker implantation represents an effective treatment. The aim of the study was to retrospectively assess presentation, echocardiographic data, comorbidities and outcome from cats diagnosed with AVB (PAVB or IAVB) in a single referral hospital, including those that underwent pacemaker implantation. Non parametric testing and Kaplan Meier curves with log rank testing were performed. Sixty-four cats were included over a 12-year period.",

            "text": "Biomarker discovery in cats with cardiomyopathy Cardiomyopathies are frequent in cats and their diagnosis relies on a combination of physical examination, thoracic radiography, electrocardiography and echocardiography. Additionally, in the last decade, assays to measure circulating biomarkers of heart disease, such as cardiac troponin I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), have become available for cats. These assays have been proven useful in the diagnosis of feline cardiomyopathies, although in certain cases they may be less reliable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect new circulating proteins that may improve the identification of cats affected by cardiomyopathy using biomarker discovery. Client-owned cats were prospectively enrolled. Evaluation comprised complete blood count and biochemical profile with T4 determination, blood pressure measurement, thoracic radiography and echocardiography. Based on diagnosis, cats were allocated to 5 groups, namely symptomatic cardiomyopathy with signs of congestive heart failure (group CM-Sx), asymptomatic cardiomyopathy (group CM-aSx), respiratory diseases (group Resp-Ds), systemic diseases without systemic hypertension (group Sys-Ds), and healthy controls (group Healthy). Plasma samples were processed untreated or following enrichment in low-abundant proteins, submitted to mass spectrometry and their protein profiles compared with statistical software. Putative biomarkers were evaluated by western immunoblotting experiments. Eighty-nine cats were included; 9 in 30 in Sys-Ds and 27 in Healthy. In CM-Sx, 7/9 cats had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 2/9 restrictive cardiomyopathy; lung edema was identified in 7, pleural effusion and aortic thromboembolism in 2. In CM-aSx, all cats had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. By mass spectrometry, several differential proteins were identified among groups. Putative biomarkers were tested by western immunoblotting and 2 of them (Protein 1 and Protein 2), were differentially detected in CM-Sx, compared to the others. In particular, Protein 1 was identified in 6/9 (66.7%) cats in CM-Sx, while plasma samples from cats in CM-aSx, Resp-Ds, Sys-Ds and Healthy had a visible band in 2/9 (22.2%), 2/14 (14.3%), 1/30 (3.3%) and 1/27 (3.7%), respectively (P < 0.001). Protein 2 was detected in the plasma of 4/9 (44.4%) cats in CM-Sx, 1/9 (11.1%) in CM-aSx and 1/30 (3.3%) in Sys-Ds, while no bands were detected in Resp-Ds and Healthy (P = 0.005).

We have also observed that a similar phenomenon can be reproduced by gently pressing the stethoscope head against the right wall of the chest, inducing an audible murmur during auscultation.

Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis-of-variance-by-ranks test was used to evaluate difference between position and delta wave measured on each lead.",

Santilli Clinica Veterinaria Malpensa, Samarate, Italy Subvalvular pulmonic stenosis (SPS) is classified into two subtypes: infundibular (ISPS) and sub-infundibular (SISPS). ISPS can be primary, due to fixed obstruction of the right ventricular (RV) outflow tract, or secondary to right ventricular concentric hypertrophy caused by pulmonic stenosis. Furthermore, SISPS is also defined as double chambered right ventricle (DCRV), a high-pressure superior chamber and a low-pressure inferior chamber. The aim of the study was to describe the treatment of ISPS and DCRV in dogs and cats with a the cutting balloon (CB) technique. This retrospective study included 7 patients (5 dogs and 2 cats) diagnosed with ISPS or DCRV. All cases underwent dilation with a 8 mm in diameter (length 2 cm) CB followed by dilation with an high pressure-balloon. For each patient maximum outflow velocity (Vmax), maximum pressure gradient (PGmax), tricuspidal regurgitation maximum velocity (TRVmax), right atrial (RA) area, RV systolic function estimation were measured before the procedure (T0) and then 24 hr (T1) and 1 month (T2) after the procedure and right atrial and ventricular pressures during the procedure.",

Previous studies have supported this conclusion but were limited by small sample sizes. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) has been shown to be an earlier, more sensitive, and reliable renal biomarker of decreased glomerular filtration rate than creatinine, which has been found to be influenced by fluctuations in lean muscle mass. The purpose of this study was to utilize big data to characterize the relationship of SDMA and creatinine (Cr) to subnormal total T4 (2015) (2016) (2017) (2018) . Dogs were included if an ACTH stimulation test was performed and post ACTH cortisol concentration was <55 mmol/L. The results of serum or plasma sodium and potassium concentrations at the time of initial presentation were also required for inclusion.

The lack of aldosterone results in renal sodium wasting and potassium retention leading to hyponatriemia, hyperkalemia and a body volume depletion. The effect of aldosterone on serum potassium excretion can be evaluated by comparing urine and serum potassium concentrations after correcting the urine potassium concentration for reabsorption of solute-free water by the kidney.

Genotyping was performed using Illumina Infinium 63 k iSelect DNA array, and after quality filtering, 390 diabetic and 390 non-diabetic control DSH cats, as well as 19 diabetic and 21 control Burmese cats were included in the analysis. Controls were significantly older than diabetic cats (P < 0.0001). Body condition score (BCS) was known for 718 cats, 62% of these were lean and 38% were obese. Stratified analysis using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test within strata defined in the multidimensional scaling (MDS), and logistic regression with MDS coordinates, using BCS and breed as covariates, were conducted for case:control association testing. P-values from the CMH test were adjusted for genomic inflation (\u03bb = 1.187), and feline standard genome-wide significance was set at P < 10e-5. Max(T) permutations were used to generate corrected empirical P-values following logistic regression; significance was set at P < 0.05. A single significant SNP (chrC1:125033967; P raw [adjusted for genomic inflation] = 9.58x10e-6) was identified in the stratified analysis, and a single significant SNP (chrA2:3535683; P genome [100000 permutations] = 2.75x10e-3) was identified in logistic regression. The SNP in chromosome A2 was associated with DM in the previously reported GWAS of DM in lean DSH, but the association with the SNP in chromosome C1 in both breeds is new. These SNPs are located within and close to DPP10 and DPP9 genes, respectively, which are related to DPP4, an enzyme involved in degradation of incretins. This further analysis has revealed new potential candidate genes in both breeds, highlighting the usefulness of this alternative approach to the GWAS analysis. Both DPP9 and DPP10 have been implicated in metabolic and immune functions, suggesting that further investigation of these genes in the pathogenesis of feline DM is warranted.

Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) is more prevalent in certain breeds, suggesting an underlying genetic basis, although environmental factors may also be involved. Notably, dog breeds with low DM risk are over-represented in studies of neoplastic transformation of pancreatic beta-cells (insulinoma). This suggests that beta-cell survival may be an important contributing factor in canine DM, and that similar genes may be involved in canine DM and insulinoma. Previous genetics work in canine diabetes mellitus (DM) has focused on candidate genes and genome-wide association studies, employing a case-control design within individual breeds.

In human chronic lung diseases (CLDs), the LM is altered compared with that of healthy patients. However, whether alterations are a cause or a consequence of the disease is still unclear. In dogs, the LM has been described mostly in healthy experimental beagles. However, in a previous work from our team, an impact of the living conditions and/or of the breed was suspected between healthy beagles and West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). Recent studies in mice and horses showed modifications in the LM according to the living conditions. These modifications in the LM could predispose individuals to certain CLDs. So, we aimed to assess the breed impact and the influence of living conditions, either experimental or domestic, on the LM, in healthy dogs. Results showed that the bacterial load was higher in EB dogs (P < 0.0001). The AMOVA results indicated differences between EB group compared with S and T groups (P < 0.005). Significant differences in relative abundances at the family and the genus level were found. The genus Hydrogenophilus was higher in EB and the genera Brochothrix, Limnohabitans, Parabacteroides and Curvibacter were higher in WHWT compared with other groups (P < 0.05). In each group, specific genera were found as indicators of discrimination (p < 0.05). Bacterial richness was higher in WHWT than in EB, S and T groups (P < 0.001), but there were no significant differences for the evenness and the \u03b1-diversity between groups.",

As their name implies, bispecific ligand-targeted toxins have dual targeting ability that confers greater binding affinity and killing ability compared to monospecific counterparts. eBAT is a bispecific epidermal growth factor (EGF) angiotoxin developed as a second generation biologic drug to specifically target tumor cells and associated vascular and inflammatory stroma for sarcoma therapy. It consists of human EGF, targeting the EGF receptor (EGFR), human amino terminal transferase (ATF) of urokinase, targeting the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and a genetically modified, de-immunized Pseudomonas exotoxin, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis. We previously reported that eBAT was safe and improved overall survival for dogs with splenic hemangiosarcoma (HSA) in the minimal residual disease setting when added to standard of care (SOC) therapy in a single cycle of three treatments. Studies with Pseudomonas exotoxin in humans have suggested that repeat cycles of administration may prolong remissions whereas the optimal timing between administration of targeted toxins and chemotherapy is unclear. The SRCBST-2 (sarcoma bispecific toxin trial-2) study described herein was undertaken to prospectively determine if multiple cycles of eBAT at the biologically active dose (50 ug/kg) given intravenously, concomitant with a reduced interval between administration of the targeted toxin and doxorubicin chemotherapy would be welltolerated and further improve outcomes of dogs with splenic HSA. Eligibility was expanded to dogs with stage-3 HSA, provided that macroscopic lesions could be surgically excised. Treatment included three planned cycles of eBAT, each administered on a Monday/Wednesday/ Friday schedule starting upon recovery from splenectomy, and continuing one week prior to the 1st, 2nd, and 5th doxorubicin events.",

Randomized controlled trials suggest that the introduction of water to distend the lumen of the colon decreases spasm of the musculature of the bowel and pain, and significantly increases the visualization of mucosal texture and the adenoma detection rate.",

A random sequence of GI or WI was applied to dilate duodenal lumen and, in every condition, the same mucosal image of the bowel was recorded. For every dog, two images (GI and WI) were recorded and subjected to a texture analysis by using image processing approaches like skeletonization and entropy evaluation, and to a subjective blind evaluation by three expert endoscopists, considering the architecture and the intestinal texture. No systematic significant differences were detected for the cardiovascular parameters and the texture analysis between GI and WI, except for the subjective evaluation by the endoscopists, who identified the WI images as qualitatively better.",

At time of presentation the dog was lethargic, and echocardiography revealed a mild pulmonic stenosis (DP = 43 mmHg) associated with severe pulmonary regurgitation (proximal width ratio assessed by color-flow Doppler mode of 100%), and secondary major right ventricular and right atrial dilation. Despite medical therapy, worsening of right heart dilation was observed two months later, and a transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation using a Melody\u2122 valve with a pre-stenting system was decided. A contrast-enhanced cardiac-gated computed tomography 3D scan was performed one week before surgery, to accurately assess the pulmonary and coronary artery morphology, and perform measurements of the pulmonary annulus and the right ventricular outflow tract maximal diameters. Aneurysm of the pulmonary trunk with plications of the arterial wall was confirmed.",

The dog recovered uneventfully and was discharged 10 days after the procedure. Right heart dilation disappeared within 15 days. The dog is still doing well three months after valve implantation. This case illustrates that pulmonary transcatheter stented valve implantation is technically feasible in the dog with severe pulmonary valve disease. Stented valves as an alternative to open-heart surgery is the source of tremendous development in human medicine and it can be foreseen that veterinary cardiology will, in some way, benefit from this revolution.",

Clinical veterinarians also replied in the questionnaire survey that a body weight that corresponded to a body fat percentage of 25% was closer to the IBW assessed by their experience. Body fat percentage at a BCS of 3 on a 5-point scale corresponds to 15 to 25%, with a median of 20%. It is suggested that Japanese clinical veterinarians are evaluating their nutritional assessments by setting their IBW higher. It is found that life span can be extended by dietary restriction in dogs. From this point of view, Veterinarians should set IBM lower than their assessment results. Also, there was a large difference in the correlation coefficient between our measured body length and that measured by the clinical veterinarians. The difference was caused by the large variation in body length measurements by veterinarians. In this regard, it may be necessary to create a manual for body length measurement in dogs to improve measurement accuracy.",

OB had elevated serum leptin concentrations that decrease significantly (P < 0.005) after weight loss, however remaining higher compared to CTR. OB dogs showed significant low levels (P < 0.005) of Treg compared to CTR but they did not increase after weight loss. Our data suggested that a deranged immune-regulation, combined with high leptin levels, might characterize obese dogs in the absence of cardiovascular alterations. Furthermore, on the basis of our results we may suggest that probably in dogs a greater reduction in fat mass, and long-term weight loss programs, are necessary in order to restore immunological balance.",

The amount of fungal plaques was considered mild when countable, moderate when partially occupying the sinonasal cavity and abundant when obliterating the sinonasal cavity. A clinical scoring proposed by Schuller (2007) was modified and used to assess the patients prior to endoscopic follow-up: dogs were classified as having no (no clinical signs reported), mild (occasional sneezing, occasional reverse sneeze, serous to mucoid discharge), moderate (mucopurulent discharge, frequent sneezing, frequent reverse sneezing) or severe (severe mucopurulent discharge, stertor, persistent reverse sneezing, persistent sneezing, epistaxis, generalized malaise) clinical signs. The three scoring system were statistically analised and explicitly, we addressed the question: is there any chance to predict the persistence of fungal infection based on the score system outcome? If yes, than that scoring method was considered predictive for fungal infection persistence. A contingency table for each scoring system was computed and the null hypothesis of independence between the scoring methods and persistence of fungal infection was statistically tested by Fisher-Freeman-Halton Exact Test.",

Alonso 2 1 Laboratorios LETI S.L., Tres Cantos, Spain, 2 Centro de Biolog\u00eda Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Spain Dogs are the main domestic reservoir of L. infantum. In Leishmania infected dogs unable to control the infection, a large and uncontrolled humoral immune response is elicited, which is inefficient against parasites. The high concentration of antibodies and circulating antigens in canine leishmaniosis can result in the formation of Circulating Immune Complexes (CICs). Their deposition in tissues has been associated with tissue damage and especially glomerulonephritis and renal failure.",

It was also confirmed the correlation between IFAT titers and CICs levels. In addition, data showed that dogs with more severe clinical signs presented large size protein aggregates whereas higher concentration of smaller size aggregates were observed in non infected and asymptomatic dogs. This fact demonstrates a clear positive correlation between clinical stage and the size of precipitated-CICs. This is the first study correlating the CICs levels with the progression of the disease. in canine leishmaniosis. The measurement of CICs probably represents a valuable tool to not only diagnose but also to predict disease progression and activation in asymptomatic but seropositive dogs or even follow up the efficacy of treatments. Even more, the measurement of CICs as a biomarker of the progression of the disease could provide interesting information about vaccines or immunotherapy treatments to confirm the control of the disease.",

Sargent, T. Wagner Southern Counties Veterinary Specialists, Ringwood, United Kingdom Myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) is associated with failure of the mitral valve (MV) apparatus. In a proportion of affected dogs, MV regurgitation is severe enough to cause an increase in left atrial (LA) volume and pressure. LA function was reported to decline with increased disease severity. Pimobendan, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor exerting positive inotropic and vasodilatory effects, was shown to decrease LA pressure, although its effect on LA function is not well established. This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the acute effect of pimobendan on LA function and mitral regurgitation fraction in dogs with stage B2 MMVD.",

Pulmonary arterial pressure is routinely estimated by applying the simplified Bernoulli equation to the velocity of tricuspid regurgitation (PASP_D). The accuracy of this estimation is unknown in dogs with MMVD, but experimental studies suggest that the method is imperfect. We prospectively enrolled dogs affected by ACVIM stages B2 and C MMVD for which treatment had been unchanged for at least one month. A flow-directed thermodilution monitoring catheter was percutaneously placed in the right jugular vein and advanced to the main pulmonary artery. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was recorded (PASP_C). A second operator simultaneously acquired tricuspid regurgitant velocity spectra to calculate PASP_D.

This case-control matched multicenter retrospective study focussed on clinical manifestation and long-term survival in LAT dogs compared to control dogs with MMVD but without LAT. Data were collected from the veterinary cardiology departments' databases, selecting patients with advanced MMVD associated LAT. Signalment, clinical presentation, echocardiography, selected laboratory findings, the cause of death and survival data were evaluated. Parameters were assessed upon LAT diagnosis (time 0, T0) and at the resolution of pericardial effusion (time 1, T1). Control dogs with similarly advanced MMVD were selected based on quantitative echocardiographic parameters matching those of LAT dogs at T1. Thirty client-owned dogs were included: 15 dogs with MMVD associated LAT and 15 control dogs without LAT. In both groups, 9 dogs were in ACVIM congestive heart failure stage C and 6 in B2 MMVD. Commonly observed clinical signs included dyspnoea, syncope and weakness. No significant differences were found in age (both groups 10 AE 2 years, P = 0.89), body weight (both groups 7 AE 5 kg, P > 0.99), gender distribution (LAT group: 7 females, control group: 10 females, P = 0.46), serum creatinine concentration (LAT group: 131 umol/L AE 72, control group: 108 umol/L AE 39, P = 0.42) or echocardiographic variables between the groups. Mean left atrial to aortic diameter ratio was 2.24 AE 0.4 at T0, 2.53 AE 0.4 at T1 for dogs with LAT and 2.26 AE 0.4 for the controls. Left ventricular internal diameter normalized to body weight at end diastole was 1.15 AE 0.3 at T0, 1.29 AE 0.2 at T1 for dogs with LAT and 1.25 AE 0.3 for the controls. Pericardiocentesis was performed in 3/15 dogs. At study termination, all dogs in LAT and 10 in the control group had died from cardiac causes. Five dogs with LAT had died in the first week post admission as compared to 1 control dog. The mean survival time for LAT dogs was 53 days.

University, Phoenix, United States of America, 2 Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Liege, Belgium, 3 University of Missouri Veterinary Health Center, Columbia, United States of America Vitamin D has important roles in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Hypovitaminosis D in people has been associated with increased susceptibility and severity of illness with a variety of inhaled respiratory pathogens. Sinonasal aspergillosis (SNA) is a common cause of chronic nasal disease that remains a challenge to treat and is associated with substantial morbidity and non-survival in dogs. There is a lack of biomarkers that can predict the development of SNA and treatment outcome in dogs. Therefore, the 2 objectives of this study were 1) to compare serum 25(OH)D concentrations in dogs with SNA and healthy control dogs and 2) to determine if serum 25(OH)D concentrations can predict first time treatment outcome. Nine dogs with SNA and 8 healthy control dogs were in included in the retrospective arm of this study. Serum samples were obtained from these 17 dogs between 2017 and 2019 and stored at \u221280 C until analysis. Diagnosis of SNA was based on presence of compatible clinical signs and per-endoscopic identification of fungal plaques with turbinate destruction and fungal culture. Treatment was deemed successful if there was resolution of clinical signs and absence of fungal plaques on follow-up rhinoscopy. Serum 25(OH)D was measured using HPLC. Seventy-eight percent of dogs with SNA had complete fungal debridement. Seven dogs had follow-up available of which 57% (4/7) had first time treatment success. Dogs with SNA had significantly decreased serum 25(OH)D concentrations (mean, SD; 26.7 ng/ml, 15.3 ng/ml) compared to healthy control dogs (40.2 ng/ml, 7.4, p = 0.03), twotailed t-test).

In animals it is common in chickens and cheetahs kept in captivity. Latest studies showed that transmission of systemic AA-amyloidosis occurs in cheetahs and involves fecal shedding of amyloid fibrils. Client-owned domestic shorthair cats are rarely affected by systemic AA-amyloidosis. Whether systemic AAamyloidosis is common in domestic shorthair cats living in shelters and shedding of amyloid fibrils occurs is unknown. Thus, aims of the study were to determine the frequency of systemic AA-amyloidosis in different cat shelters and to investigate excretion of amyloid fibrils.",

To date, few descriptions of ICGN have been published in cats, with membranous glomerulonephropathy (MGN) being most commonly reported. Therefore, aims of this study were to characterize morphological diagnoses of ICGN by light and electron microscopy in a large cohort of cats and to identify associations with clinical and laboratory findings. Additionally, comparisons were performed with cats affected by non immune-complex glomerulonephritis (non-ICGN). Renal biopsies of cats with ICGN and non-ICGN examined between 2010 and 2019 were considered if both light and electron microscopy were available. Data collected for analysis included breed, sex, age, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) status, serum creatinine concentration, urine protein-to-creatinine (UPC) ratio and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Differences between morphological diagnoses of ICGN and non-ICGN, including tubulointerstitial damage score, were investigated with Kruskal-Wallis and chisquared tests. The likelihood of diagnosing ICGN versus non-ICGN was explored with logistic regression.Sixty-eight cats were included, 37 (54.4%) with ICGN and 31 (45.6%) with non-ICGN.

Hand hygiene (HH) is considered one of the most important infection control measures in healthcare. Recent studies suggest that HH compliance in small animal veterinary institutions is poor, but comprehensive data from small animal clinics and practices in Europe is lacking. The present study evaluated HH compliance according to the World Health Organization (WHO) five moments for HH in small animal clinics and practices in Switzerland using the CleanHands application. Three small animal clinics (A-C), one medium-sized (D) and one small primary opinion practice (D) were included. A minimum of 500 observations in clinics A-C (100 observations per study area: pre-operative preparation area, intensive care unit [ICU], animal housing area, examination area, consultation area) and 130 observations in practices D-E (consultation area and animal housing area) were obtained. The WHOfive moments for HH included: before touching a patient, before clean/aseptic procedures, after body fluid exposure/risk, after touching a patient and after touching patient surroundings. Hand disinfection with alcohol-based handrubs or hand washing with water and soap were considered successful HH procedures. Frequency of HH",

However, studies analyzing the role of HHM in WHO lymphoma types are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of HHM among different lymphoma types and its prognostic impact on survival. In a retrospective study data of dogs diagnosed with untreated lymphoma between 2008 and 2019 were analyzed. Inclusion criteria were availability of WHO type and serum/plasma calcium concentration. 139 cases were included. HHM was present in 14/139 (10%) patients. Most notably only patients with T-lymphomas were affected. 9/14 (64%) suffered from peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTLC) and 5/14 (36%) from T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL). HHM occurred in 43% (9/21) of PTLC and 38% (5/13) of T-LBL cases. 86% of patients with HHM showed symptoms attributable to hypercalcemia, predominantly polyuria/polydipsia, neurological (somnolence, weakness), and gastrointestinal manifestation (inappetence). In dogs with HHM, median total and ionized calcium were 3.81 mmol/l (reference interval 2.4-3.0) and 1.8 mmol/l (reference interval 1.25-1.5), respectively. Under chemotherapy calcium concentration returned to normal in 93% of cases. No significant differences in progression free survival (150 vs. 60 days, P = 0.29) or lymphoma specific survival (170 vs. 135 days, P = 0.42) were observed between hypercalcemic and normocalcemic dogs of both subtypes. According to our results, HHM is not an unfavorable prognostic factor but it is associated with aggressive T-cell lymphoma types.

AAS divides patients into four stages based on localized disease (I), multiple nodal sites on one side (II), disseminated nodal disease on both sides of diaphragm (III), and in other extranodal sites (IV). In comparison to the veterinary WHO staging system (WHOS) AAS considers a splenic infiltration as nodal involvement, but not as a higher stage. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare WHOS and AAS to predict treatment response and survival in 54 canine nodal DLBCL treated with CHOP between 2008-2019. Because of low number of stage I/II patients (n = 3) in both systems, these were excluded. There were nine stage III, 28 stage IV, and 17 stage V cases in WHOS, and 23 stage III, and 31 stage IV cases in AAS. No association between WHOS and grade, substage, B-symptoms and treatment response were found.

Deveau 2 1 IndyVet Emergency & Specialty Hospital, Indianapolis, United States of America, 2 Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine & B, College Station, United States of America Alimentary lymphoma is one of the most common forms of neoplasia in feline patients. Chemotherapy has been the main stay of therapy for decades for feline alimentary lymphoma. Overall response rates reported from 50-92% and overall survival times range from days to >3 years depending on the protocol utilized and the histologic form. For small cell lymphoma, treatment generally has involved the use of glucocorticoids in combination with chlorambucil (Leukeran). There is currently no standardized protocol for the use of these drugs with some clinicians choosing to continue the therapy for a defined period of time (6-12 months) or indefinitely until disease progression in the patient. The aim of this study is to establish a foundation for use of low-dose radiation therapy for feline intermediate and for treatment of intermediate and small cell alimentary lymphoma in feline patients. Exclusion criteria, disease extension beyond intestines and liver. Recorded information included patient signalment, baseline bloodwork, date, method of diagnosis, staging diagnostics, date of treatment initiation with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, any hematological abnormalities, first response duration to radiation therapy, and date of progression and/or death if available for the patient. Ten cats diagnosed with alimentary lymphoma were treated with lowdose radiation. Seven cats diagnosed with small cell lymphoma were treated with 3 Gy total and three diagnosed with intermediate cell lymphoma were treated with 4 Gy total. Acute effects associated with radiation therapy were not observed. Median overall survival time for cats treated with radiation therapy was 1368 days, the median overall survival time for the control population receiving chemotherapy alone was 1161 days. Radiation therapy appears to be efficacious and well tolerated with no clinically relevant adverse effects reported. In addition to the favorable adverse event profile, low-dose radiation was extremely convenient for the patients and clients as a number of these clients have to travel long distances for treatment, monitoring and follow-up. Client compliance and satisfaction improved due to a variety of factors such as reduced number of at-home medications, hospital visits and financial burden.

Although, no specific recent studies about the relationship between US and clinicopathological features and severity of canine AP are available. The aim of the study was to evaluate abdominal ultrasound features in relation with canine Spec cPL, severity of disease and outcome in suspected canine AP. Dogs with suspected AP hospitalized between 2017 and 2019 were prospectively enrolled. AP was suspected based on compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL test (Idexx Laboratories) at admission. Data regarding abdominal pain were recorded and serum samples for Spec cPL were sent to a commercial laboratory (Idexx Laboratories). US was performed at presentation, and every 24 h until 2 days from hospitalization. US was considered consistent with AP if there were hypoechoic and enlarged pancreas, irregular shape and margins, surrounded by hyperechoic mesentery and/or abdominal effusion. Recently developed Canine Acute PancreatitisSeverity (CAPS) score was calculated and dogs were divided into groups (CAPS <11 and > 11. Mortality rate was assessed at hospital discharge. US positivity at presentation was compared with the presence of abdominal pain, mortality rate and CAPS using Fisher's exact test. OR was also calculated. Spec cPL values were US-group). No association between mortality and US positivity was found. Twenty-two dogs (47%) presented with abdominal pain. Dogs showing abdominal pain had significantly higher prevalence (88%) of positive US than dogs without abdominal pain (P = 0.0014; OR 10.22). CAPS and US positivity were not associated, although CAPS was associated with mortality (P = 0.0021; OR 9.3). Spec cPL were not significantly different between positive or negative US at presentation, and 8 dogs had negative US at admission, which became positive afterwards with Spec cPL < 400 mg/L. Interestingly, 4 dogs were in US-group, despite a Spec cPL > 400 mg/L.In dogs with AP, changes in US could occur later during hospitalization, although the presence of abdominal pain at presentation may suggest US positivity. Furthermore, US positivity seems to be related neither with Spec cPL nor to the prognosis or the severity of the disease.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESCG-P-5Gastric mucosal pathology in Belgian Shepherd dogs with and without clinical signs of gastric disease M.V. Candido, P. Syrj\u00e4, M. Hanifeh, S. Kilpinen, T. Spillmann University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland Belgian Shepherd dogs (BSD) are considered at increased risk for gastric carcinoma (GC), mucous metaplasia and glandular dysplasia. In humans, gastric mucosal atrophy, metaplasia and dysplasia are all linked to GC. We performed a prospective clinical trial exploring early diagnosis of such conditions. Gastroscopy with histology of mucosal biopsies was conducted to investigate possible associations of clinical signs, atrophy, metaplasia, dysplasia and GC.After an online survey for recruitment, anamnesis and laboratory minimal database were performed. Canine chronic enteropathy clinical activity index (CCECAI) and signs of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) were used to ascribe dogs in two groups: with or without signs of gastric disease (Group A: CCECAI >1 and/or GER; Group B: CCECAI = 0 and no GER). Gastric inflammation, including mucosal fibrosis and glandular atrophy, was histologically assessed according to standardization guidelines by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.Mucous metaplasia and glandular dysplasia were rated as present or absent.Group A included 20 dogs (median age 9 years [5.5-11.6], mean CCE-CAI = 3.4 AE 2.1), and Group B included 11 dogs (median age 9.8 years [7.6-11.3]). Logistic regression analysis detected no statistical difference in histological findings between Groups A and completely of the diffuse, non-cohesive type, including four signet-ring-cell carcinomas and one mucinous adenocarcinoma.This study in BSD showed a high proportion of gastric mucosal pathological changes, regardless of clinical signs of gastric disease; even GC presented repeatedly as an occult entity. The significant association of both metaplasia and dysplasia with GC supports an indication for endoscopic follow-up of affected BSD. Extensive endoscopic screening seems, however, unrealistic for early diagnosis due to the occurrence of occult disease. To address this problem, research on serum biomarkers for GC should be pursued. Future studies should also revise the diagnostic criteria for atrophy.Keywords: gastric, carcinoma, atrophic gastritis, metaplasia, dysplasia, dog.DisclosuresDisclosures to report.Statement of Disclosures -Marcus ViniciusCandido The author has the following disclosures related to their presentation: Employee/salary: Marcus Vinicius Candido has worked in zoos in southern Brazil, having researched on various topics.

ESCG-P-6 Effect of stem cell therapy on serum cobalamin levels in dogs diagnosed with chronic enteritis without cobalamin supplementation J.I. Crist\u00f3bal Verdejo, F.J. Duque Carrasco, C.

P\u00e9rez Merino Hospital Cl\u00ednico Veterinario de la Universidad de Extremadura, C\u00e1ceres, Spain Cobalamin deficiency is a common finding in dogs diagnosed with chronic enteropathy (CE) due to low absorption and/or bacterial competition. It has been described the importance of hypocobalaminaemia in the long-term prognosis of these patients being cobalamin supplementation highly recommended. Treatment of CE constitutes a therapeutic challenge and new approaches include stem cell therapy. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Extremadura. A single dose of canine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of allogeneic adipose origin at 2-4 x 10 6 cells per kilogram of weight was parenterally administered. A blood sample was obtained prior MSCs administration and subsequent cobalamin checkups were performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months; blood samples were submitted to a reference laboratory (Laboklin, Madrid, Spain). Clinical improvement was assessed at the same time points by the Clinical Activity Index (CIBDAI; clinically normal <3). The data were analyzed using a Saphiro-Wilk test and a repeated measures One-Way ANOVA followed by a Dunns or a Holm Sidak post-hoc test; P < 0.05 was considered as significant and results are expressed as mean AE SE of the mean. At the beginning of the study, 75% of dogs (15/20) presented hypocobalaminaemia (<300 pg/ml; laboratorial reference value). Statistically significant differences were observed between pre-treatment cobalamin values (225.3 AE 26 pg/ml) and those analyzed at 3 (360.7 AE 33.5 pg/ml), 6 (423 AE 55.7 pg/ml) and 12 (602.6 AE 54 pg/ml) months of treatment (P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between pretreatment values and those obtained after one month of MSCs administration (299.2 AE 41 pg/ml). The CIBDAI significantly improved at all the checkups ranging from 8.2 AE 0.6 (pre-treatment) to 0.7 AE 0.3 (twelve months). CIBDAI was <3 for all groups treated with MSCs. Our results demonstrate that administration of MSCs leads to an increase in serum cobalamin in dogs diagnosed with CE. This increase is associated with an improvement of their clinical status and therefore, MSCs therapy should be considered for the treatment of dogs affected with CE due to their positive impact on the long-term prognosis.

ESCG-P-7 Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a biomarker in dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathies A. Becher 1 , J.S. Suchodolski 2 , J.M. Steiner 2 , R.M. Heilmann 3 1 College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany, 2 Texas A&M University, College Station, United States of America, 3 University of Leipzig, College of Veterinary Medic, Leipzig, Germany Chronic inflammatory enteropathies (CIE) comprise an important group of diseases in dogs. Only few biomarkers that can be routinely measured (eg, serum cobalamin and albumin, fecal calprotectin) appear to be of clinical utility in dogs with CIE and can potentially aid in CIE subclassification based on the response to treatment (ie, diagnosis of food-responsive enteropathy [FRE] vs. steroid\u2212/immunosuppressantresponsive enteropathy [IRE]). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was recently shown to have diagnostic and prognostic potential in humans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). NLR also appears to be useful in the diagnosis of dogs with hypoadrenocorticism, but the NLR has not been evaluated or reported in dogs with CIE. Data from 91 dogs diagnosed with CIE (that had not received steroids for \u22652 weeks prior to diagnostic evaluation) at 2 veterinary centers were used for this study. NLR was calculated as [neutrophil count/ lymphocyte count] and was evaluated for a potential relationship with the severity of clinical signs (CCECAI scoring system, n = 65), serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations (n = 65), histologic lesion severity (4-point semi-quantitative grading system, n = 36), serum and fecal concentrations of other inflammatory markers (n = 60), and the response to treatment (FRE vs. IRE, n = 39). Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. NLR ranged from 0.23-54.0 (median: 5.69) in all dogs with CIE. NLR was significantly higher in dogs with very severe clinical signs compared to dogs with mild (P = 0.014) or moderate (P = 0.026) clinicaldisease. NLR was not correlated with the overall histologic score (P > 0.05), but was significantly higher in dogs with histologic lesions compatible with protein-losing enteropathy (P = 0.006). Hypoalbuminemia (P < 0.001), but not hypocobalaminemia, was significantly associated with a higher NLR. NLR correlated significantly with serum S100A12 (P = 0.032), C-reactive protein (P = 0.046), decoy receptor for advanced glycation end products (P = 0.034), and fecal alpha 1proteinase inhibitor (P < 0.001), but not with serum or fecal calprotectin concentrations. Dogs with IRE (n = 26) had significantly higher NLRs (median: 8.41) than dogs with FRE (median: 3.09; n = 13; P = 0.008), and an NLR \u22654.60 best distinguished dogs with IRE from those with FRE (sensitivity: 77%, specificity: 69%).Our findings suggest that neutrophils play a role in the systemic inflammatory response associated with CIE in dogs. NLR (ie., leukogram changes) in canine CIE are of similar magnitude as in human IBD. NLR can be easily obtained during routine hematology, and can potentially aid in the subclassification of dogs with CIE. The potential utility of NLR in the monitoring of dogs with CIE requires further investigation.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.Not applicable.ESCG-P-8 Calprotectin concentrations are increased in the intestinal mucosa of dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathies M.

Moniz 3 , K. 2+ \u2212 binding protein of the S100/calgranulin family, has potential as a marker of inflammation in dogs and mainly originating from granulocytes. Increased canine calprotectin concentrations have been detected in feces and serum samples from dogs with chronic inflammatory enteropathy (CIE). However, intestinal mucosal calprotectin concentrations have not been extensively investigated in canine CIE. We evaluated the mucosal concentrations of calprotectin in dogs with CIE in comparison with healthy Beagle dogs using a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (PETIA) method on a clinical chemistry analyzer. Additionally, we assessed the association of mucosal calprotectin levels with the canine clinical IBD activity index (CIBDAI), histopathologic findings, clinical outcome, and serum albumin concentrations. Intestinal mucosal biopsies were collected from 38 dogs with CIE (duodenum [n = 34], ileum [n = 10], colon [n = 14], and caecum [n = 7]). Archived intestinal tissue samples from 18 healthy Beagle dogs served as controls (duodenum [n = 17], ileum [n = 18], colon [n = 18], and caecum [n = 6]). Data are presented as medians (interquartile ranges). In comparison to healthy Beagles, mucosal calprotectin concentrations of CIE-dogs were higher in the duodenum (332 [91-639] vs. 94 [24-137] \u03bcg/L; P = 0.001) and colon (380 [187-542] vs. 112 [36-196] \u03bcg/L; P = 0.002). Histologic severity was significantly associated with mucosal calprotectin levels (P < 0.05) for total histopathology score, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in the duodenum, and epithelial injury in the colon. Duodenal calprotectin concentrations were higher in hypoalbuminemic dogs than normoalbuminemic dogs (1441 [1098-1748] \u03bcg/L vs. 227 [74-506] \u03bcg/L), but because of the small number of hypoalbuminemic dogs (n = 4) the results were only descriptively reported. There was no significant association of mucosal calprotectin levels with CIBDAI scores or with the clinical outcome. This study showed that mucosal calprotectin concentrations are increased in the duodenum and colon of dogs with CIE. The results provide supporting evidence for the potential diagnostic value of mucosal (or fecal) calprotectin concentrations in dogs with CIE. Further prospective research is needed to assess the value of measuring mucosal calprotectin concentrations in clinical practice, the relationship between mucosal and fecal calprotectin, and other inflammatory markers in dogs with CIE.",

Allenspach Iowa State University, Ames, United States of America Dietary fat composition has been shown to modulate fecal microbiota composition and impact host health. High-fat diets have been linked to reduced fecal microbial diversity, increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, and low-grade systemic (LPS) inflammation. While high-fat diets may modulate the fecal microbiota, there is no data available on the impact of high-fat diets on the canine mucosal microbiota. The aim of the study was to investigate changes in composition of the mucosal microbiota and serum metabolome in Beagle dogs fed two rations varying in their content of dietary fat. Eight healthy adult Beagle dogs were fed a control diet (13% fat), followed by low-carbohydrate diet (1% starch) containing either 32% fat (T1) or 46.5% fat (T2) for 2 weeks each in randomized order. Endoscopic biopsies of the small and large intestines and sera were collected for analysis of mucosal microbiota and metabolomic profiles, respectively, before and during dietary intervention. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a 4-probe array (ie, total bacteria, Firmicutes [Clostridium cluster XIVa], Bacteroides-Prevotella and Enterobacteriaceae) quantified colonic mucosal bacteria into distinct compartments. Serum metabolomic profiles resulting from the different diets were quantified by a targeted approach to analyze samples using mass spectrometry and the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p400 HR Kit. Metabolite changes between diets were analyzed by PCA, PLS-DA, the adherent mucus. There was no difference in the total number and spatial distribution of bacteria within the mucosa of dogs fed control diet versus T1. For the different bacterial groups, sub-populations of Clostridium spp. were significantly (P < 0.05) increased in adherent mucus of dogs fed T2 versus T1. Changes in mucosal bacteria were accompanied by altered serum metabolomes of dogs fed either T1 or T2. Perturbations in lipid metabolism predominated and primarily involved different glycerophospholipids (GPL), including the phosphatidylcholines (PC) and acylcarnitines (AC). Most GPLs were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in dogs fed T2 but not T1 when compared to control ration. Conversely, T2 also resulted in lower (P < 0.05) concentrations of other lipid metabolites and select amino acids. Our results indicate that enhanced dietary fat modified the mucosal microbiota and the serum metabolome of healthy dogs.

The current paradigm of IBD involves complex interactions between environmental factors, such as the intestinal microbiota, and dysregulated host responses. Toll-Like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 recognize bacterial Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). In a previous study, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 mRNAs were reported to be up-regulated in the inflamed duodenal and colonic mucosa of IBD dogs compared to asymptomatic healthy Beagles. The aim of this study was with IBD were included in this study. Diagnosis was based on clinical signs of at least 3 weeks' duration, the presence of a lymphocytic and plasmacytic and/or eosinophilic inflammation on colon biopsies and exclusion of other causes of chronic gastrointestinal signs. Nine dogs were included in the control group. Colon paraffin-embedded biopsies were processed for immunohistochemistry using anti-human TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 antibodies. The expression of TLRs in the different samples was graded from 0 (no expression) to 3 (strong expression) by a board-certified pathologist in a blinded fashion. TLR5 and TLR9 were detected both in the epithelial cells and in the lamina propria cells. In contrast, TLR2 was detected only in the epithelial cells while TLR4 staining was restricted to the leucocytes of the lamina propria. No statistical differences were found in TLRs expression when comparing IBD dogs with asymptomatic dogs although epithelial TLR9 expression tended to be higher in the IBD group (P = 0,054). To our knowledge, our study describes for the first time the pattern of expression of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9 in the colon of dogs and suggests that their expression is poorly affected by IBD. Further experiments are warranted in a larger number of patients and in other intestinal segments (duodenum and ileum) to analyze whether epithelial TLR9 expression might be correlated with clinical activity or histopathology score.

We compared successful catheter placement, catheter insertion, removal time, adverse events, and operation time in the femoral and peripheral arteries.",

Haemoconcentration is associated with lower risk of mortality, while dysnatremia and dyskalemia are associated with higher mortality in human medicine. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the impact of in-hospital diuretic therapy for CHF on selected laboratory parameters and long-term mortality. Dogs with clinical and radiological evidence of CHF confirmed by echocardiography were included. Blood samples collected throughout the hospitalization at presentation (T0) and discharge (T1) were: venous blood gas analysis (VBGA), serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), microhematocrit (Htc) and total proteins (TP). Length of hospital stay, ACVIM class and other clinical indices were recorded. Haemoconcentration was defined as a simultaneous increase in Htc and total protein. A total of 85 dogs (45 male and 40 female; mean age 11.07 AE 2.54 years; mean weight 8.86 AE 6.92 kg) were included. Thirty-six dogs had previous episodes of CHF. Mean length of in-hospital stay was 31.15 AE 17.35 hours. Treatment protocol included a single furosemide endovenous bolus at 2 mg/kg followed by multiple 1 mg/kg bolus/hour until respiratory rate reach 40respiratory rate. Each dog received 8.6 AE 2.8 mg/kg and 11.1 AE 2.9 mg/kg furosemide in 24 and 48 hours respectively. Ten dogs received higher furosemide doses or torasemide bolus. Haemoconcentration was reached in the 33% of dogs. Considering the VBGA and biochemistry results, the number of dogs showing extra-range values (T0-T1) were respectively: hyponatremia (10-23), hypernatremia (13-17), hypokalemia (18-30), hyperkalemia (10-10), hypocloremia (46-61), increased BUN (26-34), increased sCr (3-8).",

We aimed to determine if 25(OH)D 3 and its metabolite, 3-epi-25(OH)D 3 (3-epi), are lower in cats with cardiomyopathy (CM) vs. normal cats, or if associations with certain clinical variables exist. CM cats (n = 44) were enrolled from patients at the Veterinary Medical Centers of Iowa State (ISU) and Tufts Universities; 38 CM cats had congestive heart failure.Exclusion criteria included hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and clinically relevant systemic (including kidney) disease. Normal cats (N) were recruited at ISU; 44 were age-and sex-matched to CM cats, although 56 normal cats ultimately were enrolled. All cats were eating commercial cat foods. CV exam, blood pressure and echocardiographic data were collected; collected serum was frozen until analyzed. 25(OH)D 3 and 3-epi were positively correlated (correlation coefficient, 0.35; P = 0.004). However, neither was significantly different between CM and matched-N groups (paired Wilcoxson rank-sum). Linear regression analysis to assess impact of CM status, age, and sex among all enrolled cats showed age was significant to 25(OH)D 3 (P = 0.0028).Statistical modeling including all variables was confounded by multicollinearity; therefore, one-by-one simple linear regression tested for relationships between vitamin D status and 18 clinical variables. Significant relationships were found between 25(OH)D 3 and age, survival time, azotemia category, left atrial enlargement, and left ventricular fractional shortening (FS). After accounting for age, only FS and survival time remained significant with 25(OH)D 3 . We conclude that vitamin D status in cats is not significantly associated with CM.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESVC-P-9 Identification of increased desmin aggregates consistent with intermediate filament dysfunction in feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy W.C.

Aggregation of desmin and impairment of protein quality control systems including heat shock proteins (HSP) which governs correct cats) were used for immunoblotting of desmin and \u03b1Bcrystallin normalised to GAPDH. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry was performed on transverse sections of formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded LV from another 4 normal and 8 HCM cats. A minimum of 10 images were captured under 40x magnification (5 longitudinal and 5 transverse) were used for fluorescence quantification and protein localisation. Diagnoses were made by histopathology AE clinical assessment. Mann-Whitney's U test, or Spearman's rho test were used and the results were expressed as median (range).On immunoblotting, only one control had a recorded age (5.8 yrs), the other controls were documented as young adult. The median age of HCM cats was 8 yrs(1.7-17). The protein level of desmin was 0.54 (0.27-0.69) in the controls and1.41 (0.59-2.19) in the HCM group (P = 0.0159).

Although some epidemiologic data and risk factors for AF have been reported, no study cardiovascular assessment (ie., physical examination, thoracic radiography and trans-thoracic echocardiography) and cardiac rhythm assessment via routine 2 minutes ECG and/or good quality ECG tracing during echocardiographic examination of at least 20 minutes' duration. For dogs with multiple examinations during the observing period only data of the most recent exam were considered.Selected clinical and echocardiographic parameters were compared using univariable and different multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 2194 dogs were enrolled, including 1280, 588, 290, and 36 dogs in ACVIM stage B1, B2, C, and D, respectively. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was diagnosed in 526 (23.9%) dogs. Atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 59 dogs with a prevalence of 2.7%. Univariate analyses showed that mixed breed, male gender, decompensated ACVIM stage, left atrial diameter-to-aortic ratio (LA/Ao) > 1.6, normalized left ventricular diastolic diameter > 1.7, and presence of PH were significantly associated with the development of AF. Also the continuous variables LA, body weight (BW), fractional shortening (FS), and velocity of trans-mitral E wave (E-max) were significantly different (P < 0.01) for AF cases. After evaluation of autocorrelation and/or interaction between predictors, two multivariable models were obtained. LA/Ao (odds ratio [OR] 14.011, 7.463-26.304), E-max (OR 2.204, 1.192-4.076), BW (OR 1.094, 1.058-1.130), and FS (OR 0.899, 0.865-0.934); and LA (OR 5.28, 3.377-8.092), decompensated ACVIM stage (OR 4.922, 1.481-16.353), and FS (OR 0.919, 0.881-0.959) were significant predictors of AF for model 1 and 2, respectively. An LA > 3.45 cm had sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 89.8% to predict development of AF. Atrial fibrillation is an uncommon complication of canine MMVD and is significantly associated with the more advanced stages of the disease. Increased LA dimension and BW, and decreased systolic function are associated with development of AF in dogs with MMVD. Disclosures No disclosures to report.

The LA diameter is usually evaluated on the right parasternal transaortic short-axis view and compared to the aortic (Ao) diameter (LA:Ao ratio). However, LA dilation can develop in medio-lateral, cranio-caudal, or ventro-dorsal directions. Therefore, the LA:Ao ratio may not be reliable for the early detection of LA dilation. Measurements of LA volumes have been recently recommended in the dog using monoplane and biplane Simpson's modified methods of discs (SMOD) and area-length methods (ALM). The objectives of this prospective study were therefore to 1) compare different echocardiographic methods in evaluating LA volume in a large population of CKCs and 2) to assess LA volume according to DMVD severity. The study population consisted in 160 CKCs either healthy or affected by DMVD (median weight = 9.15 kg [interquartile range (IQR) = 7.8-10.3], male-to-female ratio = 0.95). According to the ACVIM classification, 28/160 dogs (17.5%) had no identifiable DMVD lesions (stage A), 86/160 (53.8%) and 22/160 (13.8%) were in stages B1 and B2, respectively, 23/160 (14.3%) had past or current congestive heart failure (CHF, stage C), and 1/160 (0.6%) had refractory CHF (stage D). Dogs for which mitral regurgitation (MR) was adequate for quantification by the Proximal Isovelocity Surface Area method (n = 107) had a median regurgitation fraction (RF) of 38% [23-55]. The monoplane SMOD and ALM using the left apical 4-chamber view overestimated LA volume by comparison with the biplane ALM (+2.6% and + 10.8%, respectively), and the monoplane ALM overestimated LA volume in comparison with the monoplane SMOD (+8.3%). Left atrial volumes significantly increased with ACVIM stages. Among B1 dogs, end-systolic LA volume assessed by the biplane ALM was significantly lower in dogs with mild MR (RF < 30%, median volume = 0.75 mL/kg [IQR = 0.59-0.90]) than for dogs with higher MR (RF\u226530%, median volume = 1.39 mL/kg [IQR = 0.96-1.56]; P < 0.01).",

The aim of this prospective study was therefore to 1) document hematological abnormalities in dogs with arterial stenosis (ie, aortic stenosis [AS], pulmonic stenosis [PS]) between 2017 and 2019 and 2) evaluate if maximal and mean Doppler-derived trans-stenotic pressure gradients (\u0394P), as well as features of stenotic lesions (number and location), were associated with erythrocyte abnormalities. The study sample consisted of 56 dogs (median age = 1.6 year [interquartile range (IQR) = 0.7-4.0 years], male-to-female ratio = 1.5). The most commonly recruited breeds were French Bulldogs (study population, 44 dogs (79%) had PS and 12 (21%) had AS. The median maximal \u0394P values were 161 mmHg [110-215 mmHg] and 144 mmHg [IQR = 125-176 mmHg] for PS and AS, respectively. Included dogs showed 1 (34/56), 2 (16/56) or 3 (6/56) obstructive lesions: subvalvular stenosis for 24/56 dogs (13/44 with PS, 11/12 with AS), valvular stenosis for 42/56 dogs (37/44 with PS, 5/12 with AS), and supravalvular stenosis for 16/56 dog (only PS). Hematological abnormalities were detected in most dogs (n = 49; 88%), with schizocytes found in 28/56 (50%) dogs (median proportion = 1\u2030 cells [IQR = 0-3\u2030]), acanthocytes in 46/56 (82%) dogs (median proportion = 45\u2030 cells [IQR = 10-226\u2030]), and hemolytic anemia in 4 dogs with PS (hemoglobinemia <12.4 g/dL). No significant association was identified between these abnormalities and the above-mentioned echocardiographic parameters. Three out of the 4 dogs with hemolytic anemia had a maximal \u0394P > 200 mmHg (242 to 412 mmHg). Interestingly, the dog with the highest maximal \u0394P also had the most severe anemia and schizocytosis, and both abnormalities decreased, and then resolved, after balloon valvuloplasty.",

For each dog with AF a control dog, matched for body weight (BW), class of heart failure, and LA dimension as expressed by the ratio between LA and aortic diameters (LA:Ao), but never developing AF over a comparable follow up period was selected. All echocardiographic exams were reviewed by a single board certified cardiologist and several variables of LV and LA dimension and function, and LA volumes were obtained. In particular LV internal diameters in diastole and systole were obtained as absolute values and indexed to BW. LA dimensions were expressed as absolute value and LA:Ao, moreover LA volumes were measured during maximal and minimal LA expansion and at the peak of the P wave, and then indexed to BW. Several indexes of LA function were then calculated from these volumes. Peak trans-mitral E and A waves velocities, E:A ratio, and A wave duration were also measured. LA speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) was carried out and peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS), peak atrial contraction strain, and contraction strain index were measured.Forty-four dogs with MMVD were included, 22 dogs developing AF and 22 dogs maintaining a sinus rhythm. There was no difference in terms of BW (P = 0.803), sex distribution (P = 0.393), and class of heart failure (P = 0.550). Among the tested echocardiographic variables only LA diameter (P = 0.034), and LV internal diameter in diastole not indexed for BW (P = 0.031) differed significantly between groups. There was no difference in terms of LA:Ao (P = 0.097), LV internal diameters in diastole and systole indexed for BW (P = 0.131 and P = 0.406, respectively), and LA volumes and volume-derived functional parameters.

Marchesotti 1 , T.O. of Novara, Novara, Italy, 2 Istituto veterinario of Novara, Novara, Italy E point to septal separation (EPSS) is the distance of the maximal early diastolic motion of the septal mitral valve leaflet (E-point) to the interventricular septum measured using the M-mode recordings. EPSS is an important index in the diagnosis of occult and symptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as recently reported in the European screening guidelines for DCM in Doberman Pinschers. EPSS can be measured from the right parasternal long axis view (RPLA) or from the right parasternal short axis view (RPSA). However, no previous studies assessed if the EPSS values are different using different echocardiographic views. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare EPSS values obtained from the RPLA and RPSA views in different canine breeds. This was a prospective observational study. Dogs were presented to the Istituto Veterinario di Novara for routine screening purposes. All dogs underwent a complete clinical and echocardiographic examination performed in right and left lateral recumbency with a simultaneous ECG tracing. The measurement of the EPSS was obtained from both the RPLA and RPSA views. All measurements were performed offline by the same operator (OD) evaluating 3 cardiac cycles, and the mean values were calculated. A total of 33 healthy dogs were included: 20 Golden Retriever, 7 Doberman Pinschers, 3 English Bulldogs, 2 Labrador Retriever and 1 Czechoslovakian Wolf. This study included 27 females and 12 males, with a median age of 3 years (range 1-8 years) and a median body weight of 29.5 kg (range 22-42 kg). The mean EPSS measured from the RPLA and RPSA view were 4.0 AE 0.92 mm and 4.8 AE 1.2 mm",

Before and after flight events: changes in exercise intolerance, appetite, respiratory rate and frequency of coughing, gastrointestinal signs and presence of syncope were evaluated. Also presence or absence of events related to heart disease post-flying and postoperative discharge rate were studied. All cases boarded the cabin. Thirty-five patients were able to return home (2 dogs without surgery). Two dogs developed events related to mitral valve disease (1 left atrium rupture and 1 pulmonary edema, respectively). The dog with left atrial rupture died before surgery and she did not receive cardiac medications during the flight. The dog that developed pulmonary edema post-flight also missed a dose during the journey, but responded to medical therapy after the landing. Both of the dogs were in ACVIM classification stage D. About 20% of cases showed changes in physical condition (exercise intolerance, appetite) before and after flight. None of the changes required treatment. Two dogs showed gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea) before flight. Three patients developed diarrhea after the flight. Among patients who showed respiratory symptoms before and after flight, 38% showed respiratory distress and 19% showed worseing in coughing. There were 5 dogs with syncopal episodes before the flight; however, none of the dogs fainted after the flight. One dog had post-flight syncope.. Although dogs with mitral valve disease may show clinical changes related to air travel, these are only transient and can be alleviated with symptomatic treatment. Post-flight cardiac disease related symptoms can be prevented by managing the medication time with alarm clock or other devices when travelling across timezones. Avoidance of med-ication errors that may be caused by inexperienced while moving and misreading of the clock due to time difference may be sufficient to avert mitral valve disease related events with sufficient alertness. In conclusion, long distance air travel of patients with mitral valve disease can be safely performed by carrying out routine care and medicainfarction (AMI) is the most common cause of human ischemic heart disease. Its pathogenesis involves atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, platelet activation, thrombosis and vasospasms. Only anecdotal information on canine AMI exists. Postmortem descriptions of arteriosclerosis with myocardial ischemic injury and congestive heart failure are available, but clinical data regarding ante-mortem diagnosis of AMI is lacking. This case series describes possible predisposing factors, clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings in dogs with a presumptive diagnosis of myocardial infarction.",

RETIC-HGB (IDEXX ProCyte Dx) is a new parameter for analysis of having ILE or not. Low plasma iron or low transferrin saturation (%TfS) in combination with either anaemia and/or altered red blood cell (RBC) indices was required for diagnosis of ILE. Haematologic variables, parameters of iron metabolism as well as serum amyloid A were compared between both groups and correlation between RETIC-HGB and CHr was assessed. RIs for RETIC-HGB and CHr were 12.5-18.0 pg and 14.0-19.9 pg, respectively. In respect of iron and haematologic variables, 20/275 cats (7.3%) were classified as ILE cats. Compared to non-ILE cats, ILE cats had significantly lower median values of RETIC-HGB and CHr. Not unexpectedly, HCT, HGB, MCH, and RBC were significantly decreased in ILE cats. Additionally, ILE cats had significantly increased median SAA values. Correlation between RETIC-HGB and CHr was moderate (r s = 0.59) with a small bias of \u22121.2 pg. CHr and RETIC-HGB may be suitable early indicators of ILE, especially when used in addition to parameters of iron metabolism.

IMHA requires a detailed diagnostic pathway as well as a complex therapeutic approach that can include blood transfusion. Unfortunately, IMHA presents a high mortality rate, especially within 15 days after onset. This retrospective study evaluated: a) the clinical and clinicopathological alterations that influenced the choice to perform a blood transfusion in an IMHA patient; b) if blood transfusion could be an additional therapeutic approach; c) application of leukocyte ratios in the prognosis. Sixty-seven cases of IMHA, both primary and secondary, admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital between May 2010 and July 2018, were included.

In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small, single-stranded non-coding RNAs able to regulate gene expression have been shown to play a critical role in the development and function of immune responses. While in circulation, free-serum miRNAs are highly degradable, when transported in mycelial vesicles (exosomes) they become stable (protected from RNAse degradation) and reliable diagnostic biomarker in diseased patients. In 2013, using murine animal the role played by exosomes and miRNAs was explored during Leishmania infection; a reduction in the activity of miR-122, the most abundant miRNA present in the liver tissue, was obtained. Very little is known about the role of exosomal miRNA in canine leishmaniasis (CL); in particular, the interaction between exosomal miR-122 and lipid alterations. The aim of this study was 3fold: 1) isolate/characterize exosomes in canine serum obtained from 6 healthy dogs; 2) evaluate their quality/quantity of exosomal miR-NAs and proteins; 3) evaluate the expression of serum exosomal miR-122 in 10 healthy dogs and 10 leishmaniotic dogs. Blood samples were collected for routine hematological/biochemical analyses on healthy dogs or before anti-Leishmania therapy. Biochemical panel was completed with a serum cholesterol profile (HDL, LDL). Serum exosomes were isolated using a polymer-based kit and characterized by flow cytometry and electron microscopy. miR-122-5p expression was analyzed via quantitative RT-PCR. Differences between the two groups were statistical analyzed. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

However, the prevalence and severity of polycythemia has not been described in detail in dogs with chronic hypoxic pulmonary disease. 44 dogs (median age 11.9, interquartile range 10.0-13.3 years) with chronic pulmonary disease and documented chronic hypoxia (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO 2 ] <80 mmHg on at least two separate arterial blood gas measurements minimum of 1 month apart) were retrospectively identified from patient records. Dogs of sight hound breeds were excluded. The diagnosis was based on thorough clinical examinations including bronchoscopy and brochoalveolar lavage, thoracic computed tomography, lung histopathology or a combination of the aforementioned. Statistical correlation between PaO 2 and red blood cell parameters was analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficients. The group comprised of 23 West Highland white terriers with canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and 21 dogs of other breeds with the following lung diseases; chronic bronchitis 13/2142/44 dogs (mean 173 AE STD 21 g/L, range 121-221 g/L, laboratory reference range 140-203 g/L) and hematocrit (Hkr) was normal in 39/44 dogs (mean 51.0 AE STD 5.7%, range 35-64%, laboratory reference range 38-57%). Marked polycythemia (hematocrit \u226565%) was not noted in any of the dogs.

Proverbio University of Milan, Milan, Italy Component therapy involves separation of whole blood (WB) into its components (packed red blood cells -PRBCs-and plasma), for specific replacement therapy and to reduce transfusion reactions. In cats, blood for transfusion is commonly collected using an open system and administered as WB, in part because of the challenge of preparing components from a small blood volume. Feline blood has a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate; therefore, if the syringe containing collected blood is placed upright, plasma can be removed from the red cells shortly after collection for separate storage of plasma and PRBCs. The aim of this study was to assess the characteristics of feline PRBC units obtained by blood sedimentation both at collection and after storage for 42 days.Blood was collected from fourteen feline blood donors into three 20 mL syringes pre-charged with CPDA-1:blood ratio of 1:7 using an open system. A pre-donation CBC was performed in each donor. The three syringes were allowed to sediment for approx. 1 hour at room temperature. Then plasma was aseptically expressed ; II) percentage hemolysis; III) morphological index (only for PRBC units), scored of 0 to 3 based on echinocyte transformation of the normal discocyte; IV) aerobic and anaerobic blood culture (only for PRBC units).From donor to PRBC units there was a significant increase in RBC count (mean increase +1886 AE SD1399 \u03bcL/10 3 ), Hb concentration (+2.8 AE 2.2 g/dL), Hct percentage (+8.3 AE 5.5%). Significant reduction was found in PLT count (\u2212249 AE 189 \u03bcL/10 3 ). Comparing PRBC at D0 and D42 a significant increase was found in percentage hemolysis (+ 1.2%), morphological index (+ 0.9) and a significant reduction in RBC count (\u2212460 AE 679 \u03bcL/10 3 ), Hct percentage (\u22123.2 AE 3.5%), WBC count (median \u2212 2589 \u03bcL/10 3 ), and PLT count (median \u2212 43 \u03bcL/10). All blood cultures were negative for bacterial growth.PRBC units obtained by sedimentation of donated blood appear to be a suitable blood component for treatment of normovolemic anemia.However storage for 42 days, as suggested for canine and feline PRBC units, resulted in significant hematological changes that could reduce oxygen delivery after transfusion.DisclosuresNo disclosures to report.ESVIM-P-21Bronchoscopic findings in dogs with bronchial vegetal foreign bodies: a retrospective study of 52 cases(2010-2019) J.

They can result in a variety of other clinical signs and endoscopic abnormalities. The aim of this study was to describe the foreign body location, rate of retrieval success, complications, and macroscopic endoscopic findings in dogs with vegetal foreign bodies. Fifty two dogs were included in this retrospective evaluation from the medical records of dogs admitted between 2010 and 2019 for a bronchial vegetal foreign body. Diagnosis was based on direct visualisation during the bronchoscopic exam or after surgical retrieval. 27 males and 25 females were included in this study. More than half were hunting dogs (29/52). Duration of clinical signs ranged from 1 to 1400 days. Cough was the main clinical sign (49/52). Foreign bodies were removed from a right-sided bronchus in 35/52 (67%) cases, from a left-sided bronchus in 11/52 (21%) cases, from both right and left bronchi in 6/52 (12%) cases. Endoscopic retrieval was successful in 43 of 52 cases (83%). Nine dogs needed a surgical treatment. The sur-study confirm the safety and usefulness of bronchoscopy in diagnosis and treatment of bronchial vegetal foreign bodies in dogs.

Since disruptions in the resident microbiome may contribute to disease pathogenesis by modulating immune responses and since microbiota dictates the type of host-fungus relationship, we hypothetized that differences in predisposition to nasal disease in dogs could be associated with differences in core nasal microbiota between breeds. Fourty-six healthy dogs were recruited, including 22 medium to large dogs from dolichocephalic breeds (DC), 12 brachycephalic dogs (BC) and 12 terrier dogs (T). All dogs were older than 14 months. Dogs were living either in rural (n = 21) or urban domestic conditions (n = 25). Nasal swabs were obtained under anesthesia and banked at \u221280 C until batched analysis. After DNA extraction, a PCR targeting the V1-V3 region of the 16S rDNA was performed. Amplicons were then sequenced on a MiSeq Illumina sequencer.

Aspergillus fumigatus is classically recognized as the most important etiological agent. Notably, this species is now considered a \"group\" (the Fumigati group) including several species distinguishable only via molecular exams. To date, few studies have analyzed fungal isolates involved in canine SNA cases at genetic level, showing that A. fumigatus sensu stricto was the main causal species. On the opposite, other species of the Fumigati group (the so called criptic species of the viridinutans complex) have been found associated to SNA in cats (in cats SNA is more invasive and has a poor prognosis, due to the involvement of the retro-orbital space). The aim of this study was to described the clinical and mycological features of a series of 38 cases of canine SNA in Italy. Cases were recruited by veterinarians belonging to ENDOVET (a group specialized in endoscopy). The diagnosis was achieved by a combination of exams (endoscopic visualization of fungal plaques and/or visualization of fungal elements at cytology/histology of nasal biopsies). Fungi were isolated from biopsies and identified by morphological keys and molecular analyses (sequencing of the \u00df-tubulin gene). Twenty isolates chosen randomly were tested in vitro against some antifungal agents commonly used in the dog with SNA (itraconazole, clotrimazole, enilconazole) and other agents more used in human patients (voriconazole, posaconazole",

Different factors, concerning uraemia and HD treatment, can promote oxidative stress in these patients. HD may generate oxidative stress due to several factors, such as reduced dialyzer biocompatibility, extensive contact between blood and synthetic surfaces of extracorporeal circuit, and poor dialysate sterility. The aim of the present study was to evaluate antioxidant enzyme activity between pre-and post-haemodialysis treatment in dogs with acute uraemia, and its correlation with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Ten uremic dogs managed with HD (HDG) and ten clinically healthy dogs (CG) were included. Enzymatic activities of catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were assessed in blood hemolysates of dogs of both groups. In HDG dogs, blood samples were taken immediately before HD, and at the end of HD (15 seconds into bypass at standard blood flow of 50 mL/min). HDG dogs were classified according to IRIS guidelines for AKI. The presence of SIRS and DIC were diagnosed on the basis of emathological, biochemical and coagulation profile according to the recently published criteria.

These changes increase the efficacy of radiation treatment towards a better tumor response. However, the molecular mechanisms of this cellular sensitization have not been fully elucidated. The aims of our study were firstly to screen human and canine cancer cell lines for their sensitivity towards hyperthermia-radiotherapy treatment, and investigate the role of heat-shock protein HSP70, and DNA repair proteins in the radiosensitization mechanism.

Fever and arthritis are clinical manifestations most often associated with LB; other presentations such as renal, cardiac, neurological, and muscular disorders are suspected to be sequelae of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) infection, but were not reproduced experimentally. The aim of this study was to document various presentations of canine LB in North America and Europe. Twenty-nine dogs were included in this retrospective study based on clinical signs consistent with LB and at least positive antibody detection. Nineteen dogs lived in endemic areas in the USA, while 10 dogs resided in Europe. Medical records were available for 28 cases, and a phone contact with the owner and the attending veterinarian was established for the 29th case.",

While understanding is limited, blood transfusions, bloodsucking arthropods, biting and fighting are suspected routes of hemoplasma transmission in dogs. The aim of the present survey was to determine the prevalence of hemotropic mycoplasma infections in hunting dogs from Southern Italy and assess related risk factors. Blood samples were collected from 1433 hunting dogs in the Napoli, Avellino and Salerno provinces of Campania region of Southern Italy, and tested by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for amplification of Mhc and CMhp DNA. The dogs had no clinical signs at the time of sampling. The overall PCR positive rates were13.1% for Mhc and 11.4% for CMhp. Coinfection with both hemoplasma species was found in 4% of animals. Statistical analysis revealed living in Salerno province (Mhc: OR = 2.94, 95% CI: 2.10-4.11; CMhp: OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.61-3.20), hound breeds (Mhc: OR = 4.0, 95% CI: 2.86-5.59; CMhp: OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.16-2.24), pack size more than 10 animals (Mhc: OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14-2.47; CMhp: OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.06-2.44) and wild mammals hunting (Mhc: OR = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.51-4.98; CMhp: OR = 15.7, 95% CI: 8.83-28.0) as associated risk factors for both canine hemoplasma infection. Adult age was a variable significantly associated only to infection by CMhp (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.25-2.97). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first large-scale molecular survey on Mhc and CMhp infections in dogs living in Southern Italy. The obtained data confirm the circulation of these two species of canine hemoplasma within the hunting dog population of Southern Italy, although their pathogenic potential and the possible epidemiological relationships between hunting dogs and sympatric wild animal populations are still unclear.

Olds Iowa State University, Ames, United States of America Though the role of cats as a reservoir for B. henselae has long been established, the prevalence of infection or exposure of cats to other Bartonella species or to other vector-borne diseases remains unreported. Using serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the prevalence of exposure and bacteremia of vector-borne infections (Anaplasmaspp, Babesiaspp, Cytauxzoonspp, Ehrlichiaspp, Rickettsiaspp, Piroplasma,Mycoplasmaspp, and Bartonellaspp.) was assessed in a population of free-roaming cats in a rural area of the Midwestern United States. Serum and EDTA blood samples were collected from 65 freeroaming cats captured as part of a community spay and neuter program. Testing with PCR revealed that 9 cats (14%) were positive for Bartonella species (6 for B. henselaeand 3 for B. clarridgeiae) and 7 cats (11%) were positive for Mycoplasma species (6 for M. haemominutim and 1 for M. haemofelis). Serological testing revealed that 50 cats (83%) were positive for antibodies against Bartonella species. More specifically, 50 cats were positive for B. koehlerae, 47 were positive for B. henselae and 42 were positive for B. vinsonii subspecies berkhoffi. A significant positive correlation was identified between positive Bartonella spp. PCR results and the presence of antibodies against B. vinsonii berkhoffi and B. henselae. All cats that were positive for Bartonella by PCR had positive serologies for all three species of Bartonella tested. Odds ratio analysis of age, sex and weight revealed that male cats were at increased risk for exposure to B. vinsonii berkhoffi. Disclosures Disclosures to report.

Gow Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, Easter Bush Campus, Midlothian, United Kingdom Pathogenic Leptospira species pose a risk to canine and human health worldwide. There is very little published data on positive cases of leptospirosis seen in veterinary practice in the United Kingdom. This study aims to analyze all cases tested for leptospirosis in a UK university teaching hospital between 2011 and 2018. Data was retrospectively collected from a university database; all dogs that were screened for leptospirosis via urine PCR, blood PCR, or serum MAT were included (n = 153). Cases vaccinated within 12 months with an MAT titre<1:800, in addition to testing negative for both urine and blood PCR, were excluded from the positive category (n = 17). Of the remaining 136 cases, 39 tested positive for leptospirosis. The number of positive cases among those tested was 11/30 (36.6%) in 2016, 18/64 (28.1%) in 2017 and 10/56 (17.8%) in 2018; the 3 cases tested between 2011 and 2016 were all negative. Of the positive cases, 61.5% (24/39) had been vaccinated with a leptospiral vaccine within 12 months and 53.8% (21/39) had received antibiotic therapy prior to referral.",

In this 13-year single-centre cross-sectional study, CT reports of dogs underwent thoracic CT examination for various reasons were reviewed. Patients' characteristics were assessed for likely associations with RAA. Radiographic and echocardiographic studies were also evaluated when available. Continuous data were assessed for normality of distribution with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Dogs with RAA were compared with dogs without RAA for the variable gender and sexual status using Chi-Square test. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to analyse age and body weight of groups. The body condition score (five points scoring system) was analyzed using the Fischer's exact test. Nonnormally distributed data were reported as median, interquartile range (IQR), and range. For all statistical analyses, the significance level was set to \u03b1 = 0.05. CT data of dogs with RAA were retrieved from archive and analyzed using various post-processing techniques. RAA location and shape were recorded. Oblique multiplanar views were used such that the area to be measured was orthogonal to the long axis of the RAA. RAA measurements included the neck, maximum height and width. Additional CT features of cardiac and extracardiac structures were also recorded. RAA was detected in 23/10886 dogs having thoracic CT in the selected period of time (0.21% prevalence). Radiographic and echocardiographic studies were available for 10/23 dogs.A mediastinal mass were visible in 2/10 radiographs. Echocardiographic examination disclosed RAA in 4/10 dogs with pulmonary hypertension. The bodyweights of dogs with RAA were significantly lower than those of the remaining 10 836 dogs without RAA (median 8 kg [IQR 5; range 37.6] and median 16 kg[IQR 23; range 116.9]    respectively; P = 0.003). Female sex was also significantly associated with RAA (P = 0.03). Four/23 dogs had also right atrial dilatation.Three different RAA phenotypes were detected: sack-like in 19/23 dogs, focal lump-like in 3/23 dogs, and fusiform in 1/23 dog. Results of CT measurements were: mean of the neck 1.48 cm [IQR 1; range 2.6]; mean height 3.06 cm [IQR 1.39; range 4.85], and mean width 1.64 cm [IQR 1; range 3.1]. RAA is an infrequent (0.21%) and often incidental condition that can have different phenotypes. In this study, female sex and smaller size showed an association with RAA. Further case-control studies are necessary to assess a possible relationship between RAA and pulmonary hypertension.",

Congestive signs were defined as tachypnea, dyspnea and cough that resolved with medical treatment for HF. Medical records of 5122 dogs enrolled in the LOOK-Mitral registry from 1st November 2015 to 31st July 2018 were reviewed to identify dogs with stable ACVIM-Stage C MMVD defined as dogs with CS and unchanged medical treatment for at least four weeks since the first identification of HF. The study population was composed by 186 dogs, subsequently divided into two groups: reoccurrence group (RG, n = 66) and no reoccurrence group (NRG, n = 120). Reoccurrence of CS was defined by resting respiratory rate > 40 breath/minute and/or dyspnea, within the study period, that resolved after furosemide increase. Baseline body weight (BW) (OR:1.11, 90%CI:1.06-1.17), presence of cough (OR:1.98, 90%CI:1.05-3.74), left atrial-aortic ratio (LA/Ao)(OR: 3.08, 90%CI:1.38-6.86), left ventricular internal diameter at enddiastole (OR: 3.41, 90%CI:1.22-9.50) and end-systole (OR: 7.61, 90% CI:2.32-24.90) indexed to body size, mitral valve peak E wave velocity(OR: 3.44, 90%CI:1.63-7.27), and furosemide daily dosage (OR:1.32, 90%CI:1.04-1.67) were associated with reoccurrence of CS in the univariate analysis. The BW (P = 0.0003) and LA/Ao (P = 0.0196) remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Increment of 0.1 of LA/Ao or of 1 kg in body weight were both associated with 1.1 increased odds of reoccurrence.This study suggests that BW and LA/Ao are independent predictors of reoccurrence of CS in dogs with stable ACVIM-Stage C MMVD.Disclosures to report.Dr. Michele Borgarelli receives financial support from Ceva Sante Animale for studies unrelated to this Abstract.Dr. Alessandra Franchini receives finical support form Ceva Sante Animale for her PhD.",

From this dataset, a hyperthyroid treated group was identified, from this treated population a total of 479 subnormal TT4 cats were identified, defined as having a TT4 < 0.8 \u03bcg/dL post hyperthyroid treatment. The remaining cats were euthyroid after treatment. A four-to-one comparative age-matched control group of post treatment euthyroid cats to subnormal TT4 cats was used to evaluate SDMA and Cr pre-and post-treatment. A McNemar's paired test or Chi-square test was used where appropriate. A significant increase in the number of subnormal TT4 cats with an SDMA concentration above the reference interval was found compared to euthyroid controls post-treatment (39.6% (190/479)    vs. 32.1% (616/1916), P < 0.001). Cr concentrations were also increased above the reference interval in a significantly greater number of subnormal TT4 cats as compared to controls post-treatment (25.9% (124/479) vs. 12.8% (246/1916), P < 0.001). In the subnormal TT4 group increased SDMA concentrations identified 13.7% more cats with potential decrease in GFR and reduction in renal function than Cr. This study confirms that a significant percentage of cats with subnormal TT4 attributed to overtreatment of hyperthyroidism have abnormal renal biomarkers as compared to those that are euthyroid following therapy. The big data used for this study supports the importance of avoiding iatrogenic hypothyroidism. The identified association of reduced renal function with iatrogenic hypothyroidism emphasizes the importance of avoiding overtreatment. Comprehensive renal monitoring including measurement of SDMA should be part of routine management of hyperthyroid cats.All authors listed are employed full-time for IDEXX laboratories.Prevalence of 'Atypical' Addison's disease among a population of dogs diagnosed with hypoadrenocorticism D.

Ollier 2 , B. Catchpole 3 , L.J. Kennedy 2 Royal Veterinary College, University of London, London, United Kingdom, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom, 3 Royal Veterinary College, London, United Kingdom Canine diabetes mellitus (DM) can be classified as insulin resistance or insulin deficiency diabetes, with all cases requiring daily insulin injections to control hyperglycaemia. A number of pathological mechanisms are thought to lead to the development of the disease, including immune-mediated destruction of beta cells. Disease risk differs considerably between breeds, suggesting that genetic factors are involved, but environmental triggers are also thought to play a role. In human Type 1 DM, the region of the genome containing the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) MHC class II genes confers approximately 50% of the genetic risk. Associations with dog leucocyte antigen(DLA) class II haplotypes have also been identified in diabetic dogs, but investigations to date have considered all breeds together. This study aimed to identify breed-specific diabetes-associated DLA haplotypes in an expanded data set. Taking the 18 most highly represented breeds in our previous study, we increased the DLA-typing data from 294 to 736 diabetic dogs and from 501 to 1083 breed-matched nondiabetic controls to enable breed-specific statistical analysis.Dogs were genotyped for DLA-DRB1, \u2212DQA1 and -DQB1 using sequence-based typing of DNA (extracted from blood surplus to diagnostic requirements).

Scattered case reports show varied clinical consequences of hereditary methemoglobinemia in dogs. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the metabolic and molecular bases and characterize clinicopathological features of canine CYB5R deficiency. Twenty-five dogs from various breeds were investigated for unexplained mild to severe non-cardiopulmonary cyanosis. EDTA blood was used to determine methemoglobin concentrations (methb%) and CYB5R enzyme activities, and analyze CYB5R3 gene for diseasecausing mutations. The previously documented nonsynonymous Ile190Leu CYB5R3 variant was homozygous in 16 of the dogs and heterozygous in 3 dogs. The other previously identified variant was not found in any other dogs. Whole genome sequencing analysis identified 2 novel nonsynonymous CYB5R3 variants: Arg219Pro (homozygous in 7 dogs) and Thr202Ala (homozygous in 1 dog).The mean methb% was 23.8% (AE11.5 [SD]) and median CYB5R activity was 10.9% (Q1, Q3;5.8,24.1).

Extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL), extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (3CG) and carbapenemaseproducing (CP) Enterobacteriaceae are of particular importance as their easily transmitted resistance genes mediate resistance to many antimicrobial classes. The aims of this study were: to assess the prevalence of MDRO carriage in dogs and cats at presentation to veterinary clinics/practices, to monitor MDRO acquisition during hospitalization, to study MDRO transmission among pets and owners and to determine the duration of carriage. For this prospective, longitudinal, observational study, rectal and nasal/ oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 88 cats and 183 dogs presented to 5 veterinary care facilities and 187/271 animals were resampled at discharge. Participating owners sampled themselves (nasal swab/stool sample). Carriers were resampled for up to 8 months. Nasal/ oropharyngeal swabs were analysed for the presence of methicillinresistant (MR) Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MR S. pseudintermedius (MRSP), MR coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), MR Macrococcus spp. and rectal swabs/stool for ESBL-producing and CP Enterobacteriaceae. After enrichment, isolates were selected on CHROMID ESBL, OXA-48 and CARBA plates or MRSA selective agar. Isolates were identified via MALDI-TOF MS. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested by measurement of MICs and clonality determined using rep-PCR, ERIC-PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS).The overall admission prevalence of MDRO carriage was 15.5%) with ESBL-producing E.coli (5.5%) and MRCoNS (8.5%) predominating.

Pierini, I. Lippi, V. Meucci, F. Battaglia, F. Perondi, V. Marchetti University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is a sensitive renal biomarker whose concentrations increase earlier than creatinine as glomerular filtration rate decreases. So far in humans, SDMA is considered an important early biomarker of kidney dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate SDMA in dogs with acute pancreatitis (AP) and their association with kidney injury and severity of disease. Dogs with AP, presented at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of University of Pisa between 2017 and 2019, were prospectively enrolled. AP diagnosis was based on compatible clinical and laboratory parameters, abnormal SNAP cPL test (Idexx Laboratories) and positive abdominal ultrasound within 48 h from admission. Dogs with a history of renal diseases (clinical records/history, bloodwork and diagnostic imaging), urinary tract infection and/or on hemodialysis treatment were excluded, along with dogs that had received known nephrotoxic drugs (eg. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycosides).For each dog, data about urea, creatinine and urinary output (UO) were recorded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) grading was made based on current IRIS consensus. Canine Acute Pancreatitis Severity (CAPS) was calculated for each dog at presentation and previously described cut-off of 11 was used to divide dog into two groups (CAPS < and > 11). SDMA was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The SDMA was compared between UO groups (O, NO), presence of AKI and with CAPS score groups using Mann-Whitney U-test or Welch's t-test based on normality distribution. SDMA was correlated with urea and creatinine levels using Spearman's correlation test.Fifty-one dogs with diagnosis of AP were enrolled with owners' informed consent. Sixteen dogs showed AKI and 11 of them were oligo-anuric. Overall median SDMA was 13.8 mg/dL (range 0.6-65 mg/dL). Twenty-three dogs (45%), of which 13 in non-AKI group, had SDMA above reference range (15 mg/dL). Median SDMA was significantly higher in AKI dogs (18.5 vs. 12.4 mg/dL; P = 0.01).Both urea and creatinine concentration showed a positive correlation with SDMA level in AKI dogs (P = 0.01 r = 0.6 and P = 0.006 r = 0.7, respectively) but the same correlations were not significant in non-AKI group. No association between SDMA and UO was found. Finally, dogs with CAPS>11 had higher SDMA compared to dogs with CAPS<11 (26.9 AE 5 mg/dL vs. 13.8 AE 1.5 mg/dL, P = 0.03). Based on our results, SDMA seems to be associated with disease severity (CAPS).SDMA correlates well with kidney disfunction parameters (urea and creatinine) and results higher in AKI dogs. Interestingly, about 1/3 of non-AKI dogs presents abnormal SDMA that can be related to a subclinical kidney impairment.No disclosures to report.Evaluation of a point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay for detection of significant bacteriuria in dogs and cats S.S.

S\u00f8rensen 1 1 University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark, 2 AniCura K\u00f8benhavns Dyrehospital, Copenhagen, Denmark There is a need for affordable point-of-care (POC) tests to accurately detect significant bacteriuria in dogs and cats. Such tests may help practitioners in limiting unnecessary empirical antimicrobial treatment while improving patient outcome. The aim of the study was to compare a lateral flow immunoassay POC (RapidBac\u2122Vet) for detection of bacteriuria, to standard aerobic quantitative bacterial culture (QBC) at a reference laboratory. The study was designed as a prospective cohort study. Urine samples were collected from dogs and cats presenting to the University Hospital for Companion Animals. Samples were subjected in parallel to RapidBac-Vet and QBC. POC results were interpreted by six investigators blinded to the gold standard results for coefficient of variation calculations. Surplus urine samples from 79 dogs and 21 cats were included (58% by cystocentesis). Forty-four samples yielded \u22651000 colony forming units (CFU)/ml on QBC, of which 20 yielded heavy growth (\u2265100 000 CFU/mL). POC sensitivity and specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 71%, 77%, 71% and 77%, respectively. Eight of the 13 false negative samples grew Staphylococcus spp.By applying a cut-off of \u2265100 000 CFU/mL, sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values changed to 80%, 65%, 36% and 93%, respectively. The intra-assay and inter-rater coefficients of variation were 1.4-3.23% and 83%, respectively.These results suggest that RapidBac\u2122Vet is of limited value as a sole discriminatory test for urinary tract infection. A negative test result does not rule out urinary tract infection but may justify withholding of antimicrobial therapy pending the urine culture result.",

Caldin San Marco Veterinary Clinic, Veggiano, Italy Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease. Due to the risk of dog-to human transmission of leptospirosis and the need of monitoring urine output in dogs with acute kidney injury it is highly recommended to place an indwelling urinary catheter during hospitalization. Urinary catheterization can predispose to urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate type and frequency of UTI in dogs with leptospirosis and to identify risk factors associated with UTI in leptospirotic dogs.The electronic data-base of the San Marco Veterinary Clinic P.O.A System-Plus 9.0 was searched between January-2008 and December-2018 for dogs with diagnosis of leptospirosis (n = 78). Diagnosis of leptospirosis was consistent clinicopathologic signs, a positive microscopic agglutination test (titer \u22651:1600 in vaccinated dogs, titer \u22651:800 in non-vaccinated dogs or \u2265 4-fold increase in convalescent titer) and/or a positive PCR (urine and/or blood). Dogs with leptospirosis to be included in the study need to met the following criteria: negative urine sediment and urine culture at arrival, \u2265 3 days hospitalization, and a urine sample for cytologic examination and bacterial culture during hospitalization. Dogs meeting inclusion criteria were divided in 2 groups: catheterized dogs (group 1) and noncatheterized dogs (group 2). Differences in UTI frequency between groups was evaluated (Fisher's exact test). Association between duration of catheterization and risk of developing UTI was analysed (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). Age, sex, diarrhoea, antecedent antibacterial and/or immunosuppressive treatment were evaluated for association with UTI (Chi-square test). Significance level for all statistical test was set at \u03b1 < 0.05. A total of 76 dogs met inclusion criteria: 25 in group 1 and 51 in group 2. Overall 5/76 (7%, all in group 1) dogs developed a UTI. Identified bacteria were: Escherichia coli (3 dogs), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 dog) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 dog). All UTI were defined as multidrug-resistant. Frequency of UTI was signifi-OR = \u221e; CI = 2.082 -\u221e). Infected dogs had a significantly longer catheterization time (median = 6 days, IQR = 2.3) compared to noninfected dogs (median = 2 days, IQR = 2.6; P = 0.026). Age, sex, diarrhoea, antecedent antibacterial and/or immunosuppressive treatment were not significantly associated with UTI. Urinary catheterization and duration of urinary catheterization represented important risk factors for development of UTI in dogs with Leptospirosis.",

            "text": "than human or canine urine, thus human refractometer scales may result in falsely high readings for feline samples. There are some commercially available veterinary refractometers that are calibrated with different scales for cats and a conversion formula has also been recommended if a refractometer with human scale is used in order to avoid overestimation of the USG in cats. Two recent studies questioned whether a separate scale is necessary for the correct interpretation of the refractometer readings in feline urine.The aim of this study was to compare canine and feline USG readings obtained by a commercial human refractometer with weight/volume measurement USG data. A second aim of the study was to test whether the centrifugation of the urine samples may have an effect on the accuracy of refractometric USG determination.The USG of thirteen canine and fifteen feline urine left over specimens were compared using refractometry and precise weight/volume mea-surement. All urine samples were clear, pale to dark yellow in color. The bias between the two methods was determined by Bland-Altman analysis. The measurements were performed both on uncentrifuged and centrifuged samples. The effect of centrifugation was evaluated by paired T test. The median (1st, 3rd quartiles) USG of the canine samples was 1015 (1008, 1024). The mean (AESD) USG of the feline samples was 1033 (AE11). There were no significant differences between the refractometric USG values of canine or feline urine samples before and after centrifugation. The mean bias between the refractometric and weight/volume determined USG values of the feline samples was 1,8 AE 2,4. Using the generally accepted feline correction formula changed the mean bias to \u22123,1 AE 3,6. For comparison, the mean bias of the canine samples was \u22122,9 AE 5,7. Based on our results we can conclude that it is unnecessary to use different scales or correction formulas during the refractometric USG determination of canine or feline urine samples. The use of the feline correction formula may result in a clinically important underestimation of the USG. The USG measurements can be performed both on native and centrifuged urine samples if the urine is clear. The inaccuracies of the refractometers irrespective of the species should be taken into consideration during the clinical decision making.",

N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and glutamyl https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-andbiological-sciences/transferases (GGT) are hydrolytic enzymes found in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubule of the kidney being their presence in the urine associated to tubular damage. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic power of urinary NAG and GGT as early markers of renal disease in dogs affected with leishmaniasis using a modified IRIS chronic kidney disease staging. A prospective study was conducted in 5 groups of dogs:17 healthy dogs (C),13 dogs (G1) with an urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UP/C) \u22640.2 <1.4 mg/dL and 15 dogs (G4) with UP/C \u2265 0.41 and CR\u22651.4 mg/dL. Dogs presented to the University of Extremadura small animal hospital with a variety of clinical signs and diagnosed with visceral Leishmaniasis were included in the study. All dogs had haematology, biochemistry, blood protein electrophoresis, Leishmania ELISA (quantititative), abdominal ultrasonography, and full urine analysis and culture (including UP/C, NAG and GGT) carried out.NAG was determined using a commercial kit (Diazyme \u00ae , Germany),GGT by a specific kit from RAL \u00ae (Spain). The results are all normalized to their respective urinary creatinine and expressed as ratios: uNAG/ CR and uGGT/CR.
