Many new molecules or previously approved drugs developed by high-throughput screens appear to have a positive impact on remyelination and neuroprotection and are in the therapeutic pipeline envisaging their use alone or as part of a combination therapy, including immunomodulatory drugs for the treatment of MS (Harlow et al., 2015) .

In the first study (Endoh and Tabira, 1990) , however, EAE was induced in aged mice, in which susceptibility to disease may be significantly reduced. Indeed, in the same setting, also treatment with another thymic protein, the serum thymic factor, showed no effect, differently from that observed by other groups describing an intensive suppression of EAE symptoms (Nagai et al., 1982) . Moreover, thymosin fraction V is a partially purified mixture of 10 major and at least other 30 polypeptides from the thymus gland with extremely varied and important biological properties that may act individually, sequentially, or in concert to influence the development of T cell subsets and that could also mediate inhibitory effects not observed in experiments conducted with single or a mixture of purified thymosins (Hoch and Volk, 2016; Goldstein and Badamchian, 2004) .",

However, these molecules are genetically unrelated while being distributed widely throughout most tissues and play important, yet very different, roles in cells. The active peptides are typically short, highly charged with no or few aromatic amino acids and, therefore, are intrinsically unstructured proteins under natural conditions (Hoch and Volk, 2016) .",

In addition, the post-marketing data on Zadaxin \u00ae (SciClone) clearly confirmed T\u03b11 immunomodulatory activities and related therapeutic potential also in cancer (such as Hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and melanoma), infectious diseases (sepsis, infections after bone marrow transplant, lung infections including chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, and HIV) (King and Tuthill, 2016; Liu et al., 2016a; Matteucci et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2015) and improvement in immune responses of elderly immunocompromised patients (for example for enhancement of response to vaccines) (Tuthill et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Neuroprotection is a well-investigated effect of T\u03b24 (Santra et al., 2016; Xiong et al., 2012) . In spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models, T\u03b24 treatment significantly improved locomotor and sensorimotor functional recovery and spatial learning, as well as increased survival of neurons and OLs, and reduced cortical lesion volumes after neurological injuries (Cheng et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2012) . In vitro, exogenous T\u03b24 treatment significantly reduced apoptosis of the neural progenitor cells subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (Santra et al., 2016) . Moreover, T\u03b24 may also drive neuroprotection in EAE. The EAE model is widely employed in investigation studies of MS since it exhibits significant neurological functional deficits as well as obvious pathological changes, including demyelination and inflammatory infiltration (Procaccini et al., 2015; Eng et al., 1996) . When T\u03b24 was administered as a prophylactic treatment on the day of proteolipid protein peptide (PLP 139-151 ) immunization, T\u03b24 treatment significantly delayed the EAE onset, and evoked a significantly improved neurological functional recovery. Since mature OLs and myelin support axonal integrity and function (Nave, 2010) , further investigation found that robust functional improvement accompanied increased numbers of mature OLs in the CNS of the EAE mice (Zhang et al., 2009) . Since the EAE model is induced by an autoimmune response, the antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of T\u03b24 (Badamchian et al., 2003; Girardi et al., 2003; Sosne et al., 2007) via the suppression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activation (Sosne et al., 2007) may protect OLs from damage and death. In addition to inflammatory cells (which infiltrate from peripheral circulation), microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the CNS, are activated by neuroinflammation and play a pivotal role in onset and pathological changes of disease. Thus, the effect of exogenous T\u03b24 treatment on inhibition of microglial activation after damage may contribute to reduce the secretion of inflammatory mediators (Zhang et al., 2016b; Zhou et al., 2015) , and thereby prevent and/or reduce damage of OLs after EAE by attenuating immune onslaught (neuroprotection).",

            "text": "To further investigate remyelination effects of T\u03b24, the treatment window was delayed to permit the full development of demyelination damage in the CNS of EAE animals. When the therapeutic treatment of T\u03b24 was administered after EAE symptoms' onset instead of on the day of PLP immunization, functional outcomes revealed that this T\u03b24 treatment approach evoked significant functional benefit (Zhang et al., 2016a) , and concurrently increased OLs in the demyelinating CNS. At the early stage of EAE (day 7 after onset), the protein level of myelin basic protein (MBP) and the numbers of OLs were strongly decreased. Conversely, OLs were significantly increased after T\u03b24 treatment, suggesting that the newly generated OLs formed new myelin and contributed to improved functional recovery. This hypothesis was supported by results that also OPC differentiation was significantly induced, axons were re-wrapped, and axonal damage was reduced after T\u03b24 treatment at the late stage of EAE (day 30 after onset), and that OPC differentiation significantly correlates with the neurological functional score (Zhang et al., 2016a) . This T\u03b24 treatment approach increased myelin areas and improved functional outcome in the late disease stage, demonstrating the presence of a remyelination effect of T\u03b24, in addition to its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Complementing the EAE model, an additional demyelination model -induced by cuprizone diet-was employed to further confirm that the remyelination effect of T\u03b24 derives from its direct action on OPCs. The cuprizone model is extensively used to study in vivo toxicity-induced demyelination (Zhang et al., 2017a) with less infiltrated immune cells as compared to what found in EAE (Procaccini et al., 2015) . Thus, this experimental model has utility for directly investigating the effects of a therapeutic agent on OPC differentiation and remyelination. Cuprizone-fed mice with demyelination treated by T\u03b24 exhibited a significant increase of remyelination, accompanied with a robust increase of newly generated OLs, and elevation of MBP density in the demyelinating corpus callosum (Zhang et al., 2016b) . In concert, these results obtained from both the EAE and cuprizone models indicate that the in vivo effects of T\u03b24 on OPC differentiation and remyelination are independent of its systemic anti-inflammatory effect.",

Rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion treated with T\u03b24 demonstrated a significant overall improvement in functional outcome (Morris et al., 2010) . Although lesion volumes were not reduced, T\u03b24 treatment increased myelinated axons in the ischemic boundary, and augmented remyelination, which was associated with an increase of OPCs and myelinating OLs (Morris et al., 2010) . In a model of diabetes-induced peripheral neuropathy, extended T\u03b24 treatment of diabetic mice significantly improved neurological function, and was closely associated with increased axonal regeneration and remyelination in peripheral nerves (Wang et al., 2015) . Traumatic brain injury remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide with no effective pharmacological treatments. T\u03b24 treatment of traumatic brain injury in rats amplified endogenous remyelinating processes including oligodendrogenesis, neurogenesis and axonal remodeling, which appeared to drive functional recovery (Xiong et al., 2012) . In vitro experiments provide evidence of the direct effects of T\u03b24 on OPCs and neurons. After T\u03b24 treatment of primary cultured OPCs, the differentiation of OPCs into mature OLs identified by the protein level of MBP significantly increased (Zhang et al., 2016a; Santra et al., 2014) . Thus, data generated from these in vivo and in vitro studies in concert, confirm the remyelination effect of T\u03b24. Due to the combined benefits in neuroprotection and remyelination (summarized in Fig. 1 ), T\u03b24 is an excellent candidate for the treatment of demyelinating diseases also based on data demonstrating safety, tolerability and efficacy of T\u03b24 in clinical practice (Crockford, 2007; Vasilopoulou et al., 2015; Marks and Kumar, 2016) .",

This characteristic was also recently tested in cystic fibrosis where T\u03b11 increases the altered maturation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and reduces the chronic inflammation caused by the excessive activation of the innate immune response (Romani et al., 2017) . Indeed, owing to its ability to activate the tolerogenic pathway of tryptophan catabolism via the immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (Puccetti and Grohmann, 2007) , T\u03b11 specifically potentiates immune tolerance in the lung, breaking the vicious circle that perpetuates chronic lung inflammation in response to a variety of infectious noxae (Romani et al., 2006) .",

Accordingly, characteristic oligoclonal IgG bands in their CSF are thought to be a quite specific marker for MS (Walsh et al., 1985) . Numerous B lymphocytes were also described together with T lymphocytes, DC and plasma cells in white matter lesions, with a very high frequency in acute lesions (Nyland et al., 1982) . However, new impetus on the central role of B cells in MS pathogenesis was received from the identification in the meninges of SPMS patients of ectopic lymphoid follicles enriched with B and plasma cells, whose establishment in the brain of these individuals could provide a microenvironment in which B cell expansion and maturation, and hence local Ig production, may occur (Serafini et al., 2004) . Nowadays, however, important Ab-independent pathogenic roles for B cells are emerging, also in light of successful results of B cell-depleting therapies in MS (Barun and Bar-Or, 2012) . In particular, selective depletion of B cells via monoclonal Abs against the B cell lineage specific surface marker CD20 (i.e. rituximab, ocrelizumab, and ofatumumab) proved to be remarkably effective in the induction of long-lasting suppression of lesion activity and clinical relapses but showed no effect on plasma cell differentiation and Ab production (Barun and Bar-Or, 2012) .",

            "text": "Importantly, B cells can efficiently present antigens to T cells and modulate local immune responses by secreting soluble factors. In humans, different B cell subsets were described producing distinct effector cytokines. In particular, CD19 + CD27-na\u00efve B cells release mainly the anti-inflammatory IL-10; while CD19 + CD27 + memory B cells largely express pro-inflammatory factors, such as lymphotoxin (LT), TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. In human B cells the effector cytokine profile is stringently context-dependent with a reciprocal regulation of pro-and anti-inflammatory response. In MS, this cytokine network is dysregulated, with a much lower production of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 (Duddy et al., 2007) . Furthermore, B cells of MS patients exhibit aberrant pro-inflammatory responses, with increased LT:IL-10 ratio and exaggerated LT and TNF-\u03b1 secretion, that may mediate 'bystander activation' of disease-relevant pro-inflammatory T cells, resulting in new relapsing MS disease activity (Bar-Or et al., 2010) . The term \"regulatory B cells\" was first introduced by Mizoguchi and Bhan to indicate a subset of B cells with the ability to produce IL-10 and to suppress inflammatory cellular immune responses (Mizoguchi and Bhan, 2006) . Since then the family of B reg is expanding with many subsets identified and shown to arise at different stages of B cell differentiation in a context-dependent manner (Mauri and Menon, 2015) . In particular, among many others, two main B reg populations have been deeply characterized: CD24 + CD38hi transitional-immature B reg arising from CD27-B cell compartment (Blair et al., 2010) and CD24low/ negCD38hi plasmablast-like B reg cells differentiating from CD27 + memory B cells (Matsumoto et al., 2014) . While much evidence indicate that B cell-derived IL-10 production is strongly downregulated in MS patients (Duddy et al., 2007; Bar-Or et al., 2010) , only few studies have characterized so far B reg populations in MS by using different Ab cocktails leading to contrasting results (Knippenberg et al., 2011; Michel et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015; Habib et al., 2015) .",

In particular, differently from studies on purified B cells, the mixed cell population of PBMC resemble the in vivo scenario and, upon stimulation with a specific TLR7 agonist (the socalled Imiquimod), could account for cytokine production as well as triggering of CD40 signaling generating an in vitro B cell proliferating milieu unique for either healthy individuals or patients. By using this setting, our study demonstrated a striking difference in the ability of B cells from RRMS patients to differentiate into both CD24 + CD38hi transitional-immature and CD24low/negCD38hi plasmablast-like B reg subsets, as compared to matched controls (Giacomini et al., 2017) . Very interestingly, in vitro exposure to T\u03b11 drastically reduced the TLR7induced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-8 and IL-6, while increasing expression of the anti-inflammatory mediators IL-10 and IL-35. Accordingly, T\u03b11 treatment restored the ability of RRMS B cells to differentiate into IL-10-producing transitional-immature B reg and regulatory plasmablasts to the level found in healthy controls (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, the B reg subsets expanded by T\u03b11 treatment display a suppressive activity reducing both IFN-\u03b3 and IL-17 production found in TLR7-treated MS patients-derived PBMC cultures (Giacomini et al., 2017) . Unfortunately, there is no evidence on the role of T\u03b11 in EAE. However, Janeway and colleagues first observed that B10.PL mice lacking B cells suffered an unusually severe and chronic form of EAE, suggesting that anti-inflammatory B cells in charge of negatively regulating inflammatory reactions may be depleted (Wolf et al., 1996) . Therefore, we envisage that treatment with T\u03b11, impacting induction of both B and T regulatory cell subsets, may exert protective effects during EAE by reducing disease severity.",

However, our results on T\u03b11 potentiation of B reg differentiation in MS (Giacomini et al., 2017) , together with its well-characterized pleiotropic activity able to shift inflammation toward a more anti-inflammatory milieu depending on the stimuli or pathological conditions (Romani et al., 2012; Giacomini et al., 2015) and its capacity to induce Treg generation and IL-10 production (Romani et al., 2006; Romani et al., 2017) , indicate beneficial and advisable functions for a drug to be used in autoimmune diseases. These data may pave the way for a repurposing potential of T\u03b11, alone or in combination with other approved drugs, for treatment of MS or other autoimmune conditions that display reduced differentiation of B reg subsets and chronic immune activation.",

In particular, immune-modulatory therapies, such as IFN-\u03b2, glatiramer acetate or teriflunomide, could impact the low circulating level of T\u03b11 and/or T\u03b24 in MS patients. Or possibly, the combination of synthetic T\u03b11 with B cell-directed therapeutics, as the specific anti-CD20 mAbs ocrelizumab and ofatunumab or those mAbs, including natalizumab and alemtuzumab, affecting both T and B lymphocytes, may complement their ability to affect the B cell compartment. The profound and rapid depletion of B cells that arises after treatment with these mAbs is then followed by repletion of lymphocytes with a more regulatory phenotype. However, in some cases (as for example following CD52 depletion) there is a hyperpopulation of immature B cells that may be responsible for secondary autoimmunity, a major drawback of alemtuzumab therapy (Baker et al., 2017) . As in the combination regimens of chemotherapeutics plus T\u03b11 adopted for treatment of many cancer types (Garaci et al., 2015) , in MS a combination of disease modifying therapies with synthetic T\u03b11 may help in addressing and correctly modulating the repopulation of B cell compartment towards a more regulatory and anti-inflammatory phenotype.",

Currently, FDA-approved disease modifying therapies for MS mainly focus on immunomodulation, and there is lack of remyelination treatments. In this review, T\u03b24 has been demonstrated to promote remyelination, synaptogenesis and axon growth, in addition to its effect on immunosuppression. In future clinical treatment, T\u03b24 may be employed as a monotherapy or combined with other disease modifying therapies to treat MS patients. Thus, therapeutic approaches should attempt to decrease severity of disease by immunosupression in order to reduce the damage to myelin and axons as well as to promote repair of damaged myelin and axons and, thereby, enhance functional recovery of MS patients.",
