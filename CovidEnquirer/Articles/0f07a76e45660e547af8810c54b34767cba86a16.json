Several measures have already been implemented to prevent and control possible case importations from China; 3,4 however, the ability to limit and control local transmission after importation depends on the application and execution of strict measures of detection, prevention, and control. These measures include heightened surveillance and rapid identification of suspected cases, followed by patient transfer and isolation, rapid diagnosis, tracing, and follow-up of potential contacts. 1 The application of such a vast technical and operational set of interventions depends on each country's public health and laboratory infrastructures and resources.",

Province-level incidence data were linked to the three airports with the largest volumes in each province (figure 1). 12 The province of Hubei was not included among the possible locations able to export the virus, given the travel ban introduced by Chinese authorities on Jan 23 and 24, 2020. 5 The importation risk per country in Africa was measured as the probability of importing a case from the infected provinces in China, accounting for the origindestination travel flows originated from such provinces and for their different epidemic levels (appendix p 2).",

Few studies have investigated the risk of spread based on local incidence of COVID-19 in China at the province level, international air travel to countries in Africa, local capacity to detect the outbreak, and capacity to contain the outbreak successfully.",

Previous and current evidence indicates that realistic travel restrictions would have a limited effect in containing the epidemic and would delay the risk that the outbreak extends to new countries by only a few weeks. 8, 22, 23 Travel or trade restrictions are not currently recommended by WHO. 1 Algeria, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Nigeria were part of the 13 top priority countries identified by WHO on the basis of their direct links and volume of travel to China. 4 Egypt, which we estimated to be at highest risk, was not part of that list, although Cairo was identified as the African airport with the highest passenger volume from the affected areas. 9 Few other discrepancies were observed (Morocco and Angola were estimated to be at moderate risk, but did not appear in WHO's 13 top priority list) that might be explained by different risk estimation approaches. In our assessment, we accounted for the distribution of incidence within China and the volume of travel from China with the passenger network. This assessment strongly affects the spatial pattern in the risk of importation. In addition, we considered full origindestination itineraries as opposed to direct flights only. Yet our data do not allow us to distinguish between travel for tourism or business, or across nationalities of passengers. Contrary to Europe, where most cases among initial importations were Chinese tourists travelling for holiday, cases in Africa might be more likely to be business than travel related, given the strong commercial links between African countries and China.",

Some are without the diagnostic capacity for rapid testing for the virus; thus, if cases are imported, tests will need to be done abroad, which might critically increase the delay from identification of suspected cases to their confirmation and isolation, affecting possible disease transmission. WHO is currently supporting countries to improve their diagnostic capacity. In the African region, this capacity has now expanded from just two referral laboratories 4 to a larger set of countries, and is expected to continue to increase in the upcoming weeks. 25 The capacity of these laboratories is still limited by the shortage of personnel trained to run the tests, and inadequate stock of materials needed to do these tests.
