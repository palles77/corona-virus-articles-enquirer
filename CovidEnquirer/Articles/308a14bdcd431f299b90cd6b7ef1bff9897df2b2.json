Early signs of the value of convalescent blood therapy against Ebola were revealed by the recovery of a British laboratory worker in 1977, with occupational exposure to EVD, after treatment with convalescent serum and human interferon 1 and by 1979 convalescent plasma was considered a 'specific treatment' for Ebola. 2 Further evidence of the value of convalescent blood therapy (CBT) was provided by Mupapa and colleagues in 1995 3 after treating eight subjects with CWB, and only one of them died. The treated patients may have already developed antibodies for EVD and the recovery of the patients was not wholly attributable to the CWB, but it could not also be ruled out as the primary cause of the recovery.",

Also, an experiment was conducted to test the effectiveness of convalescent whole blood on na\u20ac \u0131ve monkeys that had been infected with EVD, but it did not lead to recovery, 5 creating further doubt on the efficacy of CWB. Again, the volume of CWB used (6 ml/kg) may not have been sufficient enough to cause a recovery in the monkeys and the blood used was obtained after 30 days of reinfection of convalescent monkeys with 1000 pfu of the EVD virus.",

Additionally, severe pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus infection 12 and even Ebola 13, 14 have benefitted from CWB during their onsets, but no recent report on CWB for Ebola has been reported.",

CWB is easier to use and adaptable for application in resource-poor settings with limited kits and burden of hard-to-treat diseases such as EVD. The blood may only require screening for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) such as viral hepatitis and HIV and to ensure that the blood is safe and matching the ABO blood groups of recipients. In the case of convalescent plasma, its use may require plasmapheresis, which is the separation of blood cells from the liquid plasma, before use. Also, the IgG in plasma could be enriched by fractionation. 15 In resource-poor environments, lacking basic amenities and prone to diseases such as Ebola, the use of CWB is important. In recognition of this fact, the World Health Organisation (WHO) in September 2014, provided interim guidance for the evaluation of CWB and CBP for the treatment of EVD. 20 However, little research has been done on CBT, and the few studies done had a small sample size. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of CWB in the treatment of infected patients using a non-randomised study design.",

There was no adverse reaction from the transfusions. To prevent adverse reactions, ABO compatibility tests were done on the donated blood, the collection date recorded and the donor ID recorded on the blood bag (Fig. 1) . The blood was obtained and tested by blood services technicians of the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation from 60 consented blood donors that had recovered from Ebola in Kenema Town, Eastern Sierra Leone. Donated blood was obtained after three months of recovery. The earlier cases of the epidemic in Sierra Leone affected people from Eastern Sierra Leone, so it was easier to get convalescent blood donors that had recovered over 3 months at the time of blood collection. The average age of the blood donors was 28 (AE26.2) years, 35 were females, and 25 were males. Apart from being clinically asymptomatic and testing negative twice by PCR for Ebola prior to discharge, the blood of donors was again screened using ELISA at the Kenema Government Lassa Fever Laboratory to ensure that there were no Ebola antigens. Donated blood was also screened for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) using SD Bioline (Standard Diagnostics, Seoul, Korea) lateral flow immunoassays for viral hepatitis, syphilis and HIV and also Alere Determine\u00e4 HIV-1/2 (Alere Medical Co Ltd.
