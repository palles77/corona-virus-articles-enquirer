            "text": "In 1995, in agreement with the German Federal Ministry of Health, the Robert Koch Institute established a public health microbiology system consisting of national reference centers (NRCs) and consultant laboratories (CLs). The goal was to improve the efficiency of infection protection by advising the authorities on possible measures and to supplement infectious disease surveillance by monitoring selected pathogens that have high public health relevance. Currently, there are 19 NRCs and 40 CLs, each appointed for three years. In 2009, an additional system of national networks of NRCs and CLs was set up in order to enhance effectiveness and cooperation within the national reference laboratory system. The aim of these networks was to advance exchange in diagnostic methods and prevention concepts among reference laboratories and to develop geographic coverage of services. In the last two decades, the German public health laboratory reference system coped with all major infectious disease challenges. The European Union and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) are considering implementing a European public health microbiology reference laboratory system. The German reference laboratory system should be well prepared to participate actively in this upcoming endeavor.",

They have important roles and responsibilities associated with accurate diagnosis, resistance testing and prevention of the spread of infectious disease. For example, outbreak investigations often depend on confirming cases by methods that are not commonly available in a routine laboratory setting. The scientific community, policy makers and pharmaceutical companies rely on advice and information from reference laboratories in order to adjust vaccine and antibiotic production (Witze et al., 2014) . According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the five key activities of public health microbiology reference laboratories are reference diagnostics; reference material resources; scientific advice; collaboration and research; and monitoring, alerting and responding (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2010) . In the various European countries, microbiology reference laboratories are defined, organized, maintained and operated differently. We present an overview of Germany's public health reference laboratory system.",

The principal responsibility for public health lies with the 16 states, or with their ministries of health, and with the almost 400 local public health departments. Since the 1980s, the federal government (\"Bundesregierung\"), federal assembly (\"Bundestag\") and federal council (\"Bundesrat\") have increasingly taken responsibility for healthcare reform and legislation. Specific health issues, such as infectious diseases that threaten public safety and life cycle management of pharmaceuticals, are within the jurisdiction of the federal government.

In former West Germany, the work of the RKI as part of the then Federal Health Office (Bundesgesundheitsamt, BGA) mainly focused on basic science research. The AIDS epidemic demanded a national public health response which resulted in the creation of the National AIDS Centre in 1988. In 1994, when the BGA was dissolved and the RKI was assigned additional spheres of competence a combined AIDS center and infectious disease epidemiology division was created at the RKI. In 1995, representatives of the RKI, the Federal Ministry of Health and the Federal Ministry for Education and Research developed the concept of a network of collaborators whose goal was to intensify epidemiological research and improve infectious disease surveillance (Fock et al., 1995) . As part of this concept, the RKI implemented a weekly epidemiological bulletin, formed the Committee for Infectious Disease Epidemiology, trained epidemiologists for surveillance and outbreak investigation and set up a system of national reference laboratories: national reference centers (NRCs) and consultant laboratories (CLs) (Petersen et al., 2000) . They were responsible for laboratory surveillance of important pathogens and syndromes. These laboratories are considered national centers of excellence in the field of laboratory science for a particular pathogen or group of pathogens.",

For example, the NRC for mycobacteria and the RKI performed analyses of routine laboratory diagnosis data of pediatric tuberculosis in the European Union/European Economic Area (Sanchini et al., 2014) . The NRC for Helicobacter pylori and the RKI examined H. pylori resistance to antibiotics in Europe and its relationship to antibiotic consumption (Megraud et al., 2013) . Another example is the work of the streptococci NRC, which studied the epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumoniae Serogroup 6 isolates from invasive pneumococcal disease in children and adults in Germany (van der Linden et al., 2013) . NRCs and CLs are also involved in outbreak investigations and epidemiological studies. For instance, the CL for coronaviruses performed contact investigation for an imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Reuss et al., 2014) , and the influenza NRC was involved in detecting local influenza outbreaks (Schweiger and Buda, 2013) . The RKI and the NRC for surveillance of nosocomial infections examined the question, \"How many outbreaks of nosocomial infections occur in German neonatal intensive care units annually?\" (Schwab et al., 2014) . Additionally, the CL for legionella was involved in examining a Legionnaires' disease outbreak associated with a cruise liner in August 2003 (Beyrer et al., 2007) . Dengue virus infections in a traveler returning from Croatia to Germany were analyzed by the NRC for tropical infection agents (Schmidt-Chanasit et al., 2010) . The NRC and the RKI for meningococcal diseases and H. influenzae examined a cluster of invasive meningococcal disease in young men who have sex with men in Berlin (Marcus et al., 2013) .

In addition, medical professional societies, the Federal Ministry of Health and other third parties can approach the RKI with perceived needs for additional reference laboratories. In the next step, the Advisory Board for Public Health Microbiology (formerly called the Committee for Infectious Disease Epidemiology) assesses the proposal and provides the RKI with a recommendation on whether to set up a new laboratory. In addition to the epidemiological relevance, and a declared need from national public health services, the availability of financial resources is another essential criterion. The decision to establish or continue an NRC or a CL is made by the RKI, which considers recommendations given by the Advisory Board for Public Health Microbiology, and must be confirmed by the Federal Ministry of Health. Appointments are restricted to three-year periods. The advisory board consists of up to 14 experts, appointed by the RKI for periods of three years. The members of this advisory forum are renowned experts in the fields of microbiology, virology, hygiene, epidemiology and public health. Occasionally, other national and international professional societies and experts are consulted to achieve a solid appraisal of the candidate laboratories.",

A strict prioritization process, based upon necessity and not upon offer, was implemented. The evaluation process became more rigorous. Essential evaluation criteria are public health needs and public health relevance, successful network activities, attestable quality assurance, publications as well as a positive appraisal of the advancement of diagnostic procedures. At the end of each appointment period, an evaluation of the laboratories is performed by the RKI in cooperation with the Advisory Board for Public Health Microbiology, which again consults national and international professional societies and experts. Based on the evaluation results, the president of the RKI, in cooperation with the Federal Ministry of Health, appoints and reappoints the NRCs and CLs. The 2013 evaluation of the CLs resulted in the reappointment of 40 CLs and the shutdown of nine CLs. Reasons for closing were, for example, the retirement of the laboratory head (appointments are based on the combination of personal and institutional expertise), decreased public health relevance of the pathogen or an overlapping of the functional areas of responsibility with other CLs or NRCs. In the 2013 evaluation of the NRCs, all 19 NRCs were reappointed.",

The decision on the level of funding of individual NRCs is made by the RKI, based on criteria such as high consultation effort, high sample appearance and extraordinary public health relevance of the pathogen. In contrast to the NRCs, which have always been financially supported, the CLs initially performed their work (mainly consultation) without any financial support. From April to December 2009, the CLs received basic funding of D5000 per year (total amount in 2009: D2173,000). In 2010, the available funding increased to D2612,000. The increase in funding was used to upgrade the CLs' basic funding to around D10,000 per year. Beyond that, the funds had to cover new national networks. In 2014, the 19 NRCs received between D60,000 and D253,000 per year. Thirty-three of the CLs get D10,200, and seven CLs with a high number of samples and extraordinary public health relevance of the pathogen received D16,000 per year. The network projects were funded with approximately D380,000 in 2014. The NRCs have a more comprehensive work package than the CLs and therefore the NRC receive a higher funding. Public funding does not and cannot cover the total costs of the reference laboratories. Since 2010, the sphere of action and the workload of the laboratories have increased due to advancement of methods. At the same time costs in general have increased, but the grant total has remained unchanged. Currently, funding increases for individual laboratories can occur only through money shifting from one laboratory to another or through giving up funding for existing NRCs or CLs. In order to maintain the current quality and scope an increase in funding for NRCs and CLs is urgently needed.",

Ten NRC networks were launched at a work conference of the standing working group of NRCs and CLs (\"St\u00e4ndige Arbeitsgruppe NRZ/KL\") in Stuttgart in 2009. These networks covered the following topics: respiratory tract infections; enteral infections; infections in patients with immune deficiency or pregnancy; invasive bacterial infections; zoonoses; mycoses; sexual and blood transmitted infections; infections of the nervous system; antimicrobial resistance; and parasitoses, tropical and vector-borne infections. The aim of these networks was to facilitate the exchange of diagnostic methods among the NRCs and CLs, to improve collaboration in planning and performing studies and to enlarge the geographic coverage of these services. Furthermore, these networks should provide opportunities to work on issues beyond single pathogens.",

The everyday work of local public health agencies depends on the professional expertise of national reference centers (NRCs) and consultant laboratories (CLs). Meanwhile, the public often sees the relevance of public health microbiology only within the context of serious health events. During periods of restricted financial resources, the need for public health infrastructures is consistently questioned. The large EHEC O104 outbreak in Hamburg during 2011 provides an example of the importance of public health laboratory infrastructures (Frank et al., 2011) . During the Hamburg outbreak caused by fenugreek sprouts, the German public health system successfully investigated and controlled the outbreak, which would not have been possible without support from the NRC for enteral infections and the CL for hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This support would not have been possible without these highly specialized laboratory structures. The work of all other NRCs and CLs is also highly relevant, since their work and expertise help in the efforts to contain and prevent higher levels of infectious disease. Nevertheless, there is also room for improvement in Germany. For example, the anticipating of new outbreak situations that might require cooperation with the responsible veterinarian and food authorities or with other national authorities should be the focus of optimization plans. The creation of a prospective network of EU-wide public health microbiology reference laboratories is currently being discussed within the European Union, which will have consequences for the public health laboratory systems of each member state. From this perspective, considerable future challenges to the German public health laboratory system can already be foreseen. Thus, the structures established during the past 20 years should be adaptable so that the responding public health infrastructures can react adequately to the upcoming challenges.",
