Since the late 1990s, several PEDV vaccines have been commercialized in Asian countries as part of a comprehensive approach to disease prevention, because the clinical impact of PEDV is more acute and severe in Asia than in Europe [6] . Although the use of commercial vaccines may have led to a decline in the prevalence of the disease, the vaccines do not induce complete protection against the current epidemic PEDV strains in newborn piglets [7] .",

Among the structural proteins, the S protein is a type I glycoprotein present on the surface of virions that plays an important role in virus attachment to cell receptors, and it is a target for induction of neutralizing antibodies, as it harbors virus-neutralizing epitopes [10] [11] [12] . In addition, the S protein is associated with adaptation of viruses to growth in cell culture and attenuation of PEDV virulence in the natural host [13] . Therefore, the S protein of PEDV has been the subject of sequence diversity investigations aiming to understand the genetic and phylogenetic relationships of PEDV isolates and the epidemic status of PEDV in the field.",

Viral shedding in feces was determined using a commercial rRT-PCR kit. All pigs in the non-vaccinated control (NVC) group exhibited early signs of disease, typically mild diarrhea and loss of appetite (mean clinical score \u22641.0) after 2 dpc and experienced severe watery diarrhea with vomiting thereafter (mean clinical score \u22641.75) (Fig. 2A) . The IMS1313-and IMSgel-adjuvanted vaccine groups exhibited a similar clinical presentation to that of the NVC group. In contrast, the ISA206-adjuvanted vaccine group exhibited weaker and delayed clinical signs, mainly mild diarrhea (mean clinical score \u22641.0). In the ISA201 vaccine group, clinical disease progression was slow, and clinical severity was relatively weak, compared with the NVC group, but watery diarrhea eventually developed. Viral shedding was defined as the presence of PEDV RNA as detected by rRT-PCR. PEDV shedding in feces in all groups was generally accompanied by clinical signs of disease (Fig.  2B) . PEDV RNA was first detected in one of four pigs in the IMS1313, IMSgel, and NVC groups at 3 dpc. The duration of viral shedding differed among the groups. In the ISA206 and ISA201 groups, viral shedding in feces continued for 3 and 6 days, respectively. In contrast, in the other vaccinated groups and in the NVC group, viral shedding in feces was observed until the end of the challenge experiment.

This indicated that the virus had acquired adaptive mutations that enhanced production of infectious virus. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the whole genome of QIAP1401-p70 by next-generation sequencing. Compared with reference G2b genogroup PEDVs, the adapted QIAP1401-p70 genome harbored mutations in genes encoding structural and nonstructural proteins. Among these mutations, the most remarkable was a 25 aa deletion in the ORF1a region of the nonstructural protein. We hypothesized that this 25 aa deletion reduced the duration of the replication cycle of QIAP1401-p70. This finding is supported by previous reports that the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the coronavirus genome contains ORF1a and ORF 1b, which encode the viral RNA replicase [24, 25] .",

The strongest antibody responses were detected in pigs that received the vaccines containing oil-based W/O/W emulsion adjuvants, and the ISA206-based vaccine protected against both disease progression and viral shedding.

According to the manufacturer, both adjuvants significantly enhance the strength and duration of the immune response and are suitable for a wide range of infectious agents. Indeed, the ability of both adjuvants to induce specific mucosal immunity against various pathogens in target animals has been assessed [33] [34] [35] . In this study, pigs that received the vaccines containing IMS1313 and IMSgel exhibited a strong serum PEDV-specific antibody response. In summary, a novel inactivated PEDV vaccine formulated with a W/O/W emulsion adjuvant was immunogenic and effective in growing pigs. Our findings support use of growing pigs as an alternative experimental model for assessment of the protective efficacy of inactivated PEDV vaccines in pregnant sows and neonatal piglets. Therefore, our results may be used to reduce the risk of failure in future clinical trials of PEDV vaccines. Maternally derived lactogenic immunity (IgG and IgA) plays an important role in protection of neonatal piglets against PEDV infection [20] . Thus, future studies should assess the effect of vaccinating sows with our novel inactivated PEDV vaccine on neonatal piglets.",
