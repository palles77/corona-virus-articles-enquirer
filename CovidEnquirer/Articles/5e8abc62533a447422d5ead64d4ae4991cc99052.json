            "text": "Natural compounds are becoming popular for the treatment of illnesses and health promotion, but the mechanisms of action and safety profiles are often unknown. Xyloketal B (XKB) is a novel marine compound isolated from the mangrove fungus Xylaria sp., with potent antioxidative, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective effects. However, its molecular targets and effects on drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the potential molecular targets of XKB using bioinformatic approaches and to examine the effect of XKB on the expression and activity of rat cytochrome P450 3a (Cyp3a) subfamily members using midazolam as a model probe. DDI-CPI, a server that can predict drug-drug interactions via the chemical-protein interactome, was employed to predict the targets of XKB, and the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was used to analyze the pathways of the predicted targets of XKB. Homology modeling was performed using the Discovery Studio program 3.1. The activity and expression of rat hepatic Cyp3a were examined after the rats were treated with XKB at 7 and 14 mg/kg for 8 consecutive days. Rat plasma concentrations of midazolam and its metabolite 1\u2032-OH-midazolam were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Bioinformatic analysis showed that there were over 324 functional proteins and 61 related signaling pathways that were potentially regulated by XKB. A molecular docking study showed that XKB bound to the active site of human cytochrome P450 3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology model via the formation of hydrogen bonds. The in vivo study showed that oral administration of XKB at 14 mg/kg to rats for 8 days significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of midazolam, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma clearance and AUC ratio of 1\u2032-OH-midazolam over midazolam. Further, oral administration of 14 mg/kg XKB for 8 days markedly reduced the activity and expression of hepatic Cyp3a in rats. Taken together, the results show that XKB could regulate networks of molecular proteins and related signaling pathways and that XKB downregulated hepatic Cyp3a in rats. XKB might cause drug interactions through modulation of the activity and expression of Cyp3a members. More studies are warranted to confirm the mechanisms of action of XKB and to investigate the underlying mechanism for the regulating effect of XKB on Cyp3a subfamily members.

In particular, there is a lack of data on molecular targets, mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics (PKs, mainly focused on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion [ADME]), and toxicology for most natural products. 2,3 On the other hand, many of the natural products have the ability to regulate important drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, such as the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) and P-glycoprotein. This has raised a safety concern regarding the use of natural products due to their modulatory effect on the activity and expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters, resulting in potentially harmful drug interactions and eventually adverse drug reactions. 4 Human CYPs are a superfamily consisting of 57 functional genes that oxidize over 95% of the drugs in clinical use. 5,6 The human CYP3A subfamily contains four members, with CYP3A4 being the most abundant enzyme in the liver and intestine. 5 Importantly, CYP3A4/5 is predisposed to induction and inhibition when exposed to a number of endogenous and exogenous factors, probably resulting in an altered PK profile of the victim drug and adverse drug reactions, in particular, for those drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such as digoxin, warfarin, and carboplatin. 7,8 The rat Cyp3a subfamily contains Cyp3a1, 3a2, 3a9, and 3a62.",

About 17.3 million people died from CVD in 2008, accounting for 30% of all global deaths. 11, 12 Of these, about 7.3 million deaths resulted from coronary heart disease and 6.2 million deaths were due to stroke. 11,12 The incidence of CVD is increasing, exposing individuals, family, and society to a great burden. The pathogenesis of CVD is complicated, and oxidative stress has been proposed to be a causal factor in the pathogenesis. 13,14 Reducing oxidative stress has been reported to be a promising strategy for the treatment of CVD. 13 A number of natural products show potent antioxidative effects, and coadministration of natural products with cardiovascular drugs has gained increasing popularity because of these effects, although there is a lack of systematic preclinical and clinical data on their PKs, molecular targets, mechanisms of action, and toxicology. 15, 16 Marine organisms are an attractive source for drug development.

DAVID adds biological function annotation including gene ontology, pathway, proteinprotein interactions, functional groups of genes (ie, clustering), and disease associations derived from main public data sources. The genes of interest were visualized using BioCarta and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway maps. The highest classification stringency was selected for functional annotation clustering. Enrichment scores and Fisher's Exact test P-values (and the corresponding false discovery rate) were then calculated to identify which functional-related gene groups are significantly enriched in the target list. These significant enriched gene groups could provide clues on how XKB interacts with molecular targets in a systematic way.

To establish the dose-response and dose-toxicity relationships of XKB, we investigated its metabolism and PKs in rats. In vivo, the plasma PKs of XKB followed a two-compartment model with a distribution phase and an elimination phase. 22 XKB showed a short elimination half-life (22-27 minutes) , suggesting that it was rapidly distributed in the body and also rapidly eliminated. However, the molecular targets in response to XKB treatment and the effect of XKB on regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes are unknown.",

For preparation of XKB, the two-dimensional structure of the XKB was downloaded from PubChem. The hydrogen and Gasteiger charge were added and the file format was transformed into mol2 using Vega ZZ. The docking program AutoDock 4.2 was used to dock the XKB molecule into all 353 pockets, generating a score vector of 353 dimensions.

The membranes were then washed with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 buffer and incubated with secondary antibody for one hour at 37\u00b0C. Signals were detected using the Clarity Western ECL substrate and Bio-Rad imaging system. Quantification was performed using the ImageJ Analyzer 4.0 software Media (Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA).

Association of the TCR with a peptide antigen-bound MHC complex facilitates the interaction of CD4 and CD8 with MHC class II and class I molecules, respectively, and thereby recruits the associated LCK to the vicinity of the TCR/CD3 complex. LCK then phosphorylates tyrosine residues within the immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of the TCR-\u03b3 chains and CD3 subunits, initiating the TCR/CD3 signaling pathway. In addition, it contributes to signaling by other receptor molecules. It associates directly with the cytoplasmic tail of CD2, and upon engagement of the CD2 molecule, LCK undergoes hyperphosphorylation and activation. It also plays a role in the IL2 receptor-linked signaling pathway that controls the T-cell proliferative response. Binding of IL-2 to its receptor results in increased activity of LCK.

Both midazolam and ketoconazole bound to the active site of human CYP3A4 via \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking with Phe108 ( Figure 2B ) and Arg105 (Figure 2C ), respectively. However, probucol did not show hydrogen bond formation, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, or charge interaction with human CYP3A4 ( Figure 2D ). Further, we built a homology model of rat Cyp3a2 based on the crystal structure of human CYP3A4 (PDB ID 4K9W). The sequence similarity and identity between the human CYP3A4 and rat Cyp3a2 homology model was 83.3% and 68.4%, respectively. The CDOCKER interaction energy ranged from 23 to 34 kcal/mol ( Table 5 ). The docking results showed that XKB bound to the active site of rat Cyp3a2 homology model by hydrogen bond formation with Ala482 ( Figure 3A) . Midazolam was readily docked into the active site of the rat Cyp3a2 homology model by \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking with Phe305 ( Figure 3B ). Ketoconazole bound with Arg105 by hydrogen bond formation at the active site of the rat Cyp3a2 homology model ( Figure 3C ).

In the present study, we predicted over 324 molecular targets and 61 related signaling pathways regulated by XKB. We found that XKB interacted with the rat hepatic Cyp3a2 homology model via hydrogen bond formation. Further, we found that XKB increased the AUC 0-t and C max of midazolam, and inhibited the activity and expression level of Cyp3a in rats treated with XKB for 8 days. Our findings indicate that the beneficial effects of XKB can be attributed to regulation of a network of molecular targets and signaling pathways and that XKB can regulate Cyp3a-mediated drug metabolism by suppressing the activity and expression of Cyp3a in vivo. Bioinformatic approaches have become a valuable way of predicting the interactome of a chemical molecule, so we used a DDI-CPI tool to predict the potential targets and employed DAVID to analyze the molecular targets and related signaling pathways regulated by XKB. Our findings show that XKB can modulate a number of functional proteins and related signaling pathways. These proteins and signaling pathways have important roles in the regulation of redox homeostasis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, energy metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and the inflammatory response. Interestingly, XKB shared a number of molecular targets with probucol, which was initially developed as an antihyperlipidemic drug for the treatment of coronary artery diseases but was removed from the USA market in 1995 after it was found to prolong the QT interval. 33, 43 The overlapped molecular targets suggest that XKB can regulate the same targets and signaling pathways as probucol. Probucol has been reported to lower cholesterol levels in the blood by increasing the rate of low-density lipoprotein catabolism, inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, and delaying cholesterol absorption. 44 It is also a potent antioxidant that suppresses the oxidation of cholesterol in low-density lipoproteins. The cholesterol efflux regulatory protein ABCA1 is considered its main target. 45 As a natural marine compound, XKB may be a promising agent for the treatment of CVD when its potential cardiovascular side effects can be minimized or avoided.

The rat Cyp3a2 homology model was built based on human CYP3A4 (PDB ID 4K9W). Our data show that the rat Cyp3a2 homology model shared 83.3% sequence similarity and 68.4% identity with human CYP3A4. It has been reported that rat Cyp3a2 exhibits a 73% homology amino acid sequence to human CYP3A4. 48 This difference may affect the interaction between XKB and rat Cyp3a2. Indeed, our findings show that XKB interacted with the rat Cyp3a2 homology model via hydrogen bond formation at Ala482 located in the active site of the enzyme. However, there was no interaction between XKB and human CYP3A4 Ala482 located in the active site, but Gly481. Collectively, our modeling study shows that XKB can act as a substrate and/or inhibitor for both rat Cyp3a2 and human CYP3A4.

It has been widely used to examine the degree of drug interaction and inhibitory effect of xenobiotics on the activity and function of CYP3A4/5 via evaluation of urinary and/or plasma levels of midazolam and its main metabolite 1\u2032-OH-MDZ. 49, 50 In our study, plasma concentrations of midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ were determined using a validated HPLC method with a high specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and recovery rate for midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ, and the tested samples showed high stability. This indicates that the HPLC method is reliable for determining the plasma concentration of midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ. Our present findings show that oral administration of XKB 14 kg/mg for 8 days significantly elevated the AUC 0-t and C max of midazolam, but decreased its CL/F. XKB also showed an inhibitory effect on the metabolism of midazolam similar to that seen with ketoconazole in vivo. However, there were not remarkable changes in the k a , k e , t 1/2ka , t 1/2ke , and V/F of midazolam and 1\u2032-OH-MDZ in rats treated with XKB. Collectively, the data strongly suggest that XKB decreased Cyp3a-mediated metabolism and clearance of midazolam in rats. Notably, it has been reported that midazolam has inducing effects on expression of Cyp3a1 and Cyp2b in rat hepatocytes, 51 which in turn may affect its own metabolism and that of other Cyp3a substrate drugs. Further, we found that oral administration of XKB for 8 days significantly reduced the expression and activity of hepatic Cyp3a via unknown mechanisms, but probably due Effect of oral administration of XKB on hepatic Cyp3a activity in rat liver microsomes.

The potential interactions between XKB and CYP3A4/Cyp3a2 may lead to unfavorable drug interactions. In addition, the short elimination half-life of XKB may negatively affect its concentration at the site of action and compromise the therapeutic effect in clinical practice. Therefore, these findings provide clues for further XKB-based drug development and clinical use, including structural modification or nanotechnology-based formulations to minimize or avoid its potential side effects and prolong its elimination half-life to achieve therapeutic concentrations at the site of action.",

It has been reported that protein degradation is an important regulator of CYP turnover at the post-translational level. 52 In our study, we predicted that XKB might target ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 7 and 14 (USP7 and USP14), which play important roles in protein degradation. XKB might regulate ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation to downregulate the content of rat hepatic Cyp3a2. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms cannot be excluded. For example, microRNAs are the major determinants of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, suppressing gene expression by mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. 53, 54 Moreover, it has been reported that the expression of rat hepatic Cyp3a2 is predisposed to regulation by nuclear transcription factors or nuclear receptors, [55] [56] [57] which may also be involved in the regulatory effect of XKB on expression of rat Cyp3a2.These data have important implications in drug development when XKB is used as a lead compound. For example, XKB may have profound therapeutic effects due to interactions with its potential multiple targets; however, a multitargeted agent may also result in side effects due to unwanted binding ",
