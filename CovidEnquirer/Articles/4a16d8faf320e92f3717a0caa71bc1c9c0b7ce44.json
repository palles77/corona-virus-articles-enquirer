The FIPV DF-2 strain was kindly provided by Berndt Klingeborn (SVA, Uppsala, Sweden). The whole genome of FIPV DF-2 was cloned into the pBeloBAC 11 lowcopy vector that allows efficient intracellular production of the viral RNA from the cDNA by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter in order to gain the recombinant FCoV PBFIV-DF-2 (GenBank accession number: JQ408981.1). The originally truncated ORF3abc of this virus was replaced with the intact ORF3abc of a type I ''FCoV-like'' canine coronavirus (CCoV) reference strain Elmo/02 to construct PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i (GenBank accession number: JQ408980.1) (B\u00e1 lint et al., 2012).",

            "text": "SPF Domestic Shorthair IQHsdCpb kittens (Isoquimen SL, Barcelona, Spain) and conventional British Shorthair cats from a FCoV negative Hungarian cattery (regularly monitored for two generations) were used in the challenge experiments. The non-SPF cats were originated from three non-related queens and two toms. Kittens arrived at the facility at the age of 8-12 weeks. They were acclimated and used in the studies at the age of 14-18 weeks. The animals were kept in separate groups in a closed facility. Their FCoV negative status was checked with PCR and virus neutralisation tests. The absence of feline parvovirus (FPV), feline herpesvirus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FELV) in the conventional cats was confirmed by PCR and/or ELISA tests. For study purposes, the same group structure was established both for SPF and conventional kittens such as two study groups (Group 1 and Group 2, each n = 5) and a control group (C-Group, n = 2) were formed. Kittens were inoculated oronasally (D0 and D14) and intramuscularly (D28 and D42) with 10 3 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID 50 ) of the recombinant viruses PFIPV-DF-2 (Group 1) and PFIPV-FD-2-R3i (Group 2), respectively. The vaccinated animals and unvaccinated controls were oronasally challenged (D56) with 10 3 TCID 50 of the parent virus FIPV DF-2. The whole clinical observation period of time was altogether 8 months long. During this time kittens were clinically examined on a daily basis. Cats were scored for several clinical signs as described earlier (Haijema et al., 2004) . Briefly, scoring was based on depression (inactivity for three consecutive days, 1 point), anorexia (not eating for three consecutive days, 1 point), and neurological disorders (swaggering, 1 point) on a daily basis, while fever (40.1 8C, 1 point), jaundice (yellow plasma, 1 point), weight loss (loss of 2.5% of body weight per week, 1 point), and lymphopenia (lymphocyte count of <0.5 \u00c2 10 9 /l) was scored on weekly basis. Kittens showing signs of terminal FIP were euthanized in order to avoid unnecessary suffering, while healthy animals were exterminated at day 90 post-challenge (p.c.), followed by full post-mortem examination. All animal experiments were approved and supervised by the Ethical and Animal Welfare Committee of the National Food Chain Safety Office.",

The immunological aspects of FIP are complex and have not been fully elucidated yet. FIPV could negatively influence immune system intervening at several points. This virus variant is a highly virulent monocyte/macrophage pathogen causing systemic immune complex mediated infection (Vennema et al., 1998; Takano et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2010) .

In most of the cases the challenge led to ADE and in all case to the development of severe symptoms of FIP in non-SPF animals, independently of the genetic characteristics of the applied vaccine candidates. ADE pathomechanism is not an exclusive feature of FIPV infection; it resembles to the ADE-based Dengue haemorrhagic shock syndrome, first described by Peiris and Porterfield (1979) . The same phenomenon was also observed in the case of flaviviruses, alphaviruses, lentiviruses, influenzaviruses, enteroviruses and measles virus (Peiris and Porterfield, 1979; Porterfield, 1986; Takeda et al., 1988; Tamura et al., 1991; Chen et al., 2013; Iankov et al., 2013) . It is suspected that ADE might be more severe by early FIPV challenge after vaccination. However, the lack of development of fatal FIP and ADE among SPF cats and the prolonged survival of two non-SPF animals after 14 days challenge suggest that other biological factors could have as strong effect on the development of FIP as early challenge.",

Studies conducted by others are congruent with ours and indicate that virtually all cats develop FIP within four weeks after FIPV DF-2 challenge (reviewed in Pedersen, 2009 ). This is the first case when we observed long-term survival in our vaccination trials. It may be the consequence either of the slightly higher neutralising antibody titre of the two animals or it can be the result of the altered specificity of their immune response.
