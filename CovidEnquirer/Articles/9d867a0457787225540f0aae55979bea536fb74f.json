Fecal samples from 2% of these patients are collected and examined as part of systematic routine surveillance system for the presence of enteric pathogens (11) . All procedures were performed in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Stool specimens from a subset of patients from routine surveillance during 2007-2009 (1,614 samples total) were available for further studies. These specimens were prescreened for adenovirus and rotavirus A by using Taq-Man EZ RT-PCR Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), rotavirus primers RVNSP3R and RVNSP3F and probe 5\u2032-FAM-AGTTAAAAGCTAA-CACTGTCAAA-TAMRA-3\u2032 (12) , and TaqMan Universal Mastermix (Applied Biosystems) (13) . Sequence-independent nucleic acid amplifi cation and next-generation sequencing were performed on 105 stool specimens from diarrhea patients enrolled during 2007 by using a 454 GS Junior Instrument (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) as described (6,7). More than 725,000 trimmed reads were assembled by using de novo assembly and analyzed according to BLAST searches (online Technical Appendix Figure 1 and Table 1 , wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/pdfs/12-0344-Techapp.pdf) (6,7). Sequences were classifi ed on the basis of the taxonomic origin of the best-hit sequence (6,7). An E (expect) value of 0.001 was used as cutoff value of signifi cant virus hits. The largest proportion of virus-related sequences in human diarrhea samples from Bangladesh in 2007 was related to known bacteriophages and mammalian viruses (online Technical Appendix Figure 1 ).",

Clinical data indicate that all patients with a recovirus present in their feces had 6 to >21 watery stools in the fi rst 24 hours after illness onset ( Table 2 ); 4 patients experienced vomiting and 2 patients had fever. Patient ages ranged from 3 months to 50 years. Three recovirus-positive patients showed evidence of coinfection with other pathogens that are known to cause di-arrhea in humans, such as rotavirus A, adenovirus, Vibrio cholerae, or Salmonella spp.; the other 3 patients did not. Although viruses such as norovirus, sapovirus, and astrovirus were not detected in the recovirus-positive samples by sequence-independent amplifi cation assays, all samples were not analyzed for all known enteric pathogens. Of 514 diarrhea samples gathered by the Diagnostic Unit, Department of Virology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for diagnosis of gastrointestinal infections during 2007 and 2009, none was positive for Recovirus Bangladesh (data not shown).",

Bangladesh/289/2007 may also be considered a new genogroup of the genus Recovirus for the following reasons: 1) the genetic distance between Recovirus Tulane and Bangladesh/289/2007 VP1 is similar to that of VP1 capsids of noroviruses belonging to different genogroups (14); 2) the genetic distances between macaque recoviruses and Recovirus Bangladesh/289/2007 RdRP are similar to that of RdRP sequences of recoviruses belonging to different genogroups (15); 3) the genome organization of Recovirus Tulane and Bangladesh/289/2007 differs; and 4) Recovirus Tulane and Bangladesh/289/2007 were identifi ed in different host species. Salmonella spp. *All patients had watery diarrhea. \u2020Number of events in 24 h before sample collection. \u2021The pathogens that were tested for were Shigella spp., Aeromonas spp., Vibrio cholerae, Campylobacter spp., and Salmonella spp. In addition, the samples were screened for Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., Ascaris lumbricoides, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Isospora belli, adenoviruses, and group A rotaviruses. \u00a7The virus from patient 289 is the initially described calicivirus Bangladesh/289/2007 from this study. conclusion, this identifi cation of a novel calicivirus, classifi ed as Recovirus Bangladesh/289/2007, from human diarrhea samples provides PCR-based evidence that recoviruses can infect humans. A previous study found high prevalence of virus-neutralizing antibodies against a closely related calicivirus, Recovirus Tulane, in serum samples from animal caretakers",
