The condition of all patients was diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria and confirmed by seroconversion or a fourfold increase in antibody titer against SARS-CoV by means of immunofluorescent testing. The N protein-capture ELISA was performed (7). Briefly, 100 \u00b5L of serum was added to the wells of a microtiter plate coated with a mixture of three anti-N protein monoclonal antibodies, and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. After the plates were washed, 100 \u00b5L of anti-N rabbit antiserum was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. The wells were washed again and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with 100 \u00b5L of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig)G . After the plates were washed, 100 \u00b5L of tetramethylbenzidine solution was added to each well. The experiments involving the use of serum samples from patients with SARS were performed within the safety cabinet of a biosafety level 2 laboratory. The results for the 420 serum specimens tested by the N protein-capture ELISA are shown in Figure 1 . The N protein could be detected as early as day 1 and until day 18. In the 146 serum samples positive for N protein, the optical density (OD) value was highly variable from one sample to another on the same day. The sensitivity of detection was 94% (80 of 85 patients) with blood samples taken during the first 5 days and 78% (47 of 60 patients) for samples taken 6-10 days after onset of symptoms. The detection rate of N protein decreased to 27% on days 11-20 after onset of symptoms. Serum N protein was Figure 1 .

To establish the normal range of the N protein-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, serum specimens from 400 healthy blood donors were analyzed. The mean OD 450 for these specimens, as determined by the assay, was 0.078, with a standard deviation of 0.023. The cutoff OD 450 of the assay was then calculated as follows: cutoff = mean of OD 450 from 400 normal serum samples + 5 x standard deviations = 0.19. Solid line represents cutoff value. The result was considered positive if a sample yielded OD 450 above the cutoff. never detected beyond day 21. Using the same panel of the patient serum samples, we measured the N protein-specific IgG (SARS-CoV N-IgG) and SARS-CoV-specific IgG (SARS-CoV IgG) in serum samples by indirect ELISA, which progressively increased from day 7 onward (Figure 2 ). With the appearance of antibodies, the N protein detection rate decreased from day 10 after the onset of symptoms. However, from day 7 to day 18, a high level of N protein was still detectable in the serum samples from 11 patients with a mean of OD values of 1.65 when the SARS-CoV N-IgG had already increased to a level with a mean OD value of 1.18.",
