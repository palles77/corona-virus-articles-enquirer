To define the dynamics of the immune spectrum in SARS, serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulins, complement and specific antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and phenotypes of peripheral lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry in 95 SARS-infected patients. Results showed that interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming growth factor b (TGF-b) were continuously up-regulated during the entirety of SARS. Regulated on activation normally T cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) levels were decreased, while monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was elevated in acute patients. Immunoglobulins and complement were elevated during the first month of SARS. Both serum-positive rates and titers of specific IgM and IgG antibodies responding to SARS-CoV peaked at days 41-60 from the onset of SARS. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased significantly in acute-phase. CD3+CD8+CD45RO+ T lymphocytes were decreased by 36.78% in the convalescent patients. Conclusion: SARS-CoV seemed to elicit effective humoral immunity but inhibited cellular immunity, especially CD8+ memory T lymphocytes over time. Prolonged overproduction of IL-10 and TGF-b may play an important role in the disease.",

It is known that human coronaviruses usually infect the upper respiratory tract and cause the common cold [3] , whereas SARS-CoV infects the lower respiratory tract, leading to pulmonary destruction [4] . Although antibody induction and lymphopenic responses to SARS-CoV have been briefly described elsewhere [5] , the precise immune and inflammatory responses following SARS-CoV infection remain unclear. Moreover, the rapidly reported results by other authors deal merely with one or two aspects of anti-viral immunity, i.e. either antibody induction, changes in T lymphocytes or alteration of cytokines. The initial studies showed that not only lung but also immune cells were targets of SARS-CoV [4] . What then, is the overall immune spectrum of SARS: the profile of humoral and cellular immunity and their importance in SARS; whether cytokines and chemokines play a role in pathogenesis of SARS; the status of immune memory function of lymphocytes in SARS? It is particularly important to explore a full, informative description of the immune response and pathogenesis in SARS. This will greatly help us in understanding the pathogenic mechanisms, as well as improving patient management and developing a vaccine to completely control SARS epidemics.",

The complement system is an important component of innate immunity and major anti-viral effectors. Besides the soluble mediators mentioned above, lymphocytes, especially T and B lymphocytes, play a central role in specific anti-viral immunity for clearing the virus. We thus decided to define the immune response profile, focusing mainly on cytokine/ chemokine balance and lymphocyte subtypes to give an overview of the immune spectrum against SARS-CoV. Therefore, we characterized systemically the spectrum of immune and inflammatory responses in 95 SARS-infected healthcare workers. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV seem to elicit effective humoral immunity but inhibit cellular immunity. An imbalance of Th2 over Th1 immunity, i.e. prolonged overproduction of IL-10 and transforming growth factor b (TGF-b), may play an important role in the disease. These observations are hypothesized to create an imbalance in immune function that could be associated with SARS pathogenesis, through direct destruction of lymphocytes by SARS or indirectly through impairment of cellular immunity by SARS-induced humoral mediators.",

The 95 patients were enrolled in the study. All had a definite close-contact history with a person who was a suspect, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and serum creatinine levels were elevated significantly within 10-14 days from onset of SARS, as described previously [6] . Approximately 10% of the patients suffered from hypoxemia. There was a 3-7 days (3.6 \u00b1 1.5) latency period prior to the onset of symptoms. All 95 patients developed fever (temperature > 38 for more than 24 h), and 25 of them had rigor (Table 1) . About 30% of patients presented with dyspnea, pleurisy and myalgia. Over 80% of the patients reported a productive cough and malaise. Mild leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed at initial presentation in about 30% of the patients. Within 1 week of onset of SARS, significant leukopenia (decreased to 3.4 \u00d7 10 9 per l) and thrombocytopenia (decreased to 159.0 \u00d7 10 9 per l) were observed. ALT was present in most cases, which is similar to previous reports [7, 8] . Three patients were treated with mechanical ventilation. After empirical treatment with antiviral regimens, gamma globulin and/or corticosteroids, all of these patients survived to recover from all symptoms. Most * Plus-minus values are mean \u00b1 S.D. Normal ranges are as follows: for red blood cell count, 3.5 \u00d7 10 12 to 5.5 \u00d7 10 12 per l; for hemoglobin, 110-160 g/dl; for white blood cell count, 4 \u00d7 10 9 to 10 \u00d7 10 9 per l; for lymphocyte percentage, 20-40%; for platelet, 100 \u00d7 10 9 to 300 \u00d7 10 9 per l; for ALT, 5-40 U/l; for AST, 5-40 U/l; for creatinine, 44-133 \u00b5mol/l. of these patients have good prognoses, and no sequelae have been observed to date. Control subjects were 60 healthy adult volunteers (male = 13, 21.6%; female = 47, 78.4%) with mean age 29.5 years old, sampled in a time sequence similar to that of the study subjects. Informed consent was obtained from the patients. The institutional review board and research ethics board of each participating institution approved this study.",

This differs from the results of previous reports, which found a Th1 pattern response [10] [11] [12] . The reason for this difference is unknown. Interestingly, this Th2 pattern was not statistically correlated with administration of steroids, although steroids can inhibit cytokine production. Also, it could not be due to use of ribavirin, because ribavirin switch cytokine response from a Th2 pattern to a Th1 one [13] and there was no evidence of this observed in this study. Thus, the difference may be due to variations in the study population, genetic heterogeneity of the SARS-CoV strains and discrepancies in the applied analytic methods. Previous work has shown that cytoplasmic parasites can directly activate nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-jB) pathway [14] . And another recent report showed that the Fig. 2 . Percentages of CD3+ of total numbers of PBMCs, percentages of CD4+, CD8+ lymphocytes of total numbers of CD3+ T cells, and CD4/CD8 ratios in acute-phase SARS patients. Percentages of T lymphocytes did not change significantly in acute-phase (P all > 0.30, one-way ANOVA), whereas percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased significantly (*: vs. the control and convalescent groups, P all < 0.001, oneway ANOVA). Alteration in CD4+ T cell percentage correlated statistically with steroid use (correlation coefficient =-0.372, P < 0.001, Spearman's correlation analysis), whereas CD8+ T lymphocytes did not (correlation coefficient =-0.125, P = 0.401, Spearman's correlation analysis). (A, percentages of T lymphocytes in acute patients; B, percentages of CD4+ T lymphocytes in acute-phase patients; C, percentages of CD8+ T lymphocytes in acute-phase patients. *: P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). The data were collected under the conditions indicated in Section 2.5, Flow cytometry analisis. SARS E2-spike protein contains a superantigen domain (residues 690-1050) that mimics the T-cell receptor a-bV chain protein [15] . Moreover, the entry of SARS-CoV into lymphocytes has been well established [16] . Therefore, we postulate that cytoplasmic SARS-CoVs could possibly activate Th2 cytokine release. It is well-known that Th2 immune response inhibits cellular immunity but facilitates induction of humoral immunity to help clear persistent viral infections [17] . So, this Th2 immune response may benefit the elimination of persistent extracellular coronavirus particles.",

In this study, the decrease in CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells was definitely related to the administration of steroids. For this reason, the changes in these two subsets of T cells could not fully be explained by the use of cortisol. In addition, we also found significant elevation of IL-10 and TGF-b in patients at acute-phase. These two cytokines are potent downregulators of the cell-mediated immune response [32, 33] , and TGF-bwas shown to be involved in pulmonary fibrosis, which is common in SARS [33] . Thus, the overexpression of these two cytokines in this study strongly suggests that they are involved in mediating lymphocyte damage in SARS.",

But in SARS, CD45RO-positive T lymphocytes in circulation were decreased to 6-7% in acute-phase, as demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy [35] . This raised the concern about the effect of SARS-CoV infection on immune memory of the patients. To observe immune memory function in convalescent patients, we measured peripheral memory T cells. To our surprise, SARS patients also experienced selective damage of peripheral CD8+ memory lymphocytes, and this phenomenon was not statistically correlated with induction of glucocorticoid therapy, even though steroids can induce inhibition of memory T cell development [36, 37] . Moreover, not all of the lymphopenia can be ascribed to exogenous steroids [38] . Taken together, it may suggest that the dramatic reduction in CD8+ memory T cells is caused by other mechanisms. Considerable data have shown that maintenance of memory T cells is fundamentally regulated by cytokines, and Th2 dominance is associated with increased apoptosis of CD45RO+ memory T cells [20, 37] . Thus, we hypothesize that selective damage of cellular immunity, especially the unusual loss of CD8+ memory lymphocytes, is much more likely to result from the prolonged overexpression of IL-10 and TGF-b.",
