Current evidence strongly supports an immune-mediated basis for myelin breakdown, with an effector role proposed for TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in which lymphokine-activated macrophages mediate bystander demyelination. The present study examined the possibility that concomitant or later-appearing neuroantigen-specific autoimmune T cell responses, such as those demonstrated in chronic-relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (R-EAE), may contribute to the demyelinating process following TMEV infection. T cell responses against intact, purified major myelin proteins (myelin 10 basic protein (MBP) and proteohpid protein (PLP)), and against altered myelin constituents were readily demonstrable in SJL//J mice with R-EAE, but were not detectable in SJL//J mice with TMEV-induced demyehnating disease. TMEV-infected mice also did not display T cell responses against the peptide fragments of MBP(91-104) and PLP(139-151) recently shown to be encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice. In addition, induction of neuroantigen-specific tolerance to a heterogeneous mixture of CNS antigens, via the i.v. injection of syngeneic SJL//J splenocytes covalently coupled with mouse spinal cord homogenate, resulted in significant suppression of clinical and histologic signs of R-EAE and the accompanying MBPand PLP-specific DTH responses. In contrast, neuroantigen-specific tolerance failed to alter the development of clinical and histologic signs of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease or the accompanying virus-specific DTH and humoral immune responses. These findings demonstrate that TMEV-induced demyelinating disease can occur in the apparent absence of neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses. The relationship of the present results to the immunopathology of multiple sclerosis is discussed.",

            "text": "Following intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis viruses (TMEV), certain mouse strains develop a chronic, inflammatory demyelinating disease that begins 1-2 months post-infection (p.i.) (Lipton, 1975; Dal Canto and Lipton, 1976; Lehrich et al., 1976) . This pathologic process is related to persistent infection wherein low levels of virus can be recovered from the central nervous system (CNS) for virtually the lifetime of the mouse (Lipton, 1975; Lehrich et al., 1976; Lipton et al., 1984) . We have recently proposed a model (Clatch et al., 1986) wherein virus-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) within the CNS results in demyelination by a terminal nonspecific bystander response mediated by activated macrophages. This hypothesis is based on our recent studies showing that disease susceptibility correlated with the temporal development of chronic, high levels of TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted DTH responses, but not with virus-specific serum antibody or splenic T cell prohferative (Tprlf) responses, or with CNS virus titers (Clatch et al., 1985 (Clatch et al., , 1986 (Clatch et al., , 1987 . Our hypothesis would account for the characteristic mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates observed in areas of primary demyelination (Dal Canto and Lipton, 1976; Lehrich et al., 1976) and for the increased numbers of macrophages (in which TMEV appears to primarily persist) within the CNS (Dal Canto and Lipton, 1982; Rodriguez et al., 1983) . The hypothesis is also consistent with previous findings that susceptibility to TMEV-induced demyelinating disease is controlled by at least two unlinked genes, one of which maps to the MHC (Clatch et al., 1985 (Clatch et al., , 1987 Rodriguez and David, 1985; Rodriguez et al., 1986) and another of which is closely linked to the constant region genes encoding the fl-chain of the T cell receptor (Melvold et al., 1987) .",

Due to its histopathologic similarities with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a possible role for autoimmune neuroantigen-specific T cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses has been hypothesized in MS (Waksman, 1984) . One could also envision autoimmune mechanisms contributing to the demyelinating process following TMEV infection: (a) as a direct consequence of CNS virus infection; (b) secondary to TMEVspecific immune-mediated CNS damage; or (c) as a result of cross-reactivity between TMEV and CNS antigens (i.e., molecular mimicry).",

In the present study, examination of mice with TMEV-induced demyelinating disease failed to reveal T cell responses specific for the defined encephalitogenic peptides of either MBP (Kono et al., 1988) or PLP (Tuohy et al., 1989) , or against spinal cord homogenate fractions, containing a heterogeneous mixture of both myelin and nonmyelin-associated CNS antigens. In addition, induction of neuroantigen-specific immune tolerance in SJL/J mice via the i.v. injection of syngeneic splenocytes covalently coupled with a crude mouse spinal cord homogenate (MSCH-SP) (Kennedy et al., 1988) had no effect on the development of TMEV-specific CMI responses or the clinical and histologic signs of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease, but severely inhibited the induction of clinical and histologic R-EAE and accompanying neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses. These results demonstrate that chronic TMEV-induced demyelination occurs in the apparent absence of neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses.",

Similar results were seen in mice infected with TMEV 90 days previously. As controls, SJL/J mice immunized with 25 #g of PLP(139-151) (four per group) responded significantly to challenge with the homologous PLP peptide and intact PLP, but failed to respond to TMEV or to the MBP(91-104).

Homogenates prepared from the spinal cords of normal mice (Normal MSCH) or from the spinal cords of mice undergoing active R-EAE (EAE MSCH) or TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV MSCH) were tested. The latter two preparations were used in an attempt to determine if TMEV-infected mice would respond to neuroantigenic determinants which might have been modified or altered as a consequence of active immune-mediated demyelination. As seen in Fig. 2 , mice (three per group) infected with TMEV 60 days previously failed to respond by either DTH or Tprlf responses to challenge with MBP or any of the MSCH preparations (panel B).

In two separate experiments, a total of 44 SJL/J mice were injected with 7.5 \u00d7 107 sham-coupled spleen cells (Sham-SP) and 45 mice with 7.5 \u00d7 107 MSCH-SP on day -7. On days 0 and + 7, 25 mice from each treatment group were immunized with MSCH/ CFA and observed for development of clinical R-EAE for 60 days (Fig. 3A) . The remaining 19-20 mice from each treatment group were inoc-ulated i.c. with virus and observed for clinical signs of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease for 65 days (Fig. 3B ). In agreement with our recent results (Kennedy et al., 1988) , i.v. tolerization with MSCH-SP led to a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in clinical R-EAE (7/25 = 28% affected) compared to controls injected with Sham-SP (17/25 = 68% affected). Average clinical scores of affected mice in the Sham-SP-injected group were severe. Of 17 affected mice, one died, one recovered completely, and 15 remained chronically affected with six of those exhibiting clinical relapses. The average clinical scores in affected MSCH-SP-injected mice were generally less severe than in the shamtolerized controls, and 6/7 affected animals completely recovered after the initial clinical episode.

            "text": "In addition to virus-specific CMI, it is also possible that an autoimmune CMI effector component, such as that demonstrated in EAE, could contribute to the demyelinating process. Activation of neuroantigen-specific CMI responses could occur as a consequence of CNS viral infection via at least three mechanisms. First, viral replication could lead to altered neuroantigen metabolism with the subsequent release of native or altered CNS antigens either locally or into the periphery resulting in autosensitization. Within the CNS, this may be influenced by inappropriate presentation of self antigens by CNS astrocytes (Londei et al., 1984) which have been induced to express nonphysiologic levels of Ia antigens (Fontana et al., 1984) . Second, virus-specific immune-mediated damage may similarly lead to release of negative or altered CNS antigens and subsequent autosensitization. In support of these first two possibilities, sensitization to MBP has been shown to accompany two different CNS viral infections. Lymphocytes from rats with subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis induced by i.c. infection 19 with the coronavirus, JHM, have been stimulated to proliferate in vitro in response to MBP. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of these cells into normal recipients has led to mild clinical disease and CNS lesions resembling EAE (Watanabe et al., 1983) . Similarly, T cell lines specific for MBP, isolated from rats with subacute measles encephalomyelitis, transferred EAE-like symptoms to normal recipients (Liebert et al., 1988) . However, no apparent cross-reactivity between either the MBPspecific T cells or serum antibody with measles virus has been demonstrated. A third mechanism leading to autosensitization could occur if virusspecific immune responses cross-react with an antigenic determinant(s) normally expressed on CNS tissue (i.e., molecular mimicry) (Notkins et al., 1984; Oldstone and Notkins, 1986) . In support of molecular mimicry, approximately 4% of monoclonal anti-viral antibodies have been shown to cross-react with host determinants expressed on uninfected tissues (Srinivasappa et al., 1986) . Similarly, potential cross-reactive antigens capable of stimulating CMI responses have been identified by sequence homology with viral structural proteins. A synthetic peptide, the composition of which was based on an area of sequence homology between the hepatitis B virus polymerase and the encephalitogenic region of rabbit MBP, has been reported to induce a mild perivascular infiltration of the CNS reminiscent of EAE in rabbits. This peptide also induced humoral and CMI responses which cross-reacted with MBP (Fujinami and Oldstone, 1985) .",

            "text": "In contrast to the JHM and measles virus models, our previous studies have not supported a role for neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. Neither clinical nor histopathological signs of demyelination were transferred by serum or lymphoid cells from TMEV-infected donors to normal, non-TMEV-infected recipients suggesting a lack of neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses (Barbano and Dal Canto, 1984) . In addition, serum and lymphoid cells from TMEV-infected donors failed to injure myelinating isogeneic organotypic cultures in vitro (Barbano and Dal Canto, 1984) . As a more direct measure, neuroantigen-specific DTH and splenic Tprlf responses specific for the major myelin proteins, MBP and PLP, were not 20 detected in SJL/J mice at any time following i.c. inoculation with TMEV (Miller et al., 1987) . This included time points prior to the onset of clinical signs of disease (day 23 p.i.), shortly after the onset of disease (day 69 p.i.), and 8-12 weeks after the onset of disease (day 127 p.i.). In contrast, MBP-and PLP-specific DTH and Tprlf responses were readily demonstrable in SJL/J mice directly before the first appearance of clinical R-EAE (day 14 after immunization with MSCH/CFA) indicating that CM! responses against myelin components are readily detectable in mice with R-EAE (Kennedy et al., 1987; Miller et al., 1987) . In addition, peripheral immunization of SJL/J mice with either UV-inactivated TMEV or rat MBP emulsified in CFA failed to reveal cross-reactive CMI responses upon secondary stimulation of primed lymph node cells in vitro (Miller et al., 1987) . The lack of neuroantigen reactivity in TMEV-infected mice, as measured by functional CMI analyses, was supported by the absence of significant amino acid identity between the TMEV capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, or VP3) and MBP or PLP (Miller et al., 1987) . Thus these data were consistent with our hypothesis (Clatch et al., 1985 (Clatch et al., , 1986 ) that TMEV-specific CMI responses constitute the major effector mechanism of CNS demyelination following TMEV infection. Lack of reactivity to the major myelin proteins was confirmed in the present report and, in addition, present data ( Fig. 1) failed to demonstrate T cell responses specific for determinants on PLP (Tuohy et al., 1989) and MBP (Kono et al., 1988) which have recently been shown to be encephalitogenic in SJL/J mice. The failure of MBP(91-104) (VTPRTPPPSQGKGR) to elicit responses in TMEV-infected SJL/J mice is particularly relevant. The RTPPP pentapeptide sequence contained within this peptide corresponds to the only area of any sequence homology between mouse MBP and the TMEV polyprotein, mapping to the nonstructural 2B protein of TMEV (Miller et al., 1987) .",

Homogenates prepared from the spinal cords of normal mice and mice undergoing active R-EAE or TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (which might be expected to contain neuroantigenic determinants which had been modified or altered as a consequence of active immune-mediated demyelination) stimulated T cell responses in mice with R-EAE, but not in TMEV-infected mice (Fig.  2) .",

            "text": "The present results confirm our previous findings regarding the ability of MSCH-SP-induced tolerization of adult, immunocompetent mice to significantly suppress the development of R-EAE and the causal MBP-and PLP-specific DTH responses. In contrast, the data show that the neuroantigen-specific tolerance failed to affect development of clinical and histologic signs of de-myelinating disease and the accompanying virusspecific CMI and antibody responses induced by TMEV infection (Figs. 3, 4, and 5) . Thus, the present results confirm and extend the nonquantitative results of Lang et al. (1985) which showed that treatment of immunoincompetent neonatal SJL/J mice with MSCH in incomplete Freund's adjuvant failed to affect development of demyelinating lesions in the CNS following infection with the DA strain of TMEV. Since our tolerance regimen involved the use of a heterogeneous mixture of neuroantigens (i.e., MSCH), it is likely that T cell-mediated immune responses to neuroantigens of minor or undefined encephalitogenic potential were tolerized in addition to DTH responses to MBP and PLP. The probable lack of responses to minor neuroantigens in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease is supported by the observation that CMI responses to whole MSCH were demonstrable in mice with R-EAE, but not in TMEV-infected mice (Fig. 2) . It should be emphasized that the present results only address a lack of neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses in the early stages (days 45-90 p.i.) of TMEV-induced demyelination. We are currently determining whether the induction of neuroantigen-specific tolerance after the first appearance of clinical signs of demyelination has any effect on the chronic course of the disease. It would be interesting to apply the current methodology of neuroantigen-specific tolerance induction to determine if MBP-specific immune responses play a primary or secondary pathologic role in the subacute demyelination observed in rats infected with JHM (Watanabe et al., 1983) and measles (Liebert et al., 1988) viruses.",

The current results may be particularly applicable to MS where there is circumstantial evidence favoring a viral etiology (Nathanson and Miller, 1978; Kurtke and Hyllested, 1986) , and where there is a lack of convincing evidence that MS patients display elevated 21 humoral or CMI responses to major encephalitogenic neuroantigens such as MBP and PLP (Waksman, 1984; Waksman and Reynolds, 1984; Raine, 1985; Hafler et al., 1987) . Future studies on the TMEV-induced demyelinating disease model will examine whether induction of specific tolerance to TMEV antigens will prevent or alter the course of disease.",
