We investigated prognostic factors for an adverse outcome among children admitted to the H\u00f4 pital d'Enfants de Rabat, Morocco with World Health Organization-defined clinically severe pneumonia (CSP). Methods: Children aged 2-59 months admitted to the hospital and fulfilling the CSP definition were recruited into this 13-month prospective study. A poor prognosis was defined as death, a need for intensive care, or a Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) score !3. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to ascertain independent predictive factors for a poor prognosis. Results: Of the 689 children included in this analysis, 55 (8.0%) required intensive care and 28 died (4.0%). Five hundred and two (72.8%) children were classified as having a good prognosis and 187 (27.2%) as having a poor prognosis. A history of prematurity (odds ratio (OR) 2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-5.04), of fever (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.32-3.83), living in a house with smokers (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.18-2.72), impaired consciousness (OR 10.96, 95% CI 2.88-41.73), cyanosis (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.05-4.15), pallor (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.34-3.84), having rhonchi on auscultation (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.58-3.79), and human metapneumovirus infection (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.13-4.02) were all independent risk factors for an adverse outcome, whereas a history of asthma (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.84) was the only independent risk factor for a positive outcome. Conclusions: The early identification of factors associated with a poor prognosis could improve management strategies and the likelihood of survival of Moroccan children with severe pneumonia.",

Respiratory infections cause a variety of clinical syndromes, of which pneumonia -perhaps the most paradigmatic and severe of all -is the most commonly associated with an adverse outcome, causing over 90% of all deaths. 3 Pneumonia is typically caused by bacterial agents, with Streptococcus pneumoniae 4 and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) 5 being the two most frequent underlying aetiologies. Respiratory viruses are typically the causes of upper and lower respiratory infections with a more benign course, although their pathogenic potential can sometimes be comparable to that of bacteria or even worse; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common viruses involved in severe childhood disease. 6 Whatever the underlying cause, case-fatality rates among under-fives hospitalized with pneumonia are reported to be around 19%. 7 In the developing world, currently existing interventions to reduce pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality include the implementation of anti-pneumonia vaccines through the Expanded Programme on Immunization during infancy, 8 and the adequate diagnosis and prompt treatment of clinical cases with antibiotics, in accordance with the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) algorithms, 9 under the assumption that in such settings the majority of severe pneumonia cases are of bacterial origin.",

The early identification of risk factors for a poor outcome among pneumonia patients could help prioritize the management of those patients with an uncertain prognosis and perhaps increase their likelihood of surviving. Previous studies have described a series of factors including young age of the patient (or the patient's mother), malnutrition, anaemia, or the confirmation of grunting, cyanosis, or chest indrawing, among others, as harbingers of a negative outcome. [10] [11] [12] [13] Scarce and limited epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological data are available regarding paediatric respiratory tract infections in the Kingdom of Morocco, a middle-income country in north-western Africa, although the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to 26.5% of all deaths in children aged 1-59 months are secondary to pneumonia. 14 In this analysis, part of a wider surveillance project on the aetiology of paediatric respiratory infections, we aimed to describe factors associated with a poor outcome among hospitalized children under the age of five admitted to a Moroccan reference hospital with a diagnosis of WHO-defined severe pneumonia.",

The few available publications [23] [24] [25] [26] have patchily presented data on specific microorganisms or generic laboratory findings, but to our knowledge, this project has been the first to comprehensively describe the burden, aetiology, and clinical characterization of severe paediatric pneumonia in a tertiary referral Moroccan hospital. 20 In this setting, paediatric respiratory disease results in unacceptably high associated casefatality rates (28 deaths, giving a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 4.0%, which is towards the upper bound of what has previously been described for similar or even poorer settings, ranging from 0.8% to 4.8% 7, 27 ) and affects mostly infants. 7 About a quarter of the patients recruited into this study could be classified as having a poor prognosis, and 8% of these patients required intensive care. Importantly, the management of these patients seems to have been adequately matched to the severity of their symptoms, with a good availability of intensive care and a very high coverage of oxygen and antibiotics, including broad-spectrum ones. 20, 28 Nosocomial infections, which in other settings may be an important cause of in-hospital mortality, appear to have played a moderate role in this series, as only about 14.2% of the patients (4/28) had an admission duration longer than 10 days. In this analysis, we aimed to identify patient risk factors (socioeconomic, clinical, and laboratory) upon arrival that could guide the clinician's response and help tailor the scarce resources for improved patient management. Such factors, extensively described in the pneumonia literature [10] [11] [12] [13] 19, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] and currently being specifically investigated as part of the PERCH (aetiology of pneumonia) multisite case-control study, 35 may change according to the local or regional epidemiology of LRTI, warranting locally specific analyses. In this series, and similar to what other authors have already described, impaired consciousness, 10,13,33 cyanosis as a proxy of hypoxemia, [11] [12] [13] 19, 36 and pallor 13, 34, 37 were three clinical signs strongly and independently associated with a poor prognosis, together with the presence of rhonchi. Wheezing, normally associated with relatively benign LRTI (bronchitis and/or bronchiolitis), and usually considered less frequent in developing settings in comparison to rich countries, 38 was very common in our series (present in up to two-thirds of the patients) and highly associated with viral infections, 20 but carried a low associated CFR and risk of a poor outcome. Although wheezing was not included in the final multivariate model because of being part of the composite definition of the outcome (being part of the RISC score), we found that a history of asthma was the only protective factor against a negative outcome in our series. Young age (infants <12 months vs. older children) was also confirmed as a risk factor for a poor prognosis, as has been shown in other studies. 11, 19, 32, 33 This sets the rationale for extra care when facing young infants with a respiratory symptomatology, likely warranting a more conservative approach in terms of management.",

Similarly, under-nutrition, although not included in the final model because of being part of the outcome definition of the RISC score, was also found to be strongly associated with a higher likelihood of death, and was highly prevalent, affecting about a quarter of the recruited patients with a good outcome and almost half of those with a bad outcome. In recent years, Morocco has made important efforts to introduce programs for the prevention and management of childhood diseases, including the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, supplementation of iron and vitamin A, and the introduction of anti-pneumonia vaccines, all of which may have an impact on the incidence of new malnutrition cases. However, malnutrition prevalence rates remain high in Morocco, 25, 39 and unless adequately addressed, will continue to negatively affect the survival of patients with pneumonia.",

[10] [11] [12] [13] Indeed, parental education, lack of breastfeeding, vaccination status, unavailability of adequate medical care, comorbidities and co-infections, metabolic acidosis, and other laboratory findings (leukocytosis, abnormal biomarkers, etc.), although assessed for some or the majority of outpatients, could not be independently related to a poorer outcome, even though the study sample size was relatively large and the univariate association was evident. This does not limit the strength of our results, but, in our opinion, may express that in this setting their validity as prognostic markers appears less critical than in other settings. Our study suffers from further limitations, including the fact that it was conducted in an urban referral tertiary hospital with good accessibility to intensive care, a factor that may have influenced the outcome for some of these patients, thus underestimating the real impact that pneumonia may have in other less advantaged or more rural areas of the country.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the wide implementation of anti-pneumococcal and Hib vaccines and other known preventive measures will certainly result in a significant decrease in pneumonia-related morbidity and mortality globally. However, in regions where pneumonia remains a major cause of disease and death, the emphasis on early identification of risk factors known to be globally or locally associated with a poor outcome and the establishment of adequate case management strategies can make an enormous difference in the prognosis of these patients. In this respect, this study represents an important addition to the significant knowledge gaps related to paediatric pneumonia in Morocco, and more widely in the Maghreb area, and provides good evidence for new approaches to prevent and better manage this deadly disease.",
