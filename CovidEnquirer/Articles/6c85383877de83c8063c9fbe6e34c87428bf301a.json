            "text": "Of the parasitic protozoa (Table l) , coccidian parasites belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa can be the most significant in terms of morbidity and mortality, especially in intensively reared animals. Included in this group are memberrs of the genera Eimeria and Zsospora which cause 'coccidiosis' in livestock and companion animals respectively. Animals such as the pig, may be infected with species of both genera. These parasites are characteristically highly host-specific undergoing development within a single host species (Levine 1985) . Other protozoa may be less host specific and may be of particular concern where lack of host-specificity may lead to zoonotic transmission and infections in man. Under this category, the most important parasites are Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Toxoplasma. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are increasingly recognised as significant causes of intestinal disease in animals and (1993) suggest that Hasfocystis should be classified in its own subphylum within the phylum sarcomastigophora man (Taylor 1995) . Toxoplasma may cause a range of clinical signs but is perhaps of greatest significance as a cause of congenital infection and abortion in pregnant women (Dubey 1986a) . Coccidiosis in domestic animals has been extensively reviewed and the reader is therefore referred to several texts (Long 1990 , Shirley 1992 , Barta and Fernando 1993 . For the purposes of this review, the incidence and clinical effects of Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Toxoplasma will be discussed in detail, as will advances in methods of diagnosis. Reference will also be made to other protozoa, including Balantidium, Blastocystis, Entamoeba, Neospora, Pneumocystis and the microsporidia.",

            "text": "Infection in man and domesticated livestock, particularly calves, is usually associated with C parvum. Cryptosporidiosis is prevalent in young calves and appears to be age related. Seasonal peaks of disease have been reported to coincide with birth peaks in spring and autumn (Angus 1988) . Infection is predominantly seen in young calves less than three weeks old (Fayer and Ungar 1986 ). The first calves to be born often become infected without showing clinical signs. In these calves the parasite multiplies producing large numbers of oocysts in the faeces which contaminate the environment for calves that follow. Infection spreads rapidly, and later-born calves can become so heavily infected that clinical disease results. Symptoms of profuse watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain and dehydration may be followed by recovery and immunity to further clinical episodes. Disease is often associated with the pres-ence of other organisms, notably enterotoxogenic Escherichia co& Salmonella spp., Clostridium perfringens, rotavirus and coronavirus (Current and Blagburn 1990) , all of which may contribute to the neonatal diarrhoea complex (calf scours) although evidence suggests that C parvum is a primary pathogen in its own right (Angus 1988). Disease associated with C parvum has also been reported in neonates of sheep, goats and deer and in non-domesticated ruminants including antelope and orynx (Gregory 1990) . Symptoms in all species included diarrhoea, dehydration and death in a number of cases. In young calves infected with C parvum, pathological signs include inflammation and distension of the intestines with enlargement of the mediastinal lymph nodes. Histopathological changes occur mainly in the jejunum and ileum with parasitic stages seen on the surface of epithelial cells lining the jejunum, ileum and caedum and occasionally in severe infections, the colon and rectum (Fayer and Ungar 1986) .",

In infected birds, parasites are on epithelial cells of the cloaca and Bursa of Fabricius (the site of B cell maturation in the bird), and occasionally the caecae and trachea. Heavy infections produce epithelial hyperplasia and hypertrophy, particularly of the bursa, and the ensuing inflammatory exudate occasionally produces bursal casts. Cryptosporidium meleagridis is thought to be the species associated with gut-related infections in turkeys (~Goodwin et al 1988) . The avian cryptosporidia appear to have a high host specificity for birds.

In animals, the primary route of infection is likely to be the direct animal-to-animal faecal-oral route. Thus, in calves for example, overcrowding, stress of early weaning, transport and marketing, together with low levels of hygiene will increase the risk of clinical infections. In lambs, chilling due to adverse weather conditions in the neonatal period, intercurrent infections or nutritional or mineral deficiencies could exacerbate or increase the likelihood of disease. Infection in these cases is likely to occur through grooming, nuzzling, coprophagy, faecal soiling by direct contact with infected animals, or indirectly through consumption of contaminated foods or ~~viro~l~ental sources including pasture and water (Taylor 1995) . Reavy infections can lead to high levels of environmental contamination which influences the rate of infection in susceptible hosts.

Several strains have been used to differentiate oocysts from surrounding debris, including acid-fast stains, Giemsa, methenamine silver, period acid shift (PAS) and others. These methods, which are summarised in Table 2 , are generally considered to be adequate for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in samples from acute infections where many oocysts are present.

Electrophoretically distinct patterns of oocyst wall and sporozoite antigens have been constructed for C pawum, C mm-is and C baileyi (Nina et al 1992) . Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been produced which are specific to some of these polypeptides and such mAbs have the ability to distinguish sporozoites of C pawum, which is potentially the most pathogenic species to mammals, from other cryptosporidia. Monoclonal antibodies have become the basis for alternative detection methods which involve the use of immunofluorescence (IF) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Rusnak et al 1989) . Commercially available ELBA and IF kits, based upon genus specific mAbs to oocyst surface proteins have allowed the transfer of these techniques to diagnostic laboratories. Although, mAbs to genus-specific oocyst surface proteins are available, at present there are no mAbs that can be used to discriminate between species of intact oocysts. The detection limits of ELISAS and IF tests are similar to those stated above for the examination of stained faecal smears and depend primarily upon the concentration methods employed to prepare the sample (Weber et al 1991 , Webster et al 1998 .",

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an obvious choice for a sensitive and specific diagnostic test. When coupled with non-radioactive detection techniques which are now readily available, the transfer of sophisticated technology to the diagnostic laboratory becomes possible. The results of a number of PCRs have been published (for example Laxer et al 1991, Webster et al 1993) . They are based upon the amplification and subsequent detection of Cryptosporidium specific DNA. The latter authors introduced a differential probe which also allows discrimination between species. Currently only the first steps in diagnostic protocol development have been investigated. Before such techniques are adopted they require rigorous testing and comparison to orthodox methodologies. They do however, offer the advantage of increased sensitivity, with detection limits in the order of 80-90 oocysts per gram, when used in conjunction with immuno-magnetic separation (IMS) (Webster et al 1996) . Improved sensitivity, as offered by PCR, has implications for both epidemiological and clinical studies where the diagnosis of early or asymptomatic infection is important. It would assist the tracing of outbreaks, being applicable to the analysis of environmental samples and the identification of asymptomatic excretors and their potential role in the transmission of infection and disease.",

This assumption is not universally accepted, however, and current thought is that there are just three structural types or species (Thompson et al 1993) . The species affecting man and the majority of domesticated animals, is referred to as Giardia duodenalis although even here there are generic and specific variations with G intestinalis, G lamblia and Lamblia intestinalis being synonymous.

When disease does occur, the signs often include chronic, pasty diarrhoea, weight loss, lethargy and failure to thrive. The diarrhoea may be continuous or intermittent. The existence of Giardia in domestic animals has been known for many years but during that time little information has become available on prevalence, pathogenicity and the disease caused by these parasites in their hosts. Giardia has been reported in cattle, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rodents and psittacines. Based on limited investigations, the incidence of these parasites varies but can be assumed to be higher in some species than has been reported. Studies in Canada (Buret et al 1990) indicate infections in sheep and cattle of 18 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. Taylor et al (1993) reported that nearly 70 per cent of a flock of lambs were infected with Giardia although the presence of the organism was not necessarily associated with clinical signs of disease. Xiao et al (1993) reported a 100 per cent infection rate in young diarrhoeic calves on two farms. A survey of dogs attending a charity animal hospital in London (Sykes and Fox 1989) showed an overall prevalence of infection of 15 per cent with the highest prevalence in dogs less than 12 months of age (30 per cent). In aviary birds, Giardia is frequently encountered in psittacines such as cockatiels, budgerigars and lovebirds causing enteropathy, weight loss and death (Fudge and McEntee 1986).",

The parasite differs from other coccidia however, in that it shows a complete lack of specificity for hosts and tissues during its asexual phase and can infect a wide range of animals including man. The parasite has world-wide distribution and is of both medical and veterinary importance. In humans, toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic or associated with mild symptoms only, often characterised by lymphadenopathy involving the posterior cervical lymph nodes. In immunocompromised individuals (eg AIDS patients) T gondii infections can be severe with cerebral involvement (Johnson 1990). In pregnant women infection can result in miscarriage or congenital malformations of the child.",

As such beef is not generally regarded as an important source of human infection (Fayer 1981) . Milk from acutely infected animals has also been implicated as a source of infection (Reimann et al 1975) .

Detection of high antibody titres to T gondii at the time of abortion indicates a recent infection as a likely cause. However, since antibody titres may persist for months or even years, a firm diagnosis cannot be made on this basis only, especially in individual animals (Blewett et al 1983) . Recent studies by Dubey and colleagues (1995) have compared a number of serological methods for the detection of T gondii infection in naturally infected sows. The modified agglutination test (MAT) appeared to most useful test with a sensitivity and specificity of 82.9 per cent and 90.3 per cent respectively. This compared with 29.4 and 98.3 per cent for IHA; 45,9 and 96.9 per cent for LAT and 85.9 per cent for ELBA. Similarly an EL!SA, FAT and MAT were compared for the detection of antibodies to T gondii in ovine foetal fluids. Eighteen per cent of samples were positive by MAT compared with 15 per cent byELISA and 16 per cent by IFAT. The MAT was preferred because it is simple to perform and was more effective than IFAT for the detection of antibodies in autolysed foetuses (Seefeldt et al 1989) . Trees and colleagues (1988) also compared a LAT with the methods described above for the detection of antibodies to T gondii in ovine foetal fluids and found it he very specific (ie it never gave a positive reaction without at least one of the other methods also being positive). However, this group concluded that IFAT was the single most reliable method. Recently diagnostic methods based on detection of T gondii specific DNA by PCR have been developed. These have been based upon the p30 gene and can detect a single organism in the presence of a million host cells (Savva and Holliman 1990) . This PCR has also been applied to tissues from sheep (brain, amnion/chorion, peritoneal fluid and cotyledons) (Wheeler et al 1990). Other PCRs have been developed based upon sequences of ribosomal DNA (Guay et al 1993) and the El gene (Joss et al 1993) . Wastling et al (1993) compared the p30 and the Bl PCRs and found that the Bl PCR was more sensitive, gave fewer false-negatives and the results correlated closely with conventional mouse inoculation methods. The few false-positive results recorded are thought to be due to the presence of non-viable parasites.",

A similar parasite found in the central nervous system~of dogs in the USA in 1988, was named Neospora caninum (Dubey et al 1988,) . Prior to 1988, it is likely that N caninum -was misdiagnosed as T gondii because of their structural similarities (Dubey 1992). However, antigenic differences detectable by immunohistochemistry and serology, the thickness of the cyst wall, and the number of rhoptries in the tachyzoites enable these parasites to be distinguished at the generic levels (Dubey et al 1988b , Barr et al 1991a .",

Neosporosis is a major cause of abortion in dairy cattle;~ particularly in California, where since 1985 12-24 per cent of abortions have been due to N caninum (Anderson et al 1991; Barr et al 1991b) . Neospora caninum has been recorded in 1 l/120 Scottish cattle which had recently aborted, but only in l/9? cattle from herds in which there had been no recent abortions (Trees et al 1994) . In sheep, Otter and colleagues (1997b) examined foetal tissues using histopathology and foetal fluids using IFAT for antibodies to Neospora. Non-suppurative myocarditis and encephalitis were present in 0.3 per cent (9/281;) aborted lambs. Immunocytochemistry using antisera against Neospora and Sarcocystis resulted in no labelling, but anti-T gondii sera showed labelled organisms in four lambs. This suggests that neospora infection is not associated with significant numbers of ovine abortions in England and Wales. The complete life cycle of the parasite has yet to be elucidated. Only asexual stages of the life cycle (bradyzoites, tissue cysts and tachyzoites) have been described to date @peer and Dubey 1989). The only recorded method of transmission is transplacental (Dubey et al 1990b) although it is not inconceivable that transmission may occur via ingestion.",

Characteristic features may be identified using histology, but levels of infection are usually so low that detection of parasites in tissues may only be possible using immunohistochemical methods (Lindsay and Dubey 1989a) or by culture of the parasite in mice or tissue cultures (Lindsay and Dubey 1990 ). An indirect fluorescent assay (IFA) has been used to detect antibodies against trachyzoites in dogs (Dubey et al 1988'0). This has been modified with bovine serum and Neosporu tachyzoites from cattle (Barr et al 1993) . More recently, a number of ELISA tests have been developed for the serological diagnosis of Neospora infections in cattle. An ELBA described by Pare et al (1995) had a sensitivity and specificity of 88.6 per cent and 96.5 per cent respectively compared with immunohistochemical diagnosis. Bjorkman et al (1994) reported 97.6 per cent sensitivity and 95.6 per cent specificity, using IFAT as the standard. Williams and colleagues (1997) reported 96 per cent specificity and 95 per cent sensitivity respectively using an assay which has now been modified and is available commercially. Otter and colleagues (1995) reported non-suppurative inflammation of the brain and/or myocardium and placental cotyledons, identified by light microscopy in 10.5 per cent of aborted or stiIlborn foetuses from England and Wales. The diagnosis was confirmed by specific N caninum immunocytochemistry in 4.2 per cent of cases. Similarly McNamee and colleagues (1996) in Ireland found 6.3 per cent positive by histology and confirmed 4.2 per cent by immunocytochemistry. When maternal serology (FAT) was used to assess exposure to Neospora a prevalence of 12.6 per cent positives was found in aborting cows compared to 3 per cent in age matched normally calving controls. Otter et al (1997a) in a study of over 250 cows concluded that FATS on serum from aborting cows and on pleural fluid from aborted foetuses are useful diagnostic methods for Neospora but cautioned that preliminary investigations of abortions in a herd must include histological ~~arni~atioi~ of aborted foetuses. Marsh et al (1995) analysed the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (nss-rFwA) from five bovine Neospora spp. isolates, two N caninum isolates and three Toxoplasma gondii isolates to each other and to other sequences available on Cenbank (Sarcocystis).",

This has subsequently been confirmed by sequencing of the 16S-like region and the internal transcribed spacer 1 regions of the ribosomal RNA of canine and bovine isolates, which were identical (Stenlund et al 1997) . However, based on immunohistochemicaI staining, there may be antigenic differences between Neospovu parasites found in the tissues from naturally infected bovine foetuses and N caninum parasites in canine or murine tissues (Barr et al 1991a). Tissue cysts from an infected calf reacted positively to anti-N cat&urn sera, but unlike N caninum they were positive to two out of four sera to T gondii and to antisera from Hammondin hammondi. The authors suggested that the differences in antigenic reactivity may reflect variations of a single organism dependent on factors such as host species infected. However, this study remains to be confirmed. Four nucleotide differences were consistently detected when sequences of Neospora spp. isolates were compared with T gondii isolates (Marsh et al 1995) . These results indicate that Neospora and Toxoplasma are closely related but distinct species and provide the basis for sensitive differential PCR methods. Holmdahl and Mattsson (1996) described such a method which can specifically detect five organisms. Other protocols include those developed by Muller and colleagues (1996 ), Yamage et al (1996 ) Lally et al (1996 and Payne and Ellis (1996) . Such methods offer exquisite sensitivity, however, as yet PCR rem&w a tool for research.",

From there they may be carried via the portal system to the liver and other organs where large abscesses may form.

ELISA has been applied to the characterisation of the immune response to P carinii (Lundgren et al 1993) and also applied to survey birds in Denmark for the presence of P carinii (Settnes et al 1994) . Specific antibodies to a 116 kDa antigen of rat pneumocysts were demonstrated in 13 per cent of chicken sera examined. The presence of P carinii could not be demonstrated from lung tissue by TBO staining or PCR using the dihydrofolate reductase gene as a specific probe.

As medical practitioners become aware of microsporidia they are increasingly reported, and the incidence is now up to 27 per cent in AIDS patients (Sun 1993) . As new species of Microsporidia are identified in AIDS patients, the origin of these organisms is still in doubt. It remains uncertain whether these are previously unrecognised natural parasites of man, or zoonotic infections from another mammal (Canning and Hollister 1987) . Serological evidence suggests that latent infections may be quite com--man in man (Canning and Hollister 1987). Singh et al (1982) investigated the presence of antibodies to Nosema cuniculi in human and animal sera. Normal blood donors in Singapore did not have detectable antibody titres, but six out of 69 apparently normal Caucasians had a low titre of antibodies. They also detected high titres of antibodies in laboratory rabbits, and significant titres in 38 of 40 sheep. In a field trial in New Zealand, mob stocking of pastures by sheep was found to increase the number of microsporidial infections in the flock (Stewart and Archibald 1987) .",
