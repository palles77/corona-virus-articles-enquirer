In the present study, we explored the effects of ELF-EMF on behaviors of adult male rats. Sixty adult male rats were randomly divided into two groups, the sham exposure group and the 50 Hz/100 mT ELF-EMF exposure group. During the 24 weeks exposure, body weight, as well as food and water intake were recorded. Results showed that food and water intake and the body weight of the rats were not affected by the exposure. After 24 weeks exposure, open field test and elevated plus maze were conducted to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior, the tail suspension test and forced swim test were conducted to evaluate depression-like behavior and Morris water maze and fear conditioning tests were used to evaluate the cognitive and memory ability. Exposure to ELF-EMF did not induce any anxiety-like or depression-like behaviors compared with the sham exposure. Moreover, the cognitive and memory ability was not impaired by the ELF-EMF exposure. Furthermore, ELF-EMF exposure did not affect the morphology and histology of the brain. In conclusion, 24 weeks exposure to 50 Hz/100 mT ELF-EMF had no effect on the behaviors of the adult male rats.",

Recent studies have evaluated the effects of the ELF-EMF on cancer (Chen et al., 2013; Repacholi, 2012) , reproductive system (Al-Akhras et al., 2006; Huuskonen et al., 2001; Vallejo and Hidalgo, 2012) , endocrine system (Crasson et al., 2001; Karasek and Woldanska-Okonska, 2004; Taherianfard et al., 2013) as well as neurodegenerative diseases (Garcia et al., 2008; Reale et al., 2014; Sobel et al., 1995) . However, due to different exposure conditions, such as the duration and the intensity of exposure, there remains considerable controversy surrounding the safety of ELF-EMF.",

The accumulative distance traveled in the tank of the ELF-EMF exposure group was not significantly different from that of the control group (Fig. 4C) . Moreover, the time to cross the platform area was measured, and the results revealed that rats from control group remembered the platform area and swam across the area around 6 times in average, which was similar to the ELF-EMF exposed rats (Fig. 4D ). In addition, the effects of ELF-EMF on the spatial memory were further detected by the residence time spent in the target quadrant, which showed no significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 4E) .

In rodents, similar effects were observed. It was reported that chronic (4 h/day, 25 days) 2 mT ELF-EMF had anxiogenic effects on rats (Liu et al., 2008) . Besides, studies carried out by Del et al. showed that exposure to 80 mT magnetic field for 2 h altered behavioral patterns in OFT (Del Seppia et al., 2003) . However, it was reported recently that mice exposed to ELF-EMF (1 mT) for 14 days can still maintain normal anxiety-like behavior (Alsaeed et al., 2014) . In addition, Szemerszky et al. showed that 4-6 weeks exposure to 500 mT ELF-EMF had no effect on anxiety-like behavior (Szemerszky et al., 2010) . Similarly, Cosquer et al. reported that exposure to EMF for 45 min did not alter rat's anxiety responses assessed by the elevated plus maze (Cosquer et al., 2005) . In our present study, we carried out OFT and EPM to evaluate the effects of 100 mT ELF-EMF on anxietylike behavior. Results from both tests revealed that 6 months exposure to ELF-EMF did not influence anxiety level of the animals. The conflicting results between our study and others may due to the differences in experimental conditions, such as the exposure intensity, exposure duration. Nevertheless, it should be noted that our ELF-EMF source was very stable and uniform, which makes our results more persuasive.",

Analogously, in the present study, we used the TST and FST to observe the depressive state of the rats. Results showed no significant difference between the two groups. The different results among studies may be due to various intensity of ELF-EMF investigated.

In previous study, our group had shown that 100 mT ELF-EMF exposure for 12 weeks did not affect the spatial learning in MWM (Zhang et al., 2015b) . In the present study, similar results were observed even though the exposure time was prolonged to 24 weeks. Studies carried out by Li et al. suggested that 100 mT ELF-MF exposure did not interfere with the improvement in learning and memory capabilities (Li et al., 2014) . And this effect could also be observed in head-only exposure to EMF for 45 min (Dubreuil et al., 2003) . In contrast, Cui et al. found that ELF-MF exposure (1 mT, 50 Hz) for 12 weeks induced marked oxidative stress in the hippocampus and striatum and impaired hippocampus dependent spatial learning and striatum-dependent habit learning (Cui et al., 2012) , which was further confirmed by Maaroufi et al. They reported that rats exposed to EMF for 21 consecutive days were impaired in the object exploration task, and the monoamine content of hippocampus was altered (Maaroufi et al., 2014) .",
