Generally, the adoption of IT in healthcare has been slower than in other major industries [29] . This lag occurs because the healthcare industry poses major social and technological challenges to the development and use of information systems (IS) [5, 6] . Additionally, the multiple groups of actors in the healthcare industry, e.g., physicians, nurses, allied healthcare professionals, and administrators, increase the complexity of the adoption decision relative to other industries [29] . Among these groups, medical personnel who are largely autonomous [26] tend to differ from administrators in their attitude toward and requirements for IT due to their different objectives and skills [35] . Thus, healthcare IT must meet the needs of the various types of users. Furthermore, it is particularly challenging to justify the use of healthcare IT because most benefits accrue to external parties, such as patients, making the adoption decision difficult for organizations [44] . Hence, it would be valuable to study the healthcare IT pre-adoption process and adoption decision in relation to the different stakeholders in healthcare settings.",

Specifically, multi-stage models can contribute insights into the complex nature of technology adoption in organizations by revealing the linkages and temporal relationships among events as implementation processes unfold [16] . In this regard, taking a multi-stage approach allows the influence of various activities at different stages of the pre-adoption phase to be investigated. This approach also provides a means to study the roles played by different stakeholders during the pre-adoption phase, which can affect technology adoption decision outcomes [25] . The vast majority of previous multi-stage models (e.g., [15] ) have focused on the technology adoption process in general, and few models have been developed for the healthcare context or the organizational IT preadoption process in particular. The latter models are valuable due to the specific characteristics of healthcare IT previously described. Hence, we develop a multi-stage framework for IT pre-adoption that is specific to the healthcare context, as recommended in previous research [5] .",

This study draws on the contrasting vital signs monitoring system adoption projects of two hospitals to answer the following research question: ''How can healthcare IT pre-adoption be conducted to obtain beneficial outcomes?'' In our context, a beneficial outcome implies the adoption of a high-quality system that is useful or the non-adoption of a poor-quality or not useful system. Because our purpose is theory building, we adopt an exploratory case study approach [9] . We first review concepts from relevant existing multi-stage models to identify a priori concepts of innovation pre-adoption to shape the initial research design, as recommended by Eisenhardt [11] . Subsequently, we develop a theoretical framework based on our case analysis to explain the process of healthcare IT pre-adoption in organizations.",

This approach also provides a means to study the impact of contextual factors (i.e., task, technological and organizational characteristics) on stakeholders at various stages, which can explain organizational technology adoption outcomes [25] . Because organizational technology adoption is more complex than an individual adoption decision [23] , the value of multi-stage models is demonstrated when we open the ''black box'' of preadoption to reveal the stages and sub-stages within this phase to aid in the organizational technology adoption decision.

Originally used to examine the assimilation of software process innovations, recent research has adapted the model to other contexts, e.g., inter-organizational business process standards assimilation [2] , electronic procurement innovations [38] , and assimilation of electronic medical records [39] . Although this model has been used in the healthcare context [39] , there has not been an in-depth examination of the stages and sub-stages leading to the organizational adoption decision. To gain insights about the healthcare IT organizational adoption decision, we investigate the stages of pre-adoption in detail. While this model [15] describes six stages, ranging from awareness to general deployment of a new IS, our research focuses on the first four stages, i.e., awareness, interest, and evaluation/trial, which relate to pre-adoption, and commitment, which represents the organizational decision to adopt the technology. Because the two remaining stages relate to implementation, we will not examine them. The four stages of the Fichman and Kemerer [15] model that are relevant to pre-adoption are described in Table 1 .",

Both hospitals belong to the same healthcare group (StarHealth), which reduces extraneous variation [47] because their innovation orientations are likely to align with the vision of the group. Thus, examining hospitals in the same group provides a consistent setting for comparing technology pre-adoption processes. Furthermore, these hospitals were selected because both were conducting projects to implement wireless technologies for vital signs monitoring but made different adoption decisions, i.e., one proceeded to full-scale adoption while the other did not. Therefore, our multiple-case design adopts a theoretical replication logic [9, 47] in which the conditions of the cases lead to contrasting predicted outcomes in terms of the organizational decision to adopt the vital signs monitoring system. Through an in-depth analysis, we examine the stages and sub-stages preceding the adoption decisions of two hospitals. Using two cases for comparison allows similarities and differences to be derived and allows more robust theory development [11] .",

The use of multiple investigators can improve confidence in and reliability of the results [9] . Multiple data collection methods were used to allow for triangulation of sources and increase the reliability of the findings [47] . The primary data collection method was interviews with project members performing various roles from both hospitals. Interviews were conducted shortly after both hospitals concluded their trials of the vital signs monitoring systems. Secondary data collection was based on project documents and presentation slides provided by both hospitals. The project documents included details on project objectives; schedules; specifications; data collected by the hospitals during the projects, such as feedback from nurses and patients; and results of timing studies. Additionally, the researchers conducted three days of field observations at the hospitals. These field observations provided the researchers with context for the interview questions asked of project team members and familiarity with clinical jargon. Table 4 lists the interviewees. All key project personnel as well as nurses who were available during the data collection period were interviewed. The number of interviewees for each case differed because the project team for TwoHospital was smaller. Nevertheless, we were able to capture the entire sequence of substages for both cases. The sessions were semi-structured to allow the interviewers to probe themes and opportunities that arose during the conversation with interviewees. The interview questions were tailored according to the project role of the interviewee, beginning with questions about the events that occurred in the project followed by questions to probe the various stages of the project (see the Appendix for the interview guide). The interview data were analyzed after each session to adjust subsequent data collection [9] . Each interview session lasted an average of 60 min for project managers and technology solution providers/vendors and 45 min for nurses. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. A total of 225 pages of transcripts resulted from this process. Subsequently, QSR (QSR International Pty Ltd, Victoria, Australia) NVivo 9 software for qualitative analysis was used to code the interview data.",

The system makes use of the hospital wireless network infrastructure. This system monitors six vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, temperature, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, 3 and respiration rate. Each patient wears an RFID tag for identification. Through this system, digital vital sign charts are generated automatically, replacing the patient charts manually maintained by nurses. This system also enables clinicians to view digital charts anytime and anywhere. Fig. 2 describes the general architecture the wireless vital signs monitoring systems. Although the technology solution vendors for both cases were different, the solutions worked similarly. Because wireless biosensors are portable, patients are allowed to move freely around the hospital during monitoring.",

This research complements the variance method by developing a process framework for organizational healthcare IT pre-adoption. Our framework helps explicate the stages and sub-stages of healthcare IT pre-adoption, and at each sub-stage, we have indicated the conditions (e.g., healthcare issue-driven vs. IT-driven awareness) that contribute to beneficial outcomes. Because these conditions are represented as binary based on the findings of our two cases, we are unable to measure the degree to which each factor can influence the pre-adoption process. Therefore, it would be beneficial for future research to extend this work into a variance model using these and other potential factors as antecedents.",

First, the proposed framework in Fig. 3 is relevant to practitioners because it is developed to be implemented in organizations conducting their healthcare IT pre-adoption processes. The four main stages include sub-stages and approaches that are prescriptive and promote organizational best practices based our case studies (see Table 5 ). These approaches can collectively increase the likelihood of a beneficial outcome in the organizational healthcare IT adoption decision. For example, within the initiation stage, a clinically triggered project might give medical practitioners more control over the direction of the project, which may lead to additional customization and improved acceptance of the system. Within the Pre-Trial Preparation Stage, organizations can manage their IT adoption process to form a project team with steering roles and enlist a project champion with a decision-making role to encourage a beneficial outcome.",
