In such a situation vaccination is considered as a better option to prevent such infections. In the current study reverse vaccinology approach has been used to select peptides from already known immunogenic proteins to design a chimeric construct. We selected Yersiniabactin receptor of Escherichia coli UMN026 and Flagellin of Stenotrophomonas maltophila. B-cell linear epitopes were predicted using Bepipred prediction tool. Peptide binding with reference sets of 27 alleles of MHC class I and class II was also analyzed. The predicted peptides-MHC complexes were further validated using simulation dynamics. The insilico construction of chimera was done by restriction mapping and codon optimization. Chimera was evaluated using the immunoinformatic approach as done for the selected proteins. From the 673 amino acids of FyuA protein, a region from 1 to 492 was selected for containing more linear epitopes and the processing scores obtained were significant for MHC class I and class II binding. Similarly, from Flagellin, a region between 60 and 328 amino acids was selected and the peptides present in the selected region showed lower percentile ranks for binding with MHC molecules. The simulation studies validated the predictions of peptide-MHC complexes. The selected gene fragments accommodating maximum part of these peptides were used to design a chimaeric construct of 2454 bp. From the immunoinformatic analysis, the chimera was found to be more immunogenic in terms of increased number of B-cell and T-cell epitopes along with increased coverage of global populations with allelic variability.",

            "text": "Communicable diseases caused by members of Enterobacteriaceae family put a great burden on the society by affecting humans and their livestocks. These infections become quite severe when they are not controlled on time. Some of the examples include pneumonia, pyogenic liver abscess, pyelonephritis and septicemia [1] . The treatment has become difficult due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance among some of the pathogens. Due to the existing challenge of treating these infections with antibiotics, it is inevitable for the research community to look forward to prophylactic means for the prevention of these infections. A large number of vaccine candidates have been proposed by various researchers for specific infections. However, evaluation of individual vaccine candidates under in-vivo infection conditions is an enduring task. In the recent years, \"Reverse Vaccinology\" (RV) has come to play an important role in scrutinizing the vaccine candidates by in-silico analysis [2] thereby reducing the time required for ruling out ineffective candidates. This immunoinformatic approach is being frequently used by researchers to predict the epitopes on viruses. This has led to the finding of epitopes on nucleocapsid protein and ovarian tumour domain of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus [3] . Another study investigated the variability among epitopes of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) identified in genotype 1 and also predicted the immunogenicity of their variants from other genotypes against South African human leukocyte antigen (HLA) backgrounds [4] . Epitopes of E1 protein isolated from HCV have also been identified using the similar approach [5] . Effective immunogens of MERS-CoV have been discovered through immunoinformatics-driven genome-wide screening strategy [6] . Goodswen et al. [7] have also used this technique for designing protein based vaccines against eukaryotic pathogens. Reverse vaccinology has already been used against other bacterial pathogens like Group B streptococcus, where genomic analysis has led to the development of a vaccine composed of four proteins giving protection against all serotypes [8] . Another In-silico study has found a protein Bam A of Acinetobacter baumanii to be a potential immunogen [9] . RV has also been implied to predict the potential vaccine candidates from the proteome of Burkholderia pseudomallei [10] . The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of these Gram-negative bacteria are usually considered as potent vaccine candidates as they are exposed to the host immune defenses [11] . These OMPs are not always conserved in different genus of bacteria but their lies a probability of presence of some conserved peptide sequence in these OMPs. In this study we have taken into account the proteins which have proved to be potential vaccine candidates on the basis of invivo research work on animal models. Yersiniabactin receptor FyuA is highly conserved protein prevalent in various members of Enterobacteriaceae. As per the reports, FyuA mediates the uptake of ferricyersiniabactin [12, 13] confirming its role in the virulence of bacteria, which makes it an important vaccine candidate. Moreover researchers have found it as a potential vaccine candidate against pyelonephritis in a murine model of urinary tract infection [14] . It has also been found to be protective in murine model of pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae 43816 in our laboratory (manuscript under communication). The Flagellin protein is another potential vaccine candidate which has been included in this study. Various studies have established the role of flagellin in inducing a systemic inflammatory response via intraperitoneal and intravenous administration [15, 16] and a local inflammatory response with intraintestinal administration [17, 18] . In our lab, flagellin of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has been shown to induce non-specific immune response which protected mice against subsequent bacterial challenge [19] . In the current study both of these vaccine candidates have been analyzed using IEDB server to design a novel insilico vaccine construct harbouring the properties of both these proteins.",

For FyuA a threshold score of 0.332 for a window size of 7 amino acids was generated in the portal. Results in Fig. 1(A) show that a large number of linear epitopes are present in FyuA and most of the prominent epitopes were in the region from amino acid position 20 to 520. The maximum score of 2.317 was obtained for the amino acids near position 160. Similarly, linear epitopes were predicted for Flagellin with the Bepipred generated threshold value of 0.316 for a window size of 7 amino acids. Results in Fig. 1(B) show a large number of linear epitopes on Flagellin and most of the prominent epitopes were in the region from amino acid position 20 to 380. The maximum value of 1.680 was obtained for the amino acids near position110. The peptides that were significant linear epitopes are shown here in Table 1 . Results of Bepipred prediction as shown in Fig. 1 revealed the presence of a wide range of linear epitopes on both FyuA and Flagellin proteins. These results were further verified using other parameters like hydrophilicity, surface accessibility and antigenicity. Similar results were obtained from all the above predictions as both the proteins were found to possess large number of linear epitopes (Supplementary information SI.1.). The region accommodating the maximum number of epitopes was then selected to be taken further for theoretical construction of chimaera. Further, evaluation of other parameters was done by keeping the selected regions into consideration. Since, there lies a possibility that the chimeric protein may not take up the proper folding when over expressed due to physical constraint of large size. Hence, it may be expressed as inclusion bodies when subjected to over expression. Misfolding of protein would certainly not affect the T-cell dependent response since the generation of T-cell response depends on the processing and presentation of peptides on MHC molecules but it may affect the antibody response to conformational epitopes. However, Results in Table 1show Table 1 . Therefore, the presence of linear epitopes can be considered as a very significant feature of the vaccine candidate protein as it could help in the generation of antibody response even if the protein is administered in denatured form.",
