It has been known that SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) is a novel human coronavirus and is responsible for SARS infection. Belonging to one of the major proteins associated with SARS_CoV, SARS 3C-like protease (SARS_3CL pro ) functions as a cysteine protease engaging in the proteolytic cleavage of the viral precursor polyprotein to a series of functional proteins required for coronavirus replication and is considered as an appealing target for designing anti-SARS agents. To facilitate the studies regarding the functions and structures of SARS_3CL pro , in this report the synthetic genes encoding 3CL pro of SARS_CoV were assembled, and the plasmid was constructed using pQE30 as vector and expressed in Escherichia coli M15 cells. The highly yielded ($15 mg/L) expressed protease was purified by use of NTA-Ni 2\u00fe affinity chromatography and FPLC system, and its sequence was determined by LC/MS with the residue coverage of 46.4%.",

By using biophysical and biochemical techniques such as electron microscopy, virus-discovery microarrays containing conserved nucleotide sequences characteristic of many virus families, randomly primed RT-PCR, and serological tests, it has been determined that SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) is responsible for SARS infection [1] [2] [3] . Coronavirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus with halo or corona appearance if viewed under a microscope and involves the largest viral RNA genomes known to date. The studies have suggested that SARS_CoV is a previously unknown coronavirus, which belongs neither to a mutant of any known coronavirus nor a recombinant of known coronaviruses; it is believed to be a novel human coronovirus possibly originated from a nonhuman host [4, 5] .",

It has been known that the replicase gene for encoding the proteins required for coronavirus replication and transcription encompasses more than 20,000 nucleotides [8, 9] and encodes two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a (replicase 1a, around 450 kDa) and pp1ab (replicase 1ab, around 750 kDa), which feature the sequence motifs of both papain-like cysteine protease and the 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) [10, 11] . Recently, the genome sequencings deposited in the GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for the SARS_CoV from different SARS patients have laid a potent foundation for the research of SARS pathogenesis and anti-SARS drug design [12] [13] [14] . The fact has been demonstrated that the important proteins associated with the SARS_CoV infection involve the RNA polymerase, the spike (S) glycoprotein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and the main protease, 3Clike (3CL pro ) protease [15, 16] . As the viral main protease, 3CL pro functions as a protease to control the activities of the coronavirus replication complex [17, 18] .",

Coronavirus main proteases employ conserved cysteine and histidine residues in the catalytic site and lack acidic active site residue [6, [19] [20] [21] . The results have also confirmed that for coronavirus main proteases their substrate specificities are also well defined, with the known cleavage sites involving bulky hydrophobic residues (mainly leucine) at the P2 position, glutamine at the P1 position, and small aliphatic residues at the P1 0 position [17, 18] . In addition, the recent determination of the crystal structures for human coronavirus (strain 229E) 3CL pro and for an inhibitor complex of porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV) 3CL pro also confirms a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate binding sites for coronavirus 3CL pro [16] . In fact, the studies have already shown that 3CL pro is a useful target for screening anti-virus agents [18, 22, 23] . Like other 3CL pro , it is hopeful that SARS_3CL pro will surely become an appealing target in discovering new agents for the treatment of SARS [16] .",

Most of the b and y ions were detected (>80%). The total number of amino acids contained within the eleven tryptic peptides was 145 (Scheme 1), with the protein coverage at 46.4%. The molecular weight of 3CL pro was also determined by the LC-MS system. The LC condition was based on that above described for peptide separation. An LC peak at a retention time of 18 min was observed (data not shown). Mass spectrum corresponding to this LC peak gave a multiple charge ion (Fig. 4) . The molecular weight was obtained by deconvolution algorithm in ''sequest'' program. The measured mass of 3CL pro protease is 35831 (Fig. 5 ) and the difference between measured and theoretical mass (mw.35832) was only 1 dalton. These results completely determine the identity of the expressed SARS_3CL pro in this work.",
