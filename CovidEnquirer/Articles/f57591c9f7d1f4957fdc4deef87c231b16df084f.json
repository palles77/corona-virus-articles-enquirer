We now demonstrate that HSV-2 mediates an unusual intracellular sequestering of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. With use of an RNase protection assay, we observed a selective inhibition of IFN-y and IL-6 gene transcfil~tion in brains of mice infected with HSV-2. It is likely that the inhibition of cytokine gene expression was mediated through a failure to activate CD4 + lymphocytes. These data suggest that the infecting herpesvirus can influence the profile of intracerebrally produced cytokines, which in turn may determine the outcome of the infection.",

Although it is generally accepted that the T cell-mediated immune response is necessary to limit viral spread and to aid in establishing the latent HSV infection in neurons, the mechanism underlying antiviral action in the nervous system remains largely undefined. The T cell-mediated eradication of infectious HSV from neurons is likely to be complex, since neither neurons nor gila express detectable antigens of either major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II constitutively (Wong et al., 1984; Lampson and Hickey, 1986; Joly and Oldstone, 1991) . Consequently, it is unlikely that infectious HSV is eliminated from neurons by immune-mediated cell lysis. Alternatively, production of soluble anti-herpetic mediators acting at the level of the infected neurons has been suggested (Rossol-Voth et al., 1991; .",

The T cellmediated immune response to viral infections in the brain is characterized by the induction of MHC class I and II antigen expression on non-neuronal cells (Olsson et al., 1987; Deschl et al., 1990; Joseph et al., 1990; Weinstein et al., 1990) and recruitment of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes (Olsson et al., 1987; Chan et al., 1989; Deschl et al., 1990; Williamson et al., 1991) . Subsequently, cytokines such as type I and II interferons, IL-6, and IL-2 are also produced by activated T lymphocytes in restricted regions of viral infection. Thus, it is likely that the extent of neuronal damage and/or eradication of viral infection is affected by a complex network of interacting soluble factors produced by both resident brain cells and infiltrating cells.",

Preliminary characterization of the immune response in the brains of infected mice indicates that the induction of MHC class II gene expression and the recruitment of T lymphocytes to restricted regions of viral infection in the CNS occurs following ocular inoculation with either HSV-1 or HSV-2. However, HSV-2 appears to interfere with MHC class II-restricted viral antigen presentation by inhibiting the expression of MHC class II antigens at the plasma membrane (Lewandowski et al., 1993) . Therefore, we postulated that inhibition of MHC class II-restricted viral antigen presentation by HSV-2 would greatly affect the profile of intracerebrally produced cytokines by CD4 \u00f7 cells and, thus, could significantly influence the outcome of infection. The data reported in this communication demonstrate that the profile of intracerebral cytokine gene transcription is significantly altered in mice infected with HSV-2, and that this phenomenon may result from HSV-2-mediated inhibition of MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation in the brains and trigeminal sensory ganglia.",

Virus yield was determined by titration of serial dilutions of HSV on Vero cells and expressed as pfu/ml. HSV-1 strain F (HSV-I(F)) was a gift from Bernard Roizman, (University of Chicago, IL) and the initial stock of the lethal strain of HSV-2 was a provided by Rachel Schrier, (University of California, San Diego, CA). Subsequent to a previous publication in which the lethal strain of HSV-2 was referred to as HSV-I(KOS) (Lewandowski et al., 1993) , this virus was sereotypically identified as a strain of HSV-2. Accordingly, we now refer to this strain of HSV as HSV-2. A large stock of each virus strain was prepared from a first round plaque-purified clone.",

However, a second population of MHC class II-positive, Mac-l-negative cells was also observed. Two possible cell types exist for this phenotype: astrocytes or neurons. Previously we observed that HSV-2-infected regions of brain are negative for the astrocyte marker, GFAP (data not shown).

Using an RNase protection assay, we determined the induction profile of a series of cytokine transcripts in the brains of mice infected with either HSV-1 or HSV-2. Using an extensive probe set, six major cytokine transcripts were detected: TNF-a, TNF-/3, IFN-T, IL-6, IL-la and IL-1/3 (Fig. 7) . All of these cytokine transcripts were abundantly expressed and detected by 5 days postinfection 123456 4. Discussion Fig. 7 . Production of IFN-y and IL-6 is significantly inhibited in HSV-2-infected brains. Cytokine transcription was not detected in brains from mock-infected mice (lane 1), HSV-1-(lane 2) or HSV-2-(lane 3) infected mice at 3 dpi. The positions of all possible cytokine transcripts obtainable with the probe set used are indicated to the right of lane 6.

There was a significant inhibition of IFN-y and IL-6 gene transcription in HSV-2-infected brains (lane 5), whilst TNF-a, TNF-fl, IL-la and IL-1/3 gene transcription was similar to that seen in HSV-l-infected brains. Only the levels of IFN-y and IL-6 return to near baseline in HSV-l-infected brains (7 dpi, lane 6).

In the probable absence of MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation in HSV-2-infected neural tissues, it is unlikely that the recruited CD4 + cells would be activated, greatly influencing the production of T-cell-related cytokines. We have demonstrated that the profile of cytokine gene transcription in HSV-2-infected brains is significantly modified. Based on the profile of the major cytokines induced in HSV-l-infected brains, there is a notable suppression of IFN-y and IL-6 production. Failure to activate CD4 + cells could decrease IFN-y production through both direct and indirect mechanisms. First, production of IFN-y by activated CD4 + cells (TH1 subtype) (Mosmann et al., 1986) , a primary source of IFN-7, would be greatly reduced. Second, the production of IFN-y by CD8 + T cells and natural killer cells would also be significantly diminished, since IFN-y production from natural killer and CD8 + cells is enhanced by IL-2 produced by activated CD4 + cells (reviewed in Swain et al., 1991) . However, as is evident in Fig. 7 , the induction of IFN-y was not completely blocked, suggesting that the inhibition of CD4 + T cell activation is not 100%, and/or that IFN-7 is being produced by IL-2-independent CD8 + T cells. We have immunohistochemically detected comparable numbers of CD4 +-, CD8 +-, and natural killer cells in brain tissues from mice infected with either HSV-1 or HSV-2 (Lewandowski et al., 1993; and Lewandowski, unpublished data) . In context of the cellular localization of MHC class I and MHC class II immunoreactivity in HSV-2-infected brain tissue, the selective impairment of IFN-y and IL-6 transcription strongly suggests a functional inhibition of MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation in brains of HSV-2-infected mice. The inhibition of CD4 + activation should also be evidenced by significant reductions in IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 production. With our current RNAse protection assay we have not yet detected significant production of IL-2, IL-4 or IL-5 in HSV-2-infected brains. However, since a very extensive probe set was used, it is possible that less abundant cytokine transcripts were masked by the highly expressed cytokine transcripts migrating near them. Currently we are investigating the possible production of other less abundant cytokine gene transcripts, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-12, by using more limited cytokine probe sets.",

This suggestion is supported by previous reports that IFN promotes survival and viral clearance in herpesvirus-infected mice (Kumano et al., 1987; Yamada et al., 1988; Kunder et al., 1993) and inhibition of viral replication in cell culture systems (Svennerholm et al., 1989) . Most recently the antiviral actions of IFN-induced proteins have been investigated (Sokawa et al., 1980; Croen, 1993; Karupiah et al., 1993) . In our studies the production of IFN-7 corresponds to the time-course of infection with HSV-I: the levels peak during the acute infection stage (5 dpi) and decrease to near baseline levels when the infection is largely resolved (7 dpi) (Lewandowski et al., 1993) . The levels of other measured cytokine messages remained elevated even when viral proteins were no longer detectable (7 dpi).",

IL-6 has multiple actions (reviewed in Van Snick, 1990) including roles in B cell differentiation, in T cell activation, and as an inducer of acute phase proteins. It is likely that the inhibition of IL-6 production in the HSV-2-infected brains greatly disrupts regulation of the intricate network of cytokines produced during viral infections.",

            "text": "In summary, we postulate that neurotropic viruses that cause neuronal damage, but are able to evade CNS immune surveillance, can evoke a general inflammation in the CNS. In the absence of T-cell activation, cytokines with putative antiviral actions may not be produced. However, cytokines and monokines produced by resident brain cells in response to neuronal damage with pro-inflammatory, catabolic properties, e.g. TNF-a, TNF-/3, IL-6, IL-la, and IL-1/3 (Arai et al., 1990; Hartung et al., 1992; Merrill et al., 1992; Dickson et al., 1993) may further neuronal damage without abating the viral infection. In these studies we demonstrated that a lethal strain of HSV-2 evades immune surveillance in both the peripheral and central nervous systems through inhibition of antigen presentation, and propose that this inhibition of antigen presentation significantly influences the profile of cytokines produced. Since IL-2 and IFN-7 are not inducible in glial cells, the cytokine profile observed in the HSV-2-infected brains may reflect primarily the glial cell response to the viral infection in the brain. Our data suggest that the combination of intracerebrally produced cytokines (of both lymphocyte and glial origin) may determine the outcome of viral infections in the brain. An extensive examination of the transcrip-tional profiles of several cytoldnes in HSV-1 and HSV-2-infected brains and trigeminal ganglion nerves is now underway to determine if transcription of other CD4 + cell-dependent cytokines is similarily altered.",
