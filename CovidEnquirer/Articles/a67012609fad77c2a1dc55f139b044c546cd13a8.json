Here, we report a novel batorigin CoV causing severe and fatal pneumonia in humans. Methods: We collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from five patients with severe pneumonia from Jin Yin-tan Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Nucleic acids of the BAL were extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing. Virus isolation was carried out, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed. Results: Five patients hospitalized from December 18 to December 29, 2019 presented with fever, cough, and dyspnea accompanied by complications of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chest radiography revealed diffuse opacities and consolidation. One of these patients died. Sequence results revealed the presence of a previously unknown b-CoV strain in all five patients, with 99.8% to 99.9% nucleotide identities among the isolates. These isolates showed 79.0% nucleotide identity with the sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank NC_004718) and 51.8% identity with the sequence of MERS-CoV (GenBank NC_019843). The virus is phylogenetically 1 closest to a bat SARS-like CoV (SL-ZC45, GenBank MG772933) with 87.6% to 87.7% nucleotide identity, but is in a separate clade. Moreover, these viruses have a single intact open reading frame gene 8, as a further indicator of bat-origin CoVs. However, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that these viruses might use the same receptor. Conclusion: A novel bat-borne CoV was identified that is associated with severe and fatal respiratory disease in humans.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with a single positive-stranded RNA genome (\u223c26-32 kb in length). They belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae under the family Coronaviridae, and are classified into four genera: Alphacoronaviruses (a), Betacoronaviruses (b), Gammacoronaviruses (g), and Deltacoronaviruses (d). [1, 2] The viral genome normally encodes four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as several non-structural proteins and multiple unique accessory proteins. [1, 2] CoVs infect humans and a variety of avian and mammalian species worldwide. There are six CoVs known to infect humans, including two a-CoVs (229E and NL63) and four b-CoVs (OC43, HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]-CoV). [1] [2] [3] [4] All human CoVs are zoonotic as a distinguishing characteristic. [5] In particular, bats are regarded as a key reservoir of CoVs, and many human CoVs are believed to have originated from bats. [5, 6] Since the beginning of this century, two zoonotic CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, have been identified to cause severe human diseases. [3, 4, 7] The outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003 was responsible for 8096 cases and 794 deaths worldwide. [8] Since its discovery in Middle Eastern countries in 2012, MERS-CoV has infected 2260 people with a current case fatality rate of 35.5%. [9, 10] These outbreaks have raised public health concerns of the potential for the emergence of another novel zoonotic CoV.",

Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of the tentative receptor-binding domain (RBD) of this new CoV resembles that of SARS-CoV, indicating that they might use the same receptor.

A 50-mL elution was obtained from each sample. The DNA/ RNA concentrations were measured by a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

[15] A negative control sample was processed and sequenced in parallel for each sequencing run as a contamination control. The data were classified by simultaneous alignment to the microbial genome databases comprising viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites after filtering of the adapters and human-origin reads. The sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing with specific primers and one-step real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). ",

The most closely related known viruses are two bat SL-CoVs (GenBank accession nos.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that this virus forms Consequently, great efforts have been made to monitor novel emerging CoVs and to trace their origins so as to establish a risk assessment and alert system for preventing potential epidemics in the human population. Clarification of the coronavirome in animals, particularly in bats as a key reservoir of a wide range of CoVs, should be a priority for any task force. [23, 24] A few striking features of these novel CoVs indicated that they are of bat-origin. First, the genome sequences of the novel CoVs show high similarity with that of bat SL-CoV ZC45. Second, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that these viruses are evolutionarily close to bat SL-CoVs ZXC21 and ZC45. Third, all of these novel CoVs contain ORF3 and intact ORF8 gene regions, which are characteristic features of bat-origin CoVs. [17, 20] Moreover, the aa sequences of the N-terminal domains (NTDs) of the novel CoVs were very similar to those of ZC45 and ZXC21, whereas the RBD of the novel CoV showed higher aa sequence identity to that of SARS-CoV than to those of ZC45 and ZXC21, suggesting that a recombination event might have occurred at the region between the NTD and RBD of the S gene, facilitating the interspecies transmission.",

[26] However, two of our patients did not have a history of exposure to the seafood market. Therefore, further investigation will be needed to determine the potential of multiple infection sources responsible for this uncommon outbreak. One of the most striking and concerning features of this virus is its ability to cause severe respiratory syndrome. The disease progressed rapidly with a major presentation of lower respiratory pathology. Notably, no obvious upper respiratory tract symptoms such as a sore throat and rhinorrhea were present in these patients. Therefore, further exploration is needed on the distribution of the viral receptor in the organs to potentially account for pathogenesis development. In addition, the possibility of unrecognized mild infections or subclinical infections should be clarified, as identification of such infections is critical to control spread of the disease. Development of serological assays would be largely beneficial to detect such types of infection at the population level.",
