            "text": "Influenza viruses have segmented genomes and show great antigenic diversity. Of the three types of influenza viruses-A, B, and C-only types A and B cause widespread outbreaks. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on antigenic differences between their two surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase. 15 haemagglutinin subtypes (H1-H15) and nine neuraminidase subtypes (N1-N9) have been identified for influenza A viruses (figure 1). Viruses of all haemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes have been recovered from aquatic birds, but only three haemagglutinin subtypes (H1, H2, and H3) and two neuraminidase subtypes (N1 and N2) have established stable lineages in the human population since 1918. Only one subtype of haemagglutinin and one of neuraminidase are recognised for influenza B viruses. 1733 Although most influenza infections are self-limited, few other diseases exert such a huge toll of suffering and economic loss. Despite the importance of influenza, there had been, until recently, little advance in its control since amantadine was licensed almost 40 years ago. During the past decade, evidence has accrued on the protection afforded by inactivated vaccines and the safety and efficacy in children of live influenza-virus vaccines. There have been many new developments in vaccine technology. Moreover, work on viral neuraminidase has led to the licensing of potent selective antiviral drugs, and economic decision modelling provides further justification for annual vaccination and a framework for the use of neuraminidase inhibitors. Progress has also been made on developing near-patient testing for influenza that may assist individual diagnosis or the recognition of widespread virus circulation, and so optimise clinical management. Despite these advances, the occurrence of avian H5N1, H9N2, and H7N7 influenza in human beings and the rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome are reminders of our vulnerability to an emerging pandemic. The contrast between recent cases of H5N1 infection, associated with high mortality, and the typically mild, self-limiting nature of human infections with avian H7N7 and H9N2 influenza shows the gaps in our understanding of molecular correlates of pathogenicity and underlines the need for continuing international research into pandemic influenza. Improvements in animal and human surveillance, new approaches to vaccination, and increasing use of vaccines and antiviral drugs to combat annual influenza outbreaks are essential to reduce the global toll of pandemic and interpandemic influenza.",

The data for this non-systematic review of articles were identified by searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Integrated Science Citation Index, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library electronic databases with relevant keywords. We also searched cited references in retrieved articles, reviewed articles we have collected over many years, referred to the Textbook of Influenza, 2 and used knowledge of new data presented at international scientific meetings. Because of the large number of articles that are published every year and limitations on the number of citations, we gave emphasis to clinically relevant issues, particularly disease burden, the emergence of new subtypes, vaccines, and antivirals, and diagnosis. We gave priority to randomised controlled trials when available, to larger studies, articles published in high-impact journals that have a wide readership, and the systematic review and economic decision modelling, for the prevention and treatment of influenza, commissioned by the Health Technology Assessment Programme on behalf of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. 1 We also drew on our own knowledge when it seemed appropriate to fill in the gaps in the published work and included several recent pertinent articles.",

It is the major antigenic determinant of type A and B viruses to which neutralising antibodies are directed and the crucial component of current influenza vaccines. An important function of neuraminidase, the second major antigenic determinant, is to catalyse the cleavage of glycosidic linkages to sialic acid, thereby assisting in the release of progeny virions from infected cells. Accordingly, neuraminidase has become an important target for antiviral activity. The M2 ion channel of influenza A, which is blocked by the antiviral drug amantadine, regulates the internal pH of the virus, which is crucial during early viral replication.",

            "text": "The epidemiological behaviour of influenza in people is related to the two types of antigenic variation of its envelope glycoproteins-antigenic drift and antigenic shift. During antigenic drift, new strains of virus evolve by accumulation of point mutations in the surface glycoproteins. The new strains are antigenic variants but are related to those circulating during preceding epidemics. This feature enables the virus to evade immune recognition, leading to repeated outbreaks during interpandemic years. Antigenic shift occurs with the emergence of a \"new\", potentially pandemic, influenza A virus that possesses a novel haemagglutinin alone or with a novel neuraminidase. The new virus is antigenically distinct from earlier human viruses and could not have arisen from them by mutation (figure 2).",

            "text": "Four or five pandemics of influenza occurred during the 20th century with intervals of 9-39 years. The H1N1 pandemic of 1918-19 was the most devastating, with 40-50 million deaths; an estimated 4\u00b79 million excess deaths, representing 2% of the population, occurred in India alone. However, the cumulative mortality from influenza during the intervening years is generally many times greater than that associated with pandemics. 3 Although influenza A or B viruses circulate virtually every winter in temperate zones of the northern and southern hemispheres, quantification of the burden of influenza on consultations, emergency-department examinations, hospital admissions, and mortality has been difficult because influenza lacks pathognomonic features, it cocirculates with other respiratory pathogens, and it causes a range of nonspecific complications, such as exacerbations of chronic cardiopulmonary disease. Nevertheless, there is much evidence that the H3N2 subtype of influenza A virus causes more severe illness than H1N1 or influenza B, 4-6 more hospital admissions for pneumonia and influenza, 7 and higher numbers of excess deaths. 3 During outbreaks, sentinel schemes, such as the Royal College of General Practitioners' network in England, report increased consultation rates for influenza-like illness and other respiratory syndromes that are strongly associated with excess mortality. 8 In England and Wales, an estimated 6200-29 600 people died during each of the epidemics between 1975-76 and 1989-90. 8 These estimates are about ten times the number of death certifications for influenza, because the disease is the cause of many \"hidden deaths\". In the USA, during the 9 About 90% of these influenzaassociated excess deaths are among people aged 65 years and older. Although there are age-related increases in deaths from influenzal illness in both at-risk and low-risk groups, 10 most deaths and hospital admissions occur in elderly people with chronic cardiopulmonary disorders. Among toddlers, rates of influenza-associated hospital admission in the USA have ranged from about 500 per 10 5 population for those with high-risk conditions to 100 per 10 5 for those without high-risk conditions. [11] [12] [13] [14] Admission rates are highest among children younger than 1 year and are similar to rates found among people aged 65 years and older. 13, 14 Among children in Hong Kong, China, the numbers of excess hospital admissions attributed to influenza are very high in children younger than 12 months (2785 and 2882 per 10 5 in 1998 and 1999, respectively) and decrease with age (2184 and 2093 per 10 5 children aged 12-23 months; 1256 and 773 per 10 5 children aged 2-4 years; 573 and 209 per 10 5 children aged 5-9 years; and 164 and 81 per 10 5 children aged 10-15 years). 15 In the tropics and subtropics, influenza occurs either throughout the year with no distinct seasonality or visible excess mortality, or twice a year, with the more intense activity during the rainy season. Consequently, the morbidity and mortality from influenza are probably greatly underestimated in these regions. During summer, 2002, an epidemic of respiratory illness with 22 646 cases and 3% case-mortality affected Madagascar; it was attributable to influenza A/Panama/ 2007/97-like (H3N2) virus. The loss of life was greatest in young children and was ascribed to malnutrition and poor access to health care. 16 Another outbreak attributable to influenza A/Panama/2007/97-like (H3N2) virus occurred during November and December, 2002, in the district of Bosobolo, Democratic Republic of Congo. The casefatality rate was 3\u00b75% in children younger than 5 years and 3\u00b72% in people over 65. These rates illustrate the seriousness of such outbreaks and are one of the reasons why improved linkage of morbidity and mortality analysis with virological surveillance is one of the key objectives of the WHO Global Agenda on Influenza, formulated in 2002.",

            "text": "In southern China, influenza viruses circulate throughout the year. There is evidence for the origin in China of the viruses that caused the pandemics of H2N2 influenza in 1957, H3N2 influenza in 1968, and the re-emergence of H1N1 influenza in 1977. Recent outbreaks of avian influenza A H5N1 and H9N2 in people in Hong Kong show the importance of virological surveillance in this region for the early detection of potentially pandemic viruses. There is also evidence that some drift variants circulate in China for up to 2 years before causing epidemics in Europe and North America. 17, 18 This region is thought to provide an appropriate ecological niche for the emergence of new influenza viruses with pandemic potential, owing to the proximity of dense populations of people, pigs, and wild and domestic birds, thereby facilitating genetic reassortment of viruses from different species (figure 2), or for the emergence of drift variants, given the high human population density and year-round virus circulation. These observations provided the impetus for improving the WHO global influenza surveillance programme in China that has provided many of the vaccine strains recommended by WHO in the past decade. The examples cited below indicate the unpredictability of influenza-virus variation and the great capacity for evolution, but they also show that novelty alone is insufficient for the emergence of pandemic influenza. Adaptation to replication in human beings, the ability to spread from person to person, and a susceptible population are also prerequisites. Thus, the emergence of new influenza-virus variants in the human population does not necessarily herald pandemic influenza.",

This outbreak, which followed serious outbreaks of avian H5N1 influenza in chicken farms, signalled the possibility of an incipient pandemic. The human influenza isolates were of avian origin and were not derived by reassortment. 19 The high mortality (six of 18 patients died from acute respiratory distress syndrome or multiple organ failure, most previously healthy young adults 20 ) suggested an unusually aggressive clinical course. Deterioration was rapid, with pneumonia necessitating ventilatory support developing within a few days of illness onset. Striking features of severe cases were the early onset of lymphopenia and high concentrations of serum transaminases. Fortunately, there were few if any secondary infections, and the H5N1 outbreak ceased when all chickens in Hong Kong (about 1\u00b75 million) were slaughtered. The territory's poultry stocks were again depopulated when highly pathogenic A/Hong Kong/97 (H5N1) virus reemerged in flocks in May, 2001, and February and April, 2002.

The illness in both was mild and self-limited. 22 No serological evidence of H9N2 infection was found in family members or health-care workers who had close contact with the children; thus, H9N2 viruses, like H5N1 viruses, seem not to be easily transmitted from person to person. 23 Three lineages of H9 virus have been defined, with the prototype viruses being G1, G9, and Y439. 24 The G1 \"avian\" H9N2 viruses isolated from human beings have some receptor properties similar to those of other human viruses-ie, binding to \u24232,6 sialic acid linkages, in contrast to the binding preference to the \u24232,3 linkages normally found with avian influenza viruses. In Hong Kong, antibody to H9 viruses was found in about 4% of blood donors, 22 which suggests that human infection with H9N2 may occur in this locality.

The person who died was a previously healthy 57-year old veterinary surgeon who developed severe headache, renal impairment, interstitial pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress after visiting an affected poultry farm. 31 Most patients presented with conjunctivitis (n=79), and only seven (<10%) had respiratory illness. Transmission of H7N7 influenza from poultry workers to family members was found on three occasions. 31 Most virus isolates obtained from human beings had not accumulated significant genetic changes, including those from cases of human-to-human transmission. However, the virus isolated from the person who died had 14 aminoacid substitutions, which suggests a role in pathogenicity.",

The molecular correlates of these pathogenic properties reside in the viral haemagglutinin and have been well studied.

Selective testing of specific mutations engineered into recombinant viruses in a mouse model has shown that greater virulence is obtained by specific molecular properties of haemagglutinin, but these do not fully explain pathogenicity. 54 The balance between viral replication and host immune response determines the outcome of viral infection. Highly virulent viruses, such as H5N1, have a remarkable capacity to resist the antiviral effects of host cytokines. 55 Infection of human macrophages also results in induction of high cytokine expression, suggesting that severe outcome of infection is due both to lack of inhibition of viral replication by cytokines and to excess induction of cytokines leading to tissue damage in the infected host. 56 The key genetic component determining replication of highly pathogenic virus may be the nonstructural protein 1 of the virus, which has been identified as the major immune modulator. 57 Factors contributing to the pathogenesis of influenza in people are incompletely understood. These include understanding of the nature of tissue restriction of proteases, differences in reactivity of the innate immune system at different stages of life, and varying susceptibilities in different human populations, leading to different ranges of disease in certain populations; for example, encephalopathy is well recognised in Japan, but less so in other populations. 58, 59 Study of mechanisms of virulence should provide more than simply elucidation of pathogenesis, notably development of alternative means of attenuating influenza viruses (eg, by deletion of non-structural protein or M2 [matrix protein 2] genes) to make safer vaccine strains.",

            "text": "Whole-virus vaccines are not widely available because they cause adverse reactions in young children, whereas split-product formulations and those containing purified surface antigen are well tolerated and extremely safe. The virtual absence of published reports suggests that hypersensitivity reactions are rare. Recent randomised controlled trials 60 Efficacy and effectiveness of current vaccines Studies on the efficacy and effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccines reveal substantial benefits. In children, meta-analysis 1 of double-blind 64-66 and singleblind 67,68 randomised controlled trials estimated the efficacy of vaccine in preventing symptomatic laboratory-confirmed influenza at 80% (table 2) . Other benefits include reductions in school absenteeism, otitis media, asthma exacerbations, and febrile respiratory illness in unvaccinated household contacts. 67, [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] In adults of working age, meta-analysis 1 of two randomised controlled trials of split influenza vaccines 69,70 estimated the efficacy in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza at 77% (table 2) . Associated benefits include reductions in absenteeism, consultations, antibiotic use, and use of over-thecounter medication. [80] [81] [82] The frequency of laboratory-confirmed influenza fell by 52% in vaccinees in a randomised controlled trial (table 2) 71 and by 94% in a prospective cohort study of elderly people living in the community. 83 Many cohort and case-control studies have shown lower rates of hospital admissions for pneumonia and influenza, 84-92 all respiratory disorders, 85,87 respiratory disorders and heart failure, 93 deaths from pneumonia and influenza, 84, 87 and all-cause mortality 85, 86, 94 in vaccinees than in controls (table 3) . A meta-analysis of reports published before 2001 showed that vaccination reduces numbers of cases of influenza-like illness by 35%, hospital admissions for pneumonia and influenza by 47%, and all-cause mortality by 50%. 95 A prospective observational study of 22 462 nursinghome residents in Japan showed a 60% reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenzal illness among vaccinees. 72 Vaccination also reduced numbers of hospital admissions among vaccine failures and thus appears to ameliorate illness severity. Gross and colleagues 96 did a meta-analysis of 20 cohort studies. The odds ratios for development of respiratory illness (0\u00b744) or pneumonia (0\u00b747), hospital admission (0\u00b750), and mortality (0\u00b732) indicate substantial protection.",

In children with influenza, the frequency of otitis media was 21% with placebo and 12% with oseltamivir. 131 The rate of antibiotic use in the intention-totreat population in one study was 3\u00b74% (eight of 235) with placebo and 0\u00b74% (one of 241) with treatment. 129 Pooled marginal analyses showed lower rates of antibiotic use for lower-respiratory-tract complications in \"healthy\" and \"high-risk\" people with influenza with oseltamivir than with placebo; 1 a lower frequency of pneumonia in the influenza-positive group of ten studies (2% among placebo recipients vs <1% with oseltamivir; table 5); 1 and a significant reduction in the occurrence of hospital admissions in influenza-positive populations of ten trials (1\u00b77% vs 0\u00b77%). 1 Three different strategies in preventing laboratoryconfirmed symptomatic influenza with oseltamivir have been investigated in randomised controlled trials.

Resistance involves either a mutation in the active site of the neuraminidase, altering its sensitivity to inhibition, or a mutation in the haemagglutinin. Mutations in haemagglutinin that confer drug resistance decrease the affinity of the protein for the cellular receptor, thus enabling virus to escape from infected cells without the need for viral neuraminidase.",

Within their licensed indications, zanamivir and oseltamivir are both recommended for the treatment of atrisk adults, and oseltamivir for the treatment of at-risk children, who present with influenza-like illness and can start therapy within 48 h of the onset of symptoms, when it is known that influenza A or B is circulating in the community. NICE guidance on the use of antiviral drugs for the prevention of influenza was also issued lately. 135 Oseltamivir is recommended for postexposure prophylaxis of influenza in at-risk people aged 13 years and older, who can begin prophylaxis within 48 h, if they live in a residential care establishment, whether or not they have been vaccinated, and a resident or staff member has influenza-like illness; or if they are not effectively protected by vaccination and can begin prophylaxis within 48 h of exposure. Oseltamivir is not recommended for postexposure prophylaxis of healthy people up to age 65 years or for seasonal prophylaxis. Amantadine is not recommended for either postexposure or seasonal prophylaxis. This guidance does not cover the circumstances of a pandemic.",

The problems encountered in 1997 were due mainly to the dangers of working with the chicken H5N1 virus and the need to produce a safe vaccine strain. Conventional technology was unable to produce a safe productive vaccine strain. However Li and colleagues 136 were able to modify the haemagglutinin gene of the A/Hong Kong/97 virus. They deleted the series of basic aminoacid residues at the cleavage site associated with virulence, then by use of reverse genetics rescued the modified haemagglutinin gene and the neuraminidase gene from the wild-type A/Hong Kong/97 virus into ca A/Ann Arbor/6/60 virus. The resultant ca virus was non-pathogenic in animal models of infection, grew well in eggs, and protected chickens from challenge with lethal virus; it could be a suitable candidate vaccine strain. These experiments show the potential for using reverse genetics technology to develop live and inactivated vaccines for both pandemic and interpandemic use.",

Clinical trials of conventional inactivated-surface-antigen vaccine produced from an H5N3 virus showed that extremely poor antibody responses were stimulated, even after two doses, whereas an H5N3 subunit vaccine with MF59 adjuvant was much more immunogenic. 138 The benefit of adjuvants for use in na\u00efve populations has also been shown with a whole-virus H2N2 vaccine with aluminium salts adjuvant. 139 Thus, like MF59, aluminium salts have promise in increasing vaccine coverage in response to pandemic influenza by allowing scarce antigen to be used more efficiently.",

WHO has recently prepared draft guidelines for use of both vaccines and antiviral drugs during a pandemic; 140 they emphasise the need to stockpile drugs and to develop plans for their distribution and use. As with vaccines, there are gaps in our knowledge as to how antiviral drugs should be used.

I dissected the heart and coronary vessels and decided they were atheromatous and that death was from natural causes, probably from myocardial ischaemia. In the coroner's court, I presented my conclusions and the case was closed. I received the pathologist's report as I was due to finish the locum . . . normal heart! Being on-call for a unit and not just one's own patients can be an onerous task, particularly as the staff become more numerous and anonymous. In the past 5 years, I have been required to be on-call for a unit of ten consultants at two hospitals, one of which I visit only when on call. I was telephoned in the middle of the night about a patient who had had a cardiac arrest. I did not recognise the patient's name. I was told the arrest team wanted me to advise on their \"enthusiasm\" for resuscitation. I said that if she was not readily resuscitated, they should not resort to extreme measures, presuming she was a cancer patient admitted under the care of one of my oncology colleagues. On visiting the ward the next morning, I learnt that the patient who had died was a young woman under my care. (I had been given her first name and not her surname). She had been successfully treated for ovarian cancer 10 years previously and had been diagnosed with metastatic disease a couple of weeks earlier. She was neutropenic after the first chemotherapy treatment and a fatal outcome was not anticipated, particularly since she was being treated with curative intent.",
