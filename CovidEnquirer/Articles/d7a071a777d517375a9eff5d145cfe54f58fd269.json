To determine risk factors associated with the introduction of PRCV, a cross-sectional study of 408 Danish swine herds was carried out between May 1985 and June 1986. The association between herd-PRCV serological status and possible risk factors, obtained from a field questionnaire, was assessed by unconditional maximum likelihood logistic regression. An increasing herd size, location in the Jutland peninsula (compared with location on the island of Funen) (OR = 7.9 in a multivariable logistic regression model not including interaction terms), the presence of a slurry system (i.e. pigs living on a slatted floor) (OR=4.6) and purchase of pigs (OR= 1.7) were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with seropositivity. Two significant interactions, both involving herd s#ize, were subsequently identified.",

The most striking differences between PRCV and TGEV are their site of replication and pathogenicity. PRCV principally multiplies in the respiratory tract, infecting epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages (Pensaert and Cox, 1989) . Thus, PRCV has been detected in nasal swabs of experimentally infected pigs (Onno et al., 1989; Wesley et al., 1990) but not in the faeces, as is typical for TGEV infections. Microscopic examination of lungs reveals that PRCV causes a diffuse interstitial pneumonia (O'Toole et al., 1989; van Nieuwstadt and Pol, 1989; Cox et al., 1990) . PRCV infection is generally subclinical or accompanied by mild respiratory disease, and villous atrophy is not observed in the intestines. TGEV, on the other hand, multiplies primarily in the epithelial cells covering the tips of the villi in the small intestine, causing diarrhoea.",

However, TGEV possesses antigenic sites in its S peplomer protein which are absent in PRCV (Callebaut et al., 1988; Garwes et al., 1988; Laude et al., 1988; Sanchez et al., 1990; Simkins et al., 1992) .

The infection shows a seasonal pattern, infecting farms particularly during winter and early spring (Pensaert and Cox, 1989; Pensaert at al., 1993) . However, PRCV may persist on a farm all the year round by regular infection of newly weaned pigs (Pensaert at al., 1993) . At present, the virus is enzootic in the European swine population. For instance, PRCV-induced antibodies were detected in sera from 95% of the farms in Belgium (Pensaert et al., 1993) . This paper reports the results of a cross-sectional epidemiological study of 408 Danish swine herds that were all surveyed within 12 months after the initial introduction of PRCV into Denmark. The crude epidemiological results of the study were presented in a preliminary analysis by Henningsen et al. ( 1989) . The objective of the present study was, by the use of multivariable techniques, to identify risk factors that may be associated with herdlevel PRCV seropositivity.",

To detect a difference in PRCV prevalence from 0.6 in exposed herds to 0.4 in non-exposed herds a sample of 100 exposed herds is needed (given a Type I error at 0.05 and a Type II error at 0.2, Martin et al., 1987) . In order to detect differences of this magnitude for potential risk factors with high-to-moderate occurrence, a sample size of (approximately) 400 herds was set. The herds actually investigated (n =408) were all volunteers selected by the 22 practising veterinarians in the two regions. The veterinarians were instructed to choose representative farms in their practice. The reference population of the two regions comprised 8295 herds, with an estimated total of 1 600 000 pigs (Landbrugsstatistik, 1986) . All participating farms were visited once by their practising veterinarian between 24 May 1985 and 19 June 1986. During the visit, blood samples were collected and data on potential risk factors were obtained by questionnaire. Accordingly, both the producer and the interviewer were unaware of the PRCV serological status of the farm at the time of the interview.",

Serum was examined in a virusneutralization test at a dilution of l/5 (mean of duplicate determinations) in a microtitre system against 100 TCIDSO of FS 216/64 TGE-virus, using secondary porcine thyroid cells (Witte, 1971) . As an indication of the test specificity, we found no positive reactions in 4396 serum samples from adult pigs tested prior to 1978. Tests were read after 3 days of incubation, and assigned as positive or negative. Because this test is not specific for PRCV it cannot normally be used to distinguish PRCV from TGEV. However, TGEV has never been diagnosed in Danish swine herds, either clinically, virologically or (using the aforementioned differentiating test) serologically, and therefore, seropositivity was defined as evidence of PRCV infection. A herd was considered infected when at least one pig tested positive for PRCV.",

An 'epidemiological corridor' probably exists between the north of Germany and the south of the Jutland peninsula. Such long-distance airborne virus transmission has also been suggested for Aujeszky's disease virus (Christensen et al., 1990) . The type of floor where pigs were raised influenced the odds of the herd being seropositive. This result cannot be related to the introduction of PRCV into the herd, However, slatted floors mlay be considered to be a stress factor which might decrease pigs resistance to respiratory diseases. Similar results were found in studies of pneumonia (Straw, 1986) . Purchase of pigs within the past 6 weeks appeared more frequently in seropositive than in seronegative herds. Thus, moving infected pigs may have contributed to the spread of PRCV. Table 3 A cross-sectional study of PRCV in Danish swine herds (1985) (1986) . Results of a logistic regression model including 316 herds from which data on all variables (listed in The detrimental effect of increasing herd size on the incidence and prevalence of swine respiratory disease has frequently been reported (Willeberg et al., 1994) . The theoretical curvilinear relationships between herd size and the odds of contracting the disease could also be demonstrated in this study by the use of In (HPU) or In (number of pigs) as a herd size measure. The results are in accordance with previous studies of other epizootics with airborne transmission, as demonstrated for Aujeszky's disease (pseudorabies) in Denmark in 1987 to 1988 (Christensen et al., 1990) . In relation to geographical location and presence or absence of a slurry system, herd size (ln( HPU) ) acted primarily as an effect-modifier rather than a confounding variable (Table 3) . Accordingly, further studies are necessary to clarify the herd-size effect. In this case, the geographical density of pigs may be an important Table 5 A cross-sectional study of PRCV in Danish swine herds (1985) (1986) .",

Results from a sub-set of 125 swine herds with an identified seropositive neighbouring swine herd (logistic multiple regression) aspect, since association between herd density and PRCV infection has previously been reported (Pensaert et al., 1993) . Indeed, there was a significant difference between pig density in the sampled area in the Jutland peninsula (430 pigs km-*) and on the island of Funen (230 pigs km-*) (Landbrugsstatistik, 1987 ). Among the above-mentioned risk factors, an increasing herd size and location in the Jutland peninsula support the hypothesis of airborne transmission of PRCV. Also, there was no difference in the prevalence of PRCV between SPFIMS herds and conventional herds, so that rigorous herd security did not seem to protect against PRCV. A hypothesis of airborne transmission was additionally supported by the analysis of herds with an identified neighbouring swine herd, by the finding that the PRCV serological status of neighbouring herds was related, and by the result that closeness of a seropositive herd increased the risk significantly ( Table 5 ). The size of the neighbouring infected herd did not appear to be significantly associated with the risk, but p for ln(HPU) of the outcome herd was close to 1. This has been shown by Willeberg et al. ( 1994) to be the case for infectious diseases at the herd level, provided that the probability of the herd becoming infected (P) is related to the probability of one or more animals becoming infected by the equation P = 1 -( 1 -p)\", where 17 is the probability of one animal becoming infected and n is the number of animals in the herd.",
