Methods: The study follows a descriptive, cross-sectional design and uses a self-reported questionnaire. Emergency medical technicians, amounting to 1,020 in all, currently working in firefighting organizations from four South Korean cities (Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, and Ulsan) participated in the study. Results: Disaster risk perception, self-efficacy for disaster, participation experience in disaster education/ training, and personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness predicted the disaster response competency of emergency medical technicians in South Korea. Conclusion: There is a need for an antidisaster program to enhance the disaster risk perception, selfefficacy, personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness, and the disaster education/ training participation rate toward enhancing disaster response competency of emergency medical technicians in South Korea.",

Disasters can occur regardless of time or place and typically not only cause severe injuries to people and damage infrastructure but also pose a danger to poorly maintained surroundings that require prompt emergency care with insufficient resources. South Korea is a divided country and thus holds the potential for military conflict. Therefore, disaster response competency of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) as the professional manpower within firefighting organizations to handle disasters is extremely important and should be strengthened [2] .",

Therefore, the South Korean government has periodically conducted a complete emergency drill as part of its new nationwide antidisaster program, involving relevant agencies such as public health centers, schools, the military, the police, and hospitals in conjunction with firefighting organizations. However, such antidisaster drills do not comprehensively reflect the nature of disasters and are not subject to timely evaluations [3] . If EMTs fail to act as first responders in the disaster response phase, secondary disasters may occur. Hence, it is necessary to implement practical measures reflecting the reality to build up and understand factors that strengthen the disaster response competency, which is the specialized knowledge and skills associated with disasters as the capacity required for EMTs to minimize damage to the victim [4, 5] .",

One unclear item was excluded from the pilot test (n \u00bc 20), and finally, the questionnaire was compiled. It comprised three items: (a) If I obtain any information on the disaster through mass media (television, radio, SNS or Social Network Services, Internet news, etc.), I will follow disaster safety guidelines in my daily life; (b) If I attend disaster education/training, I can escape a disaster scene without panicking; and (c) If I know the disaster recovery process at the national level, I can overcome with national support quickly even if I become a disaster victim.

Being located in Ulsan is likely a significant predictor because earthquakes occur more frequently in Ulsan region when compared with Busan, Daegu, and Daejeon regions [18] . The results of regression analysis including the addition of personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness, disaster risk perception, and self-efficacy for disaster in the Model 1 equation verified that participation experience in disaster education/training (at least once and twice or more times annually), personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness, disaster risk perception, and self-efficacy are significant predictors of disaster response competency of EMTs. Previous studies [6e11] have reported that the high-risk perception group, the high self-efficacy group for disaster, the group that had prior experience of a disaster, and the group with prior enrollment in a disaster-related training had increased likelihoods of engaging in disaster preparedness behaviors. Depending on the person, the level of these variables will vary. The learning effect also depends on the individual's experiences and characteristics. Therefore, to enhance the significant predictors of disaster response competency of EMTs, antidisaster programs need to be established based on the current level and characteristics of disaster education/training, personal disaster preparedness, disaster risk perception, and self-efficacy of EMTs for disaster.",

[19] , but slightly lower than that of the study by Uhm and Oh [23] . The mean score of workplace preparedness was higher than that of household preparedness, which is consistent with the findings of Uhm and Oh [23] . These may be related to the impact of the guideline on EMTs [20] as a regulation of firefighting organizations in South Korea. Although EMTs should work as rescuers in real-world disaster events, family safety of EMTs is also important because their families can also be affected by disasters [25] . Therefore, household preparedness is as important as workplace preparedness. Previous studies have reported that individuals consider disaster preparedness more seriously after receiving education/training or watching relevant advertisements [26, 27] . Hence, a national-level publicity campaign is required to encourage people to actively participate in personal disaster preparedness activities.",

Second, it is necessary to investigate the core features of disaster response for the health care of community residents in disasters, with the help of scholars specializing in emergency medical services and nursing. Third, because this study identified factors influencing the disaster response competency of EMTs, a pathway analysis should be conducted to clarify these influential factors and their effects. Our findings provide a baseline for understanding the disaster response competency of EMTs, whose duty is to protect people's lives and ensure their safety in South Korea. Our study is particularly significant because it considers psychological variables such as self-efficacy for disaster and disaster risk perception, as well as demographic and disasterrelated characteristics, and personal disaster preparedness.",

We also observed that disaster risk perception, self-efficacy for disaster, personal disaster (household and workplace) preparedness, and disaster education/training (once or more times annually) were influential variables in predicting disaster response competency. Because South Korea is a potentially disaster-prone country geopolitically, insufficient disaster response competency of EMTs can cause nationwide disasters. Therefore, an antidisaster program that focuses on increasing these factors is needed. Future research should identify methods to increase disaster risk perception, personal disaster preparedness, and self-efficacy for disaster as well as methods for enhancing the disaster education/training participation rate.
