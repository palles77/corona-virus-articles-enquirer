Although subject to the same regulations as other biological products, vaccines are inherently more difficult to develop, characterize, and manufacture than most pharmaceutical products. Current US-licensed vaccines are listed in Tables 73-1 and 73-2 .",

Use of vaccines has resulted in the prevention of millions of deaths and cases of morbidity annually caused by infectious diseases around the world. Because vaccines are so widely used globally, it is imperative that these products be as safe and effective as current technology will permit. The assessment, licensure, control, and surveillance of vaccines are major challenges for national regulatory authorities (NRAs), who are confronted by a steadily increasing number of novel products, complex quality concerns, and new technical issues arising from rapid scientific advances. Furthermore, with emerging global markets, the volume of vaccines crossing international borders continues to increase, and it is critical that regulatory knowledge of and experience with vaccines be shared, and that approaches to their control be harmonized to the greatest extent possible.",

Developed countries have established governmental regulatory agencies to review and determine the safety and effectiveness of vaccines; however, even today, many developing countries do not have established NRAs. Although not an NRA, the World Health Organization (WHO) uses a consultative approach involving its Expert Committee on Biological Standardization and Biologicals Unit to develop regulatory criteria and identify and consolidate current consensus opinions on key regulatory issues. WHO also communicates to national authorities and manufacturers through guidance documents addressing both general issues and specific products. * Through this mechanism, NRAs are informed of the scientific background needed to assess critical issues, and are advised on which regulatory approaches and methodologies have been found to be optimal for ensuring the global supply of uniformly safe and effective vaccines of the highest quality. 3 The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the national regulatory authority in the United States charged with ensuring the safety, purity, and effectiveness of vaccines in the United States. The review of vaccine applications occurs among CBER's Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality, and Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology. The development of vaccines is an intricate process, and every step in the life cycle from testing of materials used for production to postlicensure lot-release testing is subject to stringent oversight by CBER. After licensure, CBER continues to oversee the production and performance of vaccines to ensure their continued safety and efficacy.",

Other important collaborators in the US government involved in vaccine activities include the US Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Consistent with the goal of harmonization, the Enterprise and Industry Directorate-General (DG Enterprise) of the European Commission, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the FDA concluded confidentiality arrangements on 12 September 2003 covering medicinal products, including vaccines that are subject to evaluation or authorization under the centralized procedure in Europe. The confidentiality arrangements allow the EMA of the European Commission and the FDA in the United States to exchange information as part of their regulatory processes. The types of information covered by the arrangements include legal and regulatory issues, scientific advice, orphan drug designation, inspection reports, marketing authorization procedures, and postmarketing surveillance. These confidentiality arrangements were reviewed at a meeting between the DG Enterprise, the EMA, and the FDA in Brussels in March 2006. The review resulted in an agreement to intensify the existing cooperation in the area of medicinal products, bringing a focus to vaccines (including preparedness for pandemic influenza), pediatric medicines, medicines for rare diseases (\"orphans\"), oncology, and pharmacogenomics. The FDA has confidentiality agreements with NRAs in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Belgium, Canada, the Council of Europe, the European Commission (DG SANCO), Denmark (drugs), Italy (drugs), the Netherlands, France, Germany, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and WHO (although not an NRA).

The US Congress enacted the 1902 Biologics Control Act, which contained the initial concepts used for the regulation of biologics, after a major tragedy occurred in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1901 . Twenty children became ill and 14 died after receiving an equine-derived diphtheria antitoxin contaminated with tetanus toxin. It was discovered that the diphtheria antitoxin had been prepared from horse serum contaminated with tetanus bacilli. 5 This event stimulated legislation to regulate the sale of biologicals. On July 1, 1902, the Biologics Control Act was signed into law. It prohibited transportation or sale of biologicals unless the manufacturer possessed an establishment and product license. During consideration of this legislation, the following points were recognized: 6 \u2022 There could be no assurance of purity if control was limited to inspections and tests of the final products, both because of the limitations of testing techniques and because such tests would need to include all materials, as the products varied with the different animals used in production. Therefore, an effective control would also need to include control of the manufacturing establishments. \u2022 The products in question were generally administered directly into the circulatory system or the digestive tract, and there were few remedial measures available if the drugs were impure. \u2022 The control of potency was particularly important because, as was noted in the proceedings that led to the development of the legislation, if the first dose proves worthless, the loss of time to produce the product may cost the patient his or her life.",

The history of vaccine control organizations in developed nations has been one of increasing size and complexity. A chronology of the development of the US Biologicals Control Authority is summarized in Table 73 -3 and outlined in Figure 73 -1 . The US Congress enacted another significant law in 1902 that expanded the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service. This led to the creation of the first federal agency in which public health issues could be coordinated. The Hygienic Laboratory, the principal research unit of the service, was located in Washington, DC. Within this organization, the Biological Control Service assumed responsibility for the regulation of three products: smallpox vaccine, tetanus antitoxin, and diphtheria antitoxin. These products were defined as biologicals. In 1930, the Hygienic Laboratory was reorganized, expanded, and renamed the National Institutes of Health.",

In 1944 Congress recodified the 1902 Biologics Control Act as part of the US Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) of 1944. The PHS Act incorporated the 1902 Biologics Control Act into Section 351 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262). 7 As with the 1902 Act, the 1944 PHS Act focused primarily on extensive control over manufacturing methods to ensure purity and safety, and maintained the licensure system for the manufacturing facility and product. Unique to the 1944 PHS Act was Congress's explicit addition of the requirement that biologics manufacturers demonstrate potency as a measure of clinical usefulness. A 1970 amendment added vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, (or) allergenic products to the statutory list. Under the original act, government inspectors were authorized to inspect manufacturing establishments and to determine whether products were correctly labeled with the name of the product; the name, address, and license number of the manufacturer; and the expiration date of the product, and to determine the manner in which the product was prepared. Section 352 of the Act also permitted the PHS to manufacture biological products should the need arise (eg, if the product could not be obtained from already licensed establishments). 8 This authority has not been used to date.",

            "text": "Throughout the life of the PHS Act of 1944, Congress vested the administrative authority for regulation of biologics in several separate agencies. In 1948, the Biologics Control Laboratory joined the NIH Division of Infectious Diseases and Division of Tropical Diseases to form the National Microbiological Institute (later renamed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases). Administrative authority for regulation of biologics was originally granted to the National Microbiological Institute. The need for strengthening and expanding control of biologicals became evident in 1955. By this time, many biologicals (blood products as well as vaccines) had been licensed, including inactivated poliovirus vaccine prepared in monkey kidney cell cultures. Unfortunately, when several batches of the vaccine were used for immunization, a number of children developed poliomyelitis. The formaldehyde inactivation and safety test procedures employed were inadequate. It was determined in retrospect that 7 of 17 batches could be shown to contain living poliovirus. A later review indicated that the incompletely inactivated vaccine had caused poliomyelitis in 79 vaccine recipients, 105 family contacts, and 20 community contacts. 9 As a result of this much-publicized \"Cutter incident\" (Cutter was the manufacturer of the vaccine), administrative authority for the regulation of biologicals was transferred by Congress to the Division of Biologics Standards (DBS), a newly created division within the NIH. Prior to 1972, regulation of biologicals under the NIH had focused primarily on the PHS Act of 1944 and its requirements for safety, purity, and potency. Subsequently, Congress adopted the Consumer Safety Act of 1972, which transferred regulatory authority for the administration of the 1944 PHS Act from the NIH to the FDA. In 1972, the DBS, which was charged with administering and enforcing modernize the regulation of biologics by synchronizing their review process with that of drugs and eliminating the requirement for an establishment license for biologics. Expedited approval mechanisms for life-threatening conditions were authorized under FDAMA as well. 10 The FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA) of 2007 includes 11 titles that added many new provisions to the FD&C Act. This Act reauthorized and amended several drug and medical device provisions, and it provided the FDA with additional responsibilities and new authorities. 11 PDUFA IV was reauthorized under FDAAA and outlines the 5-year review performance goals for drug and biologics license applications, supplements and resubmissions, meeting management goals, clinical holds, major dispute resolution, special protocol question assessment and agreement, electronic applications and submissions, discipline review, and complete response letters. The provisions of FDAAA that have had a significant impact on the regulations of vaccines and the review process are contained in Title IV, the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 (PREA) and Title IX, Enhanced Authorities Regarding Postmarket Safety of Drugs. Title IX provides the FDA with new funding to collect, develop, and review safety information, and to develop adverse event surveillance systems and analytic tools, and Title IV expands pediatric research with the reauthorization of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act. Collectively, these authorities have afforded CBER the authority to accelerate and improve the review process.",

The clinical development of a new drug in the United States usually begins with a sponsor approaching the FDA for permission to conduct a clinical study with an investigational product through submission of an IND application form.* These requirements can be found in the IND regulations. 13 Sponsors are encouraged to request a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss preclinical studies, clinical study design, and data requirements that require resolution before the initiation of clinical trials. Prior to initiating phase 1 clinical trials sponsors should discuss, and reach an agreement on the preclinical studies prior to or during the pre-IND meeting with the FDA. Considerations for these studies are evaluated on a product-specific basis and requirements may differ depending on the type of vaccine, its manufacturing process, and mechanism of action. The preclinical toxicity study should be adequate to identify and characterize potential toxic effects of a vaccine in order to conclude that it is reasonably safe to proceed to clinical investigation. If the target population of the vaccine includes pregnant women and women of childbearing potential, developmental toxicity studies may be considered. Adequate information should be provided to FDA on the clinical plan, and protocols should be submitted for CBER review prior to initiation of animal studies.

There are generally three separate phases in the clinical evaluation of experimental biologicals at the premarketing stage ( Figure 73 -2). These phases may overlap, and the clinical testing may be highly iterative because multiple phase 1 or 2 trials may be performed as new data are obtained. Phase 1 trials are intended primarily to provide a preliminary evaluation of safety and immunogenicity. These trials are typically conducted in a small number (eg, 20 to 80) of closely monitored adult volunteers. If the ultimate target population for the vaccine is infants or young children, as is commonly the case, the product is then usually evaluated in a stepwise progression from older to younger age groups, down into the first year of life. It is not always simple to distinguish between phase 1 and phase 2 studies; however, in general, phase 2 studies are larger, perhaps involving up to several hundred participants. Phase 2 studies are often randomized and well controlled, and they provide further information on safety and immunogenicity. Dosage-ranging studies are included in phase 2 clinical development. In some cases, phase 2 studies provide preliminary data on the vaccine's activity against the infectious disease of interest. Intermediate clinical studies may be done after phase 2 that are not considered efficacy studies. These studies are referred to as socalled phase 2b studies (there is no regulatory definition for phase 2b), and are designed to assist in determining whether to move a candidate vaccine into a larger phase 3 trial. Phase 2b studies *Sponsors may be individual physicians, a university, a hospital, or a commercial firm, as well as government agencies, such as one of the institutes of the NIH, the CDC, or the DOD. are generally smaller than the pivotal phase 3 trial, and are not designed to have the statistical power required for a phase 3 study. If the data from the phase 2b study are encouraging, a phase 3 efficacy study is still required to support licensure of the candidate vaccine. Phase 2b studies may increase the clinical development time for a vaccine; however, phase 2b studies may be useful for evaluating and screening different vaccine candidates. Phase 2b studies have been used to evaluate candidate HIV vaccines, and were done prior to the large phase 3 efficacy trials for the human papillomavirus vaccines. Phase 3 studies are large-scale trials involving more extensive testing to provide a more thorough assessment of safety as well as a definite assessment of efficacy; moreover, these studies often include the pivotal efficacy trials as well as expanded safety studies. The general considerations for clinical studies to support licensure of a vaccine include demonstrations of safety and efficacy (immunogenicity may be sufficient in some cases) and evaluation of simultaneous administration with other licensed vaccines. Ideally, efficacy is demonstrated in randomized, double-blind, wellcontrolled trials. The endpoints will be product specific, and they may be clinical disease endpoints or immune response endpoints if efficacy against clinical disease has been previously established and there are immune correlates or surrogates of that protection. In recent years, because of interconnected variables such as study design and the incidence of the disease to be prevented, efficacy trials for various vaccines have involved a broad range in the number of study participants, from thousands to tens of thousands. For example, clinical disease endpoint studies that are designed to demonstrate that a new vaccine is not inferior to an already existing product of the same type generally require larger numbers than those in which a new vaccine can be compared with a control that has no activity against the clinical disease.",

These studies are known as bridging studies. In other words, immunogenicity data may be used to bridge to existing clinical endpoint efficacy data. The 1998 FDA Guidance for Industry: Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness recommends two efficacy trials as the standard; however, one trial may be adequate if the results are compelling, which is often the case for vaccine clinical endpoint efficacy trials (eg, robust-data, multicenter trials with a high level of efficacy). 14 Safety is one of the most important considerations when evaluating new vaccines and modifications to currently licensed vaccines. The initial responsibility for determining vaccine safety starts with clinical investigators and vaccine manufacturers. The FDA is responsible for ensuring that clinical trials are done under good clinical practices, a requirement essential for the evaluation of safety data intended to support a license application. In general, when evaluating safety, one must compare the risk of the vaccine-preventable disease with the risk of the adverse events potentially associated with the vaccine, and these may change over time. As an example, the reported association between Rotashield (rotavirus vaccine, live, oral, tetravalent, manufactured by Wyeth) and intussusception resulted in the additional requirement for the evaluation of the safety of RotaTeq (live, oral pentavalent human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine, manufactured by Merck) with respect to intussusception. This clinical trial enrolled over 70,000 infants divided equally between RotaTeq and placebo. The primary safety hypothesis was that the oral RotaTeq would not increase the risk of intussusception relative to placebo within 42 days of any dose. The intended target population should also be taken into consideration in assessing the adequacy of the safety database. For routinely administered childhood vaccines in the United States, the target population would be the birth cohort in the United States (approximately 4 million/year). This is generally a healthy population, and a government body (eg, states or local governments) may mandate vaccination. Common reactions can be studied adequately in hundreds of individuals, but many thousands will be required to define low-incidence adverse reactions.",

The studies need to be designed in such a way that statistical methods can be applied to their evaluation. Safety studies may be unblinded if the number of injections, route of administration, or schedule differs between groups, in particular when infants and young children are involved. Phase 2 safety studies should provide data on common local and systemic reactions to the study vaccine. Phase 2 clinical development should also include immunogenicity and preliminary safety data on the concurrent administration of the study vaccine with other vaccines, if relevant. Phase 3 safety studies are designed to evaluate less common reactions, may be unequally randomized, and may have a simplified trial design for assessing less common adverse events in large trials. If a vaccine is recommended on the same schedule as other routinely recommended vaccines, safety and immunogenicity data should be obtained in prelicensure studies to support simultaneous administration.",

The major issues observed during inspections can be categorized in three major areas: (1) process-related issues, (2) quality unit-related issues, and (3) facility-and production environment-related issues. Some examples of process validation issues include lack of documentation of time limits for major steps in the production process, lack of validation of rework or reprocessing steps in the manufacturing process, and lack of data to support in-process specifications. Quality unit-related issues include the appropriate reporting of out-ofspecification results and process deviations (including adequate investigations into causes), appropriate documentation of product release, and adequate training of personnel. Facility and production monitoring concerns include controlling production environments by appropriately monitoring heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system performance and microbial quality (eg, pressure differentials, appropriate sampling sites, frequency of sampling).

Section 901 of FDAAA 2007 also created new Sections 505-1 and 505(o)(4) of the FD&C Act, authorizing the FDA, under certain circumstances, to require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and safety-related labeling changes, respectively. Before FDAAA 2007, the FDA used the term postmarketing commitment (PMC) to refer to studies to which manufacturers committed as a condition of approval of the product. For vaccines, these studies were usually intended to further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a product. These PMCs were agreed on by FDA and the applicant before licensure. Before FDAAA 2007, FDA required postmarketing studies in the following situations: (1) for accelerated approvals for products approved under 505(b) of the FD&C Act or under Section 351 of the PHS Act that require postmarketing studies to demonstrate clinical benefit, (2) for deferred pediatric studies, when studies are required under PREA, and (3) for animal efficacy rule approvals, when studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy in humans are required at the time of use. Under new Section 505(o) of the FD&C Act, the FDA is authorized to also require postmarketing studies or clinical trials at the time of approval or after approval if the FDA becomes aware of new safety information. Section 505(o)(3)(B) states that postmarketing studies and clinical trials may be required to (1) assess a known serious risk related to the use of the drug involved, (2) assess signals of serious risk related to the use of the drug, and (3) identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk and when the adverse event reporting system is not adequate. The FDA has defined a clinical trial as any prospective investigation in which the sponsor or investigator determines the method of assigning treatment or other intervention to one or more human subjects. A study is all other investigations, such as investigations using humans that are not clinical trials as just defined (eg, observational epidemiologic studies), animal studies, and laboratory experiments. The FDA has issued guidance for industry that describes the type of studies and clinical trials that are required (postmarketing requirement [PMR] ) under the FDAAA 2007, and those that will remain agreed-on commitments (PMC). A PMR describes all required postmarketing studies or clinical trials including those required under accelerated approval, PREA, the animal rule, and FDAAA. Examples of required studies are pharmacoepidemiologic studies designed to assess a serious risk, trials with a primary safety endpoint, preclinical studies investigating specific end-organ toxicities, and pharmacokinetic studies in the indicated population at potential risk for high drug exposure that could result in toxicity. Studies that generally would not be considered required postmarketing studies or clinical trials are agreed-on studies (PMC) and include biologic quality studies (such as manufacturing, stability, and immunogenicity studies that do not have a primary safety endpoint), trials in which the primary endpoint is related to further defining efficacy, and pharmacoepidemiologic studies designed to examine the natural history of disease or background rates for adverse events.",

            "text": "Vaccines are tested during the prelicensure as well as the postlicensure phase. Testing procedures are developed from a combination of the understanding of past adverse experiences and the best current knowledge regarding the potential for new ones. From past experience, a few highly important issues must continue to receive special attention. For inactivated vaccines, a clear understanding of the kinetics of inactivation is key; this was the lesson of the Cutter incident mentioned previously. For live vaccines, the agent must be at a stable level of attenuation; it must not become overattenuated or revert to virulence. The Brazilian experience, in which yellow fever vaccine appeared to revert to neurovirulence after multiple passages, demonstrated the need for a seed lot system in which the number of passages from the parent virus to the passage level used as vaccine is restricted. 19 All vaccines require an extensive search for extraneous contaminants. The experience in which human serum was used as a stabilizer for yellow fever vaccine and caused hundreds of cases of long-incubation hepatitis virus infection underscored this need. 20 The FDA requires that cell substrates and vaccine viral seeds used in production be appropriately selected and tested to ensure that they do not introduce any unintended risks. The current cell substrates used to manufacture licensed vaccines are primary avian or monkey cells, diploid cells, one continuous cell line, Vero, as well as yeast and insect cells. Refer to Table 73-6 for a list of cell substrates in current US licensed vaccines. In 2010, the FDA published the final guidance, Characterization and Qualification of Cell Substrates and Other Biological Starting Materials Used in the Production of Viral Vaccines for the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases. This guidance document provides important advice for manufacturers on using cell cultures to produce vaccines against infectious diseases and to use modern technologies to ensure that they meet the highest safety expectations. Selection of a cell substrate influences the safety and purity of the biological product manufactured in it. Cell substrates are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but characterization of any cell substrate used for the development and manufacture of a vaccine should address certain general issues that might affect the safety and purity of vaccine products manufactured in them. Examples of such issues include karyotype and tumorigenic phenotype of the cell substrate, the identity and genetic stability of the cell substrate and virus seeds, and the requirement that the vaccine be free of extraneous infectious microorganisms and potential oncogenic agents. Historically, only primary cells were used widely for viral vaccine production, and, although primary cells are still used in the manufacture of some viral vaccines, major concerns have arisen over the passage of adventitious agents from primary cells into the product and thus, potentially, into vaccine recipients. In the early 1960s, exogenous and endogenous contamination of primary monkey kidney cells (PMKCs) with simian virus 40, and chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) with avian leukosis virus were reported. PMKCs and CEFs are still used in the production of viral vaccines, but these cells are required to be well characterized and extensively tested prior to use. Issues related to cell substrates have been discussed in a variety of forums. 21, 22 Oncogenicity is defined as the process by which agents immortalize cells and endow them with the capacity to form tumors. The demonstration that viruses can be oncogenic in mammalian hosts has produced an intense focus on cell-culture substrate safety as well. If a vaccine is manufactured in a cell substrate that is derived from a tumor, or that has developed a tumorigenic phenotype through an unknown mechanism, it could carry a higher theoretical risk of containing oncogenic substances. It is important to characterize the cell substrate to ensure that it does not contain potentially oncogenic components that could contaminate the final product.",

On this account, attention has been centered on the safety of substances derived from mammalian sources, such as media components used for nurturing cell cultures and gelatins used as stabilizers. 23 Bovine-derived materials have traditionally been used in the manufacture of many biological products, including vaccines. Since BSE was first recognized in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, the FDA has been concerned about eliminating any potential for contamination of biological products with the BSE agent. This concern was heightened by the appearance of vCJD in the United Kingdom in 1996. To minimize the possibility of contamination in such products, the FDA, in 1993 and again in 1996, requested that manufacturers not use materials derived from cattle that were born, raised, or slaughtered in countries where BSE is known to exist. The FDA referred manufacturers to the listing of such countries maintained by the US Department of Agriculture (www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/animals/ani-mal_import/animal_imports_bse.shtml). 24 More information on vaccines and the sourcing of bovine-derived raw materials can be found on CBER's Web site (www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ SafetyAvailability/ucm111476.htm).",

This issue has been approached by careful study of the constructs used and the stability of these constructs and by attempts to reduce extraneous DNA content to levels that are regarded as extremely unlikely to produce an adverse genetic event. [25] [26] [27] Residual DNA for continuous nontumorigenic cells, such as low-passage Vero cells, should be limited to less than 10 ng/dose for parenteral inoculation and less than 100 \u03bcg/dose for oral vaccines. Cells with tumorigenic phenotypes or other characteristics that give rise to special concerns may require more stringent limitation of residual DNA quantities to ensure product safety. 28 Preapproval test development may be conducted entirely by the sponsor or with involvement of the regulatory agency as well. CBER is particularly likely to become involved if the product is new or represents a novel problem in testing. This involvement, bolstered by laboratory-based capability, has been one of the strengths of the vaccine regulatory program in the United States. As the product moves forward in the regulatory process, the sponsor develops the testing program in greater detail.

A potency test is applied to each product to demonstrate that the product confers protective immunity. The type of test varies depending on the product and is commonly based on studies of immunogenicity or protection from virulent challenge in laboratory animals. However, other in vitro tests can be involved, including virus titration (eg, live vaccines such as polio, measles, mumps, and rubella), antigen content (eg, influenza and inactivated poliovirus vaccines), and biochemical and biophysical measurements (eg, meningococcal conjugate vaccines). Specialized immunological assays are required in the clinical development of vaccines to ascertain the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Ideally, the immune responses measured by these assays should correlate with protection against disease. This is true for many of the currently licensed vaccines; however, for some licensed vaccines, and new vaccines in development it is not always clear which immune response correlates with protection. Standardization of immunogenicity assays across studies, laboratories, and across similar products present challenges, but are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines.",

During the prelicensing phase, research testing results are evaluated to determine which tests under development need to be applied to every batch of product and which do not require such repetition. For example, with hepatitis B vaccines made using recombinant DNA technology, initial evidence for identity, purity, and genetic stability of the protein product was provided by physicochemical, immunologic, and molecular biological test methods. Once the consistency levels of the results of all tests are validated for multiple lots produced during the IND application and productlicensing phases, a determination is made to routinely perform some of these tests, which will be evaluated to ensure the consistent quality of the final product in each lot. The regulation of biologicals includes requirements for testing of licensed products. Certain of these requirements are generally applicable to all products, whereas others are tailored to the specific vaccine. The tests, generally applicable to all products, include those for bacterial and fungal sterility , general safety, purity, identity, suitability of constituent materials, and potency. Sterility testing is performed on both bulk and final container material, using media and conditions of incubation described in the regulations. In addition, cell culture-derived vaccines must be tested for mycoplasmas. The general safety test usually is performed by intraperitoneal inoculation of final container material into mice and guinea pigs to detect the possible presence of gross extraneous contaminants that may have been introduced during the manufacture or filling process. Tests for purity are designed to determine that the product is free of extraneous material, except that which is unavoidable in the manufacturing process described in the approved license application, and they may include tests for residual moisture and pyrogenic substances. Final container material must be identified by a test specific for each product (eg, neutralization of each of the components of live measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine with specific antisera).

Since that time, the number of combinations has grown steadily, now including the individual types of live and inactivated poliovirus vaccines; several combinations of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines; combinations of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) or hepatitis B vaccines; trivalent influenza vaccines; quadrivalent influenza vaccine; pneumococcal vaccines with multiple serotypes; the combination of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines; and the combination of DTaP, inactivated poliovirus, and hepatitis B vaccines. The current success in developing new vaccine products administered in the first years of life has complicated vaccine schedules and has put special pressure on the desire for additional combinations. Products for which this approach might be an option in the future include combinations of killed antigens already in use (eg, DTaP, Haemophilus type b conjugate, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate, hepatitis A and B, and the poliovirus vaccines). Live viral vaccines routinely recommended early in life are measlesmumps-rubella and varicella, and licensure of a combination of these live virus vaccines is now available as ProQuad manufactured by Merck. The manufacturing process and preclinical and clinical studies performed before licensure of a new combination vaccine are all intensively scrutinized during product development. Vaccines are complex mixtures that contain not only viral or bacterial antigens but also other components such as preservatives, adjuvants, stabilizers (eg, gelatin and sorbitol), and buffers and salts. Of particular concern is the compatibility of these components in the final combination. A combination vaccine may fail because of manufacturing issues such as the physicochemical interactions in the product, or biological interference among the combined attenuated immunizing agents, or immunologic interference, detected either in animal studies or during human clinical trials. 31 Preclinical immunogenicity studies may be very useful in determining the characteristics of antibody-induced responses (subclass, affinity, functionality, epitope recognition). Animal models may be helpful in comparing the responses to the combined product and the individual vaccines. Similarly, an appropriate challenge model can serve to bolster the human data collected later in development.",

Similarly, when one or more of the components incorporates an adjuvant, the combination could affect antigen binding. Some of the bound antigen could be lost, or a previously unbound antigen could become adsorbed. Commonly, combinations raise issues related to successful potency, purity, identity, and sterility testing and may require alternative assay strategies. When potency tests of individual components are already approved for use on licensed products, it may be necessary to demonstrate that these tests still produce valid information when applied to a new combination vaccine. 35 For example, vaccine components may have to be tested at an earlier bulk stage of manufacture rather than in the final container.

SV40 is relatively resistant to formalin inactivation and thus low levels of live SV40 remained present in lots of IPV. 43 The federal government required that new lots of IPV be manufactured free of SV40.",

This case arose in the mid 1990's when a highly sensitive PCR test called product enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assay was developed. The reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme is present in all retroviruses, so the presence of RT enzyme suggested that retroviruses could be present. In 1996, this test was used to demonstrate that previously undetectable quantities of reverse transcriptase were present in some vaccines produced in avian cells. 44 Studies by the FDA and the vaccine industry demonstrated that this endogenous avian retrovirus was a defective particle that does not induce productive infections in cell culture. FDA concluded that based on these results, along with the long safety record of vaccines produced in hen's eggs, the benefits of the vaccines outweighed any potential risk of the presence of endogenous avian retroviruses in the vaccines.",

A team of investigators used a novel metagenomic method consisting of viral particle purification, massively parallel pyrosequencing, and viral sequence similarity searches to search for adventitious viruses in eight live attenuated vaccines: oral polio virus vaccine, rubella virus vaccine, measles virus vaccine, yellow fever virus vaccine, varicella virus vaccine, two rotavirus vaccines, and measles/mumps/rubella vaccine. 45 DNA sequences originating from porcine circovirus-1 (PCV-1) were detected in two batches of GSK's live attenuated rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix\u00ae. PCV-1 is a small, circular virus composed of a single strand of DNA. PCV-1 is found commonly among pigs, but is not known to cause disease in pigs nor other animals, including humans.

The investigations at both GSK and FDA included studies designed to determine whether the PCV-1 DNA is particle associated, whether infectious PCV-1 virus is present in the vaccine, and whether PCV-1 is capable of replication in Vero cells or other mammalian cells, including human cell lines. At the time of the convening of the VRBPAC, the findings of PCV-1 and PCV-2 in RotaTeq\u00ae were too preliminary for discussion so the VRBPAC was asked to discuss the significance of the most recent findings of PCV-1 in Rotarix\u00ae vaccine, the implications of the data for continued use of Rotarix\u00ae, and the need for any additional experiments or data. Based on all of the available information and feedback from the VRBPAC, CBER concluded that the safety of rotavirus vaccines (Rotarix\u00ae and RotaTeq\u00ae) is supported by available data and the benefits of the vaccines, which are known, are substantial and outweigh any theoretical risk.

Implementing routine use of such methods has benefits as well as challenges and risks. Detection methods for adventitious agents continue to evolve and improve. New methods may have higher sensitivity and throughput. Novel viruses (not previously known) are frequently being discovered and could be present in existing or new cell substrates and biological products.

Novel vaccine approaches, such as recombinant vaccines, and novel adjuvants and delivery systems pose regulatory challenges for NRAs.

Once administrative responsibility for the regulation of biologicals transferred from the NIH to the FDA, the FDA announced its intention to require that all new biologicals satisfy the additional standards of safety and efficacy mandated in the Drug Amendments Act of 1962. This resulted in the transfer of the regulations pertaining to biologics from Part 73 of Chapter I of Title 42 (USC 262) to Chapter I of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In 1982, the Bureau of Biologics was renamed the Office of Biologics Research and Review (OBRR) and combined with the Office of Drugs Research and Review to form the Center for Drugs and Biologics. In 1987, the OBRR was separated and renamed the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.Although they are not directly related to safety and efficacy, the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992 and the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA) of 1997 have both had an impact on the regulation of vaccines. PDUFA allows the FDA to collect fees from manufacturers to fund the review process. FDAMA, among other things, included measures to History of the Food and Drug Law.
