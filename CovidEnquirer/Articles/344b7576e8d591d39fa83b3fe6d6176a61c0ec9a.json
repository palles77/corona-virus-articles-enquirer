Methods: The data of 8,648 clusters in the TB epidemiological investigation database between 2013 and 2016 were extracted and analyzed to evaluate the indicators and perform multilevel logistic regression (MLR) analyses to identify the factors affecting each indicator. Results: The rates of total LTBI diagnosis, need for treatment, treatment initiation, and treatment completion were 15.2%, 10.2%, 69.4%, and 76.6%, respectively. After adjusting for other factors on MLR, the probability of diagnosis and need for treatment of latent TB in contacts was higher in most types of facilities than in schools. Conversely, treatment completion rates in these facilities were lower. Notably, the correctional institutions showed the highest odds ratio (OR) relative to school for LTBI diagnosis (OR, 6.37) and need for treatment (OR, 4.49) and the lowest OR for treatment completion (OR, 0.10). Conclusion: This study provided evidence for the implementation of latent TB control policies in congregated settings.",

The symptoms on presentation include chronic cough, fever, and production of sputum, among others. According to the global tuberculosis report, 2017, approximately 1.6 million new cases of TB were reported worldwide in 2016, with approximately 1.67 million deaths. 1 Asymptomatic individuals who do not transmit the infection despite being infected with M. tuberculosis are considered to have latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). 1 It is estimated that 1 out of 3 adults are infected with latent TB in Korea. 2 About 10% of people infected with latent and include data on epidemic clusters, TB patients, their contacts (i.e., those who had been in contact with a patient for more than 1 day during the period of communicability), and information on patients with LTBI. Based on the four most recent years (2013-2016) of epidemiological investigations, data for 8,648 TB clusters (occurring in congregated settings) were available for the present study. The number of clusters and contacts analyzed by process are shown in Fig. 1 .",

This may be explained by the fact that a longer time is spent in communal living in schools, with longer contact times. In addition, schools have a better reporting system and accessibility to medical systems than other facilities. Epidemiological investigations for TB among congregated facilities in Korea were started in schools from 2013. Remarkably, the number of epidemiological investigations rapidly increased with age, beginning from when the first index case was aged > 13 years; this was probably due to the fact that this is a rapid period of growth in youths, and they spend longer times in high school. 6 As reported by Fox et al. 26 in 2013, contact investigation is known to be important for children, because unlike older age clusters, in congregated settings with many children, the risk of developing active TB is higher, and the response to the latent TB test is often unreliable; more controls are therefore required.",

In this study, correctional institutions showed the highest diagnosis rate and OR. In comparison to international studies, the LTBI rate of contacts in correctional institutions was higher in Korea than that reported in the United States (17%) 17 ; however, it was lower than that of Spain (45.5%) 18 and Brazil (49%-73%). 20 It may be speculated that the LTBI risk in correctional institutions was higher than of other facilities owing to the overpopulated setting and small rooms, in addition to medical accessibility issues. Correctional institutions in Korea accommodate 1,098.8 inmates on average in each institution, corresponding to the highest level in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. Furthermore, the accommodation rate is 121.8%, corresponding to the second largest in the OECD member countries. 33 In this study, medical institutions had higher rates of latent TB diagnosis, need for treatment, and treatment initiation than schools. However, the treatment completion rate was lower. This finding may be explained by the fact that medical institutions perform more tests and monitor treatment more strictly. The hospital-ward characteristics in Korea possibly had some impact. In 2017, there were a total of 154,753 wards, of which 99,523 (64.3%) were general wards accommodating at least four inpatients, indicating that a high proportion are dormitory-type wards, and 85.9% of the total 534,157 beds were in non-isolated wards. 35 The setting with the most bed supplies were the non-isolated wards; this was identified as the major cause of nosocomial infections during the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2015. 36 Although treatment of latent TB was initiated, considering the short hospitalization period of within 1 month, a relatively low treatment completion rate of latent TB indicated a poor post-discharge control. To date, there is no clear regulation for post-discharge control of latent TB patients. A system has been established to share the information about TB-infected soldiers after discharge with the corresponding community health center. In contrast, for patients with LTBI, there is no system that registers these patients after discharge in the corresponding community health center or the TB control information system. Thus, there is need to establish a system that provides continuous treatment for patients with LTBI after discharge, and the same is applicable to social welfare facilities, as well as the medical and other institutions that have admission and discharge processes.",

It could also be explained by the fact that unlike schools or correctional institutions, the guidelines for the management of infected cases in the workplace congregated settings were unclear leading greater difficulties in the management of infected individuals. Overall, these results show that unlike the case of active TB patients a system of management from initiation to completion of treatment has not been fully established for LTBI, despite the expansion in numbers of treatment subjects with latent TB. An additional system, which can monitor and manage the treatment process in patients with LTBI aged 35 years or older is also necessary.",

First, the database contained only the information of Korean individuals; non-Korean individuals were not included in the analysis. The number of new TB patients among foreigners has increased in recent years, while that of Koreans has tended to decrease, showing an opposite trend. 37 Follow-up studies should be performed among foreigners with TB, whose numbers seemed to be on an increase. Secondly, the characteristics (gender and age, among others) of contacts of TB patients were not considered. However, the present study primarily intended to investigate the characteristics of clusters including type of facility and effect of timing after considering the characteristics of the index case; therefore, characteristics of contacts were not a major issue. Since the age of the contacts was a characteristic of the cluster they belonged to, the range was relatively similar and its influence was considered minor. Future studies should be performed with individual units considering the characteristics of contacts. Thirdly, the characteristics of the sub-categories in the congregated settings were not considered in this study. Schools maybe classified into kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school, and college; other facilities also have sub-types. In previous studies, the highest number of contact cases in Korean schools was found in high schools. Kindergartens and daycare centers also showed high LTBI rates. 6 As for correctional institutions in the United States, prisons where they serve their terms, had a higher treatment completion rate than detention centers that held inmates temporarily. 17 Since the details supplied by the facilities were incomplete, the data in the present study did not completely reflect all sub-types of facilities. However, this study had a different goal and those variables were not considered. Further studies are necessary to evaluate individual facilities according to sub-types. Lastly, the jobs among the first index cases in congregated settings were not classified. School populations could be sub-categorized as students and teachers, and medical institutions could be sub-divided into patients and healthcare professionals (doctor and nurse). These characteristics are likely to vary. For instance, the index cases in a study had different types of occupations depending on school type 6 ; in another study, healthcare professionals had a higher risk of LTBI due to contact with patients. 13 However, the analysis in the present study was based on various types of facilities. Therefore, they were not sub-divided to ensure consistency in the analysis.",

The setting in which inmates stay, living together in small rooms with short periods of outdoor activities, seemed to enhance TB transmission. In 2015, 87 doctors working in correctional institutions were in charge of 54,581 prisoners, and one doctor treated about 200 prisoners every day. 34 Under such circumstances, there could be delayed identification of prisoners infected with active TB, thus the possibility of transmission to contacts increases.",
