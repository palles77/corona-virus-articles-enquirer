            "text": "Genetic background of carbapenem and metronidazole resistance: detection of genes and mechanisms of expression M.E. Hedberg (Stockholm, S) Antimicrobial resistance is increasingly common among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, especially for the Bacteroides fragilis group. At present resistance has been described in this group of bacteria to almost all of the regularly used antianaerobic agents. Carbapenems and 5-nitroimidazoles are two of the most active antimicrobial agents against the B. fragilis group, but isolates resistant to these drugs seem to appear more frequently, although they still are quite rare. Metronidazole is often used as empiric therapy for anaerobic infections and susceptibility testing is not always routinely performed. Strains resistant to carbapenems have been found to produce metallo-beta-lactamase, an enzyme that hydrolyses various beta-lactam antibiotics and exhibits resistance to beta-lactamase inhibitors. B. fragilis metallo-beta-lactamase is encoded by the cfiA gene. Several diverse types of insertion sequence (IS) elements in the upstream region of cfiA in carbapenemresistant B. fragilis strains have been found. The IS elements most likely provide a promoter to express the cfiA. It has been reported that about 2-4% of the B. fragilis strains carry the cfiA gene regardless of whether they express it. Also an IS-less activation mechanism of cfiA in B. fragilis strains has been detected. The 5-nitroimidazole molecule is a prodrug whose activation depends up on the reduction of the nitro group in the absence of oxygen. Decreased uptake and/or alteration in reduction are believed to be responsible for metronidazole resistance. Five nim genes (A-E) have been described in the B. fragilis group that confer reduced susceptibility to 5-nitroimidazole compounds. nim-Positive strains have been shown to be more prone to induction than nim-negative isolates. A nimF gene has been detected in a metronidazole susceptible strain. Isolates lacking nim genes but still highly resistant to metronidazole have also been demonstrated which probably means that other resistance mechanisms are involved. Studies of protein expression patterns in metronidazole susceptible and metronidazole resistant B. fragilis strains have revealed a complex shift in the resistant strain resulting in both downand up-regulation of proteins with different molecular weight and isoelectric points. This might be part of a broader programme of genetic control that alters the physiology to protect and prevent metronidazole activation. Such alterations may also increase the virulence.",

            "text": "Unexpected resistance mechanisms behind known antibiotic resistance in anaerobic pathogen and their detection L. Dubreuil, J. Behra, L. Calvet (Lille, F) Despite resistance to all b-lactams (including imipenem) by production of a carbapenemase (cfiA gene), Bacteroides fragilis group strains may be resistant to the combination of b-lactams with b-lactamase inhibitor among imipenem susceptible strains. If a silent carbapenemase could be involved, in other cases the lack of porin in combination with the production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase (cep A gene) is responsible for the resistance to co-amoxiclav among B. fragilis (lack of the 45 kDa Outer Membrane Protein) or in B. thetaiotaomicron (lack of the 67 kDa OMP). In the last two years we were able to isolate metronidazole-resistant strains of B. fragilis (MIC from 16 to 256 mg/L). Their detection could be easily done using a disk-diffusion test if the incubation is prolonged for at least 48 hours. For one of these trains, the high-level metronidazole resistance was associated with the presence of two copies of the nim A gene on the chromosome (Marchandin H. et al.) . Decreased susceptibility to metronidazole (MIC 8 and 16 mg/ L) is still increasing in France and UK (Brazier et al.) as demonstrated by antibiotic surveys. With exception of the reference agar dilution method (NCCLS M11 A6), the detection remains problematic. Detection by disk-diffusion method is very difficult using 4 lg metronidazole disks and should be improved by using a 10 lg potency disk, Rosco disks or the E test method. Resistance to metronidazole is widespread as nim genes are nowadays found in Prevotella and Veillonella species. Intrinsic unknown resistance could be presumed from published studies such as low-level resistance to vancomycin, linezolid and ramoplanin for C. ramosum, to vancomycin and daptomycin for C. innocuum and to teicoplanin and ramoplanin for C. clostridioforme, respectively. With exception of C. innocuum (Leclercq et al.) most mechanisms had not been investigated. The physiologist and epidemiologist Peter Panum (1820-85), the bacteriologist Carl Salomonsen , and his assistant Christian Gram . Panum has gained international reputation for his epidemiological description of the measles epidemic in the Faroe Islands in 1846, but he also made significant experimental contributions to microbiology. In 1855-56, during his appointment as professor at the University of Kiel, he performed a series of laboratory experiments with dogs, in order to characterize the so-called 'putrescent poison', a substance claimed to be the causative agent of blood-poisoning. The dogs were given i.v. infusions of rotten meat juice in different modifications, and observed for symptoms and signs. His observations on the biological effects of putrescent poison bear striking similarities with present-day endotoxins, e.g. the characteristic symptoms and signs, the delay in onset of symptoms, and the preserved biological activity after long-term boiling. Panum at first rejected the possibility that the putrescent poison could be of bacterial origin, but later changed his opinion. From 1864 Panum served as professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen, and in his institute he established the first laboratory facilities for bacteriological studies in Denmark. Salomonsen was the first to perform microbiological examinations on an infected patient. They took place in 1873 at the Municipality Hospital in Copenhagen, where he treated a patient with pyaemia. In pus aspirated from an inflamed knee joint he was able to demonstrate streptococci, and he could also isolate the streptococci from a rabbit that had been inoculated with pus from the patient. In his thesis, which he wrote under the supervision of Panum from 1876-77, he described one of the earliest methods for making pure cultures of bacteria, using capillary glass tubes. From 1883, Salomonsen held Europe's first chair in bacteriology at the University of Copenhagen, and he played a leading role in the foundation the State Serum Institute in 1902. Salomonsens assistant, Gram, invented the Gram-stain during a short visit to Friedl\u00e4nder's laboratory in Berlin in 1884. He is probably the most famous of all Danish microbiologists, which is somewhat paradoxical, since he left microbiology immediately after his invention, and never worked with Gram staining afterwards. In 1898, the Danish Nobel laureate Johannes Fibiger published a controlled trial of the effect of serum treatment on diphtheria. Fibiger was one of the first to discuss random allocation as a method to avoid bias in clinical trials. He stated: 'A firm conclusion can in many cases only be reached when a large number of randomly selected patients are treated with a new remedy and an equally large number of randomly selected patients at the same time are treated as usual.' Fibiger's trial included as many as 484 patients that were allocated depending on day of admittance: serum treatment was used every second day and standard treatment every second day. Furthermore, the flow of patients, and other methodological and clinical aspects of the trial, were reported precisely. Thus, the trial is a pioneering investigation in the history of clinical trials.",

            "text": "Production of penicillin in Denmark during World War II. An early warning against development of antibiotic resistance K. Jensen (Karlshamn, S) It is well known to most people that penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming in his laboratory at St. Mary's Hospital. It was extremely difficult to produce and to purify penicillin in sufficient amounts to be used to treat humans. It was not until 1938 that Florey, Abraham and Chain succeeded in isolating and purifying Penicillin in pure and stable form thus allowing further studies of its unique activity, extremely low toxicity, and high clinical efficiency. It was found that penicillin was a true wonder drug in treating infected wounds. The production in large scale was attempted in England, but in 1941 It became necessary to move the entire project to USA to avoid the harassment caused by the German air raids. In USA the production of penicillin was considered of millitary importance The War Production Board in cooperation with 22 medical companies united in the efforts to produce penicillin in sufficient amounts for use by the allied millitary forces and for civil use. All informations about the production and purification processes were considered as war secrets, and the penicillium strains used for production were kept under strict custody. However, today it may not be widely known, that Denmark was the only place outside England and USA where the production of penicillin was taken up during World War II. This fact is even more remarkable because it took place during the German occupation of Denmark, when exchange of information with the free world was practically impossible, and resources of nearly every kind became increasingly scarce. The attempts to produce penicillin in Denmark were started during the spring of 1943 at the University Institute of General Pathology, and as early as September 1944 the first patient was treated with Danish penicillin. This remarkable achievement was made by the head of the institute professor K. A. Jensen. He came from the Danish Statens Serum Institute where he worked as a world-known scientist within the field of tuberculosis. He had experiences in standardization of biological products and production of tuberculin and BCG vaccine, and he was deeply engaged in research on antituberculous chemotherapy. He was thus well equipped to start the research on penicillin when he in 1941 took over the chair in general pathology. The late owner of the Leo Pharmaceutical Industry: Knud Abildgaard Elling initiated this research by providing him with a reprint obtained from Sweden of Florey, Abraham and Chain's article about penicillin. K. A. Jensen started the search for a penicillin producing mould, found it, and developed his own methods of production, purification, standardization and clinical trials of Penicillin. He succeeded so well, that the further development and production of penicillin in large scale was taken over by the Leo Pharmaceutical Industry. After the end of World War II \\\"Leo\\\" was able to take up the international competition, and succeeded so well that within a few years they supplied a substantial part of penicillin to the world market. K. A. Jensen was asked by the Danish Board of Health to distribute and control the clinical use, not only of penicillin, but of all the other new antibiotics which were introduced during the postwar period. This gave him a unique opportunity to develop the new field of clinical microbiology to warn against development of resistance and restrict the misuse of antibiotics in Denmark. As son of K.A. Jensen, the author had the opportunity to follow the above mentioned development as a personal witness. He will describe some of the exiting features of this pioneering work, and some of the perils of the work with penicillin in Denmark during wartime and German occupation.",

Recently, multilocus studies revealed the existence of atypical and recombinant genotypes. The relationship between isolate genotype and virulence is well described in the mouse model, but is more difficult to approach in humans due to the opportunistic behaviour of this parasite. For instance, in France, where the isolates are systematically collected and typed (Biological Resource Centre, ToxoBS group), the vast majority of congenital toxoplasmoses are due to type II, whatever the clinical outcome (foetal death, neurological involvement, chorioretinitis, or subclinical toxoplasmosis), the main prognosis factor remaining the stage of pregnancy at the time of infection. Whether this predominance of type II in congenital toxoplasmosis is due to its predominance in humans and animals in France or to a higher tendency to cross the placental barrier remains to be determined. The very few type I or atypical strains isolated from congenital toxoplasmosis are found in severe disease, notably disseminated toxoplasmosis, suggesting a role for the strain genotype in the pathogenesis of these forms. In immunocompetent patients, the 'serotyping' method has never been applied to large series of asymptomatic patients, so the strains responsible for about 80% of toxoplasmic infections in humans are still unknown. The classical lymphadenopathies seem to be due to type II strains, but more severe acquired toxoplasmosis or ocular toxoplasmosis are associated with atypical or type I strains. In immunodeficient patients, the 3 main types, principally type II, but also atypical or recombinant strains, were detected. These studies were performed mainly in some European countries and U.S.A. and the situation might well be different in other continents as suggested by the higher genetic diversity -and pathogenicity -of isolates in French Guiana or Brazil, or by the frequency of recombinant genotypes detected in African patients. Physiopathological and immunological aspects of the behaviour of the different Toxoplasma genotypes in humans are totally ignored. All our hypothesis (widespread parasite dissemination in organs for type I strains, cyst formation and reactivation with type II strains) are derived from mouse experimental toxoplasmosis and studies are needed to better understand the influence of strain genotype on human toxoplasmosis.",

            "text": "The policies for controlling and treating congenital toxoplasmosis differ between countries in Europe and include systematic monthly or three monthly screening during pregnancy, neonatal screening, widespread haphazard prenatal screening and a definite decision not to do anything. Treatment of newborns range from 3 months to 24 months with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine or sulfadoxine. The diversity of policies is due to different perception of the size of the problem and a lack of good studies, which can be used for decision making. Several studies have shown that the risk of infection with Toxoplasma gondii has been declining over the past four decades and studies based on data collected more than two decades ago can therefore not be used to estimate the risk of infection in to days pregnant mothers. To address these problems European centres have over the past thirteen years performed a range of studies on congenital toxoplasmosis starting with the performance of diagnostics assays, standardization of antibody-and nucleic acid diagnosis and case definitions. In 1997 the European Multi-centre Study on Congenital Toxoplasmosis, EMSCOT, was started as a large, multi-centre, prospective cohort study to provide solid evidence of the benefit of prenatal and neonatal screening. The study included fourteen European centres and when recruitment stopped in 2002, more than 1300 women with proven Toxoplasma gondii infection during pregnancy were enrolled giving birth to more than 250 infected children. This and other studies performed on other European cohorts showed clearly that prenatal screening and treatment to the pregnant mother failed to prevent transmission of Toxoplasma gondii from the mother to the child. The EMSCOT study is still being analysed and data on treatment effect on signs and symptoms in children with congenital toxoplasmosis will be presented. Two on-going studies building on the EMSCOT results are still on-going: SYROCOT, Systematic Review of Congenital Toxoplasmosis, aim at performing a meta-analysis of data from several cohorts including more than 2500 infected pregnant women; and EUROTOXO aim at critically reviewing existing data to provide a new platform for designing rational studies of prevention and treatment of congenital toxoplasmosis. Key data from the different European studies will be presented.",

            "text": "In Europe Lyme borreliosis is caused by at least 3 species, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii and B. garinii. Thus microbiological diagnosis in European patients must consider the heterogeneity of Lyme disease borreliae for development of diagnostic tools such as PCR primers and antigens. According to guidelines of the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology the serological diagnosis should follow the principle of a two step procedure (a strategy also recommended by the CDC). A sensitive ELISA (preferentially such differentiating IgM and IgG) is recommended as the first step. In case the ELISA is reactive, it is followed by immunoblots (IgM and IgG) as the second step. The reactive bands should be clearly identified, which is easy if recombinant antigens are used. The sensitivity and standardization of immunoblots has been considerably enhanced by use of recombinant antigens instead of whole cell lysates. Improved sensitivity resulted from use of recombinant proteins that are expressed primarily in vivo (e.g. VlsE) and combination of homologous proteins from different strains of borreliae Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 (e.g. DbpA). It also appears promising to use recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides as ELISA antigens. At present, detection rates for serum antibodies are 20-50% in stage I (erythema migrans), 70-90% in stage II (i.e. acute neuroborreliosis) , and nearly 100% in stage III Lyme disease (i.e. acrodermatitis and arthritis). The main goals for the future are to improve specificity in general and sensitivity for diagnosis of early manifestations (stage I and II). Detection of the etiological agent by culture or PCR should be confined to specific indications and specialized laboratories. Recommended specimens are skin biopsy specimens, CSF and synovial fluid. The best results are obtained from skin biopsies with culture or PCR (50-70%) and synovial tissue or fluid (50-70% with PCR). CSF yields positive results in only 10-30% of patients. Methods which are not recommended for diagnostic purposes are antigen tests in body fluids, PCR of urine and serum, and lymphocyte transformation tests. Interpretation of test results must always be done in context with clinical data. Here case definitions are helpful (1) . The low predictive value of positive serology in case of nonspecific symptoms need to be considered. 1 Thus far there have only been three known cases of vancomycin transposon A positive methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) reported, all in the USA. Fortunately these strains were all susceptible to many other antibiotics and screening failed to detect any spread to other patients. Two of the cases were seen in patients with diabetic related leg ulcers and were co-colonised with glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Other less vancomycin-resistant S. aureus isolates have been encountered (VISAs and hetero-resistant VISAs). In some instances there have been isolates that are only resistant to another glycopep-tide teicoplanin (TISAs e.g. some isolates of EMRSA-17 in the UK). A case-controlled study has been performed on these. Interestingly there have been relatively few cases of infections reported world-wide of GISA infections; Japan, for example, where the first isolates were described has failed to see the epidemic that was predicted. Isolates have often proved to be unstable in their resistance when stored in the laboratory or when cross infecting other patients who have not received vancomycin treatment. We will describe the current situation with types of MRSA that are commonly seen in Europe and the reports of the types of GISAs that have been encountered in the world. We will also discuss a possible ESCMID Study Group on Nosocomial Infection (ESGNI) study looking at GISAs and other important aspects of MRSA in the EU that would complement other European and previous ESGNI studies.",

For the prevalence study, toxin positive faecal samples (n = 123) were collected between February and August 2004 from a twelve different institutions in Dublin Ireland. C. difficile was cultured from faecal specimens. Toxin-specific enzyme immunoassays, IMR-90 cytotoxicity assay and PCR were used to analyse C. difficile isolates. Antibiotic sensitivities were determined using E-tests. Seventy-three cases of C. difficile diarrhoea were identified during the outbreak study period. Studies examining in vitro production of toxin A and B showed that ninety-five % of isolates tested negative for production of toxin A but were positive when investigated using the cell culture cytotoxicity assay. These toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive C. difficile isolates had a 1.7 kb deletion in the tcdA gene. PCR ribotyping determined that these isolates were clonal. The clonal outbreak isolates were resistant to all fluoroquinolones (MIC's of >32 lg ml )1 ) and MLS antibiotics tested (MIC's of >256 lg ml )1 ). In the prevalence study, 52 of 123 C. difficile isolates, (42%) were toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive. Prevalence rates per institution varied from 0-62%. In the three University teaching hospitals the prevalence rates were 18%, 40%, and 59% respectively. Using PCR, these toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive strains had the same deletion described for the outbreak study (toxinotype VIII strains e.g., C. difficile serotype F, 1470). Toxin A-negative, toxin B-positive C. difficile appears to be prevalent in hospitals in the greater Dublin area and caused at least one hospital outbreak.

The systematic reviews of antibiotics are small and come to different conclusions, and many physicians still prescribe antibiotics. Methods: 807 patients with acute LRTI were randomised to three prescribing strategies -immediate antibiotics, delayed prescription, and no offer of antibiotics. Half of each of these groups received an information leaflet. Results: Cough rated at least 'a slight problem' lasted on average 11.7 days (25% lasted 17+days). An information leaflet had no effect on the main outcomes. Compared with no offer of antibiotics, other strategies did not alter cough duration (delayed +0.75 days, 95% confidence intervals )0.37 to 1.88; immediate +0.11 days, )1.01 to 1.24) nor other primary outcomes. Antibiotics reduced duration of 'moderately bad' symptoms, a secondary outcome, by one day ()1.08; )2.1 to )0.09). Compared with the antibiotic group slightly fewer patients were 'very satisfied' in the delayed and control groups (respectively 86%, 77%, 72%, p < 0.005), fewer used antibiotics (96%, 20%,16%, p < 0.001) and fewer believed in the effectiveness of antibiotics (75%, 40%, 47%, p < 0.001). There was lower re-attendance for cough within a month with delayed and immediate prescribing (mean attendances: no antibiotics 0.19, delayed 0.12, immediate 0.11, Kruskal Wallis p = 0.03). Conclusion: For most patients with acute uncomplicated LRTI, no offer or a delayed offer of antibiotics was acceptable, associated with little difference in symptom resolution, and considerably reduced antibiotic use and beliefs in antibiotics. Delayed prescribing may have some advantages to not prescribing since fewer patients reconsulted. Objectives: To assess the appropriateness of antibiotic treatment in acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in primary care and to assess clinical patient characteristics that cause under-or overprescribing of antibiotics. Methods: During four weeks in winter (2002) (2003) , 146 Dutch general practitioners (GPs) from the middle region of the Netherlands included all patients with lower respiratory tract complaints. They registered patient demographics (age and gender), clinical presentation (signs and symptoms, like duration of complaints, cough, fever and dyspnoe), severity of illness, whether they thought patients expected antibiotic treatment, diagnosis and management. Using the current guidelines of the Dutch College of General Practitioners on LRTIs, we assessed the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing in cases of LRTIs. The association between clinical patient characteristics and under-/overtreatment was assessed by means of GEE (SAS) with odds ratios (ORs) (with 95% confidence intervals). Results: In more than 60% of LRTI-consultations antibiotic treatment was according to national guidelines. In three out of each ten LRTI-consultations antibiotics were not indicated but prescribed. High severity of illness, fever, purulent sputum and if the GP thought the patient expected an antibiotic, were independent predictors of this overtreatment with antibiotics (ORs between 1.6 and 10.0). In about one of each twenty LRTIconsultations antibiotics were indicated but not prescribed (undertreatment). In these cases mostly symptomatic treatment, like analgesics and cough suppressants, were prescribed. Conclusion: Incorrect interpretation of clinical patient characteristics and perceived expectation of patients were associated with overprescribing of antibiotics in cases of LRTIs in primary care. Overtreatment farly outweighs undertreatment.",

MacKenzie (Aberdeen, UK) Aggregated hospital antibiotic use data from 2001, collected from 140 European ARPAC hospitals are presented. This work was carried out under the auspices of the ESCMID Study Group on Antibiotic Policies. Methods: Antibiotic use was measured in DDD/100 occupied bed-days (BD), using DDDs described by the WHO (2004). Data are described for individual antibiotics as well as the ATC J01 classes. Data were analysed by various demographic characteristics. Relationships between antibiotic use and resistance were also explored. Results: For all hospitals, the antibiotic use range was 5-129 DDD/100 BD (median = 55, IQR 40, 73). For all hospitals, J01C (penicillin B-lactams) were used most often, followed by J01D (non-penicillin B-lactams) and quinolones with median values of 22, 10 and 6 DDD/100 BD. Total and class antibiotic use varied significantly by geographical region. It did not vary significantly by hospital size, teaching status or case mix. Median total antibiotic use for the north, south-east, south, west and centre/east (regions 1-5 respectively) was 48, 45, 81, 63 and 37 DDD/100 BD respectively. Median use of J01C for regions 1-5 was 25, 13, 24, 29 and 12 DDD/100 BD. The most used sub-class were the B-lactamase inhibitor combinations (J01CR) making up 1, 27, 79, 67 and 48% of J01C for regions 1-5 respectively. There was a significant relationship between the number of individual antibiotics listed per hospital (maximum n = 80) and total antibiotic use; the higher the number of antibiotic available, the higher the total use. The North of Europe had the highest number of antibiotics listed but had relatively low total use; which may indicate better control. A large proportion of total antibiotic use was accounted for by a minority number of individual antibiotics; on average, the top 10 most frequently used antibiotics accounted for 75% of total use. The most frequently used individual antibiotics were amoxicillin + enzyme inhibitor (oral), amoxicillin + enzyme inhibitor (parenteral), ciprofloxacin (oral), cefuroxime (parenteral) and amoxicillin (oral). Of 7 groups of antibiotics tested, total antibiotic use (both including and excluding glycopeptide use) as well as use of 3rd generation cephalosporins showed a significant, positive correlation with MRSA prevalence (unadjusted, unweighted tests). After removal of variation in MRSA due to demographic factors, a strong statistically significant partial correlation was found between MRSA prevalence and macrolide use.",

Results: There was geographical variation in antibiotic policy factors, with hospitals from North and Western Europe more likely than those from other regions to have written antibiotic policies (N 79%, W 72%, CE 54%, S 46%, SE 25%; P < 0.01), written antibiotic formularies (W 94%, N 84%, CE 85%, S 59%, SE 42%; P < 0.01) and to have drugs and therapeutics committees in 2001 (N 100%, W 98%, CE 88%, SE 69%, S 68%; P < 0.01).

            "text": "Malaria remains one of the main global communicable disease problems of our time. It is estimated that the malaria incidence in 2004 in 111 countries affected by malaria was 350-450 million cases. The disease is responsible for over 1 million deaths in the world per year, mainly in tropical Africa, where it is a principal cause of nearly 20% of all young child deaths; malaria mortality in eastern and southern Africa almost doubled over the period 1992-1998 compared with 1982-1989 possibly as a result of increasing resistance to chloroquine; in addition, malaria is an important indirect cause of death for example through malaria-related maternal anaemia in pregnancy and low birth weight. The disease impedes economic growth in tropical developing countries not only as a result of the mortality and morbidity burden and the expenditures for prevention and treatment but also because it is a powerful deterrent to foreign investment. For industrialized countries, malaria is mainly a problem in travelers, who suffer a total of about 10,000 acute disease episodes per year. Despite small outbreaks in industrialized countries around the world, there is no evidence that the disease is returning to temperate regions as a result of global warming or other factors. Effective tools for prevention, control and treatment are now available. Among the most important are long-lasting insecticidal nets, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy, artemisininbased combination therapy, artemisinin-based suppositories, and rapid diagnostic tests. International transfers for malaria control have greatly increased since the establishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and have now reached a level of about USD 400 million per year. The key challenge to developing countries is now to improve health systems and to recruit and maintain the health workforce, which is needed at all levels of the system for cost-effective use of resources and tools and documentation of results. The main challenge to the scientific community and industry is to develop new antimalarial treatments, new insecticides and methods for vector control, better diagnostics and, possibly, effective vaccines. New antimalarial drugs that have been investigated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, in recent years are as follows. atovaquone, a hydroxynaphthoquinone, was evaluated and it was found that atovaquone alone proved safe and effective. All patients treated had clinical cure, however, one third of patients had late recrudescence (RI). When it was combined with proguanil, the cure rate increased to 100%. This combination has now been developed into a fixed drug named Malarone. Artemisinine derivatives such as artesunate, artemether, arteether and dihydroartemisinin are also tested at the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases. Artesunate and artemether alone at a total dose of 600 to 750 mg. given over 5-7 days produced cure rates of 80 to 95%. Artesunate or dihydroartemisinin suppositories at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day have been proved successful for the treatment of severe malaria. The artemisinin derivatives, (4 mg/ kg/day) when used in combination with mefloquine (8 mg/kg/ day) given once a day for 3 days gave improved cure rates, up to 95-100%. Dihydroartemisinin alone with a total dose of 480 mg given over 5 days gave a cure rate of 90%. Arteether, a WHO/TDR supported drug, has been evaluated in the Hospital and now has been registered for use (the same dose of artemether) in severe malaria under the name Artemotil. \u00d2 Other combinations (artemisinin derivatives combined with tetracycline or doxycycline and mefloquine combined with tetracycline or doxycycline) have also been evaluated with improvement in cure rates. Recently, a fixed drug (artemether plus lumefantrine) named Coartem \u00d2 (six doses given over 72 hours) proved to be a safe and effective drug (cure rate over 95%) for the treatment of falciparum malaria and it has been registered for use in many western countries. At present, studies with combinations of artemisinin derivatives plus mefloquine (in various doses and durations of treatment) are being investigated. Recently we have finished the double-blind, randomized, comparative study of 200 patients (adults and children) with falciparum malaria treated by a pre-packed blister approach (4 mg/kg/day artesunate and 8 mg/kg/day given once a day for 3 days) and found that this approach proved safe and effective and this approach could translate clinically into a better patient compliance. Other fix-combinations (Artecom \u00d2 , Artekin \u00d2 ) proved safe and efficious (cure rate over 98%) and could be an alternative antimalarial drugs. In general, artemisinin derivatives (12 mg/kg total dose given in 3 days) combined with mefloquine (25 mg/kg total dose given in 3 days) have been a standard regimen for the treatment of multidrug resistant falciparum malaria in Thailand. Until proven otherwise, drug combinations are still recommended for all adult patients suffering from acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria contracted in multidrug resistant areas. The treatment for uncomplicated malaria is aimed at producing a radical cure using the combination of either (1) artesunate (4 mg/kg/day) plus mefloquine (8 mg/kg/day) for 3 days; (2) a fixed dose of artemether and lumefantrine (20/120 mg tablet) named Coartem (4 tablets twice a day for three days for adults weighing more than 35 kg); (3) quinine 10 mg/kg 8-hourly plus tetracycline 250 mg 6-hourly for 7 days (or doxycycline 200 mg once a day for 7 days as an alternative to tetracycline) in patients aged 8 years and over; and (4) a combination of atovaquone and Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 proguanil called Malarone (in adult, 4 tablets given daily 3 days). In treating severe malaria, early diagnosis and early treatment with a potent antimalarial drug is recommended to save the patient's life. The antimalarial drugs of choice are: intravenous quinine or a parenteral form of an artemisinin derivative (artesunate i.v./i.m. 2.4 mg/kg followed by 1.2 mg/ kg injection at 12 and 24 hr and then daily for 5 days; artemether i.m. 3.2 mg/kg injection followed by 1.6 mg/kg at 12 and 24 hrs and then daily for 5 days; artemether i.m. (Artemotil ) with the same dose of artemether; artesunate suppository (5 mg/kg) given rectally 12 hourly for 3 days). Oral artemisinin derivatives (artesunate, artemether, dihydroartemisinin with the dose 4 mg/kg/day should replace parenteral forms when patients can tolerate oral medication. Oral mefloquine (25 mg/kg divided into two doses 8 hrs apart) should be given at the end of the artemisinin treatment course to reduce recrudescence. The treatment of vivax malaria in Thailand is still using chloroquine and primaquine. However with the ineffective to primaquine (15 mg/kg/day for 14 days with relapse rate of 15%) the higher dose (30 mg/kg/day for 14 days) is recommended. The efficacy studies of primaquine in various regimen given together with Sulfadoxin/Pyrimethamine or artemisinin derivatives are in progress. Tefenoquine \u00d2 phase III study in the planning stage for clinical trial in our setting in Thailand is in progress.",

            "text": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a rogue bacterium in the intensive care unit (Symposium arranged with ESICM) S43 Role of efflux pumps in multiresistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa J. Vila (Barcelona, E) Pseudomonas aeruginosa are an important cause of opportunistic nosocomial infections. A major feature of this microorganism is the increasing resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. Three main factors contribute to this multiresistance: i. The intrinsic resistance; ii. Facility to acquire resistance and iii. Ability to survive in moist environments. Intrinsic multiresistance can be due to the interplay between the low permeability of the outer membrane which, for some antibiotics, is 10 to 100-fold less than that of Escherichia coli and the constitutive expression of some efflux pump(s). Currently, at least five main efflux pumps associated with the resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents have been shown (MexAB-OprM, MexCD-OprJ, MexXY-OprM, MexEF-OprN and MexVW-OprM). These efflux pumps have different substrate specificities. The constitutive expression of MexAB-OprM seems to play an important role in intrinsic multiresistance since mutations that prevent expression of this efflux pump result in hypersusceptibility to quinolones, tetracyclines, chloram-phenicol, trimethoprim and some b-lactam antibiotics. On the other hand, MexXY-OprM may have a primary role in intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides and erythromycin. However, the greatest therapeutic problems occur when these multi-drug efflux pumps are overproduced, generating a high level of multiresistance. This scenario can also be observed during the course of treatment of an infection caused by P. aeruginosa. Unfortunately, the emergence of resistance during therapy is not a rare event in this microorganism. An in depth study analysing the prevalence of the overproduction of each of the abovementioned efflux pumps in clinical strains of P. aeruginosa has not been performed. However, efflux pump-overproducing P. aeruginosa mutants selected during the treatment of infections may range from 50 to 80%. The acquisition of resistance during therapy is normally associated with specific mutations. Hypermutability is an important factor which, together with a high inoculum in the infection site and the ability of P. aeruginosa to produce biofilm, may contribute to therapeutic failures. Knowledge of the prevalence of efflux pumps in the acquisition of multiresistance in P. aeruginosa clinical isolates and the ability of the different antimicrobial agents to select resistant mutants would help in the selection of the appropriate therapy.",

Drobniewski (London, UK) Drug resistant, and particularly multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) is increasing globally particularly in Eastern Europe, but the actual incidence is unknown. Countries with effective TB programmes see low rates of MDRTB amongst new cases annually. Hot spots with high rates such as countries of the former Soviet Union exist and modelling of existing data suggest that between 250-500 000 new MDRTB cases occur globally. MDRTB is particularly difficult to treat, particularly when co-existing with HIV infection, and carries a high mortality compared to drug sensitive disease. Although modern rifampicin-based short course treatments are effective against drug sensitive and mono-resistant disease (apart from rifampicin resistance), MDRTB therapy is difficult and prolonged. Survival requires therapy with at least three agents to which the bacteria are susceptible. New research has produced many rapid and novel methods to diagnose drug resistance earlier which may confer some survival or public health advantage as may other processes that reduce diagnostic delay including the reduction of stigma. In high income countries, individualised therapy forms the gold standard of treatment but the substantial laboratory costs associated with this approach have led to studies of standardised treatment in middle/low income countries. Studies in Peru examined both approaches with comparable success. Nevertheless even standardized treatment requires an accurate survey of drug resistance and an understanding and correction of the initial causes of high rates of MDRTB. Few new drugs are available for treatment and the individual and health system costs of treating drug resistant cases are high emphasising the critical importance of curing drug sensitive tuberculosis at first presentation. The presentation will discuss some of the management options available for the treatment of resistant disease.",

Therefore, a number of recent evidence based guidelines for the management of patients with respiratory tract infections also include guidelines on microbiological diagnosis, including both conventional and new techniques. Competition between traditional and new techniques are conditioned by: rapidity and quality of results, need for special infrastructure and trained personnel, possibility to deliver results 24/24 hours 7/7 days and cost. In pneumonia blood and pleural exsudate cultures are positive in only 4-18% and up to 40% of cases respectively. However, as they offer a highly specific diagnosis, blood cultures should be performed in hospitalised patients with CAP and thoracentesis when significant pleural fluid is present. Quantitative bacterial cultures may be important for the assessment of BAL and PSB fluid: advantages and limitations will be discussed. The most frequently submitted specimen is sputum. Criteria for good quality sputum are now universally accepted but there are still great controversies about the value of sputum Gram stain and culture. Gram strain of a valuable sputum showing a predominant morphotype correlates well with the results of boodcultures, is a rapid and low cost technique allowing a presumptive etiological diagnosis of pneumonia in many cases, allows correct interpretation of sputum culture results and therefore is recommended. Urine antigen detection is recommended for the diagnosis of L. pneumophila infections but for S. pneumoniae more studies are needed. Serological tests usually produce late results particularly for the 'atypicals', while the multitude of procedures for C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae produce divergent results. Some recent studies on the improved detection of these agents by molecular tests illustrate the often low predictive value of serology showing the limited application in the routine management of the individual patient. Based on recent studies and guidelines, indications for the use of a number of conventional diagnostic techniques in different clinical situations will be discussed. A compromise must often be found between the value of the test, feasibility turnaround time and cost.",

Despite of advances in the development of vaccines and of the appearance of new antibiotics, the incidence of pneumonia does not decrease. This is probably due to the ageing of the population, an increase in the number of immunodepressed persons, and an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases. Knowing the etiology of pneumonia is of great significance because it permits an empirical antibiotic therapy to be converted into a specific one, which contributes to optimizing costs and probably helps conserve bacterial ecology. The etiological diagnosis of CAP in the majority of cases remains uncertain. An adequate sputum specimen is often difficult to obtain, and even then, the specimen is frequently contaminated with oropharyngeal bacteria. The blood culture is positive in less of a 20% of cases. Serological tests requires to be performed preferably in paired serum samples, providing a retrospective diagnostic. Various recent studies from distinct geographical areas coincide in that the etiological yield is lower than 60% with conventional microbiological diagnostic techniques. The most frequent aetiological agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In the severe cases of pneumonia the first 3 etiologies should always be considered. Techniques for antigen detection of L. pneumophila and S. pneumoniae in urine samples have, in the last few years, been demonstrated to be rapid, sensitive and specific. In addition, the use of urine samples concentrated by selective ultrafiltration procedure improves the sensitivity significantly. In our experience, these techniques have proven to be useful in the diagnosis of CAP. Given the large number of diagnostics, even when the patient has received prior treatment with antibiotics, the use of these techniques is highly recommendable as having the etiological diagnosis available allows antibiotic treatment to be adjusted, the importance of which it is not necessary to point out.",

            "text": "Antibiotic usage: practices and policy interventions O53 Self-medication with antibiotics in Europe Results: The overall response rate was 40% (ranging 18-70% between the countries). The rates of actual and 'at risk' selfmedication as well as prescribed use of antibiotics tend to be high in southern and eastern European countries and low in western and northern countries (table 1). The main sources of self-medication were directly from pharmacy without prescription (58% of all self-medication courses), leftovers (32%) and friends/relatives (8%). The most common reasons for self-medication use reported by the respondents were throat symptom (20% of self-medication courses), teeth/gum symptom (15%), acute bronchitis (9%), influenza (7%), urinary tract infection (7%) upper respiratory infection (6%). Penicillins (J01C) was the most frequently used antibiotic group for self-medication (figure 1). Younger age, country, presence of chronic diseases and prescribed use of antibiotics were related to self-medication use. Gender and location (urban/rural) were not associated with actual self-medication with antibiotics. Conclusions: Self-medication with antibiotics is a problem in all European countries in varying degrees, with low levels in North and West and high levels in South and East. This consistency underlines the relevance of health care system and cultural factors for antibiotic use. Broad spectrum penicillins tend to be used for self-medication more frequently in South and East. Results were expressed as DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID). Detailed information on the sources of antibiotic use data can be found at the ESAC website (www.ua.ac.be/ESAC). Of the 34 participating countries 21,19 and 2 were able to deliver outpatient, hospital and total data, resp., for 2003. In view of the expected change of DDD for parenteral co-amoxicillin, a pilot study on the pattern of consumption of antibiotics with multiple DDDs was conducted, based on data subdivided by route of administration. Results: Outpatient antibiotic use varied with a factor of 3.2 between the countries with the lowest and highest consumption, c.q. still the Netherlands (9.8 DID) and for the first time Greece (31.4 DID). Consumption in France decreased by 7.1% the year after their first national campaign. A similar reduction was seen in Belgium ()7.6%) after the first Belgian campaign. Hospital antibiotic use ranged between 1.4 DID in Norway and 3.6 DID in France. Nine substances with multiple DDDs were identified within the J01 ATC group: amoxicillin and enzyme inhibitor, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, fosfomycin are available in oral and parenteral form, tobramycin in inhalatory and parenteral form, while DDDs for erythromycin and methenamine differ according to their chemical salts. Specifically consumption of parenteral co-amoxicillin was substantial in 4 out of 10 countries, which were able to deliver detailed data. Conclusion: ESAC data underpin the success of two national campaigns on antibiotic prescribing (Belgium and France). An introduction or change of DDD for a specific form of any antibiotic can substantially influence the profile of antibiotic consumption in some countries.

There is an international trend to prescribe more new and broad spectrum antibiotics, Objectives: To estimate the impact of a therapeutic counselling intervention based on a standardized decisional approach aimed at fostering and guiding reassessment of antibiotic therapy 3 days after initial prescription on the appropriateness of IV antibiotic therapy in hospitalised patients. Methods: Interim analysis of an ongoing prospective crossover cohort study in 2 similar internal medicine wards in a 850-bed university hospital. Predefined, standardized decisional algorithms based on chart review were used in the intervention group to evaluate 5 steps in IV antibiotic therapy: indication, choice of antibiotic, administration route, dose, and duration of therapy. Physicians in charge of included patients received a standardized, itemized evaluation form that included proposals if applicable. The present interim analysis included only patients hospitalised in the first intervention ward during the 6-month period before crossover. We compared appropriateness of IV antibiotic therapy 3 days after prescription during the first and the second trimesters of the intervention. Results: 109 IV antibiotic therapies were evaluated, 43 in the first trimester and 66 in the second trimester. The proportion of fully appropriate antibiotic therapies was higher during the second trimester: 41/66 (62%) vs. 14/43 (33%, p < 0.01, Fisher exact test). For all specific items of the evaluation there was a trend towards better antibiotics use in the second trimester: appropriate indication (94% vs. 83%, p = 0.10), appropriate antibiotic choice (88% vs. 79%, p = 0.28), and appropriate administration route (80% vs. 63%, p = 0.05). Total antibiotic consumption was higher during the second trimester, however: 352 vs. 299 prescribed daily doses/1,000 patients-days (of which 68% vs. 62% were given by IV route, and 19% vs. 18% were broad-spectrum antibiotics). Since antibiotics were used more appropriately during the second trimester, this higher antibiotic consumption may reflect a higher burden of infection. Conclusion: Although more definite results are expected after study completion, this interim analysis showed a promising potential of a counselling intervention based on standardized decisional algorithms to improve the use of IV antibiotics.",

            "text": "Objectives: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) shows a high propensity to establish chronic infection. Interferon-alpha in combination with ribavirin is standard therapy for hepatitis C. However, this treatment is still limited by a high non-response rate. As CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes are thought to play a crucial role in the course of HCV infection, we evaluated the magnitude of HCV-specific CD8+-T cell response during therapy, and its effect on the dynamics of CD8+-T cell subsets: CD45RA+/ CCR7+ (naive), CD45RA+/CCR7) (effector), CD45RA-/CCR7+ (central memory) and CD45RA-/CCR7) (memory/effector). Methods: We studied 5 HLA-A2+ healthy controls and 11 HLA-A2+ patients chronically infected with HCV. Patients were treated with IFN-alpha and ribavirin, during 48 weeks for genotype 1, and 24 weeks for genotypes 2 and 3. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected before treatment, and one, three and six months after the end of treatment. They were analyzed at specific time points by four-colour flow cytometry using HLA-A2 HCV-peptide specific tetramers, together with a panel of phenotypic markers of homing and differentiation: CCR7 and CD45RA, respectively. Results: Patients infected with HCV displayed an increase in the percentage of HCV-specific CD8+T cells, when compared with healthy controls. Our results pointed to a more pronounced increase of HCV-specific CD8+T cells in patients who responded to treatment. The phenotypic pattern of the CD8+T-cell subsets studied was altered in therapy responders, when compared with healthy controls. The more significant differences were a decrease in the percentage of CD45RA+/CCR7-cells and an increase in CD45RA+/CCR7+ cells in therapy responders. In contrast, non-responder patients seemed to present a similar pattern for all CD8+-T cell subsets, as control individuals. Conclusions: Our results seem to indicate that the success of treatment for hepatitis C is related to a significant increase in HCV-specific CD8+T cells. Moreover, the relative proportions of the CD8+ T cell subsets studied appear to be important for a successful outcome of response. The decrease in CD45RA+/ CCR7-subset of HCV-specific CD8+-T cell observed in peripheral blood of responder patients could be explained with their massive recruitment to the liver, which leads to a relative increase in CD45RA+/CCR7+ cells. Further prospective large studies are needed to confirm these observations. Work partially supported by Roche Pharma Portugal. Objective: Chronic C hepatitis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with HIV infection. Although treatment with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin has significantly improved the outcome, HCV co-infection remains a major threat for HIV patients. Recent findings suggest that treatment of HCV infection in its acute phase may be very successful, but no data are available on acute infection in HIVpositive patients. We report four HIV-positive patients with acute C hepatitis treated with PEG-IFN alpha-2b for 12 weeks. Methods: Inclusion criteria were documented seroconversion, positive HCV-RNA and elevated ALT levels with a known risk factor in the preceding 6 month in patients with HIV infection, na\u00efve for antiretroviral therapy, with the CD4 cell count >400/ mm 3 . Patients received PEG-IFN alpha-2b ranging from 1.1 to 1.5 lg/Kg once weekly for 12 weeks. ALT, CD4 cell count, HCV-RNA and HIV-RNA measurements were made at week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after the end of treatment. The primary endpoint was the sustained viral response (SVR). Monitoring of critical HIV immuno-virological parameters was also performed. Results: Two patients had HCV genotype 1. Risk factors for HIV and HCV transmission were intravenous drug use (50%) and sexual exposure (50%). At baseline, median HCV-RNA level was 1.478.000 copies/mL (range: 3.200-7.600.000); the median HIV-RNA level was 50.000 copies/mL (range: 20.000-2.600.000). Treatment was given within 120 days (range: 30-120) of the ALT level peak. At week 4 HCV-RNA was undetectable in all patients but one, who never had a negative HCV-RNA. SVR was achieved in three patients. The non responder patient received a lower interferon dosage. At week 1 there was a mean decrease of HIV-RNA of 0.6 log10, which did not change until the end of therapy. No significant decrease of CD4 cell count was observed. Conclusions: Treatment with PEG-IFN administered for 12 weeks is effective, well tolerated and is not associated with any significant change of HIV infection parameters. As also seen in other settings, higher PEG-IFN dosage may be associated with SVR. According to recent studies the treatment of acute C hepatitis can provide a unique opportunity for a sustained control of HCV infection in HIV patients.",

Lozano, P. Mu\u00f1 oz de Rueda, J. Salmer\u00f3 n, J. Hern\u00e1ndez-Quero, F. Garc\u00eda (Granada, Seville, E) Background: Mutations in the Interferon Sensitivity Determining Region (ISDR) in the NS5a of HCV genome have been related in some studies with an increased response to Interferon+ribavirin (IFN+RBV) therapy. Little information on PegIFN plus RBV therapy has been developed and, to our knowledge, none on HCV/HIV-coinfected patients undergoing combination therapy. Aim: To investigate the differences between HCV/HIVcoinfected and HCV-monoinfected patients in terms of ISDR variability and its predictability over response to PegIFN plus RBV treatment. Patients and Methods: ISDR was investigated by means of an in house protocol: RNA was extracted with Quiamp Viral RNA Kit (Quiagen), and subjected to an RT-PCR with 'ONE STEP RT-PCR System' (Roche), subsequently, a nested-PCR was performed. Specific primers were used for genotypes 1a, 1b and 3. ISDR sequences were obtained using the Open Gene System (Bayer). The study included 69 patients: 47 were HCV/ HIV-coinfected and 22 were HCV-monoinfected. Baseline characteristics were similar amongst groups, except for sex (male 83% in coinfected, against 54% in HIV negative patients) and HCV genotype: for HCV/HIV-coinfected patients, 23 were genotype 3a and 24 were genotype 1 (8 1b and 16 1a). All HCVmonoinfected patients were by genotype 1 (17 1b and 5 1a). Results: For the genotype 1 population, ISDR mutations were statistically more prevalent for HCV-monoinfected patients than for HIV-coinfected patients: only 2/24 (8%) coinfected patients harboured wild-type viruses while 9/22 (41%) of the monoinfected patients were wild type in the ISDR (p = 0.01). According to ISDR scorage (intermediate: 1-3 mutations; mutant > 3 mutations), no mutant ISDR strains were recorded for the monoinfected group while 2/24 (8%) from the coinfected group were mutant strains (p = 0.02). Sustained viral response (SVR) is available so far for 16 coinfected and for all the monoinfected patients: the number of mutations in the ISDR was statistically related to SVR only in the monoinfected group (p = 0.023). For genotype 3a coinfected patients, ISDR mutations were as follows: 15 wt, 4 intermediate and 4 were mutants; no relationship between ISDR mutations and a SVR was observed for these patients. Conclusions: ISDR in HCV1a and HCV1b from HIV-coinfected patients shows a higher variability than HCV-monoinfected patients. SVR was associated with higher number of mutations in ISDR region only in HIV negative patients.",

The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of mortality in a cohort of hepatitis C patients. Methods: The cohort comprised of hepatitis C patients of the Trent region of UK and has been followed up since 1991. Subjects were recruited through secondary care referrals such as from general practice clinics, drug and alcohol clinics, and prisons. As of 1st January 2004, information on mortality for 1345 patients was available from death certificates sent by the National Health Service Central Register. Descriptive statistics and survival analysis were used to describe the mortality patterns. Results: 8.3% of the cohort died during the follow-up period of 13 years. The approximate probability of surviving after 6 years of follow-up was 93% and after 10 years was 89%. The mean survival time was 6.47 years (standard deviation 2.73). The mean age at death was 50.95 years (standard deviation 15.68 years). The causes of death in the cohort were grouped into three categories -HCV related from liver disease, HCV unrelated from other medical problems such as cardiac diseases, and lifestyle factors like drug overdose, suicide and murder. Most subjects (40%) had died from HCV related liver disease while 37% died from unrelated medical causes. 22% of deaths were attributable to lifestyle factors such as injecting drug overdose, suicide and murder. The highest percentage (42%) of death was in the younger age group 36-50 years. Younger subjects (under 50 years) died mostly due to lifestyle related causes while maximum HCV related deaths were in 51-65 year olds (p < 0.001). Deaths unrelated to HCV infection occurred mostly in those over 65 years old. Conclusions: There are two striking findings of this study on mortality in a highly representative sample of HCV patients. Firstly, majority of deaths occurred in the 36-50 years age group and not in older subjects. Secondly, many young people died as a result of drug overdose and suicide. This higher mortality in younger subjects could be explained by the confounding effect of injecting drug use which was the main route of infection in these subjects. Thus, deaths in HCV patients could thus result not only from liver disease but also from factors related to their lifestyle.",

Objectives: To determine the prevalence of HCV in patients presenting with chronic peripheral inflammatory arthritis (CPIA) and, the clinical forms of CPIAs associated with HCV in a 425 beds teaching hospital reference of the Bay of Cadiz (over 250,000 inhabitants). Methods: Prospective case-control study in 1687 patients presenting with CPIA as their predominant symptom (excluding cristal induced and degenerative arthritis), mean age (\u00b1SD) 47.6 \u00b1 17.3 years, 64% of them women (n = 1080). Control groups: 643 consecutive patients with non-inflammatory chronic arthritis (NICA), and 4315 consecutive first time blood donors (BD) matched for age and sex. HCV status was determined (3rd generation ELISA confirmation by RT-PCR, and HCV genotype). Results: The prevalence of HCV antibodies (5.6%) in patients with CPIA was higher than that in patients with NICA (2.6%) or BD (0.88%) (p < 0.01 in both cases). The prevalence of chronic HCV infection was higher in patients with CPIA (4.3%) than in BD (0.88%). The prevalence of chronic HCV infection by final diagnosis as compared to BD was: 3.1% for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (p < 0.01), 6.4% for seronegative RA (p < 0.005), 11.9% for intermitent mono-oligoarthritis (p < 0.001), 6.0% for Sj\u00f6 gren's syndrome (p < 0.005), and 9.8% for systemic lupus erythematosus (p < 0.001). The prevalence of chronic HCV infection in psoriasic arthritis, seronegative spondyloarthropathies, and other final diagnosis was not different than that in BD. CPIA associated to HCV infection was non erosive/non deforming in 76% of the patients. Type II cryoglobulins and, decreased levels of C4/C3 were detected in 37% and 48%/22% of the patients with CPIA associated to HCV infection, respectively. Conclusions: An increased prevalence of HCV infection exists in patients presenting with chronic peripheral inflammatory arthritis. HCV antibodies (3rd generation ELISA) overestimates the prevalence of HCV infection in those patients. A search for HCV infection should be performed in the diagnostic process of both inflammatory arthritis and collagen vascular diseases.",

Methods: Serial ten-fold dilutions of two HCV RNA positive controls (Accurun, BBI), 170,000 and 910,000 IU/ml, respectively, were amplified and the data from the resulting calibration curve were stored in the LightCycler database for the quantification of plasma HCV RNA. Clinical samples were tested in a rapid single-tube RTiPCR reaction and cost-effective HCV RNA quantification was determined using one reference standard during each assay. The quantification obtained for the single reference standard was validated in a comparative analysis with the stored calibration curve followed by interpolation of the amount of HCV RNA in the clinical samples. HCV sequencing was directly performed using 10 ll of purified real time PCR amplicons. Results: A total of 2,470 plasma samples were tested from Oct 2002 to Sept 2004. HCV RNA was quantified in 1,226 samples with a dynamic range of 57 to 2.5 \u00b7 10.9 IU/ml and the theoretical threshold was 53 IU/ml. The standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (CV) of the HCV RNA levels were 1.08 and 3.55% for the 170,000 IU/ml standard and 1.34 and 4.78% for the 910,000 IU/ml standard. In 266 samples the amplicons were purified and sequenced for HCV genotyping (Bayer Diagnostics). Thirty five different HCV strains were typed: the majority were genotype 1b (36%) and 2 (30%), but genotypes 4 and 5 were also identified. Conclusions: Our study shows that this HCV RTiPCR protocol, which has been used for 2 years to test over 2,000 samples with minimal SD and CV values, allows accurate quantitation of HCV RNA in clinical samples. The characteristics of rapidity and accuracy have been extended to include cost-effectiveness due to subsequent use of the amplicons for sequencing. Objectives: Infants born from HBsAg positive mothers who are not responding to primary vaccination schedule are likely to develop HBV infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate anti-HBs response following administration of two doses of hepatitis B vaccine in this group of infants. Methods: From April 1998 to September 2004,Thirty-four nonresponder infants born from HBsAg positive mothers received two additional doses of hepatitis B vaccine one month apart at 15 months of age. Anti-HBs levels in these infants were evaluated two months after the later dose. Results: Eighteen girls and 16 boys were evaluated in this study. The mothers of 4 infants (11.8%) were HBe Ag positive and in 30 infants (88.2%)were HBe Ag negative. HBs Ab production was seen in 32 (94%) cases of vaccine recipients (96.6%infants of anti HBe Ag positive and 75%infants of HBe Ag positive mothers) (p = 0.225). Mean HBsAb level in girls and boys was 232 and 215 IU/L, respectively (p = 0.142). Conclusion: With administration of additional two doses of hepatitis B vaccine, protective levels of anti-HBs developed in 94% of non-responder infants. Objectives: Hepatitis B virus infection is an important cause of liver disease among patients with chronic renal failure. The vaccination against hepatitis B can considerably decrease number of these infections. The vaccination against hepatitis B was performed in 769 patients with chronic renal failure from 4 dialysis units. Anti-HBs antibodies response after immunisation and breakthrough infections were investigated in these patients. Methods: Active immunisation against hepatitis B was commenced in 1988. The number of immunised patients gradually increased and the group included 769 patients in November 2004. Of these patients, 328 died during investigation. The vaccination schedule was 0, 1, 6 months for pre-dialysis patients and 0, 1, 2 months for dialysis patients and patients with renal transplantation. Plasma-derived or since 1990 recombinant vaccines were administered intramuscularly, each vaccine contained 40 lg of HBsAg, but for pre-dialysis patients only 20 lg till 1998. The immunisation schedules were completed in 622 patients. Blood samples were obtained 6 weeks after third or next dose of vaccine and biannual thereafter. Samples were tested by ELISA for HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc. The patients without protective anti-HBs level after basic vaccination were once or twice re-vaccinated. The patients with vanishing of anti-HBs antibodies were also re-vaccinated. Results: Anti-HBs antibodies after vaccination were investigated in 488 patients. Protective anti-HBs levels were proved in 241 of 488 patients (47%) after basic immunisation and in 309 (63%) or 347 (71%) patients after fourth or fifth dose of vaccine. The new HBsAg positive status was proved in 28 dialysis patients, most of them suffered from acute hepatitis B. These breakthrough infections were more frequent after initiation of vaccination programme, 27 of them in period 1988-1994, the latest breakthrough infection was proved in 2000. Asymptomatic infections with new appearance of anti-HBc antibodies were observed in 11 patients. Anamnestic response (double or higher increase of anti-HBs without revaccination) was observed in 42 patients. Conclusion: Vaccination against hepatitis B in 769 patients with chronic renal failure was not quite satisfactory. Only 71% of them developed protective anti-HBs level after 5 doses of vaccine, but long-term vaccination considerably reduced hepatitis B incidence in our patients. Several pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that when the same total dose of azithromycin is administered over shorter regimens a patient's exposure to azithromycin is actually higher than if the dose was administered over a longer period of time. As such, even though the 1.5 g regimen has been marketed as both a 5-day and 3-day course patients actually have a higher exposure to azithromycin when it is taken over 3 days. If administered as a single 1.5 g dose, patient exposure to azithromycin is even higher; exceeding that experienced with either the 3-or 5-day regimens. Not only would single dose administration of azithromycin potentially lead to more favorable outcomes due to higher systemic exposures but it also has the potential to achieve as close to perfect patient compliance as is possible. Single-dose azithromycin was approved for the treatment of childhood otitis media in 2003 after studies demonstrated equal safety and efficacy versus standard comparators such as amoxicillin/clavulanate and ceftriaxone. In these studies, single-dose azithromycin was found to be associated with significantly higher compliance (vs amoxicillin/ clavulanate) and to have a clinical cure rate higher than if the same azithromycin dose was split over 3 days or compared to ceftriaxone. When the same concept has been applied to adults with community-acquired pneumonia, two studies to date have demonstrated equivalent safety and efficacy of a single 1.5 g dose vs the dose spread over 3-days or a comparable comparator such as 10 days of clarithromycin. The single-dose has also been shown to be efficacious in a small study of adults with uncomplicated tonsillitis. Based on these results, it appears that administering single oral doses of azithromycin is a safe and effective option for a variety of adult and pediatric respiratory tract infections, though further study of the concept is warranted. Expansion of these studies to the use of single intravenous azithromycin doses for the treatment of hospitalised patients with community-acquired respiratory infections should also be considered.",

Usual defervescence of fever does not occur as in other patients, particularly not in mechanically ventilated patients. We evaluated 30 consecutive patients with community acquired pneumonia admitted in the ICU. Initial therapy was azithromycin intravenously for seven days plus beta-lactams (ceftriaxon or penicillin). Switch to oral treatment was possible after defervescence of fever. Treatment was finished as planned in 25 patients. In five patients it was stopped because of early therapeutic failure, isolation of resistant pathogens or adverse drug event. However, in 10/25 patients which completed planned treatment additional antibiotics were added despite improvement of pneumonia because of suspected or confirmed nosocomial infection. Treatment beta-lactams plus azithromycin was successful in 21 patients. Analysis of duration of fever in survivors showed that only in one patient defervescence of fever occurred after three days of treatment. Our results suggest that randomized clinical studies do not show exact clinical efficacy of antibiotics, as observational studies do, due to the selection of patients, even with severe pneumonia. Evaluation of treatment effect should be based more on meticulous estimation of respiratory function than on parameters representing systemic inflammatory response or x-ray findings.",

Better understanding of pathophysiology of infection has brought up interest in pharmacokinetics of antimicrobials and relationship between PK and clinical outcome. As opposed to previous standpoint today antimicrobials are divided in two different cathegories, namely, concentrations dependent and time dependent killing. However, this division into two groups seems not to apply in total since certain groups of antimicrobials such as azithromycin, tetracyclines are somewhere in between. Time over the minimal inhibitory concentration with azithromycin and doxycycline has to be disregarded or minimized since the persistent effects are better represented by AUC24/MIC. This is especially relevant for intracellular microorganisms. Cellular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin makes the time over the MIC irrelevant since accumulation of the azithromycin intracellulary provides concentration well above MIC for period much longer than 24 hours. However, this is not the case with other macrolides. In defining relationship between PK and outcome one has to take into account the type of infection. In infections caused by intracellular microorganisms cellular PK of antimicrobial is essential, while in blood stream infections extracellular PK is important and defines the outcome of infection providing that activity against the causative agent is present. However, increasing the dosing of azithromycin is likely to enhance the microbiologic outcome especially in infections like acute otitis media (OAM) caused by extracellular microorganisms such as non-typeable Haemophylus influenzae (NTHI). Results from in vivo infection models and clinical trials indicate that for azithromycin 24 hour AUC/MIC ratio of 25 is associated with treatment efficacy.",

Decisions concerning proper antimicrobial therapy are guided by several considerations such as spectrum of activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy in clinical trials, Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 safety profile, and cost effectiveness. Because the azithromycin is active against the key pathogens of CAP, it is particularly useful to treat patients-either as monotherapy for mild infections or as part of combination therapy with a beta-lactam for serious infections. While numerous randomized clinical trials have documented the efficacy of azithromycin for the treatment of CAP from the standpoint of clinical and bacteriological endpoints, studies have also demonstrated 'other' benefits of this antimicrobial. Such benefits include: shorter dosing duration; excellent safety profile; decreased length of stay in the hospital; and cost-effectiveness. The unique PK properties of azithromycin, which include prolonged T1/2 and excellent respiratory tract penetration, allow for the reduced dosing regimens. This has several advantages that include better compliance, reduced adverse events, quicker change from IV to po therapy in hospitalized patients, and reduced costs. Several studies have demonstrated an advantage of azithromycin, when used as monotherapy in selected patients, as compared to other antimicrobials concerning the length of stay within the hospital. In a pharmacoeconomic study, Paladino et al. found that azithromycin was more cost-effective as empiric therapy for low-risk patients hospitalized with CAP compared to cefuroxime with or without erythromycin. In addition, several studies have found that use of a macrolide, such as azithromycin, which is part of an initial combination therapy for patients hospitalised with CAP is associated with decreased mortality or shorter hospital stay than with a cephalosporin alone. The specific aetiology of infection was not determined in these studies, however it is possible that the added coverage for 'atypical' pathogens may in part explain this observation. Additional retrospective studies suggest the benefit of this combination therapy applies not only to CAP in general but also to CAP specifically associated with S. pneumoniae bacteraemia. The possible coexistence of atypical pathogens or the immunomodulating effect of the macrolides may in part be responsible for this finding.",

            "text": "In vitro studies on interferon-inducing capacity and sensitivity to IFN of human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Objectives: No fully effective antiviral treatment are currently available against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCOV) infection. In this study, we investigated whether interferons (IFNs), used alone and in combination, exhibit in vitro anti-SCOV activity. In parallel experiments we examined the capacity of SCOV to induce human IFN alpha from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy donors. Methods: Anti-SCOV (Hsr1 strain) or anti-EMC/VSV/NDV activities of IFN alpha, beta and gamma were determined by using CPE inhibition test in epithelial kidney monkey Vero cell culture. Synergistic, additive or antagonistic interactions between IFNs were evaluated using the combination index analysis method developed by Chou & Talalay. Analysis of transcript levels for a series of IFN alpha (1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 17, 21) genes were determined by Real Time PCR. Antiviral activity of IFN secreted from PBMCs after incubation of SCOV were determined by an EMC assay performed in A549 cell line. Results: All the tested IFNs showed anti-SARS virus activities on Vero cell culture but at different extent. Specifically the results showed that, compared to EMC/VSV/NDV, SCOV grown in Vero cell can be only moderately inhibited by pretreatment with IFN beta. IFN alpha and above all IFN gamma, by contrast, were less effective. We have however found that IFN gamma synergizes with the innate IFNs (IFN alpha and beta) to potently inhibit SCOV replication in vitro. Interestingly incubation of PBMCs with SCOV leads to early and strong IFN alpha mRNA synthesis. IFNs secreted from PBMCs after SCOV stimulation possesses antiviral activity in vitro. Conclusions: The data document the synergistic antiviral activity of innate IFNs and IFN gamma to an extent that may be compatible with clinical use for SARS prevention and therapy. Moreover since IFNs are normally produced in the first phase of viral infections, it could be important to understand whether and to what extent the relative low sensitivity of SCOV to IFNs associated to its ability to induce the production of IFN alpha may have any relevance in determining the course of infection. Objectives: To characterize and analyze the complete genome of a novel coronavirus, coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1), from patients with pneumonia. Methods: We amplified a 440-bp fragment of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (pol)gene of coronaviruses by RT-PCR, using coronavirus conserved primers, from RNA extracted from the nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) of a 71-year old Chinese man with pneumonia. The complete genome of the coronavirus (CoV-HKU1) was amplified and sequenced using RNA extracted from the NPA as template and degenerate primers designed by multiple alignment of the genomes of other group 2 coronaviruses. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed to quantify the amount of virus in the NPA obtained in the first to the fifth week of the illness. Specific antibody was detected by Western blot assay and ELISA using recombinant nucleocapsid of CoV-HKU1. Screening for CoVHKU1 on NPA obtained during the SARS period was carried out by RT-PCR. Results: RT-PCR and sequencing of the 440-bp fragment of the pol gene showed that there were 89-91% amino acid identity between the sequence of the fragment and those of other group 2 coronaviruses. The genome of CoV-HKU1 is a 29926-nucleotide, polyadenylated RNA. The G + C content is 32%, the lowest among all known coronaviruses with available genome sequence. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that CoVHKU1 is a new group 2 coronavirus. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the amount of CoV-HKU1 RNA were 8.5 to 9.6 \u00b7 10 6 copies per ml in his NPA during the first week of the illness and dropped progressively to undetectable levels in subsequent weeks.",

Cultural, antigenic, RNA, or serological detection of other microbial pathogens were negative. Screening of 400 NPA collected during the SARS period identified the presence of CoV-HKU1 RNA in one specimen, with a viral load of 1.13 \u00b7 10 6 copies per ml, from a 35-year old woman with pneumonia. Conclusion: Our data support the existence of a novel group 2 coronavirus in the NPA of patients with pneumonia. Resolution of the illness in the index patient was associated with the disappearance of the viral RNA and the development of specific IgG and IgM antibody response against the virus. Objectives: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) belongs to the genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family and causes a potentially fatal disease, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is characterised by hemorrhage and fever. Previously, CCHF cases have been reported in Turkey. An outbreak of CCHF occurred in the Central Anatolian region of Turkey during April and October 2004. We report herein 92 cases who diagnosed as CCHF during the outbreak. Methods: Patients with acute febrile syndrome characterized by malaise, bleeding, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia were admitted to our hospital (Cumhuriyet University Hospital, an 800-bed teaching hospital in Sivas city, located in the Central Anatolian region of Turkey) during the spring and summer of 2004. Patients who had IgM antibodies or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results positive for CCHFV in serum samples were included. Obtained serum samples from all patients both acute-and convalescent-phase of the illness were sent to the World Health Organisation (WHO) reference laboratories in Lyon, France, and London, England to test for the presence of CCHF virus. Results: Ninety-two patients had immunoglobulin M antibodies and/or PCR results positive for CCHFV in serum samples during the outbreak. Forty-three (47%) were female and 49 (53%) were male. The mean age was 45.7 \u00b1 2.2 (range 5-92 years). Malaise (94%), fever (91%) and muscle ache (90%) were the most common presenting symptoms, rash (57%) and conjunctival injection (50%) were the most common initial clinical findings among the patients. Forty-two per cent of patients had history of tick bite, and 80% of handling livestock. Complete blood counts at admittance showed thrombocytopenia in all patients leukopenia in 69 (75%), anaemia in 11 (12%) of 92 patients. Elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were determined in 84 (91.3%), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 73 (79%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in 91 (98.9%) of 92 patients. Eightyseven (95%) patients were treated with oral ribavirin. Six patients, died during the outbreak, 3 of them died because of bleeding. The overall mortality was 6.5%. Conclusion: Herein we report an outbreak of CCHF in the central Anatolian of Turkey. Our CCHF cases had lower mortality rate. It could be explained by early defining of the disease during the outbreak, supportive therapy and ribavirin treatment. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus is the type species of the genus Nairovirus, family Bunyaviridae. CCHF virus is a spherical, enveloped virus with a single-stranded, tripartite RNA genome of negative polarity. Objectives: The goal of this work was to establish L segment sequences of CCHF virus laboratory isolates representative of strains circulating in European Russia and Asia, and to compare these sequences with partial or full-length CCHF virus L segment sequences from Nigeria, Pakistan, and Iraq. Materials and methods: Two laboratory-adapted CCHF virus strains were used in this work. After total RNA extraction using the RNeasy MiniKit (QIAGENE, Germany) RT-PCR was performed using the Access RT-PCR kit (-Dromega, USA). The goal of primer selection and design was to produce overlapping amplicons of 350-700 nucleotides spanning the entire L segment. Fragments were purified from 1% agarose gel using the Q-Biogene GeneClean extraction kit and directly sequenced using CEQ 2000 DTCS kit run on the CEQ 2000XL DNA Analysis System. Results: The large (L) segment CCHF virus strain ASTR/ TI30908 was amplified and sequenced. After removal of the 5' and 3' primer-generated ends, this L segment sequence is 12112 nucleotides long, and is 97% identical at the translated amino acid level to partial or full-length CCHF virus L segment sequences currently published or available in GenBank A complete L segment coding-region sequence for CCHF virus strain TADJ/HU8966 was also determined. The 30908 RdRp ORF shares 90% nt identity with IbAr10200 and 87% nt identity with Matin. In RdRp ORF we identified a variable region, approximately 50-aa, corresponding to nt positions 2346-2513 in 30908, which is flanked by well-conserved regions. Discussion: This variable region serves a very useful practical purpose for both diagnostics and phylogenetic analysis, in that the flanking conserved regions could be used for to design amplification primers useful for any CCHF virus, while the internal variable region sequence, provided it is variable enough, can be used for classification and molecular epidemiology. Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 of the patients were male. The age, gender, and days from symptoms to admission were similar between survived and died patients (p > 0.05). Among the clinical findings, hematemesis (p = 0.009), melena (p = 0.001), and somnolence (p = 0.022) were significantly more common among died patients. The rate of the other symptoms and signs such as nausea-vomiting, diarrhoea, and maculopapular rash were similar in both groups. Among died cases, the median platelet count was significantly lower (10 600/ml versus 20 000/ml, p = 0.038), mean prothrombin time (27 sec vs 16 sec, p = 0.002), and mean activated partial thromboplastin time were longer (73 sec vs 44 sec, p < 0.001), and the mean ALT (1125 vs 331, p \u00a3 0.001), and mean AST (3118 vs 913, p = 0.004) were higher. Serum IgM and IgG positivity against CCHF virus was detected in 33% and 0% of died cases, whereas 93% and 68% of survived cases, respectively. PCR positivity was detected in 100% of died cases. Twenty-five patients (46%) were intended to be given per oral ribavirin, but 3 among these couldn't get the drug because of gastrointestinal bleeding and somnolence. These three patients and the one who did not get ribavirin died. Conclusion: The lack of antibody production against CCHF virus infection was observed as a strong indicator of mortality. Gastrointestinal bleeding and somnolence could be the reason for the ineffectiveness of oral ribavirin. Intravenous ribavirin should be given to the severe cases. Background: Mannan Binding Lectin (MBL) is a C-type serum lectin produced by the liver and involved in innate immune response. Low level serum MBL concentration constitutes a risk factor for infection in pts receiving myelo-suppressive chemotherapy. Substitutive therapy methods are under development and will be tested in the future. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study focusing on assessment of MBL as a risk factor for infection. All pts with haematological malignancy hospitalized for administration of at least one chemotherapy cycle, between December 2001 through December 2003 were eligible for the study. Serum MBL concentration was measured by a Time Resolved Immune Fluoro-Metric Assay method. Deficiency was defined using serum MBL levels or MBL genotypes according to a pre-defined algorithm. Outcomes considered included the occurrence of febrile (N), severe infection (sepsis, pneumonia, bacteraemia or invasive fungal infection), bacteraemia, and the time to first development of one of these outcomes, from enrollment and across the cumulative cycles for each patient. We used logistic regression models for analyzing binary outcomes (and Fisher exact tests); Kaplan-Meier estimates and logrank tests for analyzing time to event variables Results: 255 pts who received 569 cycles of chemotherapy were analyzed with a median number of received chemotherapy cycles of 1. Median number of days of (N) per cycle was 7 days (inter-quartile range 0-13).62 pts (24%) were considered as MBL deficient. 200 pts developed, at least once, febrile (N). No difference in the occurrence of febrile (N) per cycle or per pt between deficient and non deficient pts was observed. On pt-based analysis, there was a rate of severe infections in MBL deficient pts (1.96 per 100 days versus 1.34 per 100 days, p = 0.008) on the overall group of pts; this impact was even increased on the subgroup obtained by excluding acute leukaemic pts. On cycle-based analysis, MBL deficiency was associated with a trend to a higher rate of severe infection (13/72 (18%) vs 20/194 (10%); OR 1.92 [95%CI 0.90-4.09]; p = 0.09), excluding pts with acute leukemia's and BMT pts. On that subgroup, MBL deficiency was also associated with a greater rate of bacteraemia (14% versus 5%, p = 0.01). Conclusion: These results show that MBL deficiency is associated with earlier and more severe infections in adult haematological cancer pts with chemotherapy-induced(N). The association was strengthened when acute leukaemic pts were excluded from the analysis Background: Since the late 1980s, fluoroquinolone (FQ) prophylaxis is often used to reduce the incidence of G-infections in neutropenic cancer patients. However, while it is unclear whether it reduces morbidity and mortality, FQ prophylaxis has been associated with the emergence of FQ-resistant G-. Therefore this preventive measure was promptly discontinued in our hospital. Yet, investigators have argued about the appropriateness of stopping prophylaxis in light of recent reports of high mortality of G-infection among patients not receiving FQ (ICAAC 2004 Abstract K-1436). Objectives: To assess the morbidity and mortality of G-infections in high-risk neutropenic inpatients with haematological malignancies not receiving FQ prophylaxis. respectively, CDI in 74 (36%), and FUO in 65 (31%) of the FE. Among 56 bacterial bloodstream isolates, 29 (52%) were G-(E.coli 10, Klebsiella 9, Pseudomonas 1, other 9) and 27 (48%) G+ (CNS 14, streptococci 7, other 6). Empirical antibacterial treatment was appropriate according to susceptibility testing in 26/29 (90%) G-(3 E. coli ESBL) and in 17/27 (63%) G+. Severe sepsis occurred in 5/208 (2%) FE (1 E.coli ESBL bacteraemia, 3 CDI, 1 FUO), and septic shock was not observed. Overall in-hospital mortality in the entire study population was 0%. Conclusion: Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 50% of bloodstream infections in high-risk febrile neutropenic patients not receiving fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. However Gramnegative infections were associated with low morbidity and zero mortality arguing against the need for prophylaxis in high-risk hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies. Database. Mortality within 30 days was determined through the Central Population Registry. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to compare mortality rates between the major groups of haematological malignancies using acute myeloid leukemia as reference and between Grampositive (reference group), Gram-negative, and polymicrobial bacteraemia or fungaemia. We adjusted for age, gender, comorbidity, calendar time, and whether or not the empiric antibiotic therapy was appropriate. Results: In total 1666 patients were registered with a new haematological malignancy and 358 (21%) of these had a successive episode of bacteraemia yielding an incidence rate on 96 bacteremias per 1000 person years. Overall 30-days cumulative mortality rate was 0.32 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27-0.37). Compared with acute myeloid leukemia the adjusted mortality rate ratios (MRR) for 30 days of follow-up were for Hodgkin's disease 1.3 (95% CI: 0.3-4.2), for multiple myeloma 1.0 (95% CI: 0.5-1.9), and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia 0.7 (95% CI: 0.4-1.1). Gram-positive organisms caused 35% and Gram-negative organisms 50% of the bacteremias. Fifteen % were polymicrobial or caused by yeasts. Gram-negative bacteremias did not have a substantially increased risk compared with Gram positive bacteremias (adjusted MRR 1.1 (95% CI: 0.7-1.6)). Adjusted MRR for polymicrobial bacteremias or fungaemias compared with Gram-positive bacteremias was 2.4 (95% CI: 1. Background: Bacterial infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality among neutropenic cancer patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis has been shown to reduce bacterial infections but not overall mortality, thus current guidelines do not advise its use. Methods: Systematic compilation of all randomised trials comparing antibiotic prophylaxis vs. no prophylaxis; and different types of prophylaxis. The search included Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, conference proceedings and all references. No date, language, age or publication limits were imposed. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Meta-analyses were performed for each comparison. Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the fixed effect model. , systemic antibiotics were superior to nonabsorbables, quinolones were superior to TMP-SMZ, and additional antibiotics directed against gram-positive bacteria (GP) did not enhance efficacy of quinolones alone (table). In trials in which quinolones were compared to TMP-SMZ, less resistance developed to quinolones in the quinolone arm than to TMP-SMZ in the TMP-SMZ arm, RR0.45 (0.27-0.74). Quinolone efficacy was not associated with study years. Most trials included adults with haematological malignancies (64 trials were restricted to haematological cancer patients). Nine trials included >80% patients with solid tumors. Prophylaxis was given for up to 6 weeks.",

Risk factors for the acquisition of infections due to these isolates included admission to intensive care units, recent surgery, urinary catheterization, prolonged hospitalization and previous beta-lactam and/or aminoglycoside exposure. Nowadays, an outburst of ESBL producing isolates, mainly E. coli with different CTX-M variants, has been recognized in the community.

These microbes are enclosed in an extracellular matrix and are organized in complex communities with structural and functional heterogeneity, resembling multicellular organisms. Existence within a biofilm represents a basic survival mechanism by which microbes resist against external (antimicrobial agents) and internal environmental factors (host immune system).",

            "text": "Challenge: Depletion of metabolic substances or waste product accumulation in biofilms causes microbes to enter a slow-or nongrowing (stationary) state, in which they are less susceptible to growth-dependent antimicrobial agents. These characteristics make biofilm microbes not only more resistant to antimicrobial killing as compared to planktonic bacteria, but also more difficult to detect. As a consequence, implant-associated infections are often difficult to diagnose with routine microbiological methods. Routine diagnostic methods: Increased synovial fluid cell count and presence of acute inflammation in periprosthetic tissue correlate well with infection, however, the causing microorganism cannot be identified with this method. Gram staining has usually a low sensitivity. Periprosthetic tissue and synovial fluid cultures are frequently used as the reference standard for diagnosing infection, however, they do not have an ideal sensitivity and specificity. New diagnostic methods directed to identify microbes in biofilms are needed. Potential new methods: By dispersing adherent bacteria from the surface and disrupting their multicellular structure, the recovery efficiency of diagnostic assays may be increased. Various potential strategies to dislodge microbial biofilms from surfaces have been used in research setting, including mechanical (sonication, vortexing, shock waves), biochemical (enzyme treatment), and electrical approaches. To date, mostly ultrasound has been studied for improvement of recovery of biofilm microbes. In addition, cultures may be false-negative because of prior antimicrobial exposure, a low number of organisms, inappropriate culture media, or fastidious or atypical organisms. Therefore, molecular (culture-independent) methods may be used to improve the diagnosis of infection, for example broad-range 16S rDNA PCR.",

            "text": "Foreign body infections continue to challenge current diagnostic and therapeutic options. Orthopedic device related infections (ODRI) such as hip prostheses or fixation devices poorly respond to antimicrobial therapy and frequently require removal to cure the infection. Routine susceptibility testing do not predict cure. However, susceptibility testing against stationary-phase and adherent bacteria correlated well with the outcome in the ODRI guinea-pig animal model (Widmer AF. JID 1990). Representative pathogens have been tested from patients suffering from ODRI, and were treated according to a standard regimen (Zimmerli W. NEJM 2004). Data from patients were generated by full chart review from patients hospitalized between 1994-2003. Strains were tested with standard MIC, MBCs against bacteria in logarithmic and stationary phase of growth. Early ODRIs defined as signs and/or symptoms of infection not longer than 1-3 months can be cured without removal of the device, given the antibiotic is active against the pathogen even in these sophisticated tests, an appropriate debridement is performed and treatment duration is prolonged to 3-6 months. Multiresistant pathogens in ODRIs are a new challenge: Their treatment regimens remains poorly defined, and removal of the device is deemed necessary because sufficient evidence by in-vitro and in-vivo tests are still lacking. Methods: BDV infection is detectable in blood. Plasma samples were investigated for BDV-specific immune complexes (BDV-CIC) by novel ELISA tests which use two monoclonal antibodies against the major antigens (proteins N and P). BDV-CIC are formed after periods of virus activity with antigenaemia and subsequent antibody formation. Results: BDV is an unique negative stranded RNA virus targeting the limbic system of the brain. Its broad host spectrum covers humans and companion animals. In animals, behavioural and developmental brain disorders are confirmed. A world-wide impact of BDV on human mental health has been suggested in the mid 1990s, when psychiatric patients' infections were confirmed by RNA /proteins in blood cells. New infection markers, namely BDV-CIC, estimated a fairly high BDV prevalence in healthy adults (20-30%) vs. 90% in depressed subjects. This multi-centre study for the first time unravels the prevalence of BDV-CIC through randomised cohorts of children in two European countries. German cohorts included healthy and diseased children (various diagnosis) (n = 770; 0-18 years) in Saxony, Italian cohorts focused on healthy children only (n = 1224; 0-15 years), but covered eight regions of residence. In both countries, an unexpectedly high but congruent mean prevalence of 60% was found, double as high as shown in healthy adults. More intriguingly, the age-dependent frequencies were congruently peaking in early childhood (D:1-3 and I:1-5 years), reaching 85% (one region, D) and 75% (mean of regions, Italy). In addition, the Italian cohorts revealed dramatic regional differences. Table 1 ). When including the cross-reactive serotypes 6A and 19A the theoretical vaccine coverage increased to 66%. The 114 isolates represented 53 different genotypes, and 71% of these isolates belonged to 20 distinct genetic clusters. The most important cluster represented 15 isolates of serotype 23F. These isolates, which were invariably found in Pedernales, were genetically identical to the RFEL type 4 that was present in the Dutch RFEL data library. Two genetically closely related RFEL clusters representing 18 serotype 6A isolates were found in all the communities studied. The latter two genotypes were not present in the reference data libraries. Conclusions: Representatives of 6 internationally disseminated clones were found among invasive isolates recovered from children <6 years old, accounting for 91.6% of the penicillin nonsusceptible isolates. The most frequent lineages were related to Spain9V-3 (23.2%) and Colombia23F-26 (14.6%). This study provides a baseline for detecting potential effects of the use of the 7-valent conjugated vaccine on the distribution of individual genetic lineages within this population.",

            "text": "Methods: Between 1998 and 2003, 557 non-replicate MRSAstrains were collected from staff and patients admitted to M\u00fc nster University Hospital (1480 beds), Germany. Of these strains, the DNA sequence of the repeat-region of the S. aureus protein A gene (spa) was analyzed by the Ridom StaphType software v2.0 beta. Different early-warning algorithms (frequency and clonal alerts, infection control professionals [ICP], Z-score) were evaluated for the year 2003 using spa typing results and epidemiological data. Outbreaks were detected on the level of minimally two MRSA-colonized orinfected patients or staff on the same or related nursing units exhibiting the same spa type within a two-week time window. Results: 549 of 557 MRSAs were typeable by spa sequencing. In total, 79 different spa types were identified. Retrospectively analyzed, 42 of the overall 175 MRSA isolates formed 13 significant clonal outbreaks in 2003 (scantest, 5% significance level). These outbreaks were used as gold standard to evaluate the different algorithms in a prospective simulation. 100% sensitivity and 95.2% specificity for outbreak detection were reached using the combination of spa typing and epidemiological data (place and time). All other methods were less sensitive or less specific: using solely epidemiological data (frequency alert) resulted in 100% sensitivity and 47.3% specificity, whereas investigations of the ICP resulted in 62.1% sensitivity and 97.3% specificity, respectively. Conclusion: A surveillance method based on both epidemiological and spa typing data gives infection-control professionals opportunities to intervene before limited clusters of preventable MRSA transmissions become expansive outbreaks. This innovative combined use of medical informatics and molecular laboratory technique provides a vision for future innovations that can expand our capacity to detect and treat clusters of infectious diseases, thus limiting their spread and improving the patients' safety. can lead to serious treatment difficulties since the MRSAs are resistant to all betalactam antibiotics and often also to other groups of antibiotics. Furthermore, patients with MRSA need to be isolated during hospitalization. In order to study the epidemiological relatedness of the MRSA isolates and potentially discover routes of transmission we selected a number of genes for typing by PCR and/or DNA sequencing. Methods: 115 MRSA isolates from 2003 and 2004 were analyzed. The genes or gene clusters chosen for analysis were the following: the variable repeat region of the staphylococcus protein A gene (spa typing), the Staphylococcal Chromosomal Cassette (SCCmec typing), the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of all novel spa types. Results: One dominant spa type, t024 (SCCmecIV, PVL-, ST8), was found in 50 of the MRSA isolates (43 %) and was clearly associated with nursing homes. This spa type was also predominant during the MRSA outbreaks in Denmark in the 1960's. 15 isolates (13 %) were t019 (SCCmecIV, PVL+, ST30). ST30 is known as the CA-MRSA from Oceania, and all of these patients came from or had a connection to the same Asian country. spa type t044 (SCCmecIV, PVL+, ST80) was found in 9 isolates. ST80 is the most common CA-MRSA in Europe. spa type t008 (SCCmecIV, PVL+, ST8) was found in 7 and t002 (ST5) in 5 isolates. Of the remaining 28 patients with sporadic MRSA clones, 12 had acquired the MRSA in a foreign country. Conclusions: MRSA is spreading in Denmark, primarily in the community, but these patients are often hospitalized with the risk of nosocomial spread. Most isolates carry the SCCmecIV. A clear connection to other countries can be found for several minor or sporadic clones. However, the most dominant MRSA clone, spa type t024, seems to be related to the archaic clone common in Denmark in the 1960's and 1970's.",

            "text": "Rapid, reliable sub-typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus by denaturing high pressure liquid chromatography and DNA sequence analysis Objectives: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a significant cause of hospital and community acquired disease. Epidemic MRSA (EMRSA)strains are particularly successful pathogens able to spread rapidly. Detection and sub-typing of EMRSA can require a week of investigation. To be of true use, methods for identification of cross-infection events and outbreaks need to be highly discriminatory and easy to perform. The current methods for this purpose have numerous disadvantages including expense and a lack of standardisation and rapidity. Characterisation of the X region of the spaA gene provides a rapid, unambiguous, discriminatory sub-typing method that can inform outbreak investigation. Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) is a powerful technique for separation and quantitation of nucleic acids. We have used DHPLC to detect DNA sequence variation within the spaA gene of 32 samples to fully investigate the application of DHPLC approaches as a possible rapid and cheap alternative to spa typing by conventional methods. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from cultured isolates and used as template in PCR to amplify the X region of the spaA gene. DHPLC was carried out by Transgenomic WAVE TM DNA fragment analysis. PCR products were screened for size variation by running 5 ll of each PCR sample through a linear acetonitrile gradient. The samples were run blindly so no prior assumptions could be made of the EMRSA type. Retention times were collected for each sample and comparisons to a size standard (pUC18 Haelll digest) were made. The number of repeat units for each sample was calculated. Sequence data were also obtained for each of the samples. Results: Sequence data indicated a predominance of strains with 15 (n = 13; group A) or 16 (n = 8; group B) repeat units in the spaA X region. With the exception of a repeat unit that was inserted as the sixth unit in group B isolates, the succession of repeat units in group A strains was identical to that seen in those of group B. The number of repeat units in each sample matched exactly those predicted by WAVE TM analysis. Conclusion: DHPLC methods can rapidly detect repeat unit number with a very high correlation to sequence data. This indicates the ability of the WAVE to rapidly sub-type strains of MRSA, which differ by a single repeat unit. Expansion of the predominant repeat unit succession, by insertion of a new repeat unit, suggests possible local evolution of the spaA X region. Objectives: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a significant cause of nosocomial morbidity and mortality with increasing reports of multiple-resistant (MR) hospital acquired (HA) strains and an emerging problem of community acquired (CA) infections. The objective of this study was to compare random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for the characterisation of MRSA and to assess the suitability of RAPD as a typing technique in an infection control setting. Methods: A total of 129 MRSA isolates were typed: 28 MR-MRSA isolates (only sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline and rifampicin), 66 HA-MRSA isolates from the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust, UK, (UHB) and 35 CA-MRSA isolates sent to the UHB by general practitioners in the Birmingham area. The RAPD reaction consisted of two separate reactions for which two arbitrary 10mer primers (designated s and l) were used and was optimised and tested for reproducibility, typability and discrimination. PFGE was performed following SmaI macrorestriction. Profile relatedness was calculated by the Dice coefficient and a dendrogram was constructed using UPGMA clustering. Results: PFGE analysis revealed 30 profiles, type B (26 isolates) and type J (2 isolates) representing two MR-MRSA strains and type A (31 isolates) and type C (17 isolates) representing strains that shared the same genotype as the EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16 respectively. All CA-MRSA strains shared the same genotype with 1 or more of the HA-MRSA strains excluding 9 CA-MRSA strains, which had unique PFGE profiles. RAPD analysis revealed ten profiles, type B(sl) (45 isolates) representing strains that shared the same genotype as EMRSA-16 and the MR-MRSA strains and type A(sl) (74 isolates) representing strains that shared the same genotype as EMRSA-15. The B(sl) type was associated with a higher resistance phenotype than the A(sl) type. The discriminatory capacities of PFGE and RAPD as determined by Simpson's Index of Diversity were 88% and 58% respectively. Conclusion: This study indicates that RAPD has a limited discriminatory capacity compared to PFGE for typing of MRSA, however, RAPD was able to elicit results within a single working day and grouped all the MRSA isolates associated with a higher resistance phenotype. Such timely information is invaluable in directing appropriate infection control which is especially important in the management of MR-MRSA outbreaks. The presence of the pls gene -described to be associated with type I -was also determined. Only one MRSA isolate per patient was included. Results: Concordant results based on all methods used were found in only 59% of the isolates tested comprising MRSA strains exhibiting type I (n = 40, 52%), type II (n = 10, 13%), type III (n = 2, 3%), type IV (n = 20, 26%) and 5 nontypeable strains. All isolates tested positive for pls were shown to be type I. Regarding type I (A: n = 64, 49% [incl. type IA] versus B: n = 30, 23%) and type IV (A: n = 24, 18% versus B: n = 58, 45%) major discrepancies were detected. Using approach A, 13 (10%) and 3 (2%) MRSA strains showed type II and III (incl. IIIA), respectively, whereas method B yielded 15 (12%) and 7 (5%) type II and III, respectively, results. 26 isolates were not typeable using method A as were 30 isolates applying method B (no PCR bands or uncharacteristic band patterns). Conclusions: The application of different approaches to determine the SCCmec type showed major discrepancies, in particular regarding types I and IV. As both methods failed in typing of some MRSA isolates, the structure of SCCmec may be more heterogenous than assumed so far. Antibiotics were used at concentrations ranging from 0.05 X MIC to 1000 X MIC. Antibiotic content in cell lysates was measured by microbiological (OXA, GEN), fluorimetric (MXF) or radiochemical (ORI) assay. Results: The table shows the parameters calculated from a sigmoidal regression of the concentration-effects relationships, with concentrations expressed in X MIC and the effect, as the change in CFU over 24 h, as compared to the initial inoculum (all R2 > 0.9). Extracellularly, all antibiotics reached a static effect and EC50 at a conc. close to their MIC and were highly cidal (4-5 log decrease) upon exposure to high conc. Intracellularly, OXA and MXF showed a static effect and EC50 at extracell. conc. 3-4 X those observed for extracellular bacteria, whereas conc. of approx. 10 X higher were needed for GEN and ORI. The intracellular max. effect was lower than the extracellular one for all drugs, but a cidal effect (2 log decrease) could still be achieved at clinically relevant conc. for OXA, MXF and ORI.",

We used the neutropenic murine thighinfection models to determine the magnitude of the AUC/MIC needed for efficacy of gemifloxacin (GEM) against 61 strains of SP with varing fluoroquinolone susceptibility. Methods: Mice had 10 to the 5.728.3 cfu/thigh when treated for 24 hrs with 0.073-1200 mg/kg of GEM every 12 hrs. Serial dilutions of thigh homogenate were plated for CFU determinations. A sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the dose (mg/kg/24 hr) required to achieve a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 hrs. The AUC for the static dose was estimated from serum levels following doses of 18.8, 75 and 300 mg/kg determined by microbiologic assay. Protein binding was determined by ultrafiltration. Results: PK studies exhibited AUC/dose values of 0.12-0.18 and half-lives of 0.7-1.6 hrs; protein binding was 66%. MICs ranged from 0.008-2.0 mg/L and some strains had single or multiple parC, parE and gyrA mutations. Five strains had efflux (confirmed by 4-to 16-fold lower MIC with reserpine); the free drug 24-hr AUC/MIC values for the static dose for these strains were 2.1-5.7. For the 56 other stains, the static dose varied 275fold (1.7-468 mg/kg q12h), while the free drug 24-hr AUC/MIC values for the static dose varied only 5-fold (16-82) and the mean AUC/MIC was similar at different MIC values. Conclusions: The magnitude of the 24-hr AUC/MIC of free GEM required for in vivo bacteriostasis was similar for most strains of SP with and without gyrA, parC and parE mutations. However, for strains with higher MICs due to efflux, GEM was much more active than the MIC predicted. This suggests that efflux might be down-regulated in vivo.",

The relevance of these predictions to outcomes in humans, however, has not been well studied. This study aimed at determining the probability of attaining pharmacodynamic exposures for meropenem (MEM) 500 mg every 8 hours and imipenem (IMI) 500 mg every 8 hours against pathogens isolated from complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) during a randomized, multicentre, clinical trial and comparing TA with microbiological response (MR). Methods: A subset of the clinically evaluable study population who had bacteria isolated and MICs performed for their respective randomized treatment was extracted. The MICs of these bacteria were treated as a single MIC distribution for each carbapenem. Free drug exposures for 5000 subjects were simulated using a one-compartment infusion model. Mean pharmacokinetic data and variability, including blister fluid penetration, was derived from published studies in healthy volunteers and incorporated using MCS. TA at 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% time above the MIC (T > MIC) in both serum and blister fluid was calculated for each carbapenem and compared with its MR at the end of treatment. Results: Of 548 clinically evaluable patients, 210 had bacteria with MICs reported and were included (MEM, n = 98; IMI, n = 112). MR for MEM and IMI against these pathogens was 87.8% (95% CI: 79.8-92.9) and 91.1% (95% CI: 84.3-95.1), respectively. For MEM, bactericidal TA (40% T > MIC) were 90.4 and 89.9 in serum and blister fluid and did not differ from MR. TA at all other T > MIC exposures also agreed with MR. In contrast, TA for IMI at 40% T > MIC in either matrix was not predictive of MR. Instead, only TA in serum at 60% and 70% T > MIC, and blister fluid at 50% and 60% T > MIC were similar to MR. Conclusions: For these carbapenems in the treatment of cSSSI, an association between TA calculated by MCS and MR does exist, although the exposures needed for a successful response appear to be different between MEM and IMI.",

In some cases the viruses have been infecting humans for many years, but have only recently been recognized (e.g. Sin Nombre and related viruses causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) but in other cases the virus has not previously entered the human population either because it recently emerged from a reservoir host (e.g. Nipah virus or the SARS coronavirus) or was newly introduced from a different geographic location (e.g. West Nile virus in the USA). In the case of the SARS coronavirus, sequence analysis of isolates from several different locations (Vietnam, Germany and Canada) revealed almost no sequence diversity, which is not surprising since these outbreaks could all be traced back to a single infected person in Hong Kong. Similarly, there has been little molecular variation noted in West Nile viruses isolated in the US following the single introduction from Israel to New York in 1999. However, some significant variation has recently been reported following sequencing of isolates from Mexico. It is of interest that the epidemic of haemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola virus in Kikwit, Zaire in 1995, some 19 years after a previous epidemic had occurred there, was caused by a virus with almost identical sequence. This may indicate that Ebola virus had emerged from a reservoir in which the virus is quite stable, with no pressure for sequence change.

Here, the drugs exert an effective blockade against the growing peptide chain to prevent the synthesis of new bacterial proteins. For inhibition to be effective it is essential that macrolides and ketolides attach securely to their binding site within the tunnel. The primary attachment site of all these drugs is at adenosine 2058 (A2058) in domain V of 23S rRNA. An additional interaction with domain II of the rRNA at around nucleotide A752 is made via the synthetic carbamate-alkyl-aryl substituent in the ketolide telithromycin, and contributes to telithromycin's improved activity. As a consequence of its stronger interaction, there are fewer bacterial isolates that are resistant to telithromycin compared to those resistant to the parent macrolide compound, erythromycin. However, telithromycin resistance has been noted in some strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. We have analysed the rRNA of these strains to determine the molecular mechanisms of telithromycin resistance. In this presentation, these resistance mechanisms will be compared to those found in other strains of the same genera, which are resistant to macrolides while remaining susceptible to telithromycin.",

The inducible phenotype is related to translational regulation of resistance and is characterized by dissociated resistance to MLSB antibiotics due to differences in inducing capacity of the antibiotics. In staphylococci, the strains are resistant to 14-and 15-membered ring macrolides which are inducers whereas clindamycin which is not inducer remains active. The use of clindamycin for the treatment of an infection due to an inducibly resistant strain of S. aureus may lead to the selection of constitutive mutants and therefore should be discouraged particularly in the case of infections with heavy inoculum. For the erm(B) gene, when present in streptococci, the spectrum of inducer antibiotics is broader and includes clindamycin and 16-membered macrolides. The MLSB resistance phenotype results from both the type of ribosomal methylation (mono or dimethylation) and of the type of expression of methylase (inducible or constitutive).",

            "text": "Despite the development of new b-lactams and fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides are still used for the treatment of severe infections caused by Gram-negative organisms. There are three known mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycosides in bacterial human pathogens: (i) decreased intracellular accumulation of the antibiotic by alteration of the outer membrane permeability, diminished inner membrane transport, or active efflux; (ii) modification of the target by mutation in ribosomal proteins or 16S RNA; and (iii) enzymatic modification of the drug. Micro-organisms that produce aminoglycosides have developed an additional pathway to avoid suicide: posttranscriptional methylation of rRNA by use of S-adenosyl-methionine as a cofactor. The armA (aminoglycoside resistance methylase) gene was initially found on conjugative Inc L/M plasmid pIP1204 in Klebsiella pneumoniae BM4536. Cloning of the gene in Escherichia coli conferred to the new host high-level resistance to 4,6-disubstituted deoxystreptamines (amikacin, isepamicin, gentamicin, netilmicin, sisomicin, and tobramycin) and to fortimicin by conversion of G1405 N-7 to 7-methylguanosine within 16S rRNA. Plasmid conduction experiments indicated that the armA gene was part of composite transposon Tn1548 together with genes ant3'9, sulI, and dfrXII for resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, sulfonamides, and trimethroprim, respectively. The 16.6-kb genetic element is flanked by two copies of IS6 and migrates by replicative transposition. This observation accounts for the presence of armA on self-transferable plasmids of various incompatibility groups and its already worldwide dissemination in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae from human or animal origin and in Acinetobacter baumanni. The deduced sequence of ArmA displayed from 37 to 47% similarity to those of 16S rRNA m7G methyltransferases from various actinomycetes, which confer resistance to aminoglycoside-producing strains. However, the low GC content of armA (30%) does not favor an actinomycete origin for the gene. Two other closely related 16S rRNA methylases, RmtA and RmtB, have been recently reported. It therefore appears that post-transcriptional modification of 16S rRNA can confer high-level resistance to all the clinically available aminoglycosides, except streptomycin, in Gramnegative human pathogens.",

Two antibiotic use surveillance networks, both supported by governmental funds and coordinated by physician-scientists from the University of Freiburg, are now operating in this country. One is, project SARI (Surveillance of Antibiotic Use and Resistance in Intensive Care, http://www.sari-antibiotika.de), an intensive care oriented surveillance programme similar to ICARE. The second is the MABUSE network (Medical Antibiotic Use Surveillance and Evaluation, http://www.if-freiburg.de) that aims at integrating ambulatory and hospital care antibiotic use, and resistance surveillance and research at regional levels. MABUSE projects initially included interhospital comparisons of antibiotic use and expenditures at university hospitals, and ambulatory care antibiotic use surveillance at regional level. The network has now established a hospital antibiotic use database designed for prospective data entry from selected convenience regional hospital samples. ATC/WHO DDDs are used in addition to prescribed daily doses defined according to current practice. Recent MABUSE projects include systemic antifungal use, overall (hospital and ambulatory) antibacterial drug use in selected regions, and linking drug use and resistance surveillance databases. Provided that further funds are available, projects will address a comparison of SARI/MABUSE databases with IMS databases and the definition of a suitable and representative national and regional hospital sample for drug use surveillance via quarterly online data exchange and retrieval. We will discuss our experience with the DDD versus PDD issue, appropriate drug classifications, and reasonable departmental data aggregation.",

Even a fullterm newborn is not immunocompetent and due to a high Candida colonisation rate of the mother during pregnancy, it may develop oropharyngeal candidiasis and diaper dermatitis or congenital cutaneous candidiasis. Candidaemia and disseminated candidiasis is inversely correlated with the gestational age and birth weight: Extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW) have a risk of up to 20% for developing neonatal candidiasis during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). From a recent epidemiological study conducted in Germany, 50% of ELBW infants are colonised with fungi, and from those that develop disseminated infection, the mortality rate is 30%. C. albicans is the most common isolated pathogen (70%), but 23% were non-albicans Candida spp. with C. parapsilosis the leading one. Others so far rare yeasts, such as Trichosporon and Rhodotorula spp. are as well as rare moulds emerging in neonatology. Unfortunately, in general almost 60% of the children and 90% of the newborns receive treatment with unlicensed drugs in Europe, so it's the paediatrician's choice either to prescribe a drug with high efficacy in adults that has not been tested in children or a drug with less efficacy that has been tested in children. Antifungals that are commonly used in paediatrics are conventional and liposomal amphotericin B as well as the azoles fluconazole and itraconazole due to their oral bioavailability. The new antifungals of the next generation triazoles (voriconazole, posaconazole and ravuconazole) as well as the echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin) have potentials for the paediatric population due to their broader spectrum, oral bioavailability for the azoles as well as their tolerability and excellent safety profiles. Before these drugs can be recommended in paediatrics clinical trials including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies for the different age groups are warranted. In this interactive symposium, clinical cases of neonatal candidiasis will be discussed with special regard to management, potential combinations of new and old antifungals as well as strategies for prophylaxis and empirical treatment.",

Pagano (Rome, I) CNS fungal infections are rare but fatal complications, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. The most frequent CNS manifestations, excluding cryptococcosis, are aspergillosis and zygomycosis. These infections typically present with a CNS mass, while candidiasis primarily involves the meninges. The major causes of CNS aspergillosis are acute leukemia and AHSCT. Diagnosis is usually difficult because signs and symptoms are frequently aspecific, and the diagnosis can be often performed only using aggressive procedures, which are impaired by the bad clinical conditions, particularly in patients with acute leukaemia. Treatment includes surgery (removal of abscesses or stereotactic drainage) and the use of antifungal agents. The majority of old and new antifungal drugs do not reach therapeutic levels in brain tissue. Amphotericin B (AmB), also administered at the highest tolerable doses, showed very low efficacy. The efficacy of AmB lipid compounds is higher. In particular, liposomal AmB presents a high diffusion in CNS reaching high therapeutic peak. Furthermore recent published data show that voriconazole may be highly effective for the treatment of CNS aspergillosis. Few data have been reported on combined therapy of this complication and are only based on anedoctal reports. Zygomycetes are the second frequent cause of brain abscesses. They are observed not only in patients with acute leukaemia, but also in the course of other diseases, in particular during ketoacidotic diabetes. CNS involvement is more frequent that in invasive aspergillosis, it is characterized as well by a high mortality rate. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that only posaconazole and L-AmB present some chances of success in the treatment of zygomycosis, but the pharmacological approach should always be associated to surgery. Considering the high mortality rate and the action of these antifungal drugs, the combination of L-AmB and posaconazole may represent in the future the best therapy for this complication New diagnostic methods for the laboratory Objectives: Although rare in many industrialised countries, because of the success of vaccination programmes, rubella infection in pregnancy continues to occur where uptake of the vaccine is low and in immigrants of countries with no vaccination programme. As the clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable, serological tests are needed for a diagnosis, especially in pregnancy. Diagnosis is usually made by detection of rubella specific immunoglobulin M (IgM).",

The measurement of the avidity of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies has been shown by several investigators to be helpful in identifying or excluding primary rubella infections in pregnant women. Method: In this study, we adapted this serological technique to the VIDAS system (bioMerieux) using 6 M urea as the dissociating agent. A total of 301 serum specimens were tested: 35 control sera, 50 specimens from women with acute infection, 51 serum samples from women with recent vaccination, 100 serum samples with long persisting IgM, 5 sequential sera from a woman with preconceptional vaccination, 10 sera from women with reinfection in pregnancy after vaccination, and 50 serum samples without IgM from women with past infection or vaccination.

Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an important cause of morbidity in solid organ recipients. Early markers to identify infection progress are required in order to apply a strategy of pre-emptive therapy whose efficacy relies on accurate laboratory tests to monitor CMV infection. The pp65antigen test (antigenaemia) is the gold standard for the early identification of CMV infection but the technique is timeconsuming with some pitfalls like long hands-on time and the need of a strong experience for the interpretation of the result. The evaluation of CMV DNA by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) has been introduced for monitoring CMV infection but standardization of the techniques is essential for the clinical interpretation of its results. The recently introduced real-time PCR (RT-PCR) is aimed to offer a more reliable and standardized method than the end-point PCR (EP-PCR) for evaluating CMV dynamic. Specific aim: The aim of the study was to compare the pp65antigenaemia with two PCR systems working on peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL): the EP Cobas Amplicor Monitor (Roche, Brachburg, NY, US, detection limit: 100 copies/1 milion PBL) and the RT-PCR CMV (Amplimedical, Buttigliera, To, I, detection limit 100 copies/500,000 PBL). PCR results were referred as Log10/genome/500,000 cells. PBL (n = 158) from 32 solid organ transplanted patients (pts) with CMV infection (20/32 pre-emptive treated with ganciclovir and 12/32 not on therapy due level of pp65 < 30/200,000 PBL) were studied. A pannel of 58 negative specimens by a reference nested-PCR test (10 copies/500,000 PBL) was used to establish the specificity of the EP-and RT-PCRs.",

Moreover, the found sensitivities of 70% and 77%, respectively, will most likely improve if acute-phase sera are analysed; as will be the case if the ELISA is to be employed for diagnosis. The ELISA was not able to discriminate between infections caused by Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium, and crossreactions to other bacteria were observed as well. An improvement of the specificity could possibly be achieved by changing the antigen from re-polymerized flagella to monoclonal flagellin fragments.

Given that the majority of human listeriosis cases are associated with consumption of contaminated food, the ability of Listeria monocytogenes to survive during gastrointestinal passage is fundamental to disease transmission. Objectives: To identify the molecular mechanisms underpinning listerial growth and survival in the upper small intestine. Methods: Pre-genome mutational analysis, using transposon (Tn917) and suicide plasmid (pORI19) approaches, based on functionality, coupled with post-genomic in silico analysis of the complete genome sequence, to identify potentially important loci, based on homology. Results: On entering the upper small intestine Listeria first encounter an osmotic challenge, equivalent to 0.3 M NaCl (~twice the osmolarity of the blood). Further along the intestinal tract the liver secretes up to a litre of the 'biological detergent' bile into the duodenum each day, representing an additional serious challenge to the pathogen. We identified three gene systems in L. monocytogenes which contribute to gastrointestinal persistence and virulence by allowing the bacterium to evade these stresses. Firstly, OpuC, a membrane transporter, facilitates the uptake of carnitine, an osmoprotective compound which allows the bacterium to overcome the osmotic challenge. Resistance to bile on the other hand is achieved initially by excluding the detergent from the bacterial cell and subsequently, if this defence is breached, by detoxifying internalised bile. We identified two bile resistance mechanisms; BilE which functions as a bile exclusion system, and BSH a bile salt hydrolase which degrades internalised bile. Furthermore we reveal that all three systems are co-ordinately regulated by the alternative stress related transcriptional factor SigB, and PrfA the master regulator of virulence potential in L. monocytogenes.",

Background: A gastroenteritis outbreak affecting a total of 92 military personnel who attended a dinner function was detected in January 2004. Objective: The objective of the investigation was to determine the cause of the outbreak and to institute appropriate preventive measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the organization. Methods: The investigation consisted of epidemiological, laboratory and public health sanitation investigations. Epidemiological investigation included case definition formulation, case identification, contact tracing, active case surveillance, a case-control survey using a self-administered structured questionnaire and statistical analysis of the survey results. Laboratory investigation comprised of analysis for enteric bacterial and viral pathogens using culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. 9 stool samples were obtained from amongst the affected patients. 4 of these samples were sent for stool culture for Salmonella, Shigella and Vibrio spp. 5 of the samples were sent for PCR analysis for Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahemolyticus, Shigella spp and Norovirus. Public health sanitation investigations involved environmental inspection and hygiene practices auditing. Results: 92 cases were identified out of approximately 500 participants (~18.4%) of the dinner function. The predominant symptoms among the cases were diarrhoea (92%), vomiting (80%) and fever (71%). The median onset of the symptoms was 28.5 hours from the time of the dinner function. Consumption of raw oysters was found to be significantly associated with illness (p < 0.001). All the stool cultures were found to be negative. PCR analysis of the 5 samples were negative for Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahemolyticus, Shigella spp. 4 of the 5 PCR samples tested positive for Norovirus Group II. Water samples were obtained from the venue and these were found to be negative for coliforms. The public health sanitation investigation showed that there was no lapse in the hygiene practices. Conclusion: The outbreak was most likely to be due to the contamination of the raw oysters by Norovirus based on the symptomatology of the affected cases, results of the food survey and the positive results from the stool PCR analysis for Norovirus.

Methods: Intestinal bacteria were detected in total DNA isolated from stool samples by amplification of the 16S rRNA genes (variable regions V6 to V8). The amplicons were separated by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) with the WAVE system from Transgenomics Inc.. Results: The DHPLC peak-profiles of the PCR products were representative for the dominant intestinal bacterial groups. The applicability of the method was evaluated on 100 stool samples taken from 45 patients at various points during antibiotic therapy. The comparison of DHPLC profiles with band patterns generated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed that both techniques reproducibly detected the reduction in the bacterial diversity during antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, DHPLC and DGGE allowed the identification of resistant bacterial species. Conclusions: PCR-based DHPLC allows a rapid monitoring of the intestinal microflora and the technique is superior to DGGE for identification of bacterial species by sequencing of DNA from individual DHPLC fractions, as the DNA is easily sampled and kept in solution. The technique is well-suited for the global analysis of changes in complex microbial communities. The identification of bacterial species residing in patients receiving antibiotic treatment will guide novel therapy regimens, reducing the risk of complications. Objective: To obtain a simple and rapid medium to identify C. dubliniensis. Methods: 142 strains of Candida species were studied (30 C. albicans, 100 C. dubliniensis, 3 C. krusei, 3 C. glabrata, 3 C. guilliermondii, 2 C. parapsilosis, and one C. tropicalis). Strains were grown simultaneously on Pal's agar (sunflower seed agar) at 30\u00b0C for 48-72 h, CHROMagar Candida (CHROMagar, France) at 37\u00b0C for 24-48 h, and CHROMagar Candida supplemented with Pal's medium (CH-P agar) at 30\u00b0C for 24-48 h. Plates were examined visually by two investigators for colour and colony morphology. Chlamydospores were detected microscopically. The isolates were previously identified by conventional mycological methods and confirmed by PCR. Results: Ninety-six out of 100 C. dubliniensis isolates (96%) formed rough colonies on Pal's agar, 75% showed hyphal fringe and 93% produced chlamydospores. All C. albicans formed smooth colonies without hyphal fringe and failed to produce chlamydospores. All C. parapsilosis and C. krusei isolates formed rough colonies. The remaining Candida species formed smooth colonies but none of them produced chlamydospores. Fifty-eight out of 100 (58%) C. dubliniensis isolates grew as smooth dark green colonies on CHROMagar Candida and 42% as smooth light green colonies. Thirteen out of 30 (43.3%) C. albicans isolates formed light green smooth colonies and the remaining 56.6% formed green and dark green smooth colonies. The other Candida species developed different colours. Ninety-six out of 100 (96%) C. dubliniensis isolates grew as rough colonies on CH-P agar. Seventy-five formed hyphal fringe and 93 produced chlamydospores. Ninety-four isolate gave a bluish green colour that was easy to distinguish from C. albicans colony colour. All C. albicans isolates formed smooth light green colonies failing to produce neither hyphal fringe nor chlamydospores. Other Candida species formed smooth or rough colonies but with a distinguishable colour, and none of them was able to form chlamydospores. Conclusion: None of the individual media allowed a reliable identification of C. dubliniensis. However, the characteristic colour and colony morphology, as well as the abundant production of chlamydospores presented by most C. dubliniensis isolates on CH-P allows the rapid and reliable one step identification of this species.

            "text": "Evaluation of multiplex real-time PCR assay to discriminate Staphylococcus aureus from coagulase-negative staphylococci and determine methicillin resistance from culture and human sera Objectives: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major cause of Nosocomial infection with a worldwide prevalence. Early detection of MRSA is important in both patient management and the prompt implementation of infection control procedures. Molecular methods can be used to detect the presence of the mec A gene and hence methicillin resistance in both S. aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS). Furthermore, detection of a second target, fem A, which is specific for S. aureus and absent in CNS allows detection of both species and methicillin resistance. In the present study, a multiplex RT-PCR assay was established and evaluated to detect MRSA in culture and human sera seeded with MRSA using both of these gene targets and a Qiagen extraction kit. The new assay measures, in real-time, PCR product accumulation by means of dual labelled fluorogenic probes FAM and VIC. Methods: Strains representing EMRSA types 1-17 were examined for mecA and fem B. In addition, 83 strains of MRSA collected from Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) were tested. 35 isolates of a number of different species, including Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli from MRI and an in house culture collection, were tested to determine the specificity of the assay. Results: Amplification of mecA and fem B was correct for all staphylococcal isolates with the exception of two strains. The first was mec A negative. The second was negative fem B, but after further investigations it was CNS. These two isolates were phenotypically methicillin resistant. Serial dilutions were done to determine the sensitivity of this method, which was able to detect as few as 1.5 \u00b7 10 2 cells per ml. Conclusion: This multiplex RT-PCR assay represents a rapid, sensitive (% 99), specific (% 100) and accurate assay for the detection of MRSA with potential for direct detection of MRSA from clinical specimens.",

Methods: Subjects were randomly selected at the New Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Samples from 40 doctors' ties were incubated, bacterial colonies were counted, and Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonies were identified. Doctors were asked when the tie had last been cleaned. 100 participants were asked a questionnaire regarding attitudes to doctors not wearing ties. Previous related literature was reviewed. Results: The mean bacterial colony count on a doctor's tie was 68 and the distribution of colony counts was broad (s.d: 94). 20% of doctors' ties carried S. aureus. 2.5% carried MRSA. 70% of doctors had never cleaned their tie. 93% of respondents did not object to doctors not wearing ties. Factors that were considered to be more important were: wearing a shirt; being clean and tidy; being smart; wearing clear identification; and wearing trousers not jeans. Conclusions: MRSA can be found on ties. Current research suggests that doctors' ties can carry dangerous pathogens, that these pathogens can survive on ties for lengths of time long enough to allow cross-infection, that bacteria may be transferred to doctors' hands, that bacteria may be transferred directly from dangling tie-to-patient and that ties are a potential source of cross-infection. A large majority of people do not object to doctors not wearing ties. The tie may be taken away without damaging a doctor's professional integrity or the doctor-patient relationship, provided other desirable attire remains. Ties are associated with a risk of transferring pathogens, and are of little obvious benefit. Objectives: Mineral water (MW) should be free of P. aeruginosa according to the legal force of the mineral and table water act in Germany. We investigated an outbreak of P. aeruginosa where the pathogen was introduced into the hospital by MW in bottles. Methods: One medical intensive care unit (ICU) noticed an increase of pneumonias with P. aeruginosa. Environmental samples (tap water samples, siphons, surfaces, equipment for oropharyngeal hygiene, MW bottle) from the unit were cultured and typed. Clinical P. aeruginosa isolates were collected from five further ICUs. Microbiologic results were reviewed to determine the numbers of P. aeruginosa on a weekly time scale for the ICUs. All isolates were genotyped by PFGE and an AFLP PCRmethod. Results: Clinical specimens from five medical ICU patients yielded the same P. aeruginosa strain. In 4 from 103 environmental samples (3 \u00b7 siphon, 1 \u00b7 MW) P. aeruginosa was isolated. The isolates of the siphons were different to all patient isolates. The MW isolate was genetically indistinguishable to the 5 ICU patient isolates. Later the same strain was isolated in 4 more MW bottles of the same batch and in clinical specimens from 3 more medical ICU patients and seven patients of five other ICUs, respectively. Ten of the total 15 patients with P. aeruginosa developed pneumonia. After recognising the outbreak and the potential source delivery of this mineral water to the patients was stopped. The mean number of all ICU patients with newly detection of P. aeruginosa was 3.8 per week (Std. Dev. 1.6) in the 42 weeks prior to the outbreak. During the 6 weeks of the outbreak the weekly occurrence of new P. aeruginosa was 6, 6, 10, 9, 3, and 9 respectively (mean 7.2). In the four weeks after the outbreak on the ICUs the mean weekly occurrence of new patient with P. aeruginosa was 3.3.",

We conducted this study to asses the role of mold concentrations of ambient air and the impact of various weather conditions on mold concentration inside the hospital. Methods: Air sampling was conducted in 18 areas (6 outdoors) of our hospital (1000 beds, tertiary care) two times a week. The weather conditions were monitored at the day of sampling. Surveillance of Nosocomial Aspergillus infection was conducted by reviewing the records of all hospitalised neutropenic patients from 4/2004 to 10/2004. Results: During the study period a total of 614 air samples were available of which 514 (84%) revealed at least one fungal colony. Aspergillus sp. (AS) were isolated most frequently (mean 12 cfu/ m 3 of air), followed by Zygomycetes (zyg) (0.6 cfu/m 3 ) and other molds (3 cfu/m 3 ). A. niger (mean 3 vs. 2 cfu/m 3 ), A. flavus (1.5 vs. 0.3 cfu/m 3 ) and A. terreus (0.2 vs. 0.01 cfu/m 3 ) were found more frequently inside the hospital, whereas A. fumigatus was more common outdoors (10 vs. 7 cfu/m 3 ). During a short time of renovation activity, colony counts of AS (OR: 2.93, 95% CI 1.58-5.43) and zyg (OR: 4.08, 95% CI 2.29-7.29) increased significantly. Fungal growth was highest at 19-22\u00b0C (42% of isolates), in particular AS (OR: 1.62, CI 1.04-2.54) and zyg (OR: 3.53, CI 1.54-8.09). On rainy days, there were significantly higher chances of growth of AS (17 vs. 8 cfu/m 3 , p = 0.003) and zyg (0.5 vs. 1, p = 0.024) than during other weather conditions. High risk patient with leukemia or bone marrow transplantation were hospitalized during the study period. The number of neutropenic days was 635 with a mean of 31.6 days. Invasive mold infection was diagnosed In 10 patients (53%), and one of them died due to this infection. Conclusion: Our observations show relatively high concentrations of A. fumigatus in all environments, with a significantly increased amount of AS spores on rainy days. Our investigation suggests that exposure of high risk patients to high concentration of spores is a continuous risk for invasive fungal infections. Objectives: The purpose was to evaluate Infection Control (IC) practice using occult blood (OB)on clinical and non items used in dental and paediatric HCF as a marker for good IC practice. Methods: In a South African province all dental and paediatric facilities were surveyed for IC practice. The presence of OB in the environment and on critical care items were tested just prior to use on the next patient. on site sampling was carried out using a rapid immuno-chromatographic method (OBTI) (used in forensic analysis), capable of detecting 1:100000 Hb; a negative result reflected adequate cleaning or heat sterilization. Results: Overall, 31/110 (25%)and 15/41 (37%) of dental items tested were positive for OB, mainly found on extractor forceps, drill heads and probes. In the maternity & baby units, overall 25% o clinical equipment tested positive, particularly in the labour and maternity wards. The findings reflect poor levels of IC practice and training, but most importantly the cleaning & sterilization of critical equipment was inadequate. Conclusions: We found the OBTI test kit useful as a rapid test method while investigating IC practice particularly in poorly resourced settings. The test can be performed by on site, with minimum training and is an effective tool in assisting with IC evaluation. In countries with a national HIV prevalence of 20%, the presence of visible or occult blood on critical items of clinical equipment services, the possible risk of nosocomial transmission cannot be ignored. It is therefore essential that a test which can help to visualise probable risk of transmission will also serve as an effective teaching tool in IC and hygiene.",

            "text": "Nurse-to-patient-ratio as risk factor for nosocomial primary bloodstream infection in ICUs Objectives: Nosocomial primary bloodstream infections (BSI) cause significant morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients and have an enormous economic impact. In several studies understaffing was identified as a risk factor for outbreaks of BSI. However, little is known about the influence of nurse-to-patient-ratios on BSI in endemic situations on ICUs. We investigated the nurse-to-patient-ratio as a possible risk factor for BSI in an endemic situation. Methods: A prospective cohort study was done to identify exposures associated with cases of BSI. During an 18-month period all patients who were in one of two ICUs (A = 12 and B = 24 beds) for more than 3 days were included. Data collected on admission and discharge: admission date, age, sex, SAPS II, infections on admission, discharge date. Additional data collected during hospital stay: days on ICU, intubation, urinary tract catheter, central venous catheter, dialysis, surgical procedure during the stay on the ICU, and SOFA. Daily bed occupancy and nurse staffing on the ICU were also recorded. Nurse-to-patient ratio was determined by dividing nurse staffing by the patient density. Risk factor analysis included univariable approach and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: In total 801 patients were treated in the two ICUs. There was no difference between patients with BSI and patients without BSI concerning mean of age, distribution of sex, average stay on ICU of patients with no BSI and average duration between admission and diagnosis of BSI of case patients, and numbers of infections on admission in the two groups. Patients with BSI had a significant higher SAPS II on admission as patients who developed no BSI. 21 patients (2.6%) had a BSI. The nurse-topatient ratio of ICU A was 0.86 and of ICU B 0.91. The overall nurse-to-patient ratio in patients without BSI was 0.90 and in patients with BSI was 0.87. The Hazard ratio of nurse-to-patient ratio in the Cox analysis was 0.61; p = 0.04, that means patients with average higher nurse-to-patient ratio per day had less BSIs. Conclusions: BSI is highly dependent on hygienic behaviour. The result of the study underlines that staffing is an important point in patient safety in hospitals. To our knowledge is this the first study which investigated the influence of staffing on endemic BSI in one hospital where the patient was the unit of analysis. Objectives: Many studies have suggested that disseminating Nosocomial infections (NI) risk-adjusted reliable infection rates obtained through surveillance to healthcare personnel (HCP) and establishing a link with prevention efforts is essential for successful control. Our study goals were: i) to evaluate the efficacy of feeding back NI surveillance data to HCP of a Urologic Clinic and ii) to provide indicators useful for benchmarking within and between surgical wards. Methods: Active surveillance was performed at the Urologic Clinic of an Italian University Hospital, in accordance with the methods, protocols and definitions of the National Nosocomial infections Surveillance (NNIS) System, USA. A first 1 monthsurveillance survey was conducted in June-July 2002 and data recorded and analyzed. Diagnosis was based on CDC definitions for NI. Each suspected infection was discussed and validated by the epidemiologists, infection control personnel and surgeons. Indicators were calculated including site specific NI incidence and incidence density rates. At the end of the study a feedback session was held and results were communicated and discussed with the staff. A second study was planned and performed as a 4 months-surveillance survey from April to July 2004. Surveillance data were analyzed and compared. Results: The cumulative incidence of NI decreased from 8.0% patients in 2002 to 2.3% in 2004 and incidence density from 11.5& patient-days to 3.2& (p < 0.05, chi square test). Symptomatic urinary tract infections were not detected in 2002 while in 2004 their incidence was 1.4& patient-days, 13.04& catheterized patients and 3.04& patient-days of catheterization. Surgical site infections (SSI) incidence and incidence density decreased respectively from 5.4% patients to 1.3% and from 7.7& patient-days to 1.8& (p < 0.05). SSI rates by operative procedure and NNIS risk index category decreased from values above the 90th percentile of NNIS distribution to values between the 75th and the 90th percentile. Conclusions: Few surveillance data have been published on NI rates in urological patients. Our study represents a contribution to building specific benchmarking and an example of successful control of NI in a urology ward. Several explanation may be suggested to have prevented infections, but the role of feeding back information to 'those who need to know', changing personnel behaviour and improving the quality of patient care is shown to have been critical. Objectives: We developed a computerized automated surveillance system (ASS) for bacteraemia in a 850-bed university hospital. The aims of this study were to validate ASS-generated results and to identify possible improvements. Methods: The ASS was based on a computerized data warehouse that included laboratory data (date of all blood and catheter cultures, and species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing in positive cultures) and demographic data (patients' ID, ward, and date of admission). Algorithms distinguished true bacteraemia from contamination (culture of a possible contaminant in one of several blood samples), nosocomial bacteraemia (positive culture of blood drawn >48 hours after admission), and catheter-related bacteraemia among the latter (same bacteria with the same antibiotic susceptibility in blood and on IV catheter cultured simultaneously \u00b16 days). Bacteremias that occurred more than 3 days apart were considered distinct episodes. We reviewed all positive blood cultures classified by the ASS as nosocomial bacteraemia not related to a catheter in adult patients admitted over 2 years on the following wards: surgery, medicine, and medical and surgical ICUs. The gold standard for validation of classification by the ASS was a manual review of patients' charts using the CDC criteria for nosocomial infections. Results: The ASS identified 154 nosocomial bacteraemia not related to a catheter. 106/154 (69%) were confirmed by chart review (77% in medicine, 60% in surgery, and 73% in ICU). There were 3 reasons for misclassification by the ASS: a late documentation of community-acquired bacteremias in 3/154 (2%) cases; the absence of catheter culture in 25 (16%) cases of bacteraemia clinically attributed to catheter infection; and duplication of bacteraemia sustained over >3 days in 20 (13%) cases (13 of which being fungaemia in surgical patients). We explored 2 alternative uses of available data to improve ASS performance: 1) attributing all coagulase-negative bacteremias to catheter infections led to correct classification of 8/154 (5%) more cases at the price of 2 additional misclassifications; 2) expending the time interval to 10 days for definition of duplicates in case of fungaemia allowed correct classification of 11/154 (7%) cases at no cost. The ASS accurately classified nosocomial bacteraemia not related to catheter in 78% of the cases by implementing both strategies. Conclusion: ASS is a promising alternative to manual surveillance of nosocomial bacteraemia. Background: During the years 1997-2001 a hospital-wide sustained rise in the incidence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) bloodstream infections (BSI) was observed in our centre, a 900-bed primary and tertiary care university hospital catering an adult population. While control of single source outbreaks has been reported, data on hospitalwide endemic situations are scarce. Methods: A prospective BSI surveillance system in on going in the hospital since 1988. MDR AB was defined by resistance to all antimicrobials except carbapenems, ampicillin-sulbactam or amikacin (excluding colistin). Blood cultures were processed using Bactec 9240 (Becton Dickinson, USA) and antibiotic susceptibilities were tested by disc diffusion. Intervention: In 2002 intensive staff education and multiple interventions were initiated hospital-wide. Alcohol-based hand-rub solution was distributed in patients' rooms and on patients' beds in intensive care units (ICU). Hand hygiene guidelines were implemented and reinforced. All cleansing protocols and housekeeping procedures were reviewed and mended. A laboratory alert for AB isolates was installed; patients colonised or infected with MDR strains were placed in contact isolation for the duration of their hospitalisation. Infection control personnel rigorously surveyed isolation policy. Restriction of carbapenem use was reinforced.",

The efficacy of new and existing agents continues to be compromised, both by the transmission of existing mechanisms via clonal spread and by new, emergent mechanisms of resistance. Antibacterial resistance occurs across all bacteria, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, and is widespread amongst community-acquired and nosocomial infections. In the community, instances of multi-drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, in which strains are resistant to three or more drug classes, are becoming common and increasingly include resistance to fluoroquinolones as well as beta-lactams, macrolides and other classes. Furthermore, community strains of MRSA are beginning to arise independently of nosocomial strains and can exhibit increased virulence. New surveillance data show that community strains of Enterobacteriaceae act as reservoirs for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) resistance, the extent and types of which are increasing. Fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli is also increasing and exceeds 50% in much of S.E. Asia. New patterns of resistance are being observed in hospitalacquired infections. MRSA is frequently observed in this environment and is becoming increasingly difficult to treat as strains become resistant to almost all available drug classes. In the mid-1990s, the first strains of MRSA with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin were detected, and the vanA gene has been identified in 3 independent strains of MRSA. Severe hospital-acquired infections are frequently caused by Gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophila. These pathogens are resistant to many beta-lactams, and although resistance to many carbapenems remains rare, resistance to those of the IMP, VIM and OXA family is increasing.",

            "text": "The last two decades have seen a decline in antibacterial development productivity and, more recently, in the scale of antibacterial R&D. During the same time, the level and prevalence of antibacterial resistance have increased to worrying levels. The clinical impact of current resistance levels in hospital infections is well established, and accumulating evidence suggests that resistant bacteria are implicated in the clinical failure of antibacterials in the community setting. Given the current situation, it is vital to develop new, effective agents and to sustain the clinical utility of these and existing therapies. Many recent initiatives have recognized the importance of using antibacterials appropriately in order to sustain antibacterial efficacy. This requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, an accurate clinical diagnosis and severity assessment is vital to avoid the use of antibacterials when they are not warranted, such as in viral infection. Secondly, agents with an appropriate spectrum of activity and pharmacodynamic profile should be selected, to provide maximal reduction of bacterial load and minimize the potential for selection and spread of resistance. Consideration of local resistance patterns is essential when selecting the type or dose of agent to address resistant isolates. Development of improved diagnostic techniques to differentiate aetiologies, and stratification of patients according to predictors of both bacterial resistance and outcome would further enable clinicians to tailor therapy choices for individuals. High-dose and shorter treatment may reduce risk factors for selection of resistant strains. Vaccines may also play a role in sustaining antibacterial efficacy by reducing the incidence of bacterial infections and their sequelae, but their effects on resistance may be limited by replacement of vaccine serotypes with non-vaccine serotypes that have emerging resistances. Antibacterials from new classes are urgently required that will combat existing resistance, minimize the emergence of resistance and the risk of cross-resistance, provide high bacteriological efficacy against target organisms, possess a well-defined safety profile and provide a convenient dosing regimen. In the future, advanced techniques may enable the development of antibacterials designed to target specific indications or pathogens, while having a reduced ecological impact. Some novel agents are reaching the late stages of development and their appropriate use should be encouraged from the outset.",

            "text": "The genomic era of antibacterial drug discovery was triggered by the completion of the H. influenzae genome in 1995. At that time, it was thought that the antibacterial therapy area was the ideal model to illustrate the ability of genomics to rapidly deliver novel mechanism medicines. Consequently, many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies set up genomicbased antibacterial programmes. It was generally believed that genomics would fuel a flow of targets that could be screened to rapidly identify new classes of antibiotics. This genomic exploitation was spectacularly successful in delivering hundreds of novel antibacterial strategies. A review of the literature from the last 9 years reveals a fraction of the substantial effort applied to this area, showing >35 different companies ran >120 screens on >60 different antibacterial targets. Clearly, investment in this area has been significant, but success based on the number of novel acting antibiotics in the industry pipeline is alarmingly low and there are some key scientific reasons for this poor success rate. First, screening metrics illustrate that the success of antibacterial High Throughput Screening (HTS) is significantly less productive than screening targets from other therapeutic areas. Second, optimizing hits and leads from HTS to molecules with all the requisite properties to be a safe and efficacious antibacterial can be exceptionally challenging compared to creating new generations of antibacterials from established classes where substantial background structure-activity relationships exist. Third, the initial bioinformatic and genomic analysis used to validate a target may not always extrapolate to a broader set of strains from the species or a range of target species. Consequently, a refocus of effort and resource is required to tackle antibacterial discovery in the post genomic world. Investment in new genomic technologies or novel target discovery is no longer merited. Focusing significant, consolidated medicinal chemistry and microbiology resources on advanced leads is essential for success rather than spreading effort across a large portfolio of targets. Furthermore, approaches for enhancing success at HTS and prioritizing effort on targets that are validated 'beyond the genome' are required. This presentation will illustrate some of the scientific challenges faced by GlaxoSmithKline in exploiting genomics to deliver new antibacterial agents and describe some of the strategies implemented in our ongoing efforts to seek new antibacterials in the post genomic world.",

The demonstration of utility against bacteria resistant to other antibacterial classes is essential for registration, reimbursement and marketing, but presents issues related to clinical trial size, costs and end-points. Furthermore, product labelling and use may be restricted in the future, at least at initial introduction, by regulators and policy makers. For some indications, such as selflimiting infections or indications where the value of antibacterials is debatable, paradigms for clinical trials are changing towards patient-reported outcome measures and demonstration of superiority over comparators. Additionally, antibacterial molecules of new classes present unknown safety liabilities, requiring extensive evaluation and tracking throughout the product's lifespan. The commercial potential of new products may be impacted by reduced use owing to continuing efforts to control resistance and costs through guidelines and reimbursement controls, as well as narrowed indications. Furthermore, a product's lifespan may be reduced by the development of antibacterial resistance if use is expanded greatly or inappropriately. Positive solutions must be found to encourage the development of new antibacterials. Strategies could include lowering R&D costs by introducing measures such as guaranteed 'fast-track' regulatory review or by focusing on the quality rather than the quantity of clinical trials. Regulatory agencies could further assist by providing direction on regulatory expectations and identifying areas of debate to be addressed during the development process. Additionally, research costs could be offset by partnerships between academia and industry, or by provision of public or private funding, tax breaks, and revision of patent terms.

Adherence was promoted by the addition of Fn or Fg, which most probably act as bridging molecules. Interestingly, promotion of adherence mediated by Fn was in the same range with S. carnosus producing either FnBPA or FnBPB, whereas promotion of adherence mediated by Fg was significantly more pronounced with S. carnosus producing FnBPA than with S. carnosus producing FnBPB. Furthermore, FnBPA, but not FnBPB mediated platelet aggregation when present on S. carnosus cells indicating a substantial functional difference between both proteins. To identify platelet-binding sites involved in that interaction, platelets from knockout mice and from patients with selective inherited deficiency of membrane proteins or of granules were used. CD36, GPIIb/IIIa, and P-selectin were excluded as receptors for S. aureus and the contents of alpha-granules, such as Fg, Fn, and thrombospondin, have been shown to be essential for the S. aureus-platelet interaction. Furthermore, we found that soluble fibrin, but not Fg is the main mediator of that interaction.",

            "text": "Surgical Site Infections (SSI) are important complications of surgery. Although many advances have been made in asepsis, antisepsis and surgical technique over the last century, infections are still relatively frequent complications.The pathogenesis of SSI is complex and not completely understood. Therefore, prevention can only be partly achieved by control of the process and outcome measurement remains essential for optimal performance. Repeatedly it has been shown that measuring of SSI-rates with active reporting of these rates to the surgeons results in a reduction of the SSI-rate. Although this is generally accepted there is no consensus how to do this. There are many aspects that should be taken care of, to produce reliable and reproducible SSI-rates. Things get even more critical when these rates are used for comparisons. The following aspects are of major importance: Definitions, case-finding methods and control for confounding (risk factors should be taken into account).In the last decade several large, multicentre, surveillance projects have been performed and have shown that significant variations in the SSI-rates between different hospitals exist. However, these variations were for an important part caused by differences in the case-finding methods used or by differences in the population of patients operated on. Therefore, they do not necessarily reflect true differences in the performance of the participating centres. Also, it has been shown that centres that participate in such projects for several years achieve a significant reduction of the SSI-rates. It are true quality improvement projects. The conclusion is that measuring SSI-rates in a standardised way with reporting of the rates to those that can improve the outcome, improves the quality of care. Now those rates have been gathered, there is a demand from the public to know the hospital specific rates. One of the main reasons for this must be that patients should be able to make a more justified decision were they want to be operated. The question is if this is a justified assumption? There are several arguments against publication of SSI-rates: 1) It is likely that the SSI-rates will be less reliable (too low) when they are published in a way that the centre or even surgeon involved can be identified.",

Moreover, if it is enforced to publish SSI-rates this will likely terminate one of the most important methods to improve quality in surgery currently available. Objectives: Cholera is a severe intestinal disease, caused by different spices of Vibrio cholerae. While cholera affects many millions of people around the world, the main reservoir of the bacterium is not completely known. Since both free-living amoeba and V. cholerae inhabit aquatic systems, an association between them would be possible. Our previous study has shown that the seventh-pandemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor-Inaba strain N16961 behaves as a facultative intracellular bacterium during its survival in free-living amoebae. Here we address the question if strains of V. cholerae O1 classical have the same ability as strain N16961 to grow and survive inside Acanthamoeba castellanii. Methods: V. cholerae O1 classical strains were co-cultivated with A. castellanii for more than two weeks. The interaction between these microorganisms was followed by viable counts of aloneand co-cultivated microorganisms. Intra-amoebic growth and localization of each bacterial strain was estimated by gentamicin assay, viable count, microscopy, and PCR to detect cholera toxin gene and amoebic 18 s RNA gene disclosing symbiont-host association.",

Microscopic examination of stool specimens is the cornerstone of detection of intestinal parasites in parasitology laboratories and is the best known and most frequently performed laboratory procedure. Although process has been made in non-morphologic diagnosis (e.g. ELISA-and PCR techniques) microscopy is still considered to be the gold standard in the diagnosis of intestinal protozoal infecions, including giardiasis. In the Netherlands, as in most other members of the European Union, fresh, nonpreserved stool specimens are generally used for examination. Specimens are initially screened as direct wet preparations using either Lugol's iodine or eosine for detection of vegetative stages of protozoa and are subsequently examined for protozoan cysts and helminth eggs using an ether-or ethylacetate sedimentation method or flotation concentration technique. Because intestinal parasites are shed intermittently, patients are asked to deliver at least three stool specimens. The limitation of this diagnostic approach is that detection of the vegetative stages of protozoa may be missed because of delays in processing and/or low compliance to the request to submit multiple stool samples.",

Conclusion: Trichinellosis is a zoonotic infection related to the ingestion of undercooked pork meat. In our study most of the cases occurred in the context of an outbreak. We found a high percentage of cases related to the consumption of pigs and their derivatives that escaped from sanitary inspection. This shows the lack of adequate bromatological control in our environment. The frequency distribution of symptoms and/or signs was similar to other series. In an appropiate epidemiologic context, characteristic clinical symptoms strongly suggest the diagnosis of trichinellosis, which can be confirmed with serologic tests and/or identification of larvae in the involved meat. Health education for breeders, producers and consumers is very important in order to prevent future outbreaks. There is an urgent need to identify novel targets to combat drug resistance. Method: We developed a genomic microarray for L. donovani comprising of 4224 PCR amplified inserts(1.0 to 1.5 kb), 24 positive and 12 negative controls, each printed in triplicate. Two-color fluorescent (Cy3 andCy5) hybridizations were used to compare gene expression in drug resistant and sensitive strains.

Although VIM and IMP-producing strains were not observed in animals and human healthy volunteers, these enzymes seem not to be restricted to the hospital setting anymore. Disturbingly, the results emerging from this study show that, even if in very low frequencies, the presence of VIM-2 loose in the environment, namely in sewage and rivers, may undermine the effectiveness of carbapenems, largely depending on the eradication or confinement of resistant bacteria. Objectives: There is increasing concern about the spread of Enterobacteriaceae, principally E. coli, producing CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in the UK. This is reflected in increasing surveillance reports and submissions to the reference laboratories, with many isolates reportedly from community patients. To better assess the situation, a prospective survey of cephalosporin-resistance was undertaken for Enterobacteriaceae across London and Southeast England. Methods: Eighteen laboratories participated: 10 in London and 8 elsewhere in southeast England. These screened all Enterobacteriaceae isolates using cefpodoxime or both cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Isolates resistant to any of these 3 cephalosporins were submitted for centralised susceptibility testing and identification. Interpretive reading was performed, allowing an inference of resistance mechanism(s). Results: During a 12-week collection period, >1000 cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates were collected, mostly submitted on the basis of their cefpodoxime resistance. E. coli was by far the most numerous species (>50% of all isolates), with over 70% of these having an ESBL, usually conferring a CTX-M phenotype. Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. were also well represented (each over 15% of resistant isolates). The majority of the resistant Klebsiella isolates had phenotypes indicative of ESBL production but two-thirds of enterobacters had phenotypes implying derepression of AmpC. ESBLs were detected in a few Citrobacter, Morganella and Serratia spp. isolates, but not in P. mirabilis. Approximately 60% of all cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were inferred to be ESBL-producers, mostly with CTX-M phenotypes, whereas isolates with AmpC phenotypes accounted for 20%. The remaining 20% comprised of isolates inferred to have other beta-lactamases, or non-enzymatic resistance. Objectives: Characterisation of the expanded-spectrum betalactamase resistance determinant of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate from a scrotal swab of a patient admitted with a dissecting aneurism of the left arteria renalis, complicated with renal insufficiency at the Heilig Hartziekenhuis Roeselare, Belgium. This strain was resistant to ticarcillin, and of intermediate susceptibility to piperacillin, ceftazidime and aztreonam. Methods: Screening for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes was performed using double-disk synergy test and PCR techniques. Shotgun cloning was performed with Sau3AI-partially digested DNA of P. aeruginosa and pBK-CMV cloning vector. Selection was performed on amoxicillincontaining plates.",

Sequence analysis identified a novel Ambler class A beta-lactamase BEL-1 (pI 7.1) weakly related to any other ESBLs. BEL-1 shared 5 and 43% amino acid identity with the plasmid-mediated ESBLs GES-1 and CTX-M-8, respectively. BEL-1 activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid and tazobactam, and uncommonly also by cefoxitin, moxalactam, and imipenem. It hydrolysed significantly expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam. The blaBEL-1 gene was as a form of a gene cassette in a class 1 integron, located downstream of an aacA4 gene cassette encoding an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, and upstream of i) an aadA gene cassette encoding an adenylyltransferase and ii) the smr2 gene cassette similar to sugE-type genes and encoding a putative membrane transporter of cationic drugs. This integron was chromosome-located and part of a transposon. Conclusion: A novel ESBL gene was identified in P. aeruginosa underlining i) the diversity of ESBL genes, ii) that P. aeruginosa may be a reservoir of these genes and iii) that integrons are common vehicles of these genes. Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentration for 10 antimicrobial agents was determined by the agar dilution method. Sulphonamide resistant isolates were screened for class 1 and 2 integrons by PCR assays. The characterisation of resistance gene cassettes was investigated by PCR, PCR-RFLP with TaqI and sequencing. Clonality was assessed by PFGE following XbaI digestion. Results: 46% of the isolates were susceptible to all tested antimicrobial agents, 33% presented a single type of resistance, and 21% were multiresistant. Resistance to nalidixic acid (30%), tetracycline (19%), streptomycin (18%), sulfamethoxazole (17%) and ampicillin (17%) were the most common. Resistance to sulphonamides (n = 200) was always associated with resistance to other antimicrobial agents, with 75% (n = 150) carrying one (1000 to 2000 bp) or two (1000 and 1200 bp) class 1 integrons and 3% (n = 5) simultaneously carrying a class 1 and 2 integrons. 7 RFLP integron types were found, with the aadA genes (aadA1, aadA2 and aadA5) alone or downstream of a trimethoprim resistance gene (dfrA1, dfrA12 and dfrA17) or of a beta-lactamase gene (blaOXA-30), detected in the variable region of 149 integrons. The spread of class 1 integrons occurred among several Salmonella serotypes and PFGE clones. However, some Typhimurium-specific integrons were found: 1000 (aadA2) and 1200 bp (blaPSE-1) simultaneously, or one of 2000 bp (blaOXA-30-aadA1). In contrast, the other profiles appeared in several serotypes, with the integrons carrying dfrA1-aadA1 or dfrA12-aadA2 the most disseminated. Interestingly, data did not suggest any difference in the distribution of resistance gene cassettes between human and foods of animal origin isolates. Conclusion: The present study with Portuguese isolates indicates that antibiotic resistance mediated by integrons is common among diverse Salmonella serotypes. All types of integrons were shared among human and food isolates, suggesting that resistance determinants present among animals may contribute to the problem of multidrug resistant Salmonella in humans.",

            "text": "Sporadic and outbreak cases of plasmid-mediated quinolone-resistance in German ICUs Objectives: The occurrence of a novel plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance has been reported in a few cases outside Europe. This transmissible quinolone resistance gene (qnr) was detected in isolates from patients in the USA, China and Egypt. Molecular analysis demonstrated the location of the qnr-gene in class I integrons. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of qnr-positve strains in German ICUs. Methods: Six hundred and forty-eight fluoroquinolone or cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp., obtained from 34 ICUs during the last three years were screened for the presence of integrons. One hundred and thirtyfour strains containing integron cassettes as well as integrase sequences were tested for the presence of the qnr gene-locus by use of PCR. Results: One isolate of Enterobacter spp. from a German ICU patient turned out to be qnr-positive as well as five Citrobacter freundii strains from three patients treated in a South-German ICU during a one month period. All C. freundii strains were indistinguishable by use of XbaI macrorestriction analysis. Moreover, none of these quinolone-resistant strains were susceptible to cefoxitin, ceftazidime or cefotaxime. Conclusion: This is one of the first reports of qnr-positive strains obtained from patients in Europe. Molecular epidemiology suggests that qnr-positve strains were involved in an outbreak in one ICU. The spread of transmissible quinolone-resistance might be underscored. Results: 20 strains were qnr-positive, distributed as 17 E. cloacae, 1 K. pneumoniae, 1 C. freundii and 1 P. mirabilis. A new qnr allele was observed for the P. mirabilis strain with 29 nucleotide and 3 amino-acid differences referring to the original sequence. For the other strains, the qnr sequence differed from the original strain by the mutation 537A/G described in isolates from USA and China. From the experiments performed on the first E. cloacae isolate, qnr was shown to be transferred by conjugation to E. coli BM13 resulting in a low level quinolone resistance (Cip MIC 0.1 lg/ml, levofloxacin MIC of 0.25 mg/L). All the qnr-positive strains were ESBL producers. Whereas strains with MIC of ciprofloxacin (Cip) above 16 mg/L harboured gyrA and parC mutations, the 3 strains with Cip MIC below 1 mg/L showed wild-type sequences for QRDR in gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE. RAPD and ERIC PCR analysis showed that among the 17 E. cloacae strains, 10 strains distributed into 3 clusters (6, 2 and 2 strains) and the other 7 were not genetically related. Conclusion: We detected the qnr gene in strains from different enterobacterial species with a prevalence of 7% of the ESBL producers. Qnr-positive strains without additional topoisomerase mutations showed a low level of quinolone resistance that might be undetected by standard susceptibility testing. Objectives: To analyze the clonal relationship and antibiotic resistance genetic elements of different VREF isolates from a healthy human (HV) collected during a 4-y period. Methods: Feces from a 53-y old Portuguese male, without exposure to antibiotics or hospital in the 3 and 12 months previous to the sample collection were analyzed (Feb2001-Jun-2004). He had hospital exposure for 1 day for a colonoscopy (Sep-2001) and 5 days for a shoulder surgery (Sep-2003). Samples were pre-enriched in BHI plus 6 mg/L of vancomycin and then plated in the same media Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the agar dilution method. Species identification, the presence of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence traits, and the Tn1546 backbone structure, were determined by a PCR. PurK was identified by PCR and sequencing. Clonal relatedness was established by SmaI-and ApaI-PFGE. Results: Six VREF corresponding to 3 PFGE types were recovered. They were also resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin and HLRKm. All isolates contained vanA and ermB, while (aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia), aph(3')-IIIa and vatE were only found in some cases. Isolates of each PFGE type contained purK-1 which is associated to E. faecium clonal complex C1 that includes VREF causing outbreaks worldwide. Three Tn1546 types were detected: PP-5 and PP-6 contain an ISEf1 insertion between vanX-vanY region (frequently found among Portuguese VRE faecalis clinical isolates) and type D (frequent among animals). No virulence factors were detected. Conclusions: The persistence of VREF isolates belong to a C1 lineage carrying elements associated to both the hospital setting (Tn1546 with ISEf1 and purK1) and animal sources (Tn1546 type D) in community based humans is of concern since it might serve as a reservoir of clinical relevant genes or clones that can be spread to both hospital and environmental settings. Objectives: The recent increase in fusidic acid resistance (fusR) in S. aureus strains causing impetigo in Europe is primarily the result of dissemination of a single successful fusR clone. We have designated this strain the Epidemic European Fusidic acid-resistant Impetigo Clone (EEFIC). To better understand the emergence, spread and success of the EEFIC, we have subjected it to detailed phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Methods: Strain typing was conducted by PFGE, MLST and spa-typing procedures. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion. Reversed passive latex agglutination kits were used to test for exfoliative toxin A (ETA) and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), whilst PCR was used to probe for the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) gene. Established techniques were employed for cloning, shotgun DNA sequencing and bioinformatics. Results: EEFIC was susceptible to the majority of antibiotics tested, but resistant to fus, macrolides (mac) and penicillin (pen). Shotgun sequencing of the single, large (40 Kb) plasmid carried by this clone revealed that it was closely related to staphylococcal plasmid pETB, and indicated the presence of exfoliative toxin B (ETB), epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor C (EDIN-C), and a cadmium resistance determinant. In addition, EEFIC tested positive for ETA, but negative for TSST-1 and PVL toxins. The fusR gene, fusB, was cloned from the chromosome on a HindIII fragment, and found to lie upstream of the groEL gene, at the hypervariable locus occupied in some strains by the SaPI1 pathogenicity island. Furthermore, this analysis revealed that fusB has been recruited to the chromosome as a fragment of the archetypal fusR plasmid, pUB101. Conclusions: Exfoliative toxins are frequently found in S. aureus strains causing impetigo bullosa; EEFIC carries both ETA and ETB. In addition, the presence of the ADPribosylating exotoxin, EDIN-C, may contribute to this strain's ability to cause superficial disease. In conjunction with genes conferring resistance to antibiotics that are mainstays in the treatment of dermatological infections (fus, mac), and in particular the stable recruitment of fusB to the chromosome, the success of the EEFIC as a cause of impetigo bullosa is not surprising.",

Since this prevalence was not negligible and this group of atypical Pn is largely understudied, we aimed to unequivocally identify these strains and obtain insights into its population structure. Methods: The presumptive identification of the isolates as NTPn was based on optochin susceptibility after incubation in 5% CO2 atmosphere, typical colony morphology, and nontypeability by the Quellung reaction. Definitive identification of the strains as Pn included bile solubility and PCR detection of lytA and psaA, genes ubiquitous in Pn. Capsular type determination was re-assayed by multiplex PCR serotyping. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done according to the NCCLS guidelines. Genetic diversity was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: Between 1997 and 2003, 201 DR NTPn-like strains were isolated. The majority (170 or 84.6%) were bile soluble and positive for lytA and psaA. By multiplex PCR serotyping, 155 of the 170 confirmed Pn yielded no result suggesting that the capsular polysaccharide (cps) locus was absent. These strains were considered to be true NTPn. The remaining 15 strains were positive by the multiplex serotyping PCR and could be assigned a capsular type upon retesting them by the Quellung reaction. Ninety-three per cent of the 155 true NTPn were multidrug resistant. The most common antibiotype was resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, tetracycline, cotrimoxazole, and intermediate resistance to penicillin. PFGE analysis of the true NTPn strains identified 29 clones. One major clone accounted for 46.5% of the isolates, was prevalent through time and was disseminated in several daycare centres. Conclusions: The isolation of presumptive NTPn requires further confirmation tests since these atypical strains are not easily identified. The prevalence of true NTPn among carriers ranged from 2.9 to 13.0% of the DR strains (average 7.0%). These isolates are frequently multidrug resistant and appear to lack the cps locus. The high number of clones found suggests that NTPn have diverse evolutionary origins. Careful monitorization of NTPn is important since these strains are not targeted by any of the pneumococcal vaccines commercially available.",

            "text": "Persistence of sulphonamide resistance in the community despite lack of selection Objectives: Strategies to limit spread or reduce the prevalence of antibiotic resistance commonly assume that resistance will decline in the absence of selective pressure. However sulphonamide resistance in Escherichia coli persisted in the UK from 1991 to 1999, despite a dramatic reduction in prescribing. The goal of this study was to examine whether this trend had continued in 2004, nine years since the UK restriction in prescription, and to investigate the mechanisms that have lead to the maintenance of sulphonamide resistance. Methods: Urinary E. coli isolates were obtained from the diagnostic microbiology laboratory of the Royal London Hospital. All consecutive isolates from urinary specimens from January through to March 2004 were included. Sulphonamide resistance genes, sul1, 2 and 3, were detected by PCR. Results: Of the 391 E. coli isolates recovered in 2004, 45.5% were sulphonamide resistant compared to 46.0% in 1999, and 39.7% in 1991. The sul2 gene continued to be the most prevalent resistance determinant, present in 81% of resistant isolates in 2004 (79% and 67% in 1999 and 1991 respectively); 28% of resistant isolates carried both sul1 and sul2 genes. The sul3 gene was not found. Conclusion: Continued persistence of sulphonamide resistance has been confirmed in 2004. One explanation for the persistence and spread of sul2-mediated sulphonamide resistance is that sul2 could be stably linked to other factors that continue to be under positive selection pressure. Thirty-eight sul2 plasmids were therefore transferred to a fully susceptible E. coli host strain. Sul2 was frequently found to be co-transferred with other antibiotic resistance markers, most notably ampicillin (76%) and streptomycin (74%) resistance. Location of sul2 adjacent to the streptomycin resistance genes strA and strB has been noted before and was confirmed in most plasmids; however streptomycin is now rarely used in clinical practice. Preliminary results indicated that there was not a similar physical linkage with an ampicillin resistance determinant. DNA fingerprinting and the pattern of resistance profiles demonstrated that sul2 plasmids were extremely diverse. The data suggest that sul2 (with strAB) is borne on a discrete genetic element that is not stably linked to other selectively advantageous determinants, but has been able to mobilise and disseminate amongst a wide variety of plasmids in clinical E. coli. Objectives: Deaths in people with HIV infection are often classified according to whether they are HIV-related or not. We aimed to study whether deaths generally supposed to be unrelated to HIV are in fact more likely to occur in people with a low CD4 count. Methods: D:A:D is a prospective study of 23,441 patients (pts) from 11 existing cohorts in Europe, Australia and the US. Detailed information on deaths occurring between the initiation of D:A:D in 2000 and Feb 2004 was collected; causes of death were coded centrally. Relative rates (RR) of factors associated with deaths from each cause were calculated using Poisson regression. Results: Of the 23,441 persons, 82% had used ART prior to enrolment (median exposure 2.8 years). Over the study period, 1248 (5.3%) pts died (incidence: 1.6 deaths/100 person-years). The leading cause of death was AIDS (30%) followed by liverrelated death (14% -of which 79% were associated with chronic viral hepatitis), death from heart disease (incl. cardiovascular disease; 9%), and death from non-AIDS malignancies (8%). The proportion of deaths from these causes remained stable over time. AIDS-related deaths were, as expected, strongly associated with the latest CD4 cell count (RR of death from an AIDS-event in pts with latest CD4 count <50 cells/L versus >500 cells/L after adjustment for HIV RNA, age, cohort, race: 96.4 [95% CI: 61.6-150.7], p < 0.0001). Liver-related deaths (RR 26.6 [12.9-54.7], p < 0.0001) and deaths from non-AIDS malignancies (23.5 [9.4-58.7], p < 0.0001) were similarly strongly associated with latest CD4 count; the relationship with death from heart disease was less strong but remained significant (3.1 [1.2-8.2], p = 0.02). The trends persisted after lagging the analyses to associations with CD4 counts 3 and 6 months earlier.",

            "text": "Feeding antibiotics to animals in order to make them grow faster has been common practice in intensive agricultural production systems since the late fifties. In December 2002 the European Union member states banned the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters from January 2006. What lies behind this change in attitude? In 1997 the World Health Organization recommended; that the use of antibiotics for growth promotion should be terminated if they are also used for treatment in animals or humans, and furthermore, that the use of other classes of antimicrobials as growth promoters should be gradually phased out and substituted with safer non-antimicrobials alternatives. In April 1998, the Danish poultry, cattle and pig producers terminated the use of antimicrobials growth promoters. The DANMAP programme monitors the impact of the withdrawal of antimicrobial growth promoters on antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial usage in Denmark. The total volume of active antimicrobials used for food animals is reduced by more than 50%. Resistance to the most commonly used AGP's tylosin, virginiamycin, avoparcin and avilamycin has declined significantly. In a number of European countries the occurrence of VRE in humans in the community has declined. The producers in Denmark were concerned about terminating the use of AGP's. We have analyzed the national poultry productivity data. Productivity were not affected by the termination, and mortality rates were likewise unaffected. Feed efficiency has changed slightly however, the savings on antibiotics for growth promotion offsets the extra cost of feed. In finishing pigs no or only a very limited effect of the withdrawal of AGP's has been observed, however in weaned pigs, some herds have experienced problems with post weaning diarrhoea. The overall productivity has been increasing after the Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 termination.The prevalence of Salmonella in broiler flocks and chicken products as well as in swine herds and pork in Denmark has continued to decline after the withdrawal of the growth promoters. The European Union will terminate the continuous feeding of antimicrobials to healthy animals for growth promotion. Experiences from Denmark, as well as from other countries, such as Switzerland, Finland and Sweden, show that banning antimicrobial growth promoters has a minimal impact on agricultural productivity, but leads to major reductions in antimicrobial resistance. To establish and maintain a successful infection, microbial pathogens have evolved a variety of strategies to invade the host, avoid or resist the innate immune response, damage the cells and multiply in specific and normally sterile regions. Based on their capacity to deal with these critical issues, bacteria can be grouped in different categories. This talk will focus on the tactics used by enteroinvasive bacteria (e.g. Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia) to trigger their uptake by epithelial cells and discuss their intracellular life-styles. During phagocytosis by phagocytes, bacteria play a passive role. In contrast during bacterial-induced phagocytosis, the bacterium is the key and active player in the complex interplay between the invading microbe and the host cell. Another critical element is the cytoskeleton whose plasticity is maximally exploited. After internalization, some bacteria remain in a vacuole, in which they replicate. They prevent the normal maturation and trafficking of the phagosome and impair its normal bacteriolytic activites. Other bacteria escape from the vacuole and replicate in the cytosol. In some cases, they also move and disseminate by means of an actin-based motility process. How the cell senses the bacterial intruders and adjust its transcription and translation programme to its new life with a parasite is an important issue. Apoptosis and anti-apoptosis, as well as cell cycle and inflammation related pathways, are reprogrammed after infection to help the cell to survive the stress induced by the infection. The success of an infection depends on the two messages that the two players -the bacterium and the cell-send to each other. At each step of the infectious process, the bacterium exploits the host machinery to its own profit. The two last decades have seen an accumulation of information concerning the molecular mechanisms underlying host-pathogens interactions during infection. A major issue is now to validate in vivo the molecular and cellular events analyzed in vitro. This raises the importance of having a relevant animal model. In some cases (e.g. Shigella) it is still lacking. In others, it is already existing or has been generated by use of sophisticated transgenesis approaches (e.g. Listeria).",

            "text": "There is no doubt that progress should be done to provide clues in the ongoing battle against bacterial diseases and for elaborating new therapeutic strategies. Pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is typically characterised by a narrow spectrum of micro-organisms and is dominated in older patients by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and a growing number of nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (NFGNB) have emerged as potential pathogens in CF lung disease. Several of these novel bacteria are naturally multiply resistant to antibiotics, cause chronic infection, and, although probably environmental in origin, are capable of patient-to-patient spread in the CF population. Several of the best known NFGNB in medical microbiology are considered ubiquitous. Organisms like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Stenotrophomonas, and Acinetobacter occur in a range of environmental and clinical niches and are metabolically and genetically versatile. In spite of their demonstrated potential for genetic adaptation and evolution, several clones of NFGNB are reported to occur in a very wide geographical area for prolonged periods of time. The considerable genomic versatility has allowed many of these NFGNB to occupy different environmental niches and to interact with their environment and hosts in several ways. The genus Burkholderia will be used to exemplify different types of environments and interactions. The accumulated evidence of reports of the natural behavior of near to forty Burkholderia species suggests that their ancestor was a soil bacterium that lived in close association with plants. Many plants leak nutrients in the rhizosphere environment to attract bacteria that protect them from harmful soil organisms, which include other bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. The Burkholderia ancestor and its offspring have developed a chemical warfare arsenal to compete for those nutrients present in the plant rhizosphere and interact with the plants through -among others -their nitrogen metabolism and the production of plant hormones. In this interaction process, burkholderias invaded the fungi of the plant mycorrhizal community, the root system, and the plant shoot tissues, and managed to colonize several ecosystems in the plant, thereby interacting mostly in a symbiotic manner with their hosts. Although we may know many isolation sites and sources for contamination of vulnerable patients, it is obvious that we only start to learn about the natural niche and the ecological role therein of many, if not most, of these NFGNB. One underlying reason is the heavily underestimated species richness in many of these groups of bacteria. Our knowledge of the biological diversity of several genera of NFGNB underwent dramatic changes during the past decades due to the detection of a large number of novel species, but also as a consequence of the criteria for bacterial genus and species delineation as established in the 1980s. Very often, this taxonomic complexity is associated with diagnostic problems. Recording this diversity will allow to design accurate identification procedures for those species that are of particular interest. Understanding the natural lifestyle of such organisms may however be instrumental to understanding their behavior in humans. The lecture will focus on the natural diversity of NFGNB which emerged as potential pathogens in CF lung disease. It will address the ecological role of these bacteria in the context of epidemiological investigations and will give an overview of recently developed identification tools.",

The clinical situation resembles the time when it was not realized, whether P. aeruginosa was a pathogen or merely an innocent colonizer of the respiratory tract of CF patients. Since the number of colonized/infected patients in each CF centre is restricted, and since co-infection is frequently present, the clinical dilemma whether to treat or not is difficult to solve.

Canepari (Verona, Genoa, I) Human pathogens are frequently transmitted from person-toperson, directly or via vectors/vehicles, thus perpetuating their parasitic cycle. However, they are also released into the environment, for example with faeces, where they encounter adverse conditions (oligotrophy, direct sunlight, extreme temperatures and salinity) which prevent cell division. Under stressing conditions, human pathogens and components of the normal microflora do not necessarily die but might persist even for long periods of time (several months) in that they are capable of activating a survival strategy known as the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. When in this phase, bacteria lose their ability to form colonies on culture media but are still viable and capable of metabolic activity and gene expression and show a specific protein profile and cell wall modifications. Moreover, VBNC cells, which are capable of maintaining their pathogenic potential (adhesion to animal tissues, toxin synthesis), may be able to resume division on returning to favourable environmental conditions such as those encountered in the human gut after ingestion of contaminated water or foods. A significant amount of data on VBNC bacterial forms derives also from our studies conducted on a waterborne pathogen such as Vibrio cholerae whose role as a seawater reservoir involved in cholera epidemics has been definitively demonstrated. Recently, using a vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis model, we have demonstrated that bacteria are capable of maintaining and expressing antibiotic resistance during the VBNC state and after resuming their divisional capability when permissive conditions are restored. On the basis of their characteristics, VBNC cells could therefore represent a potential risk for human health in that (i) they might constitute a reservoir of infectious and antibiotic-resistant bacterial forms involved in disease transmission and persistence, and (ii) they are undetectable with the standard culture methods. For this reason, for reliable evaluation of the microbiological quality of the environment is now mandatory to re-design the currently used procedures in order also to detect nonculturable bacteria. They express concern about European capacity to responding to such challenge. The picture gets grimmer when we know that the Rift Valley Fever (RVF), the dengue hemorragic fever, malaria, cholera, meningoccal meningitis, West Nile virus, are re-emerging worldwide. Half of the world population becomes at risk, and about 4 millions humans die per year (half under 5-year old). Increased migration, overuse of medicine in Europe, lack of medicine in the developing world, inappropriate funding do not facilitate proper responses to the challenge of control and prevention. Nevertheless since 1999, a French effort and a multidisciplinary consortium has been developing 'innovative international space monitoring and surveillance schemes'. The French space agency (CNES), along with experts on public health i.e. Institut Pasteur, national institute for agronomic research, institute for space medicine (MEDES), databases and environmental factors in-situ and from space (MEDIAS-France), have been implementing integrated on epidemiology based upon new technologies such as 'tele-medicine'. Following the Johannesburg Summit 2002, a new French project or 'RED GEMS' (Re-Emergent Diseases Global Environment Monitoring from Space), is born. Its two pillars i.e., teleepidemiology, and tele-medicine will enable real-time monitoring of human and animal data (epidemiology, clinical data, \u2026), socio-economical data (habitat, migration, turmoil, \u2026), biosphere (land cover, \u2026), hydrosphere (rainfall, stagnant waters, wind stress, sea surface temperature, altimetry, algae blooms, \u2026) and atmosphere (winds, convection, aerosols, \u2026). Products and databases accessible from a dedicated Website will be delivered to Early Warning Systems (EWS) and Health Information Systems (HIS) for effective disease control strategy. The EMERCASE project monitoring the RVF in Senegal, and the dengue fever project in French Guyana are already building blocks of 'RED GEMS'. Two other projects on cholera and meningococcal meningitis (type C) are under way. It is believed that this French initiative on space and public health will contribute to solving the new health challenge, to capacity building and multidisciplinary networking worldwide. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a fatal viral infection described in parts of Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Middle East. CCHF was first recognized during a large outbreak among agricultural workers in the mid 1940s in the Crimean peninsula, and a recent outbreak was reported from Turkey. The virus belongs to the genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family and causes severe diseases in humans, with the reported mortality rate of 3-30%. The mortality rate of CCHF virus (CCHFV) infection was lower in Turkey than the previously reported epidemics. Genetic analysis of the virus isolates from Turkey revealed a close relation with the isolates from former Yugoslavia and southwestern Russia. Humans become infected through the bites of ticks, by contact with a patient with CCHF during the acute phase of infection, or by contact with blood or tissues from viremic livestock. The occurrence of CCHF closely approximates the known world distribution of Hyalomma spp. ticks. After a short-incubation period, CCHF is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, dizziness, and myalgia. Additional symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and somnolence. In severe cases, haemorrhagic manifestations, ranging from petechiae to large areas of ecchymosis, develop. The levels of liver enzymes, creatinine phosphokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase are elevated, bleeding markers are elongated. In diagnosis, enzyme linked immunoassay and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are used. Treatment options for CCHF are limited. Ribavirin was suggested as an effective drug in recent studies, and it was found to be beneficial. No adverse event related to ribavirin therapy was noted. Based on our experiences in Turkey, ribavirin should be given to the patients suspected of CCHF infection who have severe thrombocytopenia, elevated ALT, AST, AST/ALT levels. The hospital health care workers (HCW) are under serious risk of transmission of the infection, particularly during the follow-up of the patient, with hemorrhages from the nose, mouth, gums, vagina, and injection sites. Simple barrier precautions were reported to be effective, but rigorously applied. Based on the results of our studies, we do not encourage prophylactic ribavirin use among HCWs, instead, in such cases, we suggest rigorous daily follow-up of the individual, by checking complete blood count, and biochemical tests if necessary.",

            "text": "Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever: laboratory diagnosis and epidemiology in Europe H. Zeller, M.C. Georges-Courbot (Lyon, F) Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe viral disease with a widespread distribution in subsaharian Africa and Madagascar, the Middle East, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Russia, Western part of China and some countries in Southern Europe (Kosovo, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, \u2026). The virus is able to produce severe human disease with high mortality rates (up to 30% in hospitalized patients). Due to the occurrence of nosocomial cases, CCHF virus is a major public health concern and is classified among the class 4 agents. The virus belongs to the family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus. It is transmitted by hard ticks (Hyalomma, Amblyomma, Dermacentor,\u2026 sp). The natural cycle involves small rodents, birds and domestic ruminants. Humans can be infected via tick bites which occur in during the peak activity of the vectors (from March to October in Southern Europe), or by direct contact with infectious blood products. Usually the incubation period in humans ranges from 3 to 7 days but can be shorter. Initial clinical symptoms are not specific: fever, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting; they precede the haemorrhagic phase. Laboratory findings show leucopenia (particularly neutropenia), thrombocytopenia, liver enzyme (AST/AST) and LDH elevations. The virological diagnosis includes the detection of CCHF viral genome by RT-PCR (semi-nested or real-time PCR) and/or detection of CCHF antigen, in association with serology (detection of CCHF IgM and IgG antibodies using ELISA or IFA). The viraemia may last up to 10-14 days, even in the presence of specific antibodies. New tools using recombinant antigens for CCHF antibodies detection are now available. Viral isolation attempts from blood samples can be conducted under biosafety level 4 conditions on VeroE6 cells. Phylogenic studies have shown a large diversity among CCHF viruses. Seven major genetic groups have been identified, based on analysis of a 260 bp of the S (small) segment coding for the nucleoprotein. Recent viral strains from the Balkans (Albania, Kosovo, Bulgaria) clustered in the same branch with some strains from Southern of Russia and strains from Turkey. A few studies were undertaken on the M (medium) and L (large) segments which encode for the glycoprotein precursor and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, respectively. The mortality rate associated with bacterial infections in the hospital is significant, and so are the related costs. Empirical antibiotic treatment that matches the in-vitro susceptibility of the pathogen (appropriate antibiotic treatment) and given early in the course of infection increases chances for survival. However, in only a small minority of patients the pathogen of infection or its susceptibilities are known on initiation of antibiotic treatment. For empirical treatment, the physician balances the antibacterial spectrum and activity of the drugs against their costs, adverse events, and their potential to induce resistance. Many times these calculations are wrong: about a third of patients are given inappropriate treatment, while about 20% are given superfluous drugs. In the TREAT project we built a computerized decision support system for prescription of antibiotic drugs. The TREAT system uses data on signs and symptoms, underlying conditions of the patient, laboratory and imaging results; and the distribution of pathogens and their susceptibility in the particular setting in which the patient acquired the infection, to assign probabilities to sites of infection, pathogens and their susceptibilities to antibiotics. It then balances the benefit associated with the different drugs or combinations of drugs against their costs, potential for side effects, and potential to induce resistance. A few of the system's features merit emphasis. First, it assigns a specific cost to induction of future resistance. We used local data, and data available from the literature, to draw a curve relating consumption to rise in resistance for each drug. To assign a cost to future resistance, we used a model similar to the one proposed to deal with optimal use of non-renewable resources Secondly, its core is a causal probabilistic network, which allowed us to combine knowledge and data from different sources in the same system. Last, it was built for easy calibration to new sites, by differentiating between universal factors (e.g., sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests); and local factors (e.g., distribution of pathogens and susceptibilities) that have to be calibrated anew at each site. The system was calibrated to three locations: Rabin Medical Center, Petah-Tiqva, Israel (Petah-Tiqva); Freiburg University Hospital, Freiburg, Germany (Freiburg); and A. Gemelli University Hospital, Catholic University, Rome, Italy (Rome); and tried in 2 phases, a non-interventional one; and a randomized controlled trial.",

            "text": "There is no vaccine for HCV and the only treatment which has proven efficacious is IFN-therapy. However, the success rate of this treatment is not satisfactory, thus there is a pressing need to develop prophylactic as well as therapeutic vaccines. HCV copes very well with the host's immune system. Once HCV enters the body, it is cleared naturally in a minority of cases. While most HCV infections do elicit immune responses, evidence of immunity is controversial. Obviously, an ideal vaccine should protect from infection in that it should elicit sterilising immunity. However, in the case of HCV where infection can only be assessed by PCR, a more realistic goal might be to look for vaccines capable of protecting from chronic infection. After all, HCV acute hepatitis is not a serious public health problem and most of us would be satisfied with a vaccine that allowed subclinical acute infection but which after a few months would be cleared by the immune response. Overall, our view is that a candidate HCV vaccine would be one that protects from infection and/or progression to chronic infection by the major genotypes. Our experience in chimpanzees demonstrates that a subunit vaccine composed by a recombinant form of the envelope glycoproteins can prime antibody and CD4+ T-cell responses that protect from chronic infection by heterologous HCV strains. Based on these results, we have now started prophylactic as well as therapeutic clinical trials for such a vaccine. Objectives: The causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is today the single greatest cause of mortality due to an infectious agents with 2 million people dying every year and 8 million new cases. The rising incidence of multi-resistance Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB) represent an additional problem to public health, with higher death-rates and the requirement for much more extensive antibiotic treatment. Routinely, mycobacterium infections are diagnosed by microscopic examination for the presence of acidfast bacilli (AFB) and by conventional culture techniques. Whereas AFB testing lack sensitivity, cultivation may take up to 2-4 weeks to determine the presence of mycobacterium due to the slow growth. Compared to culture, sensitivity using various nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) available is much lower. This may be due to either insufficient sample preparation from respiratory samples or incomplete lysis of the mycobacterium cells. Thus, the requirement for both a rapid and sensitive diagnostic system for TB is still largely unmet. Method: Here we present a new automated system for sample preparation of mycobacterium DNA from respiratory samples utilizing magnetic particles. In this system (chlamCAP, Genpoint, Norway), mycobacterium cells are initially adsorbed to uniquely coated paramagnetic particles and magnetically separated from the respiratory sample. A rapid lysis at RT releases DNA, which is then adsorbed onto the same magnetic particles. After washing, purified DNA is transferred microwells for NAAT analysis. Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) of the MTC group was spiked in growth medium and isolation was performed using the chlamCAP system on a Tecan Miniprep 75 customized to this particular application. Following isolation of mycobacterium DNA, the samples were analyzed by realtime PCR using primers specific for species belonging to MTC . Results: The sensitivity obtained was <103 CFU/ml (positive PCR signal) as determined by plating. In addition, results obtained from heat-inactivated sputum samples containing 50% sputasol from patients suspected to be infected with M. tuberculosis, were in agreement with data from cultivation, demonstrating the robustness of the chlamCAP system. Conclusion: Based on these results, we believe that the automated chlamCAP system in the future can promote the implementation of NAAT based methods in mycobacterium diagnostics, complementing today's enrichment systems. Objectives: Effective control of TB depends on rapid detection of links between patients with active disease. IS6110 RFLP cannot provide rapid results to direct control measures in outbreaks. MIRU-VNTR PCR typing of M. tuberculosis has comparable sensitivity to IS6110 RFLP. In July 2003, prospective MIRU-VNTR typing of all M. tuberculosis isolates received at Birmingham Regional Centre for Mycobacteriology was implemented to prospectively detect and confirm epidemiological links between patients with active TB disease. Methods: DNA was extracted from positive M. tuberculosis MGIT cultures. Novel oligos were designed to amplify the 3 ETR and the 12 MIRU-VNTR loci. 5 L of each PCR reaction was loaded onto a WAVE\u00d2 DNA Fragment Analysis System using the DNA Sizing programme. The gradient for separation was an 8.2-min gradient (20-900 bp) at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min at 50\u00b0C. Using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet the number of repeats at each locus was determined. IS6110 RFLP was performed on the largest MIRU-VNTR cluster using the standardised methodology. Conclusion: The high transmission rate and low median age in the Midlands, suggests newly acquired infection and not reactivation. Prospective MIRU-VNTR typing has detected a large previously unsuspected cluster and has allowed us to start to describe the epidemiology of TB in the Midlands.",

Methods: The mycolic acids from mycobacterial isolates growing on 7H11 agar plates and from positive VersaTREK myco bottles were extracted, derivatized and subjected to analysis by HPLC. The resulting chromatograms were analyzed using the MIDI database library to obtain a species identification. The resulting identifications were compared to those obtained by using nucleic acid probes and conventional biochemicals. Many of the isolates used in the investigation were previously vetted as to species identification. Results: Sixty-seven per cent of isolates tested from solid media were identified correctly to species. Twenty of 25 Mycobacterium avium complex isolates were identified correctly whereas none of the M. scrofulaceum isolates were identified to species owing to the absence of this organism from the database. Only 42.1% of the isolates obtained directly from positive VersaTREK myco bottles were identified correctly to species. A re-engineering of the database and a creation of a new library resulted in 90.1% of the isolates obtained from solid media and 82.9% of the isolates obtained from VersaTREK myco bottles being identified correctly. All 11 isolates of M. tuberculosis were identified correctly when tested directly from positive VersaTREK bottles using either library. Spontaneous rifampicin resistant mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain ATCC35801) were selected in vitro and the MIC of the resulting mutants measured for rifampicin and rifabutin. Of 105 colonies screened only a single mutant was isolated which was rifampicin resistant (MIC 32 lg/ml) but sensitive to rifabutin. The rpoB gene of this isolate was sequenced and found to contain a single C to T S522L mutation. This mutant was subjected to a second round of selection in parallel with the parent strain using rifabutin. The parent strain generated rifabutin resistant mutants with a frequency of 1.25 \u00b7 10 )7 colonies per CFU plated and the R190 (S522L) mutant generated rifabutin resistant mutants with a frequency of 1.93 \u00b7 10 )6 per CFU plated. Thus, spontaneous rifabutin mutants were generated by R190 with >15 times the frequency of the parent strain. DNA was extracted and the rpoB mutation hotspot region sequenced from twenty-six of these randomly selected rifabutin second round mutants. Additional mutations in the hot spot region of the rpoB gene were only detected in 12 of the 26 mutants studied; all isolates retained the original S522L mutation. Four strains had a mutation in codon 531, two in codon 526, four in codon 512 and two in codon 515. We did not detect any nucleotide changes in the mutT2, mutT4, or ogt gene regions previously suggested to be associated with a mutator phenotype. Selection of a mutator phenotype is recognised as a consequence of antibiotic challenge in many bacterial species, as the selection of strains with increased mutation frequencies will result in a greater chance of acquiring resistance to other drugs. The increased mutation frequency observed after selection with rifampicin suggests that mutator strains may also be relevant for the acquisition of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and may have serious implications for tuberculosis control.",

We conducted this populationbased cohort study to examine the effect of statin therapy on short-and long-term mortality in patients with bacteraemia. Methods: We retrieved all patients hospitalized with bacteraemia in North Jutland County, Denmark, from January 1997 to December 2002 from the County Bacteremia Registry. Using civil registry numbers, patients treated with statins were identified by record-linkage with the County Prescription Database. Mortality within 180 days after the bacteraemia was determined through the Central Population Registry. Mortality rates were compared for patients with and without statin therapy, adjusted for gender, age, comorbidity, use of antibiotic or immunosuppressive drugs, and focus of infection. Results: Among 5353 patients older than 15 years hospitalized with bacteraemia, 176 received statin therapy before admission. The 30-day mortality in statin users vs. non-users was similar (20.0% vs. 21.6%, adjusted mortality rate ratio (MRR) 0.9, 95% CI 0.7-1.3). Among survivors 30 days after the bacteraemia, however, statin therapy was associated with a substantial decrease in mortality during the subsequent period up till 180 days after the infection (8.4% vs. 17.5%, adjusted MRR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8). The tendency towards similar short-term mortality and decreased long-term mortality rates in statin users was observed in both community-acquired and nosocomial bacteraemia episodes, and for various microbiologic agents and foci of infection. When analyses were restricted to patients with a prior medical indication for statin use (ischemic heart disease, stroke, peripheral atherosclerosis, or diabetes), the adjusted 30-day MRR among statin users was 1.1 (95% CI 0.8-1.6), and the adjusted MRR from 30 to 180 days was 0.5 (95% CI 0.3-1.0). Conclusions: By contrast with previous smaller reports, in this population-based study statin use was not associated with a better prognosis within 30 days after an episode of bacteraemia, where most directly infection-related deaths may take place. Statins, however, seem to be associated with a substantially decreased long-term mortality after bacteraemia.",

            "text": "Role of guidelines in the management of severe sepsis and septic shock J.-L. Vincent (Brussels, B) Septic shock is a common condition on our ICUs associated with considerable morbidity and high mortality. Until relatively recently, management of the patient with septic shock has relied on infection eradication with anti-microbial agents and surgery where needed, adequate fluid resuscitation, and organ support. However, research into therapeutic strategies is intense and advances in management are moving fast. Physicians are confronted with a wealth of study data that they are expected to apply to daily clinical practice. And in this age of evidence-based medicine and quality-assurance, each decision has to be backed by a sound rationale. Clinical Guidelines, defined as \"systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances\",1 are designed to help clinicians achieve this goal, to assist in making appropriate decisions regarding management for individual patients. However, to be of any real value, guidelines need to be implemented and need to be flexible and adaptable. Medical research moves at a rapid pace and guidelines need to be continually updated as new discoveries are made and found, in high quality trials, to have an impact on outcomes. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign has recently published guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock,2 which include, among others, recommendations on appropriate antibiotic therapy, endpoints of fluid resuscitation, vasopressor preference, stress-dose steroid therapy for septic shock, use of recombinant activated protein C, and importance of blood glucose levels. Importantly, though, and unlike previous guidelines, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign has combined the development of the guidelines with a process to encourage their implementation and to assess the impact of the guidelines on mortality reduction. An annual update of the guidelines is also promised. Such evolving guidelines will help clinicians to apply results from the ever-increasing mass of literature and data to provide quality standard of care for their patients. Methods: Since 1988 all methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates, both from infection and colonization cases, has been referred to and stored at the Staphylococcus Laboratory, Statens Serum Institut for national surveillance and since 1999 hospital discharge summaries or general practitioner records providing clinical and epidemiological data has retrospectively been obtained on all patients. Based on this information each case has been categorized as infection or colonisation as well as the probable source of acquisition giving the following catagories for infections: IMP: acquired outside Denmark; HA: Hospital acquired infection; CO: Community onset MRSA infection; CO-Health care associated (CO-HCA): patient has been hospitalized within the last 12 months; CO-community risk (CO-CR): close contact to another patient with a community acquired MRSA infection; CO-No Risk (CO-NR): No Risk factor has been identified. CA: Community acquired = CO-CR and CO-NR patients. All isolates has been subjected to PFGEaccording to the harmony protocol, phagetyping and resistogram for 12 antibiotics. Presence of the mecA gene was confirmed with the EVIGENE kit. Results: A total of 618 MRSA was found in the period. 131 were found by screening (will not be considered further) leaving 487 cases of infection. The number of infections increased from 54 in 1999 to 201 in 2003. In the same period the number of CO isolates increased from 26 to 113 (56%) of infections. In 2003, 17 patients had a community risk whereas 47 did not have any identified risk factors. Throughout the period ST80-IV accounted for 49% of CO-MRSA infections. Skin and soft tissue infections dominated CA-MRSA (82% vs 17% in HA infections). Conclusions: The prevalence of MRSA has been very low in Denmark for more than 20 years. However, the number of cases is now increasing and the epidemiology of MRSA is changing towards primary acquisition within Denmark and community-onset infections, most of them without identifiable risk factors associated with previous health care. The ST80-IV clone has successfully established itself in the Danish community. However, the recent increase in MRSA infections is not due to the ST80-IV clone, which may indicate that new, well-adapted clones are now evolving in Denmark.",

Methods: The isolates were reanalyzed using multilocus sequencing analysis (MLST), staphylococcus cassette chromosome mec typing (SCCmec) and AFLP. Results: All isolates were of the same sequence and SCCmec type, the novel ST125-IV. The AFLP analysis revealed a homology between the isolates of the first period (1999) (2000) to be approximately 97%, and the homology between all isolates to approximately 89%. Conclusion: The MRSA clones have survived in one or both of the nursing homes during a time period of 3-4 years, only having evolved slightly. ST125-IV has also been discovered in northern Norway and in a Spanish university hospital at Tenerife. In the Spanish hospital ST125-IV was first discovered in 2001, increasing rapidly and represented 22.8% of the clones in 2002. To our knowledge ST125-IV has not been discovered elsewhere. The ST125-IV clones are nearly related to ST5-IV, 'pediatric clone', differing with only one basepair in the yqiL allele. This might indicate that the strain has evolved from ST5-IV in Norway and spread to Tenerife e.g. by tourism. Another scenario is that the point mutation in the yqiL allele has occurred in several ST5 clones. The MRSA clones with sequence type 125-IV have shown the ability to establishment itself as an endemic strain in health institution environments, both in Norway and Spain. In 2002, a cluster of five CAMRSA isolates was found to be ST150, which could be further divided into two clones, ST150-MRSA-IIIC and ST150-MRSA-IIID. The year after, another two ST150-MRSA-IIIC isolates were detected in the same area. ST154-MRSA-IV was another new clone found in the study and so far only one strain belonged to this clone. Type IV was the most common SCCmec type in the study, which accounted for 63% of these strains and was present in diverse genetic backgrounds. Three new SCCmec types were observed in the study, i.e. SCCmec I variant, IIIC and IIID. Twenty-three of the 38 CAMRSA isolates (61%) harboured the pvl genes, while no pvl genes were detected in hospital clones of MRSA under the period. However, the percentage of pvl-positive isolates among these community isolates of MRSA has declined by years, which was 91%, 57% and 36% in 2001, 2002 and 2003, respectively. In the present study, most CAMRSA strains (95%) were nonmultiresistant except clone ST59-MRSA-IIIC, which was coresistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Conclusions: The present study reveals the genetic diversity of CAMRSA strains in the southern Stockholm area and emphasizes the importance of typing in tracing the origin of isolates for controlling their spread in community. Methods: Identification and oxacillin resistance were confirmed by triplex PCR for 16S rRNA, nuc and mecA genes. PVL genes (lukS-lukF) were tested by PCR. PVL-positive strains were genotyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) after SmaI macrorestriction, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) typing, spa sequence typing and MLST. The accessory gene regulator (agr) polymorphism was determined by PCR. Susceptibility to 16 antimicrobials was determined by disk diffusion method. Results: Among 65 putative CA-MRSA strains collected from 2002 to 2004, 15 isolates harboured lukS-lukF genes encoding the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin. By molecular typing, they belonged to PFGE type X1 ST80-SCCmec IV (n = 6), X2 ST80-SCCmec IV (n = 4), J4 ST30-SCCmecIV (n = 2), A23 ST8-SCCmec IV (n = 2) and Y1 new ST-SCCmec IV (n = 1). Strains had an agr type 3 (n = 13) or type 1 (n = 2) genotype. Strains were resistant to tetracycline (64%), fusidic acid (57%) and kanamycin (36%) and susceptible to other antimicrobial drugs including the quinolones. The mean age of patients with PVL-MRSA isolates was 26 years (range 1-70). All but one infections were community-acquired. including with skin or soft tissue infections (n = 13), bacteraemia (n = 1) and peritonitis (n = 1). One patient had skin colonisation. Five patients had previous beta-lactam therapy. Two cases were travel associated. Conclusions: These results showed the emergence and importation in Belgium of PVL-positive CA-MRSA strains belonging to four MLST clones. CA-MRSA strains of genotype ST8-SCCmec IV and ST30-SCCmec IV were closely related with nosocomial PVL-negative strains. Strains were susceptible to most non beta-lactam antimicrobials except tetracycline, kanamycin and fusidic acid. PVL-positive strains caused skin or soft-tissue infections and rarely systemic infections. Surveillance should be intensified to monitor the incidence of MRSA and control its spread in the community. Methods: The PVL-MRSA isolates were obtained from clinics (40%), outpatient clinics (35%), and patients visiting general practitioners (25%). A multiplex PCR was used for the detection of PVL positive MRSA strains. The PCR detects not only the PVL loci, but also confirms the presence of the mecA gene and a S. aureus specific DNA fragment. Molecular typing also included pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST Objectives: To follow-up the identification of MRSA isolates carrying the exfoliative toxin A (ETA) gene in patients associated with a community maternity hospital near Aberdeen. Methods: We searched the SMRL database for isolates phenotypically and genotypically similar to those identified, characterised them further and looked at the clinical records of the patients. Results: The index isolates were from skin infections in 1 adult and 7 babies. They had a characteristic PFGE pattern which resembled that of the US Paediatric Clone; this association was confirmed by MLST (ST5) and SCCmec (IV) typing. Toxin PCR showed that the isolates had the genes for ETA and enterotoxin D (SED) but not exfoliative toxin B (ETB) or Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). Of the 55,000 isolates in the database, 110, nearly all referred from the Aberdeen Laboratory, resembled the index isolates. Of these, 60, mostly isolated in 2003 or 2004, were available for further testing. Nearly all these isolates were positive for the SED gene, about 60% were positive for the ETA gene and all were negative for the ETB and PVL genes. All the ETA positive isolates (and many of the SED positive, ETA negative ones) had closely related PFGE patterns but they were not all identical. The earliest isolate with the ETA toxin gene had been isolated from a wound swab taken in the community in 1998. The patients with the ETA positive isolates fell into three groups: (1) associated with the maternity hospital; (2) injecting drug users in the community; (3) hospital patients with clinical histories typical of those with hospital acquired strains. Conclusions: We have shown that a phenotypically distinct group of ST5, SCCmec IV MRSA isolates carrying the ETA gene has been present in the Grampian region of Scotland for more than 5 years. Isolates have been present both in the community and in hospital patients; very similar isolates without the ETA gene have also been found. The ETA gene is usually carried on a plasmid and it is possible that the 'outbreak strain' has been generated on more than one occasion. As the strain is so widespread, attempts to contain it have been limited to the standard policy of decolonisation after treatment of any infection. Objectives: World-wide an increasing number patients with MRSA are found in the community. We report a smaller hospital outbreak caused by a strain of increasing prevalence in the community and most likely transmitted in the hospital by a healthy carrier. Methods: The Infection Control unit at Sahlgrenska University hospital has been responsible for typing all MRSA strains isolated in the region as well as investigating epidemiological relationships of all possible outbreaks of MRSA since 1983. Strains are designated according to phenotypic characteristics, antibiograms and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)patterns. To enable investigation of relationships between strains at the national level MRSA strains are further typed at SMI. Results: Within a 2-month period in spring 2003 three women cared for in one of our maternity clinics were infected with the same MRSA strain, two developed febrile infection. Their newborns were later found to be throat carriers with this strain. No epidemiological relationship could be established between the mothers at that point. Co-patients and~90 employees were screened for carriage but none was found positive. A year later one additional mother developed mastitis with the same strain. Her baby was also found to be a throat carrier. Among co-patients and 200 personnel cultured, this time also including the staff at the neonatal unit, one doctor was found to be heavily colonised with the MRSA strain in question. The doctor was later found to have been involved in the care of all four neonates. The strain is sequence type (ST) 45, SCCmec IV, PVL-toxin negative MRSA strain with additional resistance only to tetracycline. It belongs to a clone with Berlin IV-like pattern on PFGE, widely spread both in Sweden and Denmark and presently increasing particularly in the community in Sweden. Conclusion: It has not been possible to establish where and when the doctor was infected. Apart from being health personnel, no risk factors for MRSA carriage were encountered. Transmission most likely occured from healthy neonates to the breastfeeding mothers and not vice versa as initially believed. The extremely low prevalence of MRSA in Scandinavia, in Sweden <600 cases/year, makes it unlikely that the mothers, babies and the doctor have separate routes of transmission. The increase of MRSA in the community raises the questions of who and when to screen patients and employees to prevent spread of MRSA in hospitals.",

            "text": "Objectives: The nosocomial prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Portugal was stable and estimated around 50% during the last decade. During this period there were successive waves of dominant MRSA clones in Portuguese hospitals, namely the Iberian (ST247-SCCmec IA), Brazilian (ST239-III) and EMRSA-15 (ST22-IV) clones. In order to understand the origins of these nosocomial major MRSA clones, we compared the genetic background of MRSA from three hospitals with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates from those hospitals and from the community where they were located. Methods: A total of 238 MSSA isolates, including 141 nosocomial and 97 community isolates, were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Representatives of each PFGE pattern were studied by spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Nosocomial isolates were recovered from three hospitals and the community isolates were recovered from healthy children attending day care centres and from draftees. Results: The 238 MSSA isolates were grouped into 18 clones, of which 13 were present in both nosocomial and community settings. Half of the isolates belonged to three major clonal types: clone A (PFGE type A, spa type 33 or related, ST30), clone B (PFGE type B, spa type 295 or related, ST34) and clone C (PFGE type C, spa type 2 or related, ST5). Clone A, corresponds to a slight variation (MLST single locus variant) of the genetic background of the international MRSA clone EMRSA-16 (ST36-II) and clone C corresponds to the background of the New York/Japan (ST5-II) and Pediatric (ST5-IV) clones. To the best of our knowledge, the former two clones have never been detected in Portugal. However, the Pediatric clone was first described in a pediatric Portuguese hospital. Interestingly, the genetic backgrounds correspondent to the dominant MRSA clones in Portuguese hospitals (Iberian, Brazilian and EMRSA-15) were scarcely or not found among the present MSSA collection. Conclusions: The Iberian, Brazilian and EMRSA-15 clones, which are the three major MRSA clones detected in Portuguese hospitals during the last decade, seem to have not originated from the introduction of SCCmec into dominant MSSA backgrounds present in the Portuguese nosocomial or community environment suggesting they were imported from abroad. In contrast, the MRSA Pediatric clone might have originated in our country by the acquisition of SCCmec type IV into MSSA clone C. Objectives: To evaluate trends in MRSA bacteraemia after the introduction of a nosocomial MRSA control system. Methods: The study was of the before -after type. It was conducted at the hospital of Cremona -850 bed community hospital -with intensive care unit (ICU), vascular surgery, neurosurgery, bone marrow transplant, and AIDS units. The study was performed in a hyperendemic setting, with a prevalence of methicillin resistance (MR) among nosocomial Staphylococcus aureus above 50%. Among all the hospitalized patients, MRSA bacteraemia was identified, origin of bacteraemia defined, and incidence rate calculated as per ward (ICU, surgical, or medical) and per origin (primary, central venous catheter -CVC -surgery, etc.). The MRSA control programme implemented, was based mainly on active identification of colonized patients through surveillance cultures, and isolation with contact precautions for all MRSA positive patients. Results: From January 1,1996 through December 31, 2001, 69 MRSA bacteraemia were identified. When comparing the preintervention period, 1/1996 -6/1997, with 1/2000 -12/2001, the incidence rate of MRSA bacteraemia was reduced from 0.62 to 0.32 per 1000 admissions (relative risk (RR) = 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.28-0.96; p = 0.03). The effects were most striking in ICU, with an 89% reduction (RR = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.01-0.98; p = 0.03) and in CVC-related bacteraemia with an 82% decrease (RR = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05-0.55; p = 0.002). Methicillin resistance among blood isolates decreased from 46% to 17% (RR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.22-0.62; p = 0.0005). Conclusions: A reduction in MRSA bacteraemia may be achieved through control of MRSA transmission in hospitals with very high MR prevalence. Patients in ICU and with a CVC may benefit the most from 'search and isolates' control interventions. Objective: Measure the efficiency of a new automated nucleic acid extraction system (NucliSens easyMAG, bioM\u00e9rieux) for various clinical samples as compared to a reference extraction system. Methods: 140 individual clinical samples (including plasma, serum, CSF, blood, stool, and sputum samples) were spiked with Phocine herpesvirus-1 (PhHV). Extracted samples were subjected to real time PCR to determine the extraction efficiency of the NucliSens easyMAG and compare it to a manual magnetic silica method (NucliSens miniMAG, bioM\u00e9rieux). Next, serial dilutions of M. bovis were prepared in sputum to compare the extraction efficiency of both systems with a second model system. Run controls were included to measure the reproducibility. Carry over was addressed by processing highly positive samples in between negative samples. For the easyMAG method two different workflows were tested, lysis on board and lysis off board. Results: PhHV DNA was detected in 96% (easyMAG) and 97% (miniMAG) of the samples when tested undiluted and was detected in all samples when tested 5-fold diluted. In total 6/20 (easyMAG) and 4/20 (miniMAG) stool samples were not detected when tested undiluted, for all other sample types 100% detection was measured. Mean Ct values were 27.7 \u00b1 2.5 (easyMAG) and 27.6 \u00b1 2.3 (miniMAG) for undiluted samples and 29.4 \u00b1 1.8 (easyMAG) and 29.5 \u00b1 2.0 (miniMAG) for 5-fold diluted samples. The calculated 50% hit rate obtained with M. bovis PCR was found at dilution 1:14,000 (easyMAG) and 1:17,000 (miniMAG). Both systems showed good reproducibility on the run controls, and no carry over was detected. Ct values of extracted control samples (easyMAG 25.6 \u00b1 0.4, miniMAG 26.0 \u00b1 0.6) were comparable to values obtained with PCR controls not subjected to extraction (PCR 25.8 \u00b1 0.3). Regarding the two different workflows, Ct values measured were comparable for, respectively, the off board and on board lysis; undiluted 26.7 \u00b1 1.6 and 26.9 \u00b1 1.4, diluted 29.0 \u00b1 1.4 and 29.3 \u00b1 1.5. Conclusions: In this study, for all samples tested, the new extraction system NucliSens easyMAG performs equal as compared to manual magnetic silica extraction (NucliSens miniMAG) that was used as reference. This means that both platforms are interchangeable. For both systems inhibition was observed in some of the stool samples when tested undiluted, but PhHV DNA was well detected when these samples were tested diluted. No inhibition was observed in any of the other sample types included in this study. Objectives: Rapid identification of bacterial pathogens is crucial to manage efficient pathogen-adapted antimicrobial therapy. Current problems for pathogen detection in human samples with low bacterial load are patients under antibiotic pretreatment, non-cultivable microorganisms and a time-to-result delay of more than 4 days. Previous studies with patients of intensive care units showed that 80-90% of blood cultures fail to detect the triggering pathogen. Therefore, culture independent detection methods take a centre stage in scientific interest. However, compared to bacterial culture techniques, the sensitivity of molecular biological methods like PCR is inadequate. Here, we developed a method for the specific separation and concentration of prokaryotic DNA from eukaryotic environment, to enable culture independent molecular biological methods with significant increased sensitivity. Methods: A protein (P-181) was identified that has a specific binding affinity for pro-karyotic DNA. P-181 was expressed in Escherichia coli. Validating the properties of P-181, we used spiked blood samples. Total DNA, isolated by means of phenol/ chloroform extraction, was given to a column packed with P-181 immobilized to a special matrix. The separation of prokaryotic DNA was monitored by measurement of optical density and special PCR-techniques. After the enrichment of prokaryotic DNA, a PCR was performed to detect bacterial DNA. The amplicons were sequenced for identification of the pathogen. Results: We showed that prokaryotic DNA is specifically retained by immobilised P-181. We successfully separated the DNA of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in spiked blood samples. In a current clinical pilot study, we were able to detect bacterial DNA with different sequences in the 16SrRNA-gene in some whole blood samples from septic patients despite the corresponding blood cultures showed negative results. Conclusion: The developed method offers a unique opportunity for concentration of prokaryotic DNA from human samples with low bacterial load, tissue or other clinical samples. This preanalytic procedure leads to an increased sensitivity of culture independent methods of bacteria detection in usually sterile clinical samples by means of common PCR protocols. Objectives: The gold standard for the diagnosis of adenovirus (AV) infection is culture. However, results are available after days to weeks and not all AV types grow in culture. Especially in immune compromised patients severe infections with AV are described and a rapid diagnosis would be important. Therefore, an AV real-time PCR was developed, detecting all 51 known AV serotypes. Methods: Primers were chosen in the hexon region. In order to cover all 51 serotypes the forward primer is degenerated at three positions and the reverse primer at two positions. The internal control (IC) DNA contains the same primer binding sites, but has a shuffled probe region compared to WT virus. The IC DNA was added to the clinical sample in order to monitor extraction and PCR efficiency. Twelve (2-fold) serial dilutions were made from AV DNA and IC DNA in a background of AV negative throat fluid in order to assess the detection limit of the AV PCR. To investigate the linearity, 8 (ten-fold) serial dilutions from AV DNA (with 1000 copies IC DNA in every dilution) in a background of AV negative sputum were tested. A panel of AV prototype strains of all 51 AV serotypes, kindly provided by Dr J. de Jong, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, was tested. To establish the clinical utility of the assay, a comparison of AV PCR and culture was performed in a panel of 157 clinical samples (90 faeces samples, 56 respiratory materials, 8 serum/plasma samples, three other materials). Results: In the serial dilutions in throat fluid the 50% detection limit of AV DNA was 8 copies per PCR assay (400 copies/ml) and of IC DNA 16 copies per PCR assay (800 copies/ml). The real-time AV PCR was linear from 125 copies per PCR assay (6250 copies/ml) until 1.25 E8 copies per PCR assay (6.25 E9 copies/ml). All 51 AV serotypes were detected in the panel of AV prototype strains. Concordant results between culture or Ag detection and PCR were found in 138/157 (87.9%). In 10 cases, PCR was positive while culture or Ag was negative (6.4%). In one case, PCR was negative while culture was positive (0.6%) and in 8 cases PCR was negative without culture or Ag data Conclusion: A sensitive AV real-time PCR assay was developed, detecting all 51 AV serotypes. The assay can be applied on different body fluids, among which faeces and respiratory materials. The assay has proven to be more rapid and more sensitive than AV culture. Objectives: Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter jejuni are the major causes of bacterial gastro-enteritis in The Netherlands. Conventional diagnosis is based on detection of both species in feces and consists of enrichment, selective culture and identification, which can take several days. Introduction of a PCR based screening of feces is cost-effective (ICAAC 2004 poster O-1626) and will decrease the turn around time significantly. However in this approach a sensitive PCR method is mandatory. This study describes the development of real-time PCR based methods for the direct detection of Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni in feces.",

The DNA extraction was validated in recovery experiments and the PCR assays were validated with culture positive [n = 229 (Salmonella spp.), n = 172 (C. jejuni)] and culture negative [n = 191 (Salmonella spp.), n = 224 (C. jejuni)] fecal specimens. Results: In a panel of 136 fecal samples, the 'in-house' fecal DNA extraction performed with a high average recovery (97%) compared to miniMAG (70%) and MagNA Pure DNA III (64%). No samples proved troublesome (i.e. recovery <50%), whereas 16% and 27% scored lower recoveries (0-38%) with the commercial kits. However, final PCR results were only slightly influenced by low recoveries. Analytical sensitivities were determined at 500 CFU and 100 CFU/g feces for Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni respectively. In clinical fecal specimens sensitivity and specificity were 92%, 99% for Salmonella spp., and 96%, 96% for C. jejuni respectively. PCR inhibition was only observed in 0.15% of the samples. Conclusion: Sensitive and cost effective molecular screening of fecal specimens for Salmonella spp. and C. jejuni is feasible and has great potential as a means of rapid detection of bacterial gastro-enteritis.",

A recently introduced new rapid immunoassay (immunocard toxins A and B, Meridian) and an in-house developed real-time PCR were compared in a prospective multicentre study with conventional diagnostics. Methods: In a prospective study of 4 months, 3 university hospitals participated and tested all faecal samples from patients with diarrhoea admitted to the hospital for 3 days or longer for CDAD, irrespective of the physicians request. A conventional enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA, Vidas CDA2) was used for detection of TcdA and the cytotoxicity assay on Vero-cells was applied as the gold standard. Additionally, the immunocard toxins A and B (ICTAB) and a real-time PCR for the detection of tcdB were included in the study (FICDS, abstr. p. 22, 2004) . The sensitivity of the real-time PCR was 1 colony forming unit (CFU) in 0.9% saline and 2800 CFU/g faeces. Results: Of 471 faecal samples from patients with diarrhoea, 102 (21.7%) were excluded due to a lack of sufficient material for all assays. Of 369 samples included, 75 (20.3%) showed a positive test result in one or more assays. The cytotoxicity test was positive for CDAD in 23 (6.2%) of 369 patients. Of 23 patients with a positive cytoxicity assay, the diagnosis CDAD was not considered in 10 (43%) by the physician. Using the cytotoxicity assay as the gold standard, sensitivity of ELFA, ICTAB and real-time PCR were 69.6%, 91.3% and 87.0%, respectively. The specificity of ELFA, ICTAB and real-time PCR were 95.4%, 96.2% and 95.4%, respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value for ELFA, ICTAB, real-time PCR were 50% and 97.9%, 61.8% and 99.4%, and 55.6% and 99.1%, respectively. Culture of two discordant samples only positive by real-time PCR showed the presence of toxinogenic CD in both samples. Culture of five samples only positive in ICTAB revealed no toxinogenic CD. Conclusions: The newly introduced rapid immunoassay is a very rapid and easy-to-perform test for the diagnosis of CDAD. It may be useful for guiding appropriate treatment. The realtime PCR is an excellent instrument to control nosocomial spread of toxinogenic C. difficile.",

            "text": "Objectives: In April 2004, residents and staff in a nursing home in south-east Austria fell ill with vomiting and diarrhoea: The index case was an 85-year-old man with clinical onset on April 27th. During the following days an increased number of cases with diarrhoea and vomiting among residents and stuff was observed. The outbreak peaked on May 7th. We describe the outbreak and its epidemiological investigation. Methods and Results: At the time of the outbreak 77 persons aged 62-96 years lived in the nursing home and up to 44 staff members worked there. To stop the spread of the disease, all residents were invited taking their meals in their rooms instead of in the common dining room. Common social activities were restrained. Since all meals were prepared in the residential kitchen, water and food were sampled for routine testing of infectious agents (not including norovirus); all results were negative. Testing of stool samples for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, adenovirus and cryptosporidia was also negative. These results raised the suspicion that norovirus was the causative organism in this outbreak. No indication of norovirus as causative agent could be found in the stool samples either by electron microscopy, or with routine RT-PCR in the polymerase gene of norovirus (ORF1). Finally, analysis with real time RT-PCR in the capsid region (ORF2) of the virus genome could identify norovirus of the genogroup II (GG II) as causative agent; detection was possible using a TaqMan probe. Nursing administration provided lists of residents and staff with corresponding symptoms and days of sickness for epidemiological evaluation; the attack rate (AR) was 52% for the residents. Five of the 40 residents affected had 2 episodes of illness and 2 residents had 3 episodes; the AR of personnel was 27.3% without any relapses. None of the kitchen staff became ill. Conclusion: This outbreak demonstrates that in order to evaluate an outbreak with suspected norovirus involvement, molecular virus identification of 2 different genomic regions may occasionally be useful, especially when clinical symptoms and epidemiological features of the disease indicate norovirus infection as its cause. Methods: Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from children with symptomatic respiratory tract infections but negative for common viral respiratory pathogens were stored at )80\u00b0C until analysis. Patient age ranged from 10 days to 12 years. NPA were defrosted, washed and spiked with an exogenous RNA transcript prior to RNA extraction. All extracts were tested in duplicate, both by an in-house developed real-time RT-PCR assay and by another recently described real-time RT-PCR assay. The in-house assay is based on TaqMan MGB probes directed to conserved sequences located in the nucleoprotein gene. Results: All specimens tested were adequate as monitored by detection of the spiked RNA transcript. HMPV RNA was detected in 13 of 93 specimens (14%) by both real-time RT-PCR assays. Eleven of these children were admitted with a variety of respiratory symptoms ranging from cough to pneumonia. One child presented with fever, the other one was diagnosed with rachitis. The majority of children with a positive HMPV assay (10/13) was less than 2 years old, the oldest child with a positive HMPV assay was twelve. Remarkably, 10 of these 13 HMPVpositive specimens were clustered in a 2 weeks time period, strongly suggesting the occurrence of an epidemic outbreak. Whereas Ct values varied from less than 20 up to almost 40, differences in Ct values between both assays were not significant. Two other specimens from children admitted with symptoms of gastroenteritis were weakly positive with the previously described assay alone, albeit in just one of the duplicate reactions. Conclusions: Real-time RT-PCR may prove to be a rapid, convenient and reliable method to detect the presence of HMPV RNA in NPA from children with acute respiratory infections. Further clinical validation in a prospective study is in progress. diseases often makes a specific diagnosis difficult. The etiological agent and type of infection can determine potential prognoses as well as optimal treatment for the patient. Unfortunately, laboratory tests used for the diagnosis of CNS infections have the disadvantage of being either nonsensitive or nonspecific or giving results difficult to distinguish from the norm. With the advent of molecular diagnostic protocols, it is now possible to diagnose viral pathogens specifically and with high sensitivity and accuracy. Materials and Methods: The LightCycler Real-time PCR technology was used to analyse 70 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens collected from 61 patients with encephalitis and/or meningitis and 9 patients with acute neurological symptoms. DNA was extracted from the CSF samples (1000 ll) using the MagNa Pure robot and eluted in a final volume of 100 ll, therefore achieving 10-fold DNA concentration. The DNA samples were analysed using 5 Real-time PCR protocols in a single LightCycler run (30 min) for the parallel detection of 6 herpes viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, CMV, EBV and HHV-6). Results: Herpes-type specific plasmid dilutions were amplified to produce external standard curves for accurate PCR product quantification. Following HSV amplification, HSV-1 and HSV-2 differentiation was performed by LightCycler melting curve analysis, which detects sequence differences between the PCR product and hybridisation probe: this results in a shift in the probe melting temperature (57\u00b0C for HSV-1 and 67\u00b0C for HSV-2). Viral DNA was detected in 13 of the 70 CSF samples: 4 were positive for HSV-1, 1 for HSV-2, 5 for VZV and 3 for HHV-6. The levels of quantified DNA varied from 100 to 22,630 copies/ml. In one case, 4800 VZV DNA copies per ml were detected in the CSF of a young woman (18 years) suffering from Runsay-Hunt syndrome: the patient was successfully treated with acyclovir. The combined use of an automated extraction procedure and rapid LightCycler PCR allowed a turn-around-time (TAT) of 90-120 min to be achieved. Conclusion: These results suggest that the LightCycler Realtime PCR platform offers a fast, highly automated, sensitive and reproducible tool for the accurate quantitation of six herpes virus DNAs in CSF samples with a TAT of less than 2 h. Objectives: The Dutch national surveillance on the prevalence of resistance is based on first isolates per patient and therefore unable to detect resistance development during hospitalisation. Our aim was to design an analysis of surveillance data that reveals to what extent hospital stay contributes to the development of resistance to single as well multiple antimicrobial classes (AC) in pathogens isolated from patients during hospitalisation. Methods: Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) isolates (blood, respiratory tract, wound or pus) cultured from hospitalized patients and processed in one of 8 regional laboratories covering 27% of the Dutch population in the years 1996/1997 and 2001/2002 were studied. The percentage of patients who had acquired an (intermediate) resistant isolate was determined up to15 days, starting the first day (day 0) when a KP was isolated from a patient. This percentage was calculated for day 0 and for each subsequent 3-days interval. Per interval only 1 random isolate per patient was included if available. Results: In 1996/1997, resistance percentages during hospitalization to amoxi-clav, third gen. cephalosporins and gentamicin remained stable while non-susceptibility to cotrimoxazole and ciprofloxacin rose 2.5-fold and 4-fold respectively (Table) . Multidrug resistance (MDR; I/R to at least 2 AC) reached a maximum of 11% of isolates tested 4-6 days after the day 0 ( Fig.) . In 2001/2002, however, resistance to any single AC increased 3-to 5-fold during hospitalization and after one week 50% of isolates were resistant to two or more AC, of which half were resistant to all 5 AC tested.",

The analysis used in this study provides better insight in the resistance prevalence inside hospitals than an analysis based solely on first isolates and is a useful tool to monitor resistance development during hospitalization. Objectives: Worldwide increases in the prevalence of multidrugresistant (MDR)-SP demonstrate the importance of surveillance initiatives such as the GLOBAL Surveillance to monitor changes in the in vitro activity of important antimicrobial agents. The USFDA has recognized the importance of MDR among S. pneumoniae (SP) and approved an MDR-SP indication for levofloxacin and more recently, gemifloxacin. Methods: The GLOBAL Surveillance initiative includes 15,878 non-repeat SP strains collected from patients in fourteen countries worldwide from 1999 through 2004. All isolated were susceptibility tested in a central laboratory using NCCLS standards. Data were used to investigate MDR [resistance (R) to \u20213 among penicillin (PEN), ceftriaxone (CTX), azithromycin (AZI), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and levofloxacin (LFX)] trends and phenotypes Results: From 1999 to 2004, the prevalence of MDR strains ranged between 11.4% and 12.5%. Regardless of year or country, the most prevalent MDR phenotype was R to PEN, AZI, and SXT. Globally, LFX R was rarely associated with MDR with over 96% of MDR strains remaining susceptible. On a country basis for 2003-2004, the highest MDR rates were observed in Thailand (23.1%), South Korea (47.8%), and Hong Kong (44.0%); LFX R as part of the MDR phenotype remained low in these countries (1.6%, 1.0%, and 5.3%, respectively). The lowest MDR rates were observed in Germany (0.9%), United Kingdom (1.2%), and Belgium (1.6%). Overall among the MDR isolates collected, 92.6% were R to 3 agents, and 7.4% were R to 4 agents. No 5 drug-resistant MDR SP were encountered. Conclusions: The MDR phenotype among SP is prevalent worldwide and most frequently involves resistance to betalactams, macrolides and SXT. Currently, and especially in EU countries, fluoroquinolone R is rarely associated with the MDR phenotype. However, the potential for this to emerge underscores the need for continued surveillance and new agent development.",

The city is located in southeastern Brazil and has around 10,000,000 inhabitants. Routine outpatient culture results for bacterial pathogens isolated from respiratory tract between 2002 and 2004 were entered in the database and geocoded in a digital map containing different information categories (layers). Spatial analysis technique used was Kernel function method (TerraView 3.01, INPE, Brazil) to analyse total sample and cases distribution. Comparisons between both patterns were done to explore possible cluster formations. Results: Five thousand and fourteen (5014) respiratory tract cultures (one patient per day) were performed during the period, which yielded 725 isolates of H. influenzae and 295 of S. pneumoniae. So far 1795 occurrences were geocoded, with 243 (13.5%) H. influenzae and 111 (6.2%) S. pneumoniae. Of those, 11 H. influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase producers and 7 S. pneumoniae were intermediate or resistant to penicillin. A nonrandom pattern of total sample, H. influenzae, and S. pneumoniae distributions was observed, probably meaning higher population density. Early evidence of independent clusters was detected. Conclusions: Kernel function is an easy-to-use and initial exploratory technique for interpolating and smoothing point events and it identifies possible clusters. However, it only considers the sampled population (biased samples influence result). Independent clusters of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae is possible but needs further investigations.

There is a peak level of penicillin resistance associated with cumulative exposure to a combination of antibiotic classes. It may be possible for countries with low levels of penicillin resistance under a specific steady-state situation to retain that condition for a long period of time. For other countries reduction of consumption alone may not result in reversal of resistance and so they would need to rely on the use of new agents active against multi-resistant clones. Objectives: The abilities of azithromycin and clarithromycin to promote carriage of macrolide resistant oral streptococci and the temporal persistence of the selected resistant commensals in healthy volunteers was investigated. Methods: Volunteers (n = 204) included were adult with no sign of respiratory tract infection and had not been administered any antibiotic in the past 3 months. Throat samples were taken before antibiotic administration (d1) and the volunteers randomly allocated into four groups to receive azithromycin or placebo once daily for 3 days, or clarithromycin or placebo twice daily for seven days. Further samplings were done on the 8th day after commencing the antibiotic/placebo course (d2), on the 14th day (w1), 28th day (w3), 49th day (w6), and finally in the 6th month (m6). Quantitation of the aerobic streptococcal flora was done on streptococcal agar with and without erythromycin (2 lg/ml) using a spiral plater (Eddy Jet, The Netherlands), and the percentage of macrolide-resistant streptococci determined by colony counting. Mean resistance proportions were compared between both macrolides and their respective placebo groups as well as between the two macrolide groups. For this, Student's t-test and an analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post-hoc test were used. Results: Comparative impact of the two macrolide regimens on the prevalence of macrolide resistant streptococci over a period of 6 months is presented in the graph. The mean resistance proportions at each time point following azithromycin or clarithromycin use when compared to their respective placebos, showed a significant increase (p \u00a3 0.01 overall) in macrolide-resistant streptococci that persisted for >6 months. Comparing the two macrolides, differences in mean macrolide resistance were not significant immediately following azithromycin and clarithromycin use (p = 0.8), decreased significantly faster in the clarithromycin group than the azithromycin group in w1 and w3 (p \u00a3 0.001), and became non-significant in w6 and m6 (p = 0.07 and 0.6, respectively).",

Salmonella is naturally susceptible to nitrofurans, an agent authorised in EU until 90's for food animal production. In Portugal, during the last years, a widely illegal use of nitrofurans was detected, affecting several types of husbandries, especially poultry ones. In this study we evaluated the susceptibility to nitrofurantoin of 1183 Salmonella isolates (clinical humans, poultry products, other foods and environment), in order to assess the contribution of nitrofurans illegal use in the selection and persistence of Salmonella. Methods: The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by the agar dilution method. The presence and genetic content of class 1 integrons were investigated by PCR and sequencing. Clonality was searched by PFGE following XbaI digestion. Results: Decreased susceptibility to nitrofurantoin (MIC \u2021 64 mg/L) was the most common amongst our isolates (n = 767/1183; 65%), although resistance to other antimicrobial agents was also observed. A different resistance rate to nitrofurantoin was observed in isolates from poultry (n = 62/84; 74%) and clinical humans (n = 618/870; 71%) comparing to those from other food products (n = 76/173; 44%) and environment (n = 11/56; 20%). Decreased susceptibility to nitrofurantoin was most common in isolates from serogroup D, mainly S. Enteritidis of different phagetypes (85% of poultry and 89% of human isolates). It is of note that multiresistant isolates from serogroup B of clinical and food sources also presented decreased susceptibility to nitrofurantoin: S. Typhimurium clone carrying an 2000-bp integron with blaOXA-30 -aadA1 and S. Typhimurium DT104 clone carrying 1000 (aadA2) and 1200 bp (blaPSE-1) class 1 integrons. Conclusion: This study points out for another perspective related with antibiotic usage in food animal production: the contribution of one antimicrobial agent on the emergence of a particular bacteria implicated in human infections. In Portugal, the widespread use of nitrofurans especially in the poultry industry may have contributed to the prevalence of S. Enteritidis in chickens and consequently in human infection. It is tempting to speculate that the use of nitrofurans may also have been implicated in the selection and persistence of the two multiresistant national widespread S. Typhimurium clones.",

Use of quinolone more than once within the last year, living in rural area, having urinary catheter, age > 50, complicated infections were included to the model as variables, and logistic regression was performed. Results: A total number of 537 isolates from 537 patients with community acquired urinary infections were studied. Eightyfive per cent of the patients were female, the median age was 49 years (19-70). Ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in 33% of the patients. Extended spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) was detected in 9% of the strains. Living in rural area (p = 0.039), having urinary catheter (p < 0.001), complicated infections (including male gender, urological operation, etc), age > 50 (p = 0.002), quinolone use in last 3 months (p = 0.002), receiving quinolone more than once within a year (p < 0.001) were found to be statistically significant. Use of antibiotic regimen other than quinolone was not associated with ciprofloxacin resistance (p = 0.222). The Marmara region had the lowest rate of cipro resistance (23%), although it was not significant (p = 0.230). In multivariate analysis, use of quinolone more than once within the last year (OR, 2.7; CI,1.4-5.2; p = 0.003), age > 50 (OR, 1.6; CI, 1.06-2.4; p = 0.023), having urinary catheter (OR, 5; CI, 1.6-16.7; p = 0.007), and complicated infections (OR, 2; CI, 1.3-3.1; p = 0.001) were found to be the risk factors of ciprofloxacin resistance. Emergence of ESBL was found to be associated with quinolone use (p = 0.008). Conclusion: The high rate (33%) of ciprofloxacin resistance among urinary E.coli isolates is an emerging problem. Quinolone use, older age, urinary catheters and complicated infections are important predisposing factors.

Methods: All episodes of community-acquired bacteraemia (according to CDC criteria) due to ESBLEC from January 2001 to October 2004 in our 950-bed hospital were included. ESBL production and antimicrobial susceptibility were studied by microdilution (NCCLS guidelines). ESBL were characterized by isoelectric focusing, PCR, and sequencing. Clonal relationships among the isolates were determined by Rep-PCR. Two control groups (2:1 in each group) were chosen: (A) randomly selected episodes of community-acquired episodes of bacteraemia due to non-ESBLEC, and (B) randomly selected patients admitted from the emergency department. Univariate and multivariate analysis (logistic regression) were performed. Results: Sixteen cases were included. The features of the patients were: median age, 71 years (range, 28-89); 62% were male; 81% had some contact with health-care during last year; 44% had a structural disease of the urinary tract; 56% had received antimicrobials during the last 2 months (fluorquinolones the most frequent, 31%); the origin of the bacteraemia was the urinary tract in 56%, an intraabdominal infection in 31% and unknown in 13%; 25% presented with severe sepsis or septic shock; related mortality was 6% and crude mortality 13%. All isolates were susceptible to meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin, 58% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and 25% to ciprofloxacin. By Rep-PCR, the 12 isolates studied to date were clonally unrelated. The most frequent ESBL produced was CTX-M-14 (75% of the 12 studied isolates). Independent risk factors associated with ESBLEC bacteraemia were (multivariate analysis): for control group A, previous antimicrobial use (OR = 8. Objectives: Despite the increasing prevalence of antimicrobialresistant pathogens (AMR-P) and the ongoing controversy about the most effective control strategies, surprisingly few studies attempted to quantify the mortality burden of AMR-P in Europe. In the belief that accurate data on the clinical impact of AMR-P are necessary to allow informed policy-decisions, we performed an exploratory ecologic analysis of the crude excess mortality associated with inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock due to AMR-P in European ICUs. Methods: Based on a comprehensive review of the published literature, we examined population-based data from several large cohort studies and clinical trials of critically ill patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. We constructed a conceptual model of a hypothetical cohort of an average European ICU (1000 admissions/year) to determine the number of premature excess deaths associated with AMR-P and to extrapolate the overall mortality burden. The model was reviewed by a 4-member expert panel consisting of 1 critical care specialist, 1 epidemiologist and 2 infectious disease specialists with extensive research experience in severe sepsis and AMR-P. Results: The conceptual model is shown in the Figure. Our review indicated that the average excess fraction of AMR-P-related deaths was 24 fatal cases per 1000 cases of severe sepsis, corresponding to an average of 3 excess deaths per 1000 ICU-admissions. The AMR-P-related mortality burden varied greatly across European countries with more than 1000 excess ICU-deaths in Germany and France and less than 100 ICUdeaths in Denmark, Finland and Norway. The estimated total number of AMR-P-related excess deaths in 15 European countries was at least 5800.",

Nevertheless, our results are likely to be conservative estimates and may allow further research to assess the cost-benefit of AMR-P control. Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 bacterial infections treated by physicians in the developed world have been shown to be caused by bacteria growing in biofilms, and all device-related infections belong to this category. Biofilm infections are generally characterized by a slow onset, by lowgrade symptoms, and by their chonicity and their refractory response to antibiotic therapy. This inherent resistance to antibacterial agents, and to host defenses, has been demonstrated in vitro and its mechanism(s)has been elucidated to some extent. The extracellular matrix protects biofilm cells from antibodies and from phagocytes, and these sessile cells adopt a special phenotype that differs profoundly from that of planktonic cells, and mediates high levels of resistance to antibiotics and sterilants. Now that many of the salient characteristics of chronic bacterial infections have been attributed to the fact that the causative organisms live in biofilms, we can understand the etiology of dozens of infections ranging from otitis media to infections of native and mechanical heart valves. Bacteria colonize an inert or a tissue surface, they develop into biofilms, resist clearance by host or therapeutic factors, and damage surrounding tissues by stimulating inflammatory responses. Now that the central problem of chronic infection is perceived to be biofilm persistence, several methods of biofilm control can be ''borrowed'' from nature and from engineering strategies. Many sessile plants and animals protect themselves from being buried in biofilms, by producing chemical blockers of biofilm formation, and these agents are now being used to control biofilms in industry. Engineers have discovered that biofilm bacteria can be killed by conventional antibiotics, if the structure of these sessile communities is disturbed by ultrasonic energy or by D.C. electric fields. We will describe instances in which these novel biofilm control measures are being used in medical and dental contexts.",

The aim of our studies was to establish the importance of this resistance mechanism for the resistance of biofilms to beta-lactam antibiotics. The AmpC expression in P. aeruginosa biofilms was studied in ceftazidime or imipenem treated biofilms (sub-MIC concentrations) of PAO1 with a reporter fusion of the ampC promoter to gfp (ASV) encoding an unstable version of green fluorescent protein. The effect of high-level expression of chromosomally encoded AmpC beta-lactamase on the survival of bacteria in a ceftazidime treated biofilm (10 times MIC) was studied in biofilms of Tn7gfp tagged clinical isolate stable derepressed for the production of AmpC due to an insertion sequence in the regulatory gene ampD and in the complemented strain expressing low basal level of beta-lactamase. The sub-MIC levels of ceftazidime and imipenem induced the monitor system, though imipenem was a better inducer. Sub-MIC levels of imipenem induced the monitor system in the periphery of the microcolonies while the centre remained uninduced, although the bacteria in the centre were physiologically active. The stablederepressed expression of AmpC beta-lactamase played a protective role during the treatment with 10 times MIC ceftazidime. These results show that in biofilms, besides tolerance of P. aeruginosa to beta-lactam antibiotics due to low-growth rate, oxygen and nutrient deprivation, classical resistance mechanisms, like high-level expression of AmpC beta-lactamase have an important role for the therapeutic failure of biofilm eradication in the cystic fibrosis lung.",

            "text": "The role of biofilm in staphylococcal diseases was revealed by the emergence of S. epidermidis clinical isolates producing an extracellular polysaccharide matrix and responsible for medical device infections and nosocomial bacteraemia. This discovery assessed that hospital conditions could transform non-virulent organisms into significant pathogens. In the following decades, numerous studies aimed to correlate qualitative or quantitative in vitro biofilm production with bacterial virulence in coagulasenegative staphylococci (CNS). Thus, biofilm production was considered as the major or sole factor of CNS virulence. Characterization of a major polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) component of staphylococcal biofilm and identification of the icaABDC operon opened the way to molecular studies of biofilm production in staphylococci. The prevalence of a highly conserved icaABDC operon in both S. aureus and S. epidermidis or some other CNS species represents a challenging observation that should be interpreted with caution in view of the significant differences in PIA expression by S. aureus versus CNS isolates. First, the extent of biofilm formation and its environmental regulation in vitro show significant differences between S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Second, S. aureus exhibits a much wider spectrum of virulence factors than S. epidermidis, which contribute to its multiple, alternative modes of virulence and persistence in human and animal hosts. Further work is needed to more precisely define the involvement of biofilm formation in the various categories of S. aureus diseases or colonization in humans. The oxazolidinones represent the only unique class of antimicrobials developed in the past 20 years. Originally synthesized as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, molecular manipulation has resulted in compounds with acceptable toxic : therapeutic ratios and outstanding activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens. Linezolid is the first of these compounds to be successfully developed for clinical use. The oxazolidinones have a unique mechanism of action, inhibiting the formation of the initiation complex in ribosomal protein synthesis. Resistance develops via mutations in the 23S rRNA gene. Since most of the important gram-positive pathogens have multiple copies of this gene and it requires more than a single mutation to develop clinical resistance, bacteria have been slow to develop immunity to these compounds. The oxazolidinones also exhibit excellent bioavailability and outstanding tissue penetration. They show little or no interaction with the cytochrome P450 system and they have been shown to be clinically effective. Nonetheless, the currently available oxazolidinone, linezolid, does have certain disadvantages. The MICs are near the breakpoints for many susceptible organisms (and above for H. influenzae and M. pneumoniae). The drug is bacteriostatic or only slowly bactericidal and failures in endocarditis have been reported. Although toxicity has not been an issue in standard courses of therapy, myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and optic neuritis have been seen in patients receiving the drug for long periods of time. This has proven to be a disadvantage in its application for infections such as Nocardia and tuberculosis (both organisms of which are susceptible to linezolid) because of the long duration of therapy involved. It has outstanding penetration in the CSF, but formal studies evaluating it in meningitis have not been performed. Because of its relatively short half-life, it must be given twice a day. A number of new oxazolidinones are being developed in an attempt to improve on the valuable properties of linezolid. Although none of these has yet reached the clinic, they will receive further discussion.",

They are however less-than-ideal-antibiotics, being only slowly bactericidal. Moreover, vancomycin is inferior to beta-lactams against infections due to methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and vancomycin resistance has emerged in enterococci and -rarelystaphylococci; teicoplanin resistance is common in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and occurs in enterococci with VanA. Three new glycopeptides now in Phase III: dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin. Dalbavancin resembles teicoplanin in microbiological activity but is more active against CoNS. Its unique feature us a serum t1/2 of c. 10 days, allowing once-weekly regimens and facilitating outpatient therapy or early discharge. By contrast, telavancin and oritavancin break the microbiological mould of earlier glycopeptides, being rapidly bactericidal and retaining activity against all vancomycin-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains. These differences reflect a secondary mode of action, probably involving membrane disorganisation. Daptomycin, the first lipopeptide antibiotic licensed, resembles glycopeptides in spectrum but has a unique mechanism, disrupting membrane potential and causing cell leakage. It is rapidly bactericidal and is unaffected by established resistance mechanisms; nevertheless there are a few reports of resistance emerging during therapy. The coming challenge is determining how best to deploy these compounds in relation to earlier glycopeptides and to other new anti-grampositive options. Is the rapid bactericidal activity of telavancin, oritavancin and daptomycin a major advantage in endocarditis, in immuno-compromised patients or even in surgical prophylaxis vs. MRSA? Will multiple modes of action of guard against rapid accumulation of resistance? Will any impact be made on the prevalence of MRSA infections?",

Deformylation is a crucial step in bacterial protein biosynthesis and is essential for bacterial growth [2] . At least one PDF gene has been found in all eubacterial genomes sequenced to date [3] . Peptide deformylase inhibitors (PDFI) appear to be one of the most exciting classes of antibacterial agents discovered to date. Rapid progress in the development of PDFI has been possible because (i) PDF is a metalloprotease, and this class of enzymes shows a high degree of structure-function conservation and (ii) the most potent PDFI are hydroxamate derivatives, a well known category of pharmacophores. The current challenge in structure activity relationship analysis is obtaining molecules with potent antibacterial activity in vivo against a range of drug resistant pathogens [4] . The PDFI now in clinical trials target community based bacterial infections, corresponding to a major pharmaceutical market [5] . Nevertheless, a transcribed gene encoding a homolog of bacterial PDF has been identified in the human genome [6] ; the encoded enzyme was shown to be active as a PDF in vitro, located in the mitochondria and one of the two components of mitochondrial NME [7] [8] [9] . Although further studies are required to determine the precise function of human mitochondrial NME, PDF activity appears to be crucial for human cells growth [10] . In this context, the precautionary principle imposes a new schedule of conditions for the design of new PDFI that will take into account the absence of inhibition of human PDF. As PDF inhibitors seem to have only very low levels of toxicity in human cells, PDF is however truly an exciting new target for the design of novel antibiotics.",

From these studies, it could be predicted that large-scale and prolonged anti-TNF treatment in humans would lead to infectious complications. Indeed, such complications (especially mycobacterial infections) are being encountered. The occurrence of these infections has implications for pretreatment assessment of patients, and guidelines are now appearing. The risk for opportunistic infections seems to be greater with monoclonal antibodies against TNF than with the TNF receptor construct. From a theoretical point of view one would assume differences between the types of anti-TNF drugs, as they differ in their capacity to interact with TNF-alpha and TNF-beta (lymphotoxin), and with membrane-bound TNF. As stated, it is not entirely clear how inhibition of TNF impairs host defence. Secondary inhibition of interferon-gamma may play a role, but more investigations are clearly needed.",

            "text": "Invasive fungal infections remain an unsolved misery in neutropenic cancer patients. It has long been accustomed to apply empirical amphotericin B or its lipid derivatives to those who did not respond to broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy and in whom no clues of infection apart from fever are present. However, such a practice is far from being ideal for decreasing mortality and morbidity due to disseminated fungal infections, since by this approach many patients are exposed unnecessarily to toxic and expensive drugs for an undetermined period of time. Recently, new improvements have significantly changed this picture. First, although conventional amphotericin B is still one of the most effective and broadest-spectrum antifungal agents, new less toxic and equally effective compounds have become available. Second, newer diagnostic tools tempted physicians to use these antifungal agents in a preemptive or targeted manner rather than empirical. The remaining piece in this puzzle is to develop a predictive model, as this has been a successful case for bacterial infections, in order to identify who will most benefit from empirical/preemptive antifungal treatment. Until then, the current approach to cancer patients with persistent fever must address antifungal treatment issues of effectiveness, safety and cost. The origin and dissemination of CA-MRSA is not clear but it seems that it was due to the independent acquisition of virulence traits (e.g. PVL gene) and resistant genes (e.g. SCCmec) by S. aureus lineages previously well adapted to the open community environment. This hypothesis explains the emergence of CA-MRSA in remote communities not exposed to the nosocomial milleu (e.g. Australia) and in countries where MRSA prevalence in hospitals is extremely low (e.g. Denmark). The SCCmec element carries the central element of methicillinresistance (the mecA gene), so that its aquisition defines the evolutionary step from methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) to MRSA. Moreover, since SCCmec also carries the genes responsible for its mobility (ccrAB locus) as well other acessory DNA sequences, it may be used as a marker for the origin and evolution of MRSA lineages. So far, four major SCCmec types have been described. HA-MRSA are mostly characterized by SCCmec types I-III, whereas CA-MRSA are mostly characterized by SCCmec type IV. Interestingly, SCCmec type IV seems to be the most mobile version since, besides being dominant among CA-MRSA, it is present among several HA-MRSA lineages and is also quite frequent among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. Perhaps as consequence of its enhanced mobility, SCCmec type IV is highly variable and several structural variants have been described, which makes its proper identification problematic and a challenge for any SCCmec typing scheme. Nevertheless, it is now clear that studies on the genetic organization(s) of SCCmec type IV strains are a key strategy for a better understanding of the origin and evolution of MRSA in general, and CA-MRSA, in particular. Some MLST-types suggest a wide dissemination of particular strains. This needs to be confirmed by further subtyping. Of special concern is the emergence of until now epidemic nosocomial MRSA which have acquired lukS-lukF and cause infections in the community. The reservoirs and ways of transmission of cMRSA in Europe are largely unknown. Candida species accounted for 97.5% of the fungal pathogens. Although C. albicans was the predominant species (64%) the proportion was lower than previously described (85% in 1994-5). However, the relative proportion varied considerably, i.e. from 57% at Hvidovre University Hospital to 72% at Herlev and Odense University Hospitals. C. glabrata was the second most frequently isolated fungus (over-all 20%) but again considerable variation in frequency was demonstrated (8-32%). C. krusei was rarely isolated (3%) and only detected at two of the six microbiology laboratories. Amphotericin B and Caspofungin MICs were in agreement with the typical patterns predicted by species identification, however, decreased azole susceptibility, defined as fluconazole MIC >8 and/or itraconazole MIC > 0.125 lg/ml was detected among 11 non-glabrata, nonkrusei Candida isolates (Table 1) .",

A recent study indicates that the positivity of PA test with P/T is likely due to a contamination of the drug with GM and not to a cross-reaction with the antibiotic (Mennink-Kersten et al. ICAAC 2004). So, while the origin of this contamination could be due to the use of Penicillium cultures for the production of P/T, it remains unclear why GM content differ substantially by batch and why some batches are negative. Our results show that not all P/T batches contain GM, and that the extent of contamination is highly variable. . Nine patients (41%) had definite IFIs, 6 (27%) sino-pulmonary infections (5 Aspergillus; 1 Scedosporium apiospermum) and 3 patients (14%) had disseminated disease (2 Fusarium and 1 Aspergillus fumigatus). In 13 patients (59%) with probable IFIs, 10 (45%) had fungal pneumonia and 3 (14%) with sino-pulmonary involvement. Twenty-one patients (95%) received HD-CAS in combination with another antifungal agent, 6 (27%) received HD-CAS upfront, whereas in 16 patients (72%) initial therapy included AmBisome, voriconazole, and conventional-dose CAS. The 12-week crude mortality was 41% and IFI-attributable deaths were 32%. Overall, HD-CAS was tolerated without serious adverse reactions; 2 patients (9%) developed fatal liver failure, which was deemed unrelated to HD-CAS.",

The commensal flora of the human intestine is a complex ecological system involved in host beneficial activities and disturbances of the microflora by antibiotic administration can lead to clinical implications. Exchange of resistance genes among the intestinal bacteria and bacteria passing through the colon might also be a serious threat to human health. Methods: Four healthy subjects receiving clindamycin for seven days and four non-treated subjects were included in the study. Faecal samples collected at nine different time points prior to and during a two-year period following the antibiotic treatment were cultured for Bacteroides spp. strains. Twenty representative colonies were collected and phenotyped and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to clindamycin, tetracycline and ampicillin according to NCCLS.

The trend showed a decline in species diversity, which did not return to pre-treatment levels for up to 18 months after administration. An increased frequency of resistance to clindamycin and tetracycline and a long-term enrichment of resistance genes (ermF and tetQ) among Bacteroides spp. were seen in exposed subjects. A broad baseline variation of clonal stability and antibiotic resistance between subjects were observed in both groups.

PAOdelta mutS::Km rifR mutants were recovered from the biofilm at a frequency of 1.00 \u00b1 0.88 \u00b7 10 )5 and from planktonic cultures at 3.54 \u00b1 1.66 \u00b7 10 )6 . Conculsion: P. aeruginosa may benefit from an increased mutation rate when confronted with the stressful situation of biofilm growth in the CF lung. The elevated MF of cells grown in the biofilm may give insight into the high occurrence of antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa leading to treatment failure in CF patients. Increased mutability in biofilms may enhance the opportunity to derive permanent hypermutators through mutation in DNA repair genes. MF observed in planktonic culture of PAOdelta mutS::Km was further elevated in the biofilm suggesting that in addition to mutS activity, expression of other mut genes may also influence mutability in the biofilm. Objectives: To date fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance has been described only anecdotally in Streptococcus pyogenes. Similar to other streptococci, efflux and/or mutations in the topoisomerase type II enzymes seem to account for fluoroquinolone resistance in this species. Mutations can arise spontaneously or be transferred by intraspecies or interspecies recombination. We analyzed an invasive ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC 8 mg/l) S. pyogenes isolate (emm-type 83) collected by the CDC's Active Bacterial Core surveillance programme to determine the mechanism through which it had become resistant. Methods: Efflux was tested for by comparing ciprofloxacin MICs in the presence and absence of reserpine (10 mg/l). The quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of gyrA and parC were sequenced. For parC, phylogeny was constructed by the Bayesian method. Recombination was statistically confirmed by using the maximum chi-squared test. Results: MICs were 8 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and 4 mg/l for levofloxacin. There was no evidence for an efflux pump. There was no mutation in gyrA and a S79F mutation was found in parC that is known to confer fluoroquinolone resistance. The parC nucleotide sequence of the isolate showed an increased diversity compared to the S. pyogenes reference strain, and there was a region of repeat nucleotide mismatches on both sides of the S79F mutation. Phylogenetic analysis of the parC sequence revealed homologies to the parC of S. dysgalactiae. Statistical analysis for recombination suggests interspecies recombination of at least 90bp sequence containing the S79F mutation with S. dysgalactiae. Conclusion: Interspecies recombination as cause of FQ resistance has to date not been described for S. pyogenes. We have found an invasive isolate with evidence for the acquisition of FQ resistance from S. dysgalactiae. Background: The M phenotype in macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes is mediated by an efflux transport system of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, in which mef(A) encodes the transmembrane domains, and msr(D) (previously called mat(A)) the ATP-binding domains. Both genes are carried on the Tn1207.3 element that integrates at a specific site, the comEC coding region, in the S. pyogenes chromosome. Methods: Two S. pyogenes (SP1 and SP2) isolated from wound and respiratory tract infections in Belgium were identified as macrolide-resistant and exhibited the M phenotype by the conventional disc-diffusion test. Primers consensus for mef(A)/ (E) were developed. RFLP analysis was done using BamH1, HindIII, and NheI followed by double-strand sequencing to distinguish mef(A) from mef(E). Moreover, primers to detect the left and right junctions of Tn1207.3 in comEC were used. A DNA microarray containing oligonucleotides designed to target each of the 58 Orfs of Tn1207.3 was used to detect presence of Tn1207.3. Emm types and clonality were investigated by reverse line blotting and PFGE, respectively. Results: The mef gene in SP1 and SP2 could be successfully detected by the consensus mef(A)/(E) primers. RFLP analysis proved inconclusive; a restriction pattern similar to mef(E) with BamH1 and HindIII, and one similar to mef(A) with NheI was observed for both isolates. Emm and PFGE typing found SP1 to belong to the emm4 serotype and SP2 to emm12 and both were clonally unrelated. Microarray analysis showed that only 19 out of 58 probes had reactivity with SP1 DNA. No reactivity was detected with SP2 DNA. DNA sequence analysis showed that the mef gene from SP1 and SP2 were different (91% homology at the nucleotide level), and were also different from the canonical mef(A) and mef(E) genes. Mef from SP1 showed 88% homology to mef(A) and 89% to mef(E). Mef from SP2 showed 90% homology to mef(A) and 95% to mef(E). In SP1, the Tn1207.3like element was integrated in comEC. Conclusions: We present here evidence of novel Tn1207.3-like genetic elements that carry allelic variants of mef in S. pyogenes. The complete sequence of these elements and their integration sites in S. pyogenes are currently under investigation. The strains were characterized for their susceptibility to antibiotics both at the phenotypic and genotypic levels; furthermore, the association of resistance genes and the mobile genetic elements that carry them was also evaluated. Methods: MICs of antibacterials were performed by following NCCLS guidelines. The presence of erm(B), erm(A), mef(A) and tet(M) genes, as well as the mobile elements carrying them was determined using previously published methods1, 2, 3. Results: The strains in this study were resistant to penicillin (MIC > 2 mg/l) in 19.2% of cases, resistant to tetracycline in 88.5%, to cotrimoxazole, cefuroxime and amoxicillin in 23.1% while only telithromycin retained 100% activity against all microorganisms. A total of 88.5% of isolates were co-resistant to all macrolides and to tetracycline, 23% were co-resistant to all macrolides, to tetracycline and to cotrimoxazole and 19.2% to macrolides, to tetracycline and to penicillin. All isolates showing MLSB phenotype of resistance possessed the erm(B) genes and in 71.9% of cases this gene was associated with tet(M). In these strains the resistance determinants were carried by the Tn-1545type element. Isolates showing the M phenotype generally possessed mef(A) genes alone, carried by Tn-1207.1 and only in one isolate the class mef(A) was associated with tet(M) and carried by Tn-2009. Although genotypically diverse, strains included in the study carried erm(B) associated with tet(M) in the same ApaI fragment of different sizes. Conclusion: Telithromycin is highly active against multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae carrying many genes responsible for resistance to different classes of antibiotics. Our study shows that erm(B) is the most frequent gene responsible for macrolide-resistance found in S. pneumoniae and this was always associated with tet(M) on the same Tn-1545-like element, while the association between mef(A) and tet(M) is carried by Tn-2009. Methods: Chlamydial strains were grown in LLC-KM2 cells and EBs purified by sucrose gradients. The cathelicidin peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method using Fmoc chemistry. After purification by reversed-phase HPLC the peptides were lyophilized and stored at 4\u00b0C. Peptides were twofold diluted in test tubes containing PBS and a total volume of 0.15 ml of a suspension of purified EBs in SPG medium was added to the tube. The suspensions were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours and inoculated onto LLC-MK2 cells. After incubation cell cultures were fixed and stained with fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody reactive with the chlamydial specific genus antigen. Results: A different sensitivity of chlamydiae to cathelicidin peptides was observed. C. trachomatis was the most sensitive of chlamydiae and SMAP-29 was the most active peptide. The treatment of C. trachomatis EBs with SMAP-29 reduced by over 50% the inclusion number of all the 10 strains tested, at a concentration of 10 lg/ml. BMAP-27, BMAP-28 and Bac7 displayed a similar activity at a concentration of 80 lg/ml. In contrast, LL-37 did not exert any inhibitory activity and PG-1 was only active against serotypes D,H and LGV2. C. pneumoniae strains ( n\u00b0tested = 5) were sensitive only to SMAP-29 at a concentration of 10 lg/ml. Chlamydia strains of animal origin ( n\u00b0tested = 10) were not susceptible to cathelicidins, with the exception of four strains of C. felis. Electron microscopy analysis of C. pneumoniae EBs treated with SMAP-29 showed striking morphological changes of EBs with the loss of their integrity, the appearance of amorphous and membranous material and empty vescicles. Conclusions: Previous studies and the present one suggest that cathelicidin peptides have substantial in vitro activity against several microorganisms. Much remains to be done to evaluate their in vivo efficacy and safety, in particular with respect to their interaction with constituents of biological fluids. Therefore, studies in animal models of chlamydial infection are needed to prove whether they will parallel in vitro results. The growing number of antibiotic-resistant microbial strains and the appearance of new human pathogens require the development of novel antibiotics with different mechanism of action. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are very promising candidates in this direction, as they kill target microbes rapidly, have broad activity spectra that can cover bacteria, fungi and some enveloped viruses, including the more serious antibioticresistant pathogens, while it is relatively difficult to select resistance against them in vitro. AMPs are an important component of the innate immune system, an ancient form of host defence, which is shared by effectively all multicellular organisms and provides a rapid first line of antimicrobial host defence. Objectives: To determine the mechanisms of natural selection underlying variations in one of these peptides, the amphipathic, alpha-helical cathelicidin-derived LL-37 and its variants in numerous primates and to relate these variations to functional properties. Methods: We have cloned, sequenced and investigated the evolutionary relationship of the genes for 22 LL-37 primate variants. Selected peptides have been synthesised using optimised solid phase peptide synthesis. We have then analysed and compared the capacity of the peptides to assume a helical structure in different salt and membrane mimicking conditions by circular dichroism spectroscopy. This structural data has then been correlated to biological activity in vitro. Results: The tested peptides showed broad but differing medium-and salt-sensitive spectra of activity against Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi. Killing kinetics and membrane permeabilisation kinetics of reference Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria indicated that the mode of action may vary in a manner dependent on both structure and charge. Unlike other AMPs that act selectively on bacterial cells, LL-37 and its variants also exhibit structure dependent cytotoxic effects against mammalian cells. Conclusion: The results suggest that the evolution of these peptides works to vary the charge, while conserving the amphipathic structure in a manner that markedly affects the capacity to aggregate under physiological conditions. This process appears to be subjected to positive selection, possibly caused by direct interaction of the peptides with specific pathogens or biotas, although the added role of the immune functions, such as signalling and chemotaxis, remains to be determined. Objectives: Characterization of the expanded-spectrum betalactamase resistance determinant of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate recovered from a rectal swab of a patient hospitalized at the Bic\u00eatre hospital, K.-Bic\u00eatre (France) in March 2004. This strain was resistant to most beta-lactams except to imipenem. Methods: Double disk synergy test performed with clavulanic acid-containing disks was used for detection of the extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL). PCR experiments and cloning were used for identification of the corresponding gene. Results: A blaGES-like gene was identified by PCR that was cloned in Escherichia coli. The beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of E. coli DH10B harboring recombinant plasmid (pDEJ/GES) showed resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins and aztreonam. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a novel GES variant, GES-5, that had a single amino acid change as compared to ESBL GES-1, differing by a Gly to Ser substitution in position Ambler 242. Kinetic measurements revealed that GES-5 hydrolyzed penicillins and cephalosporins at a higher level than GES-1. In addition, GES-5 hydrolyzed aztreonam at a higher level than the other GES-type enzymes. GES-5 activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid and tazobactam but also by imipenem. The blaGES-5 gene was located in a class 1 integron together with an aacA4 gene cassette, both cassettes being separated by an ISPa21 insertion sequence element. PCR and NASBA were applied to respiratory specimens. An expanded gold standard was used to calculate the sensitivities and specificities of all tests: 1) positive by PCR and NASBA or 2) positive by 1 amplification test and at least one serological test (either IgM or a seroconversion or significant rise of IgG antibodies), or 3) a seroconversion or a significant rise of IgG antibodies in at least two different EIA's. Results: 39 patients met the criteria of the expanded gold standard. The sensitivities of the EIA's ranged from 10%-31% for IgM in the acute phase serum and from 19%-42% for IgM in the convalescent serum. IgG seroconversion or a significant rise in titre ranged from 41%-68%. Higher sensitivities were obtained for PCR and NASBA: 82% and 72%, respectively. The specificities ranged from 81%-99% for IgM in the acute phase serum, from 82%-99.5% for IgM in the convalescent phase serum, and from 95%-99% for IgG. The calculated specificities of PCR and NASBA were 98% and 97%, respectively. The MP IgM assay with the best combined values for sensitivity and specificity was the AniLabsystems EIA. The best MP IgG assay was the Medac EIA. MP PCR and NASBA positive patients had usually higher rises in IgG titre than MP PCR and NASBA negative patients. False positive IgM results occurred most frequently with the Immunowell assay. Conclusion: Evaluation of the 4 EIA's and 2 independent amplification tests for MP showed substantial differences between the performances of the assays. Amplification methods are the most sensitive tests to diagnose an acute MP infection. IgM antibodies are of limited value. IgG serology has usually a moderate sensitivity but results in late diagnosis.",

Lim et al recently developed CURB65, which divides patients into 3 groups based on 5 prognostic indicators. There is evidence that hospital medical staff, however, have sub-optimal knowledge about assessing severity in CAP. Potentially this could be improved by using a generic rather than the disease specific tools currently used in acute medicine. This study assessed the performance of two generic tools, the Scottish Early Warning System (SEWS) and the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), with CURB65 in CAP. Methods: As part of a quality improvement programme, data were collected prospectively over two winters (November-April 2001 and 2002). Prognostic indicators were recorded at admission and a severity score assigned for each of the tools. Mortality was assessed at 30 days. For each tool, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value were calculated and a receiver-operating curve (ROC) produced. Results: Full prognostic data were available on 435 (CURB65), 426 (SEWS) and 439 (SIRS) patients. 30-day mortality for CURB65 scores of 0-1 (home therapy), 2 (non-severe, but manage in hospital) and 3 or more (severe) was 2%, 16% and 35%. Mortality for SEWS scores of 0-1 (routine observations), 2-3 (hourly observations) and 4 or more (doctor review within 30 mins.) was 9%, 17% and 27%. Mortality for patients with 0-4 SIRS criteria was 0 = 13%, 1 = 20%, 2 = 20%, 3 = 21% and 4 = 6%. Adding a severe sepsis stratification to the SIRS criteria was not useful as some patients without sepsis (SIRS 0-1) appear to have organ dysfunction/hypoperfusion; these patients have high mortality. Sensitivity and specificity for severe versus non-severe illness (defined as a CURB65 score of 3 or more, a SEWS score of 4 or more and two or more SIRS criteria) for each of the rules were 71% and 70% (CURB65), 52% and 67% (SEWS), and 74% and 31% (SIRS).

Objectives: To investigate the epidemiology, molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics of invasive Group A Streptococcal (GAS) disease, and to compare invasive and noninvasive isolates. Methods: Invasive GAS isolates were sent to SMI from the Swedish microbiological laboratories between April 2002 and December 2004. Also, during 18 months 10 non-invasive isolates were collected each month at 6 of the laboratories. Questionnaires for clinical and epidemiological data were sent to the responsible MD for each patient with invasive disease. All isolates were characterized with respect to T-type, emmsequence type, gene detection for 9 superantigens and antibiotic susceptibility. The clonal relationship within subgroups of isolates was investigated with PFGE and MLST. Results and Conclusions: Until November 2004 we received 675 invasive isolates and 548 (81%) returned questionnaires. So far 70% of the patients had underlying chronic diseases, predisposing factors or drug abuse. 60% of patients were reported to have skin as site of entry of infection, 16% the respiratory tract, and 7% had a puerperal or genital infection. 12% of patients had no identified focus. Further, 13% of patients developed streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and 40% of these patients died. The over all mortality was 14%. When looking at the outcome of STSS patients receiving IVIG as compared to those who did not, a significant difference was seen in survival in favour of the treatment (p = 0.0122), which is in agreement with our previous studies. The most common T-type in Sweden during this period was the T3/13/B3264 cluster that accounted for about 34% of invasive isolates and 20% of controls (isolated from patients with skin-or throat infections). Resistance to MLS antibiotics was rare (0.2%) whereas a high rate of tetracycline resistance (33%) was observed. Acknowledgement: The study was supported by the European Commission.",

Recent outbreaks of hepatitis A were observed worldwide, with special attention on homosexual men, but also illicit drug users. Even 113 p of 132 (85.6%) were represented by male adults aged 22-44 years, who recognized unprotected homo-bisexuals contacts in the 2 months preceding the onset of hepatitis A in 89 cases (78.8%). Nobody reported contacts with p with a recently diagnosed hepatitis A and nobody underwent specific anti-HAV vaccination. Among the 113 adult males with HAV, concurrent STD were seen in 35 p (p < 0.004) including chronic hepatitis B in 6 cases, hepatitis C in 14, syphilis in 7 and HIV in 12 patients. Discussion: Despite the availability of anti-HAV vaccination and information campaigns aimed against the spread of HIV and STD in general, the continued spread of hepatitis A clearly recognize an increased prevalence of homo-bisexual transmission. Our experience shows a strict link between novel diagnoses of acute HAV infection and homo-bisexual behavior which remained unchanged in proportion since 1999, but showed a significant increase of absolute number of detected cases from late 2002 until now. A careful report and monitoring, specifical educational campaigns, and enforced public health measures (such as recommendation of anti-HAV immunoprophylaxis for p at risk), are expected to contain the rising outbreak of hepatitis A among homo-bisexual men in our community and concurrently stop the spread of other common and potentially severe STD such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis. Objectives: A prospective nationwide candidemia study has been ongoing in Norway since 1991. Population-based surveillance studies makes comparisons of incidence and species distribution in various age groups possible. This report provides a description of the epidemiological characteristics of candidemia in the elderly. Methods: Yeast blood culture isolates in all microbiological laboratories in Norway (population 4.5 mill) have been recorded prospectively. Isolates have been sent to the national mycology reference laboratory for identification and susceptibility testing. Results: For the period 1991-2003 a total of 1400 candidemia episodes were diagnosed in Norway. The total number of yeast strains recovered were 1421 (21 patients with 2 species). The overall candidemia incidence was 2.5 per 100000 inhabitants. The annual incidence in patients aged \u202180 years is especially high and has increased markedly the last 3 years compared to patients in younger age groups ( Table 1 ). The species distribution is also different in the old age group. The percentage of C. glabrata isolates was 5% the age group <50 years, 13% in patients aged 50-79 years and 31% in patients \u202180 years. ",

Laboratory values do not differ from those already known to be acute phase reactants, such as elevated WBC and a low albumin level. Intra-hospital mortality is significantly higher in nonagenarians presenting with an infectious condition. Objectives: Bacteremia and invasive disease with zoonotic nontyphoid Salmonella spp. are well known to occur in subjects with co-morbidity. Especially, aortitis and endocarditis are described in patients with arteriosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. However, the incidence of these complications and the agedependency are not well established. Results: A total of 109 patients with nontyphoid Salmonella bacteraemia was identified, and 77 of these were > 50 years old. In this age group, seven patients (9%) had an intravascular Salmonella focus, five with mycotic aorta aneurysm, and two patients had endocarditis. We detected S. enteritidis in 3 cases, S. typhimurium in 2 cases, S. dublin in 1 case and S. sandiego in 1 case, which is not different from the overall bacteraemia species distribution. As North Jutland County had a 10-year cumulated population of 1,665,094 subjects >50 years, the populationincidence was 0.04/100,000 person-years. Mortality was 1 out of 7 within 30-days and 3 out of 7 within 180-days after detection of bacteraemia. Four patients were long-term survivors. Conclusions: In elderly patients >50 years a high percentage of zoonotic nontyphoid Salmonella bacteraemia cases has secondary intravascular focal infections, which requires special treatment. Clinical examinations for a secondary intravascular focus are recommended in this age group.",

Enhanced surveillance of GAS invasive disease commenced on 1 January 2003 for a two years period. Collected isolates were characterized by both serological T, OF and M typing and more advanced molecular methods e.g. emm-sequencing, PFGE and MLST. Strains were screened for antibiotic susceptibility and MIC was determined by E-test. For standardization of methods and detection of possible errors two sets of EQA strains for antibiotic susceptibility and one set for typing were sent to all centres. Data file specification for collection of patient and microbiological data was developed and each partner submitted their results to a central database in Finland. Results: By July 2004 over 5000 invasive GAS isolates were collected. The population based incidence for year 2003 varied between countries from 0.1 to 3.8 per 100,000 inh. The type distribution of GAS also varied markedly. In a few countries types 1, 3 and 28 were predominant; however, an overall increase of new invasive types was noticeable. A high level of MLS antibiotic resistance in some countries (France, Italy) and very frequent tetracycline resistance in almost all countries was noted. Conclusion: The Strep-EURO project created a European network for epidemiological analysis and surveillance of severe streptococcal disease in ten EU and one Associated Countries. We expected 1,000 cases/year to be found but after 18 mounts over 5,000 were reported. The overall increase of invasive cases partly depend on the role of Strep-EURO in establishment of a new surveillance system and development of an European network. Any defined conclusion has to wait until the data are carefully analysed. Report on increasing frequency of unusual emm types is a concern. There is also a need of studying the background of increasing tetracycline resistance despite lack of use of this drug for treatment of streptococcal diseases.

            "text": "Metallo-beta-lactamases: a last frontier for beta-lactams? Beta-lactams remain a cornerstone for antimicrobial chemotherapy of a large number of bacterial infections, but their efficacy has been increasingly thwarted by dissemination of acquired resistance determinants among pathogenic bacteria. Metallo-betalactamases (MBLs) are a family of beta-lactam-degrading enzymes present in some environmental species, that only recently have emerged as resistance determinants of notable clinical importance. Their overall impact is still lower than that of serine-beta-lactamases, but during the last decade at least 4 different types of MBLs (IMP, VIM, SPM and GIM), encoded by genes associated to mobile DNA, have been recruited from unknown genomes into major gram-negative pathogens, including members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and other nonfastidious gramnegative nonfermenters. These acquired MBLs, of which some are already distributed on a worldwide scale, represent a formidable challenge to antimicrobial chemotherapy due to their extremely broad substrate specificity and mechanistic uniqueness: most beta-lactams (including carbapenems and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins) are efficiently degraded by these enzymes, while conventional beta-lactamase inactivators, such as clavulanate, sulbactam and tazobactam, are useless against them. MBLs exhibit a remarkable structural plasticity and it remains unclear whether they share a common reaction mechanism: this explains, at least in part, the difficulties encountered in finding broad-spectrum inhibitors and underlines the importance of comparative studies aimed at the identification of relevant molecular targets for inhibition. Several important issues concerning MBLs remain open: epidemiological distribution/ magnitude of the problem, laboratory diagnosis, clinical significance in different settings, spreading mechanisms, original sources and evolutionary history, structure-function relationships and catalytic mechanism. The scope of this presentation will be to discuss over recent advances on open issues, and how they are likely to contribute to combating resistance mediated by MBLs, which are now considered among the most worrysome emerging resistance determinants in gram-negative pathogens. Acknowledgements: The work on MBLs in our laboratory is supported by grants from the European Commission (HPRN-CT Social-political consequences of the HIV pandemic: are we turning the tide? The enormous size of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its devastating social and economic consequences have made it a geopolitical threat of prime importance to the world and placed it on the agenda of the UN Security Council and the General Assembly. According to the Millennium Goal further spread of HIV should be stopped by 2015. Is this a realistic goal? The odds to succeed within such a limited period of time do not seem favourable as we after 20 years still are in the beginning of the pandemic which is in a dynamic phase spreading to populous regions such as India, China and the former Soviet Union. The pandemic is continuing unabated with some five million new infections and three million fatal cases per year. Forty million are currently living with HIV/AIDS in the world and 30 million have already died. Another 45 million is predicted to be HIV infected within the next ten years. It is easy to be paralysed by the sheer numbers. However, mankind can mobilise immense resources once the awareness and political will are present. That has unfortunately not happened yet on a scale which is commensurate to the threat. It is true that more political leaders now are talking about AIDS than before and that considerably more funding has been made available but it is far from enough to make a difference. The fight against AIDS is hampered by many obstacles of social and cultural nature that is embedded in human behaviour. Sexually transmitted infections are notoriously difficult to control. Syphilis is still rampant in many parts of the world after 500 years and in spite of efficient and inexpensive treatment since long. The subordinated status of women, particularly in developing countries, is at the root of the difficulties to control the spread of HIV. The infidelity of husbands and their refusal to use condoms are putting married women at a particularly high risk. It will take long time to influence male attitudes and to change laws, e.g. to empowering women to inherit properties and to make independent decisions in order to be economically emancipated and to be able to say no to unwanted sex. The proportion of women among people newly infected is increasing each year; fifty per cent of all infected persons in the world are women, in Africa it is sixty percent. The nature of the causative agent makes the AIDS epidemic uniquely difficult to control. The retrovirus attacks and resides in the immune system and hides in cellular sanctuaries. It has an extreme ability to mutate to avoid immune control and to develop resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Furthermore, HIV is transmitted vertically. What can we do against this formidable enemy? The introduction of efficient antiretroviral treatment was a revolutionary achievement but will not stop the HIV epidemic. In 2004 about 35,000 new HIV infections occurred in Western Europe and 45,000 occurred in North America in spite of the wide use of antiretroviral treatment since many years. To which extent antiretroviral treatment will be made available in a sustained way in developing countries is still an open question. Hopefully, prevention and treatment will work hand in hand. A cure is not yet at sight. We do not know if it is possible to develop an effective vaccine but we keep hoping so. However, in spite of the long list of difficulties there are some progresses as in several East African countries; the most heralded is the example from Uganda with the decline of HIV prevalence in pregnant women from 30 to 5 per cent (!) through sustained behaviour change. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission is another success -where it has been introduced. Comparison of the structures of haemagglutinins representative of the four influenza clades suggests that aspects of haemag-glutinin stability and activation for membrane fusion may be involved in clade formation. The structural details on which this possibility is based will be described in relation to irreversible changes in structure that are known to be required for membrane fusion activity and that can result from thermal inactivation.",

            "text": "The role of pneumococcal factors in virulence and carriage T.J. Mitchell (Glasgow, UK) Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen of man, causing diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis. The mechanisms by which this organism causes disease are still unclear but certainly involve over-activation of inflammatory pathways. The organism produces a range of factors that may be involved in the pathogenesis of infection. These include a toxin (pneumolysin) as well as a range of surface proteins and enzymes. The polysaccharide capsule is essential for virulence of the organism. The availability of genome sequences of several strains of pneumococcus has allowed the identification of putative virulence factors and regulatory pathways. Use of this information in conjunction with in vitro systems and animal models allows the study of the role of these factors in disease. I will describe data we have on the role of surface proteins, the toxin pneumolysin and the heat shock protein HtrA in the virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pneumolysin is a major virulence factor of the organism and induces inflammation in the lung. Very small amounts of the toxin are able to induce inflammatory cytokine production. Surface proteins such as pneumococcal surface protien C (PspC) play a role in both attachment and interaction of the organism with the immune system. I will describe the use of genetically defined mutants of the pneumcooccus lacking PspC in animal models of infection. These studies show that the role of PspC in the disease process is different for different strains of the organism. HtrA is a heat shock protein of the pneumococcus and is probably acts as both a chaperone and protease to control protein folding and degrade misfolded proteins. We have shown that deletion of the gene for HtrA attenuates the pneumococcus in animal models of infection. This will allow us to investigate the possibility of using HtrA mutants as live vaccination vehicles. Several strains of the pneumococcus have have been subjected to total genome sequencing. Availability of these genome sequence allows the construction of microarrays and I will describe our use of these chips to study regulatory pathways in the pneumococcus. Analysis of gene expression in different serotypes of the pneumococcus suggests that there may be serotype specific regulatory pathways within the organism. This has implications for treatment and vaccination.",

            "text": "Impact of conjugate vaccine on the epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumoniae H. Peltola (Helsinki, FIN) Pneumococci cause various diseases of which non-bacteremic or bacteremic pneumonia, bacteraemia with unidentified focus, true sepsis, meningitis, other focal infections, and otitis media especially in small children are the most important manifestations. There is no doubt that a functioning vaccination would be of great individual and societal relevance. For 30 years, a 23valent vaccine has been available, but because of the inheritant problems of polysaccharide antigens, this product -as such good -left a room for a better immunogen. Hence, a 7-valent conjugate vaccine (7CV) was highly welcomed, when it arrived to the market a few years ago. The past few years have taught us the most important pros and cons of this vaccine. So far, data on the impact of 7CV have gathered only from vaccination of small children for whom a vaccine against acute otitis would be mostly welcomed. Unfortunately, more than one study has now showed that the effectiveness is, at most, meagre. A slightly better effect is observed in endpoints secondary to otitis (such as the need of tube insertion), but in this respect, children have not gained much of 7CV overall. Interestingly, the use of antimicrobials has sometimes declined by \u00b120% in settings where conjugate vaccine was used. On the other hand, replacement of the vaccine-type pneumococci by other serotypes in children's nasopharynx is documented. The clinical relevance of this finding is unsettled. The positive side of the coin is that 7CV indisputably prevents serious pneumococcal diseases, meningitis being the gravest manifestation. In developing countries, this information would be great newsshould they afford this extremely costly vaccine. In the industrialized world these entities are, however, very rare. A recent analysis of invasive pneumococcal infections in the largest pediatric hospital of Finland (85 cases during 13 years) showed only meningitis -1-2 cases a year -to be a meaningfully dangerous disease; all other manifestations were rather benign in which a short course of penicillin led to full recovery. Exceptions to this rule were rare. Because the cases were caused by 24 different serotypes, wide-scale use of 7CV would potentially have protected 57% of the cases, at maximum. Since the experience is similar in other industrialized countries, one has to put various demands in scales before 7CV is taken among the society-paid vaccines. For well-defined risk groups, and in private practice, 7CV should be readily available. The effect in the nasopharyngeal carriage of 7CV has brought a surprising benefit among elderly people in the USA among whom pneumococcal disease has declined by \u00b120%. This strong herd immunity effect is to be taken into account in future strategies. Since 7CV's high price is a critical issue, one has sought for a solution in reduction of vaccine doses. Australia has selected a 3-dose 7CV-schedule, and it is more than likely it will work. Another solution might be to trigger the T-cell response with 1-2 doses of 7CV, and to continue with polysaccharide vaccine. In theory, this approach would offer several major advantages. The first genome sequence for Chlamydia was released in 1997 and this information abruptly altered existing paradigms of chlamydial biology. The wealth of information inferred from the chlamydial genome sequence has had a large and broad impact on the chlamydial research arena. There are now complete genomes for more than six different chlamydial species/ biovariants and four genomes from different strains of C. pneumoniae. One of the conspicuous findings is that the three main phylogenetic groups, C. trachomatis, C. psittaci, and C. pneumoniae, have fundamentally identical gene content and gene order (synteny), although orthologous genes have low nucleotide identities. One point of reference is that genomes of different strains of Escherichia coli share only 40% of their gene content. The high level of genome identity for chlamydiae is even more remarkable in that these organisms cause diseases in numerous different host species and tissues. One can conclude that the high genome synteny reflects the paucity of acquisition of exogenous genes from other organisms and even a lack of within-organism recombination. Although these species have been separated for tens of millions of years and show their divergence by accumulation of point mutations, their biological relationships are extremely similar. All chlamydiae essentially share the same gene set, the same metabolic pathways, the same complex developmental cycle and the same mechanism for causing disease. Thus, time alone has not resulted in meaningful biological diversification at the genus level and this data is not consistent with proposals for a new genus separation for Chlamydia such as Chlamydophila. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular gram negative bacteria, with an unique bi-phasic life cycle, in which extracellular infectious elementary bodies (EB) of 300 nm in diameter alternate with the intracellular replicating form, the reticulate bodies (RB), of 1000 nm in diameter. The extracellular EB attach to the cell surface where it mediates its uptake in a phagosome. During the intracellular stage Chlamydia grow inside the phagosome, the chalmydial inclusion, within the host cell cytoplasm. EB transform to RB that divide for 24-48 hours where after they reorganize into EB. At the end of the cycle the host cell burst and EB are liberated and can infect new cells. During the intracellular phase the chlamydiae are surrounded by the inclusion membrane. Chlamydia have small genomes of 1.04 mega basses (Mb) for C. trachomatis and 1.23 Mb for C. pneumoniae, and a coding capacity of 875 and 1073 proteins, respectively. Such numbers of proteins are well separated by 2-dimentional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). Due to their bi-phasic life cycle we purified EB and RB from infected cells and in addition we purified the outer membrane complex of EB. These samples were separated by 2D-PAGE, and protein spots were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. These systematic proteome maps have given an understanding of the protein composition in the EB, RB and COMC, the metabolic possibilities of EB, and an understanding of components that may be localized at the chlamydial surface. Chlamydia have gene homologs for bacterial type II, III, and IV secretion systems and can therefore secrete proteins into the inclusion membrane and into the host cell cytoplasm. Type II and IV secreted proteins do have a leader sequence and type IV secreted proteins have characteristic structural motifs, but not-secreted proteins can also show these characteristics. Type III secreted proteins have no known motifs so the only way to identify such proteins is by identifying them in the host cell cytoplasm or in the chlamydial inclusion membrane. We have used a proteomics approach to identify secreted proteins, comparing the proteins from the cytoplasm, inclusion membrane plus the RB/EB and finally comparing that to the proteoms of RB/EB. This lead to identification of proteins secreted to the host cell cytoplasm by both type II and type IV secretion. Our proteomics work have lead to an understanding of both structural components of the microorganism and its interaction with its host cell.",

This epidemic is expected to grow further in coming years. The continuing increase is not explained by the introduction of nucleic acid amplification tests. Increasing levels of sexual risk taking behaviour are a more likely explanation. Pioneering studies in Sweden showed that chlamydia can lead to severe sequelae. In some countries huge resources are being devoted to the opportunistic detection and treatment to prevent salpingitis, ectopic pregnancy and infertility, despite a lack of evidence of its effectiveness. Annual screening in specific age groups has been widely recommended, but this has not been accomplished in any country. In Sweden free testing and treatment, and widespread testing among women were introduced in the1980s. Concurrent declines in rates of chlamydia-associated sequelae were widely interpreted as being due to opportunistic screening. However, recent analysis of a large Swedish cohort of women, followed for up to 15 years, indicates that the efficiency of chlamydia screening was low. In most years only 5-10% of 15-24 year old women were screened and half of all women screened were only ever tested once. This cohort study also showed that the risk of reproductive complications was lower than previously thought. Contact tracing can be used to detect chlamydia, especially in asymptomatic men not reached by opportunistic screening. However, its efficiency is suboptimal even in Sweden, where contact tracing is mandatory. Improved outcomes have been observed when home-sampling kits are offered to male partners of infected women, and by designating professional contact tracers in a central location for cases detected in primary care and non-specialized clinics. In 2003 lymphogranuloma venereum entered the European arena. Outbreaks amongst men having sex with men, many of whom are HIV positive, have been reported from the Netherlands and now several other countries. The appearance of this neglected chlamydial infection highlights the need for effective and integrated surveillance systems in Europe. To conclude, current chlamydia control activities have not controlled the spread of chlamydia. Large-scale randomised trials to determine the most effective approach to chlamydia screening in both men and women and to contact tracing are urgently required, and the risk of sequelae must be better determined.",

The two human pathogenic species are C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae, C. trachomatis is a leading cause of sexually transmitted bacterial infections with severe sequelae as tubal factor infertility and ectopic pregnancy and infections can be asymptomatic. So far no vaccine has been developed but studies that may lead to the development of a highly warranted vaccine have been performed. The first attempt to vaccinate children with a whole cell vaccine resulted in initially protection but the protection was short-lived. In animal models whole cell vaccination resulted in hypersensitivity reactions and therefore new strategies were developed. The most immunogenic molecule is the major outer membrane protein (MOMP) and therefore this molecule has been studied in great details as a vaccine candidate in animal models. Even though complete protection was not obtained reduced shedding was observed and vaccine trials using naked DNA as a vaccine resulted in stimulation of both the humoral and cellular immune response indicating progress in the vaccine development.MOMP varies, however, between serovars that are causing genital infections and therefore additional components may be needed. C. pneumoniae is causing respiratory tract infections and is associated to the development of coronary heart disease. Antibodies to conformational surface exposed epitopes are generated upon infections but MOMP is not the major immunogen. A large family of proteins, the polymorphic membrane proteins (Pmp) consisting of 21 members of which most are expressed were found to be localized in the C. pneumoniae outer membrane. As the Pmps are highly expressed in the outer membranes of C. pneumoniae we investigated whether they are recognized by a cell-mediated immune response. A mouse model for lung infections was developed. Following an experimental lung infection the spleen was removed and spleen cells were tested for production of interferon-gamma upon stimulation with C. pneumoniae elementary bodies (EB), recombinant MOMP and recombinant Pmps in an EliSpot assay. Using C. pneumoniae EB, recombinant MOMP and Pmp proteins as antigens it was found that EB elicited a strong interferon-gamma response in the EliSpot assay, MOMP did not respond but Pmp6,Pmp8, 20 and 21 were found to stimulate spleen cells to secrete interferon-gamma. The response was shown to be mediated by CD4+ T-cells. Pmp8 elicited the strongest response making it a good candidate for a subcomponent vaccine.",

The increasing concern regarding antifungal resistance among both common and uncommon fungal pathogens over the past 10-15 years further drives this burden of disease. Typically species such as Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus species exhibit different resistance phenotypes. The impact of resistance has only recently been fully appreciated with clinical failures due to both established and recently introduced agents being reported. As both acquired and intrinsic resistance continues to emerge it is recognized that a successful clinical outcome depends on several factors including the patient, selection of the appropriate agent, and the local epidemiology of the likely pathogen. Persistent drug pressure may result in acquired resistance in normally susceptible species or select for intrinsically resistant fungi from the patients endogenous flora or the extrinsic environment. In the hospital setting nosocomial transmission coupled with drug pressure may produce an endemic strain with progressively developing resistance. It is now apparent that the antifungal susceptibility profiles of Candida and Cryptococcus species may vary considerably from region-to-region or even among different hospital settings. Detection of specific DNA clades that are enriched for antifungal resistance phenotypes is a recent finding of great interest. Although new antifungal agents with novel mechanisms of action may temporarily improve our ability to treat certain fungal infections, the emergence of resistant fungi is inevitable and deserves our constant attention.",

            "text": "Whilst antifungal drug resistance has not proved to be as problematic as that experienced with antibacterial agents, both intrinsic and emergent resistance are encountered and antifungal susceptibility testing can help in the guidance of prescribing practices. The expanding armamentarium of antifungal agents dictates that the clinician has some guidance in selecting the most appropriate agent for a particular infection and relative susceptibility of the infecting organism is an important factor in the decision. There are many test parameters that can potentially impact on the susceptibility test result and in the early years of testing differences in test methods produced confusing and conflicting results. In recent years standardized methods for susceptibility testing of yeast and mould isolates have been introduced and for some drugs it has been possible to define breakpoints. Whilst there are still certain reservations over the test methods and their application to certain organism-drug combinations, their widespread adoption makes national and international comparisons of susceptibility trends possible. Intrinsic resistance, which is generally consistent and predictable, is encountered in an increasing number of yeast and mould species and highlights the need for accurate speciation of infecting organisms. Susceptibility testing is of great importance in detecting intrinsic resistance in a species and therefore establishing the spectrum of activity of new and developmental agents. There is the possibility that general use of an agent will lead to the development of emergent resistance in a previously susceptible organism. Currently there are few problems with emergent resistance during a course of treatment which is potentially a more serious scenario than the more predictable innate resistance. Far more likely to occur in yeast rather than mould infections, this has been encountered predominantly with flucytosine and fluconazole mainly as a consequence of inappropriate prescribing practices for specific infections in certain patient groups. It is therefore important that testing mechanisms are introduced with the capacity to identify potential problems as they occur.",

            "text": "Emerging enteric pathogens: responding to the challenge S392 Towards predicting cholera disease outbreaks within the Mediterranean Basin J.F. Gu\u00e9gan, G. Constantin de Magny (Montpellier, F) New insights into population dynamics of infectious diseases have shown the existence of regular cycles in the number of cases over time, with alternance of periods of booms and busts. The dynamics of infectious diseases is determined by a large number of complex processes acting over a large range of spatio-temporal scales. However, studies have been restricted so far to tiny hierarchical scales, which cannot really capture what may still happen at upper scales. Recent discoveries on both Vibrio cholerae life-cycle and cholera cases dynamics started to disentangle the many intrinsic and extrinsic environmental factors that may be involved in the evolution of disease within communities. Findings show that cholera cases may fluctuate with periods of outbreaks and quasi-extinction, depending on both local and large-scale environmental conditions, which influence V. cholerae kinetics within the environment. Based on statistical analysis and ecological modelling, we will show how we can model cholera cases dynamics within the Mediterranean area in taking account large-scale environmental conditions. Both studying the evolution of cholera cases in countries of northern Africa (using sophisticated wavelet analyses), and modelling the Vibrio lifecycle (using differential equations systems) based on environmental, ecological parameters obtained from remote-sensing and oceanographic surveys, we here present models that really mimic cholera disease patterns observed over time within the area. Results on cholera time-series in the southern part of the basin indicate that outbreaks are mainly associated with an elevation of local sea surface. The ecological modelling of outbreaks, which considers the many processes involved, shows that the existence of an environmental reservoir may help to explain cholera dynamics. This work constitutes one of the few studies on cholera dynamics which clearly show the influence of large-scale environmental factors on the evolution of cholera cases. More specifically, it is the first study which really demonstrates for the Mediterranean Sea that common processes to other regions of the World are at work in producing more or less periodic cholera outbreaks in the sub-southern region of the Basin. As climate temperature should increase in the future, the consequences on cholera outbreaks might be highly sensitive. Accordingly, this study is then the first step towards producing a predictive model of Vibrio bacteria emergence within the Mediterranean basin based on an integrated environmental surveillance. Objectives: It has recently been suggested that a first vaccination against influenza is less effective than revaccination among elderly persons (Voordouw B, et al. JAMA, 2004) . This might negatively influence first starters, especially persons with high-risk medical conditions younger than 65 years in whom vaccine uptake is considerably lower. We therefore aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness of influenza vaccination among first starters of any age in the Dutch influenza vaccination programme in preventing morbidity and mortality. Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested in a cohort of 75,227 patients requiring vaccination. During the 1999-2000 influenza A(H 3 N 2 ) epidemic, incident cases who died during the influenza epidemic or who required primary or secondary care for influenza, pneumonia, acute lung disease, myocardial infarction, stroke or heart failure were compared with controls regarding vaccination status. Estimates of the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing these endpoints were adjusted for confounding using stratified multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: After adjustments, vaccination prevented 46% of GP visits (95% confidence interval [CI]: )6% to 72%, p = 0.068) among first starting high-risk children aged under 18 years. Among first starting high-risk persons aged between 18 and 64 years, 14% (95% CI: )28% to 41%, p = 0.463) of GP visits, 97% (95% CI: 27% to 99%, p = 0.030) of hospitalisations and 63% (95% CI: 1% to 84%, p = 0.047) of deaths were prevented. Corresponding figures for elderly persons were -32% (95% CI: )78 to 3%, p = 0.063), 32% ()44% to 68%, p = 0.308) and -60% ()177 to 7%, p = 0.097). Conclusion: These data confirm low effectiveness of influenza vaccination among first starting elderly persons. However, younger adults and children with high-risk medical conditions benefit from the vaccine even when receiving the vaccine for the first time.",

However, results were conflicting, and the statistical power was often too small. To overcome these problems a meta-analysis was performed. Methods: A PUBMED and EMBASE search was conducted with the terms: 'influenza' AND 'vaccine' AND 'sickness absence OR employees OR personnel'. Thirty papers were selected which were possibly suitable for the analysis. These papers were scored by two independent investigators with the help of a standardised form for methods and results. The most important selection criteria were: the study should be a double blind, randomised trial and the paper should contain data on the number of sick leave days of vaccinees and non-vaccinees. The meta-analysis was performed in Review Manager 4.2. Results: Six papers were suitable for analysis. None of the studies recorded whether sick employees were tested for influenza. The total number of vaccinated persons was 4346 and of non-vaccinated persons (controls) 2881. The mean difference of sick leave days between vaccinated and nonvaccinated employees was 0.05 days in favour of vaccinated employees (95% CI 0.01-0.08, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Employees vaccinated for influenza have significantly less sick leave days, however the mean difference with non-vaccinated employees is very small.

The immunization rates during these two vaccination campaigns were 84%, 60%, 44% and 18% for doctors, nurses, paramedics and administrative staff respectively. 32% of the HCWs had their decision influenced by the infection control practitionners. The face to face discussions were the most important for 48% of HCWs. Protection of both themselves and the patients was the main reason of immunization for 69% of HCWs. The main reasons for refusal in 2003 were feeling of good health (49%), not being convinced by the vaccine efficacy (35%), fear of adverse events evoked by the media (17%) and reactions to previous vaccination (8%). After getting the results of this audit, we targeted the next campaign towards patients and self-protection, insisted on vaccine efficacy and safety and provided a feedback showing a reduction of nosocomial influenza since vaccination. In 2004, the immunization rate obtained was 73% in mid-november. Conclusions: Infection control practitionners' vaccination campaigns allowed to reach a good immunization rate among our HCWs. Most HCWs do get vaccinated for both self protection and patients protection. Face to face discussions were important to convince HCWs about vaccine efficacy and safety. Vaccination coverage was highest in doctors and lowest in administrative staff. Background: Before 2002, the immunization rate of the healthcare workers (HCWs) of our hospital was negligeable. Since then, influenza immunization has been offered to HCWs. Vaccination coverage reached 48% in 2002 and 47% in 2003. Current national vaccine recommendations do not include flu vaccine except for children with underlying conditions. Objectives: To study nosocomial influenza A in our 170 beds pediatric hospital and to evaluate the impact of vaccination of HCWs on nosocomial influenza rate. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed nosocomial influenza A cases during 5 seasons from 1999 to 2004. We compared the first period of the study (3 seasons) with the second period (2 seasons post implementation of vaccination). Nosocomial cases were defined as a positive culture from naso-pharyngeal aspirate obtained 48 h after admission and prompted by newly appeared symptoms compatible with influenza. Results: Influenza A was recovered in 579 flu episodes during the 5 seasons. Out of 237 (146 for period 1 and 92 for period 2) influenza A positive cultures recorded in in-patients, 62 (26%) were hospital acquired. 18/62 patients with hospital acquired influenza (29%) had a prolonged hospital stay (median = 2 days, range 1 to 5 days). For 8/62 (13%), an antibiotic treatment was initiated. 22/62 (35%) had a chest x-ray performed. Nosocomial influenza rate dropped from 34% (49/146) of hospitalized influenza cases during period 1 to 14% (13/92) during period 2 (p < 0.001). Among the 62 nosocomial influenza patients, 26 (42%) were less than 24 months old and 33 (53%) had an underlying disease. The rate of at risk patients was unchanged during the 2 study periods (27/49 versus 6/13). The majority (15/33) of patients with underlying disease were cardiac patients from Algeria (no influenza immunization). Their nosocomial influenza rate decreased from 9% (13/146) to 2 % (2/92) between the 2 periods (p = 0.05). In children <2 years old without risk factor, nosocomial flu rate was reduced from 5% (7/146) to 0% (0/92) (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Influenza A disease was associated with a longer length of stay in 29% of the nosocomial cases and chest x-ray were performed in 35% of the patients. A significant decrease in nosocomial influenza A disease was observed in children after immunization of nearly 50% of the HCWs in our pediatric hospital. It was observed in children with underlying cardiac disease but also in young children of less than 24 months without risk factor. New drugs to fight the resistance challenge Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a well known opportunistic pathogen and biofilm former, utilizes intercellular communicationquorum sensing -to coordinate virulence expression during invasion of and establishment in the hosts. Traditional treatment of infectious diseases is based on compounds which kill or inhibit growth of bacteria. A major concern with this approach is the frequent development of resistance to antibiotics. Furthermore, traditional antibiotics have little or no effect on bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth. In recent years, we have put much effort into the development of quorum sensing inhibitors in order to establish a non-antibiotic chemotherapy for patients infected with 'quorum sensing' bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our approach is based on natural signal antagonists isolated from the environment. Fungi, plants, sponges and seaweeds are devoid of advanced immune systems but some have evolved to rely, at least in part, on secondary metabolite chemistry for protection against colonizing or competing bacteria. Hence, the study of cross-kingdom signal interference might turn out to be the source of new anti-microbial compounds. We present the design and demonstrate the usefulness of a novel tool for screening purposes the quorum sensing inhibitor selector (QSI-selector). QSI activity in the extracts of fungi, plants, sponges and seaweeds was verified by means of transcriptome analysis using Pseudomonas aeruginosa DNA micro arrays. The influence on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm structure and antibiotic tolerance was established using the flow cell biofilm system. Whether the selected extract had an effect on the pathogenecity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was evaluated using a nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans and a mouse pulmonary model. We have also assessed the molecular mechanism of inhibition and assessed the probability of development of resistance towards the QSI compounds. Our results demonstrate that eukaryotic organisms produce compounds capable of interfering with prokaryotic communication. Furthermore, these organisms contain quorum sensing' bacteria indicating that the plants and fungi does not produce these compounds by happenstance. Using DNA micro arrays we have identified genes involved in interactions between biofilms and neutrophils and assessed the effect of QS and QSIs on these genes. Objectives: Epilancin 15X is a novel lantibiotic peptide, produced by a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The objectives of this work are: 1. to determine the structure of this peptide and 2. to test an array of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), for their susceptibility to epilancin 15X. Methods: NMR-spectra of purified epilancin 15X were recorded by total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY), natural abundance 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) and 1H-13C heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC). From these spectra a putative peptide structure was derived, which was then confirmed by nano-scale liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for epilancin 15X were determined for Staphylococcus aureus (10 methicillin susceptible and 10 methicillin resistant strains), coagulase negative staphylococci (10 strains) and enterococci (10 vancomycin susceptible and 5 vancomycin resistant strains) in a microtiter assay in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. Results: Epilancin 15X contains 31 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 3,173 Daltons. It contains ten posttranslationally modified amino acids, three lanthionine ring structures and a hydroxy-propionyl N-terminal moiety. The peptide was found to highly resemble the previously identified lantibiotic epilancin K7, with 68% amino acid sequence identity and three nearly identical lanthionine rings. The MIC for Staphylococcus aureus strains (both methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant) ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 lg/ml, for enterococci from <0.125 to 1.0 lg/ml and for coagulase negative staphylococci from <0.125 to 0.25 lg /ml. Conclusion: We here present the structure of epilancin 15X, a novel lantibiotic peptide which exhibits a high activity against Gram positive organisms; further studies will have to establish whether it could be of clinical use. Objective: To clarify the potential antioxidant properties of oleuropein, a phenolic secoiridoid glucoside present in olive trees and virgin olive oil, in experimental sepsis induced by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. Methods: Sepsis was induced in 17 rabbits by a single injection of a multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa isolate into the right renal pelvis following ureter ligation. Rabbits were divided into two groups; A: controls, and B: treated with one single iv dose of 1 ml of oleuropein (20 mg) diluted to 30 ml with D/W 5% upon signs of sepsis. Survival was recorded and blood was sampled for the estimation of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and total antioxidant status (TAS). MDA was determined by the thiobarbiturate assay followed by HPLC analysis; TNF by a bioassay on L929 fibrosarcoma cell line; and TAS by a colorimetric assay. Results: Survival curves are shown in Figure 1 . Mean concentration of MDA before and 1.5, 3. Comparison of TAS between groups was found statistically significant (P between group A and group B 0.043). Negative correlation was found between MDA and TAS for group A (p = 0.017), but not for group B. Significant differences in bacterial load of liver, kidney, spleen and lower right lung lobe between two groups were not recorded. Conclusion: Administration of oleuropein prolonged survival in experimental sepsis induced by multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. Its effect might be connected to enhancement of TAS accompanied by decreases of TNF. The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant microorganism of chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa colonizes the lungs by forming biofilm microcolonies through out the lung. Quorum sensing (QS) renders the biofilm growing bacteria highly tolerant to otherwise lethal doses of antibiotics, and protect from the bactericidal activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). We have previously demonstrated that QS is inhibited by garlic extract. In this study we have evaluated the effect of garlic for the interaction between P. aeruginosa and tobramycin and the PMNs and outcome of pulmonary infection. P. aeruginosa was grown in vitro in continuous-culture once-through flow chambers with and without garlic extract. 3 day old biofilms were treated with 340 lg/ml of tobramycin continuously for 48 hours or human PMNs. The garlic treated biofilm was susceptible to both tobramycin and grazing of PMNs. The PMNs showed an increased activation, when incubated on the garlic treated biofilm. The differences in sensitivity were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy of 'live-dead' stained biofilms, and the degradation of GFP tagged biofilms. The activation of PMNs was visualised by staining the PMNs with 123-dihydrorhodamine, which is oxidised to 123-rhodamine when H 2 O 2 is produced -respiratory burst. Mice were treated with garlic extract or saline for 7 days, 2 day profylactic. P. aeruginosa was instilled in the left lung of the mice for up to 5 days. Bacteriology, mortality, histopathology, and cytokine production was used as endpoints. The results indicate that a QS inhibitory extract of garlic renders Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensitive to both tobramycin and, phagocytosis, and respiratory burst of polymorphonuclear neutrophile leukocytes. Garlic treatment of a pulmonary mouse model initially provokes a higher degree of inflammation and improved clearing of the infecting bacteria.",

Ipsat's novel beta-lactamase product aims to prevent such disturbance due to beta-lactam antibiotics by degrading the portion of antibiotic excreted into the small intestine without affecting systemic antibiotic levels. The aim of this Phase II study was to administer Ipsat's product, P1A, simultaneously with i.v. ampicillin and investigate the preventive effects and safety. Methods: The study included three parallel groups of 12 healthy volunteers (males and females) per group. For 5 days, Group 1 received 1 g ampicillin qid, Group 2 received 8.2 mg Ipsat P1A qid and Group 3 received both treatments simultaneously. Stool samples were collected before, during and 7 days after treatment. Changes in stool microflora were measured using 16S rRNA fingerprints of bacteria and quantifying the major anaerobic and aerobic bacterial groups. The emergence of resistance was assessed by quantifying ampicillin-resistant coliforms and by measuring the changes (increase) in ampicillin resistant marker genes (TEM-family). Results: Ampicillin treatment caused greater than a 50% change (p < 0.0001) in the microflora, greater than an 80% increase (p < 0.0001) in ampicillin-resistant coliforms and a highly significant increase in ampicillin resistant marker genes, whereas concurrent treatment with Ipsat P1A completely prevented these changes. Ipsat P1A also prevented the selection of multi-drug resistant species including Klebsiella. No side effects or other safety concerns were noted with the Ipsat product. Conclusions: Oral administration of Ipsat P1A eliminated ampicillin-induced alterations of the intestinal microflora of healthy volunteers and prevented the ampicillin-induced emergence of bacterial resistance. These results suggest a new strategy for reducing antimicrobial resistance in humans.",

DB289 is the orally bioavailable prodrug of DB75, a novel diphenylfuran diamidine, that is active in vitro against P. carinii and in murine models of PCP. Methods: Patients were \u202118 year with weight \u202145 kg and had documented PCP and HIV. Baseline PO 2 was \u202160 mmHg. Two dose regimens were tested sequentially, 50 mg and 100 mg DB289 twice a day for 21 days. Patients were followed for 42 days with scoring of symptoms, ECG, chest X-ray, blood gases, and laboratory safety evaluations. DB289/DB75 plasma kinetics were evaluated on Days 7 and 14 throughout 12 hours, and predose levels were taken on Days 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21. Results: 35 patients were enrolled; 8 in the 50 mg group and 27 in the 100 mg group. All patients responded to treatment. Patients treated with 100 mg had a faster reduction of their symptom scores and normalization of blood-gases parameters compared to patients treated with 50 mg, with maximal effect observed by Day 10. There were no treatment failures with 100 mg DB289. Tolerance with DB289 treatment was good. Treatment was withdrawn for a patient after 12 days due to progression of underlying renal insufficiency. Other significant adverse events included two cases of moderate muscle pain/ weakness. Treatment with DB289 resulted in sustained DB75 plasma levels throughout the dosing interval. Mean DB75 exposure after 100 mg was 6-times that observed after 50 mg. Pre-dose trough levels indicated some DB75 accumulation, consistent with the long terminal half-life observed for DB75 of over 80 hours, with steady state achieved between Days 10-14.

Tea tree oil (TTO) has recently emerged as an effective topical antibacterial agent for the treatment of local skin infections including acne. Objectives: This study sought to evaluate TTO efficacy in comparison to topical erythromycin for the treatment of acne. Patients/Methods: Sixty volunteer patients with mild to moderate inflammatory acne lesions, aged between 15 to 25 years old were selected, randomly devided into two groups and treated with topical 5% TTO or 2% erythromycin gel twice daily for six weeks on an investigator-blinded protocol. Severity and number of acne lesions were evaluated before and after the study course. Results: The average reduction of acne lesions was higher in the TTO compared to erythromycin treated group ( Fig. 1 , P < 0.001). Meanwhile, in the TTO group, 87.5% of cases had more than 50% reduction in acne lesions, which was significantly higher as compared to 53.8% in erythromycin group (Fig. 2 , P < 0.01). The drop out rate due to severity of side effects in erythromycin group was significantly higher compared to TTO (P < 0.01). There were not any significant differences between frequency of side effects and relapse rate between two groups. Conclusions: These results indicate that topical 5% tea tree oil in gel base is an effective and safe topical antibacterial agent for treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris.",

Few randomized controlled trials have compared the efficacy of different antibiotic regimens for DFI. Most previous studies were small and not blinded. Methods: This double-blind randomized study was designed to determine noninferiority of intravenous (IV) ertapenem (E) to piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T) (3.375 g qid) for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe DFI. IV antibiotic therapy was required for a minimum of 5 days. Patients could be switched to oral therapy (amoxicillin/clavulanate) for a maximum cumulative treatment of 28 days. Baseline and follow-up visits included evaluation of tissue wound cultures and quantitative wound scores. Assessments were made at discontinuation of IV therapy (DCIV) and at day 10 post-treatment (IV or IV and oral if given) follow-up. Results: 576 patients were randomized to treatment (E: 289; P/ T:287); 445 were clinically evaluable at the end of IV therapy (E: 226; P/T: 219). The mean duration of IV therapy was 11.1 d for E and 11.3 d for P/T. Clinical success rates were similar between the treatments at DCIV (E: 94.2%, P/T: 92.2%; between treatment difference: 1.9; 95% CI: )2.9, 6.9). In the microbiologically evaluable population, the overall rate of eradication (presumed or documented) at the 10 d follow-up was also comparable (E: 87.8%, P/T: 84.4%; between treatment difference: 3.4%; 95% CI: )4.5, 11.9). Clinical response rates were similar in both treatment groups across baseline wound scores and the response rates generally decreased with increasing baseline wound scores. There were no differences in drug-related adverse events during parenteral therapy (E: 15.2%, P/T: 19.9%; RR E/(P/T): 0.77; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.10; p = 0.147) or discontinuations due to drug-related adverse events during parenteral therapy (E: 1.0%, P/T: 2.1%; RR E/(P/T) 0.50; 95% CI: 0.15, 1.94; p = 0.341).",

Vergison (Brussels, B) Objectives: To evaluate the impact of antibiotics policies in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a 170-beds pediatric teaching hospital between 2001 & 2003. The ICU is a 16-beds medical and surgical unit (8 intensive and 8 medium care). Antibiotic guidelines in the ICU aimed at (1) decrease the share of broadspectrum antibiotics, (2) switch to narrow spectrum antibiotics whenever possible (3) reduce the empirical treatment durations and (4) reduce amikacin and vancomycin consumption. Methods: Starting in march 2002, regular information was provided on local epidemiology and antibiotic resistance (MRSA, ESBL,) during seminars (3/year) and bedside discussions were performed on a regular basis (minimum twice a week) with the infectious disease specialist. Antibiotics consumption were analyzed through pharmacy billing data. Data were expressed in DDD/100 patient-days (PD). Broad spectrum antibiotics included Amoxicillin-Clavulanate (AC), Ceftriaxone, Ceftazidime, Cefotaxime, Cefepime and Meropenem. Narrow spectrum drugs used were flucloxacillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin and penicillin. Results: Broad spectrum antibiotics decreased from 33 to 26 DDD/100PD between 2001 and 2003. Amoxicillin-clavulanate reduction was the most important (11 to 5 DDD/100PD). Narrow spectrum drugs increased from 8 to 12 DDD/100PD. Amikacin decreased from 4.2 to 1.8 DDD/100PD and vancomycin from 8.65 to 6 DDD/100 PD. Cefuroxime increased from 2.83 to 9.05 DDD/100PD and oral ciprofloxacin from 0.7 to 1.95 DDD/100PD. Total AB consumption in the ICU remained stable (57 DDD/100PD. Conclusions: Antibiotic use analysis for ICU showed: (1) a decrease in broad spectrum antibiotics together with an increase in Narrow spectrum drug use, (2) a reduction of Amikacin and Vancomycin use, (3) The data obtained represent encouraging information feedback for physicians in the ICU and emphasize the need for collaboration between ICU physicians and infectious disease specialist.

A full characterization of MRSA strains requires structure determination of the complex SCCmec element. In addition to the SCCmec types I-V, several subtypes have been described. Most recently, a progressive replacement of type II SCCmecbearing isolates with type IV SCCmec-bearing isolates, which coincided with >4-fold increase in methicillin resistance was reported.

It represented the first principally new class of antibiotics developed in the last 25 years. The site and mode of oxazolidinone action, the nature of side effects and mechanisms of resistance are only starting to be unraveled. Oxazolidinones bind to the ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis in sensitive bacteria. Though oxazolidinones inhibit cell-free translation they bind only weakly to isolated ribosomes, which complicated identification of the site of their action. Therefore, the majority of our knowledge about the site and mechanism of action of oxazolidinones comes from in vivo studies. Crosslinking of photoreactive oxazolidinones to their target in living bacteria revealed the ribosomal peptidyl transferase centre as the main site of oxazolidinone action. The use of various photoreactive derivatives allowed for the accurate modelling of the structure of oxazolidinone drug in the ribosome-bound state. Crosslinking results are in excellent agreement with mutational analysis: all the well-characterized oxazolidinone-resistance mutations are clustered in 23S rRNA at or near the ribosomal peptidyl transferase centre. However, ribosomes of different species show remarkable idiosyncrasy in the type and position of oxazolidinone resistance mutations, suggesting that mutations may have different cost of fitness in ribosomes of different organisms. Oxazolidinone resistance mutations in rRNA are co-dominant and confer resistance even in the presence of wild type ribosomes in the cell. The extent of resistance correlates with the number of ribosomal RNA operons carrying the mutation.S131Macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin resistance by ribosome methylation R. Leclercq (Caen, F) Cross resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins B (the MLSB phenotype) is spread in a variety of micro-organisms and is due to ribosomal modification by methylation. Nearly forty different erm gene classes responsible for ribosomal modification are distinguished. According to the class of erm gene, the Erm methylases can monomethylate or dimethylate adenine at position 2048 (E. coli numbering) in the 23S rRNA. Generally, each class of erm gene is found in a limited number of bacterial genera. This is the case for staphylococci where three erm genes, erm(A), erm(B), and erm(C) account for nearly all the isolates with the MLSB phenotype and for streptococci where the erm(B) and erm(TR) [a subset of the erm(A) class] genes are widely distributed.",

Kehrel (Munster, Homburg/Saar, D)Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a predominant cause of infective endocarditis (IE), which often is fatal with mortality rates of 20-40%. The pathogenesis of IE is characterized by a series of events: initial endocardial damage results in exposure of the subendothelium and subsequent deposition of platelets and fibrin. The fibrin-platelet matrix on the damaged valves may serve as binding foci for adhering bacteria. The ability of S. aureus to adhere to platelets and to induce platelet aggregation is considered as a critical factor in S. aureusassociated IE. To identify and characterize bacterial factors involved in the S. aureus-platelet interaction, we generated a phage display library of S. aureus genomic DNA and a phagemid vector. The library was affinity-panned against gel-filtered, immobilized platelets. Repeatedly isolated clones contained either a portion of the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus coagulase or the N-terminal domain of the extracellular fibrinogen (Fg)-binding protein Efb. The S. aureus coagulase and Efb may interact with platelets via Fg as a bridging molecule. In another approach, repeatedly isolated clones contained overlapping DNA fragments encoding a portion of the S. aureus fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs).",

Gu\u00e9gan (Montpellier, Paris, F)Cholera is an ancient disease which had disappeared from most of the developed countries in the last 50 years, but it still persists in many parts of the world with serious epidemics most often localized in tropical areas. This highly contagious disease is due to the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, after ingestion of contaminated water or seafood. V. cholerae is naturally present in the environment and is autochthonous to coastal and estuarine ecosystems. The bacteria is closely associated with many phyto-or zooplankton organisms. Thus any environmental, ecological impact on V. cholerae reservoirs density may have some incidences in bacterial population density. In this context, climatic and/or environmental, ecological changes influencing V. cholerae reservoirs density may be particularly involved in the emergence of cholera in human populations by increasing the probability of contacts between bacterial populations in the ecosystem and riverine human populations. Objectives: The present work aims at determining and quantifying the relationships between climatic/environmental factors and cholera populations dynamics, i.e. the evolution of case numbers with time, across several countries in the Equatorial Atlantic Coast (Gulf of Guinea). Methods: In a first part, cholera population dynamics is studied using wavelets analysis to characterize the observed dynamics and to synchronism between the different countries. Secondly, climatic indicators (e.g. S.O.I) and space oceanography variables (e.g. Sea Surface Temperature) are also analyzed with similar questions. Finally, results are crossed between environmental variables and disease timeseries in order to detect the existence of correlations and phase delays. Results: We observed an important synchrony between cholera epidemics for Benin, Ghana, Republic Demographic of Togo and Nigeria for the period 1987 to 1994, and this was highly synchronized with some climatic and/or oceanographic parameters.Conclusion: This comparative approach should allow a better understanding and quantification of the importance of climatic and environmental fluctuations on cholera epidemics in human populations at both the global and regional scales. This work is then a first step toward the objective of building a predictive model for the risk of environmental emergence of Vibrio bacteria in human populations.",

Agnandji, M.A. Missinou, S. Issifou, W. Graninger, P.G. Kremsner (Vienna, A; Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, GAB)Objective: Artemisinin based drug combinations are the mainstay in the fight against drug resistant malaria in Africa. Currently available antimalarial drug combinations including artemisinins are pharmacokinetically unmatched and are therefore potentially increasing the risk of selecting resistant mutants in areas of high malaria transmission. We aimed to test the potential value of short half-life artemisinin based combination therapy for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.Methods:We conducted an open label randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 3 days twice daily, oral artesunate-clindamycin therapy (2 mg/kg and 7 mg/kg per dose) compared to a standard quinine-clindamycin regimen (15 mg/kg and 7 mg/kg per dose) in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in 100 Gabonese children aged 3 to 12 years. Results: Artesunate-clindamycin showed comparable activity to quinine-clindamycin in the per-protocol analysis of day-28 cure rates (87% versus 94%). No serious adverse events were reported and tolerability was similar in both groups. Fever and parasite clearance times were significantly shorter in the artesunate clindamycin group.Conclusions: Artesunate-clindamycin and other matching short plasma half-life combinations of artemisinins merit further attention in regions with high malaria transmission.O204 Microarray based analysis of gene expression in drug resistant Leishmania donovani isolated from Indian patients of Kala azar P.

Many TB cases originate among prisoners where the rates are the highest. Previous studies demonstrated the dominance of Beijing strains in some parts of Russia and other FSU countries and suggested its increased virulence and associations with resistance. Objective: To address: (1) the extent of 'Beijing strain' transmission in the prison/civil sectors; (2) the association of drug resistance, clinical and social factors with the Beijing genotype. Design: Prospective population-based molecular epidemiological study. Setting: All civilian and penitentiary TB facilities in Samara Region, Russia Patients: 880 consecutively recruited patients with tuberculosis. Results: Beijing-family strains (comprised of two main MIRU types) were highly prevalent: 568/880 (66.6%, 95% CI 63.4-69.7%) with a significantly higher prevalence in the prison population (RR = 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.5) and those aged under 35 (RR = 1.2 (95% CI 1.0-1.3). It supports recent and active transmission particularly among prisoners who are younger than civil patients. Comparable proportions were co-infected with HIV (~10%), hepatitis B/C (~one-fifth), drank alcohol, smoked and had a similar sexual history.

As residents in nursing homes often are transferred between different health care institutions, nursing homes can serve as a reservoir for MRSA strains resulting in outbreaks in other health care institutions. During the period 1999-2000 an outbreak was discovered in a nursing home (no. I) in the South-Eastern part of Norway. The outbreak was discovered by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) typing, and thought to be cleared after infection control interventions in June 2000. In May 2003 another MRSA outbreak occurred at a second nursing home (no. II) situated in the same county as nursing home I. The two nursing homes have an exchange of residents and transfer residents to the same hospital. Reanalysis of all MRSA isolates from both outbreaks were done to investigate the possibility of an ongoing MRSA outbreak having lasted for 4 years.",

The first CAMRSA in the southern Stockholm area was documented year 2000. The present study is aimed at understanding the molecular epidemiology of CAMRSA in the southern Stockholm area. Methods: The CAMRSA isolates detected during 2000 and 2003 were investigated. The strains were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing, and staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) analysis. The presence of the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (pvl) genes was detected by PCR. The antibiograms of the isolates were determined by disk diffusion method. Results: 38 CAMRSA isolates were detected during 2000 and 2003, which accounted for 21% of the 181 new MRSA cases under the period. These isolates presented 12 PFGE patterns and belonged to 10 MRSA clones. Among these clones, ST80-MRSA-IV was the only clone persistent through all the 4 years. Clone ST8-MRSA-IV emerged in 2001 and the frequency went down afterwards. ST150 was a new MLST type reported so far only from Sweden.",

Since the discovery of PVL positive MRSA strains in the Netherlands, all MRSA isolates of the national surveillance programme are routinely tested for the presence of the PVL loci.

In May 2003 the society of hospital epidemiology of America presented new guidelines for prevention of nosocomial transmission of MRSA, stressing the need for increased surveillance. Therefore, the objectives of the current study were to evaluate the influence of active surveillance cultures for MRSA, on the incidence of nosocomial MRSA bacteraemia cases in our hospital. Methods: In June 2003 new guidelines for MRSA active surveillance cultures were implemented in our hospital. Surveillance cultures were recommended for all high risk patients. Contact isolation was implemented for patients with positive cultures. The total number of surveillance cultures, the per cent of positive surveillance cultures and the number of MRSA bacteraemia cases before and after the intervention were compared (January 2002 to February 2003 -before intervention and July 2003 to October 2004 -after intervention).Results: The number of surveillance cultures increased from a mean of 272 cultures per month before the intervention, to 836 cultures per month after the intervention. The per cent of positive surveillance cultures increased from 2.4% before, to 5.9% after the intervention. The number of positive MRSA bacteraemia cases per month decreased from a mean of 3.6 before the intervention to a mean of 1.9 cases after the intervention (p = 0.0003). Moreover, the trend line for new bacteremic patients changed from a slope indicating a constant increase (R 2 = 0.2), to an almost flat trend line (R 2 = 0.01)(Fig. 1).Conclusions: Active surveillance cultures are important in order to identify the hidden reservoir of MRSA cases. Contact isolation can prevent new colonization and infection, thus resulting in significant reduction of morbidity and healthcare costs.",

Kulwichit (Bangkok, TH)Objectives: Dengue infection has emerged as a global public health problem. PCR and ELISA are used for diagnosis. We evaluated utilities of PCR and ELISA performed on dried blood spots on filter paper for dengue diagnosis in acute febrile patients.Methods: A descriptive observational study was conducted in acute febrile pediatric and adult patients at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, between June 2003 to April 2004. Diagnosis of dengue infection was based on standard serum ELISA assay. Patients tested negative by serum ELISA served as controls. Whole blood (WB) was collected on the first day of admission and again 1-2 weeks after discharge. Dried blood spots were stored on filter paper which was kept at 4 degrees for at least 10 days before testing. Reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested PCR) and ELISA were performed on extracts from the spots. Blood spots with IgM over 40 units Results: We enrolled 102 patients with dengue infection (6 primary and 96 secondary cases) and 33 patients with other infectious diseases. Dried blood spots from 134 patients (101 cases and 33 controls) were tested by ELISA, and from 80 patients (65 cases and 15 controls) for RT-nested PCR.

A selection of probes was used that should identify >95% of pathogens most commonly found in blood cultures. To determine the clinical impact of FISH identification, results and time points were compared between conventional identification and FISH. Results: One-hundred and fifty blood cultures were included. FISH allowed identification of 117 pathogens (78%) at the species level(table 1). For pathogens identified at the genus level or with eubacterial probes no species specific probes are available, including Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Identification was suboptimal in 3 cases: 2 with Staphylococcus aureus that were identified as Staphylococcus species and 1 with Escherichia coli that was identified as a lactose fermenting rod. In 8 cases no micro-organisms were found with Gram-stain and FISH. Average time to identification with FISH was 3.5 hours for gram-negative and 4 hours for gram-positive organisms. Identification by FISH correlates well with conventional culture identification. In three cases identification with FISH was suboptimal because of difficult interpretation of fluorescence due to the presence of large amounts of protein and cells. The panel of probes should be extended to permit identification of >95% of pathogens; based on the results from our study probes for Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis would be of interest. FISH allows faster identification compared to conventional methods in a routine setting. This can be especially useful for blood cultures that are growth-positive in the afternoon. For these, FISH results will be available the same day with treatment benefits for the patient, whereas conventional identification will require overnight incubation. If the turnaround time of the FISH procedure could be further decreased and the panel of probes extended, FISH would provide a valuable diagnostic improvement to the microbiological laboratory.Detection of Salmonella antibodies by flagellabased ELISA has potential for diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis T. Dalby, M. Strid, K.A. Krogfelt (Copenhagen, DK) Objectives: Diagnosis of human gastrointestinal salmonellosis is traditionally done by fecal culturing and agglutination assays. An automatized ELISA is an obvious candidate for a more reliable, fast and easy method of diagnosis. An indirect ELISA employing repolymerized flagella antigens was developed and evaluated. Methods: Two automatized indirect ELISAs employing re-polymerized Salmonella flagella were developed; H:[g,m] flagella respectively H:[i:1,2] flagella were used. Both IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies were detected. Sera from 153 Danish patients diagnosed with infection by Salmonella enteritidis (SE) and from 150 Danish patients diagnosed with infection by Salmonella typhimurium (ST) were obtained and analysed. Most patients delivered blood-samples at approximately one, three and six months after onset of salmonellosis. Cut-off values were determined as the 90 percentile when analysing sera from more than 100 healthy, Danish blood-donors.Results: The developed ELISAs proved reliable, and at approx. one month after onset of salmonellosis, anti-flagella antibodies were detected with 70% of the SE-patients and 77% of the ST-patients; in comparison, a combined O-and H-agglutination assay detected only 44% of the SE-patients and 8% of the ST-patients. Three months after onset of salmonellosis, just 46% of the SE-patients were detected as were 40% of the ST-patients. Six months after onset, these detection-rates had decreased to 34% and 38%. Crossreactions between H:[g,m] and H:[i:1,2] antiflagella antibodies were found. Similarly, crossreactions to antibodies against other gastrointestinal flagellated bacteria were observed.",

Zingg, A. Imhof, E. Ehrenreich, C. Ruef (Zurich, CH)Objective: To study the impact of teaching interventions on the compliance of hand disinfection by healthcare workers (HCW) in ICU and on the rate of central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) in ICU patients. Compliance of HCW in ICU with hand disinfection was significantly higher during period II than during period I (65% versus 59% overall). Overall compliance with hand disinfection was higher after patient contact than before patient contact. The proportion of technically correct hand disinfection increased from 22.5 to 42.6% overall (before patient contact from 26% to 45%, after patient contact from 21 to 56%). The incidence density (infections/1000 catheter days) of CR-BSI was 4.4 during period I and 1.4 during period II (p < 0.001). CR-BSI was a highly significant risk factor for a lethal outcome (8.8% in both periods): odds ratio 2.7 [period I], 2.65 [period II]. Independent risk factors for the development of CR-BSI were: catheter use >7 days, length of stay >10 days, Charlson index 3, presence of a nosocomial infection at another anatomical site. Gram positive bacteria were responsible for 81% of CR-BSI, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%) and gram negative bacteria (8.1%). Conclusions: Teaching of standards of catheter care as well as indications and proper technique for hand disinfection are successful interventions to reduce the rate of CR-BSI. While overall compliance with hand disinfection was relatively high compared with published studies, disinfection was frequently performed using inadequate technique. Monitoring of compliance with hand disinfection should include some parameters that allow to assess the quality of hand disinfection as well. As many identified risk factors of CR-BSI are not modifiable, strategies to reduce the risk of CR-BSI should focus on the quality of catheter care and hand disinfection. Prevention of urinary tract infection in spinal cord-injured patients: safety and efficacy of a weekly oral cyclic antibiotic programme J. Salomon, P. Denys, C. Merle, J.L. Gaillard, C.M. Perronne, L. Bernard (Garches, F) Background: Spinal cord injury patients with a neurogenic bladder have an increased risk for a UTI. Patients who have recurrent UTI receive multiple courses of antibiotic therapy, markedly increasing the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and health care costs. Aim: To determine the safety and efficacy of a weekly oral cyclic antibiotic (WOCA) regimen to prevent UTI in a prospective cohort study of paralyzed patients with neurogenic bladder undergoing intermittent catheterization for bladder drainage. Method: We examined the impact of a WOCA programme upon the number of cases of UTI, antibiotic tolerance, and the occurrence of ARB (anal and urinary samples). The WOCA prophylaxis consists in the alternant administration of a dose of antibiotic (amoxicilline 3000 mg, cefixime 600 mg, fosfomycintrometamol 6000 mg, nitrofurantoin 200 mg, or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole 1600-320 mg) once weekly. During week A, the patient takes a single antibiotic (antibiotic A), and the following week (week B) the patient receives another antibiotic (antibiotic B). Antibiotic was specifically adapted according to the recent culture of a 6 week urine specimen. Results: 32 patients (17 men, 15 women; mean age, 47 years) with neurogenic bladder were included. Before starting the WOCA program, patients had presented with 8.8 symptomatic UTI/year (included 162 febrile UTI: 37 prostatitis, 5 orchitis, 120 acute pyelonephritis; 45 hospitalizations). Following antibiotic prophylaxis (follow-up of 2 years), there were 2 symptomatic UTI/year (included 18 febrile UTI: 12 acute pyelonephritis, 6 prostatitis; 7 hospitalizations). Greater than 90 % of the patients were careful to take their prophylactic therapy as directed. No severe adverse events were reported and no new case of colonization with multi ARB was reported. Conclusion: WOCA prophylaxis reduces the number of UTI in patients with neurogenic bladder susceptible to recurrent infection.",

The Joint Commission of the United States, when introducing their new Infection Control standards for 2005, pointed out that it must not be a 'knee jerk reaction', relegating hospital infection as merely the 'problem of the month' but rather it ought to be a long-term commitment to ensure patient safety. The challenge now is to use the opportunity for establishing the proper infrastructure for Infection Control and the essential ingredients would be discussed. Summary data of the situation in various countries including Hong Kong would be presented. The challenges ahead are for Infection Control to focus on the relevant issues, which can generate worthwhile long-term results. This would include a discussion on the 'Seven Healthcare Safety Challenges' for Infection Control presently promoted by the Center for Disease Control (United States) and the areas of focus for Infection Control by the World Alliance for Patient Safety of the WHO. One must avoid the tendency to over-react because of a severe outbreak like SARS. It includes the over emphasis on intricate protocols for outbreak management or the building of expensive isolation facilities.

Results: In the period 2000 through 2003 approximately 10% of all Dutch hospital MRSA isolates carried the PVL loci, and molecular subtyping revealed two predominant PVL-MRSA genotypes: NL-28 (by PFGE) or sequence type (ST) 80 (by MLST) and NL-218 (PFGE type USA 300) or ST8. Molecular subtyping showed that most Dutch PVL-MRSA genotypes corresponded to well-documented global epidemic types. PVL-MRSA genotype ST80 is predominant in other European countries as well.Genotype ST8 has been found to be associated with outbreaks among jail inmates and gay men in the USA. Approximately 70% of the PVL-MRSA isolates were assigned staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV. Recent data have indicated the presence of SCCmec type IV in communityacquired MRSA. Conclusion: Forty per cent of the Dutch isolates were obtained from clinics. The data presented here for PVL-MRSA isolates seem to confirm the hypothesis that PVL-MRSA might spread in the hospital environment and also might be (come) a hospitalassociated public health threat.",

Methods: 1798 E. coli were isolated from rectal swabs taken from pigs, sheep and cattle upon entry to the abattoir. Their susceptibility profiles to a panel of 16 antibiotics were determined by disc susceptibility testing. The prevalence of 11 resistance genes as well as the Class 1 integrase gene was determined among 615 of these isolates by PCR. Both resistant and susceptible isolates were screened to identify expressed as well as unexpressed resistance genes. Results: The prevalence of antibiotic resistance among these isolates was low; only 9.1% of isolates were resistant to at least one agent. Of these, 5.2% were multi-resistant (defined as resistance to three or more agents of different classes). In terms of individual agents, resistance was 1.1% to apramycin, 2.4% to ampicillin, 0.1% to co-amoxiclav, 0.1% to cefoperazone, 1.2% to chloramphenicol, 3.5% to colistin, 1.6% to co-trimoxazole, 0.3% to furazolidone, 0.2% to gentamicin, 0.1% to nalidixic acid, 3.6% to neomycin, 4.3% to streptomycin, 4.6% to sulfonamide and 7.4% to tetracycline. There was no resistance to ceftazidime or amikacin. Of the ampicillin resistant isolates tested, 64.5% produced TEM type beta-lactamases, 19.4% produced OXA-2 type beta-lactamases and 0% produced SHV type betalactamases. Of the tetracycline resistant isolates tested 36.0% carried tetA and 73.0% carried tetB. Of the co-trimoxazole resistant isolates tested 12.5% carried dhfr17 or related genes and 16.7% carried dhfr12 or related genes.

Chopra (Leeds, UK)Objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonises the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients forming biofilms that are difficult to eradicate due to intrinsic expression of resistance and rapid development of acquired resistance. P. aeruginosa with elevated mutation frequencies (MFs) have been isolated from the lungs of CF patients, but have yet to be isolated from non-CF patients. Hypermutators may arise during biofilm growth as a consequence of enhanced mutability in DNA repair genes leading to permanent hypermutator strains. To address this possibility we compared MFs of P. aeruginosa grown as planktonic cells and as biofilms. We also examined the effect of a methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency on MF. Methods: MFs of planktonic P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PAOdelta mutS::Km, a MMR mutant, were determined by selecting mutants at 4xMIC rifampicin (rif) after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. Colony counts were expressed as a proportion of total viable cell numbers after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. P. aeruginosa biofilms were created using a modified Sorbarod model. Sorbarod filters were inoculated, perfused with media and maintained at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. Bacteria were harvested from the filter. MFs were determined as described. Results: P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PAOdelta mutS::Km biofilm cultures showed significantly elevated MFs when compared to planktonic cells. RifR PAO1 were recovered from the biofilm at a frequency of 3.42 \u00b1 2.02 \u00b7 10 )8 , and from planktonic cultures at 2.63 \u00b1 1.76 \u00b7 10 )9",

Blondeau, S. Borsos (Saskatoon, CAN) Objective: Mxf is amongst the most potent of newer fluoroquinolones (FQ) against SP. Previous MIC testing has shown an MIC90 of 0.25 lg/ml and an MPC90 of 1 lg/ml. Concern over the possible escalation of FQ resistant SP prompted us to evaluate MIC and MPC values for Mxf on a large number of SP isolates collected prior to and after the introduction of the drug into clinical use. Methods: A total of 454 clinical isolates collected between 1994-2003 were used: 365 PS, 76 PI, 13 PR. MIC testing was by microbroth dilution in accordance with NCCLS guidelines. For MPC testing, 10 billion organisms were applied to agar plates containing drug and incubated for 24 and 48 hours. The lowest drug concentration preventing growth was the MPC. Results: Against PSSP isolates (susceptibility lg/ml), MIC50/ 90, range and MPC50/90, range were as follows: 0.125/0.25, 0.031-4 and 0.5/1, 0.05-8; PI 0.125/0.25, \u00a30.031-4 and 0.5/1, 0.25- \u20218; PR 0.031/0.05, 0.31-0.5 and 0.5/1, 0.05-1. Only 1/454 (0.2%) strains had an MIC \u20212 lg/ml and 8/454 (1.7% had MPC > 2 lg/ml). No difference in the MIC or MPC drug inhibition distributions were seen against PS, PI or PR strains nor were there any changes in these distributions over time. Modal MIC and MPC values were constant. Greater than 99% of strains by MIC were inhibited by \u00a31 lg/ml compared to 95% by MPC and 98% by \u00a32 lg/ml. Conclusion: Mxf has enhanced in vitro activity against SP by both MIC and MPC measurements. Penicillin susceptibility of SP does not effect Mxf activity. No change in MIC nor MPC values of SP isolates collected prior to after release of the drug were seen. These studies confirm Mxf to be highly active in vitro and use of this compound does not appear to select for FQ resistance. This observation has long term implications for the use of FQs for treating SP infections.Infections in the community: epidemiology, diagnosis and outcomeO354 Evaluation of 4 serological tests for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in patients with lower respiratory tract infections K.

Ieven (Edegem, B) Objectives: Serology and PCR are widely used for diagnosis of M. pneumoniae (MP) in respiratory tract infections, but studies comparing the different methods are rare. The aim of this study was to evaluate PCR, NASBA and 4 different IgM and IgG EIA assays for the detection of MP in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Methods: 205 paired sera from 224 patients with CAP and 10 paired sera from 20 MP PCR positive patients without CAP were available. From 29 patients only an acute phase serum sample was available. Four different EIA's were evaluated: ImmunoWell IgG and IgM EIA (Genbio); Medac IgM, and IgG EIA (Medac); AniLabsystems IgM and IgG EIA (Biomedical Diagnostics); and Euroimmun IgM, and IgG EIA (Biognost).",
