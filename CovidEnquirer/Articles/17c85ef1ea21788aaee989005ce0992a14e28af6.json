According to the World Health Organization, it is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the world, and further increases in the prevalence and mortality of the disease is predicted for the coming decades. These increases are mainly linked to the epidemic of tobacco exposure and indoor and outdoor air pollution in Asian countries. The burden of COPD in Asia is currently greater than that in developed Western countries, both in terms of the total number of deaths and the burden of disease, as measured in years of life lost and years spent living with disability. The types of health-care policies and the practice of medicine vary considerably among the regions of Asia and have an impact on the burden of disease. Treatment aims in Asian countries are based on evidence-based management guidelines. Barriers to the implementation of disease management guidelines are related to issues of resource conflict and lack of organizational support rather than cultural differences in medical practice. To reduce this burden of COPD in Asian countries, there is a need for a multifaceted approach in improving awareness of prevalence and disease burden, in facilitating accurate diagnosis of COPD among chronic respiratory diseases, in championing health policies that reduce the burden of the main risk factors for COPD and in the wider use of evidence-based management for COPD.",

Uncertainty was larger for mortality from specific diseases, and for incidence and prevalence of nonfatal outcomes. Death registration data, containing useable information on cause-of-death distributions, may be patchy or not available. The proportion of deaths coded to illdefined causes such as COPD, has been found to vary from 4% in New Zealand to \u03fe 40% in Sri Lanka and Thailand. 1 Mortality COPD was the sixth-leading cause of death worldwide in 1990, but by 2002 the ranking had risen to fifth and is projected to double within the next 2 decades. 1 COPD was ranked as the fourth-leading cause of death in the United States in 2002, accounting for 4 to 5% of total deaths. 5 Rising trends in COPD mortality dating from 1990 have been reported in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, and Canada. 6 -10 Gender difference was observed in these trends with changes in previous male-dominated mortality rates rising more steeply among women than among men, as seen in North America. 6 Mortality rates in Asia are similar to or higher than those in the West. [11] [12] [13] COPD was listed as the seventh most common cause of death in China based on a national cohort study conducted in 2000. 13 However, COPD deaths were deduced from the deaths categorized as \"cardiopulmonary deaths/cor pulmonale,\" as there were no separate categories for COPD such as those based on the ICD codes. This diagnostic transfer coupled with a lack of death certification in rural areas are likely to result in an underestimation or overestimation of the total COPD deaths in China.",

The limited available Asian data indicate that morbidity due to COPD increases with age and is considerably greater in men than women, 11, 14, 15 in contrast to the narrower gender gap in most Western countries, 7, 10 and the reversal of the gender ratio in the United States where female rates have exceeded male rates. 6 Acute triggers associated with hospitalization for COPD in Asian countries include environmental factors such as acute rise in air pollution 14 and influenza infection. 16 In Asia, hospitalization is the single largest item in the direct health-care cost for COPD (Table 2) . 15 The associated risk factors for frequent hospital admissions for acute exacerbations of COPD are disease severity and psychosocial distress. 17 In particular, comorbid depressive symptoms in COPD patients are associated with poorer survival, longer hospital stay, persistent smoking, increased symptom burden, and poorer physical and social functioning. 18 Comprehensive hospitalization records are not widely available. Hospitalizations for COPD are increasing in most Asian countries. 11, 14, 15 In some Asian countries such as Singapore, even as the trend for mortality rates fell, hospitalization rates continued to rise. This dichotomy in trends is most likely the result of a sustained decline in the cigarette-smoking epidemic due to wellestablished antismoking measures, but it also indicates that the disease burden would continue for some time beyond the peak and the decline of the associated risk factors. 11, 15 Prevalence The WHO estimates that the world prevalence of COPD is 340 million, 1 with world prevalence rate in 2001 of 1.01% in all age groups, thus underestimating the prevalence in adults and elderly. Accurate estimates of prevalence in most countries are unknown, as there have been few published population-based studies on the prevalence of COPD worldwide, especially in developing countries, including most of Asia. Even in countries where data are available, published prevalence rates vary appreciably across countries, due to different methods and criteria for detecting COPD in the community, such as symptoms of chronic bronchitis, physician-diagnosed COPD, or spirometric airflow limitation 19 (Table 3 6,10,20 -23,25,26,28 -30,32,33 ).",

Population-based studies are rare, because of limitations in resources, the complexity of organization, and the unavailability of lung function equipment. Yet, there is a need for local data on prevalence to provide some insight into the extent of the burden of COPD to facilitate disease awareness and health-care planning. According to the WHO estimates, 27 the number of COPD cases in Asia exceeds by three times the total number of COPD cases for the rest of the world. In a symptom-based study 28 in Nepal, the crude prevalence in a rural community was 18% based on symptoms of chronic bronchitis. A study 29 of elderly Chinese living in Hong Kong found a prevalence of 6.8% for all severity based on spirometry findings. In a large population-based, multicentric study 30 in India, the prevalence of chronic bronchitis was found to be 4.1% in adults \u0546 35 years of age, with a male/female ratio of 1.56 and a smoker/nonsmoker prevalence ratio of 2.65 ( Table 3) . The Asia Pacific Round Table group, 31 consisting of a panel of regional respiratory experts, used a statistical model with a standardized protocol to project and compare the prevalence of moderate-tosevere COPD in 12 Asian countries or cities. The projected prevalence rates range from 3.5% for Hong Kong and Singapore to 6.7% in Vietnam, with an overall prevalence rate of 6.3% for the region, which is considerably higher than that estimated by the WHO for the region (3.8%) [ Table 4 ].",

In a population-based study 32 conducted in Japan in 2001, the prevalence of airflow limitation was 10.9% for adults \u0546 40 years of age, rising with age to 24% in those persons \u03fe 70 years of age, which are rates that are several times larger than the previously accepted COPD prevalence rate of 1.7%. 15 Airflow limitation was significantly more prevalent in men than women (16.4% vs 5.0%, respectively). The prevalence in smokers was 17.1% in men and 7.5% in women, while that in nonsmokers was 5.8%. The authors also found a high degree of underrecognition of COPD, as 90% of patients with airflow limitation did not have a previous diagnosis of COPD. In Korea, the prevalence of COPD based on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 3 criteria (ie, FEV 1 /FVC ratio of \u03fd 0.7) was 17.2% among subjects \u03fe 45 years of age. Airflow limitation was more prevalent in men (25.8%) than in women (9.6%). Among adults of all ages (ie, those \u0546 18 years of age), the prevalence of airflow obstruction was 7.8% (men, 10.9%; women, 4.9%). The majority of these cases were found to be mild in degree, and only a minority of these subjects had received physician diagnosis or treatment. These conclusions reflect those found in Japan 32 and in the West. 26 As more epidemiologic studies in the world become available using a standardized methodology, such as that in the multisite Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease initiative, 19 standardized comparison of COPD burden between cities and regions may be feasible in the near future. 25 Overall, the existing data support the concept that COPD is a common worldwide disease in countries of Asia and the West. The similarities between East and West are that COPD is a disease of older individuals, is linked to the local smoking prevalence, and the trend is of rising mortality and morbidity. The differences are in the size of the disease burden between genders and in the trend rate, which is largely related to the \"maturity\" of the cigarettesmoking epidemic and the population demographics, compounded by other risk factors such as indoor air pollution from biomass fuel combustion and poorer socioeconomic circumstances.",

Studies have demonstrated an increased risk of COPD within families with COPD probands. Some of this risk may be due to shared environmental factors, but several studies 34, 35 in diverse populations have also suggested a shared genetic risk. To date, \u2423 1 -antitrypsin (\u2423 1 -AT) deficiency, a major circulating serine protease inhibitor, is the only genetic factor that is definitely linked to the development of emphysema or COPD, independent of tobacco expo-sure. Affected individuals have a 40-fold increase in the risk of the development of COPD compared to unaffected people. This rare hereditary deficiency is a recessive trait most commonly seen in individuals of Northern European origin and is extremely rare among Asians. Limited data have failed to link COPD with \u2423 1 -AT deficiency in Chinese either by determining the levels in the serum 36 or by genotyping and electrophoretic phenotyping for cases of PiZ and PiS. 37, 38 Although variants of \u2423 1 -AT deficiency have been reported such as variant Siiyama in Japan, 39 and METokyo an Mpirare among Chinese, they have not been linked to COPD. 38 A number of candidate genes in whites have been implicated in an increased risk for COPD, including ABH nonsecretor status, 40 microsomal epoxide hydrolase level, 41 glutathione S-transferase level, 42 \u2423 1antichymotrypsin level, 43 the complement component GcG level, 44 cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 level, 45 and microsatellite instability. 46 The results are often inconsistent but could be related to the potential pathogenic mechanisms of COPD. In Asians, studies on putative candidate genes found in whites have not yielded consistent results in Chinese, 47, 48 Thais, 49 Koreans, 50 or Japanese. 51 ",

            "text": "Tobacco Smoking: Cigarette smoking is the main risk factor and the main method by which tobacco exposure is involved in the development of COPD, a fact that has been well established by pivotal crosssectional and longitudinal studies. 52-54 Cigarette smokers have a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, a greater annual rate of decline in FEV 1 , and a greater COPD mortality rate than nonsmokers. 55 In susceptible smokers, the decline in lung function is twice that in nonsmokers, though what determines this susceptibility remains unknown. The respiratory abnormalities increase in proportion to the number of cigarettes smoked. 56, 57 Pipe and cigar smokers also have greater COPD morbidity and mortality rates than nonsmokers, but their rates are lower than those for cigarette smokers. 55 Passive exposure to cigarette smoke (also known as environmental tobacco smoke) may also contribute to chronic respiratory symptoms and COPD by increasing the burden of inhaled particles and gases. 3 Environmental tobacco smoke exposure is increasingly recognized in Asia as an important risk factor for COPD in nonsmokers. 30 Additional types of tobacco smoking such as bidi and hookah (ie, water pipes), which are popular in various Asian countries, are also risk factors for COPD. Bidi are small brown cigarettes, often flavored, consisting of tobacco hand-rolled in tendu or temburni leaf and secured with a string at one end; they are the preferred means of smoking in subcontinent India, especially in the rural areas. Although the risk of smoking bidis relative to smoking cigarettes has not been fully studied, existing data suggest that bidis are at least as harmful as cigarettes. The population prevalences of chronic bronchitis were 8.2% in bidi users compared with 5.9% in cigarette users in adults \u03fe 35 years of age. 58 In one cohort study 59 of tobacco users in Mumbai, India, the relative risks of all-cause mortality were 1.8 for bidi smokers compared with 1.4 for cigarette smokers. Much less is known of the extent of harmful outcomes from the hookah or water pipe, which is used to smoke tobacco in several Asian countries such as China, India, and Pakistan, and is causing global concern as it has become a fashionable or exotic form of tobacco smoking among the young in both the East and West. 60, 61 According to the WHO, there are 1.1 billion smokers worldwide, of whom 800 million are in developing countries. 1 Globally, 4.9 million deaths each year are attributed to tobacco use, and this annual toll is projected to increase to 10 million within the next 20 years. 61 The highest prevalence of smoking is found in Asia, which is experiencing a smoking epidemic at the same time as the prevalence for smoking is falling in the Western world (Fig 1) . China has the largest production and consumption of tobacco worldwide. Approximately 67% of men and 4% of women \u03fe 15 years of age in China are smokers, and the total of \u03fe 320 million Chinese smokers represents about one third of all smokers worldwide. The incidence of smoking-related diseases has yet to peak, while it is estimated that currently 1 million Chinese die annually from these diseases. 62 Smoking among teenagers is a cause for major concern, as the prevalence for many countries in Asia is among the highest in the world, with sharp increases in smoking among young women. 62, 63 It would seem inevitable that the social and economic burden of deaths and morbidity will increase exponentially in the future unless effective antismoking measures are in place to reduce the burden of smoking.",

Smoking prevalence by country and gender in Asia-Pacific countries/regions. Redrawn from data from the study of the Regional COPD Working Group. 31 animal dung for cooking and for heating in poorly ventilated homes, is an important risk factor for COPD in nonsmokers in many developing countries including Asia. 70 Depending on the type of fuel used, the ventilation and combustion duration, biomass fuel combustion generates respiratory particulates at concentrations of 1,000 to 2,000 g/m 3 , which is equivalent to 10 to 50 times the pollution in heavy urban traffic. 71 The association between biomass fuel combustion as a risk factor in the development of COPD in nonsmoking women has been well documented in India, 70 China, 72 and Mexico, 73 but rarely occurs in the West, according to a report from Barcelona, Spain. 74 Outdoor Air Pollution: Ambient air pollution is a long-term problem in many Asian countries, which are undergoing rapid industrialization and urbanization. Over the past 2 decades, air pollution in most cities in developed countries has decreased appreciably, but air pollution has increased markedly in many cities in developing countries. Although it is not clear which specific elements of ambient air pollution are harmful, an acute increase in air pollution has been associated with increased numbers of deaths and hospitalizations from cardiopulmonary illnesses. 75, 76 The cumulative effect of chronic air pollution and its potential multiplicative effect with cigarette smoking in the development of COPD is unclear, but heavy air pollution could add to the individual burden of inhaled particles. This is especially pertinent in Asian countries that have persistent heavy urban air pollution due to traffic and industries, with recurrent acute exacerbations of air pollution due to climatic changes 77 and forest fires. 78 In the 1990s, nitrogen oxide emissions from Asia surpassed those from North America and Europe, and are projected to continue to exceed them for the coming decades. 79 Infection: The prevalence of respiratory illnesses in early childhood, pulmonary tuberculosis, and HIVpositive status are common in developing Asian countries. Early childhood respiratory illnesses and low birth weight have been associated with the development of airflow limitation. A sequela of pulmonary tuberculosis is chronic airflow limitation, but the relationship is complex as smoking itself reduces host defense and may predispose the patient to the development of tuberculosis. 3 The prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis remains high in many Asian countries and is an important additive risk factor to smoking in the development of chronic airflow limitation. The presence of HIV infection has been shown to accelerate the development of emphysema, 3 but the impact on the development of COPD in Asians is unknown.",

            "text": "In Asian countries, patients with COPD are mostly under the care of primary care physicians. Synonyms for COPD, which include chronic bronchitis and chronic emphysema, complicate the diagnostic labeling. Doctors who practice alternative/traditional medicine do not differentiate asthma from COPD, resulting in the underdiagnosis of COPD. The diagnosis is usually based on a clinical history of persistent respiratory symptoms in a cigarette smoker, as spirometric documentation of fixed airflow limitation is not routine. 14 In tertiary care practice, a spirometric determination is often included. 80 In Japan, COPD is underdiagnosed in the population, where a large epidemiologic study 32 found that 90% of people with COPD, based on spirometry findings, did not have a prior diagnosis of the condition, which is comparable to a corresponding 63% reported in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study 6 in the United States. In Japan, in a primary care setting of smokers followed up for nonrespiratory conditions, 31% were found to have COPD based on screening spirometry findings, 81 which is within the range of 14 to 46% reported in the United States. 82 Pulmonary tuberculosis is a major confounder in the diagnosis of COPD as the sequelae from healed tuberculosis include restrictive, obstructive, or mixed restrictive-obstructive pulmonary dysfunction, which could modify the interpretation of the spirometric evaluation. 3 In addition, pulmonary tuberculosis often coexists with COPD, as regions with high prevalence rates of pulmonary tuberculosis, such as Indonesia, China, and Vietnam, also experience high cigarette smoking rates. 31 Management A comprehensive description of the management of COPD in Asia is beyond the scope of this review. The focus is therefore on the management of stable patients with COPD and regional COPD guidelines. Most Asian countries either have national guidelines for the management of COPD, 83, 84 or adapt the GOLD 3 guidelines for the care of patients with COPD. 80 The Asia-Pacific COPD Roundtable group, a taskforce of representative opinion leaders in respirology in the region, has formulated a consensus statement 80 on implementation of the GOLD strategy for COPD 3 in the Asia-Pacific region. In this consensus statement, universally applicable aspects of the recommendations were emphasized, while possible difficulties in the implementation of the global guidelines were highlighted; amendments were made to ensure their relevance, applicability, and usefulness in developing countries, in different health-care settings, and in different www.chestjournal.org CHEST / 133 / 2 / FEBRUARY, 2008",

The overall burden of COPD is several-fold greater in Asia than in the West, and is mainly determined by the size of the risk factors and the phase of the tobacco epidemic in the region. Treatment aims in Asian countries are based on evidence-based management guidelines. Barriers to the implementation of disease management guidelines are related to issues of resource conflict and lack of organizational support rather than cultural differences in medical practice. There is a need for a multifaceted approach in improving the awareness of prevalence and disease burden, in facilitating the accurate diagnosis of COPD among chronic respiratory diseases, and in championing health policies that reduce the burden of the main risk factors for COPD and the wider use of evidencebased management for COPD.",
