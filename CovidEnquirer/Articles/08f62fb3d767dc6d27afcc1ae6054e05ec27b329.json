Similar to the helicase ATPase assay, neither 2 nor 3 showed inhibition of helicase duplex DNA-unwinding activity even at a concentration of 100 lM, and the inhibitory activities of 1 and 6 were only marginal (39.9 and 28.7 lM, respectively). However, three ADK analogues showed modest to potent inhibition of SCV Hel duplex DNA-unwinding activity with IC 50 values of 13.6 (4), 5.4 (7), and 11.0 lM (8), which are comparable to those of the previously reported inhibitors including bismuth complexes (3.0-11.0 lM), 8 HE602 (6.0 lM), 18 and vanillinbananin (2.7 lM). 3 It is worth to note that, unlike bismuth complexes which showed the same order of inhibition in both ATPase and duplex DNA-unwinding assay, 8 the ADK analogues showed selective inhibition against the duplex DNA-unwinding activity. Thus, it is conceivable that the ADKs might have mechanism of inhibition different from that of the bismuth complexes. Also noteworthy is that the ADK analogues are the only SCV Hel inhibitors reported to date with structure-activity relationships: the regiochemistry as well as the aromatic substituent dramatically influence the anti-SCV activ-ities of the ADKs. In particular, compounds with para-relationship between the diketoacid moiety and the OCH 2 Ar group (1 and 2) do not show antiviral activities. Also, the chlorine substituent on the terminal aromatic ring has completely different effects on the inhibitory activities of the ADKs. In comparison with 7, the inhibitory activity against the target enzyme of 8 is rarely affected by chlorination. On the contrary, chlorine substitution resulted in significant changes in antiviral activities of 4 and 6 in comparison with their unsubstituted counterparts 3 and 5. Taken together, this result suggests a possible specific binding site for the ADKs in the SCV Hel, which warrants further investigation of more structurally diverse ADK analogues on their anti-SCV activities to provide definitive structure-activity relationships as well as the possible binding site.",

Absorbance at 620 nm was measured and the amount of phosphate released was quantitated using inorganic phosphate standard curve. Each experiment was repeated three times and averaged. As shown in Figure 2a and Table 1 , no ADK investigated in this study showed significant inhibition activity against the enzyme.

            "text": "The inhibition of ADK analogues against the SCV Hel duplex DNA-unwinding activity was measured by FRET-based assay as previously described 16, 17 and the results are summarized in Figure 2b and Table 1 . Similar to the helicase ATPase assay, neither 2 nor 3 showed inhibition of helicase duplex DNA-unwinding activity even at a concentration of 100 lM, and the inhibitory activities of 1 and 6 were only marginal (39.9 and 28.7 lM, respectively). However, three ADK analogues showed modest to potent inhibition of SCV Hel duplex DNA-unwinding activity with IC 50 values of 13.6 (4), 5.4 (7), and 11.0 lM (8) , which are comparable to those of the previously reported inhibitors including bismuth complexes (3.0-11.0 lM), 8 HE602 (6.0 lM), 18 and vanillinbananin (2.7 lM). 3 It is worth to note that, unlike bismuth complexes which showed the same order of inhibition in both ATPase and duplex DNA-unwinding assay, 8 the ADK analogues showed selective inhibition against the duplex DNA-unwinding activity. Thus, it is conceivable that the ADKs might have mechanism of inhibition different from that of the bismuth complexes. Also noteworthy is that the ADK analogues are the only SCV Hel inhibitors reported to date with structure-activity relationships: the regiochemistry as well as the aromatic substituent dramatically influence the anti-SCV activ-ities of the ADKs. In particular, compounds with para-relationship between the diketoacid moiety and the OCH 2 Ar group (1 and 2) do not show antiviral activities. Also, the chlorine substituent on the terminal aromatic ring has completely different effects on the inhibitory activities of the ADKs. In comparison with 7, the inhibitory activity against the target enzyme of 8 is rarely affected by chlorination. On the contrary, chlorine substitution resulted in significant changes in antiviral activities of 4 and 6 in comparison with their unsubstituted counterparts 3 and 5. Taken together, this result suggests a possible specific binding site for the ADKs in the SCV Hel, which warrants further investigation of more structurally diverse ADK analogues on their anti-SCV activities to provide definitive structure-activity relationships as well as the possible binding site.",
