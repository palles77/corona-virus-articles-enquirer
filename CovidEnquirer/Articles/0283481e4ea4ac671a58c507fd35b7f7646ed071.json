In this study, we show that expression of the SARS-CoV E protein in mammalian cells alters the membrane permeability of these cells. Immunofluorescent staining and cell fractionation studies demonstrate that this protein is an integral membrane protein. It is mainly localized to the ER and the Golgi apparatus. The protein can be translocated to the cell surface and is partially associated with lipid rafts. Further biochemical characterization of the protein reveals that it is posttranslationally modified by palmitoylation on all three cysteine residues. Systematic mutagenesis studies confirm that the membrane permeabilizing activity of the SARS-CoV E protein is associated with its transmembrane domain.",

            "text": "A group of small, highly hydrophobic viral proteins, termed viroporin, has been identified in diverse viral systems. These include the HCV p7 protein (Pavlovic et al., 2003) , human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1) Vpu (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 1998; Schubert et al., 1996) , influenza A virus M2 (Pinto et al., 1992) , hepatitis A virus 2B (Jecht et al., 1998) , semliki forest virus 6K (Sanz et al., 1994) , picornavirus 2B (Agirre et al., 2002; Aldabe et al., 1996) , chlorella virus PBCV-1 Kcv (Mehmel et al., 2003) , and avian reovirus p10 protein (Bodelon et al., 2002) . These proteins contain at least one transmembrane domain that interacts with and expands the lipid bilayer. The transmembrane domain could form hydrophilic pores in the membrane by oligomerization (Carrasco et al., 1995; Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003) . The hydrophilic channels would allow low molecular weight hydrophilic molecules to across the membrane barrier, leading to the disruption of membrane potential, collapse of ionic gradients, and release of essential compounds from the cell. Alterations in ion concentration would promote translation of viral versus cellular mRNAs, as translation of mRNAs from many cytolytic animal viruses is fairly resistant to high sodium concentrations Virology 349 (2006) 364 -275 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro (Carrasco et al., 1995; Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003) . Progressive membrane damage during viral replication cycles would also result in cell lysis, promote viral budding and release, and facilitate virus spread to surrounding cells. Therefore, disruption of the function of viroporins could abrogate viral infectivity, rendering these proteins as suitable targets for the development of antiviral drugs. Coronavirus E protein is a minor structural protein (Liu and Inglis, 1991; Yu et al., 1994) . It plays essential roles in virion assembly, budding, morphogenesis, and regulation of other cellular functions Machamer, 2001, 2002; Fischer et al., 1998; Lim and Liu, 2001) . In a recent study, we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV E protein could obviously enhance the membrane permeability of bacterial cells to onitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside and hygromycin B, suggesting that the protein may function as a viroporin (Liao et al., 2004) . Similar observations were recently reported on mouse hepatitis virus E protein (Madan et al., 2005) . In a separate study, the transmembrane domain of the protein was indeed shown to be able to form a cation channel on artificial membrane (Wilson et al., 2004) . Molecular simulation and in vitro oligomerization studies indicate that this domain could form stable pentamers (Torres et al., 2005) . In this study, we show that the expression of SARS-CoV E protein alters membrane permeability of mammalian cells. This membrane permeabilizing activity is associated with the transmembrane domain. Unlike in bacterial cells, mutations of the three cysteine residues alone do not obviously affect the membrane permeabilizing activity of the protein. Further biochemical characterization of the E protein shows that it is an integral membrane protein, and is posttranslationally modified by palmitoylation on all three cysteine residues.",

At 12 h posttransfection, cells were treated with two different concentrations of hygromycin B for 30 min, and then radiolabeled with [ 35 S] methionine-cysteine for 3 h. Cell extracts were prepared and the expression of E protein was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody under mild washing conditions. As shown in Fig. 1 , extracts prepared from cells without treatment with hygromycin B showed the detection of the E protein and some other cellular proteins. In cells treated with 1 and 2 mM of hygromycin B, the expression of the E protein was reduced to 6 and 2%, respectively (Fig. 1) . However, in cells transfected with the SARS-CoV N protein, a similar amount of the N protein was detected in cells both treated and untreated with hygromycin B (Fig. 1) . The expression of the N protein was marginally reduced to 90 and 85%, respectively (Fig. 1) . These results confirm that expression of E protein in mammalian cells alters the membrane permeability of these cells to hygromycin B.",

These residues are located 3-7 amino acids downstream of the C-terminal residue of the transmembrane domain (Fig. 2) . The first and third cysteine residues, at amino acid positions 40 and 44, respectively, were previously shown to play certain roles in oligomerization of the E protein (Liao et al., 2004) . They may also be involved in the E protein-induced alteration of membrane permeability in bacterial cells (Liao et al., 2004) . To systematically test the effects of these residues on the expression, posttranslational modification, folding, oligomerization, and the membrane-permeabilizing activities of E protein, seven mutants, C40-A, C43-A, C44-A, C40/44-A, C40/43-A, C43/44-A, and C40/43/44-A, with mutations of the three cysteine residues to alanine either individually or in combination of two or three, were made by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 2) . Western blotting analysis of cells expressing wild type and most mutant constructs showed specific detection of three species migrating at the range of molecular masses from 14 to 18 kDa under reducing conditions and representing three isoforms of the E protein (Fig. 3a) . These isoforms may be derived from posttranslational modification of the protein. The apparent molecular masses of these isoforms on SDS-PAGE are significantly larger than the calculated molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa for the Flag-tagged E protein.",

            "text": "These results suggest that, contrary to the previous results observed in bacterial cells, these cysteine residues do not render significant effects on the membrane permeabilizing activity of the E protein. The reason for this discrepancy is uncertain, but it may reflect differences in posttranslational modifications, membrane association, subcellular localization, and translocation of the E protein in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. HeLa cells expressing the Flag-tagged wild type E (lanes 1, 2, and 3) and seven cysteine to alanine mutation constructs (lanes 4-24) were treated with 0, 0.5, and 1 mM of hygromycin B for 30 min at 12 h posttransfection, and radiolabeled with [ 35 S] methionine-cysteine for 3 h. Cell lysates were prepared and the expression of E protein was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody under mild washing conditions. SARS-CoV N protein was coexpressed with wild type and mutant E protein, and the expression of N protein was detected by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-N antibodies. Polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The percentages of E and N proteins detected in the presence of hygromycin B were determined by densitometry and indicated at the bottom. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kilodaltons. Effects of mutations introduced into the transmembrane domain on the membrane permeabilizing activity of the SARS-CoV E protein SARS-CoV E protein contains an unusually long putative transmembrane domain of 29 amino acid residues with a high leucine/isoleucine/valine content (55.17%) (Arbely et al., 2004) . Recent molecular simulation and biochemical evidence showed that this domain may be involved in the formation of ion channel by oligomerization (Torres et al., 2005) . Mutations of the putative transmembrane domain were therefore carried out to study its functions in membrane association and permeabilizing activity of the E protein. As shown in Fig. 2 , four mutants, Em1, Em2, Em3, and Em4, were initially made by mutation of 3-7 leucine/valine residues to charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain. Two more mutants, Em5 and Em6, were subsequently made. Em5, which contains mutation of N15 to E, was constructed based on the molecular simulation studies showing that this residue may be essential for oligomerization of the protein ( Fig. 2 ) (Torres et al., 2005) . Em6 was made by combination of the Em4 and C40/43/44-A ( Fig.  2 ). Expression of these mutants showed the detection of polypeptides with apparent molecular masses ranging from 10 to 18 kDa (Fig. 4a) . Interestingly, mutations introduced into Em2, Em3, EM4, and Em6 significantly change the migration rate of the corresponding mutant E protein on SDS-PAGE. The apparent molecular mass of these mutants is approximately 10 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted molecular weight for the Flag-tagged E protein (Fig. 4a ). The fact that substitutions of the hydrophobic amino acid residues in the transmembrane domain of the E protein with charged amino acids significantly alter the migrating properties of the E protein in SDS-PAGE may reflect the changes in overall conformation and membrane association of these mutants compared to wild type E protein.",

To determine the oligomerization status of the SARS-CoV E protein, the E protein with a His-tag at the C-terminus was expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system and purified by Ni-NTA purification system. The purified E protein was concentrated and subjected to crosslinking with three different concentrations of glutaraldehyde, a short self-polymerizing reagent that reacts with lysine, tyrosine, histidine, and tryptophan. Cross-linking with glutaraldehyde showed the detection of dimer, trimer, tetramer, pentamer, and other higher-order oligomers/aggregates of the E protein under either non-reducing (Fig. 6 , lanes 1-3) or reducing (Fig. 6 , lanes 4-6) conditions. It was noted that more higher-order oligomers/aggregates were detected under nonreducing conditions when higher concentrations of the crosslinking reagent were used (Fig. 6, lanes 1-3) . These results indicate that both interchain disulfide bond formation and hydrophobic interaction are contributing to the oligomerization of the E protein. More detailed characterization of the oligomerization status of the SARS-CoV E protein was hampered by the low expression efficiency of the protein in the system.",

Fig. 6 . Oligomerization of SARS-CoV E protein. The His-tagged E protein expressed in Sf9 insect cells was purified using Ni-NTA purification system (Qiagen), and incubated with three different concentrations of glutaraldehyde (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mM) for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by adding 100 mM glycine. Polypeptides were separated on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel in the presence or absence of 1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and analyzed by Western blot with anti-His antibody. Different oligomers of the E protein are indicated on the right. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kilodaltons. (11, 43) . To verify if SARS-CoV E protein is palmitoylated, two independent experiments were performed. First, treatment of the E protein with 1M hydroxylamine showed the reduced detection of the more slowly migrating isoforms (Fig. 7a, lanes 1 and 2) . As a control, treatment of the IBV E protein with the same reagent abolished the detection of upper bands (Fig. 7a, lanes 3 and 4) . Second, the three cysteine residues in combinations of two or all three were mutated to alanine (Fig. 2) . Wild type and mutant E proteins were then expressed in HeLa cells and labeled with [ 3 H] palmitic acid or [ 35 S] methionine-cysteine. As shown in Fig. 7b , wild type and all mutant E proteins were efficiently labeled with [ 35 S] methionine-cysteine (Fig. 7b, upper  panel) . In cells labeled with [ 3 H] palmitate, wild type and the three mutants with mutations of different combinations of two cysteine residues (C40/44-A, C40/43-A and C43/44-A) were efficiently detected (Fig. 7b, lower panel, lanes 1-4) . However, the construct with mutation of all three cysteine residues (C40/43/44-A) was not labeled (Fig. 7b , lower panel, lane 5). As a positive control, the IBV E protein was also efficiently labeled by [ 3 H] palmitate (Fig.  7b, lower panel, lane 6) . These results confirm that SARS-CoV E protein is modified by palmitoylation at all three cysteine residues.",

Although clear ER localization of the coronavirus IBV E protein was observed at early time points in a time course experiment using an overexpression system (Lim and Liu, 2001) , no such localization patterns were observed as reported by Corse and Machamer (2003) . To clarify that the above observed ER localization pattern may be due to the high expression level of the protein in HeLa cells using the vaccinia/T7 system, the subcellular localization of the SARS-CoV E protein in another cell type with lower expression efficiency of the protein was carried out. As shown in Fig. 8a , expression of the Flag-tagged SARS-CoV in BHK cells stably expressing the T7 RNA polymerase (Buchholz et al., 1999) showed that the protein exhibits typical Golgi localization patterns (panels D-F). Expression of the untagged SARS-CoV E protein in the same cell type also shows very similar Golgi localization patterns as the Flag-tagged protein (Fig. 8a , panels G-I). These results suggest that the predominant ER localization patterns in HeLa cells observed above may be due to the cell type used and the very high expression levels of the protein in individual cells with the vaccinia/T7 expression system.",

In a previous study, the SARS-CoV E protein was shown to obviously enhance the membrane permeability of bacterial cells to onitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside and hygromycin B (Liao et al., 2004) . In this study, we show that this protein can also alter membrane permeability of mammalian cells to the general translation inhibitor, hygromycin B. Evidence present further demonstrates that the SARS-CoV E protein is an integral membrane protein, and its membrane-permeabilizing activity is associated with the transmembrane domain. The SARS-CoV E protein contains a putative long transmembrane domain of 29 amino acid residues (Arbely et al., 2004) . In a recent report, Arbely et al. (2004) showed that the protein might have a highly unusual topology, consisting of a short transmembrane helical hairpin that forms an inversion about a previously unidentified pseudo-center of symmetry. This hairpin structure could deform lipid bilayers and cause tabulation (Arbely et al., 2004) . The full-length and N-terminal 40 amino acid region were shown to be able to form cationselective ion channels on artificial lipid bilayers (Wilson et al., 2004) . By using molecular simulation and synthetic peptide approaches, it was shown that the transmembrane domain of E protein could form ion channels by homooligomerization into stable dimers, trimers, and pentamers (Torres et al., 2005) . The mutagenesis data present in this study showed that introduction of radical mutations to the transmembrane domain is required to block the membrane-permeabilizing activity of the protein. Mutations introduced into the transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV E protein in Em2 as well as in Em3 and Em4 drastically change the migration properties of the E protein in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4a) . It suggests that these mutations would have significantly altered the overall folding, hydrophobicity, and membrane association properties of the E protein. However, this mutant shows very similar properties in subcellular localization, membrane association, and membrane-permeabilizing activity as wild type E protein. The high tolerance of E protein to such dramatic mutations indicates that maintenance of these properties would be essential for the functionality of E protein in coronavirus life cycles. This possibility would warrant more systematic studies by using an infectious clone system.",

The E protein of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus and IBV was also reported to be palmitoylated (Corse and Machamer, 2001) . It has been noted that palmitoylation of viral envelope proteins usually takes place on cysteine residues located within the transmembrane domain or in the cytoplasmic tail close to this domain (Bhattacharya et al., 2004; Hausmann et al., 1998; Schmidt et al., 1988; Veit et al., 1989) . This thioester linkage of fatty acids to viral envelope proteins is a posttranslational event that takes place in the cis or medial Golgi after exit from the ER and after oligomerization but prior to acquisition of endo H (endo-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase H) resistance (Bonatti et al., 1989; Veit and Schmidt, 1993) . Palmitoylation of viral proteins plays a considerable role in virus infectivity, virion assembly, and release. For example, palmitoylation of the HA protein of influenza virus enhances its association with lipid rafts (Melkonian et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2000) ; palmitoylation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is critical for viral infectivity (Rousso et al., 2000) ; palmitoylation of the murine leukemia virus envelope protein is critical for its association with lipid rafts and cell surface expression (Li et al., 2002) ; palmitoylation of the Rous sarcoma virus transmembrane glycoprotein is required for protein stability and virus infectivity (Ochsenbauer-Jambor et al., 2001) . The observed palmitoylation of the SARS-CoV E protein may play certain roles in its cell surface expression and association with lipid rafts.",

This may reflect the relatively low sensitivity of the hygromycin B assays used to detect the membrane-permeabilizing activity of the protein. Alternatively, it suggests that the palmitoylated mutant E protein may be still tightly associated with cellular membrane, as palmitoylation of the protein would help target the protein to the cellular membrane. This membrane association could, in turn, cause membrane damage, leading to the increased membrane permeability to hygromycin B. Subcellular fractionation and biochemical characterization studies demonstrated that, similar to the IBV E protein, the SARS-CoV E protein behaves as an integral membrane protein. However, it was consistently observed that, under the experimental conditions used, certain proportions of both SARS-CoV and IBV E proteins associated with cellular membranes were resistant to 1% Triton X-100, while some of the membrane-associated proteins can be released from the membrane pellets by treatment with high pH. Two possibilities are considered. First, as observed in this study, SARS-CoV E protein is partially associated with lipid rafts. This may render the protein resistant to the treatment by Triton X-100. Second, immunofluorescent staining of cells expressing the E protein showed the detection of the protein with punctated staining patterns at both cell surface and intracellular structures. It would suggest that the protein may form aggregates. These aggregates Fig. 9 . Association of SARS-CoV E protein with lipid rafts.
