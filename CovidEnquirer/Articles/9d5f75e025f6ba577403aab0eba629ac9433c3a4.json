In a recent publication we described an in vitro correlate to this in uiuo model (Lucas et al., 1977) , involving a rat Schwannoma RN2-2 cell line, which functions as a discriminating host for the JHM virus. JHM readily established a persistent infection in RN2-2 cells during which there occurred cyclical variations in the titer of virus released into the medium and selflimiting syncytiogenesis.

It remained possible that this type of host regulation might be a species-related characteristic, although this seemed unlikely in view of the inability of either virus to replicate in the C6 rat astrocytoma. To further investigate species-related control of infectiousness, monolayers of rat HTC hepatoma and L6 myoblast cells were inoculated with JHM and MHVa. Both corona agents elicited the characteristic CPE within 2 days postinfection. The syncytiogenesis was limited, never resulting in the complete destruction of the monolayers, despite the continuous elaboration of PFU in cyclical waves (Figs. 1E and F). Throughout the period of the experiments, the fraction of cells scored as infectious centers fluctuated between 0.7 and 22.4% in the case of HTC infected with JHM, and between 3 and 45% for the MHVz infection. The infectious centers with L6 cells remained relatively constant between 6.3 and 11.5% when JHM was the infecting agent and between 14 and 30% if inoculated with MHV3. From this it becomes apparent that the capacity for discriminating between JHM and MHV3 is an unique property of RN2-2 Schwannoma cells and is not species-related. These data also show that establishment of persistence by JHM and MHVS is not exclusive to neural cells but may also occur readily in cells originating from a hepatoma and in myoblasts.",

To study this, we utilized persistent infections of RN2-2 cells by the JHM or the Ha116 viruses.

Then such cultures were returned to 32.5\", and the medium was changed and assayed daily for PFU per milliliter. With the JHM infection, if cultures were kept at 39.5' for up to 6 days, virus production recovered in most cases in 2 to 3 days following shift-down to 32.5\".
