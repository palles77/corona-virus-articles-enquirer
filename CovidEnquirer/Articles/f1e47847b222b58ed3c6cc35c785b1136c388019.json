            "text": "Recent studies in mice have demonstrated that the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 is a crucial negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, TLR signaling, and inflammatory gene expression. Furthermore, mice genetically lacking SHP-1 (me/me) display a profound susceptibility to inflammatory CNS demyelination relative to wild type mice. In particular, SHP-1 deficiency may act predominantly in inflammatory macrophages to increase CNS demyelination as SHP-1-deficient macrophages display co-expression of inflammatory effector molecules and increased demyelinating activity in me/me mice. Recently, we reported that PBMCs of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have a deficiency in SHP-1 expression relative to normal control subjects indicating that SHP-1 deficiency may play a similar role in MS as to that seen in mice. Therefore, it became essential to examine the specific expression and function of SHP-1 in macrophages from MS patients. Herein, we document that macrophages of MS patients have deficient SHP-1 protein and mRNA expression relative to those of normal control subjects. To examine functional consequences of the lower SHP-1, the activation of STAT6, STAT1, and NF-\u03baB was quantified and macrophages of MS patients showed increased activation of these transcription factors. In accordance with this observation, several STAT6-, STAT1-, and NF-\u03baB-responsive genes that mediate inflammatory demyelination were increased in macrophages of MS patients following cytokine and TLR agonist stimulation. Supporting a direct role of SHP-1 deficiency in altered macrophage function, experimental depletion of SHP-1 in normal subject macrophages resulted in an increased STAT/NF-\u03baB activation and increased inflammatory gene expression to levels seen in macrophages of MS patients. In conclusion, macrophages of MS patients display a deficiency of SHP-1 expression, heightened activation of STAT6, STAT1, and NF-\u03baB and a corresponding inflammatory profile that may be important in controlling macrophage-mediated demyelination in MS.",

            "text": "These findings have stimulated intense interest on the various effector functions of macrophages in lesion formation including signaling events that draw these cells into the CNS white matter and trigger the effector mechanisms by which these cells destroy myelin. For instance, macrophages have been identified as the major responders to CNS chemokines, producers of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and toxic molecules known to promote demyelination (7, (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , and the major cells involved in phagocytosis/degradation of myelin sheathes. Interestingly, both leukocytes and CNS plaques of MS patients contain activated transcription factors like NF-\u03baB (19, 20) , STAT1 (20) (21) (22) and STAT6 (23) (24) (25) , which can lead to enhanced expression of these inflammatory effector functions in macrophages. Based on our previous work, we propose that modulation of inflammatory signaling via these multiple transcriptional pathways may be deficient in leukocytes, including inflammatory macrophages of MS patients, and that this deficiency is responsible for susceptibility to inflammatory demyelinating processes within the CNS. SHP-1 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains which acts as a negative regulator of both innate and acquired immune cytokine signaling via NF-\u03baB (26) (27) (28) , STAT1 (29, 30) , and STAT6 (31) (32) (33) (34) . Mice genetically lacking SHP-1 (motheaten mice) display myelin deficiency, which may be mediated by increased innate inflammatory mediators in the CNS (35, 36). Furthermore, motheaten mice are highly susceptible to experimentally induced demyelinating disease (37-39). Taken together, these studies indicate that SHP-1 is a key regulator of inflammation in the CNS that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of MS. Indeed, others and we reported that SHP-1 expression and function is deficient in leukocytes of MS patients compared to normal human subjects (22, 25) .",

Recently we have shown that SHP-1deficient mice show a profound and predominant infiltration of blood-derived macrophages into the CNS following TMEV infection and that these macrophages are concentrated to areas of demyelination (9) . Importantly, these macrophages possessed an inflammatory profile in vivo with an unusual co-activation of STAT6, STAT1, and NF-\u03baB and corresponding responsive pro-inflammatory genes. Because of the rapidity of demyelination in this model, we proposed that SHP-1-deficient macrophages possess a particularly pronounced demyelinating phenotype. Accordingly, macrophage/monocyte depletion with clodronate liposomes resulted in a significant delay in the onset of clinical symptoms and decreased inflammation and demyelination in the spinal cords of SHP-1-deficient mice. Those studies suggested that SHP-1 is an important regulator of CNS inflammatory demyelination acting predominantly to control recruitment of macrophages into the CNS and a broad modulation of macrophage inflammatory effector functions.",

The present study demonstrates that the expression of SHP-1 is deficient in macrophages of MS patients compared to normal subjects. Corresponding with this deficiency, we show that phosphorylation of STAT6 and STAT1 and activation of NF-\u03baB are higher in macrophages of MS patients compared to those of normal subjects. In accordance with this activation, several STAT6-, STAT1-, and NF-\u03baB-responsive genes that are important for inflammatory demyelination were increased in macrophages of MS patients following cytokine stimulation. Supporting a direct role of SHP-1 deficiency in altered macrophage function, experimental depletion of SHP-1 in macrophages of normal human subjects using siRNA resulted in an increased activation of the above transcription factors and increased inflammatory gene expression to levels seen in macrophages of MS patients. Taken together, we propose the potential involvement of SHP-1 in mediating the augmented inflammatory profile in macrophages seen in MS patients and contributing to the pathogenesis of MS.",

In this study, macrophage cultures were obtained from 27 patients with relapsing remitting (RR) MS (mean EDSS score of 3.6+1.6) and 24 normal control subjects. The patients and control normal subjects were matched in both age and gender, and the biometric data of the subjects used in this study are shown in Table 1 . The Institutional Review Board of SUNY Upstate University approved all studies and both patients and control subjects granted informed consent before providing blood. separation medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA). After centrifugation, the 10 ml of the interface containing the PBMCs was collected and washed twice with HBSS. Adherent monocytes were cultured for a week in RPMI media, 15% fetal bovine serum, and 50ng/mL GM-CSF as previously described (41, 42). Medium was replenished every 3 days and non-adherent cells were removed at the second feeding (at 6 days). For experiments, cells were cultured for an additional day in the absence of GM-CSF, washed twice with PBS and adherent cells were lysed in STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) for RNA analysis or RIPA buffer (43) for protein analysis. For flow cytometry cells were detached by incubated them in 5.0mM EDTA for 10 minutes at 37 degrees C.

Importantly, macrophages of SHP-1 deficient mice display increased levels of CCR2 (51, 52). Macrophages of MS patients had significantly higher levels of CCR2 compared to normal subjects indicating that MS-derived macrophages have a relatively heightened inflammatory state. As such, we characterized two other potential activation markers on these cells. We analyzed the antigenic determinants of CD11b (\u03b1 M \u03b2 2 integrin) and VLA4 (\u03b1 4 \u03b2 1 integrin), which have been shown to be important in the trafficking, adhesion, phagocytosis, and migration of macrophages at inflammatory sites (53) (54) (55) (56) .

Thus, SHP-1 modulates STAT activation, translocation into the nucleus, and transcriptional activity on responsive genes. Because several studies showed that SHP-1 stringently modulates IL-4R\u03b1/STAT6 signaling molecules (31, 32, 34, 57) , and STAT6 was shown to be elevated in MS (23) (24) (25) , we examined STAT6 activation in macrophages from MS patients (Figure 4 ). For analysis, we measured the level of total STAT6 (unphosphorylated plus phosphorylated) and tyrosine phosphorylated STAT6 (pSTAT6) in macrophages using intracellular flow cytometry. As expected, macrophages of MS patients had significantly elevated constitutive phosphorylation of STAT6 compared to macrophages of normal subjects ( Figure 4B ). In contrast, there were no differences in the expression levels of total STAT6 protein ( Figure 4A ), verifying that the differences observed in pSTAT6 levels are attributed to the relative phosphorylation state of STAT6. Staining the same cells for SHP-1 revealed a reciprocal expression pattern of SHP-1 and pSTAT6, such that lower constitutive levels of SHP-1 in MS patients correlated with higher pSTAT6 levels compared to macrophages of normal subjects (data 18 not shown). Furthermore, macrophages were treated for 1 hour with IL-4, which induces phosphorylation of STAT6, to determine possible differences in STAT6 activation following engagement of the IL-4 receptor. Treatment with IL-4 caused higher phosphorylation of STAT6 in macrophages of MS patients compared to normal subjects ( Figure 4B ). Similar results were obtained when macrophages were treated with IL-13, another cytokine that mediates STAT6 activation via the IL-4R\u03b1 (data not shown).",

Therefore, we characterized STAT1 activation by measuring the level of total STAT1 (unphosphorylated plus phosphorylated, STAT1) and tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) in macrophages using intracellular flow cytometry. No differences were observed in total STAT1 protein ( Figure 4C ). Constitutive pSTAT1, although higher, was not significantly elevated in macrophages of MS patients compared to normal subjects ( Figure 4D ).

Notably, NF-\u03baB activation was observed in inflammatory macrophages in MS CNS lesions (61) . Several reports have documented the negative regulation of NF-\u03baB by SHP-1 (26, 27, 59, 62, 63) . Therefore, it was important to examine NF-\u03baB activation in macrophages of MS patients ( Figure 5A ). Macrophages from normal subjects and MS patients were treated with medium alone, TNF-\u03b1 or LPS and then nuclear extracts were isolated and allowed to bind an NF-\u03baB consensus oligonucleotide sequence. Bound NF-\u03baB was then detected by a p65 (RelA)-specific antibody and quantified based on a calibration curve generated by using a purified p65 recombinant protein. Constitutively, NF-\u03baB binding was slightly, but significantly elevated in macrophages of MS patients compared to normal subjects ( Figure 5A ). Furthermore, treatment with either T N F-\u03b1 or LPS dramatically increased NF-\u03baB binding and importantly nuclear extracts from macrophages of MS patients showed significantly increased binding compared to macrophages of normal subjects.",

Furthermore, stimulation of macrophages with LPS or dsRNA resulted in a substantial induction of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in both subject groups but the induction was significantly higher in macrophages of MS patients compared to normal subjects.

The expression levels of STAT6-responsive chemokines were of particular interest because these mediate trafficking, maturation, and attraction of lymphocytes and macrophages to areas of CNS inflammation (14) . CCL17/TARC (67, 68) and CCL11/Eotaxin I (69) were substantially induced in macrophages following IL-4 treatment and importantly macrophages of MS patients showed significantly higher induction compared to macrophages of normal subjects ( Figure 6A & 6B) . Similar results were obtained when macrophages were treated with IL-13 (data not shown). Similarly, the mRNA of ADAM8, a STAT6-responsive disintegrin matrix metalloproteinase (70, 71) that may be involved in demyelination (72) , was induced at higher levels in macrophages of MS patients compared to macrophages of normal subjects following IL-4 treatment (data not shown). Taken together, in agreement with depressed SHP-1 levels, macrophages of MS patients display increased STAT6 activation and increased expression of STAT6-responsive gene expression.",

Recently characterized macrophage profiles are the classically activated (or M1 macrophages) that display increased STAT1/NF-\u03baB-responsive genes including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and alternatively activated (or M2 macrophages) that display increased STAT6-responsive genes including arginase I. Interestingly, there is usually a profound antagonism of differentiation towards either M1 or M2 macrophage activation profile such that dual expression of iNOS and arginase I is seldomly observed (85) (86) (87) (88) . Using this paradigm, we determined whether MS macrophages might be preferentially skewed toward either the M1 or M2 profile relative to those of normal subjects.",

Importantly, macrophages from MS patients showed a significantly higher iNOS mRNA expression and NO production following cytokine stimulation compared to macrophages from normal subjects. With respect to constitutive arginase I expression, we found higher levels of both arginase I protein, mRNA, and enzymatic activity in MS compared to normal subject macrophages ( Figure 6C-E) . Moreover, when macrophages were exposed to M2-inducing cytokine IL-4, MS macrophages expressed more arginase I than normal subject macrophages. These data indicated that MS macrophages may be constitutively skewed towards M2 activation profile in vitro and this skewing may be further reinforced by IL-4. Nonetheless, MS macrophages also display M1-skewedness relative to normal subject macrophage following exposure to M1-inducing cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1. The latter indicates the extreme plasticity of MS macrophages relative to normal subject macrophages and the potential importance of the cytokine milieu in determining the ultimate balance between M1 and M2 phenotype of these cells.",

SHP-1 depletion resulted in a significant increase in constitutive STAT6 phosphorylation and to a significantly higher induction of pSTAT6 in response to 1-hour treatment with IL-4 ( Figure  8B ). Similar results were obtained when macrophages were treated with IL-13, another cytokine that mediates STAT6 activation via the IL-4R\u03b1 (data not shown). In addition, although SHP-1 depletion did not result in a significant increase of constitutive STAT1 phosphorylation, IFN-\u03b3 treatment for 1 hour induced significantly higher pSTAT1 levels in SHP-1 depleted macrophages compared to control macrophages treated with scrambled siRNA ( Figure 8C ). To further validate that SHP-1 controls STAT6 and STAT1 activation, we examined the expression of STAT6-and STAT1-responsive genes in macrophages of normal subjects that were treated with either scramble siRNA or SHP-1 siRNA. The STAT6-inducible genes CCL17 ( Figure 8D ), Arginase I, CCL11, and ADAM8 (data not shown) were significantly induced to higher levels in SHP-1-depleted macrophages following an 18-hour IL-4 stimulation. Similarly, the STAT1-inducible genes IP-10 ( Figure  8E ) and caspase 1 (data not shown) were induced at significantly higher levels in SHP-1 depleted macrophages following IFN-\u03b3 treatment. Taken together, these results point to the important role of SHP-1 in down-modulating pro-inflammatory STAT6 and STAT1 activities in human macrophages.",

Macrophages can mediate myelin phagocytosis, degradation, oligodendrogliopathy, and axonal loss both through cell-mediated processes and the secretion of inflammatory mediators (1, 7, 90, 91) . Based on our recent report of increase demyelinating activity of macrophages in me/me mice (9), a key question was whether macrophages of MS patients display similar defects in modulation of proinflammatory cytokine signaling that may contribute to activated inflammatory profile and demyelinating activity. Therefore, we analyzed the expression and function of SHP-1 as a possible cause of enhanced macrophage inflammatory activity in MS. Examining monocyte-derived macrophages from MS patients and normal subjects revealed that SHP-1 was deficient in macrophages of MS patients. Interestingly, this SHP-1 deficiency corresponded to a diminished expression of SHP-1 promoter II transcripts suggesting a specific alteration in promoter II function in MS. Accordingly, macrophages from MS patients displayed enhanced STAT6, STAT1, and NF-\u03baB activity, transcription factors that were previously shown to be modulated by SHP-1 in various cell types including mouse macrophages (9) . In turn, several STAT6-, STAT1-, and NF-\u03baB-inducible genes that have been shown to play role in the mechanism of inflammatory demyelination were shown to be both higher in macrophages of MS patients and regulated by SHP-1.",

For instance, phosphorylated STAT6 was found to be highly expressed in MS lesions (24) , normal appearing white matter of MS patients (23) and leukocytes of MS patients (25) . Furthermore, macrophages of mice that lack SHP-1 show increased constitutive activation of STAT6 and heightened levels of STAT6-inducible genes (25) . Moreover, the lack of SHP-1 leads to severe macrophage-mediated CNS demyelination following TMEV infection (9, 31, 37) . Thus, the present study suggests that STAT6 activation and expression of several genes with confirmed STAT6-responsive elements in macrophages may have functional significance to the pathophysiology of MS. For example, the chemokines CCL17/TARC and CCL11/Eotaxin, which attract inflammatory cells to demyelinating lesions, were elevated in macrophages of MS patients and the expression of these chemokines is controlled by SHP-1 (92) (93) (94) .",

Proteinases may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS, since these can mediate the proteolysis of extracellular matrix molecules, disrupt the blood brain barrier, and promote leukocyte entry into the brain parenchyma (95) . ADAM8 which is highly expressed in macrophages was shown to hydrolyze myelin basic protein (72) and can therefore directly contribute to demyelination. In addition, arginase I is a STAT6-responsive gene that has been shown to be constitutively elevated in the CNS of SHP-1-deficient mice and plays an important role in virus-induced demyelinating disease (31) . Also, arginase I inhibition results in attenuation of EAE onset and progression (73) . Interestingly, the increased levels of arginase I in MS macrophages might make these cells more susceptible to viral infections relevant to MS pathogenesis (31) . Although the mechanism by which arginase I activity may promote inflammatory demyelination still remains to be elucidated, its role in MS in light of the present findings should be further investigated.",

In particular, tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 (pY-STAT1) that mediates interferon signaling was found to be elevated in MS patients and controlled by SHP-1 (20-22, 30, 58) . In agreement with those studies, we found that STAT1 activation is enhanced in macrophages of MS patients following IFN-\u03b3 stimulation. Furthermore, STAT1-inducible genes like the chemokine IP-10 and caspase 1 are elevated in macrophages of MS patients consistent with a role for STAT1 in expression of these genes (74) (75) (76) (77) (78) (79) 96) .

In addition, the inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, which are regulated by NF-\u03baB, were secreted at higher levels in macrophages of MS patients compared to macrophages of normal subjects following LPS or dsRNA stimulation which signal via TLR4 and TLR3 respectively to activate NF-\u03baB.",

            "text": "Considering that SHP-1-depleted macrophages of normal subjects display a very similar inflammatory profile to macrophages of MS patients, it is likely that the deficiency of SHP-1 seen in macrophages of MS patients is directly responsible for the increased inflammatory profile. As such, the classification of macrophage phenotypic markers may be an important consideration in MS. Several reports in mouse models point to the importance of different macrophage activation profiles in specific types of inflammatory disease (84) . For instance, so-called classically activated or M1 macrophages display increased STAT1-and NF-\u03baBresponsive genes, which have been shown to be critical for eradicating various intracellular microbes and causing some types of autoaggressive tissue inflammation such as rheumatoid arthritis. Conversely, so-called \"alternatively activated\" or M2 macrophages display increased STAT6-responsive genes including arginase I and may be more important for eradicating helminthes and promoting allergic-type inflammatory diseases. Importantly, there is usually a profound antagonism between differentiation towards either M1 or M2 macrophage activation profiles such that dual expression of M1 and M2 genes are rarely seen. In possible distinction to these prior classifications, the present study indicates that macrophages of MS patients may exhibit abnormally high activation of either STAT6, STAT1 or NF-\u03baB, depending on the nature of cytokine stimulation. As such, a deficiency in SHP-1 may allow an aberrant co-activation of STAT6/STAT1/NF-\u03baB responsive genes in MS macrophages especially in vivo where these cells may be simultaneously exposed to both M1-and M2-skewing cytokines. If so, the inflammatory nature of these macrophages may be unique and perhaps possess a corresponding enhanced demyelinating capacity.",

Adding to the promotion of broad activation phenotype of macrophages in MS are reports showing that high levels of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines are co-expressed in MS. For instance, cultured myeloid dendritic cells from RR MS patients polarize na\u00efve T-cells to both Th1 and Th2 and induce increased levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4/IL13, and TNF-\u03b1 (97, 98) .

In distinction to these prior studies, the present study exclusively employs cultured macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects, which offers the advantage of allowing stimulation of the cells with equal amounts of the cytokines IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, and TNF-\u03b1 and therefore examining intrinsic differences in cytokine signaling. Therefore, apart from the elevated cytokine levels that are observed in MS patients, this study further documents that macrophages of MS patients display enhanced signaling in response to both Th1 and Th2 pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore the lack of SHP-1 may be responsible for a broad inflammatory profile of these cells.",

            "text": "Another question that arises is how the SHP-1 deficiency observed in peripheral macrophages of MS patients might only be manifested as CNS inflammatory demyelination in MS patients. One possibility is that persistent CNS viruses might attract macrophages into the CNS and the lower levels of SHP-1 in MS macrophages enhance migration to and demyelinating activity with the CNS. The latter is supported by studies showing that TMEV infection in SHP-1-deficient mice results in severe CNS demyelination that is exclusively macrophage-mediated (108) . Furthermore, deficiency of SHP-1 in macrophages enhances responsiveness to chemokines including MCP-1 that play an important role in macrophagemediated demyelination (9, 51) . Another possibility is that macrophages are attracted into the CNS through myelin-specific autoimmune events. Once macrophages enter the CNS, the SHP-1-deficiency can contribute to enhanced Fc-gamma receptor mediated myelin phagocytosis in the presence of antibodies and complement (12, (109) (110) (111) . These hypotheses indicate a two-step process in which SHP-1-deficiency in macrophages is a precondition to tissue specific inflammation triggered by a CNS specific inflammatory signal. The latter is consistent with a recent mouse study in which SHP-1 deficiency alone does result in inflammatory disease but rather establishes a permissive state in which microbial infection triggers inflammation and autoimmunity (28) .",

            "text": "Two distinct promoters drive the expression of two different SHP-1 transcripts from the SHP-1 gene (112) (113) (114) . Here, we demonstrated that promoter II transcripts, which are preferentially expressed in hematopoetic cells, are selectively lower in macrophages of MS patients compared to normal subjects. The question thus arises as to the potential genetic basis for deficient SHP-1 promoter II activity in MS leukocytes. Several studies have examined the contribution of genetics in MS (115) (116) (117) (118) and with exception to some weak association in some populations, no study has shown an absolute linkage to the SHP-1 locus, chromosome 12p12 (119) that would explain a wide-spread deficiency in promoter II expression in MS patients. As such, alternative mechanisms need to be considered including epigenetic alterations in promoter activity. Indeed, numerous reports document the downregulation of SHP-1 promoter II transcripts in leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and attribute SHP-1 deficiency to epigenetic methylation of particular CpG sites of SHP-1 promoter II (120, 121) . Interestingly, in the context of MS, either viral infections (122) (123) (124) (125) (126) (127) or inflammation (128) (129) (130) (131) can cause de novo methylation or hypermethylate CpG promoter sequences resulting in decreased gene expression. Furthermore, a recent studies report that HTLV-1, which has been associated with the CNS demyelinating disease known as HAM/TSP (HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paparparesis) (132), profoundly and specifically suppresses SHP-1 expression through methylation of the SHP-1 promoter II (133, 134) . In accordance with these reports, preliminary data indicate that treatment of PMBCs of MS patients with the demethylating agent 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine increase SHP-1 promoter II transcripts to normal levels (personal unpublished observations). Whether a stable epigenetic modification of promoter II or another mechanism results in a deficiency in SHP-1 expression in macrophages from MS patients requires further investigation. STAT6 and STAT1 activation in macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects. Total STAT6, tyrosine phosphorylated STAT6 (pSTAT6), total STAT1, and tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) levels in macrophages of MS patients compared to normal subjects. Macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies against either against total STAT6, pSTA6, STAT1, or pSTAT1. The histogram overlays are labeled as follows: shaded histogram for isotype control, solid line for normal subject, and dashed line for MS patient. A & B. The levels of STAT6 and pSTAT6 were quantified based on the relative MFI in macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects before and after 1-hour treatment with IL-4. C & D. The levels of STAT1 and pSTAT1 were quantified based on the relative MFI in macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects before and after 1-hour treatment with IFN-\u03b3. NF-\u03baB activation in macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects. A. Macrophages from normal subjects and MS patients were treated with media alone, TNF-\u03b1 or LPS for 1 hour and nuclear extracts were isolated and allowed to bind an NF-\u03baB consensus-binding sequence. Bound NF-\u03baB was then detected by a p65 specific antibody and quantified based on a calibration curve generated by using a purified p65 recombinant protein. The NF-\u03baB DNA binding activity is reported as ng of bound p65 protein per 10\u00b5g of macrophage nuclear extracts. B. & C. TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 secretion was quantified in macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects. Macrophages were cultured in media alone or in the presence of the TLR ligands, LPS and dsRNA for 18 hours and supernatants were analyzed for TNF\u03b1 or IL-6 by ELISA. Gene profile of macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects. A number of genes that are STAT6-, STAT1-, or NF-\u03baB-inducible were quantified in macrophages of normal subjects and MS patients before and after 18-hour treatment with TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and LPS. Real time RT-PCR was used to measure the mRNA levels of CCL17/TARC, CCL11/ eotaxin, CXCL10/IP-10, Caspase I, CCL2/MCP-1, and Cyclooxygenase II (COX-2). The actual transcript copy number of each gene is reported in relation to the untreated normal subjects, which is designated as 1. Arginase I and iNOS expression and activity in macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects. A. Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression was quantified in macrophages of normal subjects and MS patients before and after 18-hour treatment with TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and LPS by real-time RT-PCR. B. Similarly, the levels of nitrite, as an indicator of Nitric Oxide (NO) production, were quantified in the supernatants of macrophages from MS patients and normal subjects that were treated with TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and LPS. C. Arginase I and actin protein expression were measured in macrophages of MS patients compared to normal subjects by Western blot analysis. D. The enzymatic activity of arginase was quantified in macrophages of MS patients and normal subjects. E. Arginase I mRNA expression was quantified in macrophages of normal subjects and MS patients before and after 18-hour treatment with TNF-\u03b1, IL-4, IFN-\u03b3, and LPS by real-time RT-PCR. SHP-1 was depleted in macrophages of normal subjects using siRNA and the inflammatory profile is the context of SHP-1 deficiency was characterized. A. Macrophages of normal subjects were treated with SHP-1 siRNA or control siRNA (scramble sequences) and the levels of SHP-1, arginase I, and actin protein levels were quantified by Western immonoblot analysis. In the same panel the amount SHP-1 and arginase protein measured by Western immunoblot were quantified by measuring the pixel density. Results were normalized to macrophages treated with scramble siRNA represented as 1. B. & C. Phosphorylated STAT6",
