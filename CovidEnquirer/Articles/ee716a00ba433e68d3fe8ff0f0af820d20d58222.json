Piglets were housed in individual stainless-steel cages and fed a mixture of pasteurized cow's milk and enriched white bread at a AM, 12 noon, and 5 PM daily. Park, Ill.). Recordings were made with the low-frequency cutoff at 5.3 Hz and the high-frequency cutoff at 100 Hz. Recordings commenced at 9 AM daily, 1 h after the morning meal and lasted for 7 h; piglets were fed in the recording box at 12 noon. Four to six preinfection (control) recordings were made from each piglet. At 8 PM on the evening of the fifth or sixth postoperative day, the piglets were infected with a l-ml oral dose (12 x 10\" plaque-forming units] of a 0.1% bacteria-free gut suspension obtained from TGE-infected piglets (OARDC pool [M-61, S-2, AB, 10117179). Postinfection recordings were continued in a similar manner to the preinfection studies, beginning at a AM the next morning and continuing for the next 3 days. Records were kept of the response to infection, specifically noting attitude, appetite, and any vomiting or diarrhea. At the end of the third day the piglets were killed by an intravenous overdose of sodium pentobarbi-tal. The small intestine was immediately removed and sections of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum were fixed for histologic examination. In addition to the control recordings in fed piglets, five or six daily recordings were made from each of 4 separate but similarly prepared piglets after an overnight fast of 17 h. In a separate study, each of these animals was also given an identical oral dose of ether inactivated viral preparation.",

For this, the number of slow waves with associated spike activity was converted to a percentage and coded to give a histogram of spike activity for each electrode and minute of recording. Phase 1 of the MMC was defined as a period 2 min or longer in which slow waves had no associated spike activity; phase 2 was defined as any period in which slow waves were associated with irregular or random spike activity.

This was propagated aborally at a velocity ranging from 5 to 20 cm/min, and recurred with a range of 4-156 min in fed and 8-102 min in fasted piglets. However, unlike the dog (6,8), periods of phase 1 activity (quiescence) that lasted from 2 to 12 min were interspersed between periods of phase 2 activity, and periods of quiescence immediately after an activity front were not a regular occurrence. In addition, all piglets exhibited a number of bursts of intense spike activity each lasting 2.5-5.0 s, which were conducted aborally at a velocity of -2 cm/s. These MAPCs (Figures 1 and 2) predominated at the end of phase 2 of the MMC immediately before an activity front, but could be identified during all phases of the cycle ( Figure  2 ). They were more prominent in the fed state (Table 1) . Differences between the overall duration (periodicity) of the MMC and the sum of its component parts (phases 1, 2, and 3 in Table 1 ) are due to the fact that more than one period of phase 1 and phase 2 activity usually occurred between successive activity fronts.",

This is supported by observations in dogs, which show that the degree of MMC disruption by feeding has a linear relationship to caloric intake (15). It must, however, be emphasized that infected piglets were only transiently inappetent, and that prolongation of phase 1 activity could not be related to changes in food intake because this was near normal on day 3 postinfection. Changes in food intake were also unrelated to disruption of MMC periodicity, to disruption of the normal propagation of the activity front, and to the progressive decrease in MAPCs that occurred postinfection.",

This implies, as was the case with the disrupted phase 3 complexes, that destruction of the small intestinal mucosa may be responsible for the decreased frequency of MAPCs. However, this interpretation probably does not apply to all situations, in that the presence of ricinoleic acid in the intestinal lumen induces an increase in the frequency of MAPC-like activity in the conscious dog (21). The net effect, whether an increase or a decrease in activity, might well depend on species differences or perhaps on the degree of mucosal damage.",
