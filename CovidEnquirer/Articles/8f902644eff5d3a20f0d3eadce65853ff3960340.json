These last observations have to be confirmed in several in vivo systems to distinguish the mechanism by which these antibodies are protective. Their use may allow the identification of the Leishntania antigens inducing effective immunity. This intensive introductory course in epidemiology is intended for physicians and other persons with a professional interest in health in tropical countries. The course will provide participants with basic skills in the epidemiological assessment of local health problems and service priorities, and in the planning of field studies. It will be conducted in English. ",
