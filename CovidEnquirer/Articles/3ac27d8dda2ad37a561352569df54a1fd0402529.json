The majority of the marine organisms are extracted fresh or frozen while the remaining specimens are lyophilized or dried in air before extraction [22] . In some instances, dried algal species are ground to a powder prior to extraction as described by Sansom and coworkers who isolated an antiproliferative bis-prenylated quinone from the alga Perithalia capillaris [23] . The extraction of marine organisms may be carried out using a range of organic solvents including hexanes, dichloromethane, acetone, ethyl acetate, as well as more polar solvents such as ethanol and methanol. In many instances, a mixture of polar and medium polarity or nonpolar solvents is utilized in the extraction protocol. For example, the extraction of the Madagascar sponge Monanchora dianchora was achieved in CH 3 Cl:MeOH (1:1) to yield two polycyclic guanidine alkaloids [24] . Extractions are usually exhaustively performed over several days with at least three aliquots of the solvent being used. The solvent is then removed in vacuo by rotary evaporation. Solvent partitioning is another strategy employed in the extraction of the organisms. This involves single one-step or two-step partitioning systems usually involving an aqueous phase portioned with a solvent immiscible with that phase. The Kupchan and modified Kupchan procedures are often employed in natural products as was described in the isolation of a diterpene from an Axinella species [25] . In this procedure, the concentration of the aqueous layer is progressively adjusted to afford three or four different fractions. Complex partitioning procedures are also employed, albeit rarely so. Simple partitioning has been most commonly employed with Kupchan schemes being utilized with less frequency [22] .",

Much like sponges and soft corals, ascidians have also been found to be a good source of bioactive agents. Didemnin B, isolated from the tunicate Trididemnum solidum, is one such bioactive compound, showing remarkable antiviral and cytotoxic activity. Didemnin B demonstrated activity against P388 and L1210 murine leukemia cell lines. It was advanced into preclinical and clinical trials 1 and 2, but had to be withdrawn due to its harsh toxicity [30] . Aplidine, formally known as dehydrodidemnin, an isolate from the Mediterranean tunicate Aplidium albicans, is one such bioactive compound. Being structurally related to didemnin B, aplidine was found to be up to 10 3 more active and less toxic than didemnin B. It entered into Phase 1 clinical trials in 1999 under investigation for the treatment of solid tumors and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Broad spectrum activity was displayed in vitro and in vivo against leukemia, melanoma, breast, ovarian, colon, and lung (nonsmall cell) cancer.

These microalgae produce compounds with a high degree of structural diversity and species, such as Lyngbya majuscula, have produced a vast array of biologically active compounds [71] . Curacin A, e.g., isolated by Gerwick and coworkers in 1994 [72] , was found to function by disturbing microtubule assembly, thereby functioning as a lead compound in chemotherapy. Microcystis aeruginosa is the source of potent protein phosphatase-1 and phosphatase-2A inhibitors identified in microcystins [73] . Other microalgal species under examination include dinoflagellates which produce an array of bioactive toxins including saxitoxin and maitotoxin which function by blocking or activating sodium/calcium channels. Challenges exist with respect to the culturing of these organisms due to relatively low proliferation rates and the large quantities of culture required to obtain small amounts of bioactive compounds.

            "text": "The supply issue, however, remains one of critical importance as it relates to the development of drugs from a marine organism. For example, (1) spongistatin 1 has been reported to be highly cytotoxic. It has been deemed to be the most active of all natural and synthetic compounds investigated by the National Institute of Cancer (USA). Three tonnes of the sponge yielded 0.8 mg of the compound. Another collection and processing of 400 kg of the sponge afforded 10 mg of the compound. This isolation work facilitated structure elucidation work. The IC 50 value for this compound was evaluated at 10 26 M in colon cancer cells and 10 212 M for breast cancer cell lines [82] . Synthetic approaches to the compound have been presented by research groups including Petit and coworkers [83, 84] .",
