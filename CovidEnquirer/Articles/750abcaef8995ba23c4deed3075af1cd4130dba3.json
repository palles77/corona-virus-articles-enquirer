Most coronaviruses, but not all, can be described as having three major unique structural protein species: a 150-200 kDa peplomeric glycoprotein (often posttranslationally proteolytically modified to two subunits of around 60-100 kDa), a 45-55 kDa internal nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and a 23-30 kDa envelope-associated, matrix-like glycoprotein (Siddell et al., 1982; Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . This description fits the well-characterized mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59 (Sturman, 1977) the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Garwes and Pocock, 1975) and the avian infectious bronchitis virus (Stern and Sefton, 1982) representatives of three of the four major coronavirus antigenic subgroups (Pedersen et al., 1978; Wege et al., 1982) . A fourth major structural protein, a 130-140 kDa glycoprotein comprised of disuifide-linked, 65 kDa subunits, is found on the hemagglutinating mammalian coronaviruses, including the hemagglutinating porcine encephalomyelitis coronavirus, the bovine enteric coronavirus, and the human coronavirus OC43, all antigenically closely related to MHV A59 (Callebaut and Pensaert, 1980; Hogue et al., 1984; Ring et al., 1982) . The 140 kDa glycoprotein is the apparent virion hemagglutinin on the bovine coronavirus (Ring et al., 1985) . We have previously reported that HCV OC43 has an analogous antigenic counterpart to each of the four major structural proteins of the bovine enteric coronavirus (Hogue et al., 1984) . In this report we describe studies that further characterize the structural proteins of HCV OC43 by showing the following. The 190 kDa protein is glycosylated and is cleavable by trypsin into subunits of 110 and 90 kDa, each of which appears to be comprised of a different amino acid sequence as determined by peptide mapping. The 130 kDa protein is a dimer of disulfide-linked glycoproteins of 65 kDa, and is the apparent virion hemagglutinin as judged from digestion studies with trypsin, bromelain and pronase. The 55 kDa protein is phosphorylated.",

These had M,s of 190000, 130000, 55000, and 26 000. The 26 000 M, protein was characteristically observed as a group of 3 or 4 closely migrating bands and the 130000 M, species behaved as a disulfide-linked dimer of 65000 M, subunits ( Fig. 1 and Hogue et al., 1984) . In some virus preparations, but not all, either one or more of three additional proteins were 3) or presence (lanes 2 and 4) of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. 32P-labeled virus was treated with RNAse (lane 5) or proteinase K (lane 6) as described in the text, and electrophoresed in the absence of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Gel acrylamide concentrations were a gradient of S-151 for lanes 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 8% for lanes 5 and 6. M, estimates were determined from measurements against radioactive protein molecular weight standards obtained from New England Nuclear Corp. (not shown). present in highly variable amounts. These were a protein of M, approx. 240000, identified as \"a\" in Figs. 1, 2, and 4, a protein of M, approx. 160~ identified as \"b\" in Figs. 1 and 4 , and a protein of h4, approx. 38000 identified as \"c\" in Figs. 2 and 4. The 240 kDa species immunoreacted with antiserum specific for gp190 (Fig.  2) suggesting it is an aggregate or possibly a native polymeric form of gp190. The 160 kDa species, present only in the absence of reducing agent, immunoreacted with antiserum specific for the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein suggesting it is an aggregate, possibly a trimer, of this molecule (Hogue et al., 1984) . The 38 kDa species reacted by immunoblotting with polyclonal antiserum specific for gp26 ( Fig. 2 and Hogue et al., 1984) , as well as with monoclonal antiserum specific for gp26 to yield an essentially identical pattern (data not shown). This protein is therefore the apparent Purified unlabeled virus (lanes 5 through 12) was incubated with trypsin at 1 mg/ml (lanes 5, 8, 10 and 12) or without trypsin (lanes 6, 7, 9, and 11) electrophoresed on a 7% polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the indicated antisera prepared against the polypeptides of the bovine coronavirus (Hogue et al., 1984) . Electrophoresis in all cases was done in the presence of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol. second rung in a ladder of multimeric forms of a self-aggregating gp26 molecule. To examine further the identity of individual protein species, bands were removed from gels and recovered proteins were analyzed by chymotryptic peptide mapping (Fig. 3) . For these studies, the amount of material in species \"a\" was insufficient to yield a map. From the data depicted in' Fig. 3 we conclude that the 190, 130 (i.e., the combined 65 kDa subunits), 55 and 26 kDa species are each unique. Furthermore, the maps of the 160 and 38 kDa species show peptides in common with the 55 and 26 kDa species respectively, thus supporting our earlier conclusions based on immunologic data that these are multimeric aggregates of discrete polypeptide species (Hogue et al., 1984) . To determine which of the polypeptides are glycosylated, virus labeled with [ 3H]glucosamine was purified and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The M,s of species with 190000, 130000 (and its reduced subunits of 65 000) and 26 000 were each glycosylated and were thus respectively designated gp190, gp130 (gp65), and gp26 (Fig. 1) . The variable M, 240000 species was also glycosylated (species a, virus was extracted with phenol, methanol precipitated, treated with RNAse to remove any contaminating RNA, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The M, 55 000 polypeptide was the only species autoradiographically observed after RNAse treatment, although its presence was completely destroyed by proteinase K treatment (Fig. l) , and it was therefore designated pp55.",

In some preparations of virus a minor reactivity was also observed with HCV OC43 proteins of 110 and 90 kDa. (These proteins electrophoretically comigrate with the 120 and 110 kDa species of the bovine coronavirus, but were assigned different M,s as a result of more rigorous measurements.) When tested against purified bovine coronavirus, this antiserum reacted with the 120 and 100 kDa proteins and also with a 190 kDa protein, a minor species (Hogue et al., 1984) . It also reacted with gp180 (E2) of the mouse hepatitis virus A59 and its subunits of J4, 90000 (Hogue et al., 1984; Sturman and Holmes, 1977) . These data together suggested a possible multimeric relationship between the HCV 0C43 gp190 and the 110 and 90 kDa proteins. We therefore tested the hypothesis that HCV OC43 gp190 is structurally analogous to the MHV E2 glycoprotein, that is, has a trypsin-sensitive cleavage site. Figure 2 , lanes 1 through 4, illustrate the conversion of gp190 to apparent subunits of 110 kDa and 90 kDa by trypsin treatment of [3H]arnino acid-labeled virus, and, in lanes 5 and 6, the confirmation of this conversion by identification with polypeptide-specific antiserum. Under the digestion conditions used, complete or nearly complete conversion to the 110 kDa and 90 kDa subunits was observed when concentrations of 20 pg trypsin per ml or higher were used (Fig. 2 and data not  shown) . The M, 240000 species \"a\" is also no longer present after trypsin treatment, and this lends further support to the notion that it is an aggregate or polymeric form of gp190.",

To examine whether the same pattern of protease sensitivity also exists for a second hemagglutinating coronavirus, purified HCV OC43, either unlabeled or 'radiolabeled with [ 3H]amino acids, was subjected to digestion with trypsin, bromelain or pronase, repurified, and examined for hemagglutinability and protein composition. Digestion of HCV OC43 with trypsin or bromelain reduced hema~lutinability by 30% and 50% on average, respectively, as dete~ned by comparing the total number of hemagglutinating units in the peak fractions with a parallel sample of untreated virus (data not shown). These are the mean values of 2 experiments for trypsin and 4 experiments for bromelain. Pronase completely destroyed hemagglutinating activity. a Determined by counting the radioactivity in 1 mm sections of a gel lane as described in the text. Electrophoresis was performed in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Data represent an average of five separate experiments and variability is shown as i one standard deviation of the mean. b Counts for the 38 kDa species are combined with those for gp26 since we conclude this species to be an aggregate of gp26.

We noted in our analysis of the bovine coronavirus (King and Brian, 1982) that the 52 kDa nucleocapsid phosphoprotein was present on the virion in equal numbers to the 26 kDa glycoprotein, and suggested from this ratio that there may be a direct molecular interaction between these species.
