Several issues are relevant to infectious disease threats during pregnancy. First, changes in immunity and physiology during pregnancy may make pregnant women more susceptible to or more severely affected by infectious diseases. Second, the effects of infectious diseases on the fetus may be unknown and difficult to predict, and diagnosis of infection in the fetus or infant can be challenging. Third, prophylaxis and treatment appropriate for the general population might not be appropriate for pregnant women. We focus on the first of these considerations: the immunology of pregnancy and the effects of emerging infectious diseases on the pregnant woman.",

Although the effects of some infectious agents during pregnancy are well known, knowledge about many others is limited. A challenge to the study of infectious diseases during pregnancy is the selection of an appropriate control group; many studies have been retrospective and without control groups. Compared with knowledge about more conventional infectious disease threats, knowledge about novel and emerging infectious diseases during pregnancy is even more limited. Such lack of knowledge causes concern, given that an altered response to infectious diseases during pregnancy may require altered responses to emerging infectious disease threats. We describe the immunologic changes that may affect the course of infectious diseases in pregnant women, briefly summarize what is known about infectious diseases during pregnancy, and then focus on the particular challenges of dealing with emerging infectious diseases in pregnant women.",

            "text": "One of the most intriguing puzzles in modern immunology involves the \"paradox of pregnancy,\" in which immunologic tolerance to paternally derived fetal antigens is achieved despite an apparently adequate maternal defense against infection. With 50% of its genetic material derived from its father, the fetus's susceptibility to rejection by the maternal immune system is similar to the susceptibility of a transplanted organ. Evidence indicates that the maternal immune system may tolerate fetal antigens by suppressing cell-mediated immunity while retaining normal humoral immunity. These changes are known to occur locally at the maternal-fetal interface but may also affect systemic immune responses to infection. Although pregnant women are not immunosuppressed in the classic sense, immunologic changes of pregnancy may induce a state of increased susceptibility to certain intracellular pathogens, including viruses, intracellular bacteria, and parasites.",

Forming a specialized epithelial surface within the placenta, fetal syncytiotrophoblast cells directly contact maternal blood for nutrient exchange. On the maternal side of the interface, the uterine tissue in contact with the placenta and fetal membranes, the decidua, is rich in specialized maternal immune cells including lymphocytes and macrophages (2) . Despite the prolonged direct exposure of decidual leukocytes and maternal blood to fetal antigens, the immune system does not recognize the fetus as foreign.

Most effective against extracellular pathogens, humoral immunity is essential for fighting many bacterial infections. The bacteria become coated in antibodies, which then mediate uptake of the pathogens by phagocytic cells, including neutrophils and macrophages. Presentation of the bacterial antigens on the surface of the macrophage then stimulates B lymphocytes specific to the pathogen, and the B cells produce more antibodies to control the infection. This humoral immune response is augmented by T-helper type II (Th2) lymphocytes, which provide costimulation and induce replication of the B cells. The Th2 response during pregnancy results in vigorous antibody-mediated immunity to pathogens (2).",

Multiple factors, including the cytokine environment and costimulatory molecules present during activation of the Thelper cell, determine the development of either Th1-or Th2-helper phenotype. One hypothesis is that, in addition to hormonal factors that affect the Th1-Th2 balance, macrophages present at the maternal-fetal interface release predominantly Th2-stimulating cytokines and contribute to the overall dominance of humoral immunity during pregnancy (3) . In addition to stimulating B lymphocytes, Th2 cells suppress the cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, decreasing the robustness of cell-mediated immunity. In the uterine decidua, the Th2 cytokine environment favors activation of B lymphocytes, resulting in stimulation of antibody secretion and suppression of cell-mediated immunity (3). This phenomenon is often referred to as the Th1-Th2 shift of pregnancy and is thought to contribute to maternal tolerance of the fetus by suppressing the antifetal cell-mediated immune response.",

That the local Th1-Th2 shift may also influence the systemic maternal immune response during pregnancy is evidenced in pregnant patients with autoimmune disorders. Women with rheumatoid arthritis, a predominantly cell-mediated autoimmune disorder, tend to experience remissions during pregnancy (4) . Similarly, patients with multiple sclerosis have fewer exacerbations while pregnant but worsening symptoms during the postpartum period (5) . Systemic lupus erythematosis, however, a predominantly antibody-mediated autoimmune disorder, often worsens during pregnancy, perhaps due to increased immunoglobulin synthesis and decreased clearance of immune complexes resulting from robust Th2 activity (3, 6) . These well-studied changes in severity of autoimmune disorders during pregnancy illustrate systemic immune alterations that occur in conjunction with the Th1-Th2 shift. Systemic suppression of cell-mediated immunity may contribute to increased susceptibility to some intracellular pathogens-including viruses, bacteria, and parasitesduring pregnancy.",

However, this agent is increasingly causing infection among immunocompetent persons. A mild or asymptomatic form of P. jiroveci infection occurs in immunocompetent hosts, and this infection may be more common in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women. In a small pilot study, nasal swabs from 33 healthy women in their third trimester of pregnancy were compared with those from 28 healthy nonpregnant women. P. jiroveci DNA was isolated from 5 of the pregnant women and none of the nonpregnant women (p = 0.04) (35) , which indicates that the immune changes associated with pregnancy may favor asymptomatic nasal carriage of this organism. Evidence also indicates that Pneumocytis pneumonia may be more severe during pregnancy (35) and that Pneumocystis may be perinatally transmitted by HIV-infected women to their children (34) .",
