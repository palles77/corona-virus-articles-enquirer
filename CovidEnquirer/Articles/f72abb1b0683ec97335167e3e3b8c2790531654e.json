This article summarizes the interpretation of laboratory results from rabbits. Hematological parameters can yield information about the red blood cell population and leukocyte response to stress and pathogens. Biochemistry evaluation can be used to investigate liver, kidney, and other organ function, and urinalysis results may yield additional information about kidney function and electrolyte imbalances. Serological tests are available for several pathogens of rabbits, including Encephalitozoon cuniculi, although the significance of positive results and antibody titers is not clear. Serum protein electrophoresis aids the understanding of protein disorders and the immune response to acute and chronic inflammation.",

There is little information available that describes the effect of clinical disease on the blood parameters of companion rabbits, or on the use of blood tests as diagnostic and prognostic indicators.

Many sites are described for blood collection in rabbits. Cardiac punc-ture is used in laboratory rabbits but is not recommended for pet animals. Both the marginal ear vein and central ear artery are easily accessible, but they may be difficult to access in some patients. Collecting a sufficient volume of blood from these sites to perform all of the desired clinical tests may also be difficult, especially from dwarf breeds with small ears. Sampling from ear vessels can occasionally result in thrombosis and subsequent avascular necrosis of parts of affected pinna tissue. Blood may be collected from the cephalic vein, which is straight and easily accessible, but, because of the short antebrachium, occlusion of the vessel by encircling the limb at the elbow is difficult. The cephalic vein is also small and easily collapses. The jugular veins are large and allow for ample-sized blood volumes to be collected, but jugular phlebotomy can be stressful for rabbits and may require chemical restraint. The dewlap may interfere with jugular vein visualization, especially in obese does. An accessible and efficient site for blood sampling in rabbits is the lateral saphenous vein (Fig 1) .",

Rabbit blood clots easily at room temperature and will coagulate quickly if not mixed with anticoagulant during collection.

Hemolysis can be prevented by letting the blood drop from the needle into the tube, but often, only a few drops can be collected before the blood clots. The technique can be improved by heparinizing syringes and needles through aspiration of a few drops of heparin into the syringe, then removing the excess with injection pressure.

Many texts amalgamate reference ranges from different sources to create ranges so wide that they include almost any result. Another problem is that healthy pet rabbits are very hard to find, so samples from rabbits with an apparently acute condition may also show changes due to an underlying chronic problem, such as malnutrition, improper husbandry, or subclinical disease.

Band neutrophils appear to be a rare finding in clinical infection, and the absence of a left shift does not rule out an infectious problem. An alteration of the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio showing a relative neutrophilia coupled with lymphopenia may indicate a response to infection. This ratio is approximately 1:1 in an adult healthy rabbit, but stress can alter the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio. Transport, waiting in a room full of unfamiliar sounds and smells, or even restraint for clinical examination can change the ratio. Gentle clinical examination and blood collection do not seem to affect the differential white cell count, whereas more prolonged stress like travel or exposure to barking dogs in the waiting room can induce a lymphopenia and relative neutrophilia, that may persist for up to 24 to 48 hours. 7 The total WBC can be used to further characterize acute stress from chronic stress (e.g., malnutrition, improper husbandry, prolonged social stress, dental disease), as both a leukopenia and lymphopenia are Eosinophil. Rabbit eosinophils measure 10 to 16 m in diameter and have a purple bilobed or horseshoe-shaped nucleus. The cytoplasm is obscured by so many granules that the cell looks orange-pink and foamy. The abundance of granules is the main difference between the eosinophils and the neutrophils. Removal of histamine and histaminelike toxins is the most important function of the eosinophils, suggesting that they therefore play an important role in controlling allergic reactions. more common with chronic stress.

In rabbits, lymphocytes are primarily found in the blood, spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes and the lymphatic tissues in the GI tract. The number of circulating lymphocytes is a balance between the cells entering and leaving the bloodstream and does not necessarily reflect a change in lymphopoiesis. In rabbits, it has been shown that an increase in adrenaline levels (acute stress) induces lymphocytosis, whereas raised cortisol levels (chronic stress) leads to lymphopenia. Viral diseases may result in a normal or higher lymphocyte count. Other causes of lymphocytosis are lymphoma and lead poisoning. 8 Eosinophilia in rabbits can occur when tissues rich in mast cells, such as the skin, lungs, GI tract, or uterus, are involved in disease. Eosinophilia can indicate the presence of an abscess and may be found during wound healing. In other species, eosinophilia is linked to parasitic diseases, especially when larvae are moving through tissues, but this is rare in domestic rabbits.

Although higher AST levels may be found in patients diagnosed with liver damage, struggling during col- lection or hemolysis of the sample also raises AST levels. Creatine phosphokinase levels also increase after restraint and are purely muscular in origin. LDH is produced by muscle and liver cells in rabbits and therefore is not beneficial as a diagnostic tool for many disease evaluations. Reference levels for AST, CK, and LDH can be found in Table 1 . In many mammalian species, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a useful indicator of hepatocyte damage because of its specificity for liver tissue and its long half-life (45-60 hours in dogs). In rabbits, ALT is not as useful as an indicator of liver damage as with other species because, like other herbivores (e.g., horses, cattle, guinea pigs), ALT is not liver specific and has a shorter half-life (around 5 hours). However, ALT concentrations are not affected by restraint and therefore can be used as a diagnostic tool. Slightly increased ALT levels are a common finding in apparently healthy rabbits. Mildly increased ALT levels in healthy rabbits have been attributed to exposure to low concentration of toxic substances, such as resins in wood-based litter or aflatoxins in food. 9 Raised ALT levels (with alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin and glutamyltransferase [GGT]) can be associated with hepatic lipidosis or may be found in patients with hepatic coccidiosis (Eimeria steidae) or torsion of a liver lobe. ALP is a widely distributed enzyme; liver and bone contain the highest concentrations, but it is also found in bowel epithelium, kidney tubules, and placenta. A physiological cause of high-serum ALP concentrations is osteoblastic activity in growing animals. Animals with bone lesions will show raised ALP levels. As a liver enzyme, ALP does not increase because of hepatocellular damage but is indicative of bile stasis (e.g., hepatic coccidiosis, liver abscesses, neoplasia, lipidosis). Extrahepatic causes, such as abscesses or neoplasia, can cause bile stasis by occluding the bile ducts. Rabbits produce 2 ALP isoenzymes in the liver. An intestinal isoenzyme is quite abundant, so serum ALP concentrations are actually the sum of these 3 isoenzymes, which may explain why many reference ranges are vague and wide and why raised ALP levels in clinically healthy animals are a common finding. ALP does have a diagnostic value because it is not altered by restraint and thus is considered a good indicator of real tissue damage. Reference levels for ALT and ALP can be found in Table 1 .",

Cellular causes of hyperbilirubinemia, and rarely icterus, are aflatoxicosis (e.g., eating moldy food), which induces hepatic fibrosis (ALT is usually raised too), and viral hemorrhagic disease, which causes acute hepatic necrosis with concurrent high levels of all hepatocellular enzymes. If the rabbit survives long enough, icterus may be seen. Bilirubin may also be increased in diseases that cause hemolysis (e.g., immune-mediated hemolytic anemia).",

Most laboratories report a total serum calcium value, which is the sum of bound and ionized calcium. Ionized calcium is a more precise measurement but is a more difficult and expensive parameter to test. Total serum calcium is influenced by dietary intake, serum protein levels, and other metabolic conditions. Calcium metabolism in rabbits is different from that in other animals. Blood calcium levels are influenced more by the calcium content of the diet than in the dog or the cat. Rabbits absorb calcium in proportion to the concentration of the ion in the gut, and the kidney eliminates the excess. Vitamin D is not important in calcium absorption if dietary levels are high, yet it does play an important role if dietary levels are low. Vitamin D is also important in calcium distribution within the body. As with other species, parathyroid hormone regulates blood calcium levels, but the level at which calcium is moved from the blood to the bones is high in rabbits. Consequently, blood calcium levels are higher, and the normal range is broader than that in other species. Growing youngsters and pregnant does use more calcium, resulting in lower blood calcium concentrations. In these rabbits blood calcium concentrations rarely rise above 14 mg/dL, even when fed calcium-rich diets, whereas adult rabbits on a varied diet can show calcium levels up to 16 to 17 mg/dL ( Table 1) . The urinary excretion rate of calcium is around 45% to 60% for rabbits, whereas most mammals excrete no more than 2% of their calcium through renal filtration. This predisposes rabbits to the formation of sludge and stones in the rabbit urinary system. Although the constant excretion of calcium could be a cause of renal failure in rabbits fed unbalanced diets, hypercalcemia is also a consequence of renal disease in rabbits because of the inability of the kidney to eliminate excess calcium.

The seropositive result may be due to past exposure to the pathogen, which is common within most rabbit populations. Further laboratory tests may be helpful to determine a definitive diagnosis. A correlation between antibody titers and neurological signs is hard to prove. A rising titer after 2 weeks is often considered diagnostic in suspect cases. The kidney is a target organ for E cuniculi, so evaluation of renal function and structure by biochemistry, urinalysis, and ultrasound may aid one's diagnostic overview. Inflammatory changes in the cerebrospinal fluid are suggestive of E cuniculi but are nonspecific. At the present time, the definitive diagnosis of rabbit encephalitozoonosis requires histopathology or isolation of the spores from the urine by microscopy or polymerase chain reaction assay.",

At least 3 months are needed for antibody levels to become measurable in the blood even with clinically evident dermatological lesions. This substantial lag in the development of antibody titers can lead to false-negative test results. Positive titers without skin lesions can indicate subclinical disease or previous infection in which the skin lesions are missed. Antibody titers fall rapidly once the rabbit is treated for T cunicoli. 2 Serological testing for P multocida is available in some countries, but its use in clinical practice is limited. A single positive response has no clinical significance because many rabbits harbor the bacteria in the nasal cavities without illness. A positive titer can also indicate previous exposure to the bacteria rather than clinical infection. Repeat testing after 2 weeks, while looking for a rising titer, can be helpful in obtaining a correct diagnostic evaluation. Results from rabbits younger than 2 months can be difficult to interpret because maternal antibodies are still present. A high antibody titer is not protective and may indicate subclinical disease.",

Care should be taken when performing a cystocentsis, because microtrauma to the bladder wall can stimulate local mineralization and it is possible to puncture the cecum, an enlarged uterus, or even an abscess. If bacteriology is not required, free catch from a clean litter tray is the easiest way to obtain a urine sample. Manual expression of the bladder should be done carefully because the wall is thin and ruptures easily, especially if an obstruction is present or the rabbit struggles. In cases of chronic cystitis, the risk for bladder rupture is lower because the bladder is thickened. It is preferable to collect the first urine of the morning and to run the analysis as soon as possible. Normal rabbit urine is dense and rich in minerals, so it should be centrifuged or filtered for biochemical analysis or examinations. Clear urine indicates low calcium excretion, which may be pathological because of renal failure or physiological in the case of growing or lactating rabbits. The color may range from light yellow to reddish brown. In most cases, dark urine is caused by dietary pigments; however, the urine should be checked for hematuria, which may be caused by uroliths, urinary tract inflammation/infection, uterine problems, or anticoagulants.",

Most normal rabbit urine is quite dilute, with an average SG of 1.015 (range, 1.003-1.036).
