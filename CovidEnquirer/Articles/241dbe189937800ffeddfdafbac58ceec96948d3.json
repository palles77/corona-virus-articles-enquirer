And due to massive panic buying of masks, Taiwan government has announced in February 3rd that face masks will be distributed through National Health Insurance (NHI) contracted pharmacies and drugstores started from February 6 th 2020. This policy might also correspond with declined of masks-related searches after D point (Taiwan CDC, 2020) Otherwise, searches for handwashing related information were relatively stable in 20 points and quickly increased in the fourth week of January 2020. These searches were gradually increased as declining of COVID-19 and face masks related searches.
