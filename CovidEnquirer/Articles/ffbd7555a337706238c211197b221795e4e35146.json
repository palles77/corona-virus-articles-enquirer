As such, we performed exploratory analyses in which we assumed that an unidentified exported case of COVID-19 was present in Iraq, Syria, Azerbaijan, or all 3 countries, in addition to Lebanon, Canada and UAE and estimated the outbreak size in Iran that would produce these results (Figure 2) . We also evaluated a scenario where we assumed perfect case detection in travelers from Iran, such that disease is truly absent in countries not reporting cases. Under this 'best-case' scenario, the estimated outbreak size in Iran was smaller but still substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases).",

Our analysis would be modified by travel restrictions from Iran due to recent political situations, and by variations in the R 0 value. Further, the lack of identified COVID-19 cases in countries with far closer travel ties to Iran suggests that cases in these countries are likely being missed, rather than being truly absent. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics. Supporting capacity for public health initiatives in the region is urgently needed.",
