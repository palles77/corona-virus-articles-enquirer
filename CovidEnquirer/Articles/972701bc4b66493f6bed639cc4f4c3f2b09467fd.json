Owing to its antibody spectrum, this egg powder was very suitable for this farm since mainly rotavirus was identified. Regardless of the dosage (2 g, 4 g, or 8 g egg powder), the calves (n = 164) which received specific egg-yolk antibodies via the whole egg during the first 14 days of life showed significant improvements in risk and duration of diarrhea and in body weight gain compared with calves of the control group (n = 80) which had not received any egg powder. These significant differences in body weight still persisted after 3 months of life. The mortality risk in the control group amounted to 8.8%, while in all egg powder groups (n = 164) only one calf died as a result of diarrhea. Breed-dependent differences in the parameters were not observed.",

The antibodies are extracted from either serum, colostrum, or milk (Snodgrass et al., 1977; Sadowski et al., 1983; Murakami et al., 1985; Yolken et al., 1990) . Specific antibodies are also produced from chicken eggs, and are used for diagnostics as well as for treatment (Bartz et al., 1980; Jensenius et al., 1981; LGsch et al., 1986) . The layer hens have to be immunized with the corresponding antigen in order to obtain specific antibodies from the egg yolk. The advantages of this method are the simple extraction of antibodies, the low costs, and the modest burden for the animals that are used for the production of antibodies. The efficacy of oral administration of egg powders containing specific antibodies which were produced from immunized layers could be demonstrated in challenge (Wiedemann et al., 1991; Ikemori et al., 1992; Yokoyama et al., 1992) and field trials (Erhard et al., 1993; Kellner et al., 1994; Lux, 1994) with calves and piglets. The field trials showed differences in body weight gain, and incidence and duration of diarrhea (Erhard et al., 1993; Lux, 1994) . In those field trials 22 g, 16 g or 8 g egg powder were administered per day and per calf during the first 10 or 14 days of life.",

Diarrhea was diagnosed according to the parameters faecal consistency score and the condition of the calves. Treatment of diarrhea was similar across groups, depending on the clinical state of the calves. If necessary, calves got electrolytes and/or antibiotics (tetracycline). Faecal samples were taken on Day 7 and, in cases where diarrhea was diagnosled, immediately prior to treatment. Identification of the infectious agent was carried lout in all faecal samples by means of the Lactovac\" ELISA (Hoechst Veterin'ti GmbH, UnterschleiBheim, Germany). This test can identify bovine rota-and coronavirus, and E. coli K99 pilus antigen, as well as cryptosporidia. Probes (1:2 diluted in PBS, pH 7.2) were interpreted as positive if the extinction at 450 nm was above 0.1 and the negative control was below 0.1. The minimal difference in extinction was set at 0.1.",

The average duration of diarrhea in the control group (3.5 days, sd 1.3) was significantly higher than in the egg-powder groups (2 g egg powder (n = 56) 2.0 days (sd 0.0, p < 0.001); 4 g egg powder (n = 53) 2.8 days (sd 1.8, p < 0.05); 8 g egg powder (n = 55), 2.3 days (sd 0.5, p < 0.05)). Furthermore, 26.3% of the calves in the control group had to receive an antibiotic and liquid-electrolyte treatment. Nevertheless, 8.8% of the calves in the control group died as a result of diarrhea, whereas only 12.5%, 9.1% ( p < 0.05), and 12.5% ( p < 0.05) of the calves in the 2 g, 4 g, and 8 g egg-powder groups, respectively, required additional treatment measures and only one calf died.

The diagnoses were blind and the clinical treatments used for diarrhea were the same for all groups The daily increase in body weight during the first 14 days of life (Fig. 1) -a parameter which can be measured impartially-additionally reflects the conditions. The calves of the control group gained 2.4 kg (sd 1.2) on average during the first 2 weeks of life, whereas body weight gains of 3.5-3.9 kg were recorded for the calves of the egg-powder groups ( p < 0.0001). Fio -. I. Body weight gain of Turkish diary calves during the first 14 days of life. Egg powder containing antibody to rotavirus at different dosages was administered to some calves. The controls did not receive any egg powder. Bars indicate sd. In some of the calves the birth weight could be compared with the body weight after 3 months of life. The birth weight of all groups was between 38.2 kg and 38.8 kg (sd between 1.6 and 3.2) on average. After 3 months the calves in the control group weighed only 85.2 kg (sd 3.9) compared with the significantly higher weights in the egg-powder groups; these were 88.5 kg (sd 2.3, p < 0.001, 2 g egg powder), 89.5 kg (sd 3.6, p < 0.0001, 4 g egg powder), and 89.8 kg (sd 2.3, p < 0.0001, 8 g egg powder; Table  2 ).",

Since the yield of egg powder per egg amounts to approximately 14 g, two eggs would be required per calf for the 2-week prophylaxis period.
