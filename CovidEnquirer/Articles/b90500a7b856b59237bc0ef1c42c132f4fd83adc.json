Interestingly, one of them equally inhibited both 3C pro and 3CL pro from PV and CoV, respectively.

Among them, RV is the major cause of the common cold, whereas EV and CV infection can cause hand, foot, and mouth diseases in human and animals. In severe cases, EV can damage the central nervous systems leading to viral meningitis, encephalitis, and severe myocarditis, as well as fatal pulmonary edema [2] [3] [4] [5] . CV strain B is a major human pathogen that causes meningitis and mycocarditis leading to heart failure in young adults and congestive heart failure [6] . In these PV, a chymotrypsin-like protease (named 3C pro ) is required to process polyproteins into mature proteins for viral replication, which represents a promising anti-viral drug target [7] .",

An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel human CoV, was spread from China to 29 countries in 2003, infecting a total of 8000 people and killing 800 patients [8] . SARS-CoV contains a 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) analogous to the 3C pro of PV, responsible for processing two overlapping polyproteins, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa). Other members of human CoV including CoV-229E, CoV-OC43, CoV-HKU1, and CoV-NL63 also require a 3CL pro in the maturation of viral proteins.",

However, their inhibitors can not be mutually used without modification. For example, AG7088, a potent inhibitor of RV and other picornaviral 3C pro [16] , failed to inhibit SARS-CoV 3CL pro [17] . Unlike the 3CL pro , which is dimeric and in which each subunit is composed of three domains, the 3C pro is a monomer with only the two catalytic domains. The structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 1) shows some sequence differences, which may alter inhibitor specificity. In this study, we performed high throughput screening using a library of 6800 compounds to find five novel inhibitors of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro , 4 of which also inhibited another human CoV-229E 3CL pro , but did not inhibit the 3C pro from RV14, CVB3, and EV71. But, one compound was found to almost equally inhibit these 3CL pro and 3C pro . From computer modeling, we rationalized the binding discrepancy of the inhibitors against these proteases. The information is useful to further develop more potent individual or common inhibitors of 3C pro and 3CL pro of PV and CoV for antiviral drug discovery.",

To rationalize the binding discrepancy of these inhibitors against these proteases, their binding modes with SARS-CoV 3CL pro and four other proteases were modeled and some of them are shown in Fig. 4 . The first four inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL pro are more rigid because the thiazolopyridine in 21155, the dichlorobenzoquinolinone in 22723, the isoindoledione in 27548, and the oxazole in 48511 adopt planar structures and the three substituents of the oxazole ring in 48511 are fixed in a conformer, due to the 1,2-steric interaction between the acetate group and the N-aryl imino group as well as the biaryl interaction between the phenyl and oxazole to prohibit their free rotation. All these compounds can be considered as two rigid aromatic moieties connected by a small linker. Based on the computer modeling, each of these aromatic moieties is bound to S1 or S2 site of SARS protease by forming H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4A-D) . As shown in the computer modeling, Glu166 side chain of SARS 3CL pro forms H-bonds with these four inhibitors. However, the corresponding amino acid residue in 3C pro is Gly164, which lacks the side chain to form H-bond with any of these compounds (also see Fig. 4F ), leading to loss of inhibition. In addition, the 3C pro have more open but shallow S2 site (due to its partial blockage by Leu127) than 3CL pro according to the crystal structures of RV 3C pro [20] and CVB3 3C pro (Lee et al., unpublished results) compared to 3CL pro (also see Fig. 4F ). Thus, 3C pro can not hold these compounds tightly.",

With this binding mode, the compound was predicted to also bind well in the 3C pro , consistent with the inhibition data. In fact, RV 3C pro prefers a phenyl group at the S2 site as evidenced by its strong inhibition by AG7088 which has a P2-fluorophenylalanine.

However, it did not inhibit 3CL pro from SARS-CoV [17] . This may be partially due to the blockage of its P1-lactam ring by the relatively larger Glu166 side chain and also the S2 site of 3CL pro is narrower although it is deeper. Therefore, when the P2-phenylalanine is changed to non-planar leucine or cyclohexane without changing the P1-lactam, they became good inhibitors of SARS 3CL pro [21] . Unlike AG7088, which is a ketomethyl isostere of a tripeptide-conjugated ester, compound 43146 is not peptidelike. From the random screening as shown in the study, we have found a starting point toward the development of non-peptide multiple-function inhibitors against CoV and PV. With further modification of these individual and common inhibitors of the viral proteases, we hope to find solution for the possible reoccurrence of SARS and other diseases caused by the viruses with the 3C pro and 3CL pro .",
