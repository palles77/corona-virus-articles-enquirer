            "text": "Zika was first identified, in a rhesus monkey, in the Zika forest of Uganda in 1947. 2 The following year, the virus was recovered from an Aedes africanus mosquito caught in the Zika forest 2 and in 1952 the first human cases of Zika were detected in Uganda and Tanzania. 3 A researcher in Uganda was infected with Zika while working on the virus in 1964 confirming that Zika virus causes human disease. 4 From the 1960s through to the 1980s Zika human infection was confirmed through blood tests; cases were generally mild and no deaths or hospitalisations were reported, but studies consistently showed widespread human exposure to the virus. The virus was also then seen across West Africa and into Asia. 5, 6 However, because Zika causes a mild illness with clinical similarities to dengue and many other tropical infectious diseases seen in the region, it was almost certainly mis-diagnosed and under-reported. The first large human outbreak was in the Pacific island of Yap in Micronesia in 2007. 7 Following this, between 2012 and 2014, the pattern of mosquito borne diseases in the Pacific islands changed with first an increase in dengue infections (and increased diversity of serotypes) and then increases in chikungunya and Zika. 8 Zika outbreaks were documented in French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Cook Island and Easter Island. Between November 2013 and February 2014, increased incidence of neurological complications, including 42 cases of Guillain-Barr e syndrome, was a unique and worrying feature of the French Polynesia outbreak. 8 In March 2014 French Polynesia also showed evidence of transplacental transmission of Zika infection for the first time. 9 It seems likely that Zika had arrived in Brazil by early 2015 with an outbreak of an unusual, but mild, illness in February to April. Zika was not suspected (as it had not previously been known in South America) and was not initially tested for. Phylogenetic analysis of virus from seven early Zika patients has subsequently indicated that Zika may have been imported to Brazil between March and December 2013. 10 However, in May 2015, Brazil confirmed the presence of circulating Zika virus and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHOdWHO's regional office for the Americas) recommended that countries in the Americas where the natural vectordAedes aegyptidwas present should develop and maintain surveillance systems for Zika and the capacity to diagnose it. 11 Shortly after this, Brazil reported neurological disorders including Guillain-Barr e syndrome apparently linked to Zika infection. Increasing numbers of cases led WHO to state: 'Given the worldwide spread of chikungunya and dengue, associated with urbanisation and globalisation, there is a potential risk of outbreaks of urban Zika virus infection in urban settings in any part of the world where the mosquito vector is present or may become established in future'. 12 Through 2016, numbers of suspected and confirmed cases of Zika infection rose steadily to a peak of~18,000 cases per week before declining to the current (December 2016) weekly average of~270 cases per week.",

WHO had been developing a global approach to research and development in outbreaks and emergencies as part of its learning from the Ebola experience. 15,16 This 'Blueprint' was a foundation for developing an R&D strategy for Zika in response to the PHEIC declaration and produced a first summary of priorities by March. 17 Initial priorities identified included: multiplex tests for flaviviruses, in addition to more traditional tests; protective vaccines based on killed virus (or other non-live) preparations for women of childbearing age and innovative vector-control tools that reduce the mosquito population. As a further extension of learning from Ebola, the UN established a Zika Multi-Partner Trust Fund to help secure funds to support the R&D efforts. 18 In response to the recognised difficulties in diagnostic testing for Zika, 19 WHO issued a Target Product Profile in April to support and direct research efforts to develop better tests. 20 The international reaction to the Zika PHEIC declaration was also different to the reaction to the Ebola PHEIC. During the Ebola epidemic, especially after the PHEIC declaration, many countries offered support to WHO and West Africa to help stop the outbreak and eventually to get down to zero cases. However, a number of countries introduced public health measures including restrictions on travel and trade that went beyond WHO recommendations and that were not justified, as noted by the International Health Regulations (IHR) Review Committee on the role of the IHRs in the Ebola outbreak. 21 In Zika, there was less obvious adverse impact on travel and trade and less evidence of countries instigating measures beyond those recommended by WHO as public health agencies and governments developed advice to their population, in particular the at risk groups, about travel to Zika-affected countries.",

An example was the scientific debate about vector control measures, especially the value, or otherwise, of disinsection of planes travelling from Zika-affected countries. Although disinsection of planes is routinely practised in many countries as part of a malaria control strategy, the Zika response illustrated that the evidence base for this approach is not robust and there were differences of view among public health agencies about the likely effectiveness of this measure leading to different national government interpretations of appropriate control measures. 23, 24 There were also challenges in developing advice on travel for pregnant women where, in the face of uncertain evidence on the risk, national governments tended to follow a zero risk approach with very precautionary advice. This was later reflected in advice on sexual transmission of Zika infection as this evidence evolved.",

Ultimately a flawed analysis of this risk led to calls for cancellation of the Rio Games. 26, 27 The real risk of spread of Zika caused by the games needs to be considered in the context of three factors. First, the games were scheduled for August and September which is the low season for mosquito activity in Rio when historical data shows that the incidence of dengue fever, an illness caused by a similar virus carried by the same mosquito vector as Zika, falls considerably and the same reduction could reasonably be anticipated for Zika. Second, enhanced active vector control plans were in place in Rio and were to be continued throughout the games period. Third, the additional volume of travellers associated with the games, although important, was not significant against the background level of trade and tourist travel to Rio. Indeed, Rio had already hosted the annual Rio Carnival, with larger numbers of visitors than were anticipated for the Olympics and Paralympics and at a high point in the Zika epidemic and peak mosquito season, without any evidence of generating global spread of Zika.",

It would also be naive to think that public health advice is the only factor considered by national governments in formulating advice to their populationsdthere will always be a range of factors to be considered and these will lead to different governments taking different views of the same evidence. The default approach from politicians is, understandably, always likely to be precautionary with a low tolerance for risk. Public health organisations need to learn to work with governments and politicians, to understand the factors that they need to consider, and to work within that to develop advice that best meets the needs of the situation.
