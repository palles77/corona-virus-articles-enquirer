The provision of quality palliative care requires the commitment and cooperation of a multiplicity of health care service providers, community organizations, professionals, and volunteers. Unfortunately, numerous studies across Canada have demonstrated that there is limited integration of community-based physicians, nurses, continuing and long-term care facilities, acute care (AC) hospitals, cancer centers, and palliative care specialists. 1, 2 This lack of integration can result in late referrals, unnecessary delays for treatment, or transfer to an appropriate setting of care and unnecessary suffering and cost. 1e3 Similar deficits and gaps to those identified in other areas of Canada were identified in studies conducted in the southeastern Ontario region from 1998 to 2000. 1,2,4e6 The surveys and focus groups revealed that there was minimal use of assessment tools, lack of evidencebased practice, discomfort of physicians in managing palliative-related symptoms, inconsistent symptom management practices, discontinuity of care at transition points, lack of coordination and communication between health care providers/services, underutilization of available resources, and unmet patient and family needs. 4e7 In response to these issues, a quality improvement project entitled the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox & Addington Palliative Care Integration Project (PCIP) was initiated in 2001.",

Primary activities for the project teams included: identification of common assessment tools; development of five evidence and consensus-based collaborative care plans (CCPs) designed to address functional status and symptom intensity; creation of six evidence and consensus-based symptom management guidelines; and education, implementation and use of common assessment tools, CCPs, and symptom management guidelines in every sector of the health care system.",

This resulted in a total sample size of n \u00bc 1,336 (99.2%) of the original number of patients. Some of the patients (n \u00bc 4) were alive for more than one year. compared to 2001, a smaller percentage of patients had at least one visit (P < 0.001). The percentage of AC hospital admissions decreased over the three years (P < 0.001) There were no differences in the percentage of persons discharged home vs. admitted or transferred to another institution. Table 2 summarizes what could be determined regarding location of death. Estimates of home deaths were not included because it was thought that the data was too unreliable at this time. Table 3 outlines incidence rates based on person-years for encounters to the following health services: ED, AC, Complex Continuing Care Palliative Care Unit, and Community Care. For a given time period, the total number of person-years is the sum of the time followed over the sample of patients. By using rates based on this value, we weight patients by how long they were followed and in doing so adjust for the known variation in utilization due to death. Because all of the encounters considered have duration, person-year rates of cumulative lengths of stay over the patient and year are also provided. For example, the incidence rate of ED encounters in 2001d2.56 encounters (i.e., visits) per personyeardindicates that if a ''typical'' patient from the 2001 sample were to be followed for the entire year, he or she would have presented to the ED roughly 2.56 times.

It is impossible to control for the many factors that change over a one-year period in the health care system. In 2002, one of the nursing agencies that provided home palliative care was closed. In 2003, SARS greatly affected the health care system and no doubt had some influence on ED visits and admissions to the AC hospital. It is interesting, however, to note that hospital length of stay for all cancer patients in this whole region increased during the same time period. One of the important lessons from this evaluation study was that it takes longer to implement projects than anticipated because unexpected situations, such as SARS or the demise of a key nursing organization, arise. It is, therefore, important to build longer timelines into the evaluation phase when trying to demonstrate system-level changes. Our experience would also suggest that standardized documentation should be in place prior to initiating such a project because it will facilitate both uptake and evaluation of key outcomes. Future projects should consider embedding a continuous quality improvement methodology in their processes so that there is simultaneous implementation, evaluation, and refinement of processes throughout the project duration.
