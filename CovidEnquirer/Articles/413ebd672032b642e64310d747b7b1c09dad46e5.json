The initiation phase includes multiple steps that ultimately result in the recruitment of a translation-competent 80-S ribosome to the initiation codon of an mRNA and the onset of polypeptide chain synthesis. A large set of eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) is involved in this process, which mediates the interactions among mRNA, initiator-tRNA, and the ribosomal 40-S and 60-S subunits. The region 5' of the translation initiation codon of an mRNA is called the 5' untranslated region (UTR), 5' noncoding region, or \"leader\" sequence, and plays an important role in the initiation of protein synthesis. Once the first peptide bond is formed, the addition of amino-acid residues to the growing polypeptide chain proceeds (elongation). Elongation is promoted by four elongation factors, and includes binding of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the \"A-site\" of the ribosome, followed by GTP hydrolysis, formation of the peptide bond, and translocation to the \"P-site.\" When the ribosome encounters one of the three termination codons, the newly synthesized polypeptide is cleaved from the peptidyl-tRNA (termination) by a release factor. How the 80-S ribosome dissociates from the mRNA has not yet been precisely defined. The elongation and termination phases of translation are mechanistically better defined than is the initiation step, and the biochemical pathways resemble those of bacteria in most major aspects (for reviews on translation in prokaryotes, see 1 and 2, and in eukaryotes, 3-5). On the other hand, eukaryotic translation initiation differs in many aspects from the situation in bacteria, and, not surprisingly, eukaryotic mRNAs possess structural features different from their bacterial counterparts. During the past few years, biochemical and genetic studies have provided sufficient data on the assembly of the initiation machinery and the function of specific factors to allow mechanistic models for translation initiation to be proposed. However, several important molecular events remain poorly defined, and their elucidation provides a challenge to those working in the field.",

Two types of translational regulation can be distinguished: global, in which the initiation rate of (nearly) all cellular mRNAs is controlled, and selective, in which the translation rate of specific mRNAs varies in response to biological stimuli. In most cases of global regulation, control is exerted via the phosphorylation state of certain initiation factors, whereas only a few examples of selective regulation have been characterized well enough to define the underlying molecular events. Interestingly, cis-acting regulatory sequences affecting translation initiation have been found not only in the 5' UTRs of selectively regulated mRNAs, but also in the 3' UTRs. Thus, in addition to the proteinencoding open reading frames, both the 5' and 3' UTRs of mRNAs must be considered for their effect on translation.",

This phenomenon was observed in mutants of vesicular stomatitis virus defective in cap methylation (14) .

However, some exceptions have been reported from in vitro studies (15) .

Very few natural transcripts have a 5' UTR of fewer than 20 nucleotides (2O), and synthetic transcripts need a leader longer than this for efficient translation (21) . A number of mRNAs, including several viral RNAs, contain remarkably long 5' UTRs in the range of 400-1200 nucleotides. Many cellular transcripts for proto-oncogene products, mitogens, or growth factors fall into this category. A possible reason for this is discussed in Section II,C,2. Long leaders, especially those containing (G+C)-rich sequences, have the potential to form stable hairpin structures which impede translation (22) .

Additional experiments in cultured monkey COS cells and in cell-free translation extracts revealed that similar hairpins further downstream of the cap can be readily melted by the initiation machinery, whereas structures with Gibbs energies in the range of -50 kcal/mol are resistant (26, 27) and appear to block scanning by the 43-S preinitiation complex (see Section I,C,l).

However, in all groups an obvious preference for a purine (A>G) at the -3 position upstream of the AUG was apparent. The conservation of sequences around the AUG start codon suggests a functional significance with regard to translation initiation, an assumption validated by mutational studies (36) (37) (38) .

Unlike bacterial mRNAs, which possess structural features (Shine-Dalgarno sequences) that facilitate a direct interaction with the ribosome through hydrogen bonding with the rRNA (for a review on prokaryotic translation initiation, see 45), eukaryotic mRNAs seem to lack comparable recognition elements. Several eukaryotic initiation factors (the eIF-4 polypeptides), which are involved in the interaction of the mRNA with the 4 3 3 preinitiation complex, have been identified and biochemically characterized: eIF-4E (24 kDa) directly binds to cap structures, while eIF-4A (44 kDa) has RNA-unwinding activity, which is ATP-dependent and requires eIF-4B (46). eIF-4A contains the characteristic \"DEAD\" box RNA helicase motif, and the relevant ATP-binding and catalytic domains have been mapped (47) (see also Section 111, D). The cap-binding protein eIF-4E and the eIF-4A/4B helicase can be isolated alone or as parts ofthe elF-4F multiprotein complex together with a 220-kDa polypeptide, termed ~2 2 0 , whose function is still unknown. eIF-4E is considered to be a major site of global translational regulation, and its stimulatory activity on translation correlates with the phosphorylation state of the protein, perhaps by stabilizing interactions between eIF-4E and p220 in the eIF-4F complex (48, 49) .",

According to one model, which probably accounts for most cellular mRNAs, the 5' cap structure is first recognized by eIF-4F, which facilitates binding of the 43-S complex. Subsequently, secondary structures within the 5' UTR are melted during linear 5'+3' \"stanning\" until the AUG codon is encountered (\"scanning model\") (50, 51 ). An alternative model states that the 43-S complex enters directly at an internal site within the 5' UTR (internal initiation model) (52-54). The two models and their variations are discussed in more detail in Section I,C. The ultimate purpose of the 43-S preinitiation complex is to reach and identify the initiation codon. A major role in the recognition process is attributed to eIF-2. Genetic studies in S. cerewisiue have identified mutations in the ci and p subunits of eIF-2 that allow aberrant (AUU) start-codon selection (55, 56) . Once the 43-S complex is directed to the initiation codon, with the aid of eIF-2, the anticodon of Met-tRNA interacts directly with the AUG codon by base-pairing (57) . As previously mentioned, the context around the AUG is a critical determinant for the recognition, but what makes a context favorable or not is currently unknown in molecular terms.",

Initial evidence supporting this model was obtained when capped reoviral mRNAs were translated in uitro in the presence of edeine, an antibiotic that perturbs the AUG recognition process (60) . Complexes that sedimented rapidly in glycerol gradients were obtained. Further mapping revealed that these complexes represent multiple 40-S ribosomal subunits distributed all over the mRNA. The apparent interpretation was that the 4 0 4 subunit normally associates with the mRNA at an entry site at the 5' end and moves toward the initiation codon where the 6 0 3 subunit joins. Edeine prevents this step, resulting in aberrant scanning and accumulation of multiple 40-S ribosomes along the mRNA. According to the scanning hypothesis, the 433 complex moves until it encounters a suitable initiation codon. Thus, if an upstream AUG is inserted in phase with the main reading frame, an Nterminally extended polypeptide is synthesized (61, 62) , whereas insertion of an out-of-phase upstream AUG causes the ribosome to translate an unrelated protein (63, 64). When the context of an AUG is unfavorable, it is bypassed by the 43-5 complex, which continues scanning until it encounters a \"better\" AUG, a process called \"leaky scanning\" (51 and references therein).

A moderate hairpin structure in the 5' UTR can be readily passed by the scanning 43-S complex, but more stable secondary structures (AG 5 -50 kcal/mol) block translation initiation. This impediment by the secondary structure is counterbalanced in cells overexpressing the cap-binding protein eIF-4E (31). Overexpression Recently, translation initiation of fused transcripts bearing the 5' UTR of cauliflower mosaic virus mRNA has been analyzed in plant protoplasts. These experiments yielded results that were unexpected in view of the scanning model (68). The authors suggest that the preinitiation complex joins the mRNA in a cap-dependent manner and begins to scan toward the AUG start codon until it encounters a region of stable secondary structure containing multiple AUGs. It bypasses this region by moving in a nonlinear fashion to downstream neighboring sequences and then continues scanning (ribosome \"shunt\").",

In eukaryotic cells, no natural bona fEde bicistronic messages have been found so far. However, mRNAs can contain one or more small ORFs upstream of the initiation codon. If the mini-cistron is not translated, the major ORF is translated by a leaky scanning mechanism. If it is translated, the major ORF has to be translated by a reinitiation mechanism. In the latter case, the translational efficiency is reduced compared to a similar message lacking an upstream mini-cistron. The mechanism of reinitiation is not well understood. It is thought that scanning can resume after translation of a short uORF and reinitiation occur at the next AUG. Hypothetically, some initiation factors remain bound to the 404 subunit during the translation of a mini-cistron. Thus, after termination of translation of the short uORF and dissociation of the 60-S ribosomal subunit, the remaining \"semi-preinitiation complex\" may recruit the missing components and be able to reinitiate thereafter (see Fig. 2 for a simplified scheme). The positioning and length of the reading frames influence the reinitiation efficiency. As one would predict, extending the distance between the mini-cistron and the major ORF increases the reinitiation efficiency (39), while long uORFs drastically reduce downstream cistron translation. A prominent example for translational regulation by a reinitiation mechanism is that of the yeast GCN4 mRNA. Its four uORFs serve as regulatory elements that modulate the translation of GCN4 in response to amino-acid starvation (for details, see Section 11,A).",

According to the scanning model, an uncapped structure-rich and upstream AUG-burdened mRNA would have to be translated extremely poorly. The finding that picornaviral RNAs are translated efficiently in infected cells has prompted new ideas about their mechanism of translation.",

Polioviral infection causes a drastic reduction in host protein synthesis and preferential translation of the viral mRNA (for reviews, see 69, 70) . The failure to translate the capped cellular mRNAs is associated with proteolytic cleavage of p220 by a virus-encoded protease (71, 72) . However, the proteolysis of p220 is not sufficient to cause complete inhibition of host protein synthesis (73). A long segment of the 5' UTR of the poliovirus RNA (region P) is necessary and sufficient to confer internal initiation to (bicistronic) indicator constructs (74- 76) . Small deletions within this sequence result in translation-deficient mutants, indicating that preservation of a large region is crucial for function.",

Another example of a cellular mRNA containing an IRES is the homeotic gene Antennapedia from D. mehogaster (86) . Internal ribosome binding is conferred by a 252-nucleotide segment, which is the shortest functional IRES identified so far. A 55-nucleotide region within this segment, found to be conserved between different Drosophila species, appears to be sufficient as an IRES in cultured Drosophila cells (54) .

This is indeed the case for the poliovirus (76) and GRP-78 (86) IRESs. Further experimental data in support of the internal initiation model are the following. Transfection of uncapped bicistronic transcripts containing a functional encephalomyelitis virus IRES into cells results in translation of only the second cistron (87) . Furthermore, translation of the first, but not the second, cistron of a bicistronic transcript can be competed out by a cap analog in a cell-free system (88) .

In fact, experi- mental evidence suggests that this may not follow the same path in all cases. Since the IRE% of polio-and rhinoviruses are positioned at considerable distance upstream of the initiator AUG, it has been suggested that the preinitiation complex scans the segment between the binding site and the AUG in a 5'+3' direction (76) (Fig. 3a) . On the other hand, the IRESs of EMCV and FMDV include the initiation codon, and the ribosome seems to bind directly to the AUG (94) (Fig. 3b ).

To bypass this barrier, the combination of uORF 1 with uORF 4 with the correct spacing is absolutely required, and uORF 1 serves under these conditions as a positive regulatory element in amino-acidstarved cells. The positioning of uORFs 1 and 4 with respect to each other and the GCN4 ORF is also critical for regulation, since the two uORFs placed in different order result in a repressed phenotype (109) . The length of the uORFs, rather than any specific sequences or structural elements, seems to be crucial, because regulation is primarily affected by perturbing the length, and only to a lesser degree by point mutations or replacement with heterologous nucleotides within them (109) (110) (111) .",

Under repressing conditions (when amino acids or purines are plentiful), translation will reinitiate at the next three uORFs. After translation of uORFs 2, 3, and particularly 4, it progressively loses the potential to reinitiate at the GCN4 start codon (Fig.  4a ). Under derepressing conditions, when amino acids are limiting, the scanning complex will \"ignore\" the downstream uORFs and traverse the leader sequence until it reaches the GCN4 start codon. In molecular terms, this is a result of a crucial component for reinitiation being missing, and only recruited on the way toward the GCN4 AUG, after the uORFs have been bypassed (Fig. 4b ). The prediction that uORF 4 is not translated under derepressing conditions is supported by the finding that extension of its length to 130 nucleotides in such a way that it overlaps with the first codons of GCN4 has virtually no effect on GCN4 translation (112) . An internal initiation mechanism appears unlikely, since insertion of stable secondary structures upstream and downstream of uORF 4 strongly diminishes GCN4 translation (112) . A central aspect in the regulation of GCN4 expression is the role of GCN2, a factor first identified genetically to stimulate GCN4 translation in amino-acid-starved cells. Cloning and sequence analyses of GCN2 revealed two domains, one with striking homology to serine and threonine kinases and the other, to His-tRNA synthetases (113) . The kinase domain is closely related to the double-stranded RNA-activated inhibitor (DAI) and the hemecontrolled repressor (HCR), two well-characterized mammalian kinases in- volved in global translational regulation under stress conditions. Both enzymes phosphorylate eIF-2a, thereby blocking eIF-2/GDP recycling by eIF-2B (GEF), and thus shutting off protein synthesis (114, 115 and references therein). A conserved lysine residue in the active site of DAI and HCR is also found in the kinase domain of GCNS (Lys-559). Substitution of Lys-559 with arginine or valine abolishes GCNB regulatory function (116), indicating that the kinase activity is involved in the activation of GCN4 translation. GCNB is also inactivated by mutations of the His-tRNA synthetase domain (116), suggesting that this region is critical for GCN2 function and that it regulates the kinase activity. Since the His-tRNA synthetase binds uncharged tRNA, which is abundant in amino-acid-starved cells, it has been proposed that GCNS senses amino-acid availability through this domain such that binding of uncharged tRNAs results in kinase activation. Phosphorylation of a protein factor involved in (GCN4) translation by GCN2 would derepress GCN4 synthesis (117).",

In cells where amino acids are plentiful, nonphosphorylated eIF-2a is an active component of the initiation complex. After translation of uORF 1, a new preinitiation complex, including eIF-2a, is rapidly assembled for reinitiation. Translation of uORFs 2-4 progressively diminishes the chances for another reinitiation event. Under these conditions, translation of GCN4 mRNA can only take place in GCD mutant cells, where the mutated eIF-2B fails to regenerate efficiently the eIF-2 pool and thus impairs eIF-2 function. In cells where amino acids are limiting, a fraction of eIF-2a is phosphorylated by GCNB and its recycling is slowed. As a result of a partial inactivation of eIF-2a, GCN4 mRNA is translated because rapid reinitiation is less likely, and therefore, uORFs 2-4 are bypassed. Under these conditions, reinitiation can occur when the GCN4 initiation codon is reached.",

A conserved regulatory element called an \"iron- mRNAs (127, 128) . The typical features of an IRE, which is -30 nucleotides long, include a six-membered loop with the sequence 5'-CAGUGN-3', and a base-paired region of somewhat variable length, which is interrupted by an unpaired C residue located exactly 5 nucleotides upstream of the first C of the loop. A protein that binds to IREs, the \"iron regulatory protein\" (IRP), is a cytoplasmic polypeptide formerly known as \"iron regulatory factor\" (IRF) (129), IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP) (130), ferritin repressor protein (FRP) (131), or P-90 (132). IRP is the molecular sensor of the iron levels in the cell, and has two affinity states for IREs. When cells are iron-deficient, IRP binds with high af\u20acinity to the IREs in ferritin and eALAS mRNAs, and blocks translation. When iron is plentiful, IRP has a low IRE-binding affinity, resulting in derepression of ferritin and eALAS mRNA translation.

The 5' UTR of murine c-myc mRNA inhibits translation of indicator constructs in uitro (158) and in oiuo after microinjection into Xenopus oocytes (159) . The region responsible was identified as residing within a 240-nucleotide segment. However, in uitro translation of the same constructs in HeLa cell extracts as well as transfection studies into several established cell lines such as COS-1, S194, 702/3, PD31, 38B9 (mouse pre-B cells), U937 (human monocytic cells), NIH 3T3, or P19 (mouse teratocarcinoma) failed to reproduce this inhibitory effect of the c-myc 5' UTR (159) . It appears that the function of the 240-nucleotide segment is host-dependent. Expression of c-myc in Xenopus oocytes is reduced during oocyte maturation, and the protein accumulates after fertilization during early embryogenesis (160,161) . The 5' noncoding sequences of c-myc mRNA seem to be involved in this developmental control mechanism, because microinjection of in uitro-transcribed reporter mRNAs carrying the c-myc 5' UTR into oocytes and early embryos reproduced the differential expression pattern without affecting mRNA stability (162) .",

As was found for c-myc, the long (G+C)-rich 5' UTRs, which are burdened with upstream AUGs and uORFs, acted as potent translational inhibitors. However, there is currently no evidence for an involvement of these uORFs in translational regulation. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of polyamines, cationic molecules essential for the growth of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Expression of ODC is induced by various mitogens and growth factors, and several mechanisms cooperate in the regulation of ODC activity. Characterization of ODC cDNA and genomic clones revealed sequence homologies among different species that extend from the protein-coding region into the noncoding region. The 5' UTRs are approximately 300 nucleotides long, are (G+C)-rich, and have the potential to form extremely stable stem-loop structures. The 5' noncoding regions of rat and hamster ODC mRNAs have been inserted into heterologous genes and were found to impair translation in uitro and in uiuo (173, 174) . Since the same effect was noticed when the hamster 5' UTR sequences were placed in the inverse orientation, the repression appears to be a consequence of the secondary structure rather than the primary nucleotide sequence. Interestingly, the ability of ODC mRNA to be translated in renal tissue was found to differ markedly between the two murine species Mus domesticus and Mus pahari. This difference correlated with small differences in the nucleotide sequences of the 5' UTRs of the ODC mRNAs, which destabilize the predicted secondary structure (175).",

As discussed in Section I,A,2, earlier translation of mRNAs with highly structured 5' UTRs is improved in cells overexpressed eIF-4E (31), which causes malignant transformation.

The context around the first AUG in the mRNA is not optimal for initiation. LAP translation is initiated mainly at the second AUG and thus contains the transcriptional activation and DNA-binding domains. Since the LAP initiation codon itself is also in a suboptimal context, leaky scanning causes initiation also at the third AUG, which is in an optimal context (180) . The resulting protein, LIP, contains only the DNAbinding domain and acts as a competitive inhibitor of LAP. Thus, two antagonistic eukaryotic regulatory proteins that differ only in their N-termini are translated from the same mRNA by a leaky scanning mechanism.

First, the antisense oligonucleotide must interfere with some step of mRNA translation, and second, the translationally arrested mRNA must remain intact. In addition, the oligonucleotides must possess suitable properties with regard to water solubility and efficient target RNA binding, and furthermore, give minimal non-specific effects on translation. They also must be chemically stable, resistant against nucleases, and, for studies in cell culture, efficiently internalized. In this section we describe different types of oligonucleotides fulfilling at least some of these criteria, occasionally including new types of oligonucleotides that have not yet been fully characterized, but that appear promising in this respect. Several excellent reviews have recently been published on the general use of oligonucleotides as molecular tools to turn off or to regulate gene expression (196-199) as well as on the use of antisense RNA for the same purpose (184, 200-203). We therefore focus our discussion on the applications of antisense technologies to the study of mRNA translation. However, as an introduction, we summarize relevant information concerning the chemical, biochemical, and biophysical properties of various oligonucleotides.",

Knowledge of the exact primary sequence of the target RNA aids in the rational design of antisense oligos. In vitro, it is usually possible to use a large molar excess of oligo to compensate for a low T,, provided that the employed oligo will cause few nonspecific effects on translation. If the secondary or even the tertiary structure of the target mRNA is known (274), the Regions of the target RNA containing stable stem-loop structures, formerly believed to be inaccessible to oligos, have been targeted successfully, resulting in the formation of \"pseudo-half-knots\" between the oligo and the RNA (269, 277) (Section IV). The formation of \"guanine quartets,\" found in telomeres (276, 278) and triple helices, has also been reported (243, 267 and E. Pascolo, personal communication). It is therefore possible to use oligos to create hybrids that mimic many different RNA structures. A final aspect to consider in selecting an antisense oligo should be its lack of selfcomplementarity. Even minor self-complementarity can result in sequestration of oligos away from the target RNA (236).",

The major threat to the mRNA in the hybrid is posed by RNase H, an enzyme that normally degrades RNA primers bound to DNA during the replication process (287). Although DNA replication is a nuclear event, the presence of RNase H in cytoplasmic extracts, such as the popular rabbit reticulocyte lysate and wheat germ extract for in vitro translation, must be considered (288) (Section IV). The cleavage of the mRNA by RNase H is taken advantage of for specific inhibition of gene expression in cultured cells. It even seems that RNase H cleavage is a prerequisite for high efficiency (see Section IV,B). PO-, PS-, and PS,-DNA oligos form hybrids with RNA similar enough to DNA.RNA hybrids to be recognized by RNase H (193) . Short stretches of only three consecutive PO-, PS-, and PS,-DNA nucleotides are sufficient for RNase H to cleave the complementary RNA strand (Table I) . Efficient cleavage of the target RNA by RNase H can be achieved with oligos of 2'-0-Me RNA containing short splints of PO-or PS -DNA (245,289) . Hybrids between RNA and a-DNA, MeP-DNA, PA-DNA, 2'-F-and 2'-O-alkyl-substituted oligos do not activate RNase H and therefore leave the target RNA intact (Table I) .",

The introduction of oligos in ways similar to plasmid DNA transfections has been considered to enhance uptake, as has the addition of lipophilic groups directly to the oligos. For an oligo to enter the cell, it must be actiuely transported across the cellular membrane. The kinetic parameters of this transport are summarized in 297. Uptake of PO-and PS-DNA oligos reaches a plateau after 12 hours at 37\"C, whereas no uptake occurs at 4\u00b0C. PO-or PS-DNA oligo uptake was maximal at 10 pM. Human HeLa and African green monkey CV1 cells take up oligos with similar efficiency, whereas HeLa S, cells do not. The length and the type of the oligo also influence the efficiency. Oligos up to 30 nucleotides in length are readily taken up. The higher efficiency of uptake of PS-DNA oligos over PO-DNA oligos has been attributed to higher nuclease resistance and their nonspecific adherence to cells due to their inherent \"stickiness.\" In addition to enzymatic degradation of the oligo and nonspecific binding to the outside of the cell, problems in developing solid methods for monitoring the uptake has been another reason that reliable information on the actual pathway of oligo uptake into cells has been difficult to obtain. The uptake of POand PS-DNAs presumably occurs by receptor- mediated endocytosis (283,295, 298-300) . Uncharged MeP-DNA oligos, on the other hand, seem to be internalized by pinocytosis (fluid-phase endocytosis) (217, 301) .

Carriers [liposomes, calcium phosphate, poly(L-lysine) (PLL), and positively charged macromolecules], receptor ligands (transferrin), electroporation, and microinjection have been used. Oligos delivered by liposomes are efficiently taken up into cells by fusion with the cellular membrane and entry via the endocytotic pathway (283, 291) . The oligos are also protected from degradation in the culture medium, if enclosed within the lipid vesicle (not the case for the popular \"lipofectin\" method, in which the oligos adhere to the surface of the vesicle). Low efficiency of enclosure of the oligo (-3%) is still a limiting factor for this type of delivery (302). Coupling the oligo to PLL, an efficient transmembrane carrier, enhances the uptake (292). The combined use of PLL-conjugated oligos and heparin decreases the otherwise toxic effects of PLL on L929 cells. Oligos linked to proteins, which act as carriers (directly or via receptors), also enter cells more readily than free oligos do (303-305).",

The most undesirable final destination is unfortunately also the most probable: the lysosome, where nucleic acids are normally disposed of by the cell (307). The distribution of oligos within cells also depends on the mode of delivery. In one study (308), it was shown that the efficiency of oligo uptake is a function of the cell type, and that electroporation is consistently more efficient than passive uptake. After electroporation, most of the oligo was located within the nucleus, some was within endocytotic vesicles, and the remainder was in the cytoplasm. In contrast, in nonelectroporated cells most of the oligo was found in small intracytoplasmic vesicles, little was in the cytoplasm, and virtually none was in the nucleus. A similar distribution pattern was also reported for cells microinjected with oligos (309, 310) . Consistent with these results, c-myc expression decreased far more rapidly in electroporated cells than in cells that passively took up the anti c-myc oligo. Electroporation required less than one-fifth of the oligo, which was sufficient to achieve a comparable level of c-myc inhibition.",

Both Numerous reports have described the successful use of oligos for inhibiting the expression of specific genes, mainly with permanent cell lines rather than in primary cultures. This inhibition is mostly due to mRNA degradation, at least in the cases in which the oligos employed are known to stimulate RNase-H activities. The primary cleavages most likely occur in the nucleus, where RNase H and oligo are plentiful (251) . This type of inhibition is hallmarked by a decreased level of the targeted mRNA. The primary degradation products can be exceedingly difficult to detect, because they would be unstable within the cellular environment. Cleavage by RNase H, however, clearly indicates that the oligos were bound to the mRNAs. Therefore, other types of oligos that do not elicit an RNase-H response should also be able to bind to (pre-)mRNAs and interfere with steps in mRNA metabo-lism. Nuclear events, such as splicing and 3'-end processing as well as reverse transcription, which takes place in the cytoplasm, were shown to be d e c t e d by intercalator-extended a-DNA and MeP-DNA oligos in Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells as well as by 2'-O-alkyl oligos in Trypanosomu brucei (352-356).",

An informative strategy for analyzing this particle and for characterizing the functional roles played by each of its subunits has been depletion and purification of individual components from splicing extracts. Using nuclease-resistant oligos from the 2'-O-alkyl series with biotin or DNP linkers (Fig. 8) , efficient removal and isolation of separate small nuclear RNPs were achieved by hybridization of specific antisense oligos to their HNA components or the pre-mRNA (236,237). We have recently applied a similar strategy to arrest translation initiation intermediates by forming oligo.mRNA hybrids (Fig. 1Oc) (Section IV,A) . Using streptavidin coupled to paramagnetic beads, these initiation intermediates can be isolated under relatively \"gentle\" conditions (Fig. 1Oc) . This procedure offers advantages over the \"stressful\" and lengthy sucrose gradient centrifugation and should furthermore allow a higher degree of biochemical resolution between related complexes (3444.

By using a biotinylated oligo annealed to the 3' UTR of a translationally regulated mRNA, it is possible to analyze regulatory RNA-protein interactions occurring in the 5' UTR (e.g., the IRE/IRP) of the transcript (H. E. Johansson, N. K. Gray and M . W. Hentze, unpublished) (Fig. 1Od) . This approach provides an alternative to crosslinking of proteins, and even offers the option of subsequent purification. This may be particularly relevant in cases in which proteins do not crosslink in spite of binding to the RNA (359, 360) . Extracts from cells that overexpress the mRNA of interest should allow &nity purification of specific factors binding to the mRNA after the addition of an oligo targeted to the 3' UTR. While many cytoplasmic mRNPs are surprisingly stable and withstand sucrose gradient centrifugation, we know nothing about those that do not. In conjunction with &nity selection of translation initiation intermediates (see above), this approach may further allow us to determine at which step in the initiation process the binding of a regulatory protein to the 5' UTR interferes with translation.",

One of them, the mRNA of the Mst87F gene, contains a 12nucleotide element [called a \"translational control element\" (TCE)] in its 5' UTR that confers translational control to heterologous transcripts in vivo(179). The TCE operates as a negative regulatory element and is conserved in a cap-proximal position within the mRNAs of at least six other members of the family. Complete deletion, point mutations, or placement of the regulatory sequences further downstream of the cap result in derepression of translation, which is accompanied by lengthening of the poly(A) tail. It is conceivable that the TCE constitutes a binding site for a repressor protein acting in trans, in a mode reminiscent of the translational inhibition mediated by IRE-IRF or other RNA-protein interactions in the 5' UTR of mRNAs (141). However, it is incompletely understood how 5' UTR sequences can affect polyadenylation in the 3' UTR of an mRNA.

The recognition of the role of RNase H in the degradation of the mRNA that was hybridized to DNA (288, 329, 330) shed a different light on early DNA.oligo-mediated translational inhibition studies, both in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and wheat germ extract (25, 331-333). The utility and the function of RNase-H-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis have recently been reviewed (334) and we concentrate here on RNase-H-independent mechanisms of translational arrest. While some of the results with DNA.oligos could have originated from hybrid arrest of translation, signified by a physical blockage of translation initiation and an intact mRNA, without exclusion of the involvement of RNase H, the mechanistic aspects of these reports must be interpreted with care (25, 332, 333, 335). Antisense DNA can specifically block translation independently from RNase H in the (rare) batches of reticulocyte lysate where the RNase H content is low enough, as demonstrated in a series of well-controlled experiments (31 7, 318, 336). Inhibition of translation by DNA oligos in wheat germ extracts is, on the other hand, invariably, partly caused by the high content of RNase H. In contrast to the way in which DNA-like antisense oligos commonly function, MeP-DNA, PA-DNA, and a-DNA oligos inhibit translation in an RNase-H-independent manner",

The authors found that the 2'-0-allyl oligos microinjected into cells failed to affect Tag expression. In contrast, oligos able to activate RNase H caused a dramatic decrease in tag expression. Other results obtained with 2'-0-Me oligos (344) and 2'-O-alkyl oligo variants (245) further support the notion that RNase-H stimulation plays an important role in mediating strong and reproducible inhibition of gene expression in viuo. Several conclusions can be drawn from the application of doubly modified non-RNase-H-activating PS-2'-O-Me oligos to inhibit the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in human lung carcinoma A549 cells (357). PS-DNA oligos repressed ICAM-1 expression more efficiently and with less target site-dependence than PS-2'-O-Me oligos. For PS-2'-0-M e oligos, only one of those directed against the 5' UTR repressed ICAM-1 expression. The repression by PS-DNA oligos correlated with a reduction in ICAM-1 mRNA, whereas the 5' UTR PS-2'-O-Me oligo did not affect the mRNA level. Finally, neither type of oligo affected transcription.

If the 3' end of the oligo extends beyond the first nucleotide of the 5' UTR and presumably base-pairs with the m7G, binding of eIF-4E is inhibited (350). In reticulocyte lysates, binding of the eIF-4E component of eIF-4F is affected by 2'-0-a1lyl oligo.mRNA hybrids starting exactly at the first nucleotide of the mRNA (excluding the cap) and extending 15 nucleotides downstream (3444. This finding contrasts with the previous studies using purified factors. While eIF-4E binds directly to the cap in uitro, the substantially larger eIF-4F complex very likely constitutes the functional entity in uiuo and in uitro. Binding studies to 5' UTR analogs have indeed suggested that up to 35 nucleotides of the 5' UTR may be involved in binding this factor (351). 0ligo.mRNA hybrids further down in the 5' UTR and around the AUG initiation codon most likely inhibit initiation of translation in a manner similar to that of intramolecular helices. In addition to preventing eIF-4F binding to the cap, hybrids may, depending on their position, act by interfering with binding of further initiation factors (eIF-4A/B, eIF-3) (25), the 43-S preinitiation complex, by blocking the preinitiation complex from reaching the AUG or by preventing the 60-S ribosomal subunit from joining the 40-S subunit and the Met-tRNA, at the AUG.
