            "text": "The modulation of proteolytic activity is an important factor in regulating the metabolism and function of peptide hormones, in this study, the activities of dipeptidyl (carboxy)peptidase (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]), aminopeptidase N (APN), and dipeptidyl (amino)peptidase IV (DPP IV) were measured in the blood, the human bronchial epithelial and alveolar cells, bronchoalveolar macrophages, and the soluble phase of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from normal human volunteers and patients with pulmonary pathologic conditions. BAL fluid expressed ACE activity and very low levels of APN and DPP IV activities in the volunteer population, but higher levels could be measured in samples from patients. In patients, increased APN corresponded to a high granulocyte count, while DPP IV and ACE were associated with a high percentage of lymphocytes. Neither AIDS nor smoking induced an increased level of these enzymes. Immunohistochemical staining of bronchoalveolar smears with anti-human ACE monoclonal antibody showed that only macrophages expressed this enzyme. Enzyme histochemistry for DPP IV and APN showed that all leukocytes expressed these activities. APN, DPP IV, and ACE activities were also found in cell extracts of bronchoalveolar macrophages. In extracts of bronchial epithelial and alveolar cells, only APN and DPP IV activities were detected. Kinetic properties of the soluble enzymes in lavage supernatants were comparable to those of serum enzymes. These results demonstrate that soluble forms of cellular enzymes found in BAL fluid are regulated independently of blood and that different cell types may release these enzymes. (J Lab Clin Med 1997; 130:603-14) Abbreviations: ACE = angiotensin-converting enzyme; AIDS = acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; APN = ominopeptidase N; BAL = bronchoalveolar lavage; DPP IV = dipepfidyl (amino)peptidase IV; ~GTP = -y-glutamyltranspeptidase; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; IC50 = 50% inhibitory concentration; K M = Michaelis-Menten constant; PBS = phosphatebuffered saline solution; Z-= benzyloxycarbonyl-Proteolytic enzymes are involved in the activation, transformation, or degradation of proteins and peptide hormones in various regulatory pathways, during the processing of peptide antigens for presentation by immunocompetent cells or the degradation of extracellular matrix. Thus a tight control of protease activities is necessary to maintain normal cell function. Proteolytic processing of a hormone by a particular enzyme may modulate its biologic functions, and peptide hormones can often be processed by several different proteases, depending on both the access of an enzyme to specific hormones and the presence of substances modulating protease activity. Membrane-bound and soluble proteases may have different enzymatic potencies and different access to peptides as a function of the relative locations of the peptide and the enzyme.",

            "text": "Several cell surface antigens defined as leukocyte differentiation markers have been shown to be proteolytic enzymes that are also expressed by epithelium, endothelium, or other tissues, demonstrating that leukocyte differentiation implies a modulation of protease expression, a However, factors involved in these differentiation phenomena are not well understood. Under some pathologic conditions, APNbut not DPP IV-is specifically expressed by mononuclear cells, 2 while activation of alveolar macrophages differentially stimulates the expression of cathepsin D and APN. 3 HIV infection also modifies proteolytic activity. [4] [5] [6] Epithelial cells, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes are able to express and secrete many hydrolytic enzymes, as well as their inhibitors. Although some information has been gained on the protease-antiprotease imbalance in the lung in emphysema, 7 the regulation of peptidases involved in the metabolism of small peptides has not been extensively evaluated in the pulmonary bronchoalveolar space. In the present study, the enzymatic activities of two aminopeptidases (APN and DPP IV) and a dipeptidyl (carboxy)peptidase (ACE) were measured as soluble enzymes in BAL fluid and as cell-bound enzymes in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B, a non-tumorigenic cell line with a phenotype close to that of a bronchial cells), s alveolar epithelial cells (A549 cells, derived from an alveolar type II carcinoma [ATCC]), and bronchoalveolar macrophages. These enzymes were evaluated in the human BAL fluid obtained from normal human male volunteers and from patients with various lung disorders and were compared with cellular reparfition between macrophages, granulocytes, and lymphocytes.",

The amount of inhibitor necessary to inhibit half of the activity (IC50) of both serum and BAL ACE activities was higher than postulated by the inhibition constants.

Patients with sarcoidosis (Fig. 3 , A, group B) had significantly elevated levels of ACE activity, but an elevated level of this enzyme was also found in patients with blood malignancy (Fig. 3 , A, group G). A normal level of ACE activity was found in the other pulmonary disorders, including interstitial pneumopathy (sarcoidosis excluded), infection, neoplasia (groups C to F) when comparison was made with normal volunteers (group A). No specific condition could be found for patients with ACE activity values below the normal range. APN activity was increased in some samples of pulmonary infections (Fig. 3, B , groups D and E) and DPP IV activity in some samples in all groups, except for samples from patients with blood malignancies (Fig. 3, C) . In BAL samples from a small group of patients with sarcoidosis (n = 4), APN activity was found to be in the normal range (0.15 U/ml), whereas DPP IV activity was increased (0.55 U/ml) in accordance with results obtained with high lymphocyte counts (Table IV) . To analyze the effects of two known modulators of the immune system, the effect of AIDS pathology or of current smoking (more than 10 cigarettes per day) was evaluated (Table V) . It was concluded that neither condition alone importantly altered the level of the proteolytic enzymes studied. However, smokers did exhibit a lower ACE activity in BAL fluid when compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.05).",

The expression of peptidases either in pulmonary cells or in the supernatants of BALs had been previously shown for a few enzymes. For example, in a rat model, carboxypeptidase M and neutral endopeptidase 24.1116 were released into BAL fluid. However, the evaluation of enzyme activities in bronchoalveolar cells, in supernatants, and in the blood in normal human studies has been performed only for ACE. 17 Our results demonstrate that ACE, APN, and DPP IV were secreted in the human epithelial lining fluid as soluble enzymes and were expressed by specific cells of the bronchoalveolar surface, macrophages (ACE, APN, and DPP IV) and epithelial cells (APN and DPP IV). The absence of correlation between ACE enzymatic activity in BAL supernatants and blood under normal situations suggested an independent regulation in both biologic compartments. This is further confirmed by high levels of APN and DPP IV activities measured under normal situations in the blood and almost undetectable activities in BAL fluid. In normal volunteers and in patients, the activity of ACE was detectable in all samples; however, the activities of APN and DPP IV were very low under normal situations but were dramatically increased in some pathologic samples. ACE (EC 3.4.15.1) is a ubiquitous membranebound ectopeptidase of wide specificity that is able to remove dipeptides and some tripeptides without processing from the carboxyl end of proteins. Its potential substrates include bradykinin, substance P, angiotensin I, and enkephalins. The use of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension is sometimes linked to cough, possibly because of an increased bronchial reactivity and a decreased degradation by this enzyme of the proinflammatory peptides bradykinin or substance p.18 Interestingly, we found a lower ACE activity in BAL fluid from smokers than in that from other groups. Because ACE is involved in bradykinin degradation, this might have potentially important implications for the effect of smoking on peptide metabolism.",

Second, the kinetic of inhibitor binding to enzyme(s) may be complex, which may explain an incomplete inhibition.
