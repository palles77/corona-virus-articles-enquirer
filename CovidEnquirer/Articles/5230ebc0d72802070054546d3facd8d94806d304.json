Centralization and modernization of microbiology services has already taken place in some countries (e.g. the UK and Germany) or is being considered by a range of healthcare regions and countries. Current trends include concentration of resources (formation of larger microbiological units from the closing of smaller laboratories), amalgamation of services (creating multidisciplinary laboratory facilities), outsourcing of microbiology diagnostics, automation of sample handling and diagnostics, mandatory accreditation, and broadening microbiology staff competencies in order to improve the flexibility of the available workforce. 4 These encompass specimen reception, decontamination services, cleaning, ordering, secretarial work, blood science support and even mortuary duties, the latter an unwelcome addition for inexperienced laboratory assistants.",

There is little awareness of the impact from loss of rapid testing, altered communication patterns, aspects of specimen timing and transport factors, all of which threaten the safety of patient care, as well as complicating infection prevention and control. Any potential benefits from financial savings, cross-cover options and a greater number and array of possible tests cannot necessarily compensate for deterioration in service quality. Sadly, many managers do not really understand what microbiologists do and how quickly they can do it in the event of an emergency. 5 It is also true to say that there is minimal scientific or other evidence to justify decisions on service amalgamation. 1 Here we summarize some of the potential consequences of centralizing microbiology services in the UK and beyond.",

There is little evidence to justify a hot facility at the present time, and indeed its creation may lead to unforeseen health and safety issues, as well as problems with out-ofhours cover and governance (http://www.britishinfection.org/ professional-affairs/csc-mvd/). 1 Should there be significant distance between peripheral and central laboratories, however, then it is reasonable to consider a restricted service capable of processing selected microbiological tests (see Box 1) .

All laboratory facilities, whether peripheral/hot or central, remain subject to health and safety standards, spillage containment, waste disposal, appropriate decontamination, and quality control and inspection in accordance with regulatory frameworks. In such circumstances, an acute hospital should campaign for retention of the original facility, given the lack of evidence for financial benefit from replacing it with a hot laboratory; laboratory staff could, however, undertake to liaise and work with the larger/ central laboratory to enhance services. Strong support from senior clinicians such as intensivists and oncologists may assist in maintaining on-site diagnostic services.

Communication difficulties are a major concern, with the potential for delayed and/or poorly prioritized telephoned reporting and tardy response from an overloaded hospital switchboard. Developments in information technology (IT) infrastructure may help ameliorate this (see below). There may also be delays in timely processing of antibiotic levels, which could lead to withheld doses, or, if given, increased toxicity risks. Partially processed and/or unprocessed specimens transported from a peripheral laboratory could compromise organism survival; there may also be reporting mismatch; handling risks in the event of an accident; and chance of specimen loss, breakage and/or contamination in transit. Indeed, alerting users if specimens are unlabelled, contaminated, leaking, or inappropriate will also be subject to significant delay if sent to the central laboratory before deficits are recognized. It is poor practice (and embarrassing) to inform a clinician that another specimen is required hours or days after it was originally taken, especially if the patient has gone home or it was difficult to obtain, e.g. joint aspirate; or it cannot be repeated, e.g. abscess drainage; or the patient died; or the patient subsequently received antibiotics, thus rendering any bacteriological analysis obsolete.",

Formal reporting would itself be compromised by increased specimen load, as well as difficulties in locating a specific result following a request for clinical advice. 1 Even a few hours of additional delay in processing may be critical for a septic patient or for identifying or controlling an outbreak.

The choice lies between expansion of one system at the expense of the other(s) or procurement of a totally new system for all sites which is usually extremely expensive. Both options present a number of challenges: data retrieval from abandoned data base(s) and loss of years of microbiological data for individual patients, units, specialties, and surveillance programmes. Clinical microbiologists rely heavily on past microbiological histories in order to manage acutely unwell patients. Previous reports of specific pathogens and associated antibiogram assist greatly when advising on empirical therapy. For hospitals that have already experienced centralization, lack of a common IT system across a network has compromised service delivery with significant reporting errors. 1 Clinicians working in peripheral hospitals may be unaware of results that could have a direct impact on clinical care. 1 New systems promote the need for staff training and updates. Laboratory reporting procedures need agreement and harmonization between different hospitals. There may also be unforeseen decommissioning fees and expensive advice from IT consultants. As with any computer system, but particularly that linking a laboratory with acute hospital services, the potential chaos resulting from system failure, malfunction or crash will inevitably affect patients and staff. 1 Contingency plans must be put in place whatever the scenario to safeguard patient safety arising from unscheduled loss of laboratory data that could delay or compromise clinical decisions, extend waiting times, and impact upon operating timetables.

There is a statistically significant increase in the mortality rate for patients who have blood cultures processed after a delay (i.e. Gram stain performed !1 h after being detected as positive; P \u00bc 0.0389). 14 The number of organisms present in adult bacteraemia is frequently low, often <1\u00c210 3 colony-forming units (cfu)/L; this increases the risk of negative cultures if there is a delay in delivering cultures to the laboratory, and especially so if the pathogen itself is less resilient outside the human host. 15 If direct placement on to the appropriate analyser is not possible, blood cultures may be pre-incubated in a separate incubator. 16 An inadvertent consequence of this is that 2e5% of positive cultures will be undetected when they are eventually placed on to the analyser after pre-incubation. 17 Streptococcus species, yeasts, and non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria, e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are missed by continuousmonitoring blood culture systems if pre-incubated at 35e37 C. 18, 19 When pre-incubation has been sufficiently long for the organism to have gone through the growth phase and reached stationary or decline phase, bottles containing such organisms will not trigger the analyser. This is because detection is dependent upon biochemical changes during the growth phase.",

Specifically, in the event of an outbreak at a peripheral hospital, there is a risk that a subtle increase among key pathogens goes unnoticed among the specimen bulkprocessed at the central laboratory. Linked cases of specific infections in time and space are more likely to be detected in a hospital with its own microbiology laboratory and resident microbiologist when there is ample opportunity for multiple liaisons with BMS and infection prevention and control personnel throughout the day. The case in point is illustrated by the outbreak at the Vale of Leven hospital in Scotland, where no one noticed escalating reports of toxin-positive Clostridium difficile over weeks and even routine surveillance mechanisms failed to alert sister hospitals and national reporting bodies. 21 The subsequent public inquiry noted that there was no consultant microbiologist based on-site before and during the outbreak. 21 The infection control nurses (ICNs), an integral part of the infection control team, may be isolated at a peripheral site where there is no laboratory, no consultant, or reduced access to a consultant. Furthermore, the opportunity to discuss an issue in person with the consultant microbiologist can often alleviate a bigger problem as well as providing support to ICNs when liaising with senior management or nursing colleagues. Communication difficulties between microbiologist and ICNs may result in delays in side-room 'juggling', which increases outbreak potential and compromises bed management.

In networks where infection specialists have been closely involved in designing and implementing change, progress has been made: fit-for-purpose IT systems, investment in technology, and extended service provision in time and techniques. It is true to say, however, that many of these have also taken place in the absence of networks. Clearly, evidence for patient and financial benefit from centralization is urgently needed.",

If it is determined locally, increased clinical risk following centralization could be attributed to clinicians rather than managers. Medical staff should highlight the clinical consequences from laboratory closure and try to retain on-site services if at all possible.

The answer is variable, but quite often it is 'no'. 2, 32 Feedback from colleagues in peripheral laboratories indicates that they failed to see any benefits after centralization; this includes a lack of financial return as demand management and streamlined testing algorithms have been lost. It is possible that the original review supporting the creation of laboratory networks failed to consider basic principles of diagnostic microbiology and its public health contribution, as well as the spiralling increase in antimicrobial resistance and continued risk from pandemic and/or novel pathogens. 3 Laboratory reviews, themselves hugely expensive, do not necessarily recognize hidden costs such as taxis for specimens and staff, IT overhaul, travel expenses, extended working hours, decommissioning charges, telephone switchboard upgrade, and redundancy payments. The most damaging costs are, however, subtle deterioration in infection prevention and control services and delayed responses to clinical problems, including poor antibiotic management. 33 Even highly experienced consultants in non-infection specialties do not always know which antibiotic might save a life, or which specimens could aid rapid diagnosis courtesy of on-site attention. Moving services off-site denigrates patient care at the expense of perceived financial savings.",

The clinical microbiologist acts as a 'gatekeeper' for the approval of requests for testing, contributing towards a cost-effective service. 4 Separating the clinical microbiologist from patient care risks undermining the diagnosis and management of infection and fragments the infrastructure underpinning infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship. 4 Removing the consultant from a laboratory could precipitate an infection control disaster costing thousands of pounds and causing unnecessary deaths. 21 The microbiology laboratory, BMS, support, consultant(s) and infection control staff comprise a package that does not function at a high quality level if fragmented. 34 Furthermore, unlike other laboratory sciences, microbiology and infection control contribute enormously to public health, not just locally, but nationally and internationally. The work performed by a microbiology laboratory provides the basis for all infection management, antimicrobial stewardship, and infection control policies for the benefit of the hospital, healthcare region, and further afield. This is best accomplished by retaining clinical laboratories on the same site as the healthcare institution they serve. This is especially pertinent in the case of acute hospitals, in order to provide the public and the physicians who care for them with the necessary diagnostic testing, means of epidemiological detection, and future innovation required in an era of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. 20 ",
