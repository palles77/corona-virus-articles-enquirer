The glycoprotein consists of a heavily glycosylated exterior domain, a single membrane spanning region, and a large cytoplasmic domain that contains tyrosine phosphatase activity. To investigate the function of this family, we generated T cell clones that lacked L-CA (L-CA-). The expression of the ap T cell receptor, CD3, CD4, IL-2 receptor (~55) LFA-1, Thy-l, and Pgp-1 (CD44) was normal. The L-CA T cell clones failed to proliferate in response to antigen or cross-linked CD3; however, they could still proliferate in response to 11-2. An L-CA+ revertant was obtained and the ability to proliferate in response to antigen and cross-linked CD3 was restored. These data indicate that L-CA is required for T cells to enter into cell cycle in response to antigen.",

Different cell types express family members in a precise manner that is controlled during both cell lineage differentiation and activation. L-CA is encoded by a single gene located in a syntenic region found on chromosome 1 in both humans and mice (Ralph et al., 1987; Hall et al., 1988; Saga et al., 1988; Seldin et al., 1988; Johnson et al., 1989) . The family is generated by differential splicing of three consecutive exons that encode sequences near the amino terminus of the molecule. A total of eight possible mRNAs can be generated, of which six have been isolated as cDNAs (Barclay et al., 1967; Ralph et al., 1987; Saga et al., 1987; Streuli et al., 1987; Thomas et al., 1967) .",

The external domain, based on protein biochemistry, interspecies sequence comparison, and genomic structure, can be divided into four subdomains (Thomas, 1989) . The region at the amino terminus is predicted to be a random protein structure containing O-linked carbohydrate sites. The O-linked carbohydrate region is followed by two separate cysteine clusters and then a short spacer region before the membrane-spanning region. The differential use of the three variable exons results in changes in the O-linked carbohydrate region. Since the regulation of alternative splicing of L-CA mRNA is a highly regulated event, it appears likely that the carbohydrate structures are of functional importance.",

This activity is likely to be important for cellular function since sequence comparison between species shows a remarkable degree of conservation: 65% over 700 amino acids. The large cytoplasmic domain of L-CA is divided into two 300 amino acid tandem repeats that share 35% identical residues. Each subdomain is approximately 35% homologous to another tyrosine phosphatase, PTPase 1B . This suggests that both cytoplasmic subdomains will have tyrosine phosphatase activity, but with different substrate specificity and perhaps different regulation.",

            "text": "The function of L-CA has been a long-standing puzzle. The recent demonstration of tyrosine phosphatase activity suggests that L-CA may be involved in the regulation of hematopoietic cell growth. This has been supported by studies using antibodies to L-CA that have implicated this family in the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes. The proliferative response induced by the lectin phytohemagglutinin or the cross-linked anti-CD3 antibody can be modulated using monoclonal antibodies to L-CA (Bernabeu et al., 1987; Martorell et al., 1987) . Similarly, modulatory effects are also seen by cross-linking L-CA to other surface glycoproteins (Ledbetter et al., 1988) . Anti-L-CA antibodies can inhibit cytolysis by NK cell or cytotoxic T lymphocytes; they can also inhibit B lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production (Seaman et al, 1981; Nakayama et al., 1982; Newman et al., 1983; Harp et al., 1984; Yakura et al., 1986; Mittler et al., 1987) . Direct evidence, however, that L-CA is involved in leukocyte cell growth has been difficult to obtain. To investigate the function of L-CA, we generated mouse T cell clones deficient in their expression of surface L-CA (L-CA-). We report here that these clones are altered in their capacity to divide in response to antigen and provide evidence that L-CA is involved in the initiation of signals required for cell division.",

As expected, both the parent and the L-CA-clones failed to respond when only the spleen filler cells were present ( Figure 5A ). Remarkably, when the specific antigen pigeon cytochrome c was added to the cultures, all the L-CA-clones failed to respond appropriately (Figure 58 ). This was not merely a result of a shift in the antigen dose response of the mutants ( Figure 6A ). The L-CA-clones failed to respond even to doses as high as 1 mg/ml. In comparison, both the parent and the L-CA-clones proliferate in response to 11-2, although the response is weaker for the L-CA-clones (Fig- ure 5C). In five separate experiments, the response of the L-CA-clones to antigen was on average 9% of the response of the parent, while the response to IL-2 was 77%. The IL-2 source for the experiments shown in Figure 5 was from phorbol-stimulated EL-4 cells, however, similar results were obtained if recombinant IL-2 was used ( Figure  6B ). In a dose response assay, the L-CA-clones did respond to 11-2, but the response was not as great as that of the AE7 parent. Examination of the ~55 chain of the IL-2 receptor by flow cytometry indicated that the mutant not only expressed this component but that the L-CA-clone increased the surface expression to a greater degree than that of the parent after stimulation with antigen and IL-2 (Table 2 ). This indicates that the diminished growth was not due to the lack of the IL-2 receptor in the L-CAclones. When antigen and IL-2 were added simultans ously to the cultures, the proliferative response of the parent and the mutant clones was always less than when only IL-2 was present ( Figure 5D ). Since the L-CA-clones fail to respond to antigen, our ability to grow these cells in vitro is presumably a result of the addition of an exoge nous IL-2 source. a Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry using a Becton-Dickinson FACS 440. Fluorescent intensity was measured on a four-log scale and was divided into 255 channels. b Cells were stimulated with antigen and IL-2 on day 1. For each experiment, IL-2 receptor was measured on the last day prior to stimulation (day 15 and day 13 of the previous stimulation for experiments 1 and 2. respectively) and then either day 6 or day 5 poststimulation.",

In one of the L-CA-clones, AR-M2-11, a spontaneous revertant arose, A.E7-M2-llR, which was detected by the change in morphology and increased cell growth rate. Cells were isolated and examined by flow cytometry and confirmed to be L-CA+ ( Figure   9A ). The L-CA+ revertant cells, when analyzed for proliferation, regained their ability to divide in response to antigen and anti-CD3 ( Figures 9B and SC) . This, therefore, indicates that the L-CA-mutant, A.E7-M2-11, has a functional T cell receptor-CD3 complex but requires the L-CAglycoprotein for the induction of the proliferative response. The revertant was identified at the fifteenth passage postcloning and the A.E%MP-11 clone was still entirely L-CAat the twelfth passage ( Figures 1B and 2) . Therefore, since the L-CA+ cells have a selective growth advantage over the L-CA-cells, the appearance of the L-CA+ revertant could not be due to a contamination during cloning. It should also be noted that since the L-CA+ cells do have a selective growth advantage, it is not surprising that revertants are identified.",

This indicates that the defect in the L-CA-cells was specific for the L-CA glycoprotein. Further evidence that the proliferative defect in the mutant cells was due to the failure to express properly the L-CA glycoprotein was obtained by the analysis of a L-CA+ revertant. These cells proliferated in response to antigen, cross-linked CD3, and IL-2 in a manner similar to the parent clone. It is highly unlikely that a double revertant would be obtained simultaneously for two separate mutations and therefore, the most straightforward interpretation is that the increase in proliferation is due to the reexpression of surface L-CA glycoprotein.

Therefore, the normal expression of many of the glycoproteins known to be involved in recognition, adherence, and signal transduction further indicates that the lack of L-CA surface expression is the cause of the proliferative defect. The L-CA mutant clones synthesize a protein recognized by the 13/2.3 antibody, however, the protein is not transported to the cell surface (Figures 2 and 3) . This suggests that the mutation causes a specific retention of L-CA at some stage of transport and may be similar to mutations described for influenza hemagglutinin protein, the El viral coat protein of coronavirus, and the low density lipoprotein receptor (Gething et al., 1988; Machamer and Rose, 1987; Pathak et al., 1988) . Structural mutations have been described for these proteins that cause a specific retention in the biosynthetic pathway. Since it is still formally possible that the mutation in the L-CA-cells effects L-CA and some other unknown component of the T cell receptor-CD3 complex, we are currently conducting experiments to transfect the complete L-CA cDNA into the L-CA-cells to determine whether or not this will also correct the proliferative defect. If expression of L-CA by transfection does not correct the proliferative defect, then this would indicate that some other component of the T cell receptor complex is also effected in these cells. However, the most likely explanation for the proliferative defect described here is the failure to properly express the L-CA glycoprotein.",

L-CA is expressed by all leukocytes, so it was not anticipated that a negative L-CA phenotype would dramatically effect specific antigen signaling through the T cell receptor-CD3 complex. However, this is reasonable if one assumes that T cells have evolved from primitive cell types that at one time were not antigen-specific. It is possible that T cells have adapted antigen-specific triggering for cell division utilizing molecules that are generally used in leukocyte cell division. This is supported by the observation that the L-CA tyrosine phosphatase domain is highly conserved throughout invertebrate and vertebrate evolution, indicating that this domain is extremely important in some aspect of cell physiology, such as cell cycling (R. J. Matthews and M. L. Thomas, unpublished data) .",

            "text": "The lack of L-CA on the cell surface resulted in the failure of the cells to divide in response to antigen. Since this, presumably, is due to the failure of the proper signals being transduced to the tyrosine phosphatase domain, it is logical to conclude that antigen-induced cell proliferation requires the dephosphorylation of a tyrosine residue. Many growth factor receptors have a tyrosine kinase domain. It is thought, therefore, that tyrosine phosphorylation is also required for the induction into cell cycle. These two observations may at first appear to be incongruous. However, the src gene family of tyrosine kinases is regulated by the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Hunter, 1987) . Dephosphorylation at this site causes an increase in tyrosine kinase activity (Cooper and King, 1988; Cartwright et al., 1987; Amrein and Sefton, 1988; Marth et al., 1988) . It is possible, therefore, that L-CA functions by regulating tyrosine kinase activity. Dephosphorylation of unknown kinase would cause an increase in the tyrosine kinase activity, thus initializing a cascade of events that results in cell cycling. It is interesting, therefore, that Ostergaard et al. (1989) have indicated that Ick, a member of the src gene family, is a substrate for L-CA. They have observed that position 505 in Ick, the regulatory tyrosine site, is not phosphorylated in L-CA+ lymphomas but is phosphorylated in L-CA-lymphoma mutants. The Ick tyrosine kinase has been identified in complexes with CD4 and CD8 and is a candidate for signaling through the T cell antigen receptor (Rudd et al., 1988; Veillette et al., 1988) . It is possible that a failure to activate Ick by dephosphorylation accounts for the results obtained here. The sequence around position 505 in Ick is highly conserved in all members of the src gene family ( Figure 10 ). It is interesting to note, therefore, that a similar sequence is to be found near the carboxyl terminus of the second L-CA subdomain ( Figure 10 ).",

            "text": "Since the interactions for the external domain of L-CA may be important in activating the tyrosine phosphatase domains, a question arises regarding the ligand for the external domain. Evidence exists that the carbohydrate structures are an important functional moiety of the L-CA glycoprotein (reviewed in Thomas, 1989) . Briefly stated, the external domain of L-CA is heavily glycosylated, bearing many N-linked and O-linked carbohydrates, and is a major surface glycoprotein on lymphocytes, comprising approximately 10% of the cell surface. Therefore, L-CA bears many of the carbohydrates of these cells. Furthermore, there are differences in L-CA carbohydrate structures between lymphocyte lineages, and these structures can change upon activation (Brown and Williams, 1982; Cook et al., 1987) . More compelling though, is the observation that the difference between family members is due to differential splicing of three exons that encode O-linked carbohydrate sites. Since the expression of these carbohydrate sites is controlled in a precise developmental and activational manner, this strongly suggests that the carbohydrates are of functional importance. It has also been shown that the carbohydrate groups from L-CA will block NK cell binding to targets (Gilbert et al., 1988) . The carbohydrate residues on L-CA may interact with lectins on cell surfaces, and this cell-cell interaction is necessary for induction into cell cycling. While the data strongly suggest that carbohydrate groups on L-CA are functionally important, this does not eliminate the possibility that L-CA could be activated by other interactions (for example, interactions with a soluble ligand or movement in the cell membrane).",

The nuclei were pelleted, and 250 WI portions of the supernatant were brought to 1 ml with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 0.5% deoxychoiate, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% human serum albumin, 0.02% NaNs, 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM PMSF, 2100 KiUlmi aprotinin, and 10 uglmi ieupeptin. Either 10 ul of ascites or 100 ni of tissue culture supernatant of a monocionai antibody was added and incubated overnight at 4OC. The next day, 50 ul of goat anti-rat immunoglobulin coupled to Sepharose CL 48 was added, mixed for 2 hr at 4oC, pelleted, and washed three times with the above buffer and once with PBS. Samples were dissolved in 50 nl of reducing Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.",

In contrast, approximately equivalent amounts of the surface protein Pgp-1 (CD44) were found on the mutant cells as well as the parent line(Figures 2 and 4). When total surface-were examined by SDS-PAGE, the only visible difference appeared to be a high molecular weight protein (Figure 2). This high molecular weight protein is most likely L-CA since L-CA is a major cell surface glycoprotein of AI7 cells. L-CA-cells were also examined by immunoprecipitation of biosynthetically labeled cells and by Northern blot analysis(Figure 3).
