Vaccination is the important prevention means against both infections. To achieve a PRV genome-based virus live vector, aiming at further TGEV/PRV bivalent vaccine development, a recombinant plasmid pUG was constructed via inserting partial PK and full-length gG genes of PRV strain Bartha K-61 amplified into pUC119 vector. In parallel, another recombinant pHS was generated by introducing a fragment designated S1 encoding the major antigen sites of S gene from TGEV strain TH-98 into a prokaryotic expression vector pP RO EX HTc. The SV40 polyA sequence was then inserted into the downstream of S1 fragment of pHS. The continuous region containing S1fragment, SV40 polyA and four single restriction enzyme sites digested from pHS was subcloned into the downstream of gG promoter of pUG. In addition, a LacZ reporter gene was introduced into the universal transfer vector named pUGS-LacZ. Subsequently, a PRV genome-based virus live vector was generated via homologous recombination. The functionally effective vector was purified and partially characterized. Moreover, the potential advantages of this system are discussed.",

            "text": "Like TGE, PRV infection (Aujeszky's disease, AD) is another serious, worldwide problem in swine that cause significant economic losses. In young piglets as well as in the other susceptible species, PRV infection is often fatal, and animals die from central nervous system disorders [20] . Taxonomically, PRV belongs to the herpesvirus group of enveloped animal viruses, which constitute a large family of DNA viruses whose genome consists of linear, double-stranded, noncircularly permuted DNA molecules [21] . The genome of the herpesviruses has been divided into three or five classes (depending on different nomenclatures); correspondingly, the genome of PRV is a class 2 or class D [22, 23] . PRV genome of approximately 150 kb encodes at least seven glycoproteins [24, 25] . gE (gI), gC (gIII), gI (gp63), and gG (gX) are not required for viral growth in tissue culture and are therefore designated non-essential [26e29]. In contrast, gB (gll), gD (gp50), gL and gH (gL and gH are a complex) are thought to be essential for PRV replication [30e34]. The multiple nonessential regions within the large size genome of PRV allows the insertion of large and/or multiple DNA fragments encoding foreign antigens to create vectored vaccine. Furthermore, PRV has a broad host range, infecting most mammals and some avian species. However, higher primates including humans are not susceptible to infection [20] . These characteristics, together with the verified immunogenicity [35] and the nononcogenic properties, make it suitable to exploit PRV and its genome for vaccine development.",

In contrast, the inactivated vaccine is relatively safe, but it produces weaker lactogenic protection to the piglets. It is supposed that immunogenicity of the latter is too low to induce adequate S-IgA. Currently, some genetic engineering subunit vaccines are also being under investigated [37e39] . Although this kind of vaccines may prevent the infection to piglet from authentic virus, the low immunogenicity, difficulty of inoculation and production cost, etc. are still bottlenecks for their actual application.

Some recombinant viral-vectored vaccines derived from adenovirus, baculovirus, vaccinia virus, herpesvirus or retrovirus have been studied for that purpose [40e48]. Besides vaccinia virus and herpesvirus including PRV, other above-mentioned viruses share some inherent deficiencies for vaccine exploration, such as smaller nonessential region size, need for helper virus or specific host cell lines and poor safety. The application of vaccinia virus vector is also partially limited due to its relatively narrow host range. In contrast, PRV, as a member of herpesvirus demonstrates some significant advantages: firstly, there are multiple non-essential regions within the large genome of PRV, allowing up to 40 kb insertion of foreign genes; secondly, this virus can result in efficient mucosal infection capable of inducing a stable specific immune response; furthermore, PRV indicates no evidence for oncogenesis [49] . More recently, a bivalent vaccine prepared by integrating NS1 protein gene of Japanese encephalitis (SA14-14-2) virus into PRV genome illustrated the enormous potential and exploited prospects for future application of PRV genomebased vector [50] .",

Some foreign genes, such as human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), Escherichia coli LacZ or glycoprotein E1 of hog cholera, have been expressed by the same way [51e53]. It was reported that the heterologous fragment insertion in gG gene gave rise to no changes in cell tropism and virulence [54] . Interestingly, however, we found that the cytopathic effect (CPE) caused by the recombinant was morphologically different with that infected by parental virus (Bartha K-61), in which the former demonstrated vacuolization, and the latter showed syncytia formation (data not shown). Further experiments are needed to determine if the dissimilarity was due to the deletion of gG gene or the insertion of foreign gene. The aim for insertion of SV40 polyA sequence in the construct is to improve the stability of mRNA, facilitating mature mRNA through nuclear membrane into cytoplasm and enhancing the foreign gene expression. Using the parental vaccine virus as template to amplify homologous arms of enough length will guarantee both effective recombination frequency and safety. Theoretically, the recombination probability between PRV genome and transfer vector in cellular nucleus is about one in a thousand; the integration of Lac Z reporter gene greatly contributes to the screening of recombinant virus. Meanwhile, PCR performed with site-specific primers has demonstrated the incorporation of S1 fragment of TGEV into the PRV genome. The recombinant virus displayed the similar replicative kinetics as the parental virus, which allows us to hypothesize that the expression of S1 subunit of TGEV can be detected in the future. The transfer vector possesses significant universality due to the introduction of multiple cloning sites; therefore, it can also be utilized for generation of multifold and/or multivalent vaccines.
