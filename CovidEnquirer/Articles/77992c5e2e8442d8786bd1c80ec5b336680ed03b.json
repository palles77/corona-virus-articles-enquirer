            "text": "Influenza causes considerable morbidity and mortality in the human population worldwide. Annual outbreaks in the United States claim over 36 000 lives and cost billions of dollars. 1,2 Antiviral therapy is available, 3 but the emergence of human H1N1 viruses that are resistant to oseltamivir and human H3N2 viruses resistant to amantadine 4 have raised concerns about the use of these antivirals. Vaccination remains the most effective defense against influenza 5,6 but the process of vaccine strain selection and antigenic drift of human influenza A virus isolates has led to mismatches between vaccines and circulating virus strains. 7 The threat of another influenza A virus pandemic is a continued concern, particularly because of increasing exposure of humans to avian and swine strains of influenza A virus. [8] [9] [10] Accurate, specific, and rapid detection and quantification of influenza virus are critical for successful development of diagnostic tests, antiviral drugs and vaccines. Assays that are based on virus-induced cytopathic effects such as the plaque forming unit (pfu) and the tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) are still commonly used to quantify influenza virus, but such assays are time-consuming and laborintensive. 11 Antibody neutralization assays which are used for studies of vaccine efficacy include the hemagglutination inhibition assay and the microneutralization assay, share similar limitations. 12, 13 Considerable effort has been devoted to improve methods of cell-based antiviral influenza drug screening using a colorimetric or fluorometric readout that is based on inhibition of virus-induced cytotoxicity. In one such method a cell viability assay, which measures ATP via a luciferase luminescence system, was shown to give comparable results to the use of a neutral red assay. 14 Cell lines containing a virus inducible reporter gene have been used successfully to detect retroviruses such as Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), [15] [16] [17] DNA viruses such as Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and RNA viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 23 Recently, a detection system for influenza A virus was developed based on a virus-inducible reporter gene segment (VIRGS). 24 These preliminary studies with transiently transfected cells demonstrated the potential of this approach to detect and quantify influenza A virus using a luciferase or green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene system. These findings prompted us to generate permanent cell lines using linearized plasmid DNA integrated into the host cell chromosome. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of these cell lines in objective, rapid, and quantitative assays for virus quantification, virus neutralization assays, and drug screening assays. We have applied the acronym enzyme-linked virus inhibitor reporter assay (ELVIRA) for this technology and our cell lines as ELVI-RA \u00d2 Flu A or Flu B (Diagnostic Hybrids, Inc., Athens, OH, USA).",

The firefly luciferase (pGL-2-Basic; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) or GFP (pEGFP-1; Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) reporter genes were inserted into the Pme I site of the resultant pHH21 \u2044 UTR plasmid. The Pol I promoter \u2044 UTR \u2044 reporter gene cassette was removed from the above vector and inserted into the pRep4 vector. Finally, the EBV origin of replication and EBNA-1 gene were deleted from the plasmid with restriction endonucleases Ssp I and Spe I to generate plasmids pHH21influenza A virus \u2044 Luc-Hyg and pHH21influenza A virus \u2044 GFP-Hyg. A similar strategy was used for the influenza B virus UTRs from the NP segment of the B \u2044 Yamanashi strain.

New technologies that promote these goals will result in the development of better drugs and vaccines to control seasonal influenza and hopefully prevent or lessen the impact of a pandemic. In this study, we describe the successful establishment of stable cell lines engineered to contain influenza virus-inducible reporter genes. These cells form the basis of rapid and objective assays that can be used to measure the titer of infectious virus, the titer of neutralizing antibody, and the susceptibility of influenza virus strains to antiviral drugs. The concept of VIRG was described a number of years ago 17, 20, 32 and was first successfully applied to influenza viruses by Lutz et al. 24 In this proof-of-concept report influenza virus-dependent reporter gene expression was demonstrated using an RNA segment that was transcribed from a human polymerase I promoter and contained a reporter gene flanked by untranslated regions (UTRs) from the influenza nucleoprotein (NP) RNA segment. Unfortu-nately, the transient and the episomal expression systems used in this previous work have drawbacks when attempting to apply this technology to robust and reliable assays that could be used for industrial or clinical applications. In this report, we generated stably transformed cell lines and demonstrated that these cell lines can be maintained for many passages without loss of their phenotype with respect to virus-induction of the reporter gene. We have also extended the technology to influenza B virus which is a component of most influenza vaccines and which contrib- utes to significant morbidity and mortality during many influenza seasons.",

A linear dose-response relationship between reporter enzyme activity and virus inoculum was observed. This observation allows the use of reporter enzyme levels as a surrogate marker for virus amount in assays that depend on knowing how much virus is in a sample. Of course, a standard curve must be generated for each strain, but for many applications the strain of virus is known and this approach will be easily applied. For detection of unknown strains an empiric assessment of the ability of the virus to induce reporter enzyme levels will have to be performed.",

None of the respiratory viruses we inoculated onto the cell lines induced significant luciferase activity above background levels. There was some level of cross-induction between influenza A and B viruses, but the induction by the homologous virus was many-fold higher than by the heterologous virus. In a recent report, it was shown that activity for the type B polymerase machin-ery with a type A promoter depends on the specific RNA segment and that the levels of activity differ between type B strains. 33 Using plasmid transfection they observed that type B polymerase machinery that is composed of homologous subunits is functional with a type A promoter albeit to a variable extent depending upon the segments from which the regions downstream of the promoter sequence were derived. These authors did not assess delivery of the polymerase genes by virus infection which may explain the greater specificity we observed.",

We determined the titer of stocks of a number of strains of influenza A virus including five H5N1 strains by using the TCID 50 method and by using either ELVIRA \u00d2 Flu A-luc cells with luciferase as the readout or MDCK cells with CPE as the readout. The titers determined with the two methods were very similar despite the fact that there may be differences in susceptibility of the two cell lines to the virus strains tested. More strains need to be tested to support the use of the ELVIRA \u00d2 Flu A-luc cells for this purpose, but there are clear advantages in terms reduced time to result (e.g., 1-2 days versus 4-6 days), greater objectivity, and less labor.",

            "text": "Titration of neutralizing antibody is an assay that can potentially benefit from use of these cell lines. It is clear that the induction of reporter enzyme depends on infectious virus. Using immunized mouse serum we demonstrated that the neutralizing activity of antiserum can be identified as a function of the reduction in luciferase activity and that titers can be calculated based on a 99% inhibition. The HI assay is currently the gold standard for measurement of immunity following vaccination. Comparison of neutralization titers between the two methodologies showed a reasonable correlation though it is not surprising that the titers were not identical given that each assay measures neutralization in a very different manner. The assay described in this report offers a number of advantages over other virus neutralization assays that are based on various endpoints. 34, 35 Finally, we applied this technology to an assessment of antiviral susceptibility. We observed excellent doseresponse when measuring luciferase activity versus drug concentration for two antiviral compounds that have a mechanism of action that acts after virus entry. 31 Calculated IC 50 values were very similar to published reports using the amantadine-sensitive virus strains. We have not used this method for neuraminidase inhibitors. However, the results suggest that the ELVIRA \u00d2 Flu A-luc cells could be used for screening of novel antiviral agents and for quantifying antiviral potency. Identification of new antiviral lead compounds depends on robust primary assays for high-throughput screening of large libraries of compounds. Methods have also been developed for rapid evaluation of compounds for antiviral activity in 96-well microplates, which include visual quantitation of antiviral activity based upon inhibition of virus-induced CPE or by less subjective colorimetric or fluorometric means. 36 A cell-based screen for potential influenza antivirals that measures the CPE induced by influenza virus (A \u2044 Udorn \u2044 72, H3N2) infection in MDCK cells using the luminescent-based CellTiter Glo system was recently described. 14 Recently, a viral inhibition assay based on neuraminidase (NA) activity was described and shown to be suitable for high throughput screening to identify potential antiviral compounds or to identify drugresistant influenza strains. 37, 38 Fluorometric and chemiluminescence NA assays have also been described. 39, 40 The application of the technology described in this report may also be used for primary antiviral screening. One advantage is that the readout is a direct function of viral RNA replication and transcription.",
