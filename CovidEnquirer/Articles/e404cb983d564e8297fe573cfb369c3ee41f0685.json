            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can invade the male germline, and sperm-introduced HBV genes could be transcribed in embryo. This study was to explore whether viral gene transcription is regulated by host genes. Embryos were produced by in vitro fertilization of hamster oocytes with human sperm containing the HBV genome. Total RNA extracted from test and control embryos were subjected to SMART-PCR, SSH, microarray hybridization, sequencing and BLAST analysis. Twenty-nine sequences showing significant identity to five human gene families were identified, with CSH2, EIF4G2, PCBD2, PSG4 and TTN selected to represent target genes. Using qRT-PCR, when CSH2 and PCBD2 (or EIF4G2, PSG4 and TTN) were silenced by RNAi, transcriptional levels of HBV s and x genes decreased (or increased). This is the first report that host genes participate in regulation of sperm-introduced HBV gene transcription in embryo, which is critical to prevent negative impact of HBV infection on early embryonic development.",

            "text": "Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Transmission of HBV through blood transfusion [1] , body fluids [2] , intrauterine infection [3] , cell, tissue and organ transplantation [4] , and others including hemodialysis units or intravenous drug injection or occupational exposure [5, 6] have been documented. In recent years some studies reported a true vertical transmission of HBV via germline and found that HBV has a negative effect on sperm motility in vivo and that couples in which the male is infected with HBV have a high risk of a low fertilization rate after in vitro fertilization (IVF) [7] . Huang et al. provided direct evidence that HBV DNA is able to integrate into the chromosomes of patient sperm, and that such HBV-carrying sperm can fertilize oocytes [8] . After fertilization, the sperm-introduced HBV c, s and x genes retain their functions of replication and expression in embryonic cells [9, 10] . Subsequently, some studies showed that the HBV S protein can cause a series of apoptotic events resulting in reduced sperm motility, loss of sperm membrane integrity, sperm dysfunction, decreased fertility, and sperm death [11] [12] [13] . Hu et al. collected 578 embryos from couples with at least one HBsAg seropositive partner, and found that HBV DNA was present in 14.4% (83/578) of embryos [14] . Thus the effects of HBV infection on human reproduction and early embryonic development and their mechanisms have attracted the attention of researchers. Sperm samples from healthy donors were divided into two groups: the test group was transfected with plasmid containing the full-length HBV genome (T), and the control group was non-transfected (C). Zona-free hamster ova were fertilized by transfected or non-transfected sperm to obtain two-cell embryos. Total RNA was extracted from T-and C-sperm-derived embryos, respectively and then subjected to SMART amplification, followed by SSH in both forward (T as tester) and reverse (C as tester) directions to enrich for up-regulated genes (T-C amplicon) or down-regulated genes (C-T amplicon).",

Clones with a fold change value greater than 2 or less than 0.5 when compared with the average Cy5/Cy3 intensity ratio, the differential expression of which was statistically significant, were selected for sequencing. For the acquired sequences, BLAST was used to search for sequences homologous to human genes in the GenBank nucleotide database. Of the sequences, five were selected as the target genes and their expression in two-cell embryos was confirmed by RT-PCR. B: Sperm in the test group was co-transfected with plasmid containing the full-length HBV genome and the target gene-specific shRNA/siRNA. Sperm in the control group was transfected with plasmid containing the full-length HBV genome alone. The transcription levels of HBV s and x genes in the two-cell embryos were assessed by real time qRT-PCR to identify whether the target genes participated in regulation of HBV gene expression. Same procedures listed above were Hepatitis B infection and disease pathogenesis are known to be influenced by a number of factors, including host genetic factors [15] . Many cellular proteins that possibly regulate HBV gene transcription in hepatocytes have been identified, including liver-enriched proteins, such as HNF1, HNF3, C/EBP, and KLF15, ubiquitous factors, such as Sp1, RFX1, NF-Y, and AP1, and members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, such as HNF4, RXRa, PPARa and COUP-TFs [16] [17] [18] [19] . Hepatotropism is a prominent feature of HBV infection, and virus infection appears to be restricted to hepatocytes [20] . Because sperm-derived embryos differ from hepatic cells, this study was undertaken to explore whether host genes participate in regulation of HBV gene transcription in embryonic cells, which is critical to reveal the regulation mechanism of viral gene transcription in these cells and to prevent the negative impact of HBV infection on early embryonic development.",

Three measures were taken to ensure reliable and accurate results (Fig. 1) . First, switching mechanism at 5 end of RNA template (SMART) amplification was employed because, unlike cells from other tissues, limited number of two-cell embryos made recovery of significant amounts of RNA very difficult. SMART amplification allows the synthesis of highquality cDNA for suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) from sub-microgram levels of RNA [26] . Combined with T-A cloning and bacterial amplification, we obtained sufficient subtraction products for array probe preparation, microarray assay and cDNA sequencing. Next, we combine SSH with microarray to obtain the cDNAs highly enriched for differentially expressed genes of both high and low abundance and greatly reduce tedious work for screening of subtraction libraries, as well as the likelihood of false-positive clones enriched via SSH [27] . Finally, we silenced the target genes and a control gene by RNA interference (RNAi) to detect effects of the silencing of these genes on transcriptional level of HBV genes to determine whether host genes participate in regulation of HBV gene transcription.",

Oligonucleotides are short DNA or RNA molecules, of which siRNA and shRNA are central to RNAi. It has been demon-strated that hamster and human sperm have a strong tendency to interact with exogenous DNA and are able to transfer DNA to oocytes [37] . Zhang et al. injected plasmid RNAi-Ready-pSIREN-RetroQ-ZsGreen, which was constructed for interrupting the Zfx gene, into testis in the test group mice, and then the male mice were mated individually with females, resulting in 78.75 \u00b1 7.50% of the male offspring, significantly higher than the offspring derived from the control groups (p < 0.01), suggesting that RNAi could be as a tool to control the sex ratio of mouse offspring by interrupting Zfx/Zfy genes in sperm cells [38] . In the current study, the two-cell embryos derived from sperm co-transfected with plasmids containing the full-length HBV genome and gene-specific shRNA/siRNA for interrupting the target genes were as the test group, and those derived from sperm transfected with plasmid containing the full-length Table 4 Effects of the non-interfering scrambled oligonucleotides on transcriptional levels of HBV S and X genes in two-cell embryos. Each sperm sample from a donor was divided into two groups: a test group (T), which was co-transfected with plasmids containing the full-length HBV genome and a non-interfering scrambled oligonucleotide (NISO); and a control group (C), which was transfected with plasmid containing the full-length HBV genome alone. The data were presented as a fold change value (FCV) in transcription of S and X genes in the test group normalized to internal control gene (GAPDH) and relative to those in the control group. Individual data were converted to a linear form using 2 \u2212Ct calculation [35] and then subjected to a paired-sample t-test using 16.0 software to determine a significant difference in average transcriptional levels of S and X genes between the test and control groups.

            "text": "We found that CSH2, PCBD2, EIF4G2, PSG4 and TTN to be involved in transcriptional regulation of HBV s and x genes in two-cell embryos. The protein encoded by CSH2 is a member of the somatotropin/prolactin family of hormones and plays an important role in growth control [39] . PCBD2 is a protein coding gene and associated with tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis [39] . Silencing of CSH2 and PCBD2 by RNAi decreased the levels of s and x gene transcription in two-cell embryos, indicating that both genes up-regulated transcription of s and x genes. The protein encoded by EIF4G2 is a subunit of EIF4F, a cap binding protein complex that mediates translation initiation by specific recognition [39] . PSG4 is a member of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family and may play a role in regulation of the innate immune system [39] . TTN encodes a large abundant protein that is a key component in the assembly and functioning of vertebrate striated muscles, and in non-muscle cells, seems to play a role in chromosome condensation and chromosome segregation during mitosis [39] . When EIF4G2, PSG4 and TTN were silenced by RNAi, the transcriptional levels of s and x genes in two-cell embryos increased, suggesting that these genes down-regulate s and x gene transcription. These results suggest that certain host genes participate in regulating HBV gene transcription in two-cell embryos. However, the interplay between the virus and host cells is complex, and it remains largely unknown how these genes interact with each other or act independently to allow differential transcription of HBV genes. Some clues may help in understanding their interaction. First, certain previously identified host HBV-regulatory genes share high similarity in function and signaling pathways with genes (identified herein) that regulate HBV gene transcription. For example, Sp1 is a ubiquitous factor that binds to GC-rich motifs in many promoters, can regulate transcription of HBV genes [16, 17] , and is involved in many cellular processes, including cell differentiation, growth, and apoptosis. The protein encoded by CSH2 also plays an important role in growth control and provides avenues for developmental regulation and tissue specificity. Both genes function in the prolactin signaling pathway, suggesting possible regulation of HBV gene transcription by a similar mechanism. Next, some host genes might indirectly participate in regulating HBV gene transcription through general activation of transcription regulators or factors. For example, HNF1 is a liver-enriched transcription factor that can regulate transcription of HBV genes [16, 17] . PCBD2, identified herein, regulates dimerization of HNF1\u2423 and enhance its transcriptional activity. Finally, our identified genes might directly contribute to regulation of HBV gene expression. For example, EIF4G2, besides down-regulating transcription of s and x genes, might repress viral RNA translation by forming translationally inactive complexes [39] .",

Human embryonic genome activation (EGA) occurs at the 4-8 cell stage [40, 41] , why host genes can regulate HBV gene expression in two-cell embryos? Some studies offered the useful clues, which may help shed light on this question. First, it has been demonstrated that EGA in mouse occurs at the two-cell stage, which is controlled by maternally deposited RNAs and proteins. Yu et al. identified lately that oocyte-expressed yes-associated protein is a key activator of EGA in mouse [42] . In the current study, the two-cell embryos were produced by IVF of zona-free golden hamster oocyte with human sperm. EGA in golden hamster also occurs at the two-cell stage [43] , whether certain activator (s) deposited in golden hamster oocyte activate human genome? Next, in development of human preimplantation embryo, there are four unique embryonic stagespecific patterns (ESSPs) of gene expression [44] . ESSP1 (maternally inherited oocyte mRNAs) were expressed at high levels at the zygote stage and declined during development to the blastocyst stage. ESSP2 includes embryonic-activated genes, first transcribed at approximately the 8-cell stage. ESSP3 comprises genes not expressed until the blastocyst stage. ESSP4 includes persistent transcripts that maintained stable expression from the zygote to blastocyst stages [41] . It is unknown whether the target genes identified in the current study are included in ESSP4? Undoubtedly, clarification of these questions would explore many mysteries in early embryonic development.",

Moreover, outcome of HBV infection is markedly heterogeneous, varying from acute asymptomatic self-limiting infection to fulminant hepatic failure or to decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It has been recognized that host genetic background influences the outcome of viral hepatitis infection [45] . In the current study, we found that some host genes upregulate or downregulate transcription of s and x genes. Can we assume that these host genes together function to maintain homeostasis?

Certain factors that may contribute to abnormal development before EGA include inherited genetic mutations, aneuploidy, environmental insult to germ cells, events during fertilization and sperm-related factors [41] . In our previous study, it was detected that HBV infection induces various chromosomal abnormalities in patient sperm, including aneuploidy, acentric fragment and deletion, ring chromo-some, triradial, dicentric chromosome and pulverization [8] . Sperm with these chromosomal abnormalities can achieve normal fertilization and introduce these aberrations into the embryo, which may increase the risk of abortion, stillbirth, or birth defects [8] . In a recent clinical literature, HBV mRNA was found in abandoned IVF embryos of HBV-infected fathers, which confirmed that HBV could not only enter early cleavage embryos via sperm but also replicate in embryos, resulting in early abortion [47] .

RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR were performed to confirm transcription of the target genes (CSH2, EIF4G2, PCBD2, PSG4 and TTN) in embryonic cells and to determine whether they regulate transcription of HBV s and x genes, respectively. ESRRG that was uncorrelated to target genes was chosen as control. Both \u02c7-actin and GAPDH were used as the internal controls for RT-PCR and real-time qRT-PCR assays, respectively[33].",
