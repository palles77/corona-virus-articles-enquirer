Because of the harm that parasites can inflict on man and domesticated animals, which can be expressed as economic loss, many parasites become pests. In natural ecosystems, parasites contribute to the prevention of continuous exponential growth of populations and, therefore, they also need to be conserved. The exotic pet trade may result in translocation of exotic species together with their microparasites and macroparasites, potentiating a risk of transmission of exotic diseases to native fauna and to humans. Within this context we need to increase our knowledge of parasites and parasitic diseases of wildlife. Prevention seems to be the choice for managing parasite exposure. This may be achieved through educational programs that refocused on discouraging people to import exotic pets, together with stronger legislative measures to control wildlife trade.",

Macroparasites (e.g., helminths, arthropods, other metazoans) are large parasites that normally do not reproduce themselves within the host, show much longer generation times than microparasites, do not induce a durable immunity, have stable populations, and usually are responsible for endemic diseases. 11 According to the location of the parasite on or within its host, we can distinguish between: 1) ectoparasites, which are in direct contact with the outside, as well as with its propagules; 2) mesoparasites, which are located in an organ with direct communication with the exterior; and 3) endoparasites, which are in a cell, tissue, or organ without direct contact with the outside, making the release of their propagules more problematic. 12 All of these parasites are at the same trophic level, in contrast to the structuring of hyperparasites, which parasitize other parasites.",

Vertical transmission can be defined as the direct transmission or infection from a host to its offspring (e.g., direct contact, transplacentally, transo-varially, lactation). Complementing vertical transmission is horizontal transmission, which includes the remaining modes of transmission, both direct and indirect, of parasites between host individuals. The mode of transmission used by a parasite is linked to its virulence and host specificity.

Today this concept is very relevant because of the intercontinental transport and economic interchange between distant regions (in a biogeographic sense) and, therefore, we can consider the Earth as a global home for most pathogens and infectious diseases. This global pool of parasite species is organized at a regional level in diverse metacommunities, which are distributed in large biogeographic regions as continents or subcontinents. At a local level, parasite communities are reorganized because of the existence of several \"filters\" (e.g., historic, cultural, environmental) that affect the dispersion of parasites.

            "text": "Because of their host dependence, the real biologic individuality of parasites has been questioned. 14 These authors consider the host-parasite duo as a \"whole.\" This system is also known as a \"superorganism,\" which possesses a \"supergenome\" 2 and receives resources from the outside, both partners being in competition for these resources. Then, an important consequence arises: each species' genome is ex-pressed within the context of the other species' phenotype. The concept of the \"extended phenotype\" 15 emphasizes that phenotypes of hosts and parasites result from interactions between the 2 genomes. However, it is also important to consider that host and parasite genotypes share control of the epidemiologic parameters of their relationship. 16 The interaction between the host and the parasite is characterized by its asymmetry. 2 The host may reach its maximum fitness without the parasite, whereas the parasite without the host has no fitness at all. The fitness of a parasitized host is determined by various factors (e.g., availability of resources, competition). The resulting parasite-induced loss of host fitness (because of the damage caused and the competition for part of the resources used by the host) is defined as virulence, 17 which does not mean the same as pathogenicity. The life of the parasite is not of interest to the host, but the host's life is of interest to the parasite because the former is used as a habitat and as a vehicle. This second asymmetry has been used to define the concept of the cost of virulence. As a component of the parasite's fitness, virulence may also be used as a measure or index of the parasite survival within the host. 18 Parasite fitness is determined by the success of its transmission to new hosts. Therefore, the decrease of host fitness induces a concomitant decrease in parasite fitness, which needs to balance the costs and benefits associated with its virulence. The resulting self-limitation of virulence leads to the concept of optimal virulence. Host resistance has also been defined as virulence against the parasite, or host-mediated loss of fitness in the parasite, resulting in changes in its fecundity, density, and/or mortality. 2 The cost of resistance is expressed in terms of metabolic expense for the host and can vary throughout the host's lifespan. 19 Certain parasites can infect their hosts vertically and horizontally. These 2 routes differ greatly in the way the parasite is transmitted and infects a new host, and infections resulting from each route may thus differ in terms of both host and parasite fitness. Hosts and parasites can have varied reactions to different routes of infection, which suggests that ecologic factors can shape the evolution of host and parasite life histories and, consequently, the evolution of virulence. 20",

The immediate consequences of parasitic disease may also be important at the population level, 36 as a density-dependent factor preventing continuous exponential growth of host population. 37, 38 Also, the effects of an infectious disease on one particular host species may have an impact on other species by means of direct or indirect interactions. 39 The cost to both humans and domesticated animals of becoming parasitized is, in terms of human misery and economic loss, incalculable. 40 Between 400 and 900 million people become infected with Plasmodium spp. each year, and more than 2 million, mainly children from sub-Saharan Africa, die of malaria. 4, 41 As another example, economic losses in livestock caused by Fasciola spp. worldwide are estimated at US $2 billion per annum. 42 Recently, the role of pets as reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (microparasites) has been stressed. 43 In this context, parasites are usually considered as pests, and the risk of associating and confounding a particular way of life with a status arises 44 (see Pizzi, this issue).",

Factors involved in the current trend of such diseases are related to the use of improved diagnostic methods, human behavior, modifications of natural habitats, changes in agricultural practices, consumption of exotic foods, development of ecotourism, and globalization of trade. 45 The trade in live wildlife involves capture from the wild and the sale of billions of animals of many species each year. This includes the exotic pet trade, which deals with an increasing range of wild animal species, from invertebrates to mammals. Many of these animals have zoonotic potential and may harbor some important diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), monkey pox, rabies, hantavirosis, tularaemia, avian chlamydiosis, yersiniosis, alveolar echinococcosis, arthropod-borne encephalitis, or tick-borne diseases. These, among others, can be spread through contact with exotic pets. 46, 47 This risk may be increased if the animals are kept in captivity before arrival at their destination. 23 Scratches and bites are important, if not the main, mechanisms of disease transmission, but other infections may be transmitted via cutaneous, mucous, digestive, or respiratory routes, and by direct contact with pet animals, their excreta, or the use of different vectors. 48 Moreover, certain people, such as small children, pregnant women, and immunodeficient patients are considered to be population sectors with a high risk of becoming infected by such diseases. 48, 49 A recent review 50 addressed the contamination of coastal marine environments with massive amounts of feces from people, their pets, and domesticated animals. This involves important zoonotic protists, such as Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Toxoplasma spp. These encysted parasites may be filtered and concentrated by shellfish, which are eaten by humans and marine mammals.",

However, the Council on Public Health and Regulatory Veterinary Medicine argued that the American Veterinary Medical Association needs an immediate and unambiguous policy proscribing the keeping of any wild animal as a pet. 54",

Conventional diagnostic methods have limitations that reflect a limited knowledge of epide-miology, ecology, and biology of many parasitic diseases of exotic pets. 55 Polymerase chain reactionbased techniques have become simple, fast, and reliable and are available at most veterinary diagnostic laboratories. These techniques allow the detection of the DNA of different parasites from various tissue samples or biologic samples and, further, its characterization of the organism to a specific level. 55, 56 Importantly, the versatility of these molecular methods is such that it permits a search for genetic diversity at infraspecific level and to infer phylogenetic relationships between different parasites, even at a supraspecific level. This work needs to be complemented with the development of specific treatments for such parasitic diseases. Long-term monitoring of these parasite infections may help us to understand better which factors affect their epidemiology. The development of specific vaccines, both for humans and for pets, may become the keystone for preventing the spread of such diseases. 57 Despite these advances, the research may be inadequate if international wildlife trade continues to increase year by year, with a concomitant increase in the range of wild species that are sold as pets. Also, the breeding and rearing of exotic pet animals by some owners are gaining popularity in many countries of the world. 53 These trends emphasize the need to introduce educational programs directed toward discouraging people from buying exotic pets if the importation and spread of exotic parasitic diseases are to be prevented or reduced. 48 Such measures must be reinforced with legislative action aimed at controlling the international wildlife trade, regulate the keeping of wildlife as pets, preventing the release into the wild of these animals, and restricting the acquisition of an exotic pet to those with appropriate training and experience. 58 Legislative measures need international coordination and cooperation if the goals are to be achieved.",
