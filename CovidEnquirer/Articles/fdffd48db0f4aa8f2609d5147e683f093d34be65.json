Sectioning of the villus-crypt unit in a cryostat enabled direct comparison of the distribution of lactase and sucrase enzyme activities in the adult rat.

The data indicate that unlike sucrase activity, which is expressed maximally in enterocytes along the entire villus, maximal lactase activity is not attained until midvillus.

Since the absolute activity of lactase is low compared to sucrase both in the human\" and rat,\" a comparable loss of both enzymes after mucosal injury may reduce lactase activity below a critical threshold to allow for physiologic hydrolysis of dietary lactose. However, the decrease in the ratio of lactase to suerase activity in small bowel biopsies of patients who are lactose intolerant after acute mucosal injury indicates a higher vulnerability of lactase compared to sucrase.13-'5 By studying incorporation and turnover of radiolabeled amino acids, James et al. have shown that microvillus proteins do not have a uniform rate of turnover.20 Alpers showed that the largest molecular weight proteins (including the disaccharidases) have the fastest rate of turnover.2l Therefore, both synthesis and degradation of disaccharidases are taking place along the entire length of the villus crypt! Differences in location where synthesis begins, ot differences in the rate of turnover of lactase and suerase might lead to a difference in enzyme distribution along the villus-crypt unit. Differences in localization of enzyme activity in turn might help explain the decrease in the ratio of lactase to sucrase (0), and acid &alactosidase (A) along the villus-crypt unit. Abcissa depicts \"idealized villus-crypt unit\" as explained in the Methods section, with 100% representing the top-most part of the villus and 0% the bottom-most part of the crypt. Histologic examination of sections revealed villi to make up 65%; mixed villus crypt, 20%; and crypt, 15% of the total villus-crypt height. Because of very low protein in homogenates from apical 10% of villus crypt, the amount of absorbance measured by spectrophotometer was very low both for lactase and sucrase, and. therefore, enzyme activity was not considered accurate for presentation.",

(b) The possibility of an inhibitor of enzyme activity in lower sections of the villus crypt was studied by combining homogenates of equal protein concentration from apical villus and lower villus-mixed crypt sections. The resulting activity for both lactase and sucrase approximated the arithmetic mean activity calculated to result from such a mixing.

The pH optimum for lactase activity at all heights was between 5.0 and 6.0. In the presence of PCMB, all activity at pH 3.5 was abolished.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of specific lactase, sucrase, and acid /&galactosidase activity along the villus-crypt unit. The general pattern of distribution of activity agrees with previous reports.'-' The mean L/S ratios at different heights of the villus crypt are plotted in Figure 2 . Since both enzyme assays were performed on the same homogenate, the L/S ratio is independent of how enzyme activity is expressed. The results show that there is a definite gradient of increasing L/S ratio in going from crypt to apical villus. Using one-way analysis of variance, the ratio in lower villus is significantly less than in apical and midvillus ( Table 1 ). The reason for this increase in L/S ratio can be seen if the specific activity of each enzyme is expressed as a percent of the maximal specific activity along a particular villuscrypt unit (Figure 3 ). Sucrase reaches maximal activity in enterocytes along the upper 70%-75% of the villus-crypt height, whereas lactase does not peak until the top 45%-50%.

Histologic studies in acute viral gastroenteritis have shown blunting of villus height and disorganization of surface epithelial cells.3*~32 In the event of apical destruction of villus cells carrying lactase activity, the remaining activity in cells in the mid to lower levels of the villus may be below critical threshold to allow for physiologic hydrolysis of lactose. It is important to remember that total jejunal lactase activity is between one-fifth (unpublished from our laboratory) and one-tenth\" that of sucrase activity in the adult rat. The more even distribution of sucrase along the crypt-villus unit would then explain the usual normal ability to absorb sucrose in acute gastroenteritis.",

Based on results of the present experiment, lactase activity, which is more dependent on cell maturity than sucrase, would be primarily affected by reparative events occurring after infection.",
