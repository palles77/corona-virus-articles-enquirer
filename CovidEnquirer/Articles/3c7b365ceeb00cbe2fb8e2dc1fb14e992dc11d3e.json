Viroporins are a growing family of viral proteins able to enhance membrane permeability, promoting virus budding. Initially, the MHV E gene was inducibly expressed in Escherichia coli cells, leading to the arrest of bacterial growth, cell lysis and permeabilization to different compounds. Thus, exit of labeled nucleotides from E. coli cells to the cytoplasm was apparent upon expression of MHV E. In addition, enhanced entry of the antibiotic hygromycin B occurred at levels comparable to those observed with the viroporin 6K from Sindbis virus. Mammalian cells are also readily permeabilized by the expression of MHV E protein. Finally, brefeldin A powerfully blocks the viroporin activity of the E protein in BHK cells, suggesting that an intact vesicular system is necessary for this coronavirus to permeabilize mammalian cells.",

            "text": "Injury to the cellular plasma membrane is a common feature observed with the vast majority of animal viruses. Alterations of membrane permeability constitute part of the strategy to facilitate the release of virions from infected cells [1] . A number of viral proteins alter membrane functioning of host cells: (i) viral glycoproteins, some of them endowed with membrane fusion activity [2] ; (ii) viral proteases, such as HIV-1 PR [3] ; and (iii) a group of proteins known as viroporins. These proteins share a number of features in their structure and function. Viroporins are integral membrane proteins which vary in size from about 50-120 aminoacids, possessing at least one hydrophobic stretch able to form an amphipatic a-helix. There also may be a second hydrophobic domain integrated into membranes. A major activity of viroporins is to act at late stages of the viral cycle promoting the exit of new virus particles from the cell [4] . Recently, another domain in the alphavirus 6K protein con-sisting of two interfacial motifs at the N-terminal end, rich in aromatic residues, has been described. This motif is important both for virus budding and to enhance membrane permeability [5] .",

            "text": "Viroporins interact with membranes to increase permeability to ions and other small molecules [1, 4] . After their insertion into membranes, viroporins tend to oligomerize to create a hydrophilic pore [6] [7] [8] [9] . Many viroporins are not required for viral replication, although their presence significantly increases the formation of the virus particles, but they are excluded from them [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In the last few years, several viral proteins have been assigned to the viroporin family [4] . Following this trend, we have now analyzed the viroporin activity of the E protein from murine hepatitis virus (MHV). MHV is an enveloped, positive-strand RNA coronavirus that belongs to the order Nidovirales [16, 17] . The MHV envelope contains three integral proteins: the spike protein (S), the membrane glycoprotein (M) and the E protein. Virus budding takes place at intracellular membranes [18, 19] . The M protein is the most abundant envelope component. It contains three membrane-spanning domains and plays essential roles in virus morphogenesis, while E is the minor protein component of the virion. E is a short and hydrophobic protein of 83 amino acids that localizes at the budding compartment with its C-terminal hydrophilic region extending into the cellular cytoplasm or the virion interior. It contains a large hydrophobic N-terminal region, but its orientation and topology are not yet well defined. The coronavirus E protein may span either side of the membrane, although recent evidence suggests that a tag at the N-terminus is exposed at the cytoplasm [20, 21] . The E gene is not essential for viral replication, but is required for efficient virus budding and morphogenesis [22] . The expression of M and E proteins from several coronaviruses induces the production of virus-like particles (VLPs), while the sole expression of the E protein promotes the release of membrane vesicles akin to those observed in MHV-infected cells [23, 24] . In addition, the E protein also induces apoptosis [25] . More recently, it was described that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) E protein has the ability to form pores in artificial membranes, as well as to permeabilize bacterial cells after its expression [26, 27] . Our present findings agree well with these reports and further reveal the capacity of the MHV E protein to permeabilize E. coli and mammalian cells, supporting the idea that the E protein from different coronaviruses is endowed with viroporin activity. This work was initially presented at the 2nd European Congress of Virology Eurovirology 2004 (Madrid, Spain).",

To address this question, two assays were carried out: (i) the release of radioactivity from [ 3 H] uridine-preloaded cells; (ii) the entry of the non-permeant translation inhibitor hygromycin B (HB) [5, 31, 32] . The release of [ 3 H] uridine was first observed at 30 min of induction and increased to significant amounts at 90 min after induction of either E or 6K proteins (Fig. 1B) . The release of labeled uridine was a bit lower with E protein as compared to 6K. Inhibition of host translation by HB entry is only detected in cells whose membrane permeability has been modified, but not in cells in which the membrane remains intact [34] . The expression of both proteins E and 6K was assayed by bacterial labeling with [ 35 S] Met/Cys. Addition of IPTG and rifampicin induced the expression of a protein migrating with the expected mobility for E protein (9.66 kDa) (Fig. 1C) . Synthesis of the E protein takes place at higher levels than the SV 6K protein, and it was detected after more than 150 min post-induction (m.p.i.) (data not shown). By contrast, synthesis of SV 6K is very toxic in the presence of lysozime in such a way that it was not observed from 60 min post-induction (Fig. 1C, line c) . These results indicate that the E protein is less toxic than SV 6K for bacterial cells. Fig. 1C shows that translation in E. coli cells that express the E protein was deeply inhibited by HB at 30 min after induction, and only small amounts of E protein synthesis (line b) could be observed at 30 and 60 m.p.i. in the presence of HB (14% and 11% E protein synthesis, respectively). Thus, the permeabilizing ability of E protein is similar to that found with 6K.",

BFA treatment did not decrease protein synthesis in HB-treated cells as compared to untreated cells. On the other hand, BFA by itself is not able to induce membrane permeabilization to HB in BHK cells (Fig. 2C) [13] . In agreement with Raamsman et al., electron microscopic studies of E-expressing BHK cells revealed that the characteristic curvated membranous structures induced by E were insensitive to BFA treatment (data not shown).

These proteins, known as viroporins, are able to form hydrophilic pores in biological membranes and play an essential role in virus budding [1] . The findings reported in this work support the idea that the MHV E protein modifies membrane permeability in both E. coli and mammalian cells. These results agree well with recent reports on the ability of SARS-CoV E protein to open pores in artificial membranes as well as to enhance permeability in bacterial cells [26, 27] . Despite the low aminoacid sequence homology between the E proteins from MHV and SARS, their functionality could be similar [38] . Therefore, the coronavirus E protein can now be classified also as a member of the viroporin family. So far the group of viroporins include: poliovirus 2B, 2BC and 3A, coxsackievirus 2B, togavirus 6K protein, HIV-1 Vpu, human respiratory syncitial virus SH, influenza A M2, avian reovirus p10, hepatitis C virus p7, bovine ephemeral fever virus alpha p10, hepatitis A virus 2B and 2BC, infectious bursitis virus VP5, japanese encephalitis virus NS proteins, bluetongue virus NS3 and the E protein from SARS-CoV [4, 26, [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] .",

            "text": "The exact mechanism by which viroporins alter the permeability of the plasma membrane is as yet unknown. Two possibilities to account for their action can be put forward: direct permeabilization by the viroporin located at the plasma membrane, or an indirect mechanism that involves the opening of a cellular pore at the plasma membrane triggered by the viroporin placed at the intracellular membrane. In favour of the first possibility is the fact that viroporins open hydrophilic pores in artificial membranes of a size similar to that observed in the infected cells [8, 9, 27, [44] [45] [46] . Moreover, BFA interferes with viroporin activity, including MHV E protein as shown in this work [13, 43, [47] [48] [49] . It is possible that BFA blocks the trafficking of E protein from the ER to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, the E protein may remain at an intracellular compartment, provoking a signal that travels through the vesicular system to open a cellular pore. Two additional lines of evidence also support the idea that viroporins themselves can reach the plasma membrane. One of them is that the expression of some viroporins induces the formation of vesicles from the plasma membrane that contain the viroporin [24] . In addition, the budding of some animal viruses from the plasma membrane is greatly enhanced by the expression of the corresponding viroporin. However, it is puzzling that the greater proportion of most viroporins analyzed remains at intracellular membranes, without little or no sign of their presence at the plasma membrane. One reason for this behaviour is that the low proportion of viroporin at the external membrane makes it almost undetectable. Moreover, it may also be that soon after viroporin arrival to the plasma membrane, vesicles are secreted to the culture medium.",

Thus, permeation to HB is exerted at the plasma membrane, but additional effects at intracellular membranes cannot be ruled out. Already some viroporins like rotavirus NSP4, poliovirus 2BC and coxsackie virus 2B have been found to be capable of disrupting Ca 2+ homeostasis from ER [50] [51] [52] . The mobilization of calcium by NSP4 involves phospholipase C activation and inositol trisphosphate production [53] . The alteration of subcellular ion homeostasis could trigger an internal signal that would travel through the secretory pathway to finally act on cellular channels or pores as well as on phospholipases to disrupt the plasma membrane integrity. The expression of several small integral membrane proteins of both viral and cellular origin, at least in the oocytes of Xenopus laevis, is capable of regulating some channels endogenous to the host cell [54] . So far, the existence of interactions between the E and cellular proteins has not been described. A viroporin, HIV-1 Vpu, was found to interact and alter the normal function of the widely expressed cellular two-pore K + channel TASK-1 [55] . The E protein abundantly localizes in membranes of intermediate compartment where it could be modifying the permeability leading to the disruption of ion gradients at intracellular organelles. Further studies would be necessary to gain greater insight into the molecular mode of action of the different viroporins thus far described.",
