We investigate whether the improvement of business conditions enhances financial performance of tourism firms and whether financial success of tourism firms matters to business development. In general, cointegration test results support a long-run equilibrium relationship between the two variables, business conditions and financial performance of tourism firms, and Granger causality test results show that these two factors reinforce each other in both China and Taiwan. This study therefore documents significant contributions of financial success of tourism firms to business development and strengthening of financial performance of tourism firms by business conditions. Some managerial implications are also discussed. r",

A positive economic impact usually leads to an increase in sales and hence income (and earnings), which in turn can improve the performance of business firms. On the other hand, corporate earnings and dividends are most likely to decrease if business conditions are expected to deteriorate. This reduction in expected earnings and dividends will in turn cause a decrease in the stock price or the firm's performance (Harvey, 1991 ).

Results based on this event study shows that the announcement has a positive effect on the performance of its chain. Chen and Bin (2001) examine the effect of legislation events on stock performance of US casino gaming firms. They find that different types of casino companies show different reactions to gaming legislation announcements. Chen, Jang, and Kim (2006) , using the event study approach, test the effect of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 on Taiwan hotel stock prices. They detect a significantly negative mean abnormal return in Taiwan hotel stocks on and after the day of the SARS outbreak. Choi, Olsen, Kwansa, and Tse (1999) develop a model to capture business cycle for the US hotel industry, which offers useful guidelines for practitioners and researchers in the hotel industry. Aimed to cover hotel activities as broadly as possible, the developed hotel industry cycle model illustrates the magnitude of growth in the US hotel industry. They find that the hotel industry experienced high growth every 4 or 5 years over a 28-year period from 1966 to 1993. Specifically, the average contraction period is about 2 years, while the average expansion period is about 3 years. They further show that the hotel industry leads general business cycle peaks by approximately 0.75 years on average and leads troughs in the general business cycle by an average of 0.5 years.",

            "text": "Several papers examine stock valuation and risk of hotel and restaurant firms. Rushmore (1992) investigates seven stock valuation techniques used for the acquisition and appraisal of hotels in the US and discusses the strength and weakness of each technique. Borde (1998) uses the ordinary least square (OLS) regression to test the risk diversity across restaurants in the US He illustrates that the investment risk of restaurant companies can be predicted by some financial characteristics such as liquidity, dividend-payout ratio, operating returns, and growth opportunities. Elgonemy (2000) studies the pricing of US lodging stocks. He argues that the traditional valuation measures are obsolete in the new economy. Sheel and Nagpal (2000) analyze a long-run equity performance of acquiring firms in the US hospitality industry. Negative performance of equity value of acquiring hospitality firms is evidenced in their study over the period of 1980-2000. Gu and Kim (2002) , following Borde (1998) , re-examine determinants of systematic risk of US restaurant firms. They, using data covering a time period from 1996 to 1999, report that systematic risk is negatively correlated with asset turnover but positively correlated with quick ratio for restaurants. Kim and Gu (2003) investigate the risk-adjusted performance of three restaurant sectors, full-service, economy/buffet, and fast-food restaurants. Their finding suggests that in the US, fast-food restaurants perform the best, followed by full-service restaurants and economy/ buffet restaurants. However, the performance of all three sectors is inferior to that of the market portfolio. Jeon et al. (2004) examine the impact of the persistence in abnormal earnings on book value of equity and earnings. They find that the persistence in abnormal earnings is higher for hotels than for manufacturing companies. Chen (2006b) tests the mean reversion behavior of tourism stock prices towards their fundamental values, namely earnings and dividend per share. The results indicate that earnings per share serve as a better proxy than dividends per share for fundamental values of tourism stock prices. Moreover, while tourism stock prices diverge away from their fundamental values from time to time, there exists an error correction mechanism in the market that allows tourism stock prices to revert their mean towards their fundamental values. Barrows and Naka (1994) , Chen, Kim, and Kim (2005) and Chen (2006a) investigate the impact of economic forces on hospitality stock returns. Barrows and Naka (1994) use the OLS regression to assess the effect of five selected macroeconomic variables on stock returns of US hospitality firms. They demonstrate that growth rates of money supply and domestic consumption have positive effects on hotel stock returns and expected inflation rate has a negative impact on hotel stock returns. Chen et al., (2005) examine the influences of both economic and non-economic forces on hotel stock returns in Taiwan. Empirical results show that two economic variables, money supply and unemployment rate, significantly affect hotel stock returns. Moreover, non-macroeconomic factors, namely presidential elections, the 9/21 earthquake, the outbreak of SARS, sports mega-events, the Asian financial crisis, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, have significant effects on hotel stock returns. Chen (2006a) extends the examination of the relationship between macro and non-macro explanatory variables and hotel stock returns to the emerging stock market of China. In consideration of a tremendous growth of tourism in China, Chen includes growth rate of total foreign tourist arrivals, in conjunction with other commonly used macroeconomic variables, as another critical macro factor that may affect Chinese hotel stock returns, in his study. Evidence shows that Chinese hotel stock returns are more sensitive to general macro variables. The impact of growth rate of tourist arrivals is positive but not significant. Several non-macro forces, financial crises, natural disas-ters, political events, sports mega-events, terrorist attacks and wars, are also found to be significant to Chinese hotel stock returns.",

One exception is that the null hypothesis is rejected for both level and first difference of quarterly LSPI of the Huatian hotel in China. In other words, quarterly LSPI of the Huatian hotel is I(0) and all other time-series data of LIP, LGDP, and LSPI are I\u00f01\u00de for their levels; however, all variables are I(0) for their first differences.

We further detect that gross domestic product plays a more critical role than industrial production in forecasting variance of financial performance of the tourism group as a whole in both China and Taiwan the manufacturing sector, whereas gross domestic product covers both manufacturing and other service sectors. Thus, this finding suggests that overall financial performance of the tourism industry has close links to not only the manufacturing sector but also other service sectors. Empirical findings in this study offer valuable information for tourism business managers and government tourism policymakers. Causality test results can help the government set priorities regarding where and how to allocate limited resources to improve overall business conditions. If one-way causality runs from tourism firms' financial performance to business conditions, more resources should be allocated to the tourism industry than to other sectors. If one-way causality from business conditions to tourism firms' financial performance is detected, the government should allocate resources to leading industries so that the overall economy will be improved, which would in turn boost the tourism industry. Resources should be equally allocated to tourism and other major industries if a two-way causality exists between the two variables. On the other hand, using enthusiastic tourism promotion or a strategic plan to improve the tourism industry and hence the overall economy will not be as effective as it is generally assumed, if there is no causality between business conditions and financial performance of tourism firms.",

For example, after the Chinese Ministry of Health first reported that there had been 300 cases of SARS on February 11, 2003, the number of visitors to China decreased from 8,484,300 in January to 7,376,000 in February (a 6.08% drop), to 5,649,200 in April (a 17.66% drop since January), and to 5,436,000 in May (a total of 35.93% drop in four months). Chen (2006a) also reports that the SARS outbreak has a significantly negative impact on hotel stock returns in China. For the case of Taiwan, after the SARS outbreak on April 22, 2003, the number of visitors to Taiwan significantly dropped from 258,023 in March to 110,632 in April (a 57% drop) and to 40,250 in May (an 84% drop in 2 months). The China Post (2003) reported that the tourism-related industries such as hotels, restaurants, and theme parks were the most severely affected groups by the outbreak of SARS in Taiwan. The severe, negative impact of the SARS outbreak on the tourism industry was well reflected on its financial performance (stock prices). As shown in Fig. 5 , the tourism industry, among all industries, experienced the highest monthly percentage drop in the share price index in the month after the SARS outbreak. Chen et al., (2005) further shows that SARS outbreak has much more damaging impact than any other non-macro events, such as the earthquake, wars, financial crisis, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks, on hotel stock returns in Taiwan. Moreover, Waugh (2003) estimates that Taiwanese economic growth in 2003 was cut by SARS by 0.5%. Given the finding that business expansion and financial success of tourism firms significantly reinforce each other in China and Taiwan, the local government authority should equally allocate resources to tourism and other major industries to enhance the tourism industry and the overall economy.",

The announcement was a momentous occasion for China. It is equivalently significant to China's inbound tourism industry. Over the years, Olympics host cities and countries have organized various forms of tourism promotion in association with the Games. The Games would have a significantly positive impact on the tourism industry and, consequently, on the overall business climate and the national economy. However, Chen (2006a) finds that the announcement of the 2008 Beijing Olympics has a negative impact on hotel stock returns in China. Thus, the Chinese government and tourism authorities need to cautiously prepare for the Games, instead of expecting that a beneficial influence of the Olympics on both the tourism industry and overall economy would just happen automatically. Chen et al. (2005) report that international sports megaevents, such as the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2002 Japan/ Korea World Cup, have a negative impact on hotel stock returns in Taiwan. As they noted, the negative impact of the Sydney Olympics is understandable, considering the geographical distance between the two nations. They also argue that Taiwan could have benefited from the 2002 Japan/Korea World Cup because of its proximity to Japan and South Korea and conclude that the negative effect might be attributed to the lack of sufficient efforts made to attract international visitors. Because evidence shows that financial success of tourism firms and business development promote each other in Taiwan and private tourism organizations and marketers should strive to take advantage of the 2008 Beijing Olympics in China. For shopping lovers, Taiwan can be regarded as an excellent stopover destination because it provides various eatery choices and products. If enthusiastic tourism promotion or activities can attract international tourists to make a trip to Taiwan during the 2008 Olympics game period, the financial performance of tourism firms and the industry as a whole would be positively influenced, which in turn can boost the overall economy.",
