We conclude that neutrophils, which are recruited in high numbers to inflammatory sites, also contribute to allergic inflammatory diseases through the activation of allergen-specific T cells.",

            "text": "Bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization in US infants. 1 Rhinovirus (RV) is the second most common cause of severe bronchiolitis (ie, bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization) following respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 1 RVs are RNA viruses consisting of more than 160 genotypes that are classified into 3 species (RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C). 2 RV-A and RV-C are more frequently found than RV-B in children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and wheezing illnesses. 3, 4 Emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay between viral infection, airway microbes, and host immune response in the pathobiology of ARI. Studies have shown that RV infection in children is associated with increased detection of pathogenic bacteria in the airways. 5, 6 Furthermore, detection of RV together with specific airway pathogens (eg, Moraxella catarrhalis) is associated with increased ARI and asthma symptoms. 6 Recently, RV-A and RV-C were reported to differentially associate with detection of pathogenic bacteria in school-age children. 7 However, no study has investigated the relationships between rhinovirus species and airway microbiota in infants, let alone infants with bronchiolitis. To address the knowledge gap, we examined the association between rhinovirus species and the nasopharyngeal airway microbiota determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in 774 infants with severe bronchiolitis.",

Nasopharyngeal samples were collected within 24 hours of hospitalization and stored at 2808C locally. These samples were processed and tested for 17 respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR and for microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, Tex). Singleplex real-time PCR was used to detect RV, and positive A B FIG 1. Between-virus difference in nasopharyngeal microbiota in infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. A, Between the 4 virus categories, the proportion of nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles differed. For example, compared with infants with RSV-only bronchiolitis, those with RV-A infection were more likely to have a Haemophilus-dominant, mixed, or Moraxella-dominant profile than a Streptococcus-dominant profile. Infants with RV-C infection were more likely to have a Moraxella-dominant profile. P values were derived from adjusted multinomial logistic regression model. Corresponding relative rate ratios are presented in Table I . *P < .05. B, Between the 4 virus categories, the distribution of relative abundance of 3 most common genera in the nasopharyngeal microbiota differed. Data are presented using violin plots, which are boxplots with a rotated kernel density plot on each side. P values adjusted for multiple comparisons are presented in Table E3 . specimens were further genotyped by using molecular typing assay at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, Wis). By using partitioning around medoids unsupervised clustering with the use of weighted UniFrac distance, 4 distinct nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles were derived as previously described. 8 In the current analysis, we grouped infants into 4 mutually exclusive virus categories: solo RSV (reference), RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C. We tested the association between these virus categories and nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles by constructing multinomial logistic regression model adjusting for 8 covariates. Data were analyzed using R version 3.4.4. Of 1016 enrolled infants, 774 were in 1 of the 4 prespecified virus categories (580 RSV-only, 91 RV-A, 12 RV-B, and 91 RV-C) and had high-quality microbiota data; they comprised the analytic sample. Overall, the median age was 2.9 months (interquartile range, 1.6-5.3), 60% were male, and 16% infants received intensive care therapy. Compared with infants with RSV-only, those with RV-A or RV-C were older and more likely to have previous breathing problems (P < .001; see Table E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).",

First, the study design precluded us from examining the relation between the temporal pattern of airway microbiota and respiratory health in children. To address this question, the cohort is currently being followed longitudinally for 61 years with serial examinations of microbiota. Second, the current study did not have healthy controls. However, the study aim was to determine the association of virus species with microbiota among infants with bronchiolitis. Finally, although the study cohort comprised a racially/ethnically diverse US sample of infants, we must generalize the inferences cautiously beyond infants with severe bronchiolitis. Regardless, our data are highly relevant for 130,000 US children hospitalized with bronchiolitis each year. 1 In summary, on the basis of this multicenter prospective cohort study of infants with severe bronchiolitis, we observed that compared with infants with RSV-only infection, infants with RV-A or RV-C infection had distinct nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles-for example, those with RV-C infection had a higher likelihood of Moraxella-dominant microbiota profile, whereas those with RV-A infection had a higher likelihood of Haemophilus-dominant profile. Although causal inferences remain premature, our data should advance research into delineating the complex interrelations between respiratory viruses, airway microbiome, and respiratory outcomes in children.",

Most attention on EGID has focused on eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). This increased focus on EoE is, in part, related to the agreed-upon diagnostic criteria for EoE. These consensus criteria are more straightforward than the limited, nonconsensus criteria of other EGIDs because the esophagus, unlike the rest of the gastrointestinal mucosa, is devoid of eosinophils under healthy normal conditions. Among EGIDs, there is relatively little information concerning eosinophilic colitis (EC), currently defined as a clinicopathologic disorder that primarily affects the colon with eosinophil-rich inflammation in the absence of known causes of eosinophilia. [1] [2] [3] [4] Even without agreed-upon diagnostic criteria for EC, previous studies have estimated its prevalence in adult and pediatric populations to be 1.5 to 2.4 per 100,000 individuals on the basis of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) coding. 5, 6 Herein, we aimed to (1) identify cases of colonic eosinophilia in a tertiary pediatric medical center; (2) determine associated diseases; and (3) estimate the prevalence of cases considered to be EC in the hospital and geographic populations.",

In the EMR approach, a computer script was generated to identify all records since 2009 with ICD-9/10 codes for EC (558.42; K52.82), whereas in the pathology database search, specimens (since 1982) were queried for the word ''eosinophil'' in biopsy descriptions. These samples were then limited to colonic biopsies by searching for specimens with the following terms: ''colon,'' ''sigmoid,'' ''rectum/sigmoid,'' ''sigmoid/rectum,'' ''rectum,'' ''rectal,'' or ''recto.'' Cases identified by either approach were narrowed down to include patients who met criteria for colonic eosinophilia. Colonic eosinophilia was defined as having an eosinophil count greater than the upper limit of normal in at least 1 colonic site (>50 eosinophils/hpf in the ascending colon, >42 eosinophils/hpf in the transverse and descending colon, >32 eosinophils/hpf in the rectosigmoid colon). 7, 8 A chart review of patients who met the criteria for colonic eosinophilia was performed to identify patients with EC or associated diseases.

Nontemplate controls (extraction chemistries) were included in the microbial DNA extraction process and the resulting material was subsequently used for PCR amplification. In addition, at the step of amplification, another set of nontemplate controls (PCR-mix) was included to evaluate the potential introduction of contamination at this step. Similarly, a positive control composed of known and previously characterized microbial DNA was included at this step to evaluate the efficiency of the amplification process. Before samples (unknowns) were pooled together, sequencing controls were evaluated and the rejection criteria were the presence of amplicons in any of the nontemplate controls or the absence of amplicons in the positive control. In the present study, no amplicons were observed in the nontemplate controls and a negligible amount of raw reads was recovered after sequencing.",

We compared the patient characteristics and clinical presentation between the virus categories, by using chi-square test and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate. We also compared the relative abundances of 10 most abundant genera between the virus categories by using 1-way ANOVA, adjusting for multiple comparisons with the use of the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate method. E17 We then tested the association of these virus categories with nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles by constructing a multinomial logistic regression model adjusting for 8 potential confounders (ie, age, sex, race/ethnicity, gestational age, siblings in the household, breast-feeding, history of breathing problems, and lifetime history of systemic antibiotic use). These potential confounders were chosen on the basis of clinical plausibility and a priori knowledge. E4,E18-E20 We reported all P values as 2-tailed, with P < .05 considered statistically significant. The data were analyzed with the use of R version 3.4.4 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) with the phyloseq package for the microbiota analysis. IQR, Interquartile range.
