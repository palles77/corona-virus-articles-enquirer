            "text": "Normal large bowel gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy 1-3 are outlined here. The large bowel extends from the ileocecal valve to the anus and measures 120 cm to 150 cm in adults. It can be clinically useful to divide the large bowel into regions. The cecum, the most proximal saccular part of the large bowel, lies inferior to a horizontal line defined by the ileocecal valve. The cecum is completely invested by peritoneum and contains the opening of the vermiform appendix. The right colon, 15 cm to 20 cm in length, extends to the hepatic flexure. The right colon lacks mesentery and lies mostly in the retroperitoneum except for its anterior and right lateral serosa. The transverse colon averages 30 cm to 60 cm in length, runs from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure, and has a mesentery. The descending colon begins at the splenic flexure, becomes retroperitoneal, and extends for 20 cm to 25 cm. At the distal portion of the descending colon, the large bowel once again acquires a mesentery to become the sigmoid colon, which measures approximately 40 cm in length. The sigmoid colon arbitrarily becomes the rectum at approximately the level of the third sacral vertebra. The rectum, measuring 10 cm to 15 cm in length, ends at the anal canal. The upper one third of the rectum is covered by peritoneum; the lower two thirds lies in the retroperitoneum surrounded by the fatty mesorectum.",

The muscularis externa of the large bowel is composed of an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinally running layer of smooth muscle that condenses into three longitudinally running taeniae coli, the mesocolic taenia and two antimesenteric taeniae. The taeniae unite at the base of the vermiform appendix. They flare at the rectum and incorporate into its external muscular layer. The inner and outer layers of muscularis externa are separated by the myenteric plexus of Auerbach. Appendages of subserosal fat typically hang from the large bowel to form the epiploic appendices.",

The remainder of the colon is supplied by the left colic and sigmoid branches of the inferior mesenteric artery. The inferior mesenteric artery and iliac vessels provide blood to the rectum. Veins accompany the arteries and share their names. The large bowel venous drainage enters the portal circulation except for the distal rectum, which drains into the systemic circulation through the middle and inferior rectal veins. In portal hypertension, this area can serve as a portalsystemic shunt and can be a site of varices. The lymph node drainage is divided into those lymph nodes close to the bowel wall (e.g., pericolic, perirectal) and those that follow the blood vessels (e.g., mesenteric).",

            "text": "The large bowel mucosa is composed of a single-cell layer of colorectal epithelium covering the lumen and lining the crypts, the supporting lamina propria and a small smooth muscle band referred to as the muscularis mucosae. The normal colorectal luminal surface of the mucosa is straight; the glands are made up of tubules (crypts) that are tightly packed, parallel, nonbranching, and closely approximating the muscularis mucosae ( Fig. 23-1) . The appearance of the colonic tubules is similar to rows of test tubes placed in a rack. Goblet cells interspersed between colorectal absorptive cells line the colonic tubules. Scattered neu-roendocrine cells can be observed usually near the base of the crypt and contain basally oriented eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. The lamina propria contains a modest amount of mixed inflammatory cells including plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, mast cells, and macrophages. Intraepithelial lymphocytes are present normally but usually are fewer than 6 per 100 colorectal epithelial cells. The muscularis mucosae is arranged into two layers (an inner circular and outer longitudinally running layer) and is usually thin and regular. The submucosa is typically devoid of inflammatory cells. Scattered mucosal and submucosal lymphoid follicles are normally encountered, especially in younger individuals. In areas of mucosal lymphoid follicles, the mucosal architecture may be distorted and the muscularis mucosae can be incomplete. Flattened epithelial cells known as M cells overlie the mucosal lymphoid aggregates. The epithelium of the M-cell zone typically contains numerous intraepithelial lymphocytes. [1] [2] [3] Paneth cells with their basal nuclei and luminal cytoplasmic refractile red granules are seen in the base of colonic crypts but are considered normal only in the cecum and proximal right colon. 2, 3 Mucosal biopsy interpretation can be hampered by changes associated with bowel preparation and with the trauma of the biopsy procedure itself. Changes ascribed to bowel preparation include decreased intraepithelial mucin, increased numbers of mitotic figures, surface apoptosis with karyorrhectic debris in the superficial lamina propria, and small numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils in surface or crypt epithelium. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Edema and recent hemorrhage into tissues not associated with other degenerative or inflammatory changes most likely represent biopsy-related trauma.",

            "text": "All adenomas demonstrate at least low-grade epithelial dysplasia. Without dysplasia, an adenoma cannot be recognized and distinguished from normal colonic mucosa. Lowgrade dysplasia is characterized by a slight decrease in the amount of intracellular mucin, mild nuclear enlargement with hyperchromasia, some nuclear stratification, and an increased number of mitotic figures (Fig. 23-4) . Increasing degrees of dysplasia (low-grade to high-grade) show progressive loss of intracellular mucin, progressive increase in nuclear size with stratification, and a loss of nuclear polarity. Adenocarcinoma in situ describes the next step in the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. Here, the atypical glands assume a complex cribriform or back-to-back gland configuration but the basement membrane remains intact (Fig. . Some experts consider adenocarcinoma in situ as part of the spectrum of high-grade glandular dysplasia and report both under the same term. 12 When carcinoma cells infiltrate into the lamina propria or muscularis mucosae only, terms such as high-grade glandular dysplasia and adenocarcinoma in situ are technically no longer applicable because both require an intact basement membrane. There- fore, the term intramucosal adenocarcinoma is more accurate (Fig. 23-6 ). 1, 11 Finally, when carcinoma cells have invaded the submucosa (or beyond) the lesion is labeled invasive adenocarcinoma. Invasion is invariably associated with an infiltrative pattern to neoplastic glands associated with tumor desmoplasia (Fig. 23-7) . This tumor desmoplasia is extremely helpful in recognizing invasion of at least the submucosa, especially in small biopsy specimens. The nomenclature controversy principally centers on the observation that in the colon and rectum, infiltrating carcinoma cells do not become clinically significant (i.e., able to metastasize) until they have invaded the submucosa. 1, 12, 15, 16 Only polyps containing invasive adenocarcinoma require a decision for additional treatment on the part of the clinician. Adenoma, adenocarcinoma in situ, and even intramucosal adenocarcinoma lack metastatic capability and are considered adequately treated by polypectomy alone. 1, 11, 13, 14, 16 As a result, some pathologists advocate modification of the nomenclature to account for clinical behavior and promulgate use of the term high-grade glandular dysplasia to encompass high-grade dysplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, and even intramucosal adenocarcinoma. 10, 14 Although the 1989 WHO guidelines accepted and defined two (low-grade, high-grade) or three (mild, moderate, severe) grades of dysplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, and intramucosal adenocarcinoma, the authors of those guidelines recommended a similar behavior-based modification for intramucosal carcinoma and stated that \"\u2026 intramucosal adenocarcinoma of the colon has not been shown to metastasize, and for this reason 'carcinoma in situ' is more appropriate.\" 11 The 2000 version of the WHO classification added little clarification and introduced new and even more confusing terms. 14 The authors stated that the defining feature of colorectal adenocarcinoma is invasion through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa. However, once defined, worrisome lesions not fulfilling this criterion become difficult to describe. For example, the 2000 WHO classification defines adenocarcinoma in situ and intramucosal adenocarcinoma as lesions with morphologic characteristics of \"adenocarcinoma\" confined to the epithelium or that \"invade\" the lamina propria alone and lack invasion through the muscularis mucosae. The WHO goes on to state that these lesions have virtually no risk of metastasis. According to the WHO, the term \"\u2026 high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia is more appropriate than adenocarcinoma in situ and \u2026 intramucosal neoplasia is more appropriate than intramucosal adenocarcinoma.\" In the 2000 version, the WHO believes that use of these terms will help avoid overtreatment. 14 The problems with this classification are many. The inaccurate use of the term invasion to describe lesions that are not by definition invasive carcinoma is confusing. The lesser lesion of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia sounds worse than the term used to describe intramucosal adenocarcinoma (intramucosal neoplasia). Furthermore, all adenomas, strictly speaking, are intraepithelial neoplasia. An effort to achieve consensus (largely between Eastern [Japanese] and Western pathologists) [17] [18] [19] [20] resulted in the Vienna classification of gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasia, 20 presented in Table  23-1. Problems with the Vienna system include the following: (1) inaccurate use of the word invasion; (2) category 4 \"noninvasive\" high-grade neoplasia including potentially dangerous lesions (e.g., suspicious for invasive adenocarcinoma); and (3) category 5 \"invasive neoplasms\" including intramucosal adenocarcinoma, which is widely accepted to be clinically benign in the colon and rectum. It is unlikely that this system of categories without clinical correlation will ever gain widespread acceptance.",

Some investigators have advocated surgical resection for all patients. 60 Currently, however, almost all surgeons and gastroenterologists embrace a more conservative approach and use certain gross and histologic features as indications for follow-up colectomy. 1, 58 These features include sessile growth, 16, 21 residual villous adenoma, a short stalk (<3 mm), 22 stalk invasion, 23 level 4 invasion, 16, 21 lymphatic or vascular permeation, 44 lack of a residual adjacent adenoma (so-called polypoid carcinoma), poor differentiation, 24, 25, 42, 43 and invasive carcinoma at or near a margin of resection. 24, 25, 42 We and others 24, 25, 29, 42 believe that two features identify patients likely to avoid an adverse outcome defined as residual or metastatic adenocarcinoma in a subsequent colectomy specimen or during clinical follow-up. Patients with favorable histology (defined as well-or moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a 2-mm tumor-free margin of resection in the polypectomy specimen) experienced no adverse outcome and are considered adequately treated by polypectomy alone. Similar, although not identical, therapeutic recommendations have been adopted by the ACG. 27, 28 These guidelines consider colonoscopic polypectomy definitive treatment for a patient with a malignant polyp if the following criteria are fulfilled: (1) the polyp is considered completely excised at endoscopy, (2) the specimen is properly processed by the pathology laboratory, (3) the cancer is not poorly differentiated, (4) no histologic evidence of vascular or lymphatic involvement exists, and (5) the resection margin is not involved by carcinoma.",

We think that lymphatic or venous invasion is not a reliable criterion because the distinction from retraction artifact is frequently difficult. Cooper and colleagues 44 encountered significant interobserver variation in assessing this feature. Furthermore, no guidelines exist that establish the extent to which a pathologist must go to diagnose lymphatic or venous invasion (e.g., number of sections or use of immunostains). Although patients can be stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups based on margin status and grade of invasive adenocarcinoma, 42 and lymphatic or 28 and in deference to these guidelines, the presence or absence of angiolymphatic invasion should be reported.",

For polyps without stalks (sessile growths or those in which the stalk has retracted), look for the effect of cautery on the gross specimen. This will appear as a lightercolored area or a defect on the external surface of the polyp. Carefully trim on either side of this defect (Fig. 23-10 ) and place this tissue in a block.

The other 16% of cases show strong familial clustering but a specific genetic cause has yet to be found. Colorectal carcinoma can also be viewed another way. Approximately 85% of colorectal cancers are thought to originate through the chromosomal instability pathway. These tumors typically demonstrate DNA aneuploidy and have abnormalities of chromosomes 5, 17, and 18 and contain mutational changes in APC gene, K-ras proto-oncogene, DCC tumor suppressor gene, and p53 tumor suppressor gene. 64 FAP colorectal carcinomas arise through this pathway. Approximately 15% of colorectal carcinoma appears to arise in the so-called mutator phenotype. These cancers tend to be DNA diploid and are associated with microsatellite instability (MSI).

DNA insults can result from the direct effects of chemicals or radiation and are usually corrected through the excision repair system. DNA replication errors are of two types: (1) simple mispairing of nucleotides, the most common type; and (2) \"slipping\" errors, in which genes may contain too many or too few copies of repeat short DNA nucleotide sequences known as microsatellites. Normally, these errors are recognized, the cell cycle is arrested, and the mismatched segment is corrected. For those errors not immediately corrected by DNA polymerase, the mismatch repair (MMR) system acts as a backup for additional proofreading of DNA. Failure to repair mismatches allows the error (mutation) to persist and to become the template for subsequent DNA replication. 65 The known MMR genes and their relative frequency in Lynch's syndrome are presented in Table 23-3. MSI is best viewed as an epiphenomenon found in colorectal tumor DNA but not in non-neoplastic tissues. It indicates that extensive mutation exists in the nonencoding repetitive DNA sequences that are particularly prone to replication error, the microsatellites. The majority of MSI is linked to somatic inactivation of hMLH1 through hypermethylation inactivation of the promotor region, but it can also be detected in persons with germline MMR gene mutations, the definition of Lynch's syndrome. 65 MSI is detected in 15% of colorectal cancers overall and is present in more than 95% of the cancers found in patients with Lynch's syndrome.",

The international guidelines for evaluation of MSI by PCR recommend use of consensus markers: BAT25, BAT26, D5S346, D2S123, and D17S250. If two or more markers are abnormal, the carcinoma is considered MSI-H. If one marker is abnormal, the tumor is classified as MSI-low (MSI-L). If no markers are abnormal, the cancer is referred to as MSI-stable (MSS). Laboratories using more than five loci modify this classification with 30% to 40% or more abnormal defined as MSI-H, less than 30% to 40% as MSI-L, and none abnormal as MSS. Immunohistochemistry can be used to detect MSI. Almost all MSI-H cancers can be identified if the antibody panel includes MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, and MSH6 (Figs. 23-13 and 23-14) . 73, 76 Immunohistochemical analysis and MSI analysis by PCR have specific advantages and limitations. PCR requires a molecular laboratory and usually requires normal tissue for comparison. Immunohistochemistry is more widely available but can be limited by poor tissue fixation or poor technique rendering interpretation difficult. Immunohistochemistry may be superior because the findings can direct gene sequencing and MSI is not always seen in Lynch's syndrome kindred with MSH6 germline mutation. 66 Patients with MSI-H cancer should undergo additional genetic testing including gene sequencing. MSS and MSI-L tumors require no further testing. 63 Additional genetic evaluation may be considered if the clinical history is compelling.",

Subtotal colectomy is usually recommended to treat colon cancer related to Lynch's syndrome because of the high likelihood of synchronous or metachronous cancers. Partial colectomy with colonoscopy every 1 to 2 years is a reasonable alternative. 66 Furthermore, clinicians can institute proper screening such as colonoscopy at a young age (beginning at age 25 or 5 years younger than the youngest cancer history in the family), periodic endometrial sampling (every 1 to 2 years starting at age 25 years), pelvic ultrasound, CA125 serum testing, and urine cytology or molecular testing for urinary tract carcinoma. Many experts screen all resected colorectal cancers for MSI initially by PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis is a useful alternative and some prefer this as the initial test because an abnormality in protein expression correlates almost invariably with MSI-H by PCR. In cases showing normal MMR proteins or equivocal staining by immunohistochemical analysis, MSI testing by PCR should be done in clinically suspicious cases to exclude a germline mutation that can yield an antigenic protein that is biologically inactive.",

This regenerative area can occasionally cause diagnostic confusion with dysplasia and carcinoma, especially in a variant referred to as inverted hyperplastic polyp. 82, 83 In this inverted variety, the regenerative epithelium of the crypt base is misplaced into or beneath the muscularis mucosae. Most examples of inverted hyperplastic polyp are now probably best classified as sessile serrated polyp (see later) and are easily recognized if one is cognizant of its existence and also notes the overall architectural and cytologic similarity to hyperplastic polyp/sessile serrated polyp. The entity is distinguished from invasive adenocarcinoma by the lack of infiltration and tumor desmoplasia. The differential diagnosis between hyperplastic polyp and tubular adenoma can be difficult, especially in a diminutive polyp that has been treated by hot biopsy (so-called thermal polyp). Useful features in the differential diagnosis are found in Table 23-4. When the choice between hyperplastic polyp and tubular adenoma is difficult, as long as an adenoma diagnosis is not going to result in surgical resection (e.g., right colonic adenoma incompletely excised), we err on the side of adenoma to ensure that the patient will receive more frequent surveillance.

Transitions from sessile serrated polyps to areas of dysplasia and carcinoma with loss of hMLH1 protein expression have been described . 97, 98 Sessile serrated polyps as the name implies are sessile, large (frequently \u22651 cm), right sided, and often show poor endoscopic circumscription. Numerous cytologic and architectural abnormalities have been reported in sessile serrated polyps, especially those associated with carcinoma. 92, 95, 97, 98 The abnormal proliferation or dysmaturation features include persisting nuclear atypia with large nuclei and nucleoli high (upper third) in the crypts, high (upper third of the crypt) mitotic figures, and irregular distribution of dystrophic goblet cells. Architectural abnormalities include basal crypt dilatation, horizontally oriented crypts, crypt branching, an increased epithelial-to-stromal ratio (>50%), inverted crypts, prominent serration, increased surface villosity or papillations, and the lack of a surface basement membrane thickening typical of conventional hyperplastic polyps. Some authors suggest that a diagnosis of sessile serrated polyp requires the presence of at least four of the architectural and abnormal proliferation features mentioned earlier (Figs. 23-21 and 23-22) . 102 Once recognized, the sessile serrated polyp creates a patient management dilemma. Calling them \"sessile serrated adenomas\" may not be an appropriate default. First and foremost, these lesions do not show the cytologic dysplasia that should be definitional for adenoma. Sessile serrated adenoma is often confused by gastroenterologists and surgeons with serrated adenoma or villous adenoma. It is unknown whether colonic resection (which is typically done for incompletely excised adenomas) should be recommended for sessile serrated polyps that are incompletely excised at endoscopy. Furthermore, endoscopic follow-up for serrated adenoma would typically be in 3 years (if the clinician considers serrated adenoma or sessile serrated adenoma a variant villous adenoma) or in 5 years. In a cohort of 91 patients with sessile serrated polyps preceding MSI-H carcinomas, 19 predated the carcinomas by less than 3 years. 95 We think that these lesions should be diagnosed as sessile serrated polyps and that they should be treated by complete endoscopic excision if possible. Until more is known, a shorter surveillance interval (e.g., 1 to 2 years) rather than resection seems prudent for these types of polyps that are incompletely excised or associated with additional, endoscopically similar polyps that have remained unsampled.

Approximately half of all large bowel carcinomas occur in the rectum, 25% occur in the sigmoid colon, and the rest are evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the colon. 1 That said, with increased use of colonoscopy with removal of adenomas, clinicians have seen a right-sided migration of carcinomas since the late 1970s. Carcinomas of the right colon tend to produce large, exophytic tumors (see Fig. 23 -11) . Carcinomas of the descending colon are more likely to be stenotic and produce the so-called \"napkin ring\" tumor. Carcinomas anywhere can be fungating, ulcerated, or necrotic masses; the most common macroscopic appearance is an ulcer with raised, indurated edges (Fig. 23 The following features adversely affect prognosis: advanced stage, extensive local spread, lymph node involvement, aggressive histologic type, high histologic grade, extramural venous invasion, and free mesothelial surface invasion. 1, 67, [107] [108] [109] Although useful information is gleaned through these classic grading and staging exercises, the process is not without problems and controversy. No general agreement exists on staging or grading and all current schemes have shortcomings.

No doubt exists that searching for lymph nodes in a resection specimen is tedious. The lymph node yield per case is directly proportional to the dissector's enthusiasm and skill. As a general rule, a standard resection specimen for carcinoma of the sigmoid colon or rectum should contain 10 to 25 lymph nodes, although we all have had cases in which the dissector found far fewer. Minimum numbers of lymph nodes harvested is increasingly considered a measure of quality. 112, 113 Therefore, the routine use of clearance techniques for lymph node dissection has been debated. Certainly, clearance techniques have advantages. One is likely to find more lymph nodes in a specimen and the lymph node yield will no longer depend solely on the dissector's ability and enthusiasm. However, the clearance process is time consuming and it may delay reporting. 114, 115 Clearing is relatively expensive because of the large volumes of clearing agents used and the prolonged technologists' or pathologists' time.

However, the proportion of stage 1, 2, and 3 cases did not change. The number of positive lymph nodes found was similar between cleared and noncleared groups. This finding was later confirmed. 113 Clearance techniques are considered unnecessary for routine cases. 67, 116 Additional controversy is added by consideration of nontraditional methods of lymph node examination such as the following: immunohistochemical analysis for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratins, and epithelial membrane antigen; PCR testing looking for tumor DNA or RNA; and sentinel lymph node examination. The biologic significance of these nontraditional methods lacks validation, 67, [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] and \"positive\" nodes found by these techniques may have no effect on prognosis. 122 Currently, the CAP recommends that all grossly identified lymph nodes be sectioned (without multiple levels) in a routine fashion. 67, 121 Pathologists should find as many lymph nodes as possible and should recognize that the rules of representative sampling and probability apply. 112 As a general rule, 12 negative lymph nodes usually correlate with true pN0 status. 112, 121, 123, 124 Extramural tumor nodules of any size with smooth con- tours are counted as replaced regional lymph nodes. 111 Sentinel lymph node examination does not accurately predict either conventionally defined nodal metastasis or micrometastasis and is not considered useful in the study of patients with colorectal carcinoma. 125 ",

Approximately 70% of adenocarcinomas are moderately differentiated (grade II) exhibiting a more complex and irregular tubular pattern, and the polarity of nuclei is lost or is only barely discernible ( Fig. 23-25 ). The remaining poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (grade III) consist of highly irregular glands or may show an absence of glandular architecture. Nuclear polarity is lost ( Fig. 23-26 ). When variability exists within a given tumor, the grade is determined by the worst area no matter how small. Mucinous carcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma are considered poorly differentiated or grade III. 133 Jass and colleagues 111 investigated grading using a Cox regression analysis model in 447 resection specimens. The only grading parameters associated with prognosis were the amount of tubule configuration, the pattern of growth (expanding versus infiltrative), and the degree of lymphocytic infiltration. When stage-related parameters were added into the Cox regression model, only three factors emerged as significant: (1) lymph node involvement, (2) local spread (i.e., the components of stage), and (3) the amount of lymphocytic infiltration in the neoplasm (i.e., a reflection of MSI status). This study provided the scientific verification of the original observation by Dukes and Bussey 132 that grade was subservient to stage in prognosis and re-emphasizes the need for careful specimen dissection and examination to determine the amount of local spread and lymph node status.",

With this technique, thousands of measurements can be made in seconds and displayed on a histogram. The position of peaks on the x-axis is proportional to the amount of DNA per cell, and the height of the peaks on the y-axis is proportional to the number of cells demonstrating a particular DNA content.

Other investigators showed no independent association between DNA aneuploidy and prognosis in a large group of patients with colorectal carcinoma, with stage as the only independent variable associated with prognosis. 140 DNA content analysis by flow cytometry is of no proved clinical value. 67 The technology and methods lack standardization, and the results among groups generally are not comparable. Most published studies have employed paraffin-embedded material. This may not be optimal because DNA fragments and partial nuclei tend to stick together, thus leading to increased yields of pseudoaneuploid histograms. 133 The proportion of cases showing aneuploid peaks is lower when fresh intact cells are used. In terms of interpretation, control histograms are easy to read but tumor histograms are less clean and interpretations are subject to interobserver variation. In a cohort of 165 patients with colorectal carcinoma prospectively studied, results of flow cytometric analysis showed no correlation between DNA aneuploidy and any standard staging or grading parameter and had no independent association with prognosis. 133, 141 The CAP believes that DNA analysis has not been adequately studied for determination of prognostic value and the data are insufficient to recommend a specific technologic method. 67 Various proliferation markers have been studied in colorectal carcinoma. For example, a cohort of 122 patients with colorectal carcinoma were studied using an antibody that recognizes Ki-67, a nuclear antigen expressed in all phases of the cell cycle except G 0 . 108 No correlation was found between Ki-67 scores and stage, grade, or prognosis. Stage, growth pattern, and lymphocytic infiltration were the only factors independently associated with prognosis. The CAP believes that data are insufficient to recommend inclusion of proliferation indices in pathology reports for prognostic information. 67 Early Nonpolypoid Colorectal Carcinoma Early invasive colorectal carcinoma (pT1-invasive carcinoma limited to the submucosa) warrants special mention given the advent of endoscopic techniques allowing gastroenterologists and surgeons to resect some carcinomas locally either surgically or through the endoscope (e.g., endoscopic mucosal resection [EMR]). Because lymph node status is the strongest prognostic factor in colorectal carcinoma, the question asked, particularly by surgeons, is whether local excision or EMR is enough or should definitive surgical resection be performed for pT1 lesions. The issue is further complicated by the low rate of lymph node metastases in pT1 colorectal carcinoma, estimated at 3% to 17%. 132, [142] [143] [144] [145] This dilemma prompted evaluation of histologic parameters and molecular markers that correlate with positive lymph node status in excised pT1 colorectal carcinoma.",

Irinotecan is hydrolyzed into an active metabolite (SN-38) by hepatic carboxyl esterase. SN-38 is converted into an inactive form by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase isoform 1A1 (UGT1A1). In patients with polymorphisms of UGT1A1, the toxicities of irinotecan (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, alopecia) are more severe. Although results indicate that UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms have some relevance to toxicity, especially hematologic toxicity with the first cycle of chemotherapy, 161 determination of the polymorphism seems to have marginal clinical implications. The observed toxicities can be managed clinically, other UGT1A enzymes may play a role as well, 162 and data do not support dose reduction based on a molecular test.",

Adenosquamous carcinoma has been described in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), FAP, schistosomiasis, and endometriosis. Occasionally, squamous differentiation can be found in adenomas (Fig. 23-30 ). Pure squamous colorectal carcinoma outside of the anal canal is extremely rare. The possible diagnosis of metastasis must be excluded. Squamous carcinoma has been reported in fistulas, in association with radiation, and in patients with IBD, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis. 1,14,166 Occasional case reports of microglandular goblet cell adenocarcinoma (goblet cell carcinoid) identical to that seen in the vermiform appendix have been described in the large bowel. These tumors are composed of trabeculae and nests of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cells showing differentiation toward goblet cells. Scattered or no endocrine differentiation is characteristically seen by immunohistochemical analysis for chromogranin and synaptophysin.

This is especially true in the setting of low rectal or anorectal lymphoid hyperplasia (so-called anorectal tonsil) and in defunctioned bowel seen in the setting of primary IBD. Localized lymphoid hyperplasia of the anorectal area can manifest with bleeding, prolapse, or anorectal discomfort. The endoscopic appearance can vary from a sessile polyp, which can measure up to 5.0 cm in greatest dimension, to mere thickening of the mucosa resembling cobblestoning. Histologically, one sees lymphoid hyperplasia with germinal center formation and scattered interfollicular collections of pale-staining histiocytes. 1 Distinction from follicular lymphoma can usually be made with standard H&E-stained sections but immunostaining for bcl-2, which is overexpressed in follicular lymphoma because of the t(14;18) translocation, can be an extremely helpful adjunct. Positive bcl-2 staining is seen in neoplastic follicles but not in reactive germinal centers. 174 Up to 40% of cases of multiple lymphomatous polyposis are caused by follicular lymphoma (Fig. 23-35 ). 176 Mantle cell lymphoma usually manifests with widespread lymphadenopathy and frequent bone marrow involvement. Overt GI tract involvement occurs in 10% to 20% of patients and clinically occult disease can affect up to 80% of patients. 177 Colonic involvement can manifest as a mass, a polyp, diffuse mucosal thickening, or multiple lymphomatous polyposis. 1 Approximately one third of patients with lymphomatous polyposis have mantle cell lymphoma. 176 The histologic pattern of mantle cell lymphoma typically shows mucosa and submucosal infiltrates by small atypical lymphocytes surrounding germinal centers with effacement. The lymphoma cells express the B-cell marker CD20 and often coexpress CD5. The t(11;14) translocation causes overexpression of cyclin D-1, which is now considered defining. 173, 174 Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type can involve the colon and rectum and is responsible for up to 25% of cases manifesting as multiple lymphomatous polyposis. 1, 176 Similar to its appearance in the stomach, colorectal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type creates destructive lymphoepithelial lesions and produces an expansive proliferation of marginal zone lymphocytes. An appropriate immunohistochemical profile includes positive staining for pan B-cell markers and negative staining for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD31, and cyclin D-1. Gene rearrangement studies by PCR can be helpful in difficult cases. 1, 173, 174 ",

            "text": "Vascular ectasia of the right colon has numerous synonyms, including angiodysplasia, arteriovenous malformation, and the type I lesion of Moore and colleagues. 1, 190, 192, 193 Vascular ectasia of the right colon is a well-defined clinicopathologic entity with a distinct type of lesion and pathogenesis. Patients are typically elderly and present with episodes of recurrent low-grade lower GI bleeding. Approximately 15% of patients present with massive GI hemorrhage. The lesions nearly always manifest in the cecum or right colon and are often multiple. Vascular ectasia of the right colon is usually not associated with other conditions. Reports linking vascular ectasia of the right colon to aortic valvular disease have been criticized. 194, 195 However, bleeding vascular ectasias may be associated with aortic stenosis and associated abnormalities in von Willebrand factor (deficiency of the largest multimers). 196 Colonoscopic and radiographic examination will show almost all lesions. Endoscopically, vascular ectasias appear as erythematous mucosal macules or papules measuring 0.1 mm to 10 mm in diameter ( Fig. 23-38 ). They may be round, oval, or stellate. A \"feeding\" vessel may be visible. Angiographic signs of vascular ectasia include the densely opacified, slowly emptying vein, an opacified vascular tuft, early opacification (filling) of a draining vein, or, rarely, extravasation of contrast media into the lumen. Vascular ectasia is usually treated primarily by the endoscopist (heat probe or other endoscopic ablation technique) or by the radiologist (vasopressin infusion or transcatheter embolization) at the time of diagnosis. 197, 198 The typical curative surgery, right hemicolectomy, is rarely performed and is often reserved for those cases in which endoscopy or radiography could not be performed or treatment was not successful or for perforative complications of endoscopic or angiographic treatment. Vascular ectasia is notoriously difficult to identify by standard pathologic techniques in resection specimens. Demonstration of the lesion usually requires some form of vascular injection. Boley and Brandt's technique employs injection of the fresh specimen vasculature with a silicon rubber compound. The specimen is then fixed in formalin, dehydrated in graded alcohols, and cleared with methylsalicylate. 192 This technique produces a transparent specimen in which the vasculature can be examined by epi-illumination and transillumination under a dissecting microscope. Using this technique, the vascular ectasias appear as \"coral reef-like\" arrangements measuring 0.1 cm to 2.0 cm in diameter contrasted against the honeycombed pattern of the normal colonic mucosal vasculature. Histologic examination reveals abnormal thin-walled ectatic veins, venules, and capillaries localized to the mucosa and submucosa. The lesions are thought to result from repetitive partial obstruction to venous drainage caused by contraction of the muscularis propria. Wall tension is directly proportional to lumen diameter, a finding that may explain the lesion's predilection for the right colon, where the diameter is the greatest. Obviously, vascular injection techniques require preparation in terms of materials. If caught unprepared, one may still demonstrate larger ectasias by carefully and gently washing off the mucosal surface of the specimen with water. Sometimes, a blood clot adheres to the bleeding point and this may direct the histologic sectioning. We have been disappointed with injection of contrast media and specimen radiography but have had success demonstrating right-sided vascular ectasia by injecting brightly colored ink into the ileocolic artery. Some investigators have reported success by bluntly dissecting the mucosa from the muscular wall of the formalin-fixed bowel followed by dehydration and transillumination. 199 hemangiomas Many isolated hemangiomas may be classified on the basis of the predominant vessel type as capillary, cavernous, venous, arteriovenous, or mixed. 1 Capillary hemangiomas are typically small, rarely multiple, and composed of small, closely packed capillaries. These lesions may be found in the colon but are usually encountered in the small intestine, appendix, and perianal skin. 200 Some lesions reported as capillary hemangiomas may, in fact, be vascular ectasias (see earlier). Capillary hemangiomas rarely cause clinical symptoms. Cavernous, venous, arteriovenous, and other mixture hemangiomas occur in localized or diffuse forms [201] [202] [203] [204] and have the same clinical significance regardless of vessel type .",

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. 191, 208 Two disease-causing genes have been identified, endoglin and ALK-1. 209 Vascular lesions occur in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs, including liver, genitourinary tract, meninges, eyes, and spinal cord. The mucocutaneous lesions appear in the second and third decades of life. Many patients present with recurrent epistaxis in childhood. Approximately 15% of patients with HHT, usually older patients, have GI bleeding. The histopathologic pattern of the colorectal lesion is simple dilatation of normal vascular structures (i.e., telangiectasia) and in general resembles the lesions of right-sided vascular ectasia ( Fig. 23-40 ).",

Currently, an aggressive variant of Kaposi's sarcoma in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is most commonly seen [225] [226] [227] and has been linked to infection with human herpesvirus 8. 228 The GI tract of patients with AIDS is frequently involved by Kaposi's sarcoma. 227 Investigators have estimated that about half of the patients with cutaneous or lymph node Kaposi's sarcoma have concomitant GI tract involvement. [229] [230] [231] Rarely, the GI tract can be involved without skin lesions. GI tract Kaposi's sarcoma is typically asymptomatic but occasional GI Kaposi's sarcoma can cause bleeding, obstruction, perforation, or protein-losing enteropathy. 1, 232 GI Kaposi's sarcoma has numerous appearances grossly and endoscopically. 1 Although red macules have been described, Kaposi's sarcoma more characteristically causes a red or purple nodule or plaque measuring 15 mm or more. 229 Some patients with GI Kaposi's sarcoma have large tumors. Despite the vascular nature of the neoplasm, lesions can be sampled for biopsy and in most instances bleed surprisingly little. The diagnostic yield with biopsy has been notoriously low 227 ; in one report, only 13% of upper GI specimens and 36% of sigmoidoscopic specimens tested positive. 229 Usually, the low yield is attributed to the preferential submucosal location of Kaposi's sarcoma that may not be sampled in an endoscopic biopsy specimen. That said, examples of Kaposi's sarcoma are easily overlooked by even experienced pathologists, because the sarcoma is subtle and can be dismissed as granulation tissue.",

The spindle cells are usually not extremely mitotically active and at first glance may suggest granulation tissue (although macrophages and mononuclear inflammatory cells are typically absent) or the fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria associated with the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (prolapse or trauma-related change). Generally, GI Kaposi's sarcoma is histologically similar to Kaposi's sarcoma seen elsewhere. 227 The histologic pattern shows spindle cells, vascular clefts, extravasated red blood cells frequently associated with hemosiderin deposits, and occasionally tumor necrosis ( Fig. 23-41 ). Kaposi's sarcoma cells usually stain with antibodies directed against factor VIII-related antigen but more consistently stain positive with endothelial markers such as CD34 and CD31.",

Important clues to the proper diagnosis include (1) knowledge of the clinical situation, (2) knowledge of the endoscopic appearance, (3) recognition of crowding and hyperchromasia in the spindle cell nuclei, (4) recognition of slits and spaces containing red blood cells, and (5) recognition of the tendency for Kaposi's sarcoma cells to overrun or obliterate the muscularis mucosae. 1 Aggressive antiretroviral therapy is now considered the first-line treatment for GI Kaposi's sarcoma. 233, 234 Other forms of treatment are reserved for symptomatic tumors. 232 Surgical procedures are performed for obstruction or severe bleeding. Chemotherapy approaches have improved but the treatment is risky in an already immunocompromised patient. These therapies offer palliation at best. Treatment with zidovudine (formerly azidothymidine [AZT]) does not have an effect on GI Kaposi's sarcoma. 235, 236 Immunomodulation has been tested but is not used. 232, 237, 238 The addition of taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) to aggressive antiretroviral therapy appears promising. 239, 240 Angiosarcoma Angiosarcomas are only rarely encountered in the colon and rectum. 241 The varied histologic spectrum ranges from wellformed vascular structures to sheets of malignant polygonal or spindle cells. Grossly and endoscopically, angiosarcomas form red-gray polypoid masses. An immunohistochemical panel including CD31 and factor VIII-antigen can be useful in diagnosis.",

Genetic testing should be considered for FAP, attenuated FAP, and mutY homologue (MYH)-associated polyposis (MAP) when 10 or more colorectal adenomas are found in a patient during a single examination or over time. 66 Screening of first-degree relatives of affected individuals should begin at the age of 10 years. 63 In the absence of genetic testing, endoscopic screening is still useful to detect FAP. All affected patients have adenomas within the range of a flexible sigmoidoscope. It is therefore recommended that screening sigmoidoscopy begin at age 14 years with re-examination every 2 years. The diagnosis of FAP must be confirmed with biopsy because lymphoid polyposis and hyperplastic polyposis can mimic FAP grossly and endoscopically. Once a diagnosis of FAP has been established, prophylactic proctocolectomy is recommended. Most investigators recommend sigmoidoscopy for mutation-negative kindred at age 12 years just in case the genetic test is erroneous. Thyroid examination for associated thyroid lesions (usually papillary carcinoma with cribriform pattern 245 ) and determination of serum alpha fetoprotein (to screen for hepatoblastoma) are recommended.",

            "text": "Regular upper endoscopy should also be performed. Gastric and duodenal polyps develop in 30% to 90% of patients with FAP. 246 The gastric lesions are usually fundic gland polyposis, whereas the duodenal polyps are usually adenomas. The fundic gland polyps can develop a peculiar surface epithelial atypia called foveolar dysplasia, 247 but progression to carcinoma is extremely rare. 229 The incidence of duodenal adenomas in FAP increases with increasing age. Duodenal adenomas have a propensity to develop in the periampullary region. Adenomas anywhere in the GI tract can proceed through the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence. The relative risk of duodenal or periampullary carcinoma in patients with FAP is approximately 125 to 350 times that seen in the general population, and duodenal or periampullary carcinoma has become the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with FAP in the post-prophylactic colectomy era. 248 The gene responsible for FAP (APC gene) has been localized to the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q21-q22) and has been cloned. [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] Some APC gene mutation-negative cases may be caused by mutation of MYH (see later). 254 Mutation in most patients with FAP creates a stop codon resulting in a truncated protein product. The APC gene is a tumor suppressor gene and the APC protein is part of the Wntsignaling pathway 66, 255 involved in cell growth control. When the APC gene is mutated, beta-catenin accumulates, thus altering expression of certain genes affecting proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. 256 Most patients are now diagnosed by DNA sequencing, which has largely replaced the assay to detect the truncated APC protein (PTT). 63, 256 Monoallelic mutation analysis (MAMA) examines the two APC alleles independently and can detect more than 95% of patients with FAP. Another test, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), is useful in detecting large deletions. 256 More than 700 disease-causing APC gene mutations have been reported. 256 Localization of mutations within the APC gene locus correlates with phenotype. For example, germline mutations between codon 1250 and codon 1464 are associated with very large numbers of colonic adenomas, whereas mutations elsewhere, especially near the 5\u2032 end or the 3\u2032 end of the APC gene and an area of exon 9, yield lesser numbers of colonic adenomas (see the later discussion of attenuated FAP). 63, [256] [257] [258] In Gardner's variant, in addition to colonic adenomas and upper GI polyps, patients can exhibit extraintestinal manifestations such as osteomas, epidermal inclusion cysts and other benign skin tumors, desmoid tumors of the abdomen or abdominal wall, fibrosis of mesentery, dental abnormalities, carcinoma of the periampullary region or duodenum, and carcinoma of the thyroid. Patients with Gardner's syndrome have APC gene mutations; however, no particular APC mutation distinguishes FAP from Gardner's variant. Even within a \"Gardner's family,\" Gardner's stigmata can be variably expressed and can skip generations. 253 Therefore, some unknown disease-modifying factors are required for phenotypic expression of the extraintestinal manifestations.",

            "text": "Juvenile polyps can occur in a sporadic form or can be part of juvenile polyposis syndrome. In the sporadic form, juvenile polyps have their peak prevalence in children between 1 and 7 years of age. Some evidence indicates that juvenile polyps once formed can regress; they can certainly be seen in adults. Sporadic juvenile polyps typically occur singly but patients can have up to five, usually located in the rectum. Juvenile polyps typically range in size up to 2 cm and can be associated with overt prolapse (Fig. 23-43 ). 262 Because these polyps are often attached by a small pedicle, they are prone to autoamputation. Histologically, typical juvenile polyps consist of a hamartomatous overgrowth of the lamina propria accompanied by elongation and cystic dilatation of colonic crypts lined by nondysplastic colonic epithelium ( Fig. 23-44 ). 66 Osseous and cartilaginous stromal metaplasia can occur ( Fig. 23-45 ). The inflammatory component of juvenile polyps can be quite prominent with neutrophils and lymphoid follicles within the lamina propria. Frequently, the distinction between juvenile polyps and inflammatory polyps of primary IBD cannot be made on histologic grounds alone and requires clinical correlation. Nonsyndromatic juvenile polyps appear to have no malignant potential. 263 Juvenile polyposis syndrome can be familial or nonfamilial and usually becomes clinically apparent within the first decade of life with painless rectal bleeding, prolapse, iron deficiency anemia, or passage of an autoamputated polyp. 244 Patients are considered to have juvenile polyposis syndrome if they have six or more juvenile polyps in the colon and rectum, have juvenile polyps throughout the GI tract, or have any number of juvenile polyps in association with a positive family history. 262, 264 In the nonfamilial forms of juvenile polyposis syndrome (\u224830% of the total), patients frequently have associated abnormalities, such as cardiac defects, hydrocephalus, gut malrotation, undescended testes, and skull abnormalities. 244 Patients with the familial forms usually lack these extraintestinal manifestations. Inheritance has varied although almost all are considered autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. 244 Familial forms of juvenile polyposis syndrome appear to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. 264 Prophylactic colectomy may be prudent in juvenile polyposis syndrome. Patients may also have an increased risk of gastric, small intestinal, and pancreatic carcinoma. 265 Juvenile polyposis syndrome coexisting with HHT (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome) is rarely reported. 265 The number of polyps in juvenile polyposis syndrome typically ranges from a few dozen to several hundred ( Fig.  23-46) . Phenotypically, juvenile polyposis syndrome appears to occur in three varieties: (1) polyps limited to the colon, (2) polyps limited to the stomach, and (3) polyps throughout the entire GI tract. [266] [267] [268] The mucosal polyps found in the context of juvenile polyposis syndromes are often unusual histologically. In addition to the typical juvenile polyps described earlier, one can find juvenile polyps with atypical features such as more epithelium than lamina propria. In addition, mixture polyps (juvenile polyps with areas of adenoma or dysplasia) are quite frequent. 244 265, [271] [272] [273] seen in 25% of cases. One should consider genetic testing for juvenile polyposis syndrome when three or more juvenile polyps have occurred in one individual or when juvenile polyps are found outside the colon. 66 MADH4 and BMPR1A are both components of the signaling pathway for transforming growth factor-b and the bone morphogenetic proteins. Patients with MADH4 gene mutation are more likely to have gastric juvenile polyposis. 265, 274, 275 Juvenile polyps can be found in patients with other hamartomatous syndromes of the colon, such as intestinal ganglioneuromatosis or ganglioneurofibromatosis (see later), [276] [277] [278] although some of these syndromes are now best classified as PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) syndrome (see later).",

            "text": "Peutz-Jeghers polyps can be found throughout the GI tract, either sporadically or as part of the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. 1, 282, 283 The polyp itself is characterized by fairly normal epithelium and lamina propria lining an abnormal arborizing network of smooth muscle that represents hamartomatous overgrowth of the muscularis mucosae ( Fig.  23-47 ). 1, 282, 284 Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, is the combination of skin hyperpigmentation and Peutz-Jeghers polyps in the GI tract. The diagnosis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is considered definitive if the patient has a Peutz-Jeghers polyp and at least two of the following criteria: (1) family history, (2) mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation, and (3) small bowel polyposis. 265, 283 The pigmentation consists of clusters of brown or black freckles about the lips, buccal mucosa, and perianal and genital region. Pigmented areas can occasionally be seen on the fingers and toes. The spots appear in the first year of life and tend to fade toward middle age. The polyps usually number only in the dozens and can be found throughout the GI tract. These polyps have a propensity to form in the small intestine where they often cause intussusception. In rare kindred, Peutz-Jeghers polyps have been limited to the large bowel. Cases of complicating GI carcinoma have been reported. 285, 286 Approximately 5% of female patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome have a peculiar ovarian tumor, sex cord tumor with annular tubules (SCTAT). 287 The rate of detection may increase if the ovaries are carefully examined, 287, 288 and some tumors may be associated with sexual precocity. 289 Male patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome occasionally have unilateral or bilateral Sertoli cell tumors of the testes. 290, 291 Adenoma malignum and pancreaticobiliary tract carcinomas are reported to occur at increased rates. 292 The Peutz-Jeghers syndrome has been linked to the STK11 (serine/threonine-protein kinase 11, also known as LKB1) gene on chromosome 19p13.3 [293] [294] [295] [296] and can be demonstrated in 70% of cases. 265 This is a tumor suppressor gene involved in transduction of intracellular growth signals. 66 Investigators have suggested that genetic testing be considered for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome when any Peutz-Jeghers polyps or typical perioral pigmentations are found. 66 Meta-analysis of cancer risk in an evaluation of patients with known mutations of the STK11 gene have shown increased lifetime risk for cancer of the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon, pancreas, and breast. 283, 297 Putting this into perspective, the risk for breast cancer in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is similar to the risk seen in individuals with germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is the strongest known risk factor for pancreatic carcinoma except for hereditary pancreatitis. 283 Screening at-risk individuals (first-degree relatives of a patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome) should begin at birth with an annual history and physical examination to look specifically for melanotic spots, precocious puberty, and testicular tumors. Asymptomatic at-risk individuals without stigmata by age 8 years should be tested for STK11/LKB1 gene mutations. If mutation is not found in the family, small intestinal contrast radiography every 2 years until age 25 years is recommended. Other investigators suggest that upper and lower endoscopy with small bowel series should be done at ages 12, 18, and 24 years. 283 Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and upper GI radiographic series with small bowel follow through are recommended in patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome commencing at age 8 years and repeated every 2 years thereafter. 283, 298 Colonoscopy every 3 years is recommended starting with symptoms or by age 18 years if symptoms have not occurred. 66, 283 Testicular examination, pelvic examination by age 20 years, mammographic examination by age 25 years, and endoscopic ultrasound examination of the pancreas by age 25 to 30 years have been recommended. 229, 283 Annual transvaginal ultrasound examination and serum CA-125 determination are also recommended commencing at age 25 years. 283",

The nail dystrophy consists of thinning, splitting, and separation from the nail bed (onycholysis). Onychomadesis (complete loss of the nail) can also occur. The hair loss is rapid and may be seen in the scalp, eyebrow, face, axilla, or pubic region. The cutaneous hyperpigmentation ranges from small macules to confluent areas of hyperpigmentation that can be 10 cm or more.

Mucosal and submucosal involvement can cause mucosal polyps. 316 Endometriosis must be distinguished from m\u00fcllerian adenosarcoma and endometrial stromal sarcoma. The glandular component can be confused with colitis cystica profunda and adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis for CD10, which highlights endometrial stromal cells, can be helpful in the differential diagnosis as can recognition of ciliated epithelial cells. Differential cytokeratin immunostaining can also help because endometriosis commonly stains positive for CK7, whereas colorectal epithelium usually expresses CK20.

Included under this heading are UC in an active phase, most examples of Crohn's disease, and infectious colitis or acute self-limited colitis. 326, 327 UC in an active phase represents the prototype diffuse active colitis. Biopsy specimens usually demonstrate diffuse abnormalities, meaning that changes are of approximately the same intensity in all areas of the tissue submitted from a particular region of the colon. The luminal border of the mucosa is irregular. [323] [324] [325] [326] [327] [328] [329] Increased numbers of chronic inflammatory cells are present in the lamina propria and may occasionally spill over into the superficial portion of the submucosa. Intracellular mucin in goblet cells is diffusely depleted. 330 Cryptitis and crypt abscess formation are often prominent (Fig. 23-57 ). It is surprising that even in UC of extremely short overt clinical duration, atrophy, branching, and budding of crypts are already apparent in many specimens. 7, [324] [325] [326] [327] [328] [329] This crypt distortion coupled with basal plasmacytosis, which is defined as increased plasma cells in the lower fifth of the mucosa, has been proposed as the most useful histologic criterion to differentiate primary IBD from infectious colitis or acute self-limited colitis. 323, [326] [327] [328] Remember, the most a pathologist can conclude from a biopsy specimen showing this pattern of injury is that the changes are consistent with UC in an active phase. The diffuse active colitis pattern of injury can also be seen in some examples of Crohn's disease 324, 328 and in some cases of documented infectious colitis, 331 although we think it is likely that these cases represent an infectious exacerbation of an underlying, albeit clinically latent, primary IBD. The diffuse active colitis pattern of injury has been reported in a form of colitis associated with diverticular disease. 332 However, this entity can be distinguished from classic UC by virtue of its rectal sparing and the presence of inflammation only in areas of diverticula.",

That said, germinal centers, tangential cuts of blood vessels, tangential cuts of the pericryptal fibroblastic sheath, and an inflammatory reaction to extravasated mucin (so-called mucin granulomas) are often misinterpreted as the granulomas of Crohn's disease. In the absence of true granulomas, biopsy specimens from patients with Crohn's disease often show the focal active colitis pattern of injury without neutrophils in the lamina propria. Some examples of Crohn's colitis can be indistinguishable from resolving mucosal UC in biopsy specimens. 323, 328 A fibrinopurulent exudate in the specimen overlying but separate from the mucosa is always abnormal. The clinician should be informed that ulcers are likely to be present in a more proximal location in the bowel. On a practical note, all inflammatory exudates should be examined under high magnification for trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica, because this is their preferred location and these organisms are easy to overlook.",

Therefore, diagnosis depends on recognition of characteristic changes in biopsy specimens. The primary histologic change of collagenous colitis consists of a patchy increase in the thickness of the subepithelial collagen plate (Fig. 23-62) . 367, 368 The normal colonic epithelial collagen layer measures approximately 5 \u00b5m in thickness, but in collagenous colitis it may increase to 10 \u00b5m or more. We use 15 \u00b5m as a morphologic cutoff point for collagenous colitis. A mild to moderate increase in chronic inflammatory cells including plasma cells and eosinophils expands the lamina propria. Patchy injury to the surface epithelium characterized by increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes, epithelial degeneration, and sloughing also occur. Atrophy, mucosal architectural distortion, and acute inflammation are usually not present or are minimal. 367, 369, 370 Read and colleagues 371 introduced the term microscopic colitis to describe patients with chronic watery diarrhea of unknown origin occurring in middle-aged (mean, 54 years) patients. As in collagenous colitis, the colonoscopic appearance and the barium enema were usually described as normal. Biopsy specimens demonstrated increased inflammatory cells in a pattern not specific for any established entity. 371 Since this initial report, investigators have refined the clinical and especially the histologic diagnostic criteria of lymphocytic colitis. 370, 372 The histologic changes include increased chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria and surface epithelium, degenerative changes of the surface epithelium, minimal architectural change, and minimal acute inflammation (Fig. 23-63) . The changes of lymphocytic colitis in general resemble the surface epithelial and lamina propria changes of collagenous colitis, and indeed changes identical to lymphocytic colitis are seen in biopsy specimens from patients with collagenous colitis when areas where the collagen plate is not well developed are sampled.",

The histologic similarities include increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, surface epithelial damage, and increased chronic inflammatory cells within the lamina propria. 369, 370, 373 Both collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis can be associated with other autoimmune phenomena such as thyroid disease, enteropathic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, and celiac sprue. 374, 375 Some cases of lymphocytic colitis demonstrate thickening of the subepithelial collagen plate, and distinguishing lymphocytic colitis from collagenous colitis may not be so clear-cut in all cases. 373 It appears likely that lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis are either the same or very similar conditions, perhaps representing different morphologic phases of one disease process. 370, 374 Some minor differences between lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis deserve mention, however. Collagenous colitis has been reported predominantly in women, whereas lymphocytic colitis affects men and women equally. 370, 376 Differences in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes between collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis have been described. 376 Finally, collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis differ histologically with the presence of the thickened collagen plate.",

A trial of bismuth compounds is worthwhile. Many times, symptomatic therapy has failed, thus necessitating the addition of antiinflammatory agents.

Both conditions have a striking histologic similarity to celiac sprue, a condition known to be autoimmune and possibly having a viral or infectious trigger. 370 In addition, both lymphocytic and collagenous colitis have been linked to other conditions thought to have autoimmune pathogenesis such as Crohn's disease, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, inflammatory arthropathies, pernicious anemia, small bowel villous atrophy, iritis, diabetes mellitus, and myasthenia gravis. 374, 384, 385 Both conditions respond dramatically to anti-inflammatory agents. 378, 379 The finding of \"lymphocytic colitis-like\" histologic features reported in an epidemic outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea linked to a water tank aboard a cruise ship supports an infectious trigger for some cases of lymphocytic colitis (see later).",

Colonic microscopic abnormalities in patients with celiac sprue occur after experimental exposure to wheat or gliadin enemas, a finding suggesting that the entire intestinal tract may be susceptible to gluten-induced injury. It is possible that in some patients with true celiac sprue (responsive to gluten withdrawal), occult dietary gluten reaches the colon and induces the histologic changes of lymphocytic colitis. However, approximately one half of the patients with spruelike small bowel lesions and lymphocytic colitis have not responded to gluten withdrawal.

A second outbreak occurred in Henderson County, Illinois in 1987, when 72 people developed watery diarrhea associated with drinking contaminated well water at a roadside restaurant. In each outbreak, patients underwent extensive diagnostic evaluations including comprehensive microbiologic studies of their stool and the implicated exposure site. Despite the workup, no causative agent was identified. The clinical and epidemiologic characteristics were typical of point-source epidemic infectious diarrhea. However, unlike in typical infectious diarrhea, these patients developed a chronic watery diarrhea syndrome with symptoms lasting longer than 6 months and often lasting for years.",

Colonic biopsy specimens revealed surface epithelial lymphocytosis without distortion of mucosal architecture, surface degenerative changes, or thickened subepithelial collagen plate. The degree of surface epithelial lymphocytosis was similar to that seen in cases of collagenous and lymphocytic colitis. 370, 394, 395 Many experts believe that patients with the clinical syndrome of chronic watery diarrhea of unknown origin and patients reported as having lymphocytic colitis represent a heterogeneous group that may contain persons with unrecognized Brainerd diarrhea. With long-term follow-up, cases of Brainerd diarrhea appear to be self-limited, and patients recover in less than 3 years. From a practical standpoint, surface epithelial lymphocyte counts should be performed on all colonic biopsy specimens from patients with chronic diarrhea, especially chronic watery diarrhea. Currently, Brainerd diarrhea cannot be recognized outside the setting of an epidemic.",

In addition, mucosal prolapse is often covert requiring special techniques such as evacuation cine proctography and defecography to demonstrate abnormalities in these patients. 352, 356, 401, 403 Ulcers, when present, typically occur on the anterior or anterolateral wall of the rectum, are irregular in shape, and often appear well demarcated. In patients without ulceration, the mucosa appears polypoid, roughened, or erythematous. Inflammatory cloacogenic polyp 398,399 involves the lower rectum and anal transition zone. The clinical impression in patients with mucosal prolapse syndromes is often incorrect and includes ulcer, Crohn's disease, nonspecific proctitis, carcinoma, and villous adenoma. 355 The characteristic histopathologic changes are found in the mucosa adjacent to the ulcers or in the polypoid areas and consist of fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria associated with mucosal architectural distortion often with a hyperplastic or villiform appearance (see Fig.  23 -60). [352] [353] [354] [355] 397 Inflammation is typically mild or absent and mucosal capillaries can be ectatic. Superficial erosions occasionally occur and can be associated with acute inflammation and the formation of inflammatory pseudomembranes. On occasion, colonic glands may be misplaced into the muscularis mucosae or submucosa, a histologic pattern referred to as localized colitis cystica profunda. Submucosal vessels may also be ectatic and hyalinized. The histologic features of specimens obtained from ulcerated areas appear nonspecific and usually show fibrinopurulent debris, fibrosis, and granulation tissue.",

Clinical history is also required to separate the rectal ulcers associated with the use of ergotamine suppositories from mucosal prolapse.

In general, these pouch procedures are contraindicated in patients with Crohn's disease because of increased morbidity such as fistula and abscess. 409 Furthermore, complications requiring pouch removal can result in loss of considerable lengths of small bowel, sometimes enough to cause short-bowel syndrome. In our experience, there is nothing quite like a pouch to bring out the Crohn's disease in someone.

            "text": "Accurate pathologic diagnosis of colonic IBD contributes greatly to patient care. In patients who have had subtotal colectomy, relaxed and thorough pathologic examination of the colectomy specimen to rule out Crohn's disease is pos-sible. A staged resection of the large bowel is still the safest and most advisable approach for patients with severe or fulminant colitis, even though it requires an additional operation to remove the rectum and a period with a temporary ileostomy. Although pathologic assessment and interpretation are more difficult in fulminant disease, the two-stage procedure still allows for a complete examination of the colectomy specimen before any contemplated pouch construction with ileal-anal anastomosis. Some surgeons do not consider two-stage proctocolectomy necessary for selected patients with colonic IBD. The one-stage operative approach therefore requires accurate preoperative diagnosis and emphasizes the importance of clinical evaluation, radiologic examination, endoscopic analysis, and proper interpretation of mucosal biopsy specimens (see earlier). 406 Pouch complications include inflammation, fistula, obstruction, incontinence, and anastomotic leaks. 406, 407 Although many complications result from surgical and mechanical difficulties, and others relate to the development of \"primary\" inflammation in the pouch (see \"Pouchitis,\" later), some of these complications represent pouch recurrence of initially unrecognized Crohn's disease. These cases illustrate the inability to differentiate UC from Crohn's disease reliably in severe colitis, even after thorough examination of the colectomy specimen. 410 All reports of surgical experience with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis for presumed UC contain approximately 2% to 7% of patients in whom the final diagnosis proves to be Crohn's disease. 406, [409] [410] [411] [412] We recommend use of a three-tiered classification system for primary IBD in colon resection specimens: UC, Crohn's disease, and IBD of indeterminate type. The definitive diagnosis of UC requires all the following features: diffuse disease limited to the large intestine, involvement of the rectum, more proximal colonic disease occurring in continuity with an involved rectum (i.e., no gross or histologic skip lesions), the absence of deep fissural ulcers, the absence of mural sinuses, and the absence of transmural lymphoid aggregates or granulomas (Fig. 23-65) . 406, 413, 414 The definitive diagnosis of Crohn's disease requires histologic verification with the demonstration of transmural lymphoid aggregates in an area not deeply ulcerated or the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas (Figs. 23-66 and 23-67). 406, [413] [414] [415] [416] When the gross and clinical features suggest Crohn's disease by the presence of skip lesions, linear ulcers, cobblestoning, fat wrapping, or terminal ileal inflammation, extensive histologic sampling to find the definitive histologic features of Crohn's disease is suggested (Fig. 23-68) .",

[424] [425] [426] [427] The changes reflect a physiologic response to stasis and the loss of trophic factors in the feces, most notably short-chain fatty acids. 428 Most patients are asymptomatic. The mucosa of the diverted segment appears erythematous, granular, and friable ( Fig. 23-71 ). Histologic changes include marked lymphoid hyperplasia with germinal center formation, usually accompanied by mild colitis with crypt abscess formation (Fig. 23-72) . These changes may be indistinguishable from follicular proctitis (ulcerative proctitis or localized UC). 429 With time, the muscularis mucosae hypertrophies, the submucosa shows fatty and fibrous tissue infiltration, the muscularis propria thickens, and the lumen becomes progressively smaller. 406 The mucosal lymphoid hyperplasia may be accompanied by lymphoid aggregates scattered in the deep submucosa and muscularis externa and may occur in diverted segments in patients without IBD. Care must be taken not to base a diagnosis of primary IBD, especially Crohn's disease, solely on the histologic changes seen in diverted specimens. In many patients, the rectum is placed out of circuit during an operation for primary IBD. In these instances, the rectum can show changes of both IBD and diversion. The histologic changes in a defunctioned rectum do not correlate with the original diagnosis or clinical outcome. 430 ",

            "text": "A late complication of Kock pouch and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is the development of \"primary\" inflammation in the pouch with its associated clinical syndrome termed pouchitis. 431, 432 The reported incidence ranges from 8% to 46%. This wide range may be the result of the lack of an accepted case definition of pouchitis. Patients generally experience nausea, vomiting, malaise, fever, and abdominal cramping. The increased effluent/stool from the pouch may be watery, foul smelling, or grossly bloody. Patients frequently become incontinent. Pouch bacterial ecology is often altered and many patients respond to antibiotics such as metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, a finding that suggests a bacterial cause in some cases. Some patients have required 5-aminosalicylates, sulfasalazine, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, or even pouch excision to manage symptoms. 432 Pouch biopsy may be performed to confirm the presence of inflammation or to evaluate the possibility of Crohn's disease. 433 Pouch biopsy specimens from nondysfunctional pouches can show mild villus shortening and increased chronic inflammation with augmented crypt proliferation. Most specimens from pouches that are functioning well resemble normal terminal ileum. A few neutrophils within surface epithelium and within the lamina propria are commonly seen in pouches that are functioning well. [432] [433] [434] [435] [436] In contrast, pouches with classic pouchitis show decreased epithelial mucin and decreased or absent lymphoid follicles. The most consistent finding in this classic form of pouchitis has been ulcers with granulation tissue and patchy accumulations of neutrophils within crypt epithelium and within the lamina propria with deep crypt abscess formation. 432, 433, 435, 437, 438 To define pouchitis more precisely, Sandborn proposed the Pouchitis Disease Activity Index. 432, 434 In this system, up to 12 points are awarded for various clinical and endoscopic findings. The amount of neutrophilic infiltration and the degree of ulceration are graded on a scale of 1 to 3 points each. Histologic findings are weighted in this system because pouchitis is diagnosed in patients who have 7 or more points.",

Confusion over pouchitis is easily understood when one considers that the clinical syndrome of pouchitis probably represents at least six different conditions (Table 23-8) . 406, 432, 433 The two variants of antibiotic-responsive pouchitis syndromes are classic pouchitis and jejunal bacterial overgrowth. 432, 433, 441 Classic pouchitis is associated with endoscopic and histologic findings that support the pouch as the source of clinical symptoms. [431] [432] [433] [434] 436, 439 Patients with classic pouchitis usually respond to antibiotics such as metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. Occasional patients with clinical symptoms of pouchitis have had endoscopically and histologically negative pouches but have responded to antibiotics. 431, 432 Although rare, some of these patients have had proximal jejunal bacterial overgrowth, 442 probably as a result of pouch distention causing an ileal brake phenomenon that decreases motility in the proximal intestine. 442, 443 This decreased motility may predispose some individuals to proximal small bowel bacterial overgrowth.",

            "text": "Pouchitis syndromes refractory to antibiotic therapy include irritable pouch syndrome, short-strip pouchitis (\"cuffitis\"), Crohn's disease, and chronic primary refractory pouchitis. 432, 433 Patients with irritable pouch syndrome may have severe clinical symptoms but demonstrate normal pouch endoscopy and histology. Some of these patients respond to dietary fiber supplements and antidepressant therapy. 432 To obtain a better-functioning pouch, many surgeons have abandoned rectal mucosectomy in the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis procedure. 432, 444 In short-strip pouch itis, clinical symptoms may be caused by exacerbation of UC in the small retained rectal segment. 432, 445 Many patients with this form of pouchitis have responded to topical corticosteroids or mesalamine. Although debated, 446 missed Crohn's disease is likely to manifest as a late pouch fistula or abscess rather than as refractory pouchitis. In occasional reported cases of refractory pouchitis, pouch biopsy specimens contained granulomas or the excised pouch showed histologic criteria for Crohn's disease. 414, 433, 436 Invariably, the original colectomy showed either missed Crohn's disease or colitis of an indeterminate type. 414 These cases are best classified as Crohn's disease. 406, 414, 433 Patients with chronic pouchitis should be investigated with endoscopy and biopsy to rule out Crohn's disease or CMV infection, which has been linked to some cases of refractory pouchitis. 432, 447 Routine biopsy specimens of the pouch should be examined as well as biopsy specimens of the afferent limb. Afferent limb ulcers tend to correlate with Crohn's disease and, in patients who do not have Crohn's disease, with the use of NSAIDs. 448 We have seen cases of refractory pouchitis requiring surgical removal of the pouch. After careful pathologic evaluation, no specific infection and no criteria for Crohn's disease can be found in either the excised pouch or the original colectomy specimen. 414, 433, 436 These cases are best categorized as primary refractory pouchitis. The causes of classic pouchitis and primary refractory pouchitis are unknown but are probably related to a combination of stasis, bacterial overgrowth, the abnormal immune response of patients with IBD, or perhaps associated colonic-type metaplasia, which is reported to occur in a minority of pouches (see later). 432, 433, 449 Some investigators have identified histologic patterns of mucosal adaptation in pouches. [450] [451] [452] Approximately 50% to 60% of patients exhibit what has been called type A mucosa with normal small bowel biopsy histology or only mild mucosal atrophy with no or minimal inflammation. Type B mucosa, characterized by transient atrophy with temporary moderate to severe inflammation followed by normalization of intestinal mucosa, is seen in 30% to 40% of patients. Type C mucosa with permanent persistent atrophy and severe inflammation occurs in up to 10% of pouches. Colonic-type features have been reported at least focally in pouches of all types by routine morphology, mucin histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, lectin binding, or electron microscopy. This colonic-type change is best developed in type C mucosa but is not complete. All pouches seem to retain mostly small bowel properties regardless of mucosal type or the duration of the pouch.",

These children present typically with rectal bleeding, sometimes with diarrhea. 462, 463 Colorectal biopsy specimens show increased numbers of eosinophils within the lamina propria, occasionally with focal active colitis. Biopsy specimens that contain more than 60 eosinophils per 10 high-power fields are suggestive of this disease. 463",

Histologic changes associated with chemotherapy and irradiation typically resolve in 7 to 10 days. 464, 466 Apoptotic colopathy identical to grade 1 GVHD can be seen in immunodeficiency syndromes, in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil, and in primary AIDS-related colitis.

            "text": "Several management options are available. First, the physician can ignore the risk. Many physicians prefer this approach when dealing with an older patient or a patient who is not otherwise a surgical candidate, especially if the actual cancer risk is believed to be low. 491 A second management approach is prophylactic colectomy in patients with colitis for longer than 8 to 10 years. 491 This may be the best approach when dealing with a young patient because of the expected long duration of cancer risk and the possibility that surveillance can fail. 489 Furthermore, the results of ileal pouch-anal anastomosis are better in young patients. Although prophylactic colectomy theoretically eliminates the cancer risk, several factors have made this approach generally unacceptable. Patients with extensive colitis for more than 8 to 10 years are often asymptomatic or have only mild disease. Such patients often find it difficult to accept the risks associated with major surgery, the possible morbidity associated with mobilizing the rectum, or the social implications of a permanent ileostomy (in the event of a pelvic pouch failure). Besides, most studies suggest that prophylactic colectomy would have been unnecessary in the majority of patients because they would not have developed carcinoma. 1, 484 A third option is colonoscopic surveillance with biopsy. The strategy of such surveillance is to identify a marker that signals a subgroup of patients with colitis who are at increased risk for carcinoma or the detection of carcinoma in an early, curable phase. 1, 484, 491 Currently, recognition of dysplasia in surveillance biopsy specimens is used as such a marker. Dysplasia, the presumed precancerous epithelial change, has been regularly recognized in colectomy specimens both adjacent to and distant from colitis-associated carcinomas. 1, 322 Circumstantial evidence suggests that dysplasia may not only be the marker for carcinoma but also may itself be the carcinoma in a preinvasive phase. 1, 322 Dysplastic epithelium can occur in grossly flat mucosa, in mucosa with a villous or plaquelike configuration, or in a nodular growth resembling adenoma (Fig. 23-74 ). 1 Dysplasia is recognized by histologic examination of biopsy specimens using well-defined cytologic criteria that include nuclear enlargement with hyperchromasia, increased mitotic figures, and decreased intracellular mucin. 1, 322 Most colitisassociated dysplasia resembles adenomas seen in patients without colitis.",

Although cells undergoing repair demonstrate nuclear enlargement with hyperchromasia, these nuclei are often evenly spaced and not crowded, round to oval with a smooth external nuclear contour, contain granular chromatin with a single or multiple chromocenter or nucleoli, and are remarkably similar to one another in size and appearance. In contrast to dysplasia, the nuclear-tocytoplasmic size ratio of regenerative cells is often actually decreased, especially in cells adjacent to ulcerated areas. During this phase, the cell cytoplasm is often eosinophilic. Nearby crypt abscesses or neutrophils within epithelium (cryptitis) help to confirm the diagnosis of repair. As a general rule, reparative epithelial change is limited to or accentuated in the crypt base and will not extend onto the surface of the crypt.",

The indefinite category also includes odd mucosal patterns of growth that have not yet been observed to give rise to carcinoma (e.g., sessile serrated polyp-like change [ Fig. 23-77 ], epithelial changes that resemble gastric foveolar epithelium). The category, indefinite for dysplasia, is a legitimate diagnosis alerting the treating physician that worrisome changes are present that may place a patient in a higher risk category that requires more frequent surveillance. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Dysplasia Morphology Group originally subdivided indefinite dysplasia into three groups: probably inflamma-tory, probably dysplastic, and unknown. 322 Obviously, in a category that is already uncertain, subcategorization is cumbersome, subjective, and associated with marked interobserver and intraobserver variation. Therefore, subdivision of biopsy specimens in the indefinite category is not recommended. 1",

            "text": "The use of 5-aminosalicylate compounds decreases the risk of cancer by 53% to 75%, 485, 493 as does seeing the physician regularly and having more than one colonoscopy. 493 Most patients and physicians opt for lifelong annual or biannual colonoscopic surveillance. 1, 485 Current practice guidelines recommend two to four biopsy specimens obtained every 10 cm throughout the diseased bowel in addition to special sampling of macroscopic lesions. 494 Compliance with this recommendation has been inadequate. [495] [496] [497] [498] Patients whose biopsy specimens remain negative for dysplasia can probably safely continue regular surveillance. Most authorities recommend annual total colonoscopic examination for patients with extensive UC who have had their disease for more than 8 to 10 years. 1, 322, 492, 497 The surveillance interval can be increased to 2 to 3 years for patients with negative initial colonoscopy because in only 2% to 4% of these patients has disease been shown to progress. 489 Patients demonstrating epithelial changes indefinite for dysplasia should have shorter follow-up (e.g., 6 months to 1 year). 488, 498 They must not be ignored because 28% of patients in whom the initial biopsy results were indefinite progressed to high-grade dysplasia and 9% progressed to cancer. 489 Management recommendations for patients with low-grade dysplasia in a flat mucosa are difficult because of the paucity of long-term follow-up information. Some clinicians consider it safe to continue short-term follow-up (e. g., 3 to 6 months) for patients with low-grade glandular dysplasia; 488, 498 if dysplasia persists 1, 497, 499, 500 or is associated with any suspicious gross lesion or stricture (dysplasiaassociated lesion or mass [DALM]), colectomy should be considered. 1, 322, 484, 501 Forty-three percent of reported patients with DALM already had carcinoma in immediate colectomy specimens. 489, 501 Increasing numbers of experts have advo- cated immediate colectomy for low-grade dysplasia. [487] [488] [489] 502 These experts have stated that 19% of patients with lowgrade dysplasia already had complicating carcinomas, and they also have cited a very high rate of progression to highgrade dysplasia or carcinoma with follow-up (54%, St. Marks, London; 53%, Mt. Sinai, New York; 33%, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn). 485 These data are questioned because of case selection bias. 489 If high-grade dysplasia is encountered, then colectomy should be recommended because the risk of concurrent carcinoma is estimated to be as high as 42%. 1, 489 Experience with surveillance biopsy interpretation has shown that truly negative results are rarely interpreted as dysplasia, and dysplasia, especially high-grade dysplasia, is rarely missed. 1, 492 That said, variations in interpretation do occur, 1,322,500,502-504 and in general confirmation of a biopsy diagnosis of dysplasia is desirable before colectomy. 1, 322 Any one or more of the following may be considered adequate confirmation: finding of dysplasia in a repeat biopsy from the same site, finding of dysplasia in one or more additional sites during the same endoscopic examination, or review and confirmation of the original dysplasia interpretation by another pathologist experienced with the classification system. 1, 322, 485 Surveillance endoscopy with biopsy has limitations. No compelling evidence proves that surveillance benefits the patient. 489, 491, 497, 503, 505 Participation in a surveillance program does not guarantee that lethal cancer will not develop. 488, 489, 491, 497, 500, 505, 506 Dysplasia is unusual and it is difficult for any one pathologist to acquire extensive experience. Therefore, errors in histologic interpretation can be expected. Dysplasia can be focal and is subject to tremendous sampling error. 1, 488, 492 Because most authorities consider dysplasia a neoplastic change, it is unlikely that it ever resolves spontaneously. Thus, a clinician should not be lulled into a false sense of security by negative follow-up biopsy results once true dysplasia has been identified. 1 Although not proved scientifically, it seems likely that patients benefit from surveillance programs because many carcinomas are detected in a curable phase. 1, 488, 497, 498, 500, 505 In addition, the incidence of carcinoma in patients whose biopsy specimen results have remained negative is low. 489, 497, 498 It is unclear whether this benefit justifies the large cost of surveillance endoscopy. 489, 507 Finally, surveillance programs are pointless unless the patient complies with regular surveillance and agrees to colectomy when the end point (dysplasia) has been reached. 507",

            "text": "Many groups have searched for other markers for precancer in UC. Sialomucins predominate in cancer and dysplasia in UC but the role of mucin histochemistry findings is debated. 508 Results of lectin binding, CEA immunohistochemical study, and immunohistochemical analysis for products of c-myc and ras oncogenes have produced variable results and could not reliably differentiate dysplasia from repair. 1 Several investigators described a correlation between DNA aneuploidy and dysplasia or carcinoma in UC. [509] [510] [511] However, only 80% to 90% of invasive carcinomas and 50% to 80% of dysplasia demonstrated DNA aneuploidy. This finding indicates that DNA analysis by flow cytometry could not be used alone in a cancer surveillance program. Many specimens (\u22656%) interpreted as negative or indefinite for dysplasia showed DNA aneuploidy. 510, 511 This finding can be interpreted in several ways. It could indicate technical problems linked to false-positive results including failure to disaggregate nuclear clumps, prolonged exposure of the sample to higher temperatures, and debris in the sample. 511, 512 Alternatively, this test could identify a subgroup of patients different from the group identified by dysplasia that is showing objective chromosomal abnormalities in the absence of recognizable dysplasia. It is tempting to speculate that this DNA aneuploidy could be used as a marker of some carcinomas complicating UC, although other investigators concluded that the detection of DNA aneuploidy was not useful as a predictor of the presence of concurrent carcinoma in UC. [509] [510] [511] Until large prospective studies determine the usefulness of DNA aneuploidy in UC, histologic dysplasia is still the only reliable marker for cancer in a surveillance program. 1,513,514 DNA analysis could benefit some patients. Patients with diploid DNA content and no signs of dysplasia probably can be examined at longer surveillance intervals. 510, 511 Approximately 90% of patients would fall into this category and a longer interval surveillance could save considerable amounts of money and time.",

Therefore, there is probably no reason that both conditions could not coexist. Because most IBDassociated dysplasias resemble adenomas, 1 the distinction in practice is often impossible. Management of patients with UC and adenoma has been controversial. Does the lesion represent a harmless sporadic adenoma or is it a dangerous DALM? In general, a pathologic diagnosis of \"adenoma\" in a patient with IBD must be carefully evaluated by the treating physician and should at least prompt further consultation with the pathologist because the lesion could represent IBD-associated dysplasia, an ominous change that implies a substantial risk for the development of carcinoma or for coexisting cancer. 1, 515 adenoma versus dysplasia-associated lesion or mass Dysplasia in IBD can be broadly classified endoscopically as flat or raised. Raised lesions can be further subdivided into adenoma-like (i.e., discrete, well-circumscribed sessile or pedunculated lesions that resemble sporadic adenomas [see Fig. 23-74] ) or non-adenoma-like (i.e., irregular plaque or masslike) lesions (Figs. 23-78 and 23-79). 1, 516 Most experts recommend colectomy for flat high-grade dysplasia and endoscopically raised non-adenoma-like dysplasia lesions. Correct management of patients with UC who have endoscopically adenoma-like dysplasia is not clear. The differential diagnosis between conventional adenoma and dysplastic lesions in IBD has been the focus of several publications. Distinction based on pathomorphologic features has been proposed. 517, 518 Although lesions can be classified histologically using this system, to date this approach has not been clinically validated. The study of Torres and colleagues 517 suggested that an admixture of normal and dysplastic glands at the surface of the lesion could be used to distinguish IBD-associated dysplasia from conventional adenoma. Several drawbacks to this study limit its clinical usefulness. An association with carcinoma or flat dysplasia was definitional for IBD-associated dysplasia in this study. Furthermore, the study had limited clinical follow-up to determine whether the distinction based on this feature (admixture of normal and dysplasia at the surface) was clinically relevant in patients not yet known to have other areas of dysplasia or carcinoma. Many authorities believe that admixtures of normal and dysplastic glands are so highly prevalent in sporadic adenomas that this criterion is not helpful in practice.",

            "text": "Immunohistochemistry has also been used in an attempt to discriminate between conventional adenoma and IBDassociated dysplasia. 520,521 p53 overexpression by immunohistochemical analysis that generally correlates with mutation of the corresponding tumor suppressor gene appears to be the most promising. p53 gene mutations reportedly occur earlier in IBD-associated dysplasia than in conventional adenoma or carcinoma. Therefore, strong p53 overexpression tends to correlate with IBD-associated dysplasia. Unfortunately, only 30% of IBD-associated dysplasias overexpress p53 (versus 5% of sporadic adenomas). 520, 521 This p53 testing is probably not sensitive enough for routine practice. Combining p53 immunoreactivity with betacatenin expression (which exploits the relatively low prevalence of APC gene mutation in IBD-associated dysplasia) or bcl-2 immunohistochemistry (which is more often overexpressed in sporadic adenomas) does not appear to improve the sensitivity or specificity of this approach. 520,521 Immunohistochemistry is clearly technically easier and more widely available. However, as with the molecular approaches outlined earlier, diagnoses based on immunohistochemistry have not been clinically validated. practical guide to patient management Pathomorphologic, molecular, or immunohistochemical testing could eventually separate harmless sporadic adenomas from the more ominous DALMs in patients with IBD but this remains to be proved. In the meantime, follow-up information is sufficient to guide a careful physician facing this dilemma. The most important criterion for stratification is the topographic relation of the adenoma-like lesion to areas of colitis. Adenoma-like lesions occurring in areas not affected by colitis histologically or endoscopically have not been associated with a high risk of concurrent or subsequent carcinoma. These lesions should be considered conventional adenomas and treated by polypectomy alone. 1, 516, 517, 520, 522 Management of adenoma-like lesions occurring in areas involved by colitis is more challenging. As many as two thirds of patients have had concurrent or subsequent invasive carcinoma at follow-up. 1, 515, 517, 523 From a practical standpoint, we believe that it is prudent to consider all adenoma-like lesions occurring in areas involved by colitis as potentially IBD-associated dysplasia lesions. These lesions must be excised endoscopically and not merely sampled with biopsy. 523 The diagnosis of IBD-associated dysplasia alone in this unique setting (adenoma-like dysplasia in a macroscopic polyp) may not necessarily be an indication for immediate colectomy. 1, 323, 498, [515] [516] [517] 520, 524 Endoscopic polypectomy alone may be adequate treatment provided that careful patient selection criteria are applied, including the following: (1) the patient is in an adenoma age group (>40 years of age), (2) the adenoma-like lesion is discretely defined macroscopically and can be excised in its entirety, (3) excision of the lesion appears complete to the endosco- pist, (4) no flat dysplasia is identified in the colon, and (5) the colon is easy to survey (i.e., compliant patient without inflammatory polyposis). Current data suggest that the majority of patients managed in this fashion will follow a clinically benign course. 1, 515, 516, [522] [523] [524] However, these patients must receive careful short-term surveillance. A 3-to 6month initial surveillance interval can be increased to 6 months to 1 year following negative results of colonoscopy. 516 Colectomy should be recommended for patients not fulfilling these selection criteria. 515",

The colonic carcinomas have been better differentiated than their small bowel counterparts in Crohn's disease, with an increased prevalence of mucinous histologic features. 1, 525, 526, 531 Reports using current histologic criteria almost invariably note dysplasia in the epithelium adjacent to small bowel and colonic carcinomas in Crohn's disease. 1, [525] [526] [527] 531 Dysplasia distant from carcinomas has also been encountered in specimens exhibiting both colonic carcinoma and Crohn's disease. These features suggest that the dysplasiacarcinoma sequence similar to that proposed for UC also occurs in Crohn's disease. 1,526,531 A practice-based surveillance study of 259 patients with Crohn's colitis affecting at least one third of the colon for more than 8 years found that 16% of patients developed dysplasia or cancer at 16 years. 533",

Retained rectal stumps are often strictured and inaccessible. The absolute number of colon carcinomas reported in Crohn's disease is still low, so again the expected yield of positive cases in a surveillance program would be quite small. Some experts advocate a UC-like surveillance strategy for patients with at least 8 years of Crohn's colitis involving at least one third of the colon. 485 Rather than ignoring the risk in Crohn's disease, options are available for a cautious clinician. 1, 534, 535 A patient with recrudescence of colitis-like symptoms and a background of long-standing inactive Crohn's colitis should be thoroughly investigated for carcinoma. 526 Yearly surveillance of an out-of-circuit rectum seems reasonable considering that approximately 20% of the reported cases of large bowel cancer in Crohn's disease have occurred in such segments. 534, 535 It may, however, be better to advise removal of the defunctioned rectum, especially if reanastomosis is not planned, not possible, or contraindicated. The presence of dysplasia in a biopsy specimen from a patient with Crohn's disease must alert the physician to the possibility of coexistent invasive carcinoma. In this situation, management approaches similar to those proposed for dysplasia in UC are recommended. 1, 321, 526 Clinicians should also recognize that chronic fistula or anal stricture in Crohn's disease may be complicated by squamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. 1, 530 Any abrupt change in the volume or nature of a fistula discharge or the development of an area of induration or mass near a fistula should be investigated with biopsy. 535",

Conversely, stenosis or occlusion of mesenteric arteries (even two of the three major vessels) does not establish a diagnosis of ischemia because these are frequent findings in asymptomatic patients. Therefore, the diagnosis of ischemic bowel disease requires a high index of clinical suspicion complemented by continued monitoring of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic information.

In contrast, acute arterial occlusion is likely to result in infarct. Considering anatomic factors, occlusion of a large vessel does not often result in ischemic damage because collateral circulation is usually adequate to protect the bowel. However, occlusion of smaller end arteries frequently results in segmental ischemic damage and infarct. 544 Finally, the mere existence of an entity referred to as nonocclusive intestinal ischemia emphasizes the importance of physiologic considerations. Systemic hypotension and bowel distention lead to marked decreases in splanchnic blood flow caused by vasoconstriction and arteriovenous shunting in the bowel wall. 544, 545 This phenomenon can result in widespread bowel infarct even in the presence of patent blood vessels.",

The list of differential diagnostic possibilities often overwhelms the pathologist and clinician. Keeping the diagnostic considerations in their proper perspective, almost all cases of mesenteric ischemia result from systemic hypotension or occlusion of a major blood vessel. 544 Knowledge of these relative frequencies can be invaluable in decreasing the pathologist's anxiety and frustration when dealing with these types of specimens and when interacting with the concerned clinician, patient, and family. Most ischemic episodes result from nonocclusive ischemic bowel disease (low-flow states) and in these cases no vascular lesion or specific cause for ischemia can be demonstrated on pathologic examination. Superior mesenteric artery embolism or thrombosis is usually diagnosed by radiography or at operation. Almost all significant superior mesenteric artery occlusions occur in the proximal 1 cm to 2 cm of the artery, 544 an area not likely to be present in a resection specimen; such occlusive plaques, thrombi, or emboli are either bypassed surgically or removed and submitted separately to the pathology laboratory. Mesenteric venous thrombosis is also diagnosed and identified at laparotomy and treated with thrombectomy.

Thus, ischemia can cause little or no change, mucosal plaques or hemorrhages with erosion, discrete or serpiginous ulcers that mimic Crohn's disease, strictures, or at the severe end of the spectrum, hemorrhagic infarct with perforation. Any part or length of bowel can be affected depending on the cause and duration of hypoxia and the state of the collateral circulation. In general, those cases of ischemic bowel disease associated with narrowing of a blood vessel show pathologic changes in the bowel in the corresponding distribution. In contrast, nonocclusive intestinal ischemia causes patchy and irregular distribution of damage not necessarily corresponding to an area supplied by a specific blood vessel (Fig. 23-82) . Ischemic damage associated with reduced blood flow shows a propensity to affect \"watershed zones\" such as the splenic flexure, which is the boundary between the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric artery distributions. 3, 347 Acute, organizing, and healed phases of ischemia can be recognized histologically. 347 Acute ischemic damage can be focal or diffuse. The characteristic pattern of acute injury consists of hemorrhage into the lamina propria associated with superficial epithelial coagulative necrosis, often with sparing of the deep portion of the intestinal crypt (see Fig.  23-59) . 3, 347 The mucosal distribution of these changes can be explained by the existence of a countercurrent exchange mechanism that has been suggested for intestinal mucosa. In the mucosa, a central arteriole carries blood luminally in a direction parallel to but opposite to the direction of blood flow in the draining mucosal venule. This situation causes a gradient in oxygen tension to form, with the luminal aspect of the bowel relatively hypoxic when compared with the crypt base. 546, 547 The changes of acute ischemia can occasionally be associated with more extensive necrosis of the epithelium, often associated with an attached inflammatory pseudomembrane. Surprisingly, acute and chronic inflammatory cells are typically minimal in acute ischemic damage. This finding helps to differentiate ischemic damage from changes seen in primary IBD. Depending on the severity and duration of the hypoxia, the acute change can be reversible or can proceed to mucosal ulcers, at which point the histologic features become relatively nonspecific. 548 With increasing severity and duration, ischemia can lead to full-thickness infarct with hemorrhage and coagulative necrosis involving all bowel layers.",

Again, hemosiderin deposits can be a helpful clue in recognizing the ischemic nature of the injury.",

Large segments of infarct or ischemic damage are usually caused by an occlusive lesion in a proximal segment of a large artery or vein. In other words, the offending vessel is not likely to be present in the resection specimen. Although one is unlikely to see specific vascular abnormality in the resection specimen, the blood vessels should be carefully dissected and many cross sections examined microscopically to detect vascular lesions such as atherosclerosis, embolus, thrombosis, or inflammation (vasculitis). The significance of vascular inflammation in areas of active ulcer and infarct is questionable because this \"vasculitis\" may be secondary. However, acute inflammation in vascular walls associated with fibrinoid necrosis found in apparently viable areas separated from an ulcerated and necrotic area by a margin of normal tissue may indicate systemic vasculitis.",

The disease usually occurs in babies younger than 10 days of age and symptoms usually develop after feeding has begun. The lesions resemble acute ischemic damage. 569, 570 Ulcers that can be patchy or diffuse occur and in general may affect any part of the GI tract. Preferred sites of involvement include the terminal ileum, right colon, and stomach. Histologically bland transmural necrosis occurs and may be associated with gas cysts within the bowel wall (pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis [PCI]) ( Fig. 23-84) .

[571] [572] [573] [574] The condition is fulminant segmental colitis that is often seen in patients with lymphoma or leukemia receiving immunosuppressive drug therapy, but it has also been seen in association with other chemotherapyinduced or non-neoplastic-induced neutropenias such as cyclic neutropenia. Many investigators consider this disorder a form of ischemic bowel disease, but increasing evidence implicates bacteria, especially Clostridium septicum, as causative agents. [575] [576] [577] [578] The pathogenesis is unclear but is likely to be multifactorial with neutropenia, altered mucosal integrity, ischemia, and infection all playing a role. The lesion can occur anywhere in the GI tract, but the preferred sites are cecum, right colon, and terminal ileum. The histologic picture combines infarct necrosis with profound secondary bacterial or fungal overgrowth and is often associated with a paucity of acute inflammatory cells. The prognosis is grave; however, reports of successful surgical and medical management have been published. 571, 572, 574, 575, 579 nonspecific ulcers of colon Investigators have reported benign cecal ulcers and segmental necrosis of the right colon in which the pathologic features are nonspecific or resemble ischemia. [580] [581] [582] The cause of many of these ulcers remains unclear. 580 Some may represent inflammatory changes or bleeding vascular lesions in right-sided diverticula. 582, 583 Many are associated with endstage renal disease, hemodialysis, renal or cardiac transplantation, and corticosteroid therapy. Some are clearly related to ischemia caused by low-flow states, which are known to occur in patients undergoing hemodialysis. 581 However, a strong correlation exists among cecal and terminal ileal ulcers, renal or cardiac transplantation, immunosuppression, and CMV infection. 584 The possible role of CMV in these ulcers is unknown. The exact cause of many colonic ulcers cannot be determined at present. 585 NSAID use should also be investigated. 586",

Histologically, the mucosa appears atrophic and similar (often identical) to that seen in chronic UC. Having said that, the basal plasmacytosis in the lamina propria characteristic of primary IBD is usually but not always absent. Ectatic mucosal capillaries with thrombosis and hyalinization are important histologic signs that can point to irradiation effect ( Fig. 23-86 ). Irradiation may be associated with fibrosis of any of the layers of the bowel wall. The fibrosis can appear dense and hyalinized and may contain large, atypical radiation fibroblasts. Vascular changes are often prominent. Blood vessels may be ectatic in the mucosa and submucosa. More commonly, however, one encounters marked intimal fibroplasia with hyaline thickening of the blood vessel walls that leads to luminal stenosis.",

Although the histologic features of colonic mucosal biopsy specimens can vary greatly in these infections from essentially normal to lesions mimicking idiopathic IBD, large numbers of specimens show active colitis, as outlined earlier in the chapter, that when seen should suggest infectious-type colitis. 3, 323, 324, [326] [327] [328] [602] [603] [604] [605] [606] [607] [608] The histologic finding usually consists of the focal active colitis pattern of injury with relative preservation of mucosal architecture except for edema. The active inflammation is associated with little or no mucin depletion. Neutrophils can be present within the lamina propria and scattered cryptitis and crypt abscess formation, sometimes with luminal accentuation, can be seen. The definitive diagnosis of infectious colitis requires laboratory documentation by culture, PCR on the paraffin block, or serologic examination. Histologic evaluation, although helpful in suggesting infection, can only rarely point to a specific agent. True granulomas can be seen in tuberculosis, syp hilis, Chlamydia species infection, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection. Microgranulomas are described in infection with Salmonella species, Campylobacter species, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Isolated mucosal giant cells are nonspecific but have been described in Chlamydia trachomatis infection. 330, 607 Some bacterial infections cause little inflammation but can be diagnosed by observation of adherent organisms such as with intestinal spirochetosis and adherent E. coli species. Although intestinal spirochetosis (infection with Brachyspira aalborgi or Brachyspira pilosicoli) can be seen in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or AIDS, 609, 610 it is more frequently encountered in immunocompetent patients in whom its significance remains controversial. 609, [611] [612] [613] [614] The microscopic appearance is subtle, consisting of a thickening or accentuation of the colonic brush border that stains deeply with hematoxylin. This effect is caused by adherent spirochetes that align in parallel and embed themselves in the absorptive cells. Identification can be enhanced by use of a Warthin-Starry (or other silver) stain. The organism also cross-reacts with Treponema species immunostains. Adherent E. coli infections, described in HIV/AIDS under the term diarrheogenic bacterial enterocolitis, are discussed later.",

Early lesions consist of a slight mucosal depression and erosion with adherent exudate containing trophozoites of E. histolytica (Fig. 23-88 ). Focal active colitis can also be seen. 608 More severe disease can cause ulcers that have been described as flask-shaped because they undermine the adjacent mucosa. E. histolytica is easily distinguished from the much larger Balantidium coli, which is only rarely seen in humans. 621 In addition, the trophozoite of B. coli is ciliated, the nucleus is much larger and kidney-shaped, and the cytoplasm contains vacuoles.",

In immunocompromised patients, the rhabdoid larvae may develop into the infective filiform larvae. These infective larvae may invade intact colonic mucosa or perianal skin and set up a cycle of infection referred to as autoinfection. Many such infections are severe and often fatal. In colorectal biopsy specimens the infective larvae can be seen usually associated with marked infiltration of mucosa with the eosinophils (Fig. 23-90) . 622 Sometimes an eosinophilic and granulomatous reaction can be seen in biopsy and resection specimens. 623 Occasionally intraluminal worms are encountered in the colonic lumen and are removed at colonoscopy.

C. difficile is more frequently identified in patients with IBD and may be linked to exacerbations of IBD and fulminant colitis. 639, 640 Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis usually develop during the administration of antibiotics but in up to one third of patients, the onset of symptoms can be delayed for up to 4 to 6 weeks; occasionally, no antibiotic exposure has occurred. 630, 636, 641, 642 The characteristic endoscopic and histologic lesion is found early in the course of the disease and only in some individuals. The surface of the mucosa is covered by a plaquelike, cream-colored to yellow pseudomembrane ( Fig. 23-94) . The intervening mucosa frequently appears normal but can be hyperemic or edematous. 345 With increasing severity, the membranes can become confluent and linear ulcers can develop. Usually the pseudomembranes are evenly distributed throughout the colon but in up to one third of patients, the pseudomembranes can be confined to the right colon. This finding emphasizes the need for total colonoscopy to make an endoscopic diagnosis.",

Saccharomyces boulardii was shown to decrease the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea but did not change the rate of C. difficile colonization. Another provocative approach to prevention is to restrict the use of newer antibiotics such as third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in the hospital setting. 632, 638 Patients with C. difficile-associated pseudomembranous colitis who are treated specifically show a 95% to 100% response rate usually with defervescence in 1 to 2 days and resolution of diarrhea in 5 days. However, 5% to 50% of patients have a relapse and relapse treatment can be challenging. Most investigators recommend a second course of the same antibiotic (metronidazole or vancomycin) for 14 days. 645 For a second recurrence, tapered-pulsed vancomycin is advised. 630 For a third or subsequent recurrence, a probiotic or toxin binder is added to tapered-pulsed vancomycin therapy. Newer treatments for recurrences include passive immunoglobulin therapy, toxin receptor decoys (e.g., tolevamer), and active immunization against toxin A. 645 Stool culture for C. difficile is usually not recommended but some investigators report a significantly higher yield of positive results based on fecal culture followed by toxin assay on positive colonies. 646 Cell culture assay for toxin B is not routinely performed. Results of latex agglutination tests have been disappointing. 647 Enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIAs) that detect toxin A (Meridian Diagnostic, Vitec, BD, and Cambridge) or toxin A and toxin B are widely used. 630 These assays have a 90% to 95% positive correlation with cell culture assay. Commercially available tests that detect toxin A and toxin B are preferred because 1% to 2% of C. difficile strains produce only toxin B. 629, 630 An alternative and more sensitive but slower approach is to perform an EIA for the detection of common antigen (a highly sensitive marker for C. difficile) followed by a cytotoxic assay if the results of the EIA are positive. 630 Various gene probes and PCR techniques that detect toxin at the DNA level are available for research purposes. 648 enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli-associated colitis",

In 1983, investigation of hemorrhagic colitis outbreaks occurring in Oregon and Michigan implicated a then-rare serotype of E. coli, O157:H7, as the cause of the syndrome. 650 Subsequently, investigations of several additional outbreaks confirmed the association between hemorrhagic colitis and the verocytotoxin-producing E. coli, the most important of which is E. coli O157:H7. 651 Patients with hemorrhagic colitis typically present with the sudden onset of crampy abdominal pain occurring 3 to 4 days after ingestion of contaminated food, usually undercooked hamburger. Outbreaks have also been linked to other foods, drinking water, and swimming pools. 652 Watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting follow within hours. One to 2 days later, grossly bloody diarrhea replaces the watery diarrhea. In almost all patients, the disease resolves spontaneously, usually within 8 days. Investigation of the epidemic outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 infection revealed that not all patients acquire the full syndrome of hemorrhagic colitis. Rather, a clinical spectrum exists ranging from asymptomatic carrier or self-limited nonbloody diarrhea to severe cases complicated by hemolytic-uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 651, 653, 654 E. coli O157:H7 produces several toxins active against vero cells (verocytotoxins) and HeLa cells that have been termed Shiga-like toxins because their mode of action is similar to that of the toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae type I. The toxins interact with the membrane receptor globotriosyl ceramide, are apparently absorbed into epithelial and endothelial cells, and cause damage or cell death by interfering with protein synthesis. 651, 655 Colonic histologic features in EHEC infection are the best documented of the diarrheogenic E. coli organisms because EHEC infection can lead to hospitalization and it clinically mimics ischemia and primary IBD, thus prompting colonoscopy with biopsy. 346, 656, 657 Colonoscopy typically demonstrates patchy erythema, edema, and surface ulceration of the colon (Fig. 23-96) . The cecum and right colon are usually described as markedly abnormal, whereas the descending colon typically has mild or no changes. Histologically, specimens usually show hemorrhage and edema within the lamina propria. Specimens most often show focal necrosis associated with hemorrhage and acute inflammation within the superficial mucosa with preservation of the deep colonic crypts, similar to the pattern of injury described in acute ischemic colitis. Specimens from many patients show neutrophils infiltrating the lamina propria and crypts resembling the focal active colitis pattern of injury seen in infectious colitis or acute self-limited colitis ( Fig. 23-97 ). Rarely patients also demonstrate inflammatory pseudomembranes. This combination of ischemic-like and infectious-like injury with capillary thrombi should at least suggest EHEC-associated colitis in biopsy specimens.",

However, surprisingly little is known about the histopathologic features of the human gut infection. Information remains scant because most infectious diarrheas, being self-limited, do not require specific treatment even when an infectious organism is identified. Therefore, sophisticated diagnostic tests such as organism identification, virulence factor determination, and endoscopy with biopsy are reserved for outbreaks or for cases with unusual features (e.g., severe or protracted diarrhea, systemic symptoms, need for hospitalization, or a differential diagnosis including serious diseases such as primary IBD or ischemia).",

Electron microscopic study has shown adherent bacteria in cell culture with a normal microvillous structure. In the colon, EAEC produces cytotoxic effects ultrastructurally (microvillous vesic- ulation, enlarged crypt openings, creation of intercrypt crevices, and mucosal epithelial cell extrusion). 667 The most detailed description of human ileal and colorectal infection with EPEC, EAEC, and possibly DAEC probably is found in a published review of patients with AIDS. 668 Unfortunately, the exquisite light and electron microscopic descriptions of these diarrheogenic bacterial enterocolitides were not complemented by microbiologic studies. Therefore, identification of these organisms as E. coli rests on the pathologic similarity to other reported cases and preliminary isolation studies that have shown that at least some of these cases were caused by EAEC and DAEC. 668 The colonic histologic pattern showed surface epithelial degeneration with adherent bacteria (some extremely subtle) without colonic architectural distortion or significant inflammation. Electron microscopic examination demonstrated three patterns: (1) typical adhering and effacing lesions (as with EPEC), (2) a loosely adherent pattern with effacement (as with EAEC), and (3) an intercalated pattern with effacement in which vertically oriented bacteria were seen burrowing between intact microvilli. The intercalated pattern could be DAEC in vivo because it is similar to the pictures and descriptions of DAEC in other in vitro and animal models. 666 ",

Many of the neuronal and axonal changes are subtle; with the exception of inflammatory neuropathies 675 and some neuropathies associated with intranuclear or intracytoplasmic inclusions (e.g., red cytoplasmic inclusions in ganglion cells of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy), 677 they cannot be recognized in routine H&E-stained sections. Difficult and unusual cases should probably be referred for consultation to pathology departments with particular expertise in the evaluation of visceral neuropathies. That said, referral is rarely indicated clinically. Some sporadic cases demonstrate mononuclear inflammation in the myenteric plexuses, and these cases can be identified by routine light microscopy. 678, 679 Some of these cases are manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes often linked to small cell carcinoma of the lung. 680 Others are postinfectious. 675 The inflammatory neuropathies can sometimes cause acquired aganglionosis and can be associated with circulating antibodies, such as anti-Hu, (ANNA-1, antineuronal nuclear antibody-1), anti-Ri, and anti-Yo (Purkinje cell cytoplasmic autoantibody). 680, 681 An acquired form of hypoganglionosis associated with buserelin-induced formation of anti-GnRH (anti-gonadotropin-releasing hormone) antibodies has been reported. 682 Investigators now recognize the role interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) play as gut pacemakers and as mediators of neurotransmission. 683, 684 ICCs stain specifically with the tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit. 685 Immunohistochemical analysis for c-kit (CD117) and for CD34 (which reacts with many c-kit receptors) represents a relatively easy way to study severe constipation and intestinal pseudoobstruction. Streutker and colleagues 685 described completely absent or markedly reduced numbers of ICCs in some cases of intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Reduced volumes of ICCs have also been described in some patients with slow-transit constipation. [685] [686] [687] [688] [689] Although the observations could be an epiphenomenon, they could form the basis of an alternate classification system for these cases.",

Melanosis coli has been associated with increased apoptosis, which is often linked to ingestion of purgatives of the anthracene group (Cascara sagrada, aloe, rhubarb, senna, frangula).

[698] [699] [700] [701] Because these patients almost invariably take laxatives, melanosis coli is usually found. What is so frustrating to the pathologist is that by H&E staining, the neuronal plexus and smooth muscle in these patients appear normal. Distinctive abnormalities of the myenteric plexuses (e.g., loss of \"argyrophilic\" neurons) have been reported using special silver staining techniques. 673, 693, 701, 702 These tests are best performed by pathology departments with expertise in this area.

Reports suggest that many cases of Hirschsprung's disease have a genetic basis. Both Hirschsprung's disease and MEN2 are associated with mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. [704] [705] [706] In cases of MEN2, the mutations are activating and enhance the function of the coded protein, whereas in Hirschsprung's disease the mutations are inactivating. Several cases of familial Hirschsprung's disease have been linked to mutations of the endothelin receptor-B (ENDRB) gene. 707 At least nine additional genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung's disease: NTN (seen only with RET mutations), GDNF, EDN3, ECE-1, SOX10, PHOX2B, ZFHX1B, L1CAM, and 7DHCR. 706 Despite this progress, mutations of one or more of the known genes are detected in only half the patients with Hirschsprung's disease.",

In Hirschsprung's disease, examination using the acetylcholinesterase stain demonstrates increased acetylcholinesterase-positive nerve fibers in the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae. The utility of this technique as an adjunct to diagnosis is debated. False-positive and false-negative reactions have been reported, and the use of this method is a matter of personal preference. [711] [712] [713] Occasionally, ganglion cells may be difficult to identify using light microscopy alone, especially in the neonate. 708 In such cases, a positive immunohistochemical reaction for neuron-specific enolase can be valuable in documenting ganglion cells. 714 We have been successful in performing immunohistochemical analysis for neuron-specific enolase on sections after they have been stained with H&E and examined. Other immunostains such as cathepsin D, PGP 9.5 (protein gene product 9.5), RET, BMPR1A (bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1A), and bcl-2 decorate ganglion cells. 710, 715 Frozen section is often used as an adjunct to visual inspection to select the site for colostomy. However, use of the frozen section to establish a primary diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease is best avoided because of the high rate of incorrect interpretations. 716",

Intestinal neuronal dysplasia may occur in a localized or disseminated form. Similar lesions sometimes referred to as ganglioneuromatosis can be observed in patients with von Recklinghausen's disease or MEN2B. 673, 722, 723 Although some clinicians diagnose intestinal neuronal dysplasia based on abnormal acetylcholinesterase staining in specimens containing ganglion cells, others believe that one cannot rely on acetylcholinesterase staining alone for the diagnosis. 727 Diagnostic criteria for intestinal neuronal dysplasia and even its very existence are challenged 727,728 because 95% of infants so diagnosed experience normalization of gut motility within 1 year. Therefore, many of the observed \"abnormalities\" could be within normal range and in general the diagnosis should be reserved for florid pathologic cases. 729",
