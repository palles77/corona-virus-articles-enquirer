Previous studies demonstrated that MMTV could induce pH 5-dependent fusionfrom-with of mouse cells. Here we show that the MMTV envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion requires both the entry receptor and low pH (pH 5). Although expression of the MMTV envelope and TfR1 was sufficient to mediate low pH-dependent syncytia formation, virus infection required trafficking to a low pH compartment; infection was independent of cathepsin-mediated proteolysis. Human TfR1 did not support virus infection, although envelope-mediated syncytia formation occurred with human cells after pH 5 treatment and this fusion depended on TfR1 expression. However, although the MMTV envelope bound human TfR1, virus was only internalized and trafficked to a low pH compartment in cells expressing mouse TfR1. Thus, while human TfR1 supported cell-cell fusion, because it was not internalized when bound to MMTV, it did not function as an entry receptor. Our data suggest that MMTV uses TfR1 for all steps of entry: cell attachment, induction of the conformational changes in Env required for membrane fusion and internalization to an appropriate acidic compartment.",

Whether a similar infectious agent exists in humans has been a subject of debate since the discovery of MMTV. There have been reports that continuous passage of MMTV on human breast cancer cell lines resulted in adapted viruses that could infect human cells (Howard and Schlom, 1980; Lasfargues et al., 1979) and more recently, Indik et al. reported infection of several human cell lines with a GFP-marked MMTV (Indik et al., 2005) . Additionally, several groups have detected MMTV-like sequences in up to 40% of human breast cancer samples, but not normal tissue (Etkind et al., 2000; Ford et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2001; Pogo et al., 1999; Szabo et al., 2005; Wang et al., 1995; Zammarchi et al., 2006) . MMTV-like sequences have also been detected in patients with the autoimmune disease, primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (Xu et al., 2003) . Other groups, however, have been unable to find such sequences (Bindra et al., 2007; Mant et al., 2004; Selmi et al., 2004) .",

We also show that although MMTV uses mTfR1 and not hTfR1 for infection, low pH induced cell-cell fusion occurred on human cells that express the MMTV envelope (Env) and both Env and hTfR1 were required for this event. However, MMTV was unable to mediate internalization of hTfR1. Thus, because MMTV requires trafficking to a low pH compartment to enter cells, it was unable to infect human cells despite engaging the hTfR1 receptor.

To further examine the pH requirements of MMTV infection, we used a cell-cell fusion assay similar to that described by Redmond et al. with the Mm5MT murine mammary carcinoma cell line, derived from an MMTV-induced mammary tumor (Redmond et al., 1984) . Mm5MT cells were grown in the presence or absence of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone to induce viral protein expression ( Fig. 1A ) and then treated with pH 5 media for 15 min; we determined experimentally that 15 min incubation gave the highest levels of fusion (not shown). Only dexamethasone-induced cells expressing high levels of Env and treated with pH 5 media showed syncytia Mm5MT cells were grown in the presence (Dex+) or absence (Dex\u2212) of dexamethasone for 24 h and exposed to pH 5 or pH 7 media. A Western blot of cell extracts from duplicate wells grown in the absence or presence of dexamethasone probed with anti-SU antisera is also shown. (B and C) Maximum cell-cell fusion pH occurs at pH 5. Mm5MT cells induced overnight with dexamethasone were treated with media at the indicated pH. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were stained with Giemsa and the percentage of cells in syncytia (B) and the number of nuclei/syncytium (C) were determined by counting. Fig. 2 . Low pH treatment does not inactivate MMTV or release virus from the cell. (A) Pseudovirions were incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C at the indicated pH, neutralized and then used to infect mTfR1/293T cells. (B) Low pH does not release virus from the cell surface. Pseudoviruses were incubated with mTfR1/293T cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, pulsed at the indicated pH and then infection at 37\u00b0C was allowed to proceed. Colonies were counted 48 h later. formation; hormone-stimulated cells that expressed the same levels of Env but incubated at pH 7 demonstrated no syncytia (Fig. 1A) .",

NMuMG cells (normal mouse mammary gland cells that express mTfR1) were incubated with MMTV on ice for 1 h, shifted to 37\u00b0C for 15 min, then fixed and immunostained with anti-MMTV and anti-EEA1 or anti-rab 7 antibodies, which are markers of early and late endosomal compartments, respectively. MMTV was detected in both compartments, indicating that virus efficiently enters this pathway and consistent with the pH 5 requirement for Env-mediated cell-cell fusion (Fig. 3A) . We also found that mTfR1 co-localized with a GFPtagged version of the early endosomal marker rab5 in the presence or absence of virus, while it only was found in the same compartment as a rab7-GFP (late endosomal marker) in the presence of virus (not shown).

Treatment with either drug dramatically reduced the level of infection compared to cells that underwent the same infection protocol in the absence of drug (Fig.  4B ). We also tested whether MMTV required two-step activation of fusion at the plasma membrane as is needed for ASLV (Barnard et al., 2006; Delos et al., 2005; Matsuyama et al., 2004) . MMTV was incubated with mTfR1/293T cells at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of bafilomycin A, the media was removed and then the cells were treated with pH 7 or pH 5 buffer for 15 min at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4C ).

We co-transfected 293T cells with expression vectors containing the MMTV Env together with wild type hTfR1 or a chimeric molecule, hTfR1-MTM52. MTM52 has a hTfR1 backbone, but contains amino acids 285-296 and seven amino acid substitutions Fig. 4 . MMTV requires trafficking to a low pH compartment to infect cells. (A) mTfR1/ 293T cells were treated with nocodazole at the indicated concentrations for 1 h and then infected with MMTV pseudovirions in the presence of drug. (B) mTfR1/293T cells were pretreated with either bafilomycin A (BFA) or nocodazole (noc) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with MMTV at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by treatment with different pH buffers in presence of BFA or nocodazole at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. The cells were washed, incubated in media containing BFA or nocodazole for two more hours and then refed. Forty-eight hours later, DNA was isolated and subjected to RT-qPCR. (C) mTfR1/ 293T cells were pretreated with BFA at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, then incubated with MMTV at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by treatment with different pH buffers in presence of BFA at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. The cells were washed, incubated in media containing BFA for two more hours and then refed. Forty-eight hours later, DNA was isolated and subjected to RT-qPCR. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the transfected cells, as well as untransfected controls, were infected with MMTV Env-or VSV G-pseudovirions. Colonies were counted 48 h later. Data is presented as the percent infection relative to untransfected cells. Shown is the average of 2 wells; this experiment was repeated 3 times with similar results. in the region from amino acids 569-589 from mTfR1. Introduction of these changes into the extra-cellular domain of hTfR1 renders it capable of serving as an MMTV entry receptor (Wang et al., 2006) . Surprisingly, the MMTV Env induced syncytia formation to similar extents in cells expressing either hTfR1 or MTM52; indeed, Env also caused 293T cells expressing only endogenous levels of TfR1 to fuse after pH 5 treatment (Fig. 7A) . Moreover, the MMTV Env induced syncytia on D17 dog and CFRK cat cells after pH 5 treatment (not shown); neither the dog nor the cat TfR1 support MMTV pseudovirus infection (Wang et al., 2006) .",

However, the cell-cell fusion data presented in the preceding section indicated that MMTV might bind hTfR1. To determine if this was the case, we performed co-transfection/co-immunoprecipitation studies with expression plasmids encoding the MMTV Env, hTfR1 or MTM52 (Wang et al., 2006) . When anti-MMTV Env antiserum was used for the immunoprecipitation step and anti-hTfR1 antibodies for the detection step, equal levels of both MTM52 and hTfR1 were precipitated, even under high stringency conditions (0.5 M KI) (Fig. 8) .

In its normal metabolic role, TfR1 traffics first to the sorting endosome (\u223cpH 6) upon binding diferric Tf and then moves either directly or via the recycling endosome (also \u223cpH 6) back to the surface where apo-Tf is released. Given that MMTV Env-mediated membrane fusion occurs at pH 5 but not pH 6 and its association with the late endosome (Fig. 3A) , it is likely that binding of virus re-targets TfR1 to this compartment. Indeed, our preliminary studies indicate that this is the case (not shown). MMTV may re-direct TfR1 to the late endosome to gain better access to the nucleus, since the sorting endosome is believed to be located in the cell periphery, while the late and recycling endosomes are found in the perinuclear region.",

            "text": "TfR1 endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits has been shown to require a number of molecules, including TTP and Eps15. TTP is a newly identified molecule which has been shown to be important for internalization of TfR1, probably through its interaction with dynamin (Tosoni et al., 2005) . We have also found that over-expression of a dominant-negative form of dynamin had little or no effect on MMTV infection (not shown). Eps15, which is associated with the adaptor protein AP-2, has been implicated in the endocytosis and entry of a number of enveloped viruses, including Sindbis virus and VSV (Carbone et al., 1997; Sun et al., 2005) . However, MMTV infection occurred at almost wild type levels in cells expressing the dominantnegative Eps15, indicating that its trafficking to the late endosome is largely independent of the normal endocytic pathway taken by TfR1. Several other viruses, notably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and mouse hepatitis virus 2 (MHV2), which like MMTV require a bpH 5.5 compartment for entry, have recently been shown to infect cells in the presence of the dominant-negative Eps15 (Pu and Zhang, 2008; Wang et al., 2008) . Interestingly, it has been previously suggested that intra-cellular trafficking of TfR1 depends not only on targeting sequences found in the receptor but also on the particular ligand bound to the receptor, since a genetically engineered Tf that bound to a different region of the receptor redirected it to the lysosome and targeted it for degradation (Zaliauskiene et al., 2002) . Since MMTV interacts with a region of TfR1 distinct from Tf, it is possible that the virus also re-directs the receptor from the early recycling endosome to a more acidic compartment. 293T cells were transfected with MMTV Env expression vector and treated with pH 5.0 media to induce syncytia or 427 cells transfected with MoMLV Q123 expression vector were grown to confluence. The enlarged area within the box is shown in the far right panels. (D) Syncytia induction requires a receptor binding-competent Env. 293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding wild type Env or Env-FS, which has a point mutation in the receptor binding site (Zhang et al., 2003) . Low pH treatment was performed 48 h after transfection Env and the number of syncytia/ 20,000 cells was counted. Inset: Western blot analysis with anti-MMTV antiserum was Fig. 8 . MMTV SU binds both mTfR1 and hTfR1. (A) Human 293T cells were transfected with Env, hTfR1 or MTM52 alone, or Env was co-transfected with hTfR1 and MTM52. Immunoprecipitations of cell lysates were performed with goat anti-MMTV antiserum and Western blots were probed with the anti-hTfR1 monoclonal antibody OKT-9 (IP); cell lysates were also analyzed by Western blots to examine the level of TfR1 expression (lysates). The co-immunoprecipitations were performed at 4\u00b0C in the presence of 0.5 M KI. We show here that unlike many other enveloped viruses, while binding to receptor and low pH are necessary, they are not sufficient for MMTV infection. Infection by several viruses, including Ebola, MLV, Hendra and the SARS and MHV coronaviruses have been shown to require cleavage by cysteine proteases located in the late endosome/ lysosome, such as cathepsin B and L, to achieve efficient infection (Chandran et al., 2005; Kaletsky et al., 2007; Kumar et al., 2007; Pager and Dutch, 2005; Qiu et al., 2006; Schornberg et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2005) . However, we found no evidence that MMTV required cleavage by such enzymes, since neither specific inhibitors of cathepsin (E46d) or more general protease inhibitors (leupeptin, aprotinin, etc.) affected MMTV infection levels. Kumar et al. have also suggested that MLV might require cathepsins at a post-membrane fusion stage of infection, since they found that VSV G/MLV pseudotype infection of NIH3T3 cells was inhibited by cathepsin inhibitor III and CA-074 (Kumar et al., 2007) . In our studies, VSV G/MLV pseudotype infection was not affected by any of the cathepsin inhibitors; this difference could be due to our use of NMuMG (mouse mammary epithelial) and 293T (human kidney epithelial) cells as opposed to NIH3T3 cells used in the previous study.",

Previously we showed that MMTV used mouse but not human TfR1 as its entry receptor and that the regions of receptor required for infection mapped to two segments that formed a potential binding site consisting of a unique charged amino aciddistribution pattern (Wang et al., 2006) . However, here we show that MMTV binds both human and mouse TfR1 (Fig. 8) and that the Env protein mediates cell-cell fusion in its presence at low pH (Fig. 7) . However, neither infectious virus particles nor pseudovirions were capable of triggering receptor internalization (Fig. 9 ). Although the MMTV Env binds hTfR1 even under high stringency conditions, it is possible that binding is weaker than to the mouse receptor. Thus, under the conditions of high Env expression achieved after transfection, there would be a sufficient number of Env molecules that undergo the conformational change required to induce Env-mediated cell-cell fusion. Alternatively, MMTV may bind to a site on hTfR1 that does not trigger receptor internalization via the YTRF motif in the cytoplasmic tail; the YTRF motif has been shown to be important for Tf-mediated TfR1 endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (Collawn et al., 1993) .",

Importantly, we show here that to achieve entry, MMTV must direct the TfR1 not to its normal recycling compartment, but to a lower pH compartment such as the late endosome/lysosome. Why does MMTV require trafficking with TfR1 to a pH 5 compartment? Clearly, neither receptor binding nor low pH is sufficient, since virus did not enter cells that express elevated levels of human or mouse TfR1 at the cell surface even when incubated at pH 5. Marsh and Bron have previously reported that fusion at the cell surface does not allow Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infection and suggested that the trafficking to an endocytic compartment could provide a means for bringing viral particles to sites in the cell where replication can proceed (Marsh and Bron, 1997) . It is also possible there are late endosomal co-factors or co-receptors other than cathepsins that are necessary for infection by MMTV and other viruses, a possibility which is currently under investigation.",

Twenty-four hours later, the cells were refed with medium containing 10 ng/ml sodium butyrate to induce expression of the CMV promoterdriven genes. Twenty-four hours later, cell lysates were prepared by incubating cells in 0.5 M KI co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M KI, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 \u03bcg/ml Protease inhibitor cocktail, Sigma at St. Louis, MO). Goat anti-MMTV antisera was added to the lysates and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The immune complexes were precipitated with Protein G agarose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and proteins eluted in SDS-protein loading buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by Western blotting, as previously described (Zhang et al., 2003) . Hybridoma supernatant OKT-9 (a gift from Morrie Birnbaum) was used to detect hTfR1 and MTM52 and monoclonal anti-SU to detect MMTV. For whole cell lysates, the blots were stripped and probed with anti-human beta-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.).",
