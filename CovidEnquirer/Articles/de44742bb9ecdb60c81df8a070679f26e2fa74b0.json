It involved 25 partners from 12 countries. In this paper, we describe the organization of the project and the culture created by its multidisciplinary essence. We discuss the main thematic sections of the project and the strategy adopted to optimize the integration of various scientific fields into a common objective: to obtain crystal structures of the widest variety of RNA virus replication enzymes documented and validated as potential drug targets. We discuss the thematic sections and their overall organization, their successes and bottlenecks around the protein production pipeline, the \"low hanging fruit\" strategy, and measures directed to problem solving. We discuss possible future options for such large-scale projects in the area of antiviral drug design. In a series of accompanying papers in Antiviral Research, the project and its achievements are presented for each virus family.",

It was the first large-scale, multicountry, co-ordinated research initiative to address the challenging concept families/genus regarding mainly viral genomics, structural biology and their use in drug design, with a special emphasis on what has been achieved within the VIZIER project. Alphaviruses , coronaviruses (Hilgenfeld et al., this issue) , flaviviruses , Picornaviruses (Norder et al., this issue) , caliciviruses (Rohayem et al., this issue) , arenaviruses and bunyaviruses (Charrel et al., this issue) , and rhabdoviruses (Assenberg et al., this issue) have their chapters, while ommissions reflect either a deliberate choice at the start of the project (eg., hepatitis C virus, orthomyxoviruses) or at the VIZIER symposium writing stage. For ommitted viruses, although interesting and sometime truly original results have been obtained within VIZIER, the amount of acquired data did not justify a full chapter (eg., reoviruses, astroviruses, paramyxoviruses, . . .) . In addition, a method chapter is included in the symposium. Indeed, specialized bio-informatics or crystallographic methods have been developed to satisfy VIZIER's special needs. We believe that these methods and tools are difficult to publish in a context other than the VIZIER symposium, but they surely deserve special mention, because they might be useful for the growing structural virology community.",

During the course of the project, the original concept expanded to its present form resting mainly on three scientific fields: (i) a strong \"viral genomics\" component, (ii) the original \"structural genomics\" core, and (iii) an integrated drug candidate discovery activity including chemists looping back to basic virology labs for mechanistic and proof-ofconcept studies.",

Second, due to their structural and mechanistic conservation across viral families, replication enzymes are less prone to variation than structural proteins. In theory, this should facilitate the subsequent selection of broadspectrum antiviral molecules, as well as minimise the emergence of drug resistance. Third, viral replication enzymes are often unique or divergent enough from host enzymes to expect decent drug selectivity, minimizing potential toxicity due to cross-inhibition of host enzymes. These enzymes thus constitute so-called \"validated targets\" in the drug discovery and design field.",

The first, which focused on the archaebacteria Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Christendat et al., 2000) was followed by other initiatives driven by large consortia in Europe (SPINE, http://www.spineurope.org/), Japan (RIKEN, http://www.rsgi.riken.go.jp/), the USA (PSI, http://kb.psi-structuralgenomics.org/) or transatlantic (SGC, http://www.sgc.utoronto.ca/).

This expression means that the \"easy\" targets, ie., proteins proceeding without any major difficulty up to structural analysis, were addressed first. In that respect, VIZIER introduced a new variation in the meaning of the expression. For example, only two proteins, the NS3 and NS5 enzymes that are central to replication were considered in the Flavivirus genus. Consequently, a major goal was to obtain at least one crystal structure for any Flavivirus NS3 or NS5, or sub-domains. The term \"low hanging fruit\" would then refer to the first determined of those, which would in turn help to solve as many other related NS3 or NS5 as possible along the flaviviral phylogenetic tree. The \"low hanging\" target was therefore considered as a template to accelerate structure determination inside a viral genus or inside a class of enzymes.",

Indeed, once a first crystal structure is known, structural homologues are usually not as exciting as original unknown proteins bearing the potential to reveal a novel fold. Nevertheless, the pan-viral approach made it possible to hit several birds with one stone! Indeed, viral genomes being smallsized compared to eukaryotic genomes, the pan-viral approach was a \"must\" to be eligible to a structural genomics denomination (and funding). First, it backed the concept of anticipating emerging viruses (see below). Second, it made it possible to try to produce or crystallize proteins of different isolates, enhancing the chances of success. A posteriori, the structural data in complement to the largescale sequencing (viral genomics) within viral families may help to address the inevitable questions about polymorphisms and drug susceptibility/resistance, as has already occurred with the influenza neuramidase and HIV enzymes.",

If crystal structures are determined for each virus family, then if a new virus should emerge, its replication enzymes will resemble something that has already been characterized at the structural level, and there might already be an initial drug candidate. In fact, this concept was exemplified by coronavirus research before and during the SARS crisis. In 2002, the Hilgenfeld group (L\u00fcbeck University, Germany) and collaborators had determined the TGEV main proteinase structure, the first coronavirus protein crystal structure (Anand et al., 2002) . The structural virology field was very young for coronaviruses, in line with most RNA viruses. Interestingly, this structural biology work provided an example of \"scientific anticipation\" directed towards getting the necessary scientific knowledge to design drugs against emerging RNA viruses. Indeed, TGEV protease inhibitors could be suggested based on the chloromethylketone pharmacophore, due to the active site similarity found with the rhinovirus 3Cpro. When the SARS-CoV emerged, the nucleotide sequence of this new coronavirus was made available on the internet shortly after virus isolation and identification (Marra et al., 2003) . It took only days for Dr. Hilgenfeld to figure out that the SARS protease was closely related to that of TGEV, and to propose both a structural model and that the TGEV inhibitor backbone could serve as a potent starting point for anti-SARS-CoV drug design . Six months later, the structure of the SARS-CoV main protease structure was solved .",

One obvious end-line is the unpredictable nature of medicinal chemistry involved in hit-to-lead development. Any discovered hit for which structure-based chemistry has to be implemented would require specialized chemists. It seemed more appropriate to subcontract this secondary chemistry, rather than try to integrate all fields of medicinal chemistry into the VIZIER program.

Duplication of effort is avoided and the optimal flow and feedback of information are facilitated, as well as sharing protocols and technical improvements through the database server. However, a central pipeline bears the obvious limitation of sequential organisation and dependence. If a single bottleneck appears somewhere in the pipeline, all of the downstream activity groups are at risk of being affected. Ideally, the pipeline has to run at an appropriate steady-state to irrigate various activities.

Domain definition had thus the first virtue of avoiding inter-or connecting domains which bring flexibility to a target in solution, impeding crystallization. It was also observed that the expression level of a multi-domain protein is not the algebraic sum of separated domain expression levels. As an example, the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the flavivirus NS5 express separately to high levels, but the comparative expression of the full-length protein is considerably decreased. The reasons may be multiple (eg., protein degradation and/or cleavage, gene expression Care et al., 2008) and related to flexibility, but the full-length protein, when available, has proven less amenable to crystallization despite intense efforts in several labs.",

Three reasons could explain these differences between (+) and (\u2212) ssRNA viruses. First, several structural modules of (+) ssRNA virus were already available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), rendering domain design easy, whereas no structural data was available on (\u2212) ssRNA viral replicases. Second, most of the (+) ssRNA viral non-structural proteins are processed by a protease suggesting that small modules could behave independently from others. In (\u2212) ssRNA virus nonstructural proteins (nsp) no proteolysis occurs and the different domains may need to interact with each other, and may be unstable when produced alone.

It is apparent that the viral genomics activity, which was slow at the beginning of the project, later generated more material for the pipeline than it was able to handle! From a practical point of view, cloning and expressing a gene with many unexpected mutations or polymorphisms reduces the enthusiasm of any motivated scientist who is aiming to publish his results in a scientific paper. This is a notorious limitation for those who work on loosely characterized viral isolates, which have been subjected to many passages in cell culture. The genomics strategy included the need to sequence closely related strains of viruses. This decision was totally vindicated by the observation that closely related strains of the same virus show different characteristics when challenged with potential inhibitors of enzyme activity. These observations also led to the conclusion that future work will require greater emphasis on field isolates of viruses, to avoid the risk of designing antivirals targeting only laboratory strains. Thus, since viruses are amongst the most genetically variable organisms, we now recognise the need to study authentic field isolates whenever possible. This genomics strategy also emphasised the fact that the pre-VIZIER viral world present in the databases as whole genome nucleic acid sequences was wholly inadequate.",

Indeed, it might well be that one protein that was resistant to expression or crystallization could be expressed and crystallized from a closely related isolate. In that case, the first crystal structure in an unknown viral family invariably represents a breakthrough. Later on, other related crystal structures are greatly facilitated through molecular replacement techniques making use of the first atomic coordinates. One may think that in terms of visibility and impact, subsequent crystal structures are less interesting for the crystallographer. It was found in many instances, however, that other original structure determination could come from various subsequent targets, expanding interest beyond the first-ever structure determined for a given virus family (Table 1) . And from a virologist or epidemiologist point of Table 2 Comparison of success rates on targets addressed in several structural genomics projects (as reported in the Target DB) versus VIZIER. Success rates are indicated for each step along the protein production pipeline up to crystal structure determination. view, any structure is potentially interesting, so long as it covers a phylogenetic space or describes an emerging virus. An unexpected demand from virologists was the wish to be included in the loop when an interesting drug candidate was found at the last stage of the VIZIER pipeline. This logical demand found two main justifications afterward: not only the virology labs were amongst the best qualified partners to assess drug susceptibility spectra on the largest virus collection, but it definitely helped to cement the VIZIER community, by making people from different backgrounds meet and work together. Fig. 1 shows that target amplification yielded 2214 cDNAs through RT-PCR from 2421 proposed sequences. In fact, the targets accounting for the difference (2421-2214) were either not addressed or addressed only once. Several expression systems were initially chosen as possible expression systems for viral proteins . To that aim, cDNAs were cloned into a set of expression vectors using ligation-independent cloning methods (Walhout et al., 2000; Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990) . A library made of 1790 cloned cDNA was built during the project, leading to a large, diverse and well documented resource of viral domains involved in replication. Cloning was a rather efficient step (1790 clones obtained represents a success rate of 80.8%), due to robust ligationindependent procedures that are commercially available. In that respect, large-scale cloning campaigns minimize the handling of freeze-thaw sensitive reagents, perhaps contributing to a rather straightforward and successful step. Noteworthy, the cloning success is evaluated upon sequencing bona fide cDNA inserts. Cloning was considered a failure in less than 20% of the cases. Failure was assessed by the absence of any recombinant colonies or the presence of an incorrect cDNA insert (unexpected stop codons, frameshifts, deletions generated by RT-PCR or PCR steps).",

Combining these multiple starts and stops leads to the cloning of constructs with different lengths for a given domain.

It is particularly interesting to note that the Parana virus L1 protein domain led to crystals whose maximum resolution could not be lowered below 8 \u00c5. Coupling both multi-constructs and multi-homologues strategy overcame this difficulty with the LCMV protein which provided crystals diffracting to 2.7 \u00c5. Fig. 1 shows that the most significant bottleneck remains the expression of soluble protein domains. The success rate of this step is about 30%, whereas expectations were 20% (300 out of 1500), mainly established after examination of the SPINE (European project preceding VIZIER) statistics and data provided by TargetDB (http://targetdb.pdb.org/) (see Table 2 ). The next stepprotein purification -did not use the parallel and semi-automated approach since each protein purification is unique and virtually needs individual care by a dedicated researcher. At this stage, some proteins were purified to homogeneity on the protein platform, and others were transferred to crystallography labs which repeatedly prepared protein batches for crystallogenesis experiments. The gap observed here (28% of the proteins remaining unpurified) is again in line with the data provided by the SG consortia (see Table 2 ).",

            "text": "Once the crystal structure of the first protein of its kind or virus family has been determined, interest tends to drop among the crystallographer community, as mentioned above. Therefore, several crystals of the same type of protein (eg., a Picornavirus 3D polymerase, a flavivirus MTase, etc. . .) may well remain unattended for a while, or forever, because their solution is judged not to be worth the challenge! Nevertheless, quality diffraction remains a significant problem. Even though the crystallization drop set-up can be automated, the whole optimization process is labor-intensive and requires full attention from a dedicated investigator, just as classical structural biology projects. Interestingly, some difficult problems were solved by dedicated scientists highly specialized on software for crystal structure determination, as well as crystal structure determination of challenging targets. This was the case for the West Nile RdRp and the VPg-3D RdRp Coxsackie virus complex (Gruez et al., 2008) , for which a large proportion of amino acids were ill-defined in the structural model, the arenavirus L1 protein domain whose phases could not be easily found, and the coronavirus SUD domain (Tan et al., 2009 ). The availability of dedicated software whose improved beta versions were made available prior to dissemination in the structural biology community surely helped to solve or improve structural models generated in VIZIER. In addition, a variety of tools were developed to help analysis of the structural models generated in the project (Gorbalenya et al., this issue) . Positive-stranded RNA viruses -and especially flaviviruses and the Nidovirales -provided the largest number of structures from the replication complex, as shown in Table 3 . For the flaviviruses, the project contributed to the structure determination of all four functional domains of the replication machinery (i.e., the protease, NTPase/helicase, methyltransferase and RNA dependent RNA polymerase), as well as providing additional data regarding the organization of the replication complex. No new fold or original structure was expected in this flavivirus sub-project, but all these targets are essential for viral replication and are thus good candidates for antiviral discovery (further detailed in the following reviews: Sampath and Padmanabhan (2009), Chappell et al. (2008) , Dong et al. (2008) , Malet et al. (2008) ). Each new structure may thus have a direct impact in the antiviral discovery field.",

Among the 13 structures determined, all are from Orf1a. No structure was obtained from Orf1b within VIZIER. Nevertheless, the production of soluble proteins of Orf1b enabled functional and biochemical studies (Decroly et al., 2008; Nedialkova et al., 2009) . One of the most striking observations that could be made from the structure results concerns the macro-domains. At the beginning of the project, the crystal structure of the SARS macro-domain was already available (Egloff et al., 2006) . Moreover, macro-domains were thought to be dispensable for viral replication (Putics et al., 2005) and may be not good candidates for antiviral discovery/design. It could be thus questionable to focus on these domains and their production and structure determination, even though these domains belong to the \"low hanging fruit\" category. Actually, the structural and functional study of 5 more macro-domains showed significant structural differences in substrate affinity and selectivity amongst coronaviruses (Tan et al., 2009; Piotrowski et al., 2009) . The invested efforts for coronavirus macro-domain design and production were helpful alphavirus macro-domain definition and crystallization . Although many structures are available now but the macro-domain role remains elusive, it is certainly much easier to tackle function assessment using reverse genetics in the alphavirus genus than in coronavirus. Indeed, infectious clones or subgenomic replicons are less labor-intensive in the former than in the latter genus. This example illustrates a possible benefit from a pan-virus analysis rather than relying on a unique virus model.",

For this exception, the structural work and the associated enzymatic work complemented each other in order to unravel both the first crystal structure for a viral family (Astroviridae) and the first demonstration of protease activity . In that case, structure and activity of this viral family is clearly lagging behind more studied viruses. As indicated above, one VIZIER concept is to stay aware that any RNA virus may emerge in the near future. In that respect, and although Astroviridae work performed in VIZIER could not justify a full chapter in this issue, the human pathogenic astrovirus serine protease crystal structure determined at 2.0 \u00c5 resolution may one day speed up drug design. In the case of RdRps, for example, the details of initiation of RNA synthesis are quite diverse in the RNA virus world. Initiation may be primer-independent (eg., flaviviruses), primer-dependent (eg., arenaviruses), protein-primed (eg., picornaviruses), or just unknown (eg., coronaviruses). There are several examples in VIZIER of unexpected results that may have some relevance to drug design. For example, the Coxsackie virus 3D RdRp structure was determined in complex with VPg (Gruez et al., 2008) and found to form a complex different from that of the foot-and-mouth virus 3D RdRp-VPg complex (Ferrer-Orta et al., 2006) . Also, the calicivirus RdRp polymerase structure suggested enzyme experiments which showed that caliciviruses can initiate RNA synthesis both in a primer-independent and independent manner (Fullerton et al., 2007) .",

The crystal structure determination of L protein domains involved in the replication of (\u2212) ss RNA viruses was probably the most challenging objective of the project since no structure was available at the start of the project. Several hundreds of L and other protein constructs from a large and diverse virus collection were expressed in E. coli and insect cells, contributing to lower the pipeline statistics: only five crystal structures were determined and, amongst them two domains from L proteins. The first one is the N-terminal part of LCMV (referred as (\u2212) ss RNA virus with segmented genome in Table 3 ). The structural data did not yet relate this domain to any known fold from the PDB and provided only few evidences regarding its function.

Alternatively, the VIZIER crystal structures provided first choice material to understand the mode of action of compounds discovered in partner labs during VIZIER-independent screening campaigns.",

Indeed, selecting and growing mutant viruses resistant to a drug allows mapping with precision a site of action. The availability of structures becomes a significant advantage for drug design. In some cases, data mining identified old drugs that led to renewed interest for a target once precise mapping was achieved (Norder et al., this issue) . In the picornavirus case, the discovery of drug candidates preceded high-resolution structural work on the 2C protein . The first crystal structure of this essential enzyme will certainly boost the development of drugs targeting this type of enzyme, presumably a SF3 helicase.",

Most importantly, the vast majority -if not all -of the crystal structures published have been documented with functional assays. This fact deviates from the idea that such a structural genomics project simply dumps technological data into a common unanalysed resource, as if largescale nucleotide sequencing would just produce un-annotated sequences. These crystal structures undoubtedly represent valuable information that may or may not be useful for antiviral design in the future, but often represent the first structural scientific knowledge obtained on neglected virus families. The infinite beauty and imagination of nature in protein architecture and enzyme mechanisms will last much longer than a project that has generated enthusiasm and results, and has perhaps contributed to attracting young talents to a multidisciplinary virology science.",
