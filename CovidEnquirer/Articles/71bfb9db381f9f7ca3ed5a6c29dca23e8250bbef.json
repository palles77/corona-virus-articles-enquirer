By comparing the 155 survivors with positive SARS-CoV IgG antibody results and DLCO > 80% predicted with the 50 patients with negative SARS-CoV IgG results, we found that 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality had endured a much longer course of fever and received larger doses of glucocorticoid, as well as higher ratios of oxygen inhalation and noninvasive ventilation treatment. For these patients, 51 of 53 patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and a lung diffusion abnormality underwent pulmonary function testing after approximately 1 month. DLCO improved in 80.4% of patients (41 of 51 patients). Of the patients with a lung diffusion abnormality, 40 of 51 patients showed lung fibrotic changes in the lung image examination and 22 patients (55%) showed improvement in lung fibrotic changes 1 month later. Conclusion: These findings suggest that lung fibrotic changes caused by SARS disease occurred mostly in severely sick patients and may be self-rehabilitated. DLCO scores might be more sensitive than HRCT when evaluating lung fibrotic changes. (CHEST 2005; 127:2119 -2124)",

Three nonblinded radiologists with a viewing console assessed all CXR and CT images, with the final conclusions established by consensus. Each segment of the lung was reviewed for ground-glass opacification, interstitial thickening, bronchiectasis, and architectural distortion. Abnormalities were magnified by using a zoom function and were examined for intralobular interstitial, interlobular septal, or peribronchovascular interstitial thickening. The presence or absence of nodules or masses, cavitation or calcification, and emphysema was also noted. The presence of parenchymal bands, irregular interfaces (bronchovascular, pleural, or mediastinal), thickened interstitium, and traction bronchiectasis were evidence of fibrotic changes. 4",

The wells with polystyrene microplate strips were coated with two recombinant SARS-CoV antigens that are well characterized. The serum was diluted in diluent buffer (1:10), incubated in the coated wells for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, and the wells were washed five times with washing buffer. The enzymelabeled antihuman IgG working dilution (100 L) was added, incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C, and washed five times with washing buffer. A tetramethyl-benzidine substrate was then added to each well. The presence of specific antibodies was indicated by the presence of a yellow color after substrate addition. Reaction was terminated by addition of hydrochloric acid. The intensity of the color was measured spectrophotometrically at 450 nm in proportion to the amount of antibodies in the specimen. The optical density (OD) obtained on the y-axis was plotted against the lot-specific standard concentrations on the x-axis, resulting in a linear calibration curve. The OD values of the positive control and negative control were calculated. The cut-off value for IgG was 0.18, which was calculated as the mean \u03e9 2 SD of the readings given by 1,000 blood donor control sera. If the OD value was above the cut-off value, it indicated a positive result for SARS-CoV IgG. 5",

            "text": "SARS-CoV infects the human body through the respiratory tract and replicates in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and pneumocytes. The host's immune response to SARS-CoV infection leads to lymphocyte production and to macrophage infiltra- tion into the alveolar septa and interstitial compartments. In patients with severe SARS, pulmonary lesions may progress into the proliferating and fibrosis phases. In the proliferating phase, cellular components such as myofibroblasts and fibroblasts produce collagen type III and collagen type I. 1, 6 In the rehabilitating phase, some patients still have lung fibrotic changes and complain of limited physical function from general weakness and/or shortness of breath affecting their pulmonary functions and life quality. 7, 8 During follow-up visits, we found that the rehabilitating SARS patients did not express persistence of SARS virus infection, as detected by SARS-CoV RNA examination, and the results showed that the rehabilitating patients did not have infectivity. In our study, 50 of 258 patients (19.4%) showed negative SARS-CoV IgG antibody results in at least two examinations, hinting that they might have been misdiagnosed. Both the Chinese clinical diagnosis standard (2003) 3 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SARS case definition (2003) 9 emphasize the importance of epidemiologic history, clinical manifestation, and CXR changes on clinically diagnosed SARS disease. In the laboratory test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SARS case definition especially emphasizes the importance on confirming SARS through detecting the dynamic changes of titrations of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV and positive detection of SARS-CoV RNA by PCR, but the Chinese clinical diagnosis standard does not mentioned the importance of laboratory SARS-CoV testing in SARS case confirmation. This might cause the existence of misdiagnosed SARS cases. Therefore, in the retrospective and follow-up study, we excluded these cases to ensure data accuracy. In our study, we found that there were 53 of 208 patients (25.5%) whose SARS-CoV IgG antibody results positive and also had a pulmonary diffusion abnormality (Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted). Analyzing the results of the second pulmonary function examination and comparing them to the results of the first showed that most of these patients (41 of 51 patients, 80.4%) had improved pulmonary diffusion function (p \u03ed 0.0003). Of the rehabilitating patients with pulmonary radiologic residue caused by SARS disease presenting as pulmonary fibrotic changes, 22 of 40 patients (55%) showed improvement on the HRCT scan in a month. This suggests that the mechanism of lung injury and lung fibrotic changes caused by SARS-CoV might have a different pathophysiologic process as compared to other diseases in the lung. SARS patients with lung fibrotic changes seem to have the ability of self-rehabilitation, and a pulmonary diffusion test might be more sensitive than HRCT on evaluating lung fibrotic changes (80.4% vs 55%). We think that the radiologic resolution of pneumonic process may lag behind the clinical picture. Although this study was limited to only approximately a 2-month followup, the lung function test reflected an earlier resolution of diffusion impairments compared with HRCT.",

The duration of fever, dosage of glucocorticoid usage, fraction of inspired oxygen, and number of NIPPV treatments in the patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG results and Dlco \u03fd 80% predicted were also longer. This may explain why older SARS patients had more severe symptoms than the younger patients. In spite of more aggressive therapy methods, the sequelae rates in the older rehabilitating SARS patients presented higher rates of lung fibrotic changes. 10, 11 In conclusion, SARS is associated with considerable rates of morbidity and mortality in the acute phase. A significant proportion of patients surviving the acute illness have impairment in overall functional capacity and health status in the first few months after discharge from the hospital. However, the long-term effect is still largely unknown. It is necessary to follow-up on these patients for some time with comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management, in case any persistent or emerging sequelae exist. ",
