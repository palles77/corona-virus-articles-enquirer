            "text": "Purpose: Activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) present on circulating monocytes in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) can lead to the production of proinflammatory cytokines and interleukin-10 (IL-10). We aimed to determine the association of the frequency of circulating TLR2+/ CD14+ monocytes (FTLR2%) with the outcomes of KD, as well as to compare FTLR2% to the usefulness of sIL-10. Methods: The FTLR2% in patients with KD was measured by flow cytometry. Serum levels of IL-10 (sIL-10) were determined in 31 patients with KD before the initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and in 21 febrile controls by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients were classified as having coronary artery lesions (CALs) based on the maximal internal diameters of the proximal right coronary artery and proximal left anterior descending coronary artery one month after the initial diagnosis. Results: We found that FTLR2% greater than 92.62% predicted CALs with 80% sensitivity and 68.4% specificity, whereas FTLR2% more than 94.61% predicted IVIG resistance with 66.7% sensitivity and 71.4% specificity. Moreover, sIL-10 more than 15.52 pg/mL predicted CALs and IVIG resistance with 40% and 66.7% sensitivity, respectively, and 73.7% and 76.2% specificity, respectively. Conclusion: We showed that measuring FTLR2% before the initial treatment could be useful in predicting CAL development with better sensitivity than sIL-10 and with results comparable to sIL-10 results for the prediction of IVIG resistance in patients with KD. However, further studies are necessary to validate FTLR2% as a marker of prognosis and severity of KD.",

            "text": "Thirtyone children diagnosed with KD at CHA University Bundang Medical Center, between November 2007 and November 2008, were enrolled in this study. All enrolled patients met the following criteria for complete KD: fever and at least 4 of the fol lowing 5 clinical symptoms-rash, conjunctival injection, cervical lymphadenopathy, changes in the oral mucosa, and changes in the extremities; or fever and 3 of the above clinical symptoms plus coronary artery abnormalities (dilatation or aneurysm) documented by echocardiography 4) . Children who presented with incomplete KD were excluded from our study. To exclude other febrile illnesses resembling KD, we determined the serum titers of antistreptolysin O, antiEpsteinBarr vi ral, anti mumps viral, and antimycoplasma antibodies in all samples from patients with KD. Furthermore, we performed multiplex polymerase chain reaction on nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from patients with KD, for common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, influ enza virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus). We also perform ed neck ultrasonography on these patients to rule out suppurative lymphadenitis. All patients received 2 g/kg IVIG in a single dose at the time of diagnosis and were treated with high doses of oral aspirin (80 mg/kg/day), until they became afebrile for 3 to 4 days, as specified in the 2004 American Heart Associa tion guidelines 4) . Afterwards, they were given low doses of aspirin (5 mg/kg/day). Serial echocardiography was performed on all patients with KD at the time of diagnosis and 1 month later, to study CAL development in the acute stage of KD. Echocardiography was conducted on all patients by a single cardiologist to evaluate the pre sence of structural heart diseases as well as to obtain M mode echocardiographic parameters, in cluding left ventricular enddiastolic dimensions (LVEDD), left ventricular endsystolic dimensions (LVESD), and fractional shortening (FS). We measured the internal diameter of the proxi mal right coronary artery (RCA) and proximal left anterior des cending coronary artery (LAD) to classify patients with CAL development (CAL (+)) and those who without CAL development (CAL (\u2212)). We did not include the measu rements of the left main coronary arteries (LMCAs), as normal anatomic variations in LMCAs have been reported to be frequent, and the probability of isolated dilatation of LMCA without accom panying dilatation of LAD has been reported to be low 22) . The z scores of coronary arteries were obtained using RCA and LAD measurements as well as the nonlinear regression equations based on the body surface area (BSA) 22) . To calculate the z scores of RCA and LAD measurements, we derived the predicted values of RCA and LAD measurements for a patient with a given BSA using the following regression equations, reported by McCrindle et al. 22 The z scores were calculated by dividing the differences between the actual measurements of RCA and LAD and the cor responding predicted values by the corresponding standard devi ations, as described by McCrindle et al. 22) . CAL (+) patients had dilated (2.5 \u2264z score<4.0) or aneurysmal (focal or diffuse dilatation of a coronary artery segment with z score \u22654.0) coronary arteries, based on the maximal internal diameters of the RCA and LAD one month after the initial diagnosis. CAL (\u2212) patients had normal (z score <2.5) coronary arteries one month after the initial diagnosis 4) .",

We found that sIL10 before treatment in the CAL (+) group was not significantly higher than that in the CAL () group. The reason for this finding might be that, in our study, patients be longing to the CAL (+) group were those that had developed CALs at one month after diagnosis. High sIL10 at the acute stage of KD might have had a cumulative beneficial effect on the inflammation of the coronaries past the acute stage of KD, as IL10 is known to have both antiinflammatory and proinflammatory properties 19, 20) .",

Additio n ally, our results showed that sensitivity in predicting IVIG resistance in patients with KD was comparable between FTLR2% before initial treatment and sIL10. One of the numerous mechanisms of ac tion of IVIG in KD is the inhibition of NF\u03baB activation in CD14 + macrophages and monocytes after IVIG therapy 28) . Because NF \u03baB is involved in the downstream TLR signaling path way, this may indicate that in IVIG nonresponders, the increased FTLR2% before the initial treatment would lead to increased acti vation of NF\u03baB, thus requiring additional treatment with IVIG, but further studies are needed to confirm this. In addition to the known predictive markers of IVIG resistance 7, 8) , monitoring FTLR2% could be useful in predicting IVIG resistance in patients with KD. Early identifica tion of patients at risk of CAL development and IVIG resistance, by monitoring FTLR2%, could supplement existing guidelines for additional intensive treatment strategies, such as the early combi nation of corticosteroid therapy in addition to the initial IVIG treat ment as proposed by Kobayashi et al. 7) , early in the course of KD.",

Another limitation might be the relatively shortterm followup of our patients, as CALs can form after 1 month of onset of the disease. Additionally, as this was a prospective study, the FTLR2% and sIL10 before the initial treatment could have affected the subsequent results of the echocardiograms taken 1 month later. Moreover, the regulation and interaction of TLRs and inflammatory cytokines occur in a complex manner 12) ; therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate how FTLR2% and sIL10 correlate. We did not separate monocytes from the whole blood in our study, therefore a small number of cells other than monocytes may have been analyzed. However, in accordance with the aim of this study, that is to establish FTLR2% as a potential marker of KD severity and prognosis, we thought that the use of whole blood samples served as an easier and more appropriate approach. Furthermore, the CAL (\u2212) group showed increased FTLR2% after the initial treatment compared to the CAL (+) group. We pro pose that, with time, other endogenous TLR2 ligands might be responsible for the delayed stimulation of TLR2, in addition to the initial stimulus responsible for the early activation 12) . This finding may limit the use of FTLR2% as a prognostic parameter after the initial treatment. Our study focused on the acute changes in CALs in KD at disease onset, so further longterm followup studies will be needed to elucidate the longterm effects of TLR2 on coronary arteries in KD. Additional investigations of ligands capable of TLR2 activation in KD would be helpful.",
