            "text": "Canine non-rabies combined vaccines are widely used to protect animals from infectious agents, and also play an important role in public health. We performed a large-scale survey to investigate vaccine-associated adverse events (VAAEs), including anaphylaxis, in Japan by distributing questionnaires on VAAEs to veterinary hospitals from April 1, 2006 through May 31, 2007. Valid responses were obtained for 57,300 vaccinated dogs at 573 animal hospitals; we obtained VAAEs information for last 100 vaccinated dogs in each veterinary hospital. We found that of the 57,300, 359 dogs showed VAAEs. Of the 359 dogs, death was observed in 1, anaphylaxis in 41, dermatological signs in 244, gastrointestinal signs in 160, and other signs in 106. Onset of VAAEs was mostly observed within 12 h after vaccination (n = 299, 83.3%). In this study, anaphylaxis events occurred within 60 min after vaccination, and about half of these events occurred within 5 min (n = 19, 46.3%). Furthermore, where anaphylaxis was reported, additional information to support the diagnosis was obtained by reinvestigation. Our resurvey of dogs with anaphylaxis yielded responses on 31 dogs; 27 of these demonstrated collapse (87.1%), 24 demonstrated cyanosis (77.4%), and both signs occurred in 22 (71.0%). Higher rates of animal VAAEs, anaphylaxis, and death were found in Japan than in other countries. Further investigations, including survey studies, will be necessary to elucidate the interaction between death and vaccination and the risk factors for VAAEs, and thus develop safer vaccines. Moreover, it may also be necessary to continually update the data of VAAEs.",

According to large epidemiological studies on canine VAAEs, the incidences of anaphylaxis were 0.018/10,000 vaccinated dogs in the United Kingdom (Gaskell et al., 2002) and 0.65/10,000 vaccinated dogs in the United States (Moore et al., 2005) . Based on a survey of a small number (35) of Japanese veterinary hospitals, the anaphylaxis rate in Japan appeared to be somewhat higher, at 0.17% (6/3477 vaccinated dogs) (Fujimura, 2006) . However, to date, no large-scale investigation had been carried out on VAAEs associated with canine non-rabies combined vaccine in Japan. Moreover, although incidences of anaphylaxis were provided, none of the previous studies (Gaskell et al., 2002; Moore et al., 2005; Fujimura, 2006) considered important details, such as concurrent symptomatic states.",

Here, we present the results of a large-scale investigation of VAAEs at Japanese veterinary hospitals. We found a VAAE rate of 62.7/10,000 vaccinated dogs, which is much higher than the rates reported in the United Kingdom (0.093/10,000 vaccinated dogs) (Gaskell et al., 2002) and the United States (38.2/10,000 vaccinated dogs) (Moore et al., 2005) . Previous reports suggested that small breed dogs (<10 kg), especially Dachshunds, were more prone to VAAEs than larger dogs (Gaskell et al., 2002; Moore et al., 2005; Moore and Hogenesch, 2010) . According to the Japan Kennel Club (http://www.jkc.or.jp), Miniature Dachshund, Chihuahua, and Toy Poodle are the most popular breeds in this country, and account for just over half of the total registrations in the Club (50.3%).

Our previous study reported large amounts of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and bovine IgG contents in canine vaccines (Ohmori et al., 2005b) . Furthermore, we found IgE reactivity against fetal calf serum (FCS) components in dogs with allergic reactions after vaccination, suggesting that most of these reactions might be caused by FCS components derived from the culture media used to produce vaccines (Ohmori et al., 2005b (Ohmori et al., , 2007 . Many vaccines that are commonly used in Japan are imported from abroad, although a few are made in Japan.

In the present investigation, the incidence of anaphylaxis (7.2/10,000 vaccinated dogs) in dogs was remarkably higher than those reported in previous studies (Gaskell et al., 2002; Moore et al., 2005; Moore and Hogenesch, 2010) . The dogs showing anaphylaxis in the present study included many small breeds such as Miniature Dachshund and Miniature Schnauzer. This implies that a breed predisposition may play a key role in anaphylaxis after vaccination of dogs, just as in total VAAEs, and that genetic factors may be involved in these clinical signs. Moore et al. (2005) have indicated that the risk of VAAEs was significantly increased for small and neutered dogs, highest for dogs approximately 1-3 years old, and least for dogs \u22656 years of age. Unfortunately, as the information regarding dogs with no adverse events could not be obtained in the present study, the odds ratios of VAAEs could not be estimated; however, we did estimate the P values for anaphylaxis according to adverse reactions after vaccine administrations using a logistic regression model. Additionally, we were not able to analyze the relationship between breed and anaphylaxis due to small sample numbers for many breeds. However, no significant differences were observed in the anaphylaxis risk by sex and neuter status, weight, and age; thus, our data seem to show the same tendency of potential risk factors for VAAEs in the results of Moore et al. (2005) . The results of the present study suggest that various factors such as weight and age could predict the potential risk of adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis after vaccination, which may allow practicing veterinarians to allay the anxiety of at least a few owners regarding vaccination.",
