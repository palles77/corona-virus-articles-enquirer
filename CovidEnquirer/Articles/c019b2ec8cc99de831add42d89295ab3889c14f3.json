            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe acute alteration in pulmonary structure and function that is characterised by severe hypoxaemia, a fall in pulmonary compliance and residual pulmonary capacity 1 secondary to an inflammatory lesion of the alveolar---capillary membrane which causes an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability and therefore a diffuse pulmonary oedema. 2 ARDS affects more than one million patients in the world each year, 3 leading to a high rate of morbimortality in intensive care units. A fall in mortality has been observed recently, although there are studies in different healthcare systems which cite a mortality of 25%---31% 4 or even 58%. 5, 6 Apart from causing ARDS, the severe hypoxaemia which characterises the syndrome means that patients have to be ventilated mechanically to increase arterial oxygenation. Currently, as well as protective mechanical ventilation it is recommended that these patients be placed in the prone position (PP) as a coadjuvant to ventilation strategy, optimising the distribution of the ventilation-perfusion ratio. 7 In 1974 Bryan 8 described the technique of ventilating patients in the PP for the first time, showing an improvement in arterial oxygenation in patients with pneumonia and ARDS. Different studies were published after this showing an improvement in oxygenation but not that this postural treatment reduced mortality. 9---11 Recently, several studies undertaken in the sub-group of patients with severe hypoxaemia (PaFiO 2 : 150) have suggested the opposite, and the study by Gu\u00e9rin et al. 12 confirms the increase in survival of patients diagnosed severe ARDS who are placed in the PP at an early stage.",

The latter conclude that ARDS patients in the PP tolerate enteral nutrition and receive suitable nutrition. They also suggest the benefit of the prophylactic administration of prokinetic drugs. 26 On the other hand, some works show the incidence of intolerance to enteral nutrition in patients of this type amounts to 58.62%. 27 Other studies, such as the one by Reignier et al., 28 state that in cases of early enteral nutrition in patients in the PP more episodes of intolerance are detected, at 82% vs 49%.

Another aspect that should be taken into account in connection with the results obtained for DU would be the time spent in the PP. Currently there is no recommendation with a scientific basis for the time that a patient should spend in this position, although one recently published paper states that there is a tendency to increase the periods of time during which patients remain in the PP. 12 To conclude, and respecting the severe complications associated with the turning procedure, no accidents loss of the ETT, tracheostomy cannula, catheter (nasogastric or bladder), drainage and/or vascular access. This result is similar to those obtained in other studies, so that the PP may be said to be a safe procedure, as other publications on this postural treatment conclude. 9, 29 This study took place in an ICU with broad experience in the PP procedure.
