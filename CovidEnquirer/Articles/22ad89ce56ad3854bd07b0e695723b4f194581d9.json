There are many ways to classify lectins. Given the fact that a wide range of living organisms, from microbes to mammals, produce lectins, they can be divided according to species origin, such as microbial lectins, plant lectins, invertebrate lectins and vertebrate lectins. Based on the similarities in sequence of homology and activity, lectins can also be grouped into subfamilies. There are at least five groups of vertebrate lectins, such as C-type (calcium dependent), P-type, S-type, I-type, and pentraxins [1] . Cellular lectin molecules or receptors with lectin-like carbohydrate-binding domains play important roles in cell signaling, protein intracellular trafficking, and cell-cell communication [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

This type of classification is helpful for selection of lectins as structural probes in biomedical applications. By the early seventies, the carbohydrate-binding activity of a lectin was commonly described in terms of monosaccharide specificity. Experimentally, a type of inhibition assay, such as agglutination inhibition, was performed to identify the monosaccharide that most effectively inhibited the binding reaction. Many lectins are able to cross-react with a panel of sugar chains with a common terminal sugar residue. Lately, disaccharides are considered to be a better way to define a lectin's specificity.",

Aromatic amino acid residues appear frequently in carbohydrate-binding sites of various fine specificities. Such residues are large and participate in a wide variety of van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. The majority of crystal structures so far resolved are associated with a network of H-bonds, frequently with water molecules, in their combining sites. Such bound water molecules play important roles at the contacting interface between carbohydrate ligands and receptors. In addition, polyamphiphilic surfaces were identified in the interfaces of a number of carbohydrate ligands and binding sites. Presence of relatively rigid structures is required to produce an amphiphilic surface in solution. Carbohydrate molecules with branched termini, such as many blood group substances, which are formed by oligosaccharide chains, are favorable for the generation of such contact surfaces.",

(d) Representative carbohydrate chains of blood group glycoprotein from human ovarian cyst fluids. The four-branched internal structure (I-IV) shown is the representative internal portion of the carbohydrate moiety of blood group substances to which the residues responsible for A, B, H, Le a , and Le b activities are attached. This structure represents precursor blood group active glycoproteins [16] and can be prepared by Smith degradation of A, B, H active glycoproteins, purified from human ovarian cyst fluids. Numbers in parentheses indicate the site of attachment for the human blood group A, B, H, Le a , and Le b determinants. These determinants as well as the structural units at the non-reducing end are the sources of lectin A/A h , B/B h , I/II, T, and Tn determinants in (a) [9] .

Effect of polyvalencies of glyco-epitopes on the binding of a lectin from the edible mushroom, Agaricus bisporus [27] is another important example, in which the disaccharide II monomer and tri-antennary Gal 1-4GlcNAc (Tri-II) glycopeptides, the major carbohydrate side chains of Pneumococcus type 14 ps, asialo fetuin and asialo human 1 -acid glycoprotein, were poor inhibitors, while their polyvalent carriers were very active, implying that there are other more complicated structural factors involved in binding besides the multi-antennary II sequences.

Within each lectin family the overall profile and structure of the carbohydratebinding site(s) are conserved. A closer examination of the carbohydrate specificity further indicates that most plant lectins are not targeted against plant carbohydrates but preferentially bind foreign glycans [36, 37] . Establishing the relationship between the amino acid sequences of the combining sites of plant lectins and mammalian glyco-epitopes should be an important direction to be addressed in lectinology.",

It is suitable for displaying a diverse panel of carbohydrates in a limited amount of chip space. It is \"economical\" in using carbohydrates since each saccharide is spotted on a microarray substrate in an amount (approximately sub-nanograms) that is drastically smaller than that which is required for conventional molecular or immunological assays (approximately submicrograms or more). Its detection sensitivity is also higher than many conventional molecular and immunological assays [43, 45, 48] , which is an intrinsic property of the microarray-based miniaturized assays. Theoretically, the improved detection sensitivity can be attributed to the fact that the binding in a microarray assay meets the so-called \"ambient analyte condition\" [45] . A key factor for achieving this assay condition is the use of \"tiny\" amounts of carbohydrate ligand in microarrays. For the microarray platform we discuss here, only sub-nanogram amounts of carbohydrates are immobilized in the microarray substrate. Binding to these miniaturized carbohydrate spots has no or minimum reduction of the concentration of lectins in the solution phase. Under such conditions, the carbohydrate-lectin interactions reach equilibrium rapidly and result in highly sensitive detection of lectins or anti-carbohydrate antibodies.",

We present, here, an integrated strategy using these probes to facilitate the identification of immunogenic sugar moieties that are expressed by microbial pathogens. This involves three steps of experimental investigation. The first step is to perform carbohydrate microarray characterization of the antibody responses to an infectious agent or antigen preparation in order to recognize the disease-or pathogenassociated anti-carbohydrate antibody specificities. The second step focuses on identification of lectins and/or antibodies that are specific for the glyco-epitopes that are recognized by the pathogen-elicited antibodies. This provides specific structural probes to enable the third step of investigation, that is, to identify the glyco-epitopes in the candidate pathogens using specific lectins or antibodies identified by Steps 1 and 2. We applied this strategy to explore the glyco-epitopes expressed by a previously unrecognized viral pathogen, SARS-CoV [52] [53] [54] . Our rationale was that if SARS-CoV expressed antigenic carbohydrate structures, then immunizing animals using the whole virus-based vaccines would elicit antibodies specific for these structures. In addition, if SARS-CoV displayed a carbohydrate structure that mimics host cellular glycans, then vaccinated animals may develop antibodies with autoimmune reactivity to their corresponding cellular glycans.",
