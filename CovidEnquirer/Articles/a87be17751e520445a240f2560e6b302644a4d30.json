Tailoring this advice for an individual requires a thorough review of the travelers' itinerary and planned activities, consideration of the travelers' host characteristics, and a working knowledge of the epidemiology of relevant diseases. Travelers play an important role in the global epidemiology of infectious diseases; therefore ensuring that travelers are aware of specific preventive measures not only protects the health of the individual but has the potential to protect the health of their communities. In this chapter, pretravel considerations for major non-vaccine-preventable infectious diseases are covered, including specific advice for dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and avian influenza.",

With factors such as population growth, urbanization, globalization, travel, and climate change facilitating increased transmission, travel medicine practitioners in temperate countries are increasingly likely to see returned travelers with these infections. Furthermore, since the ranges of Aedes vectors extend into temperate areas, infected returned travelers can precipitate outbreaks of these viruses in nonendemic regions.",

A. albopictus feeds on animals as well as humans, prefers natural habitats, usually bites outdoors, and is generally considered a less efficient vector of human disease than A. aegypti. 1 Aedes mosquitoes can be found in temperate areas, including southern Europe (A. albopictus), northern Queensland in Australia (A. aegypti), and southeastern regions of the United States (both species) 2,3 ( Fig. 7.1 ).",

In addition to vaccinations and malaria chemoprophylaxis, a pretravel consultation should include advice on regionally endemic or emerging non-vaccine-preventable infections that can cause severe illness or chronic morbidity. These include mosquito-borne infections such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and regionally endemic severe respiratory infections such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and some strains of avian influenza. Zika virus is notable given its capacity for sexual transmission and association with congenital birth defects. Preventive advice for other potentially relevant infections associated with specific exposures or activities (e.g., schistosomiasis and leptospirosis from freshwater exposure) should be provided where relevant. Understanding the epidemiology and prevention of these infections is crucial to providing a comprehensive pretravel consultation. between nonhuman primates, small mammals, and Aedes mosquitoes. 14 However, in outbreaks CHIKV can spread without the need for animal reservoirs. 14 Among populations with no prior immunity, CHIKV outbreaks can be explosive, and attack rates as high as 70% have been documented. 15 Introduction of CHIKV into Asia occurred during or before the 1950s and led to outbreaks in India and Southeast Asia. 16 Reemergence of CHIKV from Africa in 2004 resulted in major outbreaks involving millions of people across the islands of the Indian Ocean in 2005 (including the Comoros Islands, La Reunion, and Mauritius) and India in 2005-2006. 16 Furthermore, introduction of CHIKV to temperate areas in this period resulted in autochthonous transmission in Italy and France. 17, 18 The first report of local transmission of CHIKV in the Americas occurred in 2013 in Saint Martin, with subsequent spread to >40 countries and territories across North, Central, and South America. 15 The unprecedented magnitude of CHIKV outbreaks in recent years is probably attributable to several factors including increased urbanization, global travel, and a series of adaptive mutations in the virus which have resulted in enhanced transmission by A. albopictus. 16 The incubation period of chikungunya is typically 2-4 days (range 1-14 days). 14 Most chikungunya infections are symptomatic, with more than 85% of people with serologic evidence of infection reporting a history of symptoms. 16 Chikungunya infection is characterized by sudden onset of fever and severe, potentially disabling arthralgia. Notably, the name chikungunya is derived from a Makonde word describing the bent posture that can be seen with severe arthralgia. 16 The arthralgia/ arthritis is usually symmetric and affects multiple joints, with fingers, wrists, ankles, elbows, toes, and knees the most often affected. 14 Additional symptoms include headache, myalgia, conjunctivitis, and rash. The case fatality rate of chikungunya is <1%, but disease can be associated with significant acute and long-term morbidity secondary to debilitating polyarthralgia/arthritis. 15 Although self-limiting in most individuals, some of those affected develop chronic joint pain that may last for months to years, with older people (>35-45 years) more predisposed. 14, 18 Unlike Dengue, in which nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated, antiinflammatory drugs are indicated for symptomatic management of chikungunya infections.",

Most infections are acquired in Asia, followed by the Americas, with only a small proportion acquired in Africa. 12 The incidence of dengue infection in travelers ranges from 10.2-30 infections per 1000 person months, and varies according to travel destination, duration, and season of travel. 11 Regionspecific peaks of travel-related dengue infections have been demonstrated for Southeast Asia (June and September), South Central Asia (October), and South America (March). 13 Viraemic travelers can introduce dengue into new areas, with autochthonous transmission documented in the continental United States, Europe, and Australia. 11, 12 Some travelers with dengue may require hospitalization or even evacuation. 10 Studies of dengue in travelers have reported a dengue hemorrhagic fever prevalence of 0.9%-3%, though this is likely an overestimate as patients experiencing more severe symptoms are more likely to seek medical attention. 11 Epidemiologic studies in endemic settings have shown that the risk of severe disease is significantly higher during a second DENV infection than during a primary infection. 5 However, a lack of consensus exists regarding risk factors for severe disease in travelers. 11 Results of one study in travelers suggest that severe dengue may occur at similar rates among cases with primary and secondary infections. 9 Given that most dengue infections are asymptomatic, and that severe dengue in travelers is rare, travelers with a history of dengue infection need not avoid known dengue areas but rather should be advised to use the personal protection strategies outlined in Box 7.1 to prevent subsequent infection.",

An association with GBS was first reported in 2013-2014 during the French Polynesian outbreak. More than 20 countries have now reported an increased incidence of GBS and/or laboratory confirmation of a ZIKV infection among GBS cases. 23 In February 2016, following reports from Brazil of microcephaly in babies whose mothers had been exposed to Zika during pregnancy, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that Zika constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). 19 Microcephaly is one of several neurologic and musculoskeletal birth defects described in congenital infection; this constellation of findings is now known as congenital Zika syndrome. 27",

First described in 2012, 31 MERS is an endemic infection in the Arabian Peninsula with epidemic potential in health care and travel settings. Following an incubation period of 2-14 days, initial symptoms of MERS are similar to many common viral respiratory infections and include fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and muscle aches. Rapid progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome may follow, but mild and asymptomatic infections have also been described. 32, 33 Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, and acute kidney injury can also occur. 32 Risk factors for severe MERS include age >50 years and comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, end stage renal disease, chronic lung disease, cancer, or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. 32 Among confirmed cases reported to WHO up to July 2017, 35% have been fatal. 33a Seroepidemiologic studies indicate that MERS-CoV circulates in dromedary camels in the Middle East and Africa, and direct contact with camels has been described in 33% of primary cases without known exposure to MERS cases or health care settings. 34 The route of transmission from dromedaries to humans is unclear, but contact with infectious bodily secretions and fluids are suspect, and consumption of raw dromedary products has also raised some concern. 32 Person-to-person transmission is primarily described in health care settings, although transmission among household close contacts has been described. 35 All cases of MERS reported outside of the Arabian Peninsula have occurred in returned travelers, or as a result of secondary transmission from a patient with recent travel to the Arabian Peninsula, as was the case for the 2015 health care-associated outbreak in South Korea that resulted in 186 cases and 36 deaths. 32, 36, 37 In this outbreak, delayed MERS diagnoses and inadequate infection control precautions led to multiple generations of infections affecting other patients, visitors, and health care workers. 37, 38 The risk of traveler-initiated health care-associated outbreaks with MERS mirrors the global experience of SARS. Like MERS, the viral agent of SARS is a coronavirus that emerged in southern China in 2002 and subsequently caused over 8000 infections and 774 deaths in more than 20 countries. 38, 39 The reservoir of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is unknown, but some cases appear to have resulted from contact with animals used for human consumption such as civet cats. 40 Although no cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, the potential for reemergence is possible. 39",
