At 2e14 dpi, TCoV antigens were detected in the paranasal sinus and lachrymal accessory gland (Harderian gland) of infected chicks and in the ileum, ileocaecal junction and caecum of infected poults. Lymphocytic inflammation was present in these tissues. TCoV was re-isolated from pooled tissue suspensions of nasal concha, Harderian gland and paranasal sinus from chicks, as well as from the ileum, ileocaecal junction and caecum of poults, after three consecutive passages in 28-day-old embryonated turkey eggs. Viral RNA corresponding to the spike gene region (1178e2073 genome position) was amplified from the upper respiratory tract of chickens and from the intestinal tract of poults and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the identity as TCoV. This is the first description of TCoV antigens and mRNA in upper respiratory tissues in experimentally infected chickens.",

Positive controls consisted of tissue sections from TCoV-infected poults in which the infection had been confirmed by RT-PCR amplification. Negative controls consisted of tissues collected from uninoculated poults, for which infection status had been confirmed to be negative.

IHC and RT-PCR were used for detection of viral antigens and genomes, respectively. Of the tissues examined, only the upper respiratory tract of chicks and the alimentary tract of poults were consistently positive for the presence of TCoV. The pattern of virus spread and replication observed among the TCoV isolates in turkeys is different from that reported previously (Dea et al., 1991; Heggens et al., 1998; Ismail et al., 2001 Ismail et al., , 2003 . It has been reported that PEMS causes alterations in the cells of the immune system, including down-regulation of macrophage function and a reduction in expression of lymphocyte subpopulations in the thymus and spleen (Heggens et al., 1998) . However, in the present study there were no remarkable histological changes in the BF, thymus or spleen after infection, which is in accordance with a previous report (Teixeira et al., 2007) . Moreover, in a retrospective review of previous work, the propagation of TCoV in turkey and chicken embryos via the amniotic route was documented and it was suggested that TCoV is not pathogenic to chickens; however, replication of the virus in the gut of chickens raises a question about the potential role of chickens as carriers of the virus (Adams and Hofstad, 1971; Ismail et al., 2003) . The possibility of TCoV replication in cells other than those of the intestinal epithelium was not addressed by these previous studies.",

The concentration of plasma cells in the Harderian gland has been considered higher than in other avian organs (Payne, 1994) . In the present study, the combination of IHC and RT-PCR demonstrated TCoV antigens and viral RNA in the Harderian gland of infected chicks. This observation supports the idea that TCoV has the ability to replicate at a low level, confirmed by virus re-isolation and subsequent sequencing of the partial spike gene; however, no clinical signs of a respiratory disorder were documented. Furthermore, no phylogenetic differences were observed between TCoV isolated in Brazil and the closely related American isolates (Breslin et al., 1999a,b; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008) . Although the avian intestinal tract is anatomically complete early in embryonic development and at hatch, the poult digestive system is still immature, which renders it vulnerable to various infectious and non-infectious agents that commonly bombard the digestive tract during brooding (Brown et al., 1997) . As reported previously, TCoV alone does not damage the integrity of the intestines (Guy, 2003) . Other organisms may contribute to the appearance and severity of clinical signs initiated, at least in experimental trials, by TCoV infections (Ismail et al., 2003) . This was observed in the present study by infecting poults with TCoV isolated in Brazil, with mild microscopical lesions being documented in the ileum, ileocaecal junction and caecum. Finally, this study contains the first description of TCoV detected in the upper respiratory tract of experimentally infected chicks. Fig. 3 .
