It is mainly associated with exposure to cigarette smoke. In addition, it is considered, at present, a serious public health problem, ranking fourth in mortality worldwide. Many cells participate in the pathophysiology of COPD, the most important are neutrophils, macrophages and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Neutrophil migration to the inflammation area could be mediated largely by cytokines related to CD4+ Th17 lymphocytes, because it has been shown that IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 act as inducers for CXCL8, CXCL1, CXCL5, G-CSF, and GM-CSF secretion by epithelial cells of the airways. The aims of these molecules are differentiation, proliferation and recruitment of neutrophils. Furthermore, it is believed that CD4+ lymphocytes Th17 may be involved in protection against pathogens for which Th1 and Th2 are not prepared to fight. In COPD exacerbations, there is an increased cellularity in the lung region and respiratory tract. Therefore, the increase in the number of neutrophils and macrophages in the airways and the increase in proinflammatory cytokines are directly related to the severity of exacerbations and that is the importance of the functions of Th17 profile in this entity.",

These data lead to the belief that this disease is due to multiple factors that interact with each other. Among the most prominent are genetic factors that can condition patients to have a certain susceptibility to COPD. For example, deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT) (responsible for inhibiting proteases, whose function is to deplete the extracellular matrix) is present in at least 1% of the carriers of the disease in Europe and the United States and other regions around the world such as Africa and Australia. 3 Many cells participate in the pathophysiology of COPD, the most important are neutrophils, macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and the chemical mediators they produce (cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, growth factors, etc.). For example, neutrophil elastase (NE) is an enzyme that degrades the extracellular matrix to facilitate the migration of the neutrophil through the lung parenchyma to the inflammation area. People harboring AAT deficiency alleles have a greater susceptibility to presenting the disease or presenting it at an earlier age. 1, 4 On the other hand, cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, CXCL8 (also called IL-8), IL-22, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-17F and TGF-\u03b2 among others are increased in samples from patients with COPD, suggesting an important role in its pathophysiology and in the exacerbations that may occur due Epidemiology COPD is now considered a serious public health problem, reaching the fourth place in mortality worldwide and in Mexico as well. 6, 7 Globally, this disease is present in ~600 million of people, especially in low-and middle-income countries. It is estimated that in 2020, it will rank among the first three causes of death worldwide. 8 COPD and asthma are the airway obstructive pathologies more prevalent. 9",

            "text": "The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) defines COPD as a common and treatable disease characterized by the persistent limitation of airflow, which is usually progressive and associated with an increase in the inflammatory response in the airways and in the lungs by harmful particles and gases. 10 Also, this guide defines exacerbations as an acute event characterized by worsening of patient's respiratory symptoms that go beyond daily variations and leads to a change in medication. 6, 10, 48 In addition, the guide also points out that a patient with frequent exacerbating COPD will be considered when he has two or more exacerbations per year, where the best predictor will be the history of previous treatments for exacerbations. 10 Indeed, about half of COPD patients die after 4 years of their first episode of exacerbation. 11 The symptomatology of COPD is diverse, depending on the phenotype (emphysema and chronic bronchitis, the most common). However, there is a range of signs and symptoms that occur more frequently, such as dyspnea of small efforts, chronic cough and increased sputum production. In addition, other clinical data that may appear are hypoxemia, hypercapnia, the so-called \"chest in barrel\" (which appears due to lack of elasticity in the lungs and does not retract properly), weight loss, etc. 6, 10, 48 Molecular mechanisms in COPD Innate immunity COPD is characterized by a chronic inflammatory process caused by tobacco smoke, harmful particles or gases that are capable of activating the cascade of inflammatory reactions that cause tissue destruction in the airways. 5 Pathological changes that are induced as a consequence of chronic exposure to cigarette smoke are observed more early in airway epithelium, which acts as a barrier that protects the lungs from environmental factors and also from .4,000 toxic compounds present in tobacco smoke. 12 Toxic particles contained in the cigarette smoke generate tissue remodeling ( Figure 1 ) as a consequence of the damage they cause to airway epithelium. 13 The most pronounced changes are shortening of the cilia (resulting in less mobility Figure 1 When airway epithelium is exposed to harmful substances, such as those contained in cigarette smoke, it changes its structure. Note: These changes include the loss of close junctions between ciliated epithelial cells, shortening of cilia, hyperplasia of goblet-producing goblet cells and basal cells, in addition to squamous epithelial cell metaplasia.

For example, a microenvironment rich in IL-12 will lead to the activation and differentiation of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. 22 It has recently been proposed that COPD may be an entity of autoimmune etiology, because autoantibodies have been found against peptides present in the extracellular matrix of lung tissue. Among them, the most important is elastin (anti-elastin antibodies are then formed). These autoantigens would be responsible, in large part, for mediating and perpetuating the inflammatory response present in the disease. 2 In this context, B lymphocytes present in the peribronchial lymph nodes will be of special importance. Once sensitized by CD4+ T lymphocytes, they will be able to synthesize and secrete antibodies (which may be directed against host peptides). 5",

Its differentiation from naive T lymphocytes occurs from three signals: first, the binding of the TCR to the antigen; second, the action of costimulators (for example, B7 binding to CD28 present on the lymphocyte membrane); third, the environment of cytokines that exist in the medium, for example, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-21, IL-23 and TGF-\u03b2. 24 In this way, naive T lymphocyte is polarized to Th17 lymphocyte from transcription factors characteristic of that cell line, such as ROR\u03b3T, STAT-3 and STAT-5. 25, 26 Once polarization of the naive T lymphocyte occurs in Th17 lymphocyte, it synthesizes IL-21 to generate an autocrine stimulation and, thus, to activate the transcription factor ROR\u03b3T for the synthesis of new cytokines, especially of the IL-17 family. 27 In addition, IL-23 in combination with TGF-\u03b2 also induces the activation of ROR\u03b3T and subsequent expression of IL-17A. However, they can only do so after IL-6 or IL-21 has facilitated the expression of their receptors. 28, 29 It has also been proposed that, in addition to participating in the recruitment of leukocytes (mainly neutrophils), IL-17A influences most cells in the lung parenchyma, such as macrophages and DCs, which express receptors for ",

Of these, the most frequent are those of infectious origin, with bacteria and viruses being the most prevalent etiological agents, with 50%-70% and 30%, respectively. 37 The clinical manifestations present during exacerbations are a consequence of the action of the virus/bacteria and of the immune response against the pathogen that assembles the host. 38 Bacteria Previously, the lungs were believed to be a sterile area, free of microorganisms. 39 However, recent studies have shown that this is not entirely true and that the lungs contain, depending on the disease or stage in which they are found, a variable content of microbiomas. 40 In the upper airways, there are also colonizing microorganisms; nose, for example, is colonized by bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Corynebacteria. 41 The nasopharynx is colonized under normal conditions by non-hemolytic, \u03b1-hemolytic Streptococcus and some Neisseria species, in addition to S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. 42 The presence of bacteria in patients who have had an exacerbation does not prove that these alone are sufficient to trigger the exacerbation of the symptomatology of patients with COPD, because they can also be isolated in individuals who do not have this pathology. 39 In healthy individuals, different species of bacteria are constantly inhaled. However, due of the responsiveness of their immune system that is not compromised, they are not capable of infecting the host. This response is generated mainly by the presence of antimicrobial molecules present in the respiratory mucosa such as defensins, pentraxin-3, lactoferrin, lysozyme and cathelicidin, as well as immunoglobulin A (IgA) and tissue resident cells. 39 An important factor associated with the predisposition of COPD patients to present exacerbations is the metaplasia of squamous epithelial cells that appears as a consequence of the damage generated to the airway epithelium by the chemical compounds of the cigarette.

Among them, ICAM-1 overexpression stands out, where, for example, rhinoviruses are anchored and more easily enter epithelial cells, favoring infection. 41 It has been described in several studies that the functionality of NK lymphocytes in patients with COPD is severely diminished, which leads to a greater propensity for virus infections (rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, etc.), causal agents of a high percentage of exacerbations in this type of patients. The low antiviral activity is due, in large part, to the inhibition of the secretion of cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12, in addition to the low production of enzymes such as perforins, so they cannot eliminate the cells already infected by virus, so that the infection continues its course without having a response that attenuates it. 56 It has been proposed that vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25D] ) plays a key role on lung immunity. During a viral infection, vitamin D induces I\u03baB\u03b1 (a potent inhibitor of NF-\u03baB) expression in airway epithelial cells, favoring a reduction of proinflammatory cytokines and no change in viral clearance. 57 This increase of 1,25D in airways will contribute to control tissue damage, while maintaining viral clearance. In COPD, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent and correlates with severity of COPD. 58 An important mechanism through which 1,25D can predispose to present an exacerbation is by suppressing Th1 (IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1) and Th17 (IL-17A, IL-17F) cytokines and promoting regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) (IL-10, TGF-\u03b2) function. 59 Lower levels of 1,25D in COPD may be explained by different mechanisms, for example, the reduction of cutaneous vitamin D3 production caused by smoking and limited sunlight exposure. Other mechanisms of vitamin D deficiency could be reduced vitamin D activation in liver and kidneys, increased vitamin D sequestration in adipose tissue and decreased intestinal absorption. 60 As with pneumococcus, it is recommended that COPD patients be immunized annually with the influenza vaccine, since it is also one of the main etiological agents of exacerbations. In addition, several studies suggest that epidemiologically speaking, influenza vaccine is more effective than pneumococcus. 42",

This cytokine is particularly central to lung immunity because it has been demonstrated that innate host defenses to respiratory pathogens are compromised in mice lacking this proinflammatory cytokine or its receptor (IL-17RA), leading to reduced neutrophil activation, differentiation and recruitment and increased bacterial proliferation. 61 Le Rouzic et al 62 in their study showed that chronic exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) inhibits S. pneumoniaeinduced monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) maturation and secretion of cytokines involved in Th1 and Th17 T cell differentiation, among which are IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 (which is necessary to Th17 polarization).

These data suggest that CD17+ Th17 lymphocytes play an important role in the immune response to bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and M. catharralis. 56 DCs are professional APCs whose principal function is linking the innate and adaptive immune responses, a central mechanism in COPD. A chronic exposure to CSE has been related to a deficiency in the phagolysosome trafficking in DC, secondary to low expression of maturation markers such as CD83, which leads to a deficient antigenic presentation and, consequently, an inadequate response against bacteria such as S. pneumoniae. 62 van der Sluijs et al 64 reported in their study that inhibiting the production of IL-10 (inhibitory cytokine) by Tregs decreases the likelihood of secondary S. pneumoniae infection.",

When this happens, the signaling pathway led by NF-\u03baB and IRF3 culminates in the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines, in addition to type I IFNs, such as IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, creating an antiviral state that rests the infection. With the production of these IFNs, inhibition of the response of this strain of cooperating T lymphocytes, such as Th17 CD4+, is generated, causing greater susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, thus aggravating the health status of patients with COPD susceptible to this type of infections. 56 Since cytokines such as IL-17A and IL-17F do not exist in the airway microenvironment, the production of neutrophil chemoattractants by airway epithelial cells such as CXCL8 and CXCL5 cannot be induced and the action required attracting neutrophils, and therefore, there is not adequate containment of extracellular bacteria. 34 Another way that has been recently described as an important mediator of Th17 CD4+ inducers is a serum amyloid A (SAA), which promotes expression of inflammatory mediators and neutrophil chemotaxis and survival by the ALX-FPR2 receptor. SAA is also a potent endogenous ligand that stimulates expression of Th17 polarizing mediators and influences in vitro Th17 differentiation of CD4+ T cells. 61",
