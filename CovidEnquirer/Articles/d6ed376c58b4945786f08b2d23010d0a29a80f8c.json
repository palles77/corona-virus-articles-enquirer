In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the C protein was generated with the recombinant C protein expressed in Escherichia coli as immunogen. IFA and IPMA analysis showed that the native C protein of CSFV virions was reactive to the mAb. By truncating the C protein, we identified a linear epitope recognized by the mAb, corresponding to amino acids 61 TQDGLYHNKN 70 of the CSFV C protein, which is well conserved among pestiviruses. Laser confocal analysis showed that the C protein mainly locates in the cellular nucleoplasm and nucleolus of PK-15 cells. The results have implications for further study of CSFV replication.",

The disease causes significant economic loss worldwide and is one of the Office International des Epizooties listed notifiable diseases (Paton and Greiser-Wilke, 2003) . CSFV is a small, enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which is classified in the genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae, along with bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, and border disease virus (BDV) (Becher et al., 2003) . The 12.5-kb CSFV genome contains a single open reading frame that encodes a 3898-amino-acid polyprotein and yields 12 final cleavage products: NH2-N pro -C-E rns -E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4ANS4B-NS5A-NS5B-COOH through co-and post-translational processing of the polyprotein by cellular and viral proteases (Meyers et al., 1989; Meyers and Thiel, 1996; Thiel et al., 1991) . The virion consists of four structural proteins, the capsid (C) protein and the glycoproteins E rns , E1, and E2 (Thiel et al., 1991) .",

The C protein is a small protein and rich in basic amino acids (lysine and arginine) (Meyers et al., 1989; Thiel et al., 1991) . Mature C protein has 86 amino acids and its apparent molecular weight (MW) is 14 kDa (Heimann et al., 2006) . The N terminus ( 169 Ser) of the C protein is cleaved by autocatalysis of the N pro protein (Rumenapf et al., 1998; Stark et al., 1993) . The C protein is followed by the E rns protein, of which N terminus ( 268 Asp) is generated by the signal peptidase (SP) (Heimann et al., 2006; Stark et al., 1993) . The C protein acts as a transcriptional regulator and plays an important role in the CSFV virion maturation (Liu et al., 1998a) . Formation of a C protein-RNA complex inside the virion suggests a protective function of the C protein (Meyers and Thiel, 1996; Thiel et al., 1991) . Furthermore, C proteins may function in RNA structural rearrangements taking place during virus replication (Ivanyi-Nagy et al., 2008) and RNA packaging and virion morphogenesis (Murray et al., 2008) . To our knowledge, other potential functions of the C protein remain unknown.",

In this study, we generated the mAb 3E8 recognizing the native CSFV C protein, using the recombinant protein His-C expressed in E. coli as immunogens. Consequently, the mAb 3E8 provides a tool to analyze the function of the C protein in CSFV infection. Then, using the truncated C proteins, an epitope recognized by the mAb 3E8 corresponding to aa 61-70 (TQDGLYHNKN) on the CSFV C protein was identified (Fig. 4) . To our knowledge, this epitope is the first one identified on the C protein of pestiviruses. Fine mapping of the epitope needs to be done to determine the minimum motif and the contribution of each residue.",

In this study, using the recombinant expression vector pEGFP-C1-99, the distribution of the C protein was investigated. We demonstrated that the C protein localized in the cytoplasm and nucleolus of transfected PK-15 cells (Fig. 6) . This subcellular distribution of the C protein of CSFV is reasonable, for that as a structural protein inside the virion, the major population of the C protein should reside in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, in order to carry out the transcriptional regulation, the C protein may enter into the nucleus including the nucleolus, just as the localization of the nucleoprotein of avian coronavirus and bovine herpesvirus-1 infected cell protein 27 (BICP27) (Chen et al., 2002; Guo et al., 2009) . Meanwhile, we detected the nucleolar localization of the C protein of CSFV using 3E8 in CSFV-infected PK-15 cells. However, no nucleolar localization of the C protein was observed in CSFV-infected cells. Possible explanations may be that success-ful detection of nucleolar proteins using antibodies can be related to the concentration of the protein within the nucleolus and the nucleolus is not always refractive to antibody staining (Sheval et al., 2005) . In addition, charged proteins can also migrate through cells post-fixation and become localized to the nucleus Johansson, 2001, 2002) . In a previous report, no nucleolar localization of SARS-CoV N protein was observed using anti-N antibody in infected cells (You et al., 2005) .",

Then the transport of larger proteins through the pore is an active process requiring ATP, and such proteins contain a NLS (Nigg et al., 1991; Richardson et al., 1988) . The C protein of CSFV meets both criteria in that the C protein is less than 40 kDa in size and is predicated to contain a NLS (PESRKKL).
