Durham, appearing 5 years after the fi rst edition, has added several important diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian infl uenza, and monkeypox. The authors also have updated the chapters included in the fi rst edition. At nearly 600 pages, the book gives a broad overview of 22 emerging diseases with mention of many others. Topics such as antimicrobial drug resistance, bioterrorism, and travel-associated issues also are covered. Persons interested in having a bedside companion about microbes out there in the world waiting to infect humans will enjoy this book, and medical personnel should fi nd it useful. Many chapters begin with a clinical case history, which captures the reader's attention and transports him or her into the mindset of a clinician. Yet the book by no means can serve as a diagnostic manual. Rather, it provides basic information on diseases and issues that should be kept in mind in diagnostics, such as behavioral, cultural, and environmental factors that infl uence the likelihood of infection with particular pathogens.",

To avoid inaccuracies, the submitted manuscript would have benefi ted from review by scientists with current ex-pertise regarding specifi c pathogens. For instance, it is stated that West Nile virus-infected horses maintain \"moderate to high levels of virus,\" whereas recent research indicates low transient viremia in equines that cannot infect mosquitoes (1). In addition, some statements may be misleading, such as \"high levels of the [West Nile] virus in birds may persist for long periods of time (20-100 days); thus, migratory birds are implicated in the introduction of WNV.\" Recent studies indicate that high levels of viral RNA but low levels of infectious virus have been recovered from birds up to 6 weeks after infection (2, 3) . The epidemiologic signifi cance of these fi ndings is not clear.",

Broad, sweeping statements are made, which by their nature are inaccurate, such as the statement in the introduction that Ebola \"came and disappeared.\" If only that were so! Also, some important emerging/reemerging diseases are not covered in detail, such as chikungunya, or at all, such as Japanese encephalitis. More problems occur with the glossary, which, for example, defi nes an arthropod as a \"vector belonging to the phylum Arthropoda that transmits an organism from 1 host to another.\" This is more a defi nition of an \"arthropod vector\" since not all arthropods are vectors. Therefore, scientists, especially those involved in public health, may not fi nd their particular areas of expertise described satisfactorily, but they will fi nd in many areas outside their immediate fi eld of knowledge a useful compact description that addresses the highlights of a particular disease.",

Appendix D provides information on available resources for learning more about specifi c diseases, appendixes A and B list and describe emerging/reemerging infectious diseases by organism and by modes of transmission, and appendix C lists measures to prevent these diseases. Overall, we recommend this book to anyone who wants an introduction to the public health aspects of emerging diseases. ",
