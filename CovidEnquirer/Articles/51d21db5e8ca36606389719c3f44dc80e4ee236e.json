A zoonotic disease may be a virus, parasite, fungus, or bacteria. Most viruses transferred in this way are manifested by a mild respiratory infection similar to the common cold. However, occasionally a zoonosis or zoonotic disease can be fatal or even cause a pandemic.",

More recently, swine flu and avian (bird) flu have been characterized as zoonotic conditions (Richard, DeGraaf, & Herfst, 2014) . Ebola virus is hypothesized to have originated among bats or nonhuman primates (CDC, 2019).",
