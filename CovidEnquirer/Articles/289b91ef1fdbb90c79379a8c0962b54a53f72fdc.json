The recently identified RV-C seems to be associated with asthma exacerbations and more severe disease, but results vary. We studied the prevalence and severity of infection with RV in an unselected birth cohort. Children with respiratory symptoms entered the symptomatic arm of the cohort and were compared with asymptomatic children. Severity of wheezing and other respiratory symptoms was registered. Respiratory viruses were evaluated using throat and nasopharyngeal swabs on first presentation and after recovery (wheezing children). RV genotyping was performed on RV-PCR positive samples. RV was the most prevalent respiratory virus and was found in 58/140 symptomatic children (41%), 24/96 (25%) control children and 19/74 (26%) wheezing symptomatic children after recovery (p <0.05) and did not differ between wheezing and non-wheezing symptomatic childrendrespectively, 42% (38/90) and 40% (20/50). RV-A was the most commonly detected species (40/68, 59%), followed by RV-C (22/68, 32%) and RV-B (6/68, 9%). RV-B was more frequently detected in asymptomatic children (5/6, p <0.05). There was no significant difference in the frequency of RV species between wheezing and non-wheezing symptomatic children. Children with RV mono-infection had more severe symptoms, but no association between RV species and severity of disease was seen. In an unselected birth cohort from the Netherlands with mild respiratory disease RV was the most prevalent respiratory virus. RV(-C) infection was not associated with more severe disease or wheezing.

Participating parents were instructed and reminded throughout the study period to contact the study team whenever their infant experienced respiratory tract symptoms from November 2009 until December 2012. The presence of symptoms was assessed using a standardized telephone interview. Infants experiencing cough, wheezing, laboured breathing and/or dyspnoea sufficiently severe for parents to warrant a visit to their general practitioner entered the symptomatic arm of the study and were visited by the study team within 8 hours after establishing these symptoms. If parents refrained from contacting the study team or contacted the study team after visiting the general practitioner and obtaining medical treatment, these children were not included. During the visit, the presence and severity of acute respiratory symptoms were assessed by both parents and the on-site researcher. The researchers were well trained to recognize wheezing. The intra-class correlation was validated by means of evaluation of tracheal sound recordings by five paediatric pulmonologists in the first 30 patients, which reached a Crohnbachs a of 0.75. The study team assessed symptom severity (physician symptom score) by scoring the presence of suprasternal retractions, scalene muscle contraction, air entry and wheezing by auscultation, all part of the Paediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure [15] . Values of the physician symptom score range from 0 to 10 with increasing values indicating increased severity. Parents selfassessed the severity by Asthma Control Questionnaire [15] modified for by-proxy use, although it has not been validated for this application. If wheezing could not be confirmed during the first visit, children were revisited and re-assessed when symptoms recurred. For each child only one symptomatic visit was included in the study.",
