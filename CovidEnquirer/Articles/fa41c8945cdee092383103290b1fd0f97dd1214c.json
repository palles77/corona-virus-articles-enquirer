ACE2 catalyses the conversion of angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7) [14] and to a lesser extent Ang I to Ang-(1-9) [15, 16] which is converted to Ang-(1-7) by ACE [17] . Ang-(1-7) has a number of important actions that oppose those of Ang II including vasodilatation [18, 19] and inhibition of cell proliferation and tissue fibrosis [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] , an effect that appears to be mediated through the Ang-(1-7) receptor Mas [21, 25, 26] . Ang-(1-7) is converted to the inactive peptide fragment Ang- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) by the action of ACE, and use of ACE inhibitors has been shown to increase Ang-(1-7) levels in tissue and plasma [27, 28] .",

            "text": "Our studies provided a number of lines of evidence to suggest that the diseased liver itself contributed significantly to the increased production of Ang-(1-7) following BDL. ACE2 activity (expressed per mg of tissue) was not increased in other sites of ACE2 expression, including lung, kidney and intestine, whilst it was increased more than 4-fold in the liver, so that when the mass of individual organ is taken into account, following BDL the liver was the organ of greatest ACE2 activity. We have shown previously that ACE2 is proteolytically cleaved from membrane by metalloproteases to release a soluble form with catalytic activity [40, 41] . Thus, in the present study, the diseased liver was the likely source of the major increase in plasma ACE2 activity. In situ perfused rat liver experiments confirmed that following administration of Ang II, greater amounts of Ang-(1-7) were produced by diseased livers than controls. Importantly, the increase in hepatic ACE2 expression in BDL livers was accompanied by upregulation of ACE expression and activity. The finding that Ang-(1-7) release from BDL, but not sham livers, was greatly increased by ACE inhibition indicates that this high level of hepatic ACE activity facilitated the breakdown of Ang-(1-7), reducing Ang-(1-7) release (Fig. 1) . This confirmed that BDL livers have a much greater capacity to metabolize exogenously administered Ang II into Ang-(1-7), but that much of this Ang-(1-7) is subsequently broken down by ACE. These findings are in keeping with the concept that the net tissue production of Ang-(1-7)/Ang II is determined by the relative activity of ACE2 and ACE [19] . Whilst the primary purpose of these studies was to examine the effects of liver injury on the novel ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis of the RAS, we also documented for the first time the progressive changes that occur in ACE and Ang II levels as fibrosis develops in this model. The current studies demonstrated bi-model changes in plasma Ang II levels during the course of the experiment with an initial marked rise at week one followed by a fall in levels at weeks 2 and 3 and then a significant rise at week 4. These changes are likely to reflect a balance between influences of multiple factors including an acute response to the initial liver injury following BDL surgery, increases in hepatic and serum ACE activity, Ang II degradation by hepatic and serum ACE2 and activation of the systemic RAS in response to the development of portal hypertension and vasodilatation [7, 42] .",

            "text": "Recently, the G protein-coupled receptor Mas has been reported as being the principal functional receptor for Ang-(1-7) [25, 26] . However, there is limited understanding of the factors controlling Mas expression and its relationship to ACE2. In the present study, we showed that the transcription of Mas gene in the liver was very closely linked to ACE2 gene expression. This provides support for the concept of the development of an hepatic ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis as liver fibrosis progresses in which increased Mas is available to transduce Ang-(1-7) signal [26] . Furthermore, Ang-(1-7) has been shown to be a vasodilator in a number of vascular beds [6, [43] [44] [45] and thus it might be expected to reduce intrahepatic tone in cirrhotic livers; an effect that might help counterbalance vasoconstriction mediated by locally generated vasoactive hormones such as endothelin 1 and Ang II. However, despite marked upregulation of Mas receptor expression, the present data showed that Ang-(1-7) does not elicit an intrahepatic vasodilator response in perfused BDL rat livers. Thus it appears that whilst the breakdown of locally produced Ang II by ACE2 may help protect the cirrhotic liver from Ang II mediated vasoconstriction and tissue injury, there is no detectable direct effect of Ang-(1-7) on sinusoidal resistance, possibly reflecting the known general impairment of NO dependent vasodilatation in the cirrhotic liver [46] . In contrast BDL livers were hyper-responsive to Ang II compared to those from healthy rats suggesting that our in situ perfusion model is appropriate to measure pressure changes in response to angiotensin peptides. This latter finding is also of interest given that the relative importance of Ang II as mediator of increased portal resistance has been questioned [47] based on a study of hepatic hemodynamics in isolated perfused cirrhotic rat livers which suggested that Ang II mediated vasoconstriction is attenuated in the cirrhotic liver [48] .",

The changes in ACE2 expression were confined to the liver indicating that they represent a local response to liver injury and/or upregulation of the ACE-AT1 receptor axis of the RAS. These findings raise the possibility that upregulation of hepatic ACE2 and Mas, and the generation of Ang-(1-7) represent a counter-regulatory response to RAS-mediated liver injury. Whether, as in other organs [19, 29] , manipulating this axis may affect tissue injury in chronic liver disease remains to be determined.",

In situ perfused rat liver and angiotensin-(1-7) production in response to angiotensin II (Ang II) bolus injection by bile duct ligated (BDL) rat liver (closed circles) and control rat liver (open circles). Livers were perfused with oxygenated Krebs Henseleit solution (1% BSA) for 25 min, two outflow effluent samples were collected and Ang II bolus injection (60 pmol) was given, followed by sample collection for 75 s (a). The same livers were perfused again with Krebs for 5 min, and then with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril (10 \u00c06 mol/L) throughout sample collection (b). Baseline corrected total area under the angiotensin-(1-7) curve for BDL livers (filled bars) and control livers (open bars) with or without ACE inhibitor is shown in panel (c). Each circle/bar represents the mean \u00b1 SEM concentration from 4 to 5 rats per treatment group. *** P < 0.001, ** P < 0.01, * P < 0.05, a P = 0.05, baseline-corrected BDL vs. control.",

Panel (a) depicts the change in portal resistance in in situ perfused livers from rats 4-weeks after bile duct ligation (BDL) (filled bars, n = 4) or age-matched controls (open bars, n = 6) in response to varying bolus doses of angiotensin-(1-7). The responsiveness of the liver to angiotensin-(1-7) was confirmed at the end of each experiment by the administration of a bolus dose of phenylephrine (PE). Panel (b) depicts the percentage of relaxation of pre-constricted control livers (n = 5) in response to a vehicle administration (closed circle) followed by varying bolus doses of angiotensin-(1-7) (open circles). Panel (c) depicts the vascular response of sham (open bar, n = 5) and BDL (filled bar, n = 6) livers in response to a bolus dose (10 \u00c08 M/L) of angiotensin II.
