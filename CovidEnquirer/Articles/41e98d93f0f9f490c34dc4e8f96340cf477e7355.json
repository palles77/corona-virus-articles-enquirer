Leukocyte counts are variable according to stage; frequently low during the early stages of illness, and later become normal or slightly elevated (15) . In the present series, there were no patients with elevated WBC counts and 67% of patients showed lymphocytopenia. These findings are consistent with those found in previous studies that dealt with unspecified populations (3, 5) . One additional diagnostic laboratory feature we were able to find was an elevated CRP level while both the ESR and WBC counts remained within a normal range in all patients in our study with pandemic Korean J Radiol 11(4), Jul/Aug 2010 - (14) . Further detailed comparative studies with a larger number of patients would be required to fully explore this issue. Most patients in our study did not show a severe hospital course, although one patient's symptoms aggravated into ARDS and needed mechanical ventilation before laboratory tests revealed that he had the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection. We considered the possibility that co-infection of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus with other unknown respiratory pathogens under the leukocytopenia status could have attributed to this symptom aggravation (9, 10), particularly as he was a soldier serving in a different unit from the majority of other patients. In addition, the symptom aggravation had occurred after he had been in contact with a patient infected with the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus and there were no pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus cases in the unit the patient had been enrolled in. However, since his respiratory symptoms and high fever did not respond to other previous antibiotic treatment, there is still the possibility that the disease course in this case could have been solely due to a severe manifestation of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection.",

This suggests that negative findings on chest radiographs cannot rule out the possibility of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection, particularly in its early stage or for an uncomplicated influenza infection (14) . Thin-section CT examination results revealed that abnormal findings were found in six out of 12 patients (50%). The most common CT abnormalities included small GGOs in five out of six patients and nodules in all six patients. However, in the previous studies (12, 13) , multifocal consolidations (two of seven patients and 50%) and GGOs (two of seven patients and 25%) were the most common CT findings of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection. The differences between the present study and previous studies could be attributed to the fact that radiological examinations in the present study were performed at the initial presentation, and probably the early stages of the disease; whereas in previous studies (12, 13) , radiological examinations were performed at various times after symptom onset.",

We attribute this to the patient population of our study. All of our patients were healthy young soldiers without any risk factors for complications. Furthermore, according to military rule, any problems concerning health must be notified to the medical department immediately, and thus, our patients may have been detected at an earlier stage of the disease course than would be found for the general population. In comparison with a previous report (3) that showed a high mortality rate in patients with the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection, the interval between symptom onset and the emergency department visit (mean 1.7 days in 15 among 18 patients) and symptom onset and the start of antiviral agent therapy (mean 3.9 days) were shorter. In addition, detection and treatment were made more promptly. Therefore, we conclude that an early diagnosis and early antiviral management can improve the clinical course and outcome of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection. However, to understand the detailed relationship between symptom onset to admission or antiviral management and clinical courses or outcomes, further study, including a comparative analysis with a large case series, is warranted.",

Clinical and laboratory results from this homogeneous study population can be helpful in understanding the clinical characteristics of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection in semi-closed settings and in institutionalized populations composed of a young healthy population, such as in schools, dormitories, prisons, or military units.
