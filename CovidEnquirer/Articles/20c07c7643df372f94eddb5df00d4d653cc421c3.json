This model system was used to investigate delivery of the internal structural proteins of PVM as a potential vaccination strategy to protect against pneumovirus disease. Replicationdeficient recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vectors were constructed that expressed the M or N gene of PVM pathogenic strain J3666. Intranasal delivery of these rAd5 vectors gave protection against a lethal challenge dose of PVM in three different mouse strains, and protection lasted for at least 20 weeks post-immunisation. Whilst the PVM-specific antibody response in such animals was weak and inconsistent, rAd5N primed a strong PVM-specific CD8 + T cell response and, to a lesser extent, a CD4 + T cell response. These findings suggest that T-cell responses may be more important than serum IgG in the observed protection induced by rAd5N.",

Subsequently, many HRSV vaccine strategies have been investigated [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , however no clinically successful candidate has emerged. HRSV vaccine candidates are often investigated in mice, although very high challenge doses are required to give disease and even then, pathogenesis does not match that seen in severely affected human infants [15] . In contrast, low doses of PVM in its natural rodent host give clinical signs ranging from upper respiratory tract infection to fatal pneumonia [16] with pathogenesis that closely resembles severe HRSV disease in humans, making it an appropriate system for investigating pneumovirus pathogenesis and immune responses [17, 18] .",

            "text": "HRSV vaccine strategies have focused on stimulating a strong systemic humoral response against the F and G glycoproteins [11, 19] . However, the natural response that resolves pneumovirus infection is primarily mediated through CD8 + T-cells [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) have been widely developed as vaccine candidates, including to deliver HRSV glycoproteins [13, 19, 25, 26] , and typically elicit potent T H 1-biased responses [27] . We therefore evaluated intranasal (i.n.) delivery of human rAd type 5 (rAd5) PVM recombinants in the mouse as a model for protection against pneumoviruses. We selected this route since it was superior to intramuscular (i.m) delivery in providing protection against either lethal influenza A virus challenge or HRSV replication in the lung [13, 28] ; it is also now an established route for human vaccination [29] . We focused on the internal proteins M http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015. 10 .105 0264-410X/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. and N since they contain potent cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) epitopes in HRSV [30, 31] and H-2D b and H-2K b restricted CD8 + T cell epitopes in PVM [32, 33] . Furthermore, vaccinating calves with N protein vectors primed BRSV-specific T cells and conferred partial protection against BRSV challenge [34, 35] and mucosal immunisation of mice with HRSV N protein nanoparticles induced both specific antibody and T cell responses, and reduced HRSV pulmonary replication [36] . We show here that rAd5 containing the M or N gene of PVM is able to elicit long-term protection against lethal PVM infection in mice, correlating with the stimulation of PVM-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations.",

Such responses vary in outbred populations because epitopes must be presented by highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. We therefore tested whether protection in BALB/c mice (MHC haplotype H2 d ) could be replicated in other mouse strains. C57BL/6 (H2 b ) and C3H/He-mg (H2 k ) mice, immunised with 10 7 pfu rAd in a two-dose regime, were fully protected from PVM by rAd5N immunisation, as were C57BL/6 animals by rAd5M; in each case animals remained healthy following challenge (data not shown). rAd5M only partially protected C3H/He-mg animals with two of five succumbing during the challenge period, although one of these occurred without prior elevation in clinical score and so may not have been due to the challenge (data not shown). Thus, protection against lethal PVM infection by rAd PVM recombinants extends to multiple MHC haplotypes.",

Older animals are slightly less susceptible to PVM-induced disease [42] and this was reflected in the survival of some PBS mock-immunised animals. However, these control animals showed significantly greater weight loss and clinical scores than immunised animals following PVM challenge at any time-point. rAd5N or rAd5M protected against lethal PVM challenge up to 20 weeks post-immunisation ( Fig. 3A and B) . Whilst rAd5M-immunised animals showed some weight loss, particularly following prolonged delay between immunisation and challenge, this was transient and less severe than in rAd5Z-immunised mice, which showed severe disease similar to the mock-immunised animals (Fig. 3C) . Thus, immunisation with 10 7 pfu rAd5M or rAd5N can elicit long-lasting, antigen-specific protection in mice against severe or lethal PVM disease.",

Protection from lethal PVM challenge by rAd5M and rAd5N is long lasting. Mice were immunised i.n. at 0 and 14 days with 10 7 pfu doses of rAd5N (A), rAd5M (B) or rAd5Z (C) or mock-immunised with PBS, and groups of six immunised animals plus two mock-immunised animals were challenged with a lethal dose of PVM at each time point. Following challenge, mice were weighed (left panels) and assessed for clinical signs of PVM disease (right panels) daily. The graphs for PBS mock-immunised animals were generated by taking an average of the data from the mice challenged at the various time points. Dotted lines: mean weights or scores after the loss of one or more animals from the group. A single experiment was conducted because of the numbers of animals involved. Other details as for Fig. 1. weeks 8, 11, 14 and 20. Although some rAd5M-immunised animals possessed anti-PVM IgG at weeks 6, 8 and 11 (Fig. 5A) , at no time point did any more than a minority show a response. For rAd5N, only one animal developed detectable anti-PVM IgG by week 6 but the numbers responding and magnitude of response increased in weeks 8 and 11 (Fig. 5B) ; again, only a minority showed a detectable response at any time point and anti-PVM IgG antibodies were no longer detectable by week 20. As expected, rAd5Z elicited no detectable anti-PVM IgG at any time (Fig. 5C) . In contrast, all animals mounted a detectable anti-Ad5 response, confirming delivery of the immunogen (Fig. 5D-F) . The absence of consistent anti-PVM antibody responses in the context of consistent protection from lethal PVM challenge suggested that an anti-PVM IgG response was not the primary mechanism of protection.",

Notably, anti-PVM IgG had declined to undetectable levels by 20 weeks post immunisation yet all animals were still protected. Specific protection was not explained by priming for a rapid PVM-specific antibody response as there was no difference in specific IgG titres between rAd5N-immunised and control vector or rAd5Z-immunised animals post-challenge (data not shown). PVM-specific antibody responses might be weak because PVM M and N proteins do not contain strong B-cell epitopes or because the route of administration could not elicit such responses. The latter is unlikely since rAd5 expressing HRSV antigens elicited good serum IgG responses when delivered by the i.n. route [13, 26] and our immunisations reliably elicited Ad5-specific IgG. We also considered whether our protocol might have elicited greater mucosal than serum antibody responses, however we did not detect any PVM-specific IgA in BAL fluid obtained from vaccinated mice. Therefore, whilst it remains possible that rAd5N and rAd5M each elicited some form of antibody that our assays could not detect and which was the basis of protection, we consider this unlikely.",

PVM-specific T cells are known to protect against challenge [23] and we propose that this cellular response is a major factor mediating specific protection in our study. Since rAd5N elicited protection against PVM challenge in three different mouse strains, this suggests that PVM N contains T-cell epitopes that are recognised in multiple MHC backgrounds. Previous studies with rAd HRSV vaccine candidates have included vectors expressing the F protein [25, 26, 44, 45] , G protein elements [13] or F, N and M2-1 proteins [46] which elicited strong anti-HRSV serum antibody and potent T-cell responses in mice. In contrast to PVM rAd5 studied here, vaccination with a chimpanzee rAd (PanAd3) expressing F, N and M2-1 caused accelerated onset of weight loss in mice following HRSV challenge, a difference most likely due to the high titre HRSV challenge inoculum encountering a strong CD8 + response induced by M2-1 [46] . However, whilst these studies demonstrate that various rAds and dosing regimens can inhibit HRSV replication in mouse lungs, the failure of even high-dose HRSV challenge of mice to fully replicate the pathogenesis of RSV infection in humans means the implications of these studies for protection of humans against HRSV disease are not clear. Whilst 10 7 pfu rAd5N and rAd5M clearly elicited antigenspecific protection against PVM, significant non-specific protection against PVM disease was seen with a 10-fold higher dose rAd5Z, albeit less effective than equivalent doses of rAd5N or rAd5M. A similar finding of non-specific protection was reported previously in ferrets immunised with high dose rAd: though having no effect on SARS coronavirus replication in the nose, control rAd reduced virus penetration into the lung and consequent pathology [47] . Many other studies of rAd immunisation have not included both empty rAd and non-immunised controls so any non-specific protection would not have been detected. In one further study that incorporated both controls, non-specific protection in the airway was not seen after rAd delivery to mice i.m. [48] ; this difference from our findings likely reflects the distinct immunisation and challenge target tissues preventing any non-specific local responses to the immunogen being protective. Further investigation is needed to understand the nature and scope of non-specific protection against respiratory infection following high-dose intranasal rAd delivery.",

However pre-existing circulating Ad5 antibody did not prevent a response to mucosally delivered rAd5-Ebola antigen that was sufficient to protect mice against lethal Ebolavirus challenge [50] so pre-existing antibody to rAd5 is not an absolute barrier to effective use. Alternatively, vectors based on either human Ad types of lower sero-prevalence, non-human Ads [45] or chimeric Ad5 vectors having substitutions in key antigenic regions [51] may be used, although these alternative Ad types may not share the strong immunogenicity of Ad5 [52] .",

Protection can be generated with a single dose, and a twodose regime provides long-term protection. As PVM pathogenesis in rodents is similar to HRSV infection in humans, our findings of successful protection against disease in this model suggest that a similar strategy could be applied to protect against HRSV disease in humans.",
