Many other rodents such as the chinchilla (Chinchilla laniger), dormice (Glis glis), jerboa (Jacuills orientalis hibernator), degu (Octogon degll) , and duprasi (Pachyuromys duprasi) have been finding their way into homes as pets as well. Rat and mouse shows and organizations like the Rat and Mouse Club of America (http:// www.rmca.org) and the American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (http:// www.arfma.org) are manifestations of the increased popularity and social standing of the rodent pet. Rodent owners want a higher standard of care for their rodent friends, which includes visits to the veterinarian. The exotic animal veterinarian can expect to expand his or her practice to meet the needs of these rodent patients.",

            "text": "Diagnostic clinical pathology has not been viewed as practical for the rodent patient. In the past, clinical pathology has not contributed greatly to diagnostic medicine for the individual laboratory rodent. Cultivation of the technical skills necessary to take advantage of laboratory tests has the potential to improve the standard of veterinary care that exotic animal practitioners can provide. The small size of laboratory rodents makes obtaining useful samples difficult, but ultramicroanalytical techniques have become available for processing microliter samples. Currently, for a typical blood chemistry test, 20 to 50 J.LL of serum or plasma are required. Commercial diagnostic laboratories with expertise in rodent diseases are available as resources. Implantation of chronic catheters, vascular access devices, or other special means such as vacuum blood collection devices and other blood collection techniques, have been refined by the biomedical research community.\"' \" 43 These ideas are available for adaption into clinical practice by those who are willing to develop the skills to utilize them. An overview of rodent sample collection techniques, hematology, clinical biochemistry, serology, and clinical pathology of other tissues and fluids for laboratory rodents is provided in this article. Many principles of clinical pathology can be applied across species, and the intent here is not to review these concepts but to point out the subtleties of the different rodent species that may affect diagnostic interpretation.",

            "text": "Blood collection in the rodent requires micro techniques and special materials (Fig. 1) . Microcollection tubes such as Microtainer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or the Microvette (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) are available untreated for serum collection or with an anticoagulant such as heparin or ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) for plasma collections. Microhematocrit tubes or other blood capillary collection devices such as the Safe-T-Fil (RamScientific, Needham, MA) or the Becton Dickinson Capillary Collectors can collect 16 to 200 j.LL samples; however, there may be some unwanted hemolysis, even if the tubes are treated with heparin or EDTA. Most tests can be run on plasma as well as serum. If volume is critical, consider plasma because the yield of plasma is greater than serum for a given sample. have advantages in that more options of microcollection tubes are available with heparin, cellular morphology is preserved longer in a heparinized sample, and liquid EDTA-containing tubes may artificially dilute small samples as well as cause crenation of the red blood.\" Potassium values may be artificially high and calcium may be low when EDTA is used. Consider using collection tubes with the gel separator. They improve the plasma or serum volume recovery from a blood sample. Proper handling of the samples once they are obtained and until they reach the laboratory for processing is essential. Take the time to separate the serum or plasma from the cellular components. Glucose, potassium, and phosphorus are not stable in whole blood. Again, the gel separator tubes make this convenient. Depending on the collection tube, the sample can be stored separated by the gel in the tube for 2 to 3 days without decanting into another sample tube. Using the largest-bore collection device possible reduces the vacuum or draw on the vessel and helps minimize hemolysis. The blood volume of most rodents is very small. Major blood loss may have significant biological effect. How much blood is safe to draw? How often can you draw it? McGuill and Rowan25 published a very thorough discussion in Biological Effects of Blood Loss: Implications for Sampling Volumes and Techniques. Interpretation of the information in this paper led to limits on blood collection volumes. In the United Kingdom, the Joint Working Group on Refinement report Removal of Blood from Laboratory Mammals and Birds, suggested that generally as much as 10% of the circulating blood volume can be taken from a healthy animal at one time with minimal adverse effects.23 This may be repeated after 3 to 4 weeks. This recommendation appears conservative in light of more recent publications. Scipioni et aP2 found that collection of 40% of a rat's total blood volume over a 24-hour period could be repeated in 2 weeks without gross ill effects. Another rat study showed 0.9 mL could be withdrawn weekly without causing any detectable changes in hematologic parameters?4 Approximately 50/,) of body weight can be sampled from midgestation in rats without having a gross negative effect on the pUpS.2f> Practically speaking, collection of 2% of body weight can be tolerated in healthy animals, but a mild anemia should be expected. 2s \u2022 32 Table 1 furnishes typical body weights (BW), blood volumes (BV), and calculated blood collection volumes based on BW and BV for the common rodents. Although a collection volume based on BV is the most accurate method, the following rule of thumb is acceptable and simple: a maximum collection of 1 % of BW in a 2-week period.",

The rodent head should be stabilized at the base of the skull and at the point of the jaw. Thumb depression on the jugular vein may assist in collection by distending the plexus. The index finger should retract the dorsal lid of the eye. A slight exophthalmos facilitates the approach under the globe. The collection-site approach and the collection device depend on the rodent. For mice and gerbils, a microcapillary tube or small-bore Pasteur pipette is gen tly inserted at the medial canthus (Fig. 2) . With gentle pressure, the clinician advances the tube by either rocking or rotating the tube until the conjunctiva is punctured and the orbital venou s sinus plexus is penetrated. Slightly withdrawing the tube after firs t entry into the plexus may increase blood flow. The blood fills the tube by capillary action. When the tube is removed, apply pressure over the eye. Be careful not to traumatize the contralateral eye; 0.5 mL may be collected from a healthy adult mouse in this manner. The approach for retro-orbital bleeding varies amongst rodent species because of differences in the orbital venous. In the hamster approach, the tube should be inserted midway along the superior border of the eye and advanced to the plexus located posterior to the globe (Fig. 3) .\" In the rat, the venous plexus lies deep in the orbit. Although it is possible to use the lateral or the medial canthus approach, the medial canthus is largely occupied by the Harderian gland and has only small veins and not a plexus. The middorsal approach, as illustrated in Figure 3 , is the most direct approach to the dorsal anastomotic vein in the rat. 36 Application of ophthalmic ointment after retro-orbital bleeds is not suggested and may be harmful because of overgrooming by the rodent.",

Hemolysis or hemorrhage may result in a loss of RBC numbers and a low packed cell volume (PCV) , Regenera- tion of RBCs may result in an increased reticulocyte count or basophilic stippling. However, in rodents, especially the gerbils, the short RBC life span leads to a high percentage of RBC basophilic stippling and a high reticulocyte count. Newborn gerbils have as much as 40% basophilic stippling, whereas newborn rats have 12% to 15% basophilic stippling. Rats have 16'}' o reticulocytes at birth; this decreases to 2.5\u00b0/', reticulocytes as adults. Hamsters have 10% to 30% nucleate RBC, whereas the adult hamster has less than 2'Yc). ' 5 In general, hemoglobin and hematocrit values are lower in the newborn rodent (mouse, rat, guinea pig, gerbil) than in the adult animal. This is different than in most mammals, including the human. Gender-associated differences have been reported for RBC counts in the rat, the chinchilla, and the gerbiP, 15, 21 This is not the case for the guinea pig.\" In general, the female has a higher count than the male, but this is a strain variability in the mouse or rat,?, 15,21 There are great variations in mouse hemoglobins that represent genetic differences as we1U, 21 Variations occur because of the sample collection site or the effects of anesthesia. As an example, the hemoglobin and rcv is greater in a sample taken from the rat's tail than in a sample taken from either the abdominal aorta or the heart. RBC values may be changed owing to RBC sequestration in the spleen during anesthesia, as is suggested in the guinea pig,21 Nonpathogenic conditions that influence RBC parameters include pregnancy, seasonal changes, and hibernation. In the rat, the PVC decreases during pregnancy. IS In the hamster, RBC counts, hemoglobin concentration, and rcv are elevated during hibernation. The hamster basal metabolic rate decreases, and the RBC life span increases during hibernation. 2 1 RBC morphology differentiates the origin of the anemia-hemorrhage, hemolysis, iron deficiency, nonregenerative anemia, bone marrow disorders, or lymphoproliferative diseases (leukemias). Rodent RBC features must be kept in mind when changes in cellular morphology are interpreted. The rodent RBC averages 6 to 7 fLm in size and ranges from 6.0 fLm in the hamster to 7.S fLm in the guinea pig. Rat RBCs are large at birth (10.03 fLm) but decrease in the first 30 days of life, Mouse RBC size increases with age. There are great variations in mouse RBC morphology. These polymorphisms represent genetic variations. 2 \", . 10 Polychromasia is a constant feature of the rodent hemogram. 21 3 () The significant RBC rouleaux formation is seen in the guinea pig blood smear. 21 A diagnosis of hemolytic anemia would indicate a search of the blood smear for evidence of blood parasites. RBC parasites such as Eperythrozoon cocco ides and Hemobartenella muris are of concern in the mouse and rat. I e Diagnosis of chronic blood loss as suggested by microcytosis, hypochromasia, low total protein, thrombocytosis, and an elevated reticulocyte count would suggest checking for a parasite load. This is common in guinea pigs and rats with heavy lice infestations. 16",
