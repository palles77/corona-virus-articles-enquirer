Subsequent studies have shown that hypertrophy of fat cells can contribute to this mechanism, resulting in an increase in intraosseous or intracortical pressure and, thus, compromising the endosteal arterial supply. In humans, the hyperlipidemia induced by corticosteroids causes increased deposition of fat within the intramedullary tissue (by steroid-induced differentiation of osteogenic marrow cells into adipocytes), thereby causing elevation of intracortical pressure, which can lead to restriction of blood flow, ischemia, and sinusoidal collapse. Given the inelastic, nonexpandable cortical shell of bone, increased intraosseous pressure can result in \"compartment syndrome\" and subsequent disruption of blood flow. Compression of the sinusoidal system leads to venous stasis and eventually to arterial obstruction and subsequent bone injury.",

A meta-analysis of hip ON conducted by Mont et al (28) suggested that asymptomatic ON has a high prevalence of progression to symptomatic disease and subsequent femoral head collapse. The high morbidity rate associated with hip ON most often leads to the eventual need for total hip arthroplasty, despite conservative treatment. However, treatment is currently determined by the end-stage changes of the bone rather than on the pathogenesis and disease prevention (29) . Conservative medical management is the first line of treatment and historically involves rest/activity modification, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory agents (30) , all of which have provided relatively poor results. The largest numbers of published studies have investigated the use of bisphosphonates, which have been shown to be effective in numerous animal models. Their proposed mode of action is inhibition of osteoclast activity, which reduces edema and the rate of remodeling in the femoral head, which then increases bone mineral density and, hence, delays the progression of bone collapse (31) . Iloprost, a vasoactive compound, acts on the terminal vascular bed by inducing vasodilation, reducing capillary permeability, and inhibiting platelet aggregation and has been shown to be effective in treating ON of the femur and the foot (29) . Low-molecular-weight heparin products have also been used in patients with ON caused by thrombophilia or hypofibrinolysis (31) .",

Statins have also been shown to have pro-osteoblastic and anti-adipogenic effects on bone marrow stromal cells by increasing bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression and reducing adipocyte-specific gene expression (3, 31) . Chang et al (3) found that lovastatin stimulated osteogenesis and reversed the steroid suppressive effect in bone marrow stromal cells in non-ON cases but had only a mild effect in ON cases. Pritchett et al (8) retrospectively reviewed the data from 284 patients who had received high-dose steroids and were also taking statin therapy. They noted a 1% rate of ON, a significantly lower rate than the generally reported 3% to 20% rate of ON for patients receiving high-dose steroids. However, no studies to date have been reported on the use of statins in patients with established/pre-existing ON. Other conservative treatments include hyperbaric oxygen therapy, shock wave therapy, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, and physical therapy (31) (32) (33) .",

The reported operative treatments for atraumatic ON of the ankle have included core decompression, vascularized and nonvascularized bone grafting, tibiotalar fusion, and talectomy with tibiocalcaneal fusion (37, 38) . Core decompression has historically been used during the early stages of ON of the ankle as a treatment method to decrease pain and defer the eventual collapse of the joint (38) . The multiple locations of the lesions, including the distal tibia and fibula, talar dome, and calcaneus, and the relatively small affected bones (compared with the femoral head and distal femur), make this procedure technically difficult, especially considering that large-diameter trocars were initially the instruments used. Marulanda et al (38) investigated the treatment of ankle ON with a new technique using multiple small percutaneous 3-mm perforations in a total of 44 ankles. At a mean follow-up duration of 45 months, 40 ankles (91%) had achieved a successful clinical outcome and a statistically significant improvement of the mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society ankle and hindfoot scale score, which increased from 42 points preoperatively to 88 points postoperatively (38) . No perioperative complications developed, although 3 ankles subsequently collapsed and required arthrodesis. However, ankle arthrodesis was avoided in 93% of the cases at a mean follow-up period of 3.6 years.",

However, it is difficult to determine with any certainty whether tibial ON and talar osteochondritis dissecans were isolated events or linked pathologically.
