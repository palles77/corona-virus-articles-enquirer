We hypothesized that structural changes of the lung might correlate with symptoms and pulmonary function. To answer this question, we correlate findings of high-resolution CT (HRCT) with dyspnea scores and results of pulmonary function tests in patients during recovery from SARS. Design: Retrospective follow-up cohort study. Setting: University hospital. Patients: Nineteen patients who recovered from SARS-related hospitalization. Measurements: The study included HRCT scores (0 to 100), dyspnea scores (1 to 4), static and dynamic lung volumes, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Results: The interval between hospital discharge and HRCT study or functional assessment was 31.2 \u060e 4.8 days (range, 25 to 38 days) [mean \u060e SD]. All patients had HRCT abnormalities and were assigned to two groups: ground-glass opacity (GGO) only (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 7, 36.8%) and GGO with fibrosis (GGO\u0609F) [n \u202b\u060d\u202c 12, 63.2%]. Most patients (16 of 19, 84.2%) had no zonal predominance. HRCT scores correlated well with dyspnea scores (r \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.78, p < 0.01) and with a variety of pulmonary functional variables, with DLCO being the most significant (r \u202b\u060d\u202c \u060a 0.923, p < 0.001). Compared with the GGO group, the GGO\u0609F group showed significantly lower FEV 1 , FVC, total lung capacity, residual volume, and DLCO. Conclusions: HRCT findings correlate well with functional studies and clinical symptoms during recovery from SARS. Longer-term follow-up studies in a larger cohort of patients should be performed to investigate the clinical outcome of recovered SARS patients. (CHEST 2004; 126:149-158)",

[12] [13] [14] Among them, a recent report by Antonio et al 12 described that fibrosis was present in 62% of their symptomatic patients with SARS after discharge, and suggested that fibrosis was more likely to develop in patients with more severe disease. However, the extent of disease evaluated by CT and its relationship to functional studies and symptoms in patients during recovery from SARS have not yet been reported. It is therefore important to have a more comprehensive insight into possible clinical outcome of patients with SARS during the recovery period to enable identification of patients who are not recovering at the expected rate.",

All patients were scanned in the supine position, with additional scans obtained in the prone position to avoid physiologic-dependent areas of attenuation in the posterior lung.

The score represented the percentage of lung parenchyma that showed evidence of abnormalities, mainly areas of GGO and fibrosis, estimated to the nearest 10% of parenchymal involvement. The overall percentage of involvement was obtained by averaging the six lung zones by each individual observer. Reproducibility or intraobserver variability of HRCT scoring was determined by correlating readings at the same images twice by two individual observers not aware of any clinical information. Final scores were determined by an average of scores assessed by two observers with a difference within 5%. Readings were repeated when the difference of scores between two observers exceeded 5% until a consensus was reached.",

We treated 68 patients at our institution during the Taiwan epidemic, 52 of whom were discharged and are now followed up at our hospital.

To date, investigation of functional changes that might correlate with structural changes depicted by CT, focusing on those who experience persistent respiratory symptoms during recovery from SARS, has not been reported. We performed a retrospective study correlating pulmonary function and clinical symptoms in a cohort of SARS patients after discharge to develop a more comprehensive insight into their clinical outcomes during the early recovery phase.",

Both of these studies have the same limitation as to investigate structural changes of the lung by HRCT only for symptomatic patients of SARS during recovery. It would be interesting to compare symptomatic patients with asymptomatic patients to see whether symptomatic patients have more severe HRCT abnormalities than those of asymptomatic patients. In our study, major findings on HRCT were bilateral patchy areas of GGO with or without fibrosis. These findings were in general agreement with those of Antonio and colleagues. 12 Similar to their finding of fibrosis in 62% of patients, we identified fibrosis in more than half of our patients (12 of 19 patients, 63% ). It is difficult to know how many of these structural changes will resolve by time. In patients with evidence of fibrosis at HRCT, the importance of concomitant presence of ground-glass opacification is not clear. Presumably, areas of ground-glass opacification may represent either residual inflammation that may resolve or may evolve to fibrosis over time. To address this speculation, a longer term of follow-up may be needed. It is believed that pulmonary fibrosis observed at the recovery phase would at least in part account for the respiratory symptoms. Compared with CT findings as a predominant lower lobe and peripheral distribution during the acute phase of SARS reported by Wong et al, 11 we and Antonio et al 12 observed generally no predominance in distribution of pa-renchymal abnormalities. This difference in patterns of CT abnormalities suggests either that structural changes related to SARS evolve over time, or that the underlying pathophysiologic process may resolve at varying rates.",

CT findings of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia are well characterized, [27] [28] [29] and are similar to those of SARS. 11 Taken together, results from previous pathologic and image studies, we speculate that a possible small airway dysfunction reflected by our pulmonary function study may be attributed to a possible presence of small airway obstruction within the area of GGO. In addition, GGO\u03e9F may reflect a repair process accompanying the parenchymal inflammation at varying phases of SARS, or may be a more extensive form of SARS-related lung injury reflected by a more pronounced functional impairment, as we have demonstrated.",

A recent report by Ho et al 30 showed that PS therapy appeared to be a more efficacious and equally safe steroid regimen as compared with low-dose NPS in the acute stage of SARS. In contrast, we and Antonio et al 12 em-ployed a standard treatment protocol for SARS for adults recommended by So et al. 20 All of our patients were treated with methylprednisolone in addition to the use of ribavirin and broad-spectrum antibiotics as diagnosis of SARS was confirmed. Unlike study reported by Ho et al, 30 who divided their regimens of corticosteroid therapy into PS and NPS at the beginning of treatment for SARS, we administered PS only if the clinical condition worsened with deteriorating chest radiographic findings and decreasing oxygenation saturation. In our study, patients who had more pronounced HRCT abnormalities or worse PFTs results were virtually treated with PS because of a rapid deterioration of their clinical condition. It is therefore difficult to determine whether PS therapy was more efficacious than NPS based on our results. A prospective randomized trial and longterm follow-up of structural and functional changes of the lung is needed to determine whether PS is indeed superior to NPS in treating patients with SARS.",

ARDS reflects the most severe form of SARS, which leads to a mortality rate of 48%, similar to that of ARDS in patients with other types of pneumonia, and in patients with SARS who required critical care. 31 Notably, the medical response to SARS-related ARDS extends well beyond intensive care for ARDS caused by other etiology, as it involves an overwhelming public health issue. 32 Viral pneumonia usually resolves without any clinical or radiologic sequelae, 33 whereas SARS-related respiratory sequelae appeared to be quite common among its survivors as observed by us and others. 12, 14 Intriguingly, follow-up CT scans of ARDS survivors other than SARS tend to be limited in extent, and usually show a predominance in ventral distribution of fibrosis and parenchymal opacification, 34, 35 whereas pulmonary abnormalities of SARS-related ARDS appear random in their distribution and are usually extensive. A restrictive type of functional impairment and decreased Dlco in ARDS survivors has been described by previous reports. 36, 37 However, Neff and colleagues 38 reported recently that residual combined restrictive and obstructive type of functional impairment remained common in survivors of severe ARDS treated in surgical intensive unit. In general, lung volume and spirometric measurements returned to normal in most of the patients over time, 37 but Dlco remained low in long-term follow-up. 36 -38 These results suggest that persistent decrease in Dlco reflects a permanent parenchymal damage of the lung as fibrosis in ARDS patients. Similarly, our evaluation on SARS-related functional changes in early recovery phase showed a restrictive defect and significantly decreased Dlco. It would be interesting to compare structural and functional changes in survivors of SARS-related ARDS during late recovery with those of ARDS survivors not related to SARS by a similar follow-up protocol.",

In this study, we demonstrated that HRCT analysis correlated well with functional studies and clinical symptoms with the most significant correlation with Dlco. In addition, all patients in our study showed restrictive functional impairment. Our results suggest a potential role of HRCT and pulmonary function testing to track respiratory sequelae related with SARS. Longer-duration follow-up studies in a larger cohort of patients should be performed to investigate the long-term clinical outcome of patients recovering from SARS.",
