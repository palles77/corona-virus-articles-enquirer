The law was intended to establish standards and control the importation of products into the United States as well as the domestic distribution of products, assuring the purity, safety, potency, and efficacy of veterinary biological products. Prelicensing data evaluation procedures are designed to assess the quality of each product and support product label claims. Under the standard licensing process, this spectrum of evaluation includes complete characterization of seed material and ingredients, and laboratory-and host-animal safety and efficacy studies. Post-license testing includes batch tests for purity, safety, and potency. As part of the production and testing of regulated products, procedures involving animals are used to validate product requirements for safety, potency, and efficacy. Incorporating alternative methods to reduce, refine, and replace the use of animals in the development and testing of veterinary biological products has been a strategic goal for the CVB for several decades, and current licensing processes and policies are designed to support and encourage the shift from animal-based methods to alternative practices while ensuring that regulated products continue to be safe and effective.",

            "text": "A historical review of regulatory requirements and guidelines provides evidence of the changes that have been put in place in recent decades to promote animal use alternatives and application of 3Rs principles in veterinary biological products. Many of the standard requirements found in the 9 CFR were first established when animalbased tests were the norm. Regulations were first published in 1969 [4] to allow for in vitro quantification of live viral products in lieu of animal testing. These regulations, along with the introduction and application of the Master Seed Lot concept initiated the shift from host-animal to laboratory-animal testing paradigms and led to the development of many of the current 9 CFR Standard requirements. In 1984, regulations were issued for serial release of bacterial and other products [5] . The CVB continues to promote the evolution from animal-based tests to alternative in vitro laboratory-based methodologies for assessing relative serial potency. Table 1 provides a brief history of the types of regulations and guidance documents that have been put in place to advance this shift. Of note are CVB Notices 07-02 and 07-12, which outline recent advances in validating methods for qualification of Leptospirae products for dogs. [6] . Regulations and guidance documents have also been published to provide provisions for the use of humane endpoints [7, 8] , which has had a significant impact on the animals used in the testing of veterinary biological products.

Applying and converting licensing standards for products that were licensed before the advent of new technologies requires a large investment in both time and resources to ensure that correlation to protection is still demonstrated. Application of in vitro methods to quantify potency often requires identifying specific protective antigens, which in many cases is unknown or not possible. Validating new techniques and technologies often requires considerable effort to ensure that the new potency test is a true correlate to protection. Considering the vast array of veterinary biological products that are currently licensed for hundreds of different animal diseases, it is apparent that considerable effort will be required to move this initiative along for the entire spectrum of available products.",
