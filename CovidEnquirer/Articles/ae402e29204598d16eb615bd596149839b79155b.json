            "text": "Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) is a piscine orthomyxovirus causing a serious disease in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) is responsible for both viral attachment and release. Similarity to bovine and porcine torovirus hemagglutinin-esterase (BToV HE, PToV HE), bovine coronavirus HE (BCoV HE) and influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (InfC HEF) proteins were exploited in a computational homology-based structure analysis of ISAV HE. The analysis resolved structural aspects of the protein and identified important features of relevance to ISAV HE activity. By recombinant expression and purification of secretory HE (recHE) proteins, receptorbinding and quantitative analyses of enzymatic activities displayed by ISAV HE molecules are presented for the first time. Three different recHE molecules were constructed: one representing a high virulent isolate, one a low virulent, while in the third a Ser 32 to Ala 32 amino acid substitution was introduced in the enzymatic catalytic site as inferred from the model. The three amino acid differences between the high and low virulent variants, of which two localized to the putative receptor-binding domain and one in the esterase domain, had no impact on receptor-binding or -release activities. In contrast, the Ser 32 amino acid substitution totally abolished enzymatic activity while receptor binding increased, as observed by agglutination of Atlantic salmon red blood cells. This demonstrates the essential role of a serine in the enzyme's catalytic site. In conclusion, structural analysis of ISAV HE in combination with selected recHE proteins gave insights into structure-function relationships and opens up for further studies aiming at dissecting molecular determinants of ISAV virulence.",

            "text": "Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) is a piscine orthomyxovirus, genus Isavirus (Kawaoka et al., 2005) , causing a systemic disease in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The ongoing devastating ISA disease outbreaks in Chile, threatening the country's entire Atlantic salmon farming industry (Mardones et al., 2009; Godoy et al., 2008) , is a reminder of the importance of this emerging disease. Similar to influenza A and B viruses, the ISAV is an enveloped virus with a genome consisting of eight negative sense single-stranded RNA segments encoding at least 10 proteins Clouthier et al., 2002; Falk et al., 2004) . ISAV has two major surface proteins; a 50 kDa fusion (F) protein which is encoded by gene segment 5 and responsible for fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Aspehaug et al., 2005) and the 38-43 kDa hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein encoded by gene segment 6, providing both the receptor-binding and the receptordestroying enzyme (RDE) activities Kross\u00f8y et al., 2001; Rimstad et al., 2001) . This functional organisation differs from influenza A and B viruses where the hemagglutinin (HA) has receptor-binding and fusion activities, while RDE activity is performed by the neuraminidase (NA) (Colman et al., 1983; Palese et al., 1974; Skehel, 1977, 1987) . In fact, ISAV HE shows higher functional similarity to the bovine and porcine torovirus and bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase proteins (BToV HE, PToV HE, BCoV HE), as well as to the influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein (InfC HEF) where all three functions are incorporated in one single surface protein (Herrler et al., 1988) . The X-ray crystallographic structures of BToV HE, PToV HE, BCoV HE and InfC HEF have been determined (Langereis et al., 2009; Zeng et al., 2008; Rosenthal et al., 1998) .",

            "text": "The RDE activity prevents the viruses from self-aggregation and promotes release of viral progenies from the infected cell (H\u00f6fling et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1995) . In addition, the RDE may also play a role early during infection (Brossmer et al., 1993; Huang et al., 1985; Matrosovich et al., 2004; Ohuchi et al., 1995; Strobl and Vlasak, 1993) . For influenza A viruses, a functional balance between the antagonistic functions of its receptor-binding-and RDE activities seems to be required for viral replicative fitness and virulence (Wagner et al., 2002; Lu et al., 2005; Kaverin et al., 1998; Chen et al., 2007; Gulati et al., 2005; Mitnaul et al., 2000; Baigent and McCauley, 2001; Shtyrya et al., 2009) . The function of the ISAV RDE and its role in virulence remains to be clarified. Enzyme inhibition studies indicate that the acetylesterase of the ISAV HE contains a serine in its active site, probably constituting a part of a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, similar to the RDE of the InfC HEF protein Kristiansen et al., 2002; Muchmore and Varki, 1987; Pleschka et al., 1995) . Furthermore, data from multiple sequence alignment including HE sequences from ISAV and other viruses suggest that these residues are located at position 32 for Ser, 261 for Asp and 264 for His . This remains to be confirmed by functional studies to provide conclusive evidence. The cellular receptor for ISAV has not yet been defined. While InfC HEF specifically binds to and deacetylates 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylsialic acid residues (Herrler et al., 1985; Rogers et al., 1986) , the most likely substrate for ISAV HE is 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylsialic acid (Helleb\u00f8 et al., 2004) .",

The acetylesterase responsible for the RDE activity allows the virus to detach (elute) from these erythrocytes. One general exception is Atlantic salmon erythrocytes. Most experiments point to the inability of the ISAV to elute from these cells Helleb\u00f8 et al., 2004) . Recent results, however, suggest that inability to elute from Atlantic salmon erythrocytes in some way can be related to virulence, as low virulent strains may elute (K. Falk, O.B. Dale, personal communication) . This contradicts the situation in influenza A and B viruses where an inhibition of the RDE hampers release of viral particles from the cell surface and is used as treatment against influenza infections in humans (Moscona, 2005; von Itzstein et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "Despite large differences in virulence between isolates, the ISAV genome is remarkably conserved (Markussen et al., 2008; Mjaaland et al., 2005 Mjaaland et al., , 2002 . The ISAV protein with highest sequence variation is the HE containing a highly polymorphic region (HPR) in the stalk of the protein, near the transmembrane domain (Mjaaland et al., 2002; Kross\u00f8y et al., 2001; Rimstad et al., 2001; Markussen et al., 2008) . It has been suggested that the HPR results from differential deletions of the full-length HPR (HPR0), possibly as a consequence of transmission from a viral reservoir to densely populated farmed Atlantic salmon (Mjaaland et al., 2002) . The presence of HPR0 has been confirmed in healthy wild and farmed Atlantic salmon (Cunningham et al., 2002; Cook-Versloot et al., 2004; Anonymous, 2005; Nylund et al., 2007; Markussen et al., 2008) . Moreover, ISAV isolated from fish with clinical ISA always contain a deletion in this region (Mjaaland et al., 2002; Nylund et al., 2007) . It has therefore been hypothesized that variations in the length of the HPR may affect the structure/plasticity of the molecule, which again may affect the receptor-binding affinities and RDE activities, as well as potential interactions with the F protein. The role of amino acid differences outside the HPR region on structure and/or function has not yet been addressed. The aim of this study was to identify different domains of the HE protein, including the active site of the RDE, by comparison to known HE structures. Functional testing of these predictions through mutagenesis and functional/quantitative analyses were made possible by the development of a recombinant secreted form of HE (recHE). In addition, the analysis was used to select different HE variants for quantitative comparisons of their functions.",

Fold recognition was performed with the GeneSilico (Kurowski and Bujnicki, 2003) and BioInfo (Bujnicki et al., 2001 ) meta-servers. These servers collect data from a large number of prediction methods and compare the results on a unified scale using a jury system (Ginalski et al., 2003) . Secondary structures for experimental structure data were classified with DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) and extracted using local software. Experimental structures were downloaded from RCSB/PDB (Berman et al., 2000) . Structurebased sequence alignment for the experimental structures was generated with FatCat (Ye and Godzik, 2003) , allowing for structural flexibility. Identification of receptor-ligand interactions in the experimental structures was done with the Ligand Explorer at RCSB (Berman et al., 2000) . Visualization and analysis of the alignment with ISAV HE was done with DeepView (SwissPDBViewer) 4.0 (Guex and Peitsch, 1997) .

This alignment is based on the FFAS predicted alignment of the ISAV HE sequence against each of the four structural templates, as well as the structure-based alignment of the experimental structures against each other. The structure-based alignments are taken directly from the FatCat (Ye and Godzik, 2003) pairwise alignments, adding the necessary gaps to get a consensus alignment of all four sequences. The structural similarity in the alignment is indicated with secondary structure elements of the experimental structures. The ISAV HE sequence was added to the structure-based alignment by using the consensus of FFAS alignments against each of the individual experimental structures. This turned out to be identical to the alignment against PToV HE, which has the most significant similarity to ISAV HE according to the FFAS fold recognition method. The alignment has been annotated with domain organisation according to PToV HE (Langereis et al., 2009) , indicated as receptor domain, esterase domain and membrane-proximal domain. The receptor domain is frequently annotated as a lectin domain in other publications, e.g. in Langereis et al. (2009) .

For the recHE4 and recHE7 samples, in absence of DCIC, the number of free beads was higher following 5-7 h incubation, as compared to 1-3 h (Fig. 4B) . In the presence of DCIC the amounts of free beads were similar after 1-3 h and 5-7 h incubation (Fig. 4B) , although the aggregates were smaller after the prolonged incubation (Fig. 4A) . It was not possible to identify any differences between recHE4 and recHE7 with respect to the level of hemagglutination.

For the negative controls, drNimA, rec empty-1 and beads only, the numbers of free beads (50-55) were unchanged regardless of incubation time or presence of DCIC (not shown). Proteins from two separate batches were tested and similar results obtained, supporting the reliability of the data. Together with the visual observations (Fig. 4A) , these results suggest that all three recHEs have an intact receptor-binding domain. Substitution of Ser 32 abolished elution of recHE from erythrocytes indicating the importance of this amino acid for the RDE and elution, but not for receptor binding. The three amino acid differences between recHE4 and recHE7 have no or minimal effect on hemagglutination, suggesting that they do not have a major impact on receptor binding.",

RecHE4 S32A -coated beads, on the other hand, clearly aggregated rRBCs. While pre-incubating with DCIC did not change the hemagglutination activity of the recHE4 S32A , the presence of DCIC resulted in formation of small aggregates using the recHE4 and recHE7 samples (Fig. 4C) . Agglutination of rRBCs was not observed with any of the negative controls (only drNimA shown in Fig. 4C ). This is consistent with the results obtained with AsRBC, but the level of hemagglutination induced by the three recHEs was generally weaker for rRBC as compared to AsRBCs ( Fig. 4A and C) .

Together this constitutes a Ser-His-Asp active site triad similar to the one found in traditional esterases, although the topology of this fold is atypical compared to more traditional lipases and esterases (M\u00f8lgaard et al., 2000) . In particular the important strand-turn-helix motif for the active site Ser (the nucleophilic elbow motif) is less well defined in esterases that are similar to InfC HEF (M\u00f8lgaard et al., 2000) . Still, the fact that these motifs are conserved is consistent with the experimental results showing that the ISAV contains an acetylesterase with a serine in the active site Kristiansen et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "It is however important to realize that significant fold recognition does not necessarily guarantee an optimal sequence alignment. In particular the ISAV HE receptor domain seems to be less similar to the template sequences than the enzyme domain, and the receptor domain is also approximately 40 residues shorter than the corresponding template domains. Virus sequences show a high degree of reassortment (Lai, 1992; Brown, 2000) , meaning that alternative domains (and potentially alternative folds) can be combined and recombined from different sources. The weak sequence similarity may reflect the fact that for example InfC HEF specifi- cally deacetylates 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylsialic acid residues, which is a high-affinity receptor determinant for binding of influenza C virus to erythrocytes, while the enzyme substrate for ISAV HE is 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylsialic acid (Helleb\u00f8 et al., 2004; Herrler et al., 1985; Rogers et al., 1986) . The cellular receptor for ISAV has not yet been defined but solid phase binding assays have shown that HE specifically binds 4-O-acetylated sialic acids, and 5-N-acetyl-4-Oacetylsialic acids probably represent a major receptor determinant for the virus (Helleb\u00f8 et al., 2004) . In the elucidation of the receptor domain structure it was assumed that the general fold of this domain is conserved, based on similarity in secondary structure content between ISAV HE and the other sequences (not shown). The alignment in Fig. 1 and the visualization in Fig. 2A does not necessarily represent an optimal solution, which is indicated, e.g. by the pattern of Cys-Cys bridges. These bridges are not completely conserved in the known structures (shown in Fig. 1) , indicating a certain flexibility. This is consistent with previous studies showing that disulphide bonds are only moderately conserved between distant homologues (Thangudu et al., 2008) . However, the current alignment leads to some unmatched Cys pairs, indicating that some shifts in alignment and probably also in tertiary structure may be needed for an optimal model, in particular in the receptor domain. The very low sequence similarity in this region makes it difficult to judge the relative merit of alternative alignments, and in general the current alignment seems reasonable. In addition to the conserved active site residues also the oxyanion hole residues (Gly 59 and Asn 89 ), involved in stabilizing the transition state, seem to be conserved. The majority of the receptor domain ligand binding residues identified from the experimental structures are found in regions with alignment between ISAV HE and the template structures. There may be an important difference in esterase ligand binding, where a loop with an Arg implied in substrate coordination seems to be missing in ISAV HE (indicated in Fig. 2B ). It is known that alternative sequence positions may be involved in substrate coordination, e.g. in BToV HE (Langereis et al., 2009 ), but no clear alternative candidate has been found in ISAV HE. This may indicate important differences in substrate binding in ISAV HE, possibly consistent with different substrate specificity.",

The hemagglutination and acetylesterase activities (Figs. 4 and 5) of the recHE proteins suggest that they adopt a conformation akin to the viral protein Kristiansen et al., 2002) . Coupled onto magnetic beads through their C-terminal His 6 -tag, recHE4 and recHE7 both displayed receptor-binding abilities as observed by agglutination of AsRBCs. The presence of an intact RDE activity for these two proteins was indicated by the observed elution of recHE-coupled beads from AsRBCs at later time points, with further evidence provided by the absence of elution in the presence of the serine esterase inhibitor DCIC, which attacks a serine in the enzyme's active site. Such elution caused by the RDE activity is not observed in agglutination assays using AsRBCs and purified ISAV4 parti-cles, even after a period of 6-24 h incubation . The apparent contradiction may be explained by conformational differences between the native HE incorporated into the viral membrane versus the recombinant and bead-bound HE. In fact, Orlova et al. (2003) showed for horseradish peroxidase that differences in enzymatic properties are due to conformational variations between the recombinant and the native horseradish peroxidase. Also, the oligomerization status may vary between the native and the recombinant protein and can thus affect both structure as well as functional properties.",

This seems consistent with the model, where none of these amino acid differences are located in the actual ligand binding site.

In any case it is clear that the esterase activity is the mechanism behind the elution. The mutant protein recHE4 S32A has a stronger ability to agglutinate AsRBCs as compared to both recHE4 and recHE7. The mutated protein has no detectable RDE/acetylesterase activity as shown by lack of elution and enzyme activity in the esterase assay. Hemagglutination is thus a function related to the RDE activity which may serve to regulate the level of receptor binding by the virus. Moreover the mutant protein was not affected by DCIC. This provides functional evidence for the requirement of Ser 32 in HE function. As suggested by the model ( Fig. 2A and B ) the residue is part of a catalytic triad, Ser 32 -His 264 -Asp 261 , constituting the enzyme's active site, which is also consistent with the assumptions made by Falk and co-workers . However, the roles of His 264 and Asp 261 remain to be proven. Of course, the lack of esterase activity displayed by the recHE4 S32A mutant may be a consequence of an improperly folded enzyme domain. However, the residues in the catalytic triad are in their modelled positions all located to loops, and the Ser to Ala mutation will thus probably not affect the framework structure.",

This may reflect a difference in receptor density, in affinity to the receptor of the two RBC types by the two recombinant proteins, and/or a stronger RDE activity towards the receptor determinant on rRBCs. RecHE4 S32A agglutination of rRBCs was both obvious and independent of DCIC, as observed with AsRBCs, suggesting that the esterase activity regulates the binding to the rRBC receptor as well.",

Hence, the differences in virulence between ISAV4 and ISAV7 are most likely not linked to variations in these two activities. However, Aspehaug and co-workers have shown that co-expression of HE and the fusion protein increased cell-cell fusion (Aspehaug et al., 2005) , opening up for the possibility that the three amino acid differences between HE4 and HE7 may affect the fusion process and in this way contribute to the differences in virulence between ISAV4 and ISAV7. In addition, the possibility that that the ISAV F protein may be involved in receptor binding similar to what has been reported for the paramyxovirus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), should not be excluded (Karron et al., 1997; Karger et al., 2001; Techaarpornkul et al., 2001) . Moreover, sequence differences in the remaining gene segments of these virus isolates may also account for the virulence differences (Markussen et al., 2008) .",

The two functions were studied using purified secreted forms of recombinant HEs from two different virus isolates. The differences in virulence displayed by these two isolates could not be linked to the functional activities of recombinant HEs. Moreover, using information from sequence analyses and related structures, a HE variant containing a single amino acid mutation (Ser 32 to Ala 32 ) at the putative catalytic site of the enzyme was generated. This mutated protein displayed no enzymatic activity but intact receptor-binding ability. This provides experimental evidence for the importance of Ser 32 in enzyme activity.",
