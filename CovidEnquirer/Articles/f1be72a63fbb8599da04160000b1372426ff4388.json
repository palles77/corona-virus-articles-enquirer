            "text": "In 1997, a Health and Human Services-commissioned report by the Lewin Group (1) identified the trends that were affecting public health and clinical laboratories. Those forces are still at work. Table 1 is a summary of some of the economic forces, including the rise of managed care organizations and their attendant accumulation of bargaining power with reference laboratories. In the face of ever-rising health care costs, hospitals are enduring unrelenting pressure to reduce laboratory costs, resulting in the formation of consortium laboratories among hospital groups, referrals of specimens to private reference laboratories, closings of smaller hospital laboratories, and reductions in laboratory staff. Table 2 shows the forces at work for clinical laboratories, which are fighting battles on two fronts to maintain staff levels against further erosion. Management is asking for workforce reductions, while fewer qualified applicants are available for open positions. With the closing of many medical technology schools over the past two decades, graduating medical technologists, clinical laboratory scientists, and technicians number less than half of projected workforce needs. At the same time, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has placed new demands for secure patient information handling, adding another burden on laboratory staff (1, 2) . Table 3 lists the forces at work with public health laboratories. While engaged in traditional public health activities, these laboratories are experiencing multiple new pressures, including HIPAA and CLIA regulatory compliance issues, the need to be prepared for analytic response to bioterrorism acts, loss of state funding with a parallel need to bill Medicaid for patient testing and provide testing on a fee-for-service basis. While a significant amount of funding support and technology transfer has accompanied the charge to state and local public health laboratories to develop capability for bioterrorism testing, state funding for traditional public health testing has withered (1) .",

Several new initiatives have been launched to facilitate the collaboration of laboratorians, but while most public health laboratorians know what clinical laboratories do, the reverse is often not true. Table 4 illustrates the parallel, but different, roles each plays. Clinical laboratories are focused on patient care, while public health laboratories are focused on the health of the entire population. Clinical laboratory information is directed to physicians, and from them, ends at patient care. In contrast, public health laboratories gather information for public health experts and epidemiologists, who must determine the cause of illnesses and outbreaks affecting patients in many hospitals, detect new and unusual threats to the health of the community, and respond to these threats and prevent them. These roles are complementary, and as many laboratory professionals are discovering, mutually supportive.",

In 1994, a CDC strategy document (6) outlined the need for the formation of networks to gather information to detect, report, and analyze information regarding infection.

            "text": "Clinical laboratories have traditionally referred isolates to public health laboratories for confirmation and serotyping, but beginning in 1998, these isolates were subjected to a new powerful method to type the strains. Public health laboratories began to use pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to type isolates of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and other foodborne-illness pathogens, subdividing these isolates into closely related groups or clones, and allowing epidemiologists to efficiently investigate cases of infections and determine the cause. Often, clusters of cases are seen immediately by public health laboratory scientists when a group of isolates with a unique pattern are observed. Epidemiologists can investigate smaller numbers of cases and spend less time collecting the information that points to a particular food product. This has occurred many times since the initiation of the PulseNet system. Outbreaks caused by Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., E. coli O157, and Camplylobacter and Listeria spp. are detected, and the numbers of cases are limited when the incriminated food product is determined and recalled. Clinical laboratories are being encouraged to refer such pathogens quickly, rather than letting a group of isolates accumulate for convenient transport to a state laboratory, where outbreaks of foodborne illness can be identified rapidly, resulting in limitations on the extent of outbreaks (7) . PFGE patterns uploaded by public health laboratories to the CDC PulseNet database are examined by epidemiologists looking for the appearance of clusters that cross state borders. Numerous multi-state and national foodborne-illness outbreaks have been uncovered that could not have been detected by other means. PulseNet works because clinical laboratories are effective in culturing agents of foodborne illness and referring these isolates quickly to public health laboratories that perform PFGE typing, conduct a statewide analysis, and then upload this information to the CDC database for nationwide analysis. This partnership has raised the level of detection of foodborne illness to unprecedented levels, virtually ensuring that no multistate outbreak of foodborne illness of any significant magnitude will go undetected. When three state laboratories determine a strain to be the same by PFGE typing, the recovery of a single isolate by each of three clinical microbiologists in three different states might be enough to detect a nationwide food problem.",

Sporadic cases are those in which an outbreak has not occurred but some part of the food system has failed.

While this technical advance is certainly desirable, it may not be economically feasible for most clinical laboratories. The authors point out the recently developed capability of public health laboratories for testing for SARS, coronavirus, and variola as examples of agents that can be identified through cooperation between clinical and public health laboratories.",
