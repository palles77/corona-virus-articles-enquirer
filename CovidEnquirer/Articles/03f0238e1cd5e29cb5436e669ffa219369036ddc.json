[5] [6] [7] [8] Benefits from colostrum may be attributed to protective Ig as well as high levels of nutrients and bioactive compounds that stimulate postnatal growth and development. 9 Calves have historically been defined as having failure of passive transfer (FPT) if the serum IgG concentration is less than 10 g/L when sampled between 24 and 48 hours of age, based on increased mortality risk below this threshold. [10] [11] [12] However, this definition of FPT needs to be reevaluated, given that recent studies have described reduced morbidity in calves to be associated with incrementally higher serum IgG levels ( Fig. 1) . 4, 12, 13 Although the US dairy industry has shown steady improvement in colostrum and calf management over the past few decades, a recent national dairy study reported FPT to affect 15.6% of calves tested, 14 indicating a need for continued efforts to improve colostrum management. This article reviews the process of colostrogenesis and colostrum composition, and discusses the key components of developing a successful colostrum management program. In addition, it discusses methods for monitoring and presents new goals for passive immunity in dairy herds.",

            "text": "Bovine colostrum consists of a mixture of lacteal secretions and constituents of blood serum, most notably Ig and other serum proteins, which accumulate in the mammary gland during the prepartum dry period. 15 This process begins several weeks before calving, under the influence of lactogenic hormones including prolactin, and ceases abruptly at parturition. Important constituents of colostrum include Ig, leukocytes, growth factors, hormones, nonspecific antimicrobial factors, and nutrients. Concentrations of many of these components are greatest in the first secretions harvested after calving (first milking colostrum), then decline steadily over the next 6 milkings (transition milk) to reach the lower concentrations routinely measured in saleable whole milk ( Table 1 ). 15 Fig. 1 . Nondiseased probability for preweaned heifer calves by days of age and serum IgG concentration categories. Corresponding with serum IgG levels of greater than or equal to 25.0 g/L, 18.0 to 24.9 g/L, 10 to 17.9 g/L, and less than 10.0 g/L were serum total protein categories of greater than or equal to 6.2 g/dL, 5.8 to 6.1 g/dL, 5.1 to 5.7 g/dL, and less than 5.1 g/dL, and Brix score categories of greater than or equal to 9.4%, 8.9% to 9.3%, 8.1% to 8.8%, and less than 8.1%, respectively. 131 Immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM account for approximately 85% to 90%, 5%, and 7%, respectively, of the total Ig in colostrum, with IgG 1 accounting for 80% to 90% of the total IgG. 16 Although levels are highly variable among cows, one study reported that mean colostral concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM were 75 g/L, 4.4 g/L, and 4.9 g/L, respectively. 17 IgG, and IgG 1 in particular, is transferred from the blood stream across the mammary barrier into colostrum by a specific transport mechanism; receptors on the mammary alveolar epithelial cells capture IgG 1 from the extracellular fluid, and the molecule undergoes endocytosis, transport, and eventually release into the luminal secretions. 16 The alveolar epithelial cells cease expressing this receptor, most likely in response to increasing prolactin concentrations, at the onset of lactation. 18 Smaller amounts of IgA and IgM are largely derived from local synthesis by plasmacytes in the mammary gland. 16 Although not well understood, colostral transfer of IgE also occurs and may be important in providing early protection against intestinal parasites. 19 After absorption into the calf's circulation, the duration of passive immunity from maternal Ig is highly variable and depends to a great extent on the total mass of Ig consumed and absorbed within the first 24 hours of life. The rate of decay of colostral antibodies can be influenced by multiple factors, including active viral infections or vaccination. [20] [21] [22] Maternal Leukocytes",

            "text": "Fresh colostrum contains leukocytes of maternal origin; in cattle, macrophages and lymphocytes (mononuclear cells) make up the largest proportion of maternal colostral leukocytes. 23 Maternal colostral leukocytes enter the tissues of neonates following ingestion or enteral delivery in a variety of species, including rats, sheep, swine, and cattle, [24] [25] [26] and feeding colostrum containing maternal leukocytes has been associated with modified neonatal immune responses. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Blood mononuclear cells from calves fed colostrum containing maternal leukocytes developed the ability to activate cell-mediated immune responses by the time calves were 1 week of age, compared with 3 weeks of age for calves fed leukocyte-free colostrum. 27 Significant differences in percentage and degree of blood mononuclear cell activation were measured in calves receiving colostrum containing maternal leukocytes, compared with calves fed leukocyte-free maternal colostrum or frozen colostrum. [29] [30] [31] Both freezing 28 and heat treatment (Godden, unpublished, 2010) of colostrum kill most if not all colostral leukocytes. Blood mononuclear cells from 1-day-old calves fed colostrum containing maternal leukocytes were significantly more responsive to bovine viral diarrhea virus, compared with day-old calves that received frozen colostrum or leukocyte-free colostrum. 28 In contrast, there was no difference between treatment groups in the response to a mycobacterial antigen that the calves' dams had not encountered, suggesting that antigen-specific responses measured in a calf following ingestion of maternal colostral leukocytes are related to specific immune memory in the dam. In support of this, cell-mediated immune responses in piglets that nursed maternal colostrum containing leukocytes were significantly higher if their dams had been vaccinated against the tested antigen than if their dams had not been vaccinated. 32 Although research has not evaluated the degree of difference in responses induced by colostral leukocytes from a calf's own dam versus colostral leukocytes from another cow, cross-fostering experiments in piglets suggest that effects of colostral leukocytes on neonatal cell-mediated immunity are greatest when the colostrum contains leukocytes from the neonate's dam. 33 Although multiple studies have confirmed that colostral leukocytes modify immune responses in calves in ways that seem relevant to protective immunity, to date research has not clearly shown an unequivocally beneficial effect of colostral leukocytes on practical outcomes such as calf respiratory or enteric morbidity, or induction of specific and measurable protective immunity following vaccination. Colostral leukocytes fed alone are not sufficient to protect calves from fatal disease in the neonatal period, 34 and recent studies comparing proportions of calves affected by naturally occurring diarrhea or respiratory disease after calves consume fresh maternal colostrum containing leukocytes, or frozen colostrum from their own dam 31 or other cows, 35 have shown small or variable differences in disease between the groups. Regarding the effect of colostral leukocytes on vaccine responses, Meganck and colleagues 36 evaluated humoral and cell-mediated responses to tetanus toxoid vaccination at 2, 5, or 10 days of age in calves fed pooled colostral whey with maternal leukocytes added, or calves fed only pooled colostral whey; this work suggested that colostral leukocytes influenced both tetanus toxoid-specific cellmediated and humoral responses in calves, but the number of calves tested was small, and the effects measured varied substantially for calves vaccinated at 2, 5, or 10 days of age. Langel and colleagues 37 evaluated total (ie, not antigen-specific) monocyte and lymphocyte responses by measuring relative numbers and activation state of calf blood mononuclear cell subsets after routine calfhood vaccination; these investigators found significant differences between groups at certain time points over the months following vaccination. However, the clinical relevance of these differences for immunity against specific pathogens, or resistance to disease, was not defined. In summary, colostral leukocytes modify calf immune responses, and these effects may affect cow health and immunity months or years later. However, to date, effects of colostral leukocytes on practically important health outcomes have not been unequivocally identified, which may in part because it is logistically challenging and expensive to conduct research to measure effects of colostral leukocytes on calf immunity and health, so trials to date may not have included enough calves to provide adequate statistical power to identify small but important health differences.",

            "text": "In addition to Ig for passive immunity, colostrum also contains high amounts of nutrients and nonnutritive biologically active factors that stimulate maturation and function of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract (GIT). 9 The total solids content (percentage) in first milking colostrum and whole milk in Holstein cows was reported to average 23.9% and 12.9%, respectively (see Table 1 ). Much of the increase in colostrum solids content is attributed to a more than 4-fold increase in protein content of colostrum versus milk, this being caused by significant increases in both Ig and casein content. 2 The crude fat content of first milking Holstein colostrum (6.7%) is also significantly higher than for milk (3.6%). 15 Energy from fat and lactose in colostrum is critical for thermogenesis and body temperature regulation. Certain vitamins and minerals, including calcium, magnesium, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin E, carotene, riboflavin, vitamin B12, folic acid, choline, and selenium, are also found in increased concentrations in bovine colostrum. 15, 38 Nonnutritive factors found in increased levels in colostrum include, but are not limited to, growth factors, hormones, cytokines, and nonspecific antimicrobial factors. Trypsin inhibitor, a compound found in colostrum in concentrations nearly 100 times greater than in milk, serves to protect Ig and other proteins from proteolytic degradation in the intestine of the neonatal calf. Bioactive components with antimicrobial activity include lactoferrin, lysozyme, and lactoperoxidase. [39] [40] [41] Oligosaccharides may provide protection against pathogens by acting as competitive inhibitors for the binding sites on the epithelial surfaces of the intestine. 38 It has also been suggested that certain oligosaccharides in colostrum may contribute to gut microbiome development by serving as a substrate to beneficial microorganisms such as Bifidobacterium, although this hypothesis requires further study. 42 Growth factors in bovine colostrum include transforming growth factor beta-2, growth hormone, and insulin. Colostral insulinlike growth factor I and II may be key to regulating development of the GIT of bovine neonates, including stimulation of mucosal growth, brush-border enzymes, intestinal DNA synthesis, and increased villus size, resulting in enhanced absorptive capacity and glucose uptake. 9, 43 Another intriguing and potentially beneficial factor found in high levels in colostrum may be microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are short, noncoding RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, and could represent one possible method of postnatal signaling from the mother to the neonate. Although studies are needed to describe their functional significance in calves, early research in other species suggests that, once absorbed by the neonate, MiRNAs from colostrum may be important in the differentiation and functional development of the intestinal epithelium, 44 and could also play an important role in the maturation of the neonate's immune system. 45 These nutrients and nonnutritive factors, combined with benefits of disease protection from Ig, may contribute to the short-term and long-term benefits from improved colostrum intake, including improved rate of gain, reduced age at first calving, improved first and second lactation milk production, and reduced tendency for culling during the first lactation. [5] [6] [7] [8] Further research is needed to investigate the concept of epigenetic programming or imprinting effects of colostrum on both short-term and long-term health and performance. 9",

In order to achieve the more ambitious goals for excellent passive transfer, presented later in this article, the authors estimate that producers need to deliver greater than or equal to 300 g of IgG shortly after birth. The 2 major factors affecting the mass of Ig consumed are the quality and volume of colostrum fed. Factors affecting the absorption of Ig molecules into circulation include the quickness with which the first colostrum feeding is provided after birth, bacterial contamination of colostrum, and metabolic status of the calf. This article next discusses these key factors, strategies for minimizing bacterial contamination of colostrum, the use of colostrum supplements (CSs) and replacers, benefits of multiple feedings, and benefits of extended colostrum or transition milk feeding after intestinal closure.",

Although some studies have reported that exposure to high ambient temperatures during late pregnancy is associated with poorer colostrum composition, including lower mean concentrations of colostral IgG and IgA, 49, 58 others have reported the opposite. 46 It has been suggested that any negative effects of heat stress on colostrum quality might be associated with reduced dry matter intake or reduced mammary blood flow resulting in impaired transfer of IgG and nutrients to the udder. 58 Season may also have an impact on colostrum yield, although this is less well described. In a year-long study of a 2500-cow Jersey dairy in Texas, colostrum yield was highest in June but declined during the fall and winter months. 59 A low-temperature humidity index and a shortened photoperiod 1 month before and at calving were both highly correlated with reduced colostrum yield. The investigators hypothesized that shortened photoperiod may reduce colostrum production because of its impact on melatonin and prolactin, hormones known to be involved with colostrogenesis. However, a study that experimentally manipulated photoperiod reported no effect of photoperiod during the dry period on colostrum Colostrum Management for Dairy Calves quality or yield. 60 Producers should adopt heat-abatement strategies for prepartum cows and heifers and are advised to bank frozen colostrum to meet needs during low colostrum production months. 59 ",

Suckling the dam is the least preferred approach, because delays in suckling and failure to control quality and volume ingested can result in higher rates of FPT. 79 When colostrum is delivered with an esophageal tube feeder, the esophageal groove reflex is not triggered, resulting in fluid being deposited into the forestomachs. However, this is not a significant limitation because outflow of colostrum from the forestomachs to the abomasum and small intestine occurs for the most part within 3 hours. 80 As such, equal and acceptable levels of passive transfer are achieved when colostrum is delivered by nipple bottle or esophageal tube feeder, provided that a sufficient volume of colostrum is delivered. 81, 82 One study reported that calves drinking from a nipple bottle consumed an average of only 2.2 L (range, 1-4 L). 83 As such, producers feeding colostrum by nipple bottle should be prepared to deliver any remaining colostrum using a tube feeder, or provide a second bottle feeding within 6 hours, for those calves that do not voluntarily consume their whole allotment. Veterinarians should train staff on how to safely administer colostrum using tube feeders. Equipment sanitation and maintenance are important for both bottles and tube feeders.",

From a study by Calloway and colleagues, 128 Tyler proposed (Personal Communication, 2002) that a successful passive transfer program was one in which 90% of sampled calves test 5.0 to 5.2 g/dL or higher. 132 However, one concern with this approach to setting goals includes the notion that \"failure\" should be used to describe calves with no measurable IgG, whereas \"adequate\" does not convey whether an optimal amount of IgG has been absorbed by the calf. In addition, a single cutoff that expresses failure versus adequate passive transfer is too simplistic, because it fails to recognize that increasing concentrations of IgG or STP are associated with reducing morbidity risk and improved calf performance. Studies by Furman-Fratczak and colleagues 13 and Windeyer and colleagues 12 showed that dairy calves with serum IgG levels greater than or equal to 15 g/L and STP greater than or equal to 5.7 g/dL, respectively, experienced lower rates of respiratory disease. In beef calves, Dewell and colleagues 133 reported lower morbidity rates when serum IgG level was greater than or equal to 24 g/L. Based on these and other studies, including the USDA National Animal Health Monitoring System's Dairy 2014 study, 4,46 a reevaluation of the FPT individual and herd-based cut points was conducted. A group of calf experts from the United States and Canada convened in 2018 to review and propose revised individual and herd-based evaluation standards. The proposed consensus standard is based on the association of lower morbidity and higher values of serum IgG, because mortality risk is associated with serum IgG values less than 10 g/L. The proposed standard includes 4 categories: excellent, good, fair, and poor. These categories can be applied to individual calves and to the operation for herd-based evaluation based on the percentage of calves that should be represented in each category ( Table 2) . Because serum IgG level is not commonly measured, equivalent STP and Brix levels are provided for the 4 categories. The proposed consensus standard is meant to set higher goals for calf health in the US dairy industry.",

As such, the STP and Brix cut points suggested for monitoring passive transfer in calves fed maternal colostrum are frequently inaccurate for calves fed CR. Veterinarians are encouraged to use STP or serum Brix measures to monitor the effectiveness of a CR feeding program only if independently conducted studies are available describing the relationship between STP or serum Brix measures and serum IgG for the specific commercial CR product in use on the farm. If this information is not available for specific CR products, veterinarians are advised to periodically submit frozen serum samples for laboratory analysis of IgG using direct methods such as RID.",

Although good progress has been made in the past 20 years, there remains a considerable opportunity for many dairy producers to improve their colostrum management practices, resulting in improved short-term and long-term health and performance of the animals. Producers should provide calves with a sufficient volume of clean, high-quality colostrum within the first few hours of life. Additional benefits may be captured by providing multiple feedings and by extended feeding of colostrum or transition milk after gut closure. Colostrum replacers are useful tools if clean, high-quality maternal colostrum is not available. Ongoing monitoring helps producers to more quickly identify and correct problems within the colostrum management program. ",
