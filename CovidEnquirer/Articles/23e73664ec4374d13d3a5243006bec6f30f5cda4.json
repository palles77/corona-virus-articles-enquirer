Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. This in turn comprised of ten critical steps and its impact on quality of data was identified through expert input. This was followed by analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team.",

The critical role of public health, in the context of disease surveillance is recognized by these regulations, with recommendations for electronic laboratory reporting (ELR). ELR refers to the electronic transmission of labs related to reportable conditions to public health [4] . The emphasis on interoperability in recent legislations [5] and roadmaps [6] is facilitating the focus on electronic movement of data across healthcare settings. Many public health agencies have seen a trend towards centralization of information technology services which adds another layer of complexity to interoperability efforts. Given this landscape, it is essential to understand the process of data exchange and its impact on quality of data being transmitted, as this is a crucial step in interoperability. In addition, this holds broad implications for future priority transactions such as electronic case reporting to public health.",

Subsequent studies have assessed the role of intermediaries such as Health Information Exchanges (HIE) [9] [10] [11] to facilitate ELR and reported better completeness of data with HIE support. Presently, studies have begun to focus on provider reporting of notifiable diseases [12, 13] , as moving to electronic case notification [14] [15] [16] along with ELR will be great progress to support overall public health disease surveillance. Challenges in adoption and use of recommended codes [17] [18] [19] and need for an informatics savvy workforce [20] were identified as some of the issues in the move towards ELR [21] .",

Its scope has expanded to include non-infectious diseases such as blood lead surveillance and birth defects. It's a person-centric surveillance system which currently holds ~1,279,986 events across infectious diseases, lead and community and family health programs. Approximately 153,880 lab tests/results were reported electronically for 2017 across six health systems and four reference labs. Many healthcare systems are currently on a waiting list for either onboarding/move to electronic exchange or upgrade to better version of reporting standard.",

Various subject matter experts (n=9) were identified spanning across the informatics team that supports MEDSS operations, public health program professionals who are users of the MEDSS system and its data, and the Information Technology (IT) team which supports the data exchange process. The focus included both onboarding (process OJPHI of shifting to electronic exchange for either new reporting or migration/upgrade to different standard) and on-going submissions. ELR is unique in that reporting can occur from either EHR or from LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) and can occur from healthcare delivery organization or from reference laboratories and these were taken into consideration. Interviews were conducted in an open-ended/discussion format and were done over time frame of November 2017 through February 2018. Based on these discussions, two high level categories of data exchange process which could impact data quality were identified: onboarding for electronic lab reporting and internal data exchange routing. Figure 1 displays the ELR onboarding process and includes the testing and validation suite of tools offered in public domain by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [33] . The six identified key processes that influence quality of data are numbered A through F (A -mapping of tests and results to appropriate codes, B -NIST test bed for testing of messages, C -submit test HL7 messages, D -solicit HL7 messages with test cases (e.g. specific tests, seasonal diseases), E -technical review, F -program review). Figure 2 displays the internal data exchange routing process which includes the PHIN Messaging System (PHIN MS) [34] , a CDC provided software that serves as a transport mechanism for effective movement of messages. This part comprises of four main components numbered G through J (G -PHIN MS, H -Lab code list database validation, I -Rhapsody\u00ae Integration Engine [35] rules, J -mapping in MEDSS).",

Next, assessment of completeness of race and ethnicity fields before and after implementation of demographic data import feature in ELR was completed. Using Influenza reporting as a scenario, the number of non-reportable tests that get submitted and added to data in MEDSS was examined.

Each step in the process was deemed critical in its impact on the quality of data which moves across clinical sector and public health. Table 1 lists the six identified key processes for ELR onboarding, relevant sub-processes/notes and their influence including both DQ metric and DQ dimension. All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping on EHR end had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The results from analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team is presented in Table 3 . Evaluation for cases which are not mapped to any disease program and assigned to \"other/unknown\" category yielded 952 cases. Assessment of messages for these cases noted an absence of LOINC and/or SNOMED codes and their combination pair for disease assignment. Next, the analysis focused on submission of non-reportable respiratory diseases along with reportable conditions (Influenza) due to issues with special lab test panel, and this identified 366 cases. This was followed by evaluating the number of incoming messages which get rejected due to errors and there currently isn't any process that keeps track of it. The corresponding impact on data quality metrics due to these identified issues are also presented in Table 3 . An enhancement was implemented in January 2018 to import demographic data (race, ethnicity) from ELR feeds and this evaluation presented in Table 4 . Of the total of 3,651 electronic lab messages received from January through February 2018, data on Race was present in 2,310 messages and 1,680 messages received in that time frame had data on Ethnicity. Comparison of this new data with already existing race and ethnicity data in MEDSS obtained through case reporting and follow-up investigations revealed 270 number of messages wherein race from ELR feed was different than one currently recorded in MEDSS.

Some of these exchange mechanisms require technical assistance for either submitter (e.g. labs, providers) and the receiver (e.g. public health) or both of them. National projects such as Digital Bridge [37] and APHL Informatics Messaging Services (AIMS) [38] are aimed to assist in data exchange across jurisdictional boundaries in public health.
