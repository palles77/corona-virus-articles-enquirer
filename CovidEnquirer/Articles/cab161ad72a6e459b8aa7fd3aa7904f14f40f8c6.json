Despite possible positivity for urinary pneumococcal antigen owing to asymptomatic carriage, some paediatricians still preferred using it as a screening tool, because Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common pneumonia pathogen in children <5 years old. For possible M. pneumoniae co-infection, we considered three situations as positive results (summarized in the Supplementary material, Data S1). Clinical laboratory data on admission and peak or nadir values during hospitalization were collected. White blood cell count >15 000/mL was defined as leucocytosis but a count of <5000/mL was defined as leucopenia. Platelet count >450 000/mL was defined as thrombocytosis and <150 000/mL as thrombocytopenia.

Among our studied cohort, 41.4% of paediatric patients with acute respiratory infections exhibited HAdV infection, with~3.4% exhibiting co-infection identified by viral culture instead of real-time PCR. This might explain the underestimated rate of co-infection; however, our findings might reflect a community outbreak of HAdV, whereas most cases admitted to the hospital were due to more severe clinical presentations. Notably, none of our cases involved a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. This finding might be explained by 75% of the patients being >3 years old, as well as diagnoses by clinical physicians of bacterial infection rather than viral infection due to leucocytosis and high CRP levels.",

Life-threatening complications were also reported in children with disabilities during an HAdV-7 outbreak in a residential facility for severely disabled children [31] . Lai et al.

Pneumonia was also the most common clinical diagnosis (89%), with half of these patients subsequently developing respiratory failure.

            "text": "HAdV-7 caused more severe clinical symptoms, two, one and 22 hexon sequences from HAdV-7 isolated in 2002, 2004 and 2011, respectively, were analysed in this study. The 22 sequences isolated in 2011 were identical, but contained four substitutions at nucleotide positions 771, 1286, 1319 and 1785 not present in the other three sequences from 2002 and 2004. These substitutions included two synonymous (F257 and I595) and two non-synonymous (S429Y and Q440L) amino acid mutations. To compare these 22 strains with 82 others available in GenBank, a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) was constructed, revealing that these strains were grouped with and identical to 22 other strains, including Taiwanese strains isolated in 2011, Chinese strains isolated in 2009 and 2015, a Russian strain isolated in 2014 (Accession no. KU361344), and a strain from the USA isolated in 2014 (Accession no. KT963081). The three sequences from 2002 and 2004 were identical to a strain isolated in the USA (Accession no. AY601634) in 1997. These findings indicated that the hexon gene sequences isolated from HAdV-7-infected Taiwanese children were highly conserved.",

Among these, 11 severe and 11 non-severe cases are marked with black and white circles, respectively, and three cases isolated in 2002 and 2004 are marked with triangles.
