The sensitivity (75%) and specificity (100%) of the rapid test for C. parvum were relatively high compared to modified Ziehl-Neelsen (MZN) staining. The aim of the present study was to evaluate further these commercial rapid assays for detecting BCV, rotavirus A and C. parvum in faecal samples using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (BCV and rotavirus) and a sedimentation-flotation technique (C. parvum) as gold standards.",
