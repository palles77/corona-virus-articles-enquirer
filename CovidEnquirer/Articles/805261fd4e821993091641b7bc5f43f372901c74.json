The TTF theory argues that Information Technology (IT) is very helpful for individual performance, only if the functionality provided by IT is suitable for individual tasks [21] . A number of studies have investigated the antecedents and consequences of TTF in various task and technological contexts. In particular, there are three groups of TTF antecedents proposed in the theoretical model [21] , illustrated in Fig. 2 . In this study, IT will be implemented in the form of social media as it appears to be the most accessible IT for SMEs. This technological need will be mapped to the business processes of SMEs. Based on this mapping parts of the business process that can be improved by the use of IT (social media) can be identified.",

The stages of research can be seen in Fig. 4 . The study begins with problem formulation. In this stage, the researcher aims to find the existence of an association or influence of the use of IT on the performance of an organization. The IT investigated in this study is social media. The problem is formulated based on previous studies about the impact of social media usage on the business processes of an organization or the performance of the business process. After formulating the research, a literature review is conducted. First, the keywords that are used as a \"search term\" are determined. The search terms in this study are \"Social Media, SMEs, Information Technology, Task-Technology Fit, Business Processes, and PCF\". The search for previous literature was carried out on a database of scientific publications and displaying search results according to the \"search term\" used. However, not all studies that match the \"search term\" could be used as references. The required keywords were not simultaneously used in one search. The authors combined 2 keywords such as \"Business Process AND PCF\", then reviewed several papers that appear and chose which paper could be used as a reference. Similar processes are done using other keywords such as \"Business Process AND Information Technology\" or \"Business Processes AND Social Media\". Finally, the keywords \"Business Process AND Social Media AND Task-Technology Fit\", are used as search terms combined with \"Business Process Performance\". To analyze and select the papers, the authors set inclusion and exclusion criteria for the papers. Papers included are those that discuss Social Media in SMEs, or Information Technology that uses Social Media as its object, or the use of social media on the performance of SMEs.",

Organizational contexts include size, strategy, industry, market, business process objectives, and internal factors within the company. This principle is important since failure in implementing business process management in organizations is triggered by, one of which, the application of uniform business process management to all organizations and not paying attention to existing conditions [24] .
