The nature of an outbreak can range from infectious, zoonotic, or chronic diseases to injury, exposure to toxic substances, or healthdamaging behavior. The cause can be incidental, accidental, or intentional, as in the case of a bioterrorism attack. Outbreaks require public health investigators to respond quickly and to make reasonable judgments from a dynamically unfolding set of information. Speed, coordination, and informed judgment are critical in these situations, as problems that first appear limited may actually be significant outbreaks. A variety of approaches to outbreak detection and identification are possible, but the main points to keep in mind are described in the following section.",

Outbreaks are often related to the importation of a case from abroad that acts as a source case for an outbreak (Atkinson et al., 2007) .

One indicator to follow in the measles surveillance system, for example, is the median interval between onset of rash and notification to the public health authority. This indicator measures the time lost to contain the spread of the infection. This is shown by a measles outbreak that occurred in the United States after a 34-year-old minister with an undocumented history of vaccination became infected while traveling abroad (Rooney et al., 2004) . The first symptoms were noticed on 2 September 1999; the case was diagnosed on September 5 and the health department was informed on September 7.

            "text": "Another method of outbreak detection is through syndromic surveillance, which monitors nonspecific clinical syndromes. Once a possible outbreak is detected, a specific diagnosis is required to assess whether an outbreak has occurred. Since 1999, the New York City Department of Health has been monitoring and evaluating emergency medical service calls on a daily basis to identify an increase in respiratory illnesses that might represent an infectious disease outbreak . This is also the recommended method to detect possible intentional outbreaks due to bioterrorism (CDC, 2003) . Data sources used often already exist but have not been designed specifically for public health surveillance purposes. An example is the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which contains coded health information from physician visit records. Data abstracted from emergency department logs or 911 calls can also be used through analysis of text or other developed coding systems (Pavlin et al., 2003) . In the case of a chemical agent, unexplained deaths among young or healthy persons or emission of unexplained odors by patients could indicate an outbreak. Laboratory tests also play an important role. Cases are not always geographically clustered and for that reason are not always easily linked to an outbreak. The CDC and several state health departments established PulseNet, a molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance to facilitate the detection and investigation of foodborne outbreaks (Swaminathan et al., 2001) . Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of DNA from bacterial isolates are submitted to the national database and can help link apparently unrelated cases that are geographically dispersed. Though PulseNet can detect clusters of potentially related organisms, epidemiologic assessment is required to determine if the cluster contributes to an outbreak. PulseNet laboratories operate in public health departments in all 50 US states and several national health and agriculture agencies. Most foodborne outbreaks are related to a local contamination such as in a restaurant, but a significant number are due to a wide distribution of food contaminated at various points of production. An example is an Escherichia coli O157 outbreak in 1992 linked with contaminated hamburgers that made more than 500 persons sick in 4 days and caused the deaths of 4 children (CDC, 1993) . It took 39 days for the public health system to recognize it as an outbreak and another 10 days to investigate and institute a recall of the contaminated meat. PulseNet can now increase the sensitivity of outbreak detection in many instances. For example, in September 2006, state and CDC officials were able to detect and link multiple small clusters of E. coli O157:H7 infections across the United States within days using PulseNet information. This allowed investigators to rapidly identify fresh spinach as the source of infection (CDC, 2007b) . More than 200 cases were detected in 26 states and Canada ( Figure 4 ). ",

This core team should establish a hierarchy for decision and information sharing. They should then create objectives for the investigation and develop plans for reevaluating the objectives as the investigation evolves. It is important to delineate roles and responsibilities for the relevant agencies and to agree on a timeline for reevaluating those roles. A lead agency and principal investigator should be identified. In the case of a large, complex outbreak, the need for additional human resources also has to be discussed. A list of types of expertise (e.g., epidemiologic, laboratory, statistical, communications) is required and availability of experts should be made known so that any gaps in expertise can be filled.",

            "text": "An important aspect of preparing an outbreak investigation is the logistics involved in conducting laboratory or environmental testing. This includes not only collecting and testing the specimens, but also tracking and monitoring the shipments of specimens. Some of this responsibility falls within the laboratory domain, but field investigators may also have to undertake some of these functions. The first step is to develop specimen collection and shipping protocols. This includes information about the samples that have to be included, such as type, quantity, and timing vis-\u00e0-vis disease onset and treatment, but also the type of containers, transport media, and preservatives needed. The protocol must address information to be included on the labels, preshipping requirements, and instructions for shipping. The next step is to develop specimen processing and testing protocols for the receiving laboratories. These include not only the tests each laboratory will conduct but also how the results will be determined and interpreted and how and to whom the results will be released. If indicated, the materials and supplies such as collection kits, testing reagents, control specimens, labels, and shipping supplies are obtained and shipped to the outbreak location. Once the specimens are collected, it is important to label them well and track them. In October 2001, a bioterrorism-related anthrax outbreak in New York City occurred. For weeks the New York Bioterrorism Response Laboratory (BTRL) was overwhelmed by the increasing number of environmental samples. To deal with the situation, a laboratory bioterrorism command center was established, and protocols for sample intake, processing, reporting, security, testing, staffing, and quality control were developed (Heller et al., 2002) . The specimen load increased from 1 every 2-3 months to 2700 nasal swabs in 2 weeks and 3200 environmental specimens in 2 months. Staff increased from 2 to 75 persons and 6 tons of laboratory supplies were flown in from the CDC. Figure 5 shows the data flowchart adopted soon after the surge of isolates after the bioterrorism attack.",

All the children ate lunch provided by the schools and the disease was characterized by short incubation periods and short durations of illness. Based on prior investigations, a biotoxin or chemical agent was suspected. An environmental investigation identified three distributors who provided the schools with tortillas of different sizes and under various brand names but from one manufacturer. Several deficiencies at the plant were noted such as improper storage, use, and labeling of chemicals and food ingredients and additives, and food contact surfaces were not protected from environmental contamination. Samples were collected and analyzed. After the manufacturer was informed about the suspected cause of the outbreak, the recipe was changed and the amount of calcium propionate and potassium bromate used was lowered (Shaffzin et al., 2006) .",

Recalled apple juice grew E. coli O157:H7 with the same PFGE pattern as those from the case isolates. The magnitude and severity of this outbreak led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to propose two new regulations (Troxell, 2005) . First, all unpasteurized fruit and vegetable juices would have to carry a label stating, \"Warning: this product has not been pasteurized and therefore may contain harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness in children, elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems.\" The second regulation is the application of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles to fruit and vegetable juice processing (see Relevant Websites). A HACCP program is a systematic method of identifying key production steps in which contamination may occur and instituting specific monitoring and interventions, such as pasteurization, at those steps.",

In 1999, two cases of Plasmodium vivax in the United States among children without travel exposure to an endemic area were the cause of an epidemiologic, entomologic, and environmental outbreak investigation in Suffolk County, New York (CDC, 2000) . Surveillance data can indicate if there is an outbreak, but an increase in the number of reports of a certain disease can be due to several factors, including a random increase in the number of cases, a higher awareness of the disease, a new diagnostic tool, a misdiagnosis, or a change in reporting requirements or forms. For this reason it is important to collect preliminary demographic, geographic, and epidemiologic information to link the cases. When in doubt, one should treat the cases as an outbreak but avoid labeling them before possessing appropriate scientific evidence.",

This design better suits outbreaks in which a limited and identifiable number of people were exposed to the risk factor or where one risk factor can have different outcomes. A typical example is a foodrelated outbreak at an event with a known guest list such as a wedding. People attending the event are asked if they became ill (thus meeting the case definition) but also which dishes they ate.
