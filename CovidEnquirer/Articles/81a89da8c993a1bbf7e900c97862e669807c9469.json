Implementation of the Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment Management System (OHSEMS) has become a critical aspect in higher education. This study presents an overview of the evaluation of the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education laboratories. The implementation of the OHSEMS is to prevent occupational accidents in the laboratory. The study design is a semiquantitative descriptive study. The aim of the study is to evaluate the implementation of the OHSEMS in higher education institution laboratories by evaluating the percentages of OHSEMS compliance in higher education laboratories. Five aspects are evaluated: occupational health, safety, and environment (OHSE) policy and commitment, planning, implementation, evaluation, and management review. The result shows that the average compliance with the OHSE policy and commitment aspect is 59.4% and for the planning, implementation, evaluation, and management review, the average compliance percentage are 33.0%, 65.3%, 26.0%, and 0.0%, respectively.",

            "text": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has recorded several potential hazards in laboratories, including chemical, biological, physical, and safety hazards. 1 Laboratory activities, such as academic and research activities, expose laboratory employees to potential hazards and increase the risk of incidents. In 2013, a study by OSHA indicated that an academic laboratory is 11 times more dangerous than a laboratory in the industrial sector. 2 Fire and explosion incidents caused by the use of chemicals are among the incidents that may occur in academic laboratories. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board has recorded several fire and explosion cases in academic laboratories that resulted in serious injuries when performing experiments with methanol. One incident occurred on September 3, 2014 on October 20, 2014 in Raymound, Illinois, that injured three groups of students and one adult due to the fire caused by a methanol experiment. 3 The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has recorded that from 2000 to 2015, tens of students experienced burns due to the experiments they performed in the lab. 4 The NFPA also recorded several incidents, such as the one in 2006 where three students in Ohio were injured when the methanol they were using for an experiment exploded. Another incident happened in 2011, when four students in Minnesota were burnt by chemicals. 4 Other incidents that may occur in laboratory are caused by biological hazards. In 1976, Pike stated there were at least 173 deaths were caused by infection in laboratories. 5 A case from November 2003 was recorded in Singapore, when a microbiology post-graduate student became infected by a West Nile virus culture he was using, which was also contaminated by the SARS corona virus. 5 Occupational accidents have occurred in universities in Indonesia, namely, laboratory (2015) and fire (2017) incidents. Those incidents created substantial negative effects, including negative financial negative effects because of damages to facilities, health effects in the form of morbidity (i.e., starting from mild to serious and even death), environmental effects (i. e., pollution), and degrading the image of the university. 6-12 Therefore, to prevent incidents in laboratories, formulating and implementing a management system that manages risks to prevent or minimize incidents is necessary. The management system that manages risk in laboratories in the field of occupational health, prevention of occupational diseases, and protection of environment is called the Laboratory Occupational Health, Safety, and Environment Management System, or laboratory OHSEMS. Laboratory OHSEMS involves all elements, including the management, staff, students, and work environment, that are integrated to achieve a laboratory that is a safe, efficient, and productive learning facility. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Higher education institutions have a commitment to implement the aspect of occupational health, safety, and environment (OHSE) in all activities. To support this commitment, higher education institutions have guidelines and manuals regarding safety applicable to the activities performed in its vicinity. One set of safety guidelines outlines laboratory safety to decrease or prevent incidents in the laboratory.",

CONCLUSION The OHSEMS has been implemented in all laboratories in this higher education institution. As many as 15 laboratories (17%) have complied with more than 70% of the OHSEMS standards, and 35 laboratories (39%) have complied with 50%-70% of the standards.
