However, there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem. Here, we present a model that formally integrates both the energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce. Our implementation, PETfold, was tested on a set of 46 well-curated Rfam families and its performance compared favorably to that of Pfold and RNAalifold.",

Since the structure of RNA is evolutionarily more conserved than its sequence, predicting the RNA's secondary structure is one of the most important steps towards its functional analysis. There are two fundamentally different approaches to predicting RNA secondary structures, namely free-energy minimization and probabilistic approaches, which often use phylogenetic information given by a multiple sequence alignment. This duality of approaches represents two different types of RNA structure information, the former relies on the physical properties of single sequences, while the latter uses evolutionary information in the form of compensatory base pair substitutions.",

On the other hand, it is known that methods such as RNAfold (1) and Mfold (2) achieve an overall sensitivity of about 70% (3). For example, H/ACA snoRNAs usually do not produce the characteristic two-stem when the energy minimization alone is used to determine the structure. Instead, information on the functional sites have to be used as additional constraints to the thermodynamic folding (4) (5) (6) . In general, there are several reasons for the inaccuracy of energy minimization. First, the energy model is incomplete, especially for multi-loop structures. Second, there can be alternative structures with similar free energies. And third, true structures are often stabilized by bound molecules. The only feasible way to determine the effects of these inaccuracies is to include phylogenetic information by looking for conserved substructures that cannot be accounted for by thermodynamic folding alone.",

While, this is a kind of gold standard for comparative RNA secondary structure prediction, the 'algorithm requires extreme amounts of memory and time' (8) . Thus, practical implementations of the Sankoff algorithm like FOLDALIGN (9-12), Dynalign (13, 14) , PMcomp (15) , LocARNA (16, 17) and PARTS (18) , published more than 20 years later, introduce different constraints and somewhat arbitrary choices in their scoring schemes to make the approach tractable for realistic input sizes.",

A mixed approach is employed by CMfinder (21) that implicitly combines energy contributions with an SCFG. As a seed CMfinder uses energetically folded structures from which a covariance model (SCFG) is constructed in successive rounds of optimization. Another approach is SimulFold (22) , which simultaneously infers structures (including pseudoknots), alignments and trees.

It has been shown that the quality of the predictions breaks down in cases where sequence identity is <60% (26) .

As mentioned in the Introduction section, these substructures cannot be accounted for in thermodynamic folding algorithms.

A substructure is a structure that fixes only some of the positions in a sequence, hence being a partial structure. A partial structure p is a tuple \u00f0B; S\u00de consisting of a set of base pairs B and a set of single-stranded positions S such that no single-stranded position in S is part of a base pair in B. Then, a partial structure p is a substructure of a structure if B and S sg\u00f0\u00de. The reliably conserved substructure rel is a substructure of that is determined by the evolutionarily highly reliable positions. They are selected by using thresholds on the reliability scores of single-stranded (p threshold ss ) and base-paired positions (p threshold bp ). We get rel by using a Nussinov-style approach with the additional condition that There are two possible approaches to determine these thresholds. First, they can be estimated through parameter tuning using a data set of known RNA families to predict RNA structures most similar to their structure annotations (see Result section).

Highly conserved RNA structures are probably naturally selected due to their functional relevance, while less conserved sequences tend to fold in a state of minimum free energy. Combining both types of information increases the predictive power: we rely on phylogenetic information if the structure elements are highly conserved and extend the model by including folding energies to build the surrounding structure. The 46 Rfam seed alignments used for benchmarking are selected for their consistency. They might include manually optimized structure information, that are not achieved by sequence alignment algorithms. However, we are interested in the best possible structure prediction, which is often only found using conserved structure information in the alignment. The analyses of PETfold revealed that the selection of a reliably conserved substructure rel is less important than expected. This has been confirmed by estimating the statistical significance of the reliability scores, which shows that only high-reliability scores are significant. On the other hand, the combination of an evolutionary model with a thermodynamic model outperforms the widely used RNA structure predictors Pfold and RNAalifold.",

However, we observed a correlation to the number of structural clusters in an alignment as measured by Pcluster. This should be investigated in greater detail since it provides a new possibility to classify multiple RNA alignments. Currently, the measurements as used, e.g. in BRAliBase (26) are MPI and SCI.",

In contrast, PETfold provides accurate structure predictions for four viral RNA families [HepC_CRE (49), IBV_D-RNA (50), TCV_H5 (51) and TCV_Pr (51)]. Their alignments contain between 3 and 64 sequences and have mean pairwise identities (MPI) ranging from 77% to 95%, showing that PETfold is not overfitted to certain alignment features. Furthermore, a scan of all 574 seed alignments in Rfam version 8.0 results in the best performance by PETfold (MCC \u00bc 0:63), followed by Pfold (MCC \u00bc 0:62) and RNAalifold (MCC \u00bc 0:58). However, it should be noted that a large number of annotated RNA structures in Rfam are themselves predictions, many by Pfold. The performance of PETfold increases greatly in the case of several H/ACA snoRNAs, the already mentioned example of ncRNAs that often do not fold into the structure of lowest free energy, e.g. HACA_sno_snake (52) (MCC with PETfold: 0.79, Pfold: 0.25, RNAalifold: 0.41) as a member of our data set and SNORA51 (53) (MCC with PETfold: 0.91, Pfold: 0.13, RNAalifold: 0.57).
