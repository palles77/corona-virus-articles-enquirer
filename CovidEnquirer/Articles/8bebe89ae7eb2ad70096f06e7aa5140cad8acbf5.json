Using the MM5/CALMET model simulated wind data of Hong Kong, the FAD map of three urban zones are calculated: podium (0-15 m), building (15-60 m), and urban canopy (0-60 m). The wind tunnel test data is used to correlate the FAD understanding of the three zones. The grid sensitivity test indicates that 200 m \u00d7 200 m is the reasonable resolution for the FAD map; the test also establishes that the lower urban podium zone yields the best correlation with the experimental data. The study further establishes that the simpler two-dimensional ground coverage ratio (GCR), which is readily available in the planning circle, can be used to predict the area's average pedestrian level urban ventilation performance of the city. Working with their inhouse GIS team using available data, it allows the planners a way to understand the urban ventilation of the city for decisions related to air paths, urban permeability and site porosity.",

Hong Kong has a hilly topography; hence, only 25% of the land is built-up areas (Ng, 2009) . Land prices in Hong Kong have been increasing over the years. For example, in the Central Business District, rent prices has increased 33% between (HKRVD, 2009 ). Owing to the limited land area and the increasing land prices, property developers are building taller and bulkier buildings with higher building plot ratios that occupy the entire site area in order to economically cope with the high land costs (Fig. 1 ). In addition, the Government of Hong Kong has the planned need to deal with an increasing population, which is projected to increase to 10 million in the next 30 years. Seeking ways to optimize the urban morphology of the city is a difficult and important task for urban planners.",

Stagnant air in urban areas has caused, among other issues, outdoor urban thermal comfort problems during the hot and humid summer months in Hong Kong. Stagnant air has also worsened urban air pollution by restricting dispersion in street canyon with high building-heightto-street-width ratios. The Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has reported frequent occurrence of high concentrations of pollutants, such as NO 2 and respirable particles (RSP) in urban areas like Mong Kok and Causeway Bay (Yim et al., 2009 ).

The importance of the wind environment on the physical interaction between urban areas and the atmosphere has been studied by urban climate researchers (Arnfield, 2003) . Two kinds of tools are frequently employed to study the wind environment of the city: wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tech-niques. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted numerous urban-scale wind tunnel tests to understand the dispersion of particulate matters smaller than 10 m in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10 ) (Ranade et al., 1990) . Williams and Wardlaw (1992) conducted a large-scale wind tunnel study to describe the pedestrian-level wind environment in the city of Ottawa, Canada. The study identified areas of concern for planners. Plate (1999) developed the boundary layer wind tunnel studies to analyze urban atmospheric conditions, including wind forces on buildings, pedestrian comfort, and diffusion processes from point-sources of the city. Kastner-Klein et al. (2001) analyzed the interaction between wind turbulence and the effects induced by vehicles moving inside the urban canopy. Wind velocity and turbulence scales throughout the street canyons of the city were analyzed using smoke visualization (Perry et al., 2004) . In 2004, the US EPA's Office of Research and Development (EPA-ORD) conducted a city-scale wind tunnel study to analyze the airflow and pollutant dispersion in the Manhattan area (Perry et al., 2004) . Kubota et al. (2008) conducted wind tunnel tests and revealed the relationship between plan area fraction ( P ) and the mean wind-velocity ratio at the pedestrian level in residential neighborhoods of major Japan cities. In Hong Kong, the Wind/Wave Tunnel Facility has conducted numerous tests at the city, district, and urban scale to understand the wind availability and flow characteristics of Hong Kong (HKPD, 2008) .",

(1997) conducted a CFD study to analyze the meso-scale climate in the Greater Tokyo area. Murakami et al. (1999) used CFD simulations to analyze the wind environment at the urban scale. Kondo et al. (2006) used CFD simulations to analyze the diffusion of NO x at the most polluted roadside areas around the Ikegami-Shinmachi crossroads in Japan. Letzel et al. (2008) conducted studies of urban turbulence characteristics using the urban version of the parallelized Large-eddy Simulation (LES) model (PALM) which is superior to the conventional Reynolds-averaged models (RANS). Using the Earth Simulator, Ashie et al. (2009) conducted the largest urban CFD simulation of Tokyo to understand the effects of building blocks on the thermal environment of Tokyo. Ashie noted that the air temperatures around Ginza and JR Shimbashi are much higher than in the surrounding areas of Hama Park and Sumida River. Ashie argued that the high air temperature can be attributed to the bulky buildings at Ginza and JR Shimbashi that obstruct the incoming sea breezes (Ashie et al., 2009) . Yim et al. (2009) used CFD simulation to investigate the air pollution dispersion in a typical Hong Kong urban morphology. In general, using CFD for urban-scale investigation has been gaining momentum in the scientific circle. Recently, two important documents that provide guidelines for CFD usage have been published: AIJ Guidebook (AIJ, 2007; Tominaga et al., 2008) and COST action C14 (Frank, 2006) .",

However, using CFD model simulations and wind tunnel tests in urban planning is expensive. In addition, the CFD model simulations and wind tunnel tests may not be able to keep up with the fast design process in the initial stages of the design and planning decision making process, wherein outlined and district-based information based on urban morphological data parametrically understood can be more useful for planners. This paper employs the understanding of urban surface roughness based on the urban structure to establish the relationship between urban morphology and urban air ventilation environment. A new with cross section method is used to calculate the frontal area density (FAD). The terrain in Hong Kong is complicated; hence, the new method also takes into account the site-specific wind rose information at a height of 60 m obtained using the MM5/CALMET model simulation. Using the site-specific wind rose information, the FAD calculation focuses on the effects of the built environment to the wind field. The FAD calculation provides a district-based area average understanding of the wind permeability of the urban area at the urban scale.",

The total drag on a roughness surface includes both a pressure drag ( tp ) on the roughness elements and a skin drag ( ts ) on the underlying surface (Shao and Yang, 2005) . In this study, only the pressure drag is considered. This is because the skin drag is relatively small and is not a factor that can be controlled at the urban scale. Oke (1987) provided the logarithmic wind profile in a thermally neutral atmosphere, which is a semi-empirical relationship that acts as a function of two aerodynamic characteristics: roughness length (z0) and the zero-plane displacement height (zd). For setting a base for this logarithmic wind profile that recognized the irregular flow caused by physical bulk in the urban canopy, a new \"ground surface\" is set (Oke, 2006) . As shown in Fig. 2 , the height of the new surface is z0 + zd (Oke, 2006) . The reliable evaluation of such aerodynamic characteristics of urban areas is significant in depicting and predicting urban wind behaviors (Grimmond and Oke, 1999) .",

Compared with the micrometeorological method, the morphometric method estimates the aerodynamic characteristics, such as z0 and zd, using empirical equations (Kutzbach, 1961; Lettau, 1969; Raupach, 1992; Bottema, 1996; MacDonald et al., 1998) . Grimmond and Oke (1999) validated the empirical models by Kutzbach, Lettau, Raupach, Bottema and Macdonald. Reasonable relationships between z0 and frontal area index ( f(\u00c2) ) for low and medium density forms have been found; however, there is a tendency of overestimation of z0 for higher density cases (Bottema, 1996) . Grimmond and Oke (1999) calculated f(\u00c2) in the context of the urban morphology of North America cities. Ratti et al. (2002) calculated f(\u00c2) of 36 wind directions in London, Toulouse, Berlin, and Salt Lake City. By incorporating a spatially continuous database on aerodynamic and morphometric characteristics, such as f(\u00c2) , z0 and zd, morphometric estimation methods can be helpful to urban planners and researchers in depicting the distribution of the roughness of the city. Using Bottema's model equation, G\u00e1l and Unger (2009) drew a roughness map of z0 and zd to detect the ventilation paths in Szeged. Wong et al. (2010) drew a map of f(\u00c2) to detect the air paths in the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong.",

Due to the complex topography of Hong Kong and hence the differences in wind roses in different areas, the territory of Hong Kong is divided into sub-areas based on the urban characteristics and the positions of the urban areas for the FAD calculation (Fig. 6) .

Similarly, due to the urban morphology of Hong Kong, which is characterized by high density and tall buildings, the airflow above the top of the urban canopy layer may not easily enter into the deep street canyons to benefit the wind environment at the pedestrian level. Thus, the wind velocity ratio at the pedestrian level is mostly dependent on the wind permeability of the podium layer. A statistical study was conducted to validate the above assumption. This was accomplished by comparing the sensitivities of VR w,j to changes of f(z) calculated at different height bands. The results of the validation are plotted in Fig. 12 . The values of R 2 in different height bands ( Fig. 12a and b) confirm that VR w,j has a higher correlation with f(z) at the podium layer (0-15 m). This illustrates that the wind velocity ratio at the pedestrian level is more dependent on the urban morphology at the podium layer (0-15 m) than the building layer (15-60 m) or the whole canopy layer (0-60 m).",
