Here we designed a dynamic transmission model to analyze the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea based on confirmed cases reported during the period May 20-July 4, 2015. Our model explicitly incorporates superspreading events and time-dependent transmission and isolation rates. Our model was able to provide a good fit to the trajectory of the outbreak and was useful to analyze the role of hypothetical control scenarios. Specifically, we assessed the impact of the timing of control measures, especially associated with a reduction of the transmission rate and diagnostic delays on outbreak size and duration. Early interventions within 1 week after the epidemic onset, for instance, including the initial government announcement to the public about the list of hospitals exposed to MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), show a promising means to reduce the size (>71%) and duration (>35%) of the MERS epidemic. Finally, we also present results of an uncertainty analysis focused on the role of superspreading events.",

Although countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America have experienced sporadic importations of MERS from the Middle East, these have not generated local outbreaks thus far. The largest MERS outbreak outside Saudi Arabia occurred in the Republic of Korea as a result of a single importation from the Arabian Peninsula in May 2015.

            "text": "The potential for high variability in the number of secondary cases or superspreading events (SSEs) is a notable characteristic of infectious diseases (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Galvani and May, 2005) . Cases that generate a disproportionate number of secondary cases tend to occur during the early stage of an epidemic (Transmission Dynamics and Control of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2003; . Conversely, unlike \"superspreaders\", the typical individuals tend to infect only a few or no cases at all. In recent works on the MERS outbreak Nishiura et al., 2015; Kucharski and Althaus, 2015; Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013) , this individual variation has been described by transmission heterogeneity. Based on the stochastic approach, it is assumed that the number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual is negative binomial distributed with mean 0 and dispersion parameter k (with lower value representing higher heterogeneity, and vice versa). In this framework, SSEs during the recent MERS outbreaks can be explained by the high dispersion nature of the distribution of the number of secondary cases per case. For example, Chowell et al. (2015) estimated that the mean 0 for the MERS outbreaks was below the epidemic threshold value of 1 while the dispersion parameter k was estimated at 0.06, indicating high heterogeneity in the potential number of secondary cases. Simulations indicated that the probability of observing outbreaks larger than the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea is only of the order of 1%. However, this requires careful interpretation because SSEs during outbreaks might be treated as outliers rather than observations stemming from a highly over dispersed distribution. At the same time, infectious diseases with subcritical 0 and overdispersed k are more likely to subside within just a few disease generations.",

In this work, we develop a mathematical model that is consistent with consolidated retrospective investigations of previous MERS outbreaks.

Empirical evidence indicates that behavioral changes could make the nosocomial transmissibility decrease significantly (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004) . Additionally, the government allowed the diagnostic testing for MERS to be performed at authorized health facilities in order to shorten the duration of diagnosis (Cho and Chu, 2015) . The median value of duration from symptom onset to laboratory confirmation was significantly shortened after June 7 (from 6 days to 2 days).

For example, the list of hospitals that were exposed to MERS patients was announced to the public on June 7. Cho and Chu (2015) After that, people changed their behaviors such as avoiding visiting hospitals, wearing an N95 mask, and using hand sanitizers. At that time, the health authorities expanded the screening capacity for rapid diagnosis.

Such interventions could prevent the occurrence of SSEs because the potential superspreaders were immediately isolated after being confirmed with MERS infection.",

Moreover, the estimated e after the control measures were implemented was substantially decreased. This indicates that the MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea had a low transmissibility in the absence of the SSEs (Cowling et al., 2015) . However, the reasons for the emergence of the biggest outbreak outside the Middle East are attributed to the importation of the virus without awareness of the public health , missed contacts (Cho and Chu, 2015) , substantial exposure to infection (\u03b4t 2 ) caused by delayed diagnosis and isolation , and abnormally high contact rate of the superspreaders ( \u03b2 * i ) in the crowded hospital setting (Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015) . Of 186 confirmed cases with MERS-CoV infection in the Republic of Korea, 153 cases (82.3%) were generated by only 5 cases (2.7%). Conversely, this transmission heterogeneity suggests that identifying them in their suspected stage of MERS-CoV infection could stem the subsequent transmission in over 150 cases in the host population (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Galvani and May, 2005; Stein, 2011) .",

Quarantine and isolation turned out to be highly effective control measures for reducing the transmission rate. Our results show that the intervention strategies in the early stage of the outbreak (\u03c4 \u2264 7) could prevent the occurrence of SSEs and substantially reduce the outbreak duration and size. In other words, the failure of rapid detection and proper isolation of suspected patients early in the outbreak has contributed to SSEs, which is in line with the experience of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 (Galvani and May, 2005; McDonald et al., 2004) . Our results derived from the uncertainty analysis of the SSEs suggest that the recent MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea could have been smaller in size and duration. When \u03c4 = 11, it is very likely that outbreaks with both SSE 1 and SSE 2 have a shorter duration and a smaller size (with mean 58 days and 158 cases, respectively) compared to the baseline outcome.",

Case 14 and Case 16 were not classified as suspected cases but should have been home-quarantined as soon as they were exposed to MERS-CoV by the index case. Furthermore, the diagnostic delay in nosocomial infection made them become superspreaders. After the health authorities implemented the strong control measures such as contact tracing using CCTV surveillance and the GPS of mobile phones, the confirmed cases who were not identified in the contact tracing gradually decreased since June 12 (Cho and Chu, 2015) . Our results suggest the importance of the early implementation of such interventions in the rapid containment of the SSEs and, consequently, in the remarkable reduction in outbreak duration and size.",
