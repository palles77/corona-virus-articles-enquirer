Extrapolation of their use for infectious diagnostics and detection of biodefense related agents provides an attractive alternative to conventional analytical approaches. Hence the critical need for advanced diagnostic systems in microbiology is to detect rapidly genetic information within the known and unanticipated pathogenic microrganisms associated with the human health (i.e. viruses, bacteria and fungi). With the parallelism offered by DNA microarray technology we are able to pursue and develop an approach to large-scale analyses of such abundance of genetic information in these organisms. The main technical challenge in this field arises from the difficulty in labeling sufficient copies of pathogenic biomarkers. However, when integrated in one portable diagnostic device labelfree detection has great potential for addressing this neckbottle and speeds up practical application of microarray technology.",

(13) have used some TaqMan probes labeled with different fluorophores to detect simultaneously seven various DNA targets. Tong et al. (14) have also described a combinatorial design of distinct fluorescence emission signatures for higher throughput assays. Also, several groups have immobilized molecular beacons on a solid surface to construct a molecular beacon array to resolve the target DNA sequences spatially (15) (16) (17) (18) . These pioneering works provide a new opportunity in quantitative, label-free and high-throughout detection of nucleic acid analysis. However, a high fluorescent background because of incomplete quenching of the molecular beacons and the interfacial effect induced by the electrostatic properties at the solid-liquid interface, greatly decreases the signal-to-background ratio. Previously, our research group had fabricated molecular beacon arrays on an agarose film to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms of unlabeled PCR products. Because of a solution-like hybridization environment and high binding capacity provided by the agarose film, an improved signalto-background ratio for single nucleotide mismatch were observed (19) . But this approach is not suitable for realtime monitoring of the PCR and hybridization process since the agarose film is not capable of withstanding high temperature during PCR. Therefore, we need more robust microarray technology to resolve this problem.",

Owing to these chemical properties such probes can not be directly used in the immobilizaton on a glass slide because the reporter dyes of these probes are cleaved and released into the solution during the PCR. In this paper, we report firstly a set of innovative aminomodified TaqMan probes immobilized on a glass slide to form a regular array pattern for quantitative nucleic acid detection. The structure of this unique TaqMan probe consists of an amino group at the 3 0 end for immobilization, poly(T) 20 as a linker arm, 6-FAM-labeled phosphoramidite at the middle as the reporter dye and a dabcyl group at 5 0 end as the quencher. In contrast with conventional TaqMan probe where the fluorophore is located at 5 0 end of the probe, our 3 0 amino-modified TaqMan probe is designed to have a quencher located at the 5 0 end of the probe so that the quencher can be cleaved and the fluorescent signal on the array can be restored during the PCR. These features ensure that the TaqMan probes can be used to quantify nucleic acid targets on a solid-liquid surface. We used this approach to demonstrate the feasibility of real-time nucleic acid analysis in parallelism directly from genomic DNA, e.g. from a mip gene of Legionella pneumophila (DNA1), from a hexon gene of human adenovirus (DNA2), from a rfbE gene of Escherichia coli O157:H7 (DNA3), as negative control one from a non-related human ESR1 gene (DNA4), and lastly from a specific nucleic acid fragment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (DNA5). We also investigated the specificity, sensitivity and cleavage dynamics of TaqMan probes immobilized on a glutaraldehyde-modified glass slide. Like the cleavage in solution, we find the cleavage of the quencher dye occurs on the array and causes an increase in reporter fluorescence intensity because the reporter is no longer quenched. TaqMan probe arrays have a great potential to provide a fresh and attractive scheme that has the ability to high-throughput, real-time quantitative detection of the unlabeled DNA targets.",

When the reporter dye is excited by irradiation, its fluorescent emission will be quenched through the process of fluorescence energy transfer. During the annealing/extension step of PCR amplification, the probe will be recognized by DNA polymerase so that the cleavage will occur between the reporter and the quencher dyes by 5 0 -3 0 nuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase. Then the reporter dye is no longer quenched and the increase in reporter fluorescence intensity will be observed. In this process, a surface immobilized TaqMan probes was designed and synthesized with an amino group at the 3 0 end, fluorescein-dT at the middle as the reporter dye and Dybcyl at the 5 0 end as a quencher. A CPG with Fmoc protected amino group and Ultra-Mild CE phosphoramidites were used for synthesis. The Fmoc group is quite stable and base liable. After detritylation in 3% dichloroacetic acid (DCA)/dichloromethane (DCM), the monomethoxytritylamino (MMT) was removed from 5 0 end amino group, which was then used to couple with Dabcyl-NHS ester on the CPG while the 3 0 end amino group was still protected by Fmoc. After removal of Fmoc amino protection and cleavage, the probes were released from the CPG and 3 0 end amino group was used for immobilization. The 20 base T was used as a linker to minimize the space hindrance for enzyme cleavage. When the 5 0 -3 0 nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase cleave the 5 0 dabcyl molecule into solutions during PCR on slides, the FAM reporter dye at 3 0 end is still bound to the solid surface by covalent bond. Then the fluorescence increment of the FAM dye on the specific array can be directly acquired by a scanner. Dabcyl is non-fluorescent and can quench FAM dye well. Furthermore, dabcyl is compatible with the amino group and economical in the probes synthetic process. In addition, a 20 base thymine spacer is used to minimize destabilization caused by 3 0 end immobilization.",

The 3 0 amino-modified TaqMan probes and the corresponding primer pairs are summarized in Table 1 . We used the laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP) to acquire the experiment data and to produce the scanned images at stable speed. Under the certain objective (10\u00b7) and eye lens (10\u00b7), the image size of the scanning field area is 1 mm \u00b7 1 mm. The area of the probe array of 3 \u00b7 5 almost covers the size of the scanning field area. Of course, we can assemble a series of different frames of the collected images together if you want to expand the scanning area for immobilizing more probes. The physical distance between the reporter and quencher are extremely important in the design of this type of fluorogenic probe. According to the previous studies, the melting temperature (T m ) value and the distance of the two dyes of the conventional TaqMan probe, and amplion length are all critical factors in a successful real-time PCR. For example, a conventional probe system will provide an appropriate ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the reporter dye over the quencher dye, typically both in solution at 60-67 C of T m and 75-150 bp of amplion length (8, 21) . If too large physical distance between the two dyes in solution will directly result in low quench efficiency. We choose 20-24 bases between the two dyes in all the aminomodified TaqMan probes (TM1-TM5) and their amplion sizes are no more than 250 bp. Increasing the length of amplicons may result in a longer annealing/polymerization step or a higher Mg 2+ concentration, which decreases the specificity of the PCR. It might also make the system less efficient and inflexible.",

When PCR mixtures including a template DNA1 are added, DNA1 and its complementary probe TM1 form a rigid probe-target duplex (Figure 1b) . Then Taq DNA polymerase will recognize this hybrid and cleave the quencher of TM1 because of its inherent 5 0 nuclease activity. The quencher of TM1 is released into solution and the reporter dye at 3 0 end is still bound on surface so that the fluorescence of TM1 is restored, while TM2 is still quenched (Figure 1c) .

The consecutive real-time PCR provide well-shaped curves of the increase in fluorescence intensity of the amino-modified TaqMan probe for the specific hexon gene over this broad dynamic detection range (Figure 2) . From left to right, the curves denoted the 1.2 \u00b7 10 7 , 1.2 \u00b7 10 6 , 1.2 \u00b7 10 5 , 1.2 \u00b7 10 4 , 1.2 \u00b7 10 3 , 1.2 \u00b7 10 2 and 1.2 \u00b7 10 1 copies, respectively. The fluorescence signal increase above the instrument threshold during PCR for the specific fragment occurred at distinct cycles. High fluorescence intensities and well-shaped standard curves with relatively identical distances for the serial dilutions led to clear and interpretable results (shown in Figure 2 inset). The results suggest that 5 0 end of the dabcyl quencher and 3 0 end of the FAM reporter in our aminomodified TaqMan probes can be used in quantitative analysis of nucleic acid targets in solutions. Table 1 . The sequences of primers and TaqMan probes used in this study Figure 3 shows the specificity of detecting unlabeled nucleic acid targets by a 5 0 nuclease PCR assay using the aminomodified TaqMan probe glass array.

The fluorescence images were collected by a confocal fluorescence microscope (Materials and Methods). We then found that the fluorescence intensities of various amino-modified TaqMan probes are different and that the fluorescence intensity increments of the different DNA template are clearly located at corresponding sites. The results indicate the high specificity of the 5 0 nuclease PCR using the amnio-modified TaqMan probes arrayed on surface and demonstrate how our TaqMan probe arrays can successfully detect the presence of specific gene fragments.",

A mixture of PCR described in Materials and Methods containing 1 ng DNA2 template was injected into a chamber sealed by the gene-frame and amplified. The reaction condition is also same as described above except that the PCR cycle numbers are different. To evaluate the dynamic changes of fluorescence intensities, we acquired serial fluorescence images at various cycle numbers i.e. 1, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35 and 38 (shown in Figure 4A ). The scatter diagram in Figure 4B plots the fluorescence signal data versus PCR cycle number. This result with a slightly diminished signalbackground-ratio is similar to that reported above in solutions. There are two possible interpretation of the signalbackground-ratio reduction for the immobilized TaqMan probe arrays. First, the interfacial effect makes their inherent structure different from that in the solution. This structure change influences negatively on quenching efficiency and increases their fluorescence backgrounds on solid-liquid surfaces. Second, the steric effects caused by high immobilization densities decrease the rate of the duplex formation of the immobilized probe and DNA target, which might also decrease the cleavage efficiency. Therefore, the T m value of the amino-modified TaqMan probe should be set about 10 C higher than that of the primer. This ensure that each TaqMan probe is coupled with a DNA target via base pairing before the forward and inverse primers are attached, and that the free 5 0 end of the immobilized TaqMan probe is accessible for nuclease activity by DNA polymerase. This also ensures that the large amount of the probes participates in the cleavage process and it is easier to get the high signal-background-ratio. ",

After the amplification, each image of different concentration DNA targets was collected. In these images, the TaqMan probes were spotted on the slides in triplet format. From top to bottom, the probes are TM5, TM4, TM3, TM1 and TM2, respectively. Figure 5 showed the fluorescence intensity changes of the amino-modified TaqMan probe (TM2) on the surface with a broad range of 1.2 \u00b7 10 7 to 1.2 \u00b7 10 1 target DNA copies of the hexon gene. The results indicate that the amino-modified TaqMan probe array has good sensitivity.",

The two different DNA targets, the 193 base synthesized oligomer (with an A/G wild type/mutation type mismatch at position 37) and the wild type of the hexon gene fragment, were applied to the amplification on a TaqMan probe array. During the amplification corresponding images at different annealing temperatures were collected at 50, 52, 54, 56 and 58 C, respectively, and these are shown in Figure 6 . The fluorescence signals of the two targets on the TaqMan probe array are obviously different. Hence, the results clearly discriminate between a perfectly matched target and single nucleotide mismatched target.",

We have also immobilized successfully 3 0 amino-modified TaqMan probes to aldhyde-modified glass slides for quantitative PCRs in real-time by the poly(T) 20 thermocycling reaction using the covalent bond linkage. Finally, a TaqMan probe array on an aldhyde derived glass slide was fabricated and we investigated its specificity, its sensitivity and the dynamics change of fluorescence intensity at various PCR cycle numbers. This study presents a first experimental demonstration of direct real-time quantitative nucleic acid analysis from genomic DNA by 5 0 nuclease cleavage assays on a surface array format. In all previous studies of real-time PCR in solution, freely-diffusing TaqMan probes were used, which have limited parallel analysis capability. Our results indicate that TaqMan probe arrays have potentially a great advantage in real-time quantification of multiple unlabeled nucleic acid targets, which promises a great opportunity for clinical applications such as gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. In the future, advances in chemistry for instance in reporter and quencher dyes technology resulting in greater quench efficiency will even further improved the performance of our TaqMan probe arrays.
