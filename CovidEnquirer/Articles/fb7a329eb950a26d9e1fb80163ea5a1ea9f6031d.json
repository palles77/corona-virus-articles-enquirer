            "text": "The M protein of coronavirus plays a central role in virus assembly, turning cellular membranes into workshops where virus and host factors come together to make new virus particles. We investigated how M structure and organization is related to virus shape and size using cryo-electron microscopy, tomography and statistical analysis. We present evidence that suggests M can adopt two conformations and that membrane curvature is regulated by one M conformer. Elongated M protein is associated with rigidity, clusters of spikes and a relatively narrow range of membrane curvature. In contrast, compact M protein is associated with flexibility and low spike density. Analysis of several types of virus-like particles and virions revealed that S protein, N protein and genomic RNA each help to regulate virion size and variation, presumably through interactions with M. These findings provide insight into how M protein functions to promote virus assembly.",

            "text": "Every type of virus architecture has its own structural constraints. In other words, there is a limit to the variation in shape, size or protein configuration that can be realized by a particular set of structural proteins. When this tolerance is exceeded, the result becomes uncertain: it is possible that the assembly process may fail, produce misshapen but otherwise infectious particles, or yield non-infectious particles. Pleomorphic enveloped viruses represent the most extreme cases of natural variation during assembly. Pleomorphic virions can vary considerably in size, as in the case of arenaviruses (Neuman et al., 2005) or shape, as in the case of influenza A virus (Harris et al., 2006) . Although this variation has been documented, little is known about how the assembly components shape the overall particle architecture. Our understanding of virus assembly has practical implications: a new generation of HIV-1 assembly inhibitors acts at the level of particle architecture by reducing the fidelity of the assembly process (Tang et al., 2003) or by blocking connections between Gag proteins (Sticht et al., 2005) .",

Recent electron microscopy studies have confirmed that coronavirus particles vary considerably in size, and so can safely be described as pleomorphic. However, there is disagreement over the extent of variation in virion shape (Barcena et al., 2009; Beniac et al., 2006; Neuman et al., 2006; Risco et al., 1996) , although a range of morphologies is represented in each study. These three coronaviruses make an interesting dataset because each is built from a conserved set of components, but amino acid identity between the homologous structural proteins is typically less than 30%.",

Reverse genetic studies and VLP assembly studies suggest that M protein promotes assembly by interacting with viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and S glycoproteins at the budding site (de Haan et al., 1999; Escors et al., 2001a; Escors et al., 2001b; Kuo and Masters, 2002; Narayanan et al., 2000; Nguyen and Hogue, 1997; Opstelten et al., 1995; Sturman et al., 1980) , and by forming a network of M-M interactions that is capable of excluding some host membrane proteins from the viral envelope (de Haan et al., 2000; Neuman et al., 2008b) . M proteins interact through both the transmembrane domain and endodomain (de Haan et al., 2000) . M can also interact with RNA that carries the genomic packaging signal (Narayanan et al., 2003) . Coronavirus assembly is then completed at the membrane of a pre-Golgi compartment, as shown most recently in a tomography study of intracellular structures involved in virus replication and assembly (Knoops et al., 2008) . Packets of virions are then shuttled out of the cell along the secretory pathway (reviewed in (Hogue and Machamer, 2007) ). The minimum requirement for MHV virus-like particle (VLP) production is co-expression of M and E proteins (Vennema et al., 1996) , although in some expression systems, the additional co-expression of N increases the efficiency of VLP production (Boscarino et al., 2008) .",

First, we have used cryo-EM and tomography to probe the structure of M in the envelope of MHV, SARS-CoV and FCoV virions. Second, we have analyzed the structure of the MHV M protein in VLPs that lack S and RNP. This is because identification of M in electron micrographs of virions is complicated by the presence of transmembrane regions of spikes and RNP, and, more importantly, intermolecular interactions could potentially affect coronavirus morphology, including M-M, M-E, M-N, M-S, M-RNA and N-RNA interactions (reviewed in (Hogue and Machamer, 2007) ), palmitin-mediated interactions involving S and E (Boscarino et al., 2008; Lopez et al., 2008; Thorp et al., 2006) , and envelope stretching caused by the packaged helical ribonucleoprotein (Barcena et al., 2009 ). Together, these experiments reveal new facets of the structure and function of M, and demonstrate how pleomorphicity can be harnessed to reveal the function of membrane protein networks.",

A small plaque mutant derived from MHV-A59, called MHV-sp1, was isolated by plaque purification from the medium from persistently infected 17 clone 1 (17cl-1) cells that had survived infection with MHV-A59 and had been passaged more than 40 times (Sawicki, 1987) . The MHV-sp1 S glycoprotein is not cleaved at the S1-S2 boundary and it is resistant to cleavage by trypsin, unlike the S-glycoprotein of MHV-A59. MHV-sp1 was purified by centrifugation. First, the virus from 450 ml of infected cell supernatant ($5 \u00c2 10 11 pfu) was pelleted by centrifugation for 3 h at 24,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C using an SW28 rotor.

However, none of these studies produced a clear view of M, which is obscured in micrographs by the viral membrane, the C-termini of S proteins and the RNP. To better understand the structure and organization of M, we examined by cryo-EM ( Fig.1A -C) and cryoelectron tomography (Fig.1D ), coronavirus particles, vesicles, VLPs containing only M and E, and VLPs containing M, E and N proteins. In purified virus preparations we also found a small number of apparently protein-free empty vesicles, which presumably were released from infected cells, and which we refer to in this study as exosomes. Viruses and VLPs had thicker envelope regions than vesicles or exosomes due to the presence of M protein, as previously reported (Barcena et al., 2009; Neuman et al., 2006) . The purification process used for MHV-sp1 also produced some free, spike-decorated envelopes.

The ectodomain of M did not give rise to a detectable radial density signal, suggesting that it may either be disordered or tightly membrane-associated. An area of consistent, high density which extended from 10 to 30 nm inside the particle was attributed to RNP, consistent with recent measurements by Barcena et al. (2009) . Fig.2D shows that the variability in radial density was low from the virus exterior through the RNP feature, but innermost parts of the virion were highly variable.

The M endodomain density consisted of the tail region, extending 6 to 8 nm into the particle where the differences between M conformations were most apparent, and the denser body region, extending 3.5 to 5.5 nm into the particle. After subtracting the density of the ice outside the particle to correct for differences in background and scaling image brightness to a common mean, the ratio of M tail to middle was calculated for each virion or VLP. We found that the density in the ''tail'' region of M COMPACT was similar to the density of the background ice, and the peak M endodomain was higher than for M LONG . To express M conformation more simply, we subtracted the background from the tail and body densities and calculated tail to body ratios for M LONG and M COMPACT (Fig.3I) . We found that the difference in tail to body ratios was statistically significant (T-test, P = 0.014 for FCoV, P = 2.0 \u00c2 10 \u00c017 for SARS-CoV and P = 3.0 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 for MHV). This suggests that the two forms of M represent different conformations of the same peptide chain, and the distribution of density at the virion edge can be used as an approximate readout for M conformation.",

The endodomains of adjacent M LONG particles appeared to contact each other, suggesting that M LONG -M LONG interactions are mediated by the endodomain of M. M LONG on EM VLPs appeared similar to M on virions, thus confirming that M LONG is formed by M in the absence of the other high-copy virion proteins S and N (Fig.4B) . Some class averages of M LONG also showed a distinct tilt relative to the membrane. The endodomain of M LONG was resolved into two globular components with crisp borders between adjacent molecules, while the endodomain of M COMPACT appeared as an indistinct ellipsoid and extended only $6 nm (Fig.4A ). The two globular components of the endodomain were not distinctly observed in class averages from EM VLPs (Fig.4B) , suggesting that either the conformation is only formed in the presence of N or that N forms part of the two-lobed M LONG. M LONG and M COMPACT were also visible in virtual slices through tomographic reconstructions of MHV. The difference in apparent length was most evident on tomographic slices through free envelopes, which showed thick convex M LONG membranes near the center giving way to thinner variably curved M COMPACT membranes near the edges ( Fig.5A and B) .",

While axial class averages suggest that M packing generally approximates a rhombus with sides of 4.0 and 4.5 nm and an interior angle of about 75\u00b0, the amount of heterogeneity in the unprocessed images is more consistent with a loosely-ordered network of M, as opposed to a rigid two-dimensional protein lattice.

However, EMN VLPs were significantly rounder than the combined population of SUV 100 and endosomal vesicles (ANOVA, P = 0.005). Although EM particles were rounder on average than EMN particles or vesicles, the difference was not significant due to the small sample size and heterogeneity of the EM particles. This indicates that the protein component of EMN VLPs provides significant resistance to the deformative forces that affected vesicles under cryo-EM conditions. We next sought an explanation for how E, M and N proteins can make spherical vesicles more rigid. N proteins can dimerize (Chen et al., 2007) and pack helically in the presence (Barcena et al., 2009 ) and absence (Saikatendu et al., 2007) of RNA, but neither of these interactions alone would be expected to produce a spherical arrangement. E protein is small and not abundant enough in viral particles to be a convincing explanation for overall shape. In contrast, M is abundant, interacts with other M proteins and with membranes, which are approximately spherical. We therefore hypothesized that particle shape is controlled primarily through M.",

Overall particle shape did not change significantly as a result of acidification (ANOVA, P = 0.93). However, the relative proportion of particles which appeared to have at least one flattened edge increased significantly after acid-treatment (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0001; Fig.8A -C). In some flat-edged particles, the interior RNP appeared to have a crisp edge, which was more distant from the membrane than RNP in native particles and M had the blurred appearance characteristic of M COMPACT (Fig.8B ). Radial density plots and M tail to body ratios demonstrate that the altered M which was more frequently found at flat edges of acid-treated particles strongly resembled M COMPACT from native MHV particles ( Fig.8D and E).

We initially considered that the difference between M LONG and M COMPACT might be due to altered topology. The N-ecto/ C-ecto topology proposed for TGEV M involves part of the endodomain forming a fourth transmembrane span, with part of the C-terminus exposed on the virion surface. Since the pre-transmembrane region of M is much smaller than the post-transmembrane region, an upside-down topology should be visually distinctive. However, the endodomains of M LONG and M COMPACT were of similar size in class averages. Instead, we prefer an interpretation in which M COMPACT and M LONG are conformationally distinct homodimers of N-ecto/C-endo topology, and the difference in appearance is due to a conformational change that either stretches (M LONG ) or collapses (M COMPACT ) the structure of the endodomain.",

The coronavirus M dimer would appear to be functionally equivalent to the heterodimeric complex of the triple-spanning membrane proteins GP5 and M which is essential for assembly of Equine arteritis virus (Snijder et al., 2003) , a distantly related nidovirus.

Further examination revealed that spikeless particles were significantly larger than spike-decorated particles, demonstrating that spikelessness resulted from a defect in assembly, not by accidental shearing or fusion activation. This led to a closer examination of SARS-CoV particles with patchy spike decoration. Spike patches were most often found at the ends of elongated particles, where M LONG is common, suggesting that M LONG mediates spike incorporation. Fig.10A shows a conceptual model of an elongated SARS-CoV particle with spikes decorating both ends, where M LONG is plentiful. The association of small clusters of S with M LONG was unexpected, but we were unable to determine whether the missing spikes were not incorporated, or were present in an elongated disordered conformation, as would be expected after fusion activation. Another possible explanation for this phenomenon is that incorporated spikes stabilize M LONG .",

Each M dimer could potentially interact with a spike, but the closest packing that could be achieved in this model would be $14-15 nm apart, based on the bulk of each spike and the nearest available anchor point. To test the quality of this model, we counted the number of spikes on three-dimensional reconstructions of MHV particles. These particles showed an average of 74 spikes per particle, which gives an approximate inter-spike spacing of 17 nm. Our model predicts $90 spikes per particle. Low spike incorporation in areas of M COMPACT may explain some of the difference between predicted and actual spike count. The protein spacing model in Fig.10B and C shows an average spacing of 4-5 nm between M protein dimers. Using the M spacing data for each virus (Fig.6C) , this would give $1100 M 2 molecules per average SARS-CoV, MHV and FCoV particle. We are unable to directly count the number of M features per particle because of the resolution of the reconstructed tomograms. However, the ratio of M to N in purified coronavirus particles has been well studied, and provides an indirect way to test the validity of our proposed M 2 spacing. Estimated ratios of M to N protein in purified coronaviruses range from about 3M:1N (Cavanagh, 1983; Escors et al., 2001b) to 1M:1N (Hogue and Brian, 1986; Liu and Inglis, 1991) , giving 730-2200 N molecules per virion. That works out to one N protein per 14-40 nucleotides of the genome. By comparison, the nucleoproteins of rabies virus and vesicular stomatitis virus are of similar molecular weight to coronavirus N proteins, and have been demonstrated to bind nine nucleotides per nucleoprotein (Albertini et al., 2006; Green et al., 2006) . If, as suggested by Barcena et al. (2009) , M dimers are spaced 6.5 nm apart, results of 60-200 nt/N molecule are obtained.",
