Previous research has shown that reduced appetite is an adaptive response to disease and that force feeding further debilitates sick animals and increases the risk that animals succumb to infection. Murray and Murray (1979) reported some of the first evidence showing the detrimental effects of force feeding sick animals: mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes and force fed had 50% greater mortality compared with infected mice provided food ad libitum. Quigley et al. (2006) did not report the number of calves that were fed with the esophageal feeder, but the likelihood of force feeding was greater for the calves receiving the higher quantities of milk, due to both increased intakes and the longer milk-feeding period (41 vs. 28 d).",

This \"sickness behavior\" is not a sickness-induced debilitation, but rather a coping mechanism that enables the individual to better counteract the infection (Hart, 1988; Aubert, 1999) . From this perspective, force-feeding (rather than the access to milk per se) would undermine the calf's attempt to mount this adaptive response to infection (Johnson, 1998) and put the calf at increased risk of morbidity and mortality.",

            "text": "The study by Quigley et al. (2006) suffers from a number of other methodological problems. The quantity of milk replacer fed to the calves was increased abruptly, rather than gradually. As acknowledged by the authors (Quigley et al., 2006; p. 209 ), this abrupt change may itself have increased the risk of diarrhea. The diagnosis of illness in the calves was initially based on the occurrence of diarrhea. However, the fecal scoring system was a subjective 1 to 4 scale based solely on fecal consistency. Although this system has been widely used to evaluate diarrhea in limit-fed calves, the authors provide no evidence that this measure was repeatable or a valid indicator of any underlying pathology. This aspect is critical in the present study as calves consuming greater amounts of milk replacer were also consuming greater quantities of liquid; this increased intake of liquids likely decreased fecal consistency in a way that was not related to pathology. Thus, the fecal scores presented do not necessarily indicate a high incidence of illness. Furthermore, body temperatures were only measured in calves that showed high fecal scores rather than being done systematically for all calves. Thus, the method of detecting fever was likely biased towards calves fed greater amounts of milk replacer. Finally, there was no mention of blinding of the observers to the treatment group of the calves, which is an additional important potential source of bias in the results.",
