The occurrence of eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction of the two related sequences allow the conservation of their tertiary structures in spite of the sequence divergence. The results support the possible control Introduction It has been demonstrated that pseudoknots are significant structural motifs that are found in ribosomal RNAs [4] , mRNA leader sequences [5] , and viral RNAs [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , especially in plant viral tRNAlike structures [12] . Although the precise threedimensional conformation of the pseudoknot remains uncertain, it can be considered to form a long quasi-continuous coaxial stacking region [12, 13] . This possible coaxial stacking region was suggested to be a common feature in the structure of a number of plant viral RNA 3' termini [14] . Pseudoknots have been implicated in several biological phenomena involving the replication of the plus strand of plant viruses [14] , interaction between proteins and RNA [15, 16] , and efficient ribosomal frameshifting [1] . Among them, the site-specific mutagenesis approach within the frameshift region of the genomic RNA of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has revealed that the RNA pseudoknot just downstream of the frameshift site is an essential element of the IBV ribosomal frameshifting signal [1] .",

            "text": "Retroviral ribosomal frameshifting involving ribosomal slippage into a -1 reading frame in gagpol (or gag-pro-pol) overlapping domains is commonly used in the native retroviral translational system. This translation mechanism clearly benefits retroviruses in that one kind of mRNA molecule can direct large amounts of structural (gag) protein synthesis and relatively small amounts of catalytic (pro and pol) protein synthesis, while the attached gag components can direct incorporation of pol products into viral cores. The basis of such translation control has been proposed [2, 3, [17] [18] [19] . Current studies have demonstrated that a \"slippery\" sequence at the ribosomal frameshift site and a stem-loop structure just downstream from it are essential for the frameshifting of several retroviruses. More recently, we have analyzed RNA secondary structures [20] that are predicted in the gag-pol or gag-pro and pro-pol junction regions (600 nucleotides) of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), bovine leukemia virus (BLV), human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-2), and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) by a recently developed Monte Carlo simulation method [21, 22] . Extensive simulations revealed that pre-GATA 8 (7): 191-205, 1991 Shu-Yun Le et al. dicted stem-loops just downstream of the \"slippery\" sequence are thermodynamically highly stable and their involvement in frameshifting is statistically relevant relative to other such configurations that may occur in these junction regions.",

This structure comprises tertiary interactions between single-stranded nucleotides in the stem-loop and nucleotides downstream of this stem-loop structure. Furthermore, Brierley et al.

These are RSV [23] , HIV-1 [24] , HIV-2 [24] , simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac and SIVagm) [24] , equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) [24] , visna virus (VISNA) [24] , BLV [25] , HTLV-1 [24] , HTLV-2 [24] , MMTV [2, 17], Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) [26] , simian SRV-1 type-D retrovirus (SRV-1) [27] , and two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 17.6 [28] and gypsy [29] , and the mouse intracisternal A particle (MIAP) [30] . Among them, different isolate sequences [24] of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVmac are also included. Putative RNA pseudoknots just downstream of the demonstrated and suspected frameshift sites are detected in these sequences by an extensive computer simulation. In the simulation analysis, the extended overlapping domain or junction domain (that is, gag-pol, or gag-pro and pro-pol domains) is selected to include 300 nucleotides (nt) both upstream and downstream from the potential frameshift site. The thermodynamic stability and statistical significance of all possible secondary structures that potentially occur in the extended , 11 Figure I . (a) Distributions of minimal stability score (dashed curvey~nd significance score (solid curve) in the gag-pol junction region (600 nucleotides [nt]) of RSV under different window sizes. For each window, the simulation was carried out by sliding one base along the RNA sequence. In this way the global minima of stability and significance scores were extracted and plotted against the window size. The exhaustive simulation was completed for window sizes ranging from 40 to 300 nt by increasing the window by 2 nt at a time. The deep valley A shows that the global minimal stability score in the extensive simulation is obtained when the window size is taken as 100 nt. (b) Distributions of highly stable RNA folding segment (dashed curve) and significant folding segment (solid curve) under different window sizes. The map was obtained by plotting the starting positions of these unusual RNA folding segments against the window sizes. When the window is taken as 100 nt, which is suitable to detect a both highly stable and more significant folding region, the starting positions (2484) of the highly stable and of the more significant folding regions coincide with each other, labeled A and B. The corresponding sequence position of the both highly stable and significant region is identified at 2484--2583.",

Currently, E r and SDr are computed using empirical formulas [34, 35] in all versions of SEGFOLD.

In this study, the exhaustive simulation of each retrovirus RNA is often performed for window sizes ranging from 40 to 300 nt (in some cases, 30-300 or 20-300 nt is used) by adding 2 nt at a time to the window size. For each window size, the calculation of significance and stability scores is carded out by sliding one base along the RNA sequence in the gag-pol or gag-pro and pro-pol junction domain (600 nt). In the simulation the global minima of the significance score and stability score and their corresponding segment starting positions in the sequence were extracted for each window. By comparison of these minimal scores, the unusual RNA folding region of both high stability and more statistical significance can be detected.

NEWFOLD incorpo-rates the Turner energy rules with penalties of asymmetric loops and internal loops closed by AU pairs [37, 38] . The determination of potential RNA pseudoknots was accomplished by a search program developed by Shapiro (in preparation) that currently runs on a SYMBOLICS 3675 Lisp machine. It accepts as input RNA structural information in the form of a region table and its associated sequence and produces as output a listing of all potential pseudoknots formed by loop-freebase interactions. Loop-loop interactions were filtered out in this case since we are dealing with specific significant and highly stable secondary structures formed in the vicinity of the slippage motif. Structural formation beyond this structure is not considered in order to model the paradigm presented by Brierley et al. [1] . Thus, a list of only loop-free-base interactions is presented as a result of the program. This list consists of a quadruple, which is analogous to the quadruples present in the input region table. That is, each quadruplet contains the 5' start position, 3' stop position, size, and energy of the potential knot regions. In calculating the latter energy, the unfavorable energy contributions of the pseudoknots loops were not taken into account. However, current practice is to use a constant value, for example, 4.2 kcal/mol [39] . These quadruples are depicted in sorted order increasing with respect to the 3' position so that one may easily judge the distance of the pseudoknot stem from the specified significant RNA secondary structure. In this study, the general scheme used to find potential frameshifting pseudoknots was to take the distinct secondary structures detected in step 1 and append -100 nt downstream from the structure. The algorithm then generated the sorted putative pseudoknots that formed for each of the sequences. The strongest interactions within a range of -50 nts downstream taking into account length and energy were used to determine the suggested site.",

The structural features of these predicted pseudoknots show that at least 2 nt (except for SRV-1) or 3 nts cross the deep or shallow grooves in stacking two double helical stems, respectively (see Table 1 ). Particularly, the pseudoknots following the \"slippery\" sequences of pro-pol frameshifting of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are structurally very well conserved. They contain an identical 13 bp (S1) with a bulge of nucleotide C and eight compensatory base changes in the tertiary interaction ($2). In the eight compensatory base changes of the conserved tertiary interaction, five base transitions and three base transversions are observed. The occurrence of compensatory base changes throughout the homologous stem $2 of related sequences HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 is very remarkable and allows for the high conservation of the tertiary structures despite their sequence divergence. It seems likely, therefore, that the highly conserved RNA tertiary structure is an essential element of the frameshifting signal of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.

The minimal length of S 1 and $2 appears to be 3 bp, and the minimal sizes of the loops L1 and L2 that bridge the deep and shallow grooves appear to need 2 nt and 3 nt, respectively. Recently, they also proposed that the deep groove (L1) can be bridged over 6 bp by 1 nt only [14] . Among the predicted pseudoknots of these retroviruses, the RNA tertiary structure predicted in SIVmac seem likely to be doubtful according to the sterical contraints. In the predicted RNA tertiary structure adjacent to the \"slippery\" sequence of gag-pol frameshifting of SIVmac 4 nts cross the shallow groove of the double helix (18 bp) with a bulge of one base and an interior loop of two bases. The shortest distance that bridges a shallow or deep groove depends on the number of base pairs in the stems S1 and $2 of the pseudoknot; however, it is possible that other structural factors, the number and types of nucleotides in the bulge or interior loop, and their position in S1 are involved in the complex event. Recently, Lilley and coworkers [41] have found that bulges introduce pronounced kinks into RNA helices. In the case of pseudoknots of SIVmac, the RNA tertiary structure seems sterically possible. One possible explanation is that the first 2 bp in S1 have to be melted to form the stacking of two stem segments. Thus, the stems S1 (16 bp) and $2 (6 bp) are connected by the loops L1 (2 nt) and L2 (7 nt) such that a right-handed, quasi-continuous double helix of 22 bp is formed. In this case, the distinct RNA stemloop structure (S 1) changes to be identical with the predicted structure model suggested by Madhani et al. [40] . It should be mentioned that Brierley et al. [1] have proposed six RNA pseudoknots of retroviruses RSV (gag-pol), BLV (pro-pol), HTLV-1 (pro-pol), MMTV (gag-pro and pro-pol), and VISNA (gag-pol). The putative RNA pseudoknots of retroviruses MMTV presented in the report are quite different from those structure models. We found that several alternative secondary structures can form in the downstream region of the frameshift site of the MMTV (gag-pro). Using the extensive Monte Carlo simulation, five distinct unusual folding regions adjacent to the frameshift site were detected. They are regions A (3409- GATA 8(7): 191-205, 1991 The potential RNA pseudoknots were predicted by extensive searches of all possible interactions between the nucleotides of the loop in the distinct secondary structure detected above and the nucleotides downstream from the stem of the secondary structure. Recently, it has been verified that the RNA downstream of the (-1) frameshift site of IBV folds into a pseudoknot [1] . We found that the stem-loop structure involved in the RNA pseudoknot is highly stable and significant in the junction region extending 300 nt upstream and downstream from the frameshift site of IBV. The distinct, unusual folding region can be detected by the extensive Monte Carlo simulation. The significance and stability scores are, respectively, -2.73 and -4.73. The stem-loop structure was derived from the NEWFOLD program. The results of our search program applied to the data are depicted in Figure 6 . The RNA pseudoknot of IBV proposed by Brierley et al. [1] can be predicted using the method presented in the report.",

            "text": "An interesting question raised by the study is why a retroviral frameshift site is closely followed by a pseudoknot structure consisting of coaxially stacked segments of a highly stable and statistically significant stem-loop structure, bridged by the connections of free nucleotides in the loop and downstream from the stem. Brierley et al. [I] have suspected that the tertiary RNA interactions may be a common feature of ( -I) frameshift sites. In this study, we show that the occurrence of these complex tertiary structures is not random. Except for the stem-loop structure downstream of the BLV pro-pol junction region, the significance score or stability score of these distinct stem-loop structures by chance are all less than -3.1. These structures, being both highly stable and more significant within 300 nt upstream and downstream of the frameshift sites of these retroviruses, are apparently relevant to some biological function of these viruses. In the case of RSV, a mutational analysis [3] has demonstrated that a deletion just downstream from the stem-loop greatly inhibits retroviral frameshifting. If an additional 22 nt downstream were replaced, however, frameshifting was restored to approximately wild-type efficiency. This result is consistent with the unusual RNA pseudoknot detected just downstream from the frameshifting site of RSV (see Figure 2b) . For the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, the RNA pseudoknots adjacent to their \"slippery\" sequences of pro-pol frameshifting are structurally well conserved. The tertiary interactions in the conserved RNA pseudoknots involve a strict pattern of coordinate base changes, that is, a one-toone correspondence between two positions where canonical pairing is maintained as a result of nucleotide substitutions. One possibility is that such extremely nonrandom RNA pseudoknot structures may act by stalling the translating ribosomes, where they promote the tRNA to slip back one nucleotide and pair with the codon in the -1 frame [2]. Based on these results, the RNA pseudoknot just downstream from the retroviral frameshifting site may be implicated in the (-1) ribosomal frameshifting event of retroviral translational systems. The possible control mechanism for frameshifting proposed by Jacks et al. [2, 3] and Brierley et al. [1] is strongly supported by this study.",

Thus, the hypothesis that the signal of frameshifting in HIV is the uuuuuu was suggested [42] . HIV-I, HIV-2, and SIVmac are related lentiviruses. HIV-2 shares -45% nucleotide sequence similarity with HIV-1 and 75% sequence similarity with SIVmac [43] . The \"slippery\" sequence UUUUUUA at the frameshifting site is consistently conserved in these different primate immunodeficiency viral species and isolates. In this study, we show that the predicted RNA secondary structure entangled in the putative RNA pseudoknots are both highly stable and statistically significant relative to other possible structures in the gag-pol junction domains of HIV-1, HIV-2, SIVmac, and SIVagm. Using comparative sequence analysis, we observe that the secondary structural features occurring at and downstream of the gag-pol frameshift site are conserved in the 14 HIV-1 isolates and 7 HIV-2 and SIVmac isolates sequenced to date. Although the sequence shows an extreme variability in this region in different species and in independent viral isolates, the striking similarity in the complexity, overall appearance, and location of the stem-loop are consistently present in the 14 isolates of HIV-1 (data not shown) and 7 isolates of HIV-2 and SIVmac (Figure 7b ).",

In seven RNA pseudoknots of HIV-2 and SIVmac retroviruses, the stable tertiary interaction of a Watson-Crick base pairs ($2) of the sequence AGCCCC in the hairpin loop with the complementary sequence GGGGCU just downstream from the stem-loop (S1) is structurally very well conserved. In the 42 bp of the tertiary interactions of seven species, only one noncanonical base pair G-G is found in isolate FG of HIV-2. It seems likely that the structure conservation of the RNA pseudoknots is significant. Even though the G-G is considered a mismatch, the RNA tertiary structure of isolate FG of HIV-2 may still be formed by [1] . The top part of the figure shows the individual loop or free-base segments and their 5' start position. The last sequence run represents that subsequence that is downstream from the predicted highly stable and significant structure. The bottom part of the output indicates the sorted quadruples with the half-region subsequences that form the potential pseudoknot stems. The annotation just above the list of quadruples indicates the total number of potential pseudoknot helices computed, the number that is listed, and the field (element of the quadruplet) on which the listing is sorted (in this case, the second field, the 3' position). Each quadruplet contains the 5' start position, 3' stop position, size, and energy of the potential knot regions. The potentially strongest tertiary interaction is located at the line marked by the asterisk (*). from the distinct stem-loop structure. However, one noncanonical base pair A-C is observed in isolates ELI and MN of HIV-1. Although a noncanonical base pair can also be considered a possible base pair in the RNA secondary or tertiary structure of tRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, and leader sequences of polioviruses [4 A, A.6], the tertiary interaction in these putative RNA pseudoknots of HIV-1 isolates is less stable than that predicted in HIV-2, SIV, and most other retroviruses. Moreover, the alternative tertiary interactions can also be found except for isolate HXB2, where the complementary sequence CUU is located 44 nt downstream from the distinct stem-loop structure. Thus the tertiary interactions in the putative RNA pseudoknot of HIV-1 are not absolutely conserved and less stringent. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the predicted RNA secondary structures adjacent to the frameshift sites of the 14 human immunodeficiency viruses are highly nonrandom and stable structures. Our results cannot explain why HIV frameshifting does not depend on stem-loop structures just downstream from the frameshift site.",

[40] have also observed that the frameshifting efficiency in the absence of the predicted RNA secondary structures at the frameshift site was not significantly different from that determined for wild-type HIV-1. Interestingly, the RNA pseudoknots can be folded throughout these mutants, which are used to destabilize the RNA secondary structure downstream from the frameshift site of HIV-1 (isolate SF2) by Madhani et al. [40] . In the putative pseudoknot of the wild-type isolate SF2 of HIV-1, a quasi-continuous coxial double helix of 14 bp is formed by stacking the stem $2 of 3 bp on S I of 11 bp. The analysis of the potential RNA pseudoknots of these mutants shows that, even if the base mutations in the double-helical region S1 (see boxes A and A' in Figure 7a ) destabilize the distinct, highly stable, and significant stem-loop structure (S1), the possible tertiary interaction between the bases in the hairpin loop and their complementary bases downstream from the stem-loop survive and are stabilized. For example, in the putative RNA pseudoknot of mutant B, S1 is destabilized by decreasing 8 bp, and the thermodynamic stability of tertiary interaction is strengthened by adding 5 bp to $2. Consequently, a quasicontinuous double helix of 11 bp is formed in the pseudoknot downstream of the frameshift site. Similarly, the quasi-continuous stems of 15, l l, 14, and 13 bp are also able to form in the pseudoknots of the mutants A, C, D, and E, respectively. Therefore, the thermodynamic stability of the complex tertiary structures can be partly compensated for by the strengthened tertiary interactions between the nucleotides in the hairpin loop and the free nucleotide span just downstream from the stem. If these pseudoknots indeed occur in these mutants, this may be a reasonable explanation for the experiments they did. Moreover, in the same report by Madhani et al. [40] , the other experiments demonstrated that the feature of sequences following the frameshift site can have dramatic effects on the frameshifting of HIV-1.",

[39] has the following features. It first enumerates a set of possible stems and then draws on these stems to construct a structure including stems that may form stable H-type pseudoknots. These pseudoknots consist of coaxial stacking of two stems with no intervening bases on one side [47] . This is similar to other kinetic secondary structure prediction programs [48, 49] . In contrast, our method is based on the evaluation of statistical significance, picking the most significant and stable structure.

The relationships between the window size and these global minimum scores (Figure la) and between the window size and these starting positions (Figure Ib) were plotted. In Figure la, the deep valley A, where the stability score is -3.90 (global minimum in the distribution plot), can be easily picked up for a window size of 100 nt. We also detected a corresponding deep trough B with the same window size, where the significance score is less than -5.0. The corresponding highly stable and statistically significant folding regions A and B can be assessed from Figure lb, while the window size is taken as I00 nt, determined by the distributions ofstability and significance scores (Figure la). In this case, the unusual RNA folding regions A and B coincide. Thus, the starting position of the unusual RNA folding region is 2484.

Obviously, the distinct stem-loop structure is appropriate for constructing the putative RNA pseudoknot of MMTV. The secondary structure entangled in the RNA pseudoknot suggested by Brierley et al. [1] is formed by folding region B. The hairpin loop structure is overlapped with the hairpin loop structures (hairpins A and C) predicted in regions A and C.
