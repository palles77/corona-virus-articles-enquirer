The reported 27 cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and many cases were related to the Wuhan Southern China Seafood Market, which was subsequently closed on January 1, 2020 4 . On January 7, 2020, laboratory test results showed that the pathogen of unexplained pneumonia was a new type of coronavirus, which was then officially named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) 5, 6 . The 2019-nCoV outbreak started in Wuhan, and then spread rapidly to other provinces and countries 7, 8 . As of January 30, 2020, a total of 34 provinces and regions in China have reported 9,692 cases. Nearly all imported cases were derived from Wuhan, Hubei province 9, 10 . The 2019-nCoV pneumonia was defined as a class B infectious disease but managed as class A infectious disease by the Chinese government. Daily case reports are being released and any omission or concealment is punishable by law. At present, the number of cases is still increasing and the epidemic has not yet reached its peak, but the situation differs by province. .",

Similarly, based on the probability threshold, the differences in these classification regions can be identified based on the trend over time. The probability that exp (b1i) is greater than 1 is divided into five categories: cities with an incidence risk probability greater than 0.8 have a rapid change trend relative to the overall risk change; between 0.6 and 0.8 indicate that the change trend of the incidence risk is greater than the overall risk change; 0.4 to 0.6 indicates that the occurrence risk is the same as the overall risk change trend; 0.2 to 0.4 indicates that the change trend of the disease risk is slower than the overall risk change; the change trend of the disease risk in cities with a probability less than 0.2 is more slower than the overall risk.",

The first death was reported on January 10, and the number of deaths began to increase rapidly from January 17, with the cumulative death number reaching 312 on January 30 ( Figure 1B ) 6 . After the nucleic acid assay becoming available, suspected cases waiting for laboratory confirmation could now be diagnosed more rapidly 17 . After January 19, suspected cases increased rapidly, and about 40-50% of these suspected cases were then diagnosed as confirmed cases ( Figure 1C ). Before January 19, the number of severe cases, remained at a low level but increased steadily since January 20 ( Figure 1D ). Because Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province and the cases have spread to the rest of Hubei province quickly, we also analyzed the change in number of cases in Hubei province. On January 9, 41 cases were first reported, and by January 30, 5,806 cases were reported, accounting for 59.91% of the total cases in China ( Figure 1E ). The cumulative number of deaths in Hubei province is 249, accounting for 96.14% of total deaths in China ( Figure 1F ). These data indicated that both the incidence and mortality of 2019-nCoV disease is the highest in Hubei province 18 . Before January 16, cases were mainly reported in Hubei province. From January 17 onward, the outbreak spread to many provinces and the number of cases increased rapidly. Therefore, our spatial and temporal analyses used data from January 17 to January 30, 2020.",

In general, the core outbreak area, Wuhan and its surrounding cities, had the highest number of cases, followed by cities with high population that are transportation hubs (Figure 2A ). Spatial distribution was then analyzed with a Bayesian model using WinBUGS 13, 14 . After iterating nearly 100,000 times, the model converged successfully. After the model converged, it iterated another 110,000 times to obtain parameter estimations.
