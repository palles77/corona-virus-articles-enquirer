Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 has both T at those sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and electrostatic distribution of S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19",

Among ZJ01 unique mutations, 10 (NO. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] were located on the S protein, including 3 samesense mutation, 2 deletion mutation and 5 missense mutation, which led to amino acid changes of Ser596, Gln613, Glu702, Ala771, Ala1015, Pro1053 and Thr1066. Further similarity analysis indicated that the main difference among various coronaviruses located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) region of S1. Intriguingly, the differences between ZJ01 and other members of SARS-CoV-2 mainly resided in in the S1/S2 and S2 (Fig 2B) . We proposed a novel categorization system for SARS-CoV-2, and defined type C for 8824C, type T for 8824T and type TT for ZJ01 as a special case, respectively. According to this system, we further categorized 54 strains of SARS-CoV-2-related virus (Fig 3C) . We found 83.3% and 95.7% T type in China (n=30) and Wuhan (n=23); 60% and 100% C type in Japan (n=5) and Tokyo (n=3); 53.8% C type in the USA (n=13), 83.3% T type in California (n=6) and 100% C type in Washington D.C (n=3). Intriguingly, of two cases from Illinois, one was T type and the other was named as Y type for Y in both nucleotide positions 8824 and 28247 , indicating the possibility of co-infection with both T and C types. Furthermore, TT type was only reported in Hangzhou.

Though the source of insertion was unknown, the PRRA sequence was common in Avian Influenza virus 29 . We deduced that its source might inherit from HKU1 and OC43, which had effective FCS in F1 site (Furin score 0.878 and 0.744) and respective amino acid of SSRRKRR and TKRRSRR, with high similarity of NSPRRAR in SARS-CoV-2. HKU1 and CO43 could cause human upper respiratory tract infection but the symptom was milder than SARS and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reckoned that the ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 may exchange gene with HKU1 or OC43 to obtain FCS in F1 site during evolution to human transmission (Fig 4C) . ZJ01 had Glu702 to Lys702 substitution at the site 18 th amino acid behind F1 site, and deletion (Ala771 to -) at the site 37 th amino acid ahead of F2 site. These mutations may influence the tertiary and quaternary structure of S protein and finally change the Furin binding capacity. F1-3 sites were conservative in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS (Fig 4D) , indicating the importance of mutation in these sites.",

ZJ01 had relative high number of 37 mutations and its RSCU was closer to humans than most members of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, ZJ01 was the only TT type of total 54 strains in our C/T categorization system.

The TT type of ZJ01 was unique in our system. Though a similar categorization system has been recently proposed 36 , they did not report such TT type in their 120 strains of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the C/T pattern could also be used to trace the route of virus infection and evolution. For instance, we found 8 strains of T type with RaTG13 and MP789 both had 8824C/28247T/29198T, we could speculate that these 8 strains of 29198T appeared earlier than strains of 29198C. Using this method, we reckoned that the earliest strains of SARS-CoV-2 was one patient admitted in Shenzhen hospital on 2020-1-10, whose entire type was 8824C/28247T/29198T/2682C/3812C/9606C/11125G/15667T/29808G. Besides, the earliest strain in the USA was from Phoenix, Arizona on 2020-1-26, whose entire type was 8824C/28247T/29198T/2682C/3812C/9606T/11125G/15667C/ 29808G. Patients with these two earliest strains both had exposure history to Wuhan. Therefore, we surmised that the origin of SARS-CoV-9 was still in Wuhan, but the earliest virus was still vague due to lack of enough samples (Supplementary Figure 1) .",

However, whether F3 site really exists and what is the function need further investigation. Furthermore, the target cell binding site of HKU1 and OC43 was on their S A segment of S protein while its corresponding site in SARS-CoV-2 was NTD. Therefore, except for the potential interaction in F1 site, there also exists the possibility of interaction in NTD segment between SARS-CoV-2 and HKU1/OC43. Viruses frequently undergo mutation and adjust its RSCU under evolutionary selection pressure to adapt to the host, facilitating better replication and dissemination 41 . The choice of Furin cleavage site might be an outstanding marker for coronavirus evolution. Meanwhile, we found that the mutation in ZJ01 may cause binding force change of FCS. All these data indicate that Furin might play a pivotal role in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The evolution trends of increasing FCS in SARS-CoV-2 we found in this study are more prone to influenza-like clinical manifestations such as human HKU1 and OC43 42 .",

Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might evolve to utilize this specific feature by increasing FCS to become more infectious on multi-organ levels. Our hypothesis was in consistent with changed clinical characteristics of COVID-19 from published data and our observation, including detection of virus in feces 34 and conjunctival secretions 35 , decreased severity/fatality, increased liver/kidney damage and symptoms of gastrointestinal tract, increased transmissibility and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity. Since ACE2 expression was quite low in the whole body including lung, we speculated that, on one hand, it might be the inflammatory reaction whereas not the viral road itself triggering severe respiratory damage; on the other hand, the utilization of Furin may help scatter virus attack from lung to other organs, contributing to the phenomenon of decreased severity but increased liver/kidney dysfunction. Nevertheless, all these speculations warrant further investigations.",

In detail, when the 8824 was T, its corresponding 28247 was C and vice versa. This pattern was confirmed in 52 out of 54 (96.3%) strains of SARS-CoV-2 and the only two exceptions were from ZJ01 (8824T/28247T) and MN988713 (8824Y/28247Y), where Y meant C or T. Interestingly, Bat coronavirus RATG13 (currently most similar to SARS-CoV-2) and Pangolin coronavirus MP789 (suspicious intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2) both had 8824C/28247T. There were near 20,000 base distance between these two nucleotide positions, and no functional correlation was found, where 8824 was in the middle of ORF1ab and 28247 was nearby N domain. Since mutation could not explain the perfect correlation between the base change of 8824 and 28247 nucleotide positions in 52 strains of SARS-CoV-2, the largest possibility was that certain strain of SARS-CoV-2 carrying 8824C/28247T strains kept replication during virus spreading and forming their own cladistics (Fig 3B). Though it is still unclear whether the appearance of 8824T/28247C happened in intermediate host stage or human infection stage, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 kept mutation in human transmission and formed the specific strain of ZJ01 (8824T/28247T).",

The F2 site of GZ02 was covered with negative charge while F2 site of Wuhan-Hu-1 and RaTG13 were covered with low level of positive charge. ZJ01 had more positive charge in F2 site than the other strains, probably caused by nearby gene deletion (Ala 771 to -). GZ02 had many negative charges in F3 site while few negative charges were identified in SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
