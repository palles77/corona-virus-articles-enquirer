Custom synthetic DNA inserts can be designed de novo in tandems of forward and reverse complement priming sequences to be inserted in circular plasmid vectors. To test this concept, artificial positive controls (APCs) for use in PCR were synthesized to contain primer sequences targeting four viruses (Barley yellow dwarf virus, Soilborne wheat mosaic virus, Triticum mosaic virus and Wheat streak mosaic virus) pathogenic to wheat and, as internal control, the plant mitochondrial nad5 gene. Thermodynamics and folding parameters of twenty-four APC inserts were assessed in silico. Two thermodynamically different APCs, designated optimal and sub-optimal, were cloned and tested using end point PCR. The optimal APC had a 100% amplification rate, while only 92% of virus-infected plant tissues, commonly used as reference positive controls, amplified. An array of APC priming sequences from different organisms and/or previously tested primers can be accommodated in a large and flexible number of positive control targets. APCs will streamline and standardize routine PCR, improve reliability and biosafety, and create opportunities for development and commercialization of new synthetic positive control sequences.",

            "text": "Examples of artificial plasmid constructs containing partial or complete sequences of a pathogen (or multiple pathogens) of interest are already in use or reported. Charrel et al. (2004) designed and constructed plasmids containing specific sequences of category A agents of bioterrorism, including exogenic sequences with inserted NotI sites and primers designed to amplify agent specific sequences and probes to detect specifically each sequence. Steps toward construction included: PCR amplification of targets and incubation to add restriction sites; column purification to discard residual small DNA fragments remnant from the restriction reaction; overnight incubation in the presence of T4 DNA ligase at 4\u00b0C; and cloning of the final product into a plasmid. Similarly, Inoue et al. (2004) constructed a recombinant plasmid harboring fragments of the pag and cap genes of Bacillus anthracis distinguishable from the authentic sequences by the presence of restriction enzyme sites, the EcoRV for the pag gene and the BamHI for the cap gene, respectively. Siegling et al. (1994) reported the construction of a multispecific control fragment containing 14 different templates for use in competitive PCR quantification of rat gene expression. Primer pairs did not exhibit 3\u2032-complementarity and spanned over one or more introns to facilitate distinguishing the amplicons obtained from cDNA from those from genomic DNA. The construction was made using complementary 40mer oligonucleotides cloned in a plasmid containing binding sites for both sense primers. Chomi\u010d et al. (2010) reported the construction of synthetic positive controls for the detection of Luteoviridae through RT-PCR. The sequences of forward and reverse primers were arranged into two fragments, and inserted in a plasmid. The two fragments were 152 and 161 bp long; however, the synthesis of oligonucleotides greater than 100 bases was not possible. Therefore, each fragment was synthesized as two separate oligonucleotides overlapping by 20 bp. Smith et al. (2006) also described a labor intensive procedure to produce synthetic controls including probes for only two targets, SARS coronavirus and rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (rGAPDH), for realtime RT-PCR (TaqMan). The method used the bacteriophage T7, RNA polymerase binding site included at the 5\u2032 terminus of the oligonucleotide to allow RNA transcription of the oligonucleotide. The reported strategies in all of these examples provide a safe and reproducible positive-control DNA template and also allow the detection of possible cross contamination, but their development in vitro was laborious and the constructs have been limited to a small number of targets. The approach to be described here is unique in its combinatorial primer design, enlarged capacity for targets, flexibility to rearrange and update, and elimination of pathogen sequences (intron, overlapping, etc.,) except for the primer sequences.",

Although PCR has been adapted for routine testing for pathogens of interest (Miller et al., 2009) , positive controls may be challenging to obtain (Smith et al., 2006) because not all proteins or pathogens are available as positive controls. Moreover, positive controls are especially difficult to obtain for exotic emerging pathogens, which are not commercially available in most cases, and require time-consuming obtaining of permits and clearances (Nechvatal et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2006) . Infected tissue, purified or cultured pathogen, and/or purified or expressed proteins are positive controls commonly used. However, well-documented risks associated with the handling or shipping of infected sample controls, particularly those carrying highly pathogenic microorganisms that are efficiently transmitted (Charrel et al., 2004; Inoue et al., 2004; Siegling et al., 1994; Smith et al., 2006) , threaten the biosafety of their use.",

Primers for BYDV and SBWMV were designed in this study. The Genbank accession numbers incorporated into consensus sequences for primer design of BYDV, SBWMV (RNA2), TriMV (Data not shown) and WSMV (Data not shown) are presented in Supplementary Table 2. Primer sequences targeting nad5 are from previously reported literature (Menzel et al., 2002) . All consensus and primer design regions were obtained after complete alignment of multiple nucleotide sequences using ClustalX (Larkin et al., 2007) . Forward and reverse primers were designed using Primer3 (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000) following reported parameters (Arif and Ochoa-Corona, 2012) . The \u0394G, secondary structures, selfand heterodimer formation of each set of primers were examined after matching and analyzing the outputs from the Primer3 'any' selfcomplementarity score, which was taken as a measure of its tendency to anneal to itself or form secondary structure, and mFold (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000; Zuker, 2003) . The specificity of each primer sequence was confirmed in silico by searching the NCBI nucleotide database using BLASTn (Altschul et al., 1990) . The preliminary in vitro performance of all primer sets was tested by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using virus infected plant tissue as positive controls for each targeted virus. Primers used for engineering APC inserts and performing PCR and RT-PCR are listed in Table 1 .",

In fact, APCs with vastly different thermodynamics based on in silico determined \u0394G, free energy of major secondary structure and number of predicted secondary structures (Supplementary Table 1 ) produced visually indistinguishable PCR product yield (Fig. 2) , indicating a larger range of thermodynamic difference between these two APCs will be required to influence PCR amplification or product yield.

DNA in the reaction is in equilibrium (Nelson and Cox, 2008) . With this assumption, \u0394G for unfolding was determined for all 24 APC inserts and the broadest possible \u0394G range was selected empirically. An Mfold unfolding plot \u0394G of 0.2 kcal mol \u22121 and free energy of the major secondary structure \u22120.6 kcal mol \u22121 were considered to reflect weak interactions among nucleotide bases allowing a more relaxed secondary structure close to the optimal \u0394G of 0 kcal mol \u22121 , while a plot \u0394G of 1.0 kcal mol \u22121 and free energy of the major secondary structure 1 kcal mol \u22121 were considered to reflect less relaxed and stronger nucleotide sub-optimal interactions (Supplementary Table 1 ) (Jacobson and Zuker, 1993) . In this experiment, PCR using Opt APC will be favored since it has a \u0394G closer to the equilibrium than SubOpt APC does (Nelson and Cox, 2008) . Our results are favorable considering that most APCs will be composed of previously validated primers, which are expected to have a balanced GC content (close to 50%), optimal \u0394G (close to zero) and minimal secondary structure. These characteristics should reduce the risk of secondary structure formation over the APC insert. Secondary structure is to be considered during the APC design because it can decrease PCR sensitivity by limiting strand annealing (Jensen et al., 2010) . Also, secondary structure in the form of stem-loop structures can lead to polymerase jumping and mispriming during PCR (Jensen et al., 2010; Weiss et al., 1994) . The presence of secondary structures within the structure of APC inserts can be easily overlooked while designing by calculating the \u0394G of the APC insert in silico, and the number of secondary structure and related free energy before the custom DNA synthesis. In general, the in silico assessment is precautionary because problems associated with folding among primers are not easily resolved by modifying annealing temperature, pH, and salt concentrations at the time of the reaction (Jacobson and Zuker, 1993; Fredman et al., 2004) .",

Such discrepancy should not be a problem. Certainly the operator knows what APC:sample size product to look for. The generation of products of different sizes by the infected positive control and the APC is appealing to some operators who like the ability to discern the two types of controls as well as to be able to recognize false positives resulting from cross-contamination of APC batches (Charrel et al., 2004; Tao and Zhang, 1998) . However, the option for reducing or eliminating the size discrepancy is available. The APC can be designed to have product sizes identical or similar to those expected with reference positive controls (Fig. 2 A) by reducing or adding non complementary nucleotides between primer sets until the desired product size is obtained. Confirmation and quality control can be verified by direct sequencing because each product corresponds to a specific APC sequence identity. Also, the restriction sites flanking the APC could be used to confirm that the correct primer pairs were used in a determination. Alternatively, further monitoring can be performed by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis which allows characterizing each DNA product or APC according to its dissociation behavior (Charrel et al., 2004) .",

The design in groups or tandems of APCs also brings flexibility to maintain and update a particular group of primers after certain period of time. For example, we can speculate upon an 200 bp long APC insert that harbors one linear array of five different targets with an average of 20 nt per primer (ten primers) (see Fig. 1 ), from which 120 bp PCR products are amplified (see Table 1 ). Because the APC sequence is expected to be designed with multiple primer inserts it is unlikely to expect no specific amplifications. Assuming that DNA segments up to 10 kb can be synthesized and cloned into pUC57 using sub-cloning and short DNA oligos as building blocks (Genescript, 2012) , an APC insert of 10 kb would carry 50 different sub-APCs in tandem containing 5 primer sets each, which is equivalent to 250 predetermined microbe targets. Such construct would allow a broad and diverse positive control to include a large number of pre-determined targets for numerous pathogens or genes, eliminating biosafety risks associated to the handling of high consequence pathogens.",

For just the BYDV target, the comparison of APCs vs. PCR yielded a difference of 100% to 94% (p = 0.0225). This difference is difficult to attribute to a single factor, and is primarily due to small sample sizes associated with the SBWMV, TriMV and WSMV targets. Actually, the biological significance for SBWMV, TriMV and WSMV is greater than that of BYDV (as evidenced by the greater differences seen in the percentages). This is why the significance for the total is much greater than that of just BYDV (p = 0.0006 vs. p = 0.0225). Loss of accuracy with traditional positive controls is normally associated with RNA or cDNA degradation, human errors occurring during the multi-step extraction, or during reverse transcription, PCR or one step RT-PCR (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 1987; Garber and Yoder, 1983; Park, 2007) . Furthermore, in the case of plants, plant-associated PCR inhibitors (polyphenolic compounds, tannins and polysaccharides) can cause anomalous association among PCR components during storage (Li et al., 2008; Murray and Thompson, 1980) and interfere with subsequent assays. This kind of interference was not observed within the APCs PCR amplification because APCs were tested on two-step RT-PCR, which freed APC reactions from host inhibitors making the reaction highly accurate.",

This approach offers the possibility of engineering single controls for a large number of predetermined targets. If adopted, this concept will find applications in many areas of microbiology. Moreover, APC constructs would be used in conjunction with EICD or alternative dry or paper based storage technology to facilitate preservation, shipping and commercialization. The implementation of APCs can eliminate biosafety risks associated with in vivo positive controls, can streamline and improve reliability of PCR detection and diagnostics, and offer new opportunities for development of synthetic positive control combinations to fulfill the demand of different health, forensics or agricultural markets.",
