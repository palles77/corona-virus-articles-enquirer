Our goal was to evaluate the frequency of influenza vaccination among SOT recipients with influenza disease and its impact on the illness severity during the 2010-2011 season. Adult SOT recipients with confirmed influenza infection were included from December 2010 to April 2011. Follow-up data were recorded and antibody titres were determined using a microneutralization assay. Sixty-four SOT recipients were included in the study, ten (15.6%) with severe disease, requiring admission to intensive care units, of whom four (6.3%) died. In all, 34 (53.1%) received the 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccine and 32 (50.0%) received the 2009-H1N1 pandemic vaccine, and none had detectable antibodies against influenza at the time of diagnosis of influenza infection. Twenty-three (67.6%) of the patients that received the vaccine required hospital admission and presented less dyspnoea (10, 29.4% versus 14 (50.0%), p 0.09) and pneumonia (8, 23.8% versus 15, 50.0%, p 0.03, relative risk 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.9) than unvaccinated patients, with relative risk reductions of 60% and 70%, respectively. Although influenza vaccination confers protection on SOT recipients against developing influenza pneumonia, the rate of clinical failure is still high. New strategies to improve influenza immunization are needed for this group of patients.",

However, the response to influenza vaccination in the transplant setting is discordant, with lower efficacy than in the general population with a seroprotection rate that varies between 15% and 90% [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Suboptimal vaccination response may be partly a result of the incomplete protection against influenza reported for vaccination in high-risk individuals [17] . Older individuals appear to be at particular risk for vaccine failure, perhaps as a result of immune senescence [18] .",

In a multicentre study mentioned previously, we demonstrated a rate of clinical failure after receiving one dose of the pandemic vaccine of 1.1% [20] . However, there are no clinical studies that evaluate the impact of the antecedent of influenza vaccination in the SOT recipients with influenza disease. Hence, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of non-adjuvanted 2010-2011 seasonal influenza vaccination among SOT recipients with influenza disease and its repercussion on the illness severity.",

To detect significant differences between groups, we used the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the t test, Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test for continuous variables, when appropriate.

This is especially relevant, as influenza infection must not be ruled out in influenza-vaccinated SOT recipients with respiratory symptoms or pneumonia in pandemic or epidemic periods. A high index of suspicion and an early diagnosis is mandatory, given the fact that, as previously reported, we found that time from onset of symptoms to initiating oseltamivir therapy was associated with the severity of the illness. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies characterizing the immunological response to influenza vaccine in SOT recipients. Although some of these studies have shown similar responses in renal [16] and liver [9] transplant recipients compared with that of the general population, most of them showed a reduced humoral immune response in renal [7, 10, 14, 15] , liver [8, 25, 26] , lung [27] and cardiac [6, 8] transplant recipients, with a seroprotection rate that varies between 15% and 90% [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and a lower seroprotection rate after vaccination of 78% compared with healthy subjects [7] . However, our results suggest that receiving the influenza vaccine confers protection against the development of pneumonia in patients with influenza infection because it was associated with a decreased risk of developing pneumonia and shorter hospital stay. Attenuation of disease severity has been described for other vaccines such as the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine against S. pneumoniae that was tested in the elderly, where vaccination was associated with a reduction of risk of death due to pneumonia complications [28, 29] . Limited data of a similar effect are available for nonreplicating influenza vaccines [30, 31] , but no studies have been performed in transplant recipients. Reduction in illness severity, even among those who are not protected against infection, would enhance the population health benefits of this vaccine.",

First, the number of patients included in the study may be underpowered to demonstrate the association of the mortality rate and previous vaccination. In addition, although all patients were advised to seek care at the hospital if they had respiratory tract infection symptoms, it is possible that some patients with mild influenza infection did not attend the hospital. However, all severe cases of influenza were included in the study. As the objective of the study was not to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the vaccine, but to determine vaccination frequency among clinical cases of influenza, the loss of some mild cases does not invalidate our results, which show that vaccination failed in half of SOT recipients with severe influenza. Finally, given the association of severity and seroconversion, the episode of respiratory illness could be caused by other microorganisms and the detection of influenza virus might be related to an asymptomatic colonization. However, although investigated, no other viral co-infections were detected in these patients and the positive predictive value of respiratory symptoms during the influenza epidemic period is very high [32] . We therefore think that these episodes corresponded to true influenza infections.",
