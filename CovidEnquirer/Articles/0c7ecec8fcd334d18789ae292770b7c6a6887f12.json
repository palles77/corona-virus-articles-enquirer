An estimated one million dogs are infected annually in the United States alone, despite the widespread availability and use of vaccines (Otto et al., 2001) . The virus first emerged in the United States during a nationwide outbreak in the fall of 1978 (Appel et al., 1980) and within two years the disease became established worldwide (Prittie, 2004; Greene and Decaro, 2012) . The disease is presumed to be spread by oronasal exposure or fecal ingestion and is understood to occur as a result of direct contact with contaminated feces or indirect contact with virus-contaminated objects in the environment (Greene and Decaro, 2012) . Enteric and myocardial forms of the disease exist but the enteric form is the most common form found in veterinary clinics, shelters, and kennels (MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2011; Greene and Decaro, 2012) .",

Young, growing dogs 9-20 weeks of age are most susceptible because the virus has an affinity for rapidly dividing cells (MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2011) . Factors thought to influence the severity of infection include: dog breed, age, gastrointestinal parasitism, overcrowded stressful environmental conditions, and co-infection with canine coronavirus (Smith-Carr et al., 1997; Sakulwira et al., 2003) . CPV is extremely resilient and is able to survive desiccation and extreme temperature fluctuations, allowing it to persist in the environment for months and possibly years (Greene and Decaro, 2012) . Two canine parvovirus types (CPV-2a and CPV-2b) were identified in 1980 and 1984 respectively (Greene and Decaro, 2012 ) and more recently a CPV-2c variant has evolved (Hong et al., 2007) . In the United States CPV-2b is currently the most common isolate from diseased dogs, whereas in Europe CPV-2a is more prevalent (Appel and Barr, 2009) .",

In his veterinary practice, located in the southeastern United States, the senior author has noted seasonal fluctuations in the number of CPV cases, with the highest incidence rates occurring during the spring and fall. Such fluctuations could be explained by variations in the seasonality of an insect vector. Flies have been implicated as CPV vectors (Greene, 1984) , which may help to explain how CPV reached pandemic proportions in only a few years. If flies are involved, it is important to know the particular fly family or fly family complex, and the vector capacity. The flies of interest are indigenous to most of the world and are referred to collectively as filth flies (White et al., 2011) . They are all attracted to food, feces, animal odors, and carcasses, and have been implicated in the spread of many enteric disease agents (Greenberg, 1971) ; historically, they have impacted military field arenas, disaster relief efforts and refugee support operations (White et al., 2011) .",

The animal odors and abundant food supply found in these environments make them especially attractive to these insects. Dissemination of CPV by flies would certainly increase opportunities for both dispersal and survival of the virus, since flies have been shown to fly 8 km/h (Murvosh and Thaggard, 1966) and up to 20 km in 24 h (Hogsette and Farkas, 2000) . In the canine shelter environment, mere physical separation of infected and healthy canines would not prevent this disease from spreading if flies can move between infected and non-infected animal quarters. Thus, if flies can be shown to actually transmit CPV, young susceptible dogs housed outside in the presence of flies would have an increased risk of contracting this disease.",

Most likely, host exposure is indirect via viral contamination of the host's environment by these insects. This indirect mode of transmission, combined with the virus's ability to persist in the environment, would make it difficult to determine how a particular host exposure occurred. A soil sample testing positive for virus was collected in early winter at the primary location, from an area where flies were still active but only healthy appearing dogs were kept. Thus shelter contamination by flies could occur and flies could contaminate the environment by spreading virus at this time of year, resulting in a source of infection that could link fall outbreaks to those of early spring. A statistically significant positive correlation between ambient temperature and fly numbers suggests that warm weather conditions could be a precursor to larger fly populations which could possibly indirectly influence the incidence of CPV disease. CPV disease has been reported by Houston et al. (1996) to show a distinct seasonality with a higher incidence occurring between July and September. Disease frequency itself probably does not have a distinct seasonal pattern but may be affected by fly numbers which, in turn, could be influenced by variations in climatic conditions. Thus, environmental factors have Table 3 Significant canine facility and vector-related risk factor associations determined from analysis of data from 37 canine facility surveillance locations. The Eta-squared values are a measure of the association or effect size and are interpreted as follows: 2.1% of the variation in the number of CPV cases that can be explained by the variation in the number of flies captured, 3.6% of the variation in the number of CPV cases that can be explained by the variation in the canine facility design, and 13.9% of the variation in the number of CPV cases that can be explained by been shown (MacLachlan and Dubovi, 2011) to affect disease occurrence, especially in those diseases transmitted by arthropods.

In the spring and early summer, it was evident that flies were more active and more numerous. Corresponding seasonal disease incidence was also found to be greatest at this time of year. Disease frequency was noted to increase again in the fall when these insects were observed to congregate or swarm in large numbers at canine and other animal facilities.

Random, isolated outbreaks at smaller shelters and kennels could possibly be attributable to fly food resources attracting flies carrying virus which then expose susceptible dogs through regurgitation of virus during feeding and transfer of virus to objects in the host's immediate environment.

A closed-design facility that eliminates, or at least significantly limits, flyingress and that allows for efficient disposal of animal waste would be an effective method of controlling and minimizing the spread of CPV disease if, as suggested by this study, these insects might play a role in disease transmission. It is only logical that open-design facilities would create more opportunities for fly-borne disease contagion than closed designs where flies have only limited or no access. A reasonable requirement would be to have at least a fully enclosed structure for housing young, particularly susceptible dogs. It is possible that closed designs, by having fewer flies and less fly-borne disease, could potentially reduce the expense of CPV-related medical treatments and also decrease the need for CPV disease-related euthanasia. Indoor quarantine facilities, separate from the main shelter area, would also be important and could prevent alreadyinfected animals from introducing disease to healthy individuals. The implementation of aggressive fly control, vigilant disease surveillance, vaccination, and routine sanitation using parvocidal disinfectants are also important additional measures (Greene and Decaro, 2012) . Commonsense approaches such as keeping doors and windows closed and employing screening and externally-directed fans at doors could also diminish fly entry. Covering trash receptacles, positioning them far away from entrances and areas where dogs are kenneled, and placing fly traps near waste drains could also help. The use of fly traps can be beneficial as they minimize insecticide use and decrease the development of insecticide resistance. Granular insecticide baits can be used outside at bait stations in locations where animals are denied access. 4 Additional studies evaluating the risk factors discussed here are still needed, however, to confirm these findings. Of particular importance is the need to conduct a conclusive confirmatory disease transmission study in which flies are exposed to a CPV-positive bait source and then are introduced to non-immune young dogs under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.",

Fly CPV-negative (PCR) results are represented by open circles and fly CPV-positive (PCR) results are represented by solid circles.
