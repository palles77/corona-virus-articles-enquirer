When lgM antibody detection is used, attention must be given to the vaccination history of the patient. Animals inoculated with CDV vaccine within the preceding 3 weeks may have a measurable IgM antibody titer to CDV. 5 The serologic detection of CDV -specific antibody in cerebrospinal fluid often is useful in detecting CDV infection in animals presenting with neurologic disturbances. 15 Antibodies are present in cerebrospinal fluid as a result of local production but also may be present owing to nonspecific damage to the blood-brain barrier. Local production of CDV-specific antibody, and its appearance in cerebrospinal fluid, occurs subsequent to central nervous system infection. Studies by Appel indicated that CDV-specific antibody could be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of dogs with subacute CDV encephalitis but not in dogs that recovered early or died acutely from infection. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid antibody to CDV was not detected in vaccinated dogs. 2 \u00b7 3 Nonspecific damage to the blood-brain barrier, resulting in leakage of serum antibodies into the cerebrospinal fluid, may be determined by comparing serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibody titers to other canine viruses, such as CAV-1 and canine parvovirus. 4 Postmortem diagnosis of CDV infection may be established using pathologic findings or by detection of CDV-specific antigens in tissues. Gross pathology is generally unremarkable; thymus atrophy and interstitial pneumonia may be observed. Histopathologic examination is much more informative and may reveal the presence of eosinophilic inclusion bodies; these are intracytoplasmic and intranuclear in the brain and in epithelial cells of the lung, stomach, bladder, and kidney. Inclusion bodies also may be detected by FAT; this technique is considered to be more sensitive than histopathologic detection. 21",

The presence of Negri bodies establishes a definitive diagnosis of rabies virus infection; however, in approximately 15 to 20 per cent of infected animals, these inclusions may not be detected. 25 Negri bodies are formed relatively late during the course of the infection and, therefore, may not be detected in those animals that die or are euthanatized prior to their formation. 17 The FAT is a sensitive and more accurate method of diagnosis than Negri body detection; this technique will detect infection in up to 98 per cent of affected animals. 17 Antemortem diagnosis of rabies virus infection also may be achieved by applying this technique to corneal scrapings and tactile hair biopsies. 6 However, false-negative results may be obtained if antemortem diagnosis is attempted early during the course of the infection, prior to centrifugal spread of the virus to peripheral tissues.
