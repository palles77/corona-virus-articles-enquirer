The relationship between cardiology and cardiac surgery can be a fragile one, particularly in an area of shifting finances and power within the hospital structure. Today we are collectively successful in shepherding children with congenital heart disease through even very complex reconstructions with an overall success rate approaching 98% to 99%. However, this results in a cumulative pool of patients needing life-long follow-up with cardiology but, ideally, rarely if ever with cardiac surgery. Within my professional lifetime, congenital cardiology departments have grown from being equal partners to being up to 10 times as large as surgical departments in terms of numbers of physicians and with increasing financial disparity. This is leading to stresses within congenital cardiac programs. But such stresses can be minimized by an administrative structure such as exists at Children's National Medical Center, where all decisions as well as hospital and professional revenues are managed collectively by the physician and administrative staffs.",

As a medical student at the University of Adelaide, I worked within a health care system that in those years was a reasonably successful balance of private and public funding. However, in the tradition of the British model, private and public patients were segregated into private versus govern- ment hospitals. One clear lesson that I took away from that experience was that if ever I was to be undertaking complex surgery in patients who would require intensive care management postoperatively, I would confine my practice to one hospital. This principle was reinforced by my mentor and good friend, Dr D'Arcy Sutherland, who established open heart surgery in Adelaide and who set me on the road to this podium ( Figure 4 ). D'Arcy was a master surgeon, a tremendously successful administrator, and one of the first in the world to recognize the importance of the careful collection of risk-adjusted registry data. At the very first AATS meeting that I attended in San Francisco in 1980, D'Arcy was the honored guest speaker. D'Arcy is alive and well in Adelaide and sends his best wishes to his many friends in the AATS ( Figure 5 ).",

D'Arcy began by recruiting the great surgical technician Dr Roger Mee ( Figure 8 ).

This is a remarkably difficult question to answer for a host of reasons, but it is a question that we are obliged to answer. Cardiothoracic training is still ultimately a mentorship, and there is a fundamental obligation on the part of the mentor to assist the trainee to have a productive and satisfying position at the end of the training process. For many years the AATS and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons have collaborated in intramural workforce studies. Recently, in addition, we have commissioned the American Association of Medical Colleges to undertake a review to try to help us understand the impact of the many external forces that are likely to influence our manpower needs.

New Guinea, as I learned when I was there, is a fascinating study of the consequences of difficult communication and transportation resulting from the dense and mountainous jungle terrain. The isolation of individual tribes has been associated with 400 unique languages among New Guinea tribes, which represents the densest concentration of diverse languages of any region of the globe.

In fact, some would say that globalization began with the emergence of intercontinental travel by sail ship and the emergence of the capitalist world system in the 1500s. The industrial revolution and the harnessing of power in the 19th century are cited by others as the origins of globalization. The modern era of economic globalization, however, can be pinpointed with great accuracy both geographically and chronologically. Figure 17 shows the Mt Washington Hotel, nestled in the beautiful White Mountains of central New Hampshire not too far from my own New England home. In July 1944, representatives from the 44 allied nations of World War II, which was still in progress, sowed the seeds for the establishment of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization. During the cold war years, these three institutions provided the economic armamentarium whereby Western countries pursued the objective of containing communism by providing loans to developing countries. After the fall of the Soviet Union, however, these organizations adopted a new agenda. The underlying goal has been to reduce global poverty and to improve economic opportunity and productivity throughout the Second and Third Worlds by opening markets, removing trade barriers, and through carefully monitored loans from the developed to the developing world. Supporters of globalization can produce powerful evidence that these goals are being achieved. 1,2 However, there is another side to the story, as I will examine in a few minutes. First, however, let us look at the health consequences of globalization and what these mean for us as cardiothoracic surgeons.",

One important outcome of this study was the development of a new metric, the disabilityadjusted life year, which allows assessment of the effect of disease not only on lifespan but also on health span. In essence, a life can be shortened not only by death but also by chronic disability. Figure 18 demonstrates that in 1990, communicable diseases such as respiratory infections remained the most common global cause of death and chronic ill health. However, projections by this study suggest that by 2020 ischemic heart disease will have become the number 1 disease entity, nearly doubling in less than 30 years. Health losses from cancer are also projected to nearly double over the same time frame. Economic development carries with it the consequences of an aging population and the hazards of smoking and high fat, high calorie diets. 4",

Widespread use of echocardiography, in fact, has resulted in earlier and more complete diagnosis of salvageable heart problems in children. Earlier recognition of congenital heart disease is eliminating the scourge of pulmonary vascular obstructive disease, which is making surgery available for a much greater percentage of the world's children with congenital heart disease than in the past. And the cumulative population of adults with congenital heart disease is also increasing the workload for many congenital heart programs.

One of the important efficiencies that is introduced by economic globalization is a rationalization of the distribution of goods and services through elimination of trade barriers. Obviously, it would make little sense for each of the 50 states of the United States to be totally self-sufficient and responsible for its own food supply. Likewise, we would consider it absurd that surgeons trained in Massachusetts could only ever practice within the state of Massachusetts. The problem of appropriate matching of supply and demand becomes particularly challenging as a service sector becomes increasingly subspecialized, such as is the case for cardiothoracic surgery. Within congenital cardiac surgery, the problem of matching supply and demand on a global scale has resulted in an interesting distribution of surgeons around the planet, often working in locations that are quite remote from their institution of training. My move halfway around the world is not unusual in our subspecialty of congenital cardiac surgery. For example, Dr Christian Brizard from Paris, France, is the director of the congenital heart surgical program in Melbourne, Australia. But as I can personally testify, individuals who have made such moves have done so only with the greatest difficulty because of many bureaucratic barriers related to specialty certification and visas. Surely within our tiny subspecialty, which comprises perhaps only 200 in the United States and I would guess no more than 1000 dedicated congenital cardiac surgeons globally, it would make sense to establish a system of global certification that would facilitate the movement of congenital heart surgeons from areas of contracting to expanding need. Toward this end, the AATS Council has recently agreed to support my initiative to legally incorporate a global council for the development of educational standards for congenital cardiac surgical training. This is a first step in a process of international certification of congenital cardiac surgeons. And ultimately it is a step that I believe will make sense for the other subspecialty areas within cardiothoracic surgery.",

However, as demand for cardiothoracic services begins to rise in the United States in the near future, and as the supply of graduating surgeons begins to fall in exactly the same time frame, it is quite likely that there will be a considerable undersupply of surgeons in approximately 5 to 10 years. It is important that the extensive US training system that is currently in place not be dismantled because it will soon be needed.

How will an expanded pool of cardiothoracic surgeons globally affect your hip pocket? According to the economist William Baumol, who has formulated the so-called Baumol law, service occupations such as medicine, nursing, and surgery are inherently inflationary because they are labor intensive. 8 For society as a whole, a source of increased economic wealth over time is the substitution of capital for labor. This is the very definition of rising productivity. The surgeon who performed 300 procedures in 1980 and 300 procedures in 2006 expects his real income to at least match the rise in the cost of living. However, since his productivity is unchanged and his real income has increased, he has contributed to inflation. But will an increasing pool of surgeons globally trained and certified to step into any position that becomes available result in falling compensation for surgeons. I believe there is a consensus among the economists that I have read that this is not likely to be the case. In a globalizing world, skills matter more than ever. 8, 9 While the wages and benefits of unskilled US steel and auto workers are falling toward global norms, in general Americans with high skills in contrast are being increasingly highly compensated. Globalization allows highly skilled Americans and others to offer those skills to the entire world rather than just locally. Furthermore, skilled workers in high income nations are paid not just on the basis of their productivity but also on the basis of local living costs and social norms of fairness. Americans prize health care greatly and many citizens today will aggressively search out the best health care. As economic conditions improve in Second and Third World countries, health is likely to become increasingly highly valued, and this will be reflected in the compensation that various societies globally will be prepared to pay for the best in health care.",

Although it is true that the number of individuals around the world living on less than $1 per day has decreased, the number living on less than $2 per day has substantially increased.

Thank you for coming to the great city of Philadelphia, which this year is celebrating the 300th anniversary of the birth of one of the great founding fathers of this nation, born in Boston but living most of his life in Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin (Figure 25 ) was a quintessential American, not only a scientific innovator but also a great business entrepreneur. But in addition, Franklin was a globalist. 15 He spent many years living in London and subsequently in Paris, where he played a critical role in international diplomacy. And at age 70, back in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin assisted Thomas Jefferson in writing that great document, the Declaration of Independence, which as we all know begins: \"We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" As cardiothoracic surgeons, we would all do well to emulate Franklin's energy, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit.
