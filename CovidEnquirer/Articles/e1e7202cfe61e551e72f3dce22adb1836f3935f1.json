A major task of the primary care physician is to identify those patients with acute pharyngitis who require specific antimicrobial therapy and to avoid unnecessary and potentially deleterious treatment in the great majority who suffer from a benign, self-limited, usually viral infection.

Influenza appears in epidemics, which in the United States usually occur between December and April. In military recruits, adenoviruses cause the syndrome of acute respiratory disease during the colder months. In civilians, acute respiratory disease occurs in the winter, and epidemics of pharyngoconjunctival fever occur in the summer. Streptococcal pharyngitis occurs during the respiratory disease season, with peak rates of infection in winter and early spring. Spread among family members in the home is a prominent feature of the epidemiologic behavior of most of these agents, with children being the major reservoir of infection [11] .",

None of the signs and symptoms listed in the table is specific for ''strep throat,'' however. Moreover, patients vary widely in the severity of their symptoms. Many cases are milder and nonexudative. Only approximately half of children presenting with sore throats and positive throat cultures have tonsillar or pharyngeal exudates [12] . Patients who have had a tonsillectomy may have milder symptoms. Children less than 3 years of age may have coryza and crusting of the nares; exudative pharyngitis caused by GAS is rare in this age group. On the other hand, the presence of cough, coryza (in children older than 3 years), hoarseness, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and/or anterior stomatitis is highly indicative of viral rather than streptococcal infection.",

Patients lacking the suggestive clinical and epidemiologic findings or manifesting signs and symptoms indicative of viral pharyngitis (see Table 2 ) need not be tested or treated with antimicrobial agents. Attempts have been made to incorporate clinical and epidemiologic features of acute pharyngitis into scoring systems that attempt to predict the probability that a particular illness is caused by GAS [14, [16] [17] [18] [19] . These clinical scoring systems are helpful in identifying patients at such low risk of streptococcal infection that further testing is usually unnecessary. Selective use of diagnostic studies for GAS will increase the proportion of positive test results and also the percentage of patients with positive tests who are truly infected rather than merely streptococcal carriers. The signs and symptoms of streptococcal and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap too broadly, however, to allow the requisite diagnostic precision on clinical grounds alone. Although some have suggested otherwise [1, 20] , empiric antimicrobial treatment based on clinical and epidemiologic grounds alone has been found suboptimal in cost effectiveness [21] and by prospective analyses [18] . Therefore, if the clinician is unable to rule out strep throat on clinical and epidemiologic grounds, further testing is required (see later discussion) [22] .",

It has a sensitivity of 90% or higher, as judged by studies employing duplicate throat cultures. Obtaining definitive results of the throat culture takes 18 to 48 hours. In the minority of patients who are severely ill or toxic at presentation and in whom clinical and epidemiologic evidence leads to a high index of suspicion, oral antimicrobial therapy may be initiated while awaiting the results of the throat culture. If oral therapy is prescribed, the throat culture serves as a guide to the necessity of completion of a full antimicrobial course or, alternatively, of recalling the patient for an injection of penicillin G benzathine. Early initiation of antimicrobial therapy results in faster resolution of the signs and symptoms, but two facts should be kept in mind. First, GAS pharyngitis usually is a self-limited disease; fever and constitutional symptoms are markedly diminished within 3 or 4 days after onset even without antimicrobial therapy. Thus, antimicrobial therapy initiated within the first 48 hours of onset will hasten symptomatic improvement only modestly. Second, it has been shown that therapy can be postponed safely up to 9 days after the onset of symptoms and still prevent the occurrence of the major nonsuppurative sequela, acute rheumatic fever [23] .",

Currently available commercial test kits yield results that are highly specific for the presence of GAS. Thus, a positive RADT can be considered equivalent to a positive throat culture, and therapy may be initiated without further microbiologic confirmation. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of most of these tests ranges between 70% and 90% when compared with the blood agar plate culture [24] . For this reason it is necessary to back up negative RADTs with a conventional throat culture. One possible exception to the need for such backup relates to adults, in whom the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis is relatively low and the risk of a first attack of acute rheumatic fever in North America is minimal [25, 26] .",

Penicillin, however, remains the treatment of choice because of its proven efficacy, safety, narrow spectrum, and low cost. Amoxicillin often is used in place of oral penicillin V in young children; the efficacy appears equal, and this choice is related primarily to superior palatability of the suspension. Erythromycin is a suitable alternative for patients allergic to penicillin, although increases in GAS resistance to this agent have been reported in certain localized areas of the United States.

The organism is detected more readily on human-than sheep-blood agar plates and thus may not be identified in the routine throat culture. Thus, the clinician should suspect A haemolyticum infection in a teenager or young adult who has an acute pharyngitis and scarlatiniform rash but a negative culture or RADT for GAS. Should antimicrobial therapy of a patient who has A haemolyticum pharyngitis be elected, a macrolide or, alternatively, a betalactam antimicrobial agent may be prescribed.",

The pharyngeal manifestations that have been described include erythema, tonsillar enlargement, and, less often, exudate with cervical lymphadenopathy. In a recent Italian study, 133 children who had acute tonsillopharyngitis were tested for M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae with acute-and convalescent-phase titers and PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates.

Tests for p24 antigen or, preferably, quantitative assays for plasma HIV RNA by branched chain DNA or PCR should be performed. The viral load can be anticipated to be very high during this acute phase of infection. An HIV antibody test always should be performed later in time to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of acute retroviral syndrome with highly active antiretroviral medication has been controversial, current recommendations consider the use of antiretroviral medications in the setting of acute HIV infection to be optional [63] . Potential benefits of antiretroviral therapy in acute HIV would be to decrease the severity of acute disease and to decrease viral replication. Studies have demonstrated improvement of laboratory markers of disease progression when highly active antiretroviral therapy is used in acute HIV infection [64, 65] . These results would suggest a decrease in progression and transmission of the disease. Treating acute HIV infection, however, also can have potential risks, including known side effects to medications, possible development of resistance, and adverse effects on quality of life. If the patient and clinician elect to start antiretroviral medications, the goal should be suppression of viral replication.",

They are moderately painful and usually number less than a dozen. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease also is caused by coxsackie A. It is characterized by a febrile vesicular stomatitis with associated exanthema. The oral findings include small, painful vesicles in the buccal mucosa and tongue that can coalesce and form ulcerative bullae.

This form of pharyngitis represents primary infection in immunocompetent patients but can occur as a reactivation of latent virus in immunocompromised hosts. Although the characteristic presentation consists of small vesicles and ulcerations in the posterior pharynx and tonsils, HSV also may produce pharyngeal erythema and exudates at times indistinguishable from strep throat. Lesions may extend to the palate, gingiva, tongue, lip, and face. General symptoms include fever, malaise, inability to eat, and cervical lymphadenopathy.

            "text": "Acute epiglottitis or supraglottitis is an inflammatory process of the epiglottis and adjacent structures that can lead to life-threatening acute respiratory obstruction. In the past, epiglottitis occurred most frequently in children between 2 and 4 years of age and was associated mainly with Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) infection. Since the initiation of the childhood vaccination programs, epiglottitis caused by this organism is much less common. Nevertheless, there are still cases of Hib epiglottitis in both immunized and nonimmunized children, and the possibility of an infection with this pathogen cannot be excluded completely in vaccinated patients [80, 81] . Bacteria associated with epiglottitis nowadays include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta hemolytic streptococci. Multiple agents including other bacteria, viruses, and fungi have been implicated in rare cases. The typical presentation in children includes fever, irritability, sore throat, and rapidly progressive stridor with respiratory distress. The affected child adopts a forward-leaning position, drooling oral secretions while trying to breathe. Adults usually present with sore throat and a milder disease, although airway compromise can occur also. Physical examination of patients suspected of having epiglottitis requires careful inspection of the oropharyngeal and suprapharyngeal area. The diagnosis requires direct visualization of an erythematous and swollen epiglottis under laryngoscopy. Because of the risk of airway obstruction, this procedure should be performed in children only when skilled personnel and equipment to secure the airway are available [82] . Once the airway has been secured, culture of the surface of the epiglottis along with blood cultures should be obtained to guide antibiotic therapy. Management focuses on two important aspects: close monitoring of the airway with intubation if necessary and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Because of the aforementioned possibility of failure of vaccination, antibiotics should be directed against Hib in every patient regardless of immunization status. Cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ampicillin/sulbactam are appropriate choices. Steroids are used commonly in the management of acute epiglottitis although no randomized trial has been done to support this practice. When a case of Hib epiglottitis is diagnosed, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that postexposure prophylaxis with rifampin be given to household contacts when there is at least one child in the household younger than 4 years of age, a child in the household younger than 12 months of age who has not received the primary series of Hib vaccine, or an immunosuppressed child, regardless of that child's Hib immunization status [83] .",

Equally important is minimizing unnecessary and potentially deleterious overtreatment of viral infections with antimicrobial agents.
