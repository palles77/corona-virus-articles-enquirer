The role of the individual-based linkage between different spatial domains is investigated. As we adjust the timescale parameter \u03c4 from 0 to unity, which represents the degree of activation of the individual-based linkage, three regions are found. Within the region of 0 < \u03c4 < 0.02, the epidemic is determined by local movement and is sensitive to the timescale \u03c4 . Within the region of 0.02 < \u03c4 < 0.5, the epidemic is insensitive to the timescale \u03c4 . Within the region of 0.5 < \u03c4 < 1, the outbreak of the epidemic is determined by the structure of the individual-based linkage. As we keep an eye on the first region, the role of activating the individual-based linkage in the present model is similar to the role of the shortcuts in the two-dimensional small world network. Only activating a small number of the individualbased linkage can prompt the outbreak of the epidemic globally. The role of narrowing segregated spatial domain and reducing mobility in epidemic control is checked. These two measures are found to be conducive to curbing the spread of infectious disease only when the global interaction is suppressed. A log-log relation between the change in the number of infected individuals and the timescale \u03c4 is found. By calculating the epidemic threshold * L.-X. Zhong et al. / Physica A 436 (2015) 482-491 483 and the mean first encounter time, we heuristically analyze the microscopic characteristics of the propagation of the epidemic in the present model.",

In relation to the measures for disease control and prevention, the government usually takes isolation measures to prevent the epidemic. For example, during the outbreak of the 2014 Ebola epidemic, most countries tighten up on the rules for admitting people into the country. Alvarez Zuzek et al. have measured the effect of isolation in the multiple network [53] . The epidemic threshold is found to increase with the rise of the isolation time. S. Bonaccorsi et al. have studied the epidemic on the networks that are partitioned into local communities [54] . Their results indicate that knowing the spectral radius of the graph is quite important in judging whether an overall healthy state is stable or not. V.M. Kenkre et al. have studied the effect of confinement on the spread of epidemics in a system of random walkers who move in n dimensions [55] . They have found that the spread of the epidemic has a non-monotonic dependence on the extent of the home range of the individuals. A. Apolloni et al. have studied the effect of population partitions, mixing patterns and mobility structures on the spread of the epidemic [19] . Some efficient strategies controlling the pandemic potential have been found. The related work can also be found in Refs. [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . A.X. Cui et al. have studied the effects of strong ties on the spread of the epidemic [61] . They have found that the epidemic prevalence is promoted by the strong ties. Although the mobility patterns and connection patterns have been considered as important factors for the spread of the epidemic, most of the studies focus on the effects of immunization and isolation, which especially rely on the knowledge of one's activity routine and one's friendship network. Generally speaking, compared with the route of random walk, a predefined interaction structure is much easier to be understood. In view of the coupling of random walk and predefined interaction structure, the effect of local activity restriction on global epidemic suppression and the role of the shortcuts existing between the individuals geographically far away are worth extra attention.",

In order to model the evolutionary dynamics in local movement and global interaction (activating the prearranged linkage) respectively, we incorporate a multi-layer network with two subnetworks, which are called residential area and relationship network respectively throughout the paper, into the SIS model. The restricted residential area is common in territorial animals, where each individual is confined to local area and shares overlapping area with their neighbors [66, 67] . The relationship network is common in human society, which is a kind of relatively fixed person-to-person relation and has nothing to do with geographic distance [64] . Such relationship is usually modeled as a random network, a small world network or a scalefree network [68] [69] [70] [71] .",

If he chooses ''No'', he does not make a movement. After the movement decision has been made, for an infected individual, he becomes susceptible with probability p s .

To find out the relationship between local behavior and global behavior, in the following, the effects of three parameters on epidemic control are investigated respectively. The three parameters are: the area of segregated spatial domain s, the frequency of the interactions resulting from prearranged linkage \u03c4 , and the ratio of segregated spatial domains with activity restriction \u03b6 (called slow domain in the following). Fig. 3(a) displays the averaged ratio of infected individuals \u03c1 I as a function of s for \u03c6 = 0.01 and \u03c4 = 0, 0.001, 0.01 respectively. For \u03c4 = 0, as s increases from s = 9 to s = 121, \u03c1 I increases quickly from \u03c1 I \u223c 0.04 to \u03c1 I \u223c 0.58. As s increases from s = 121 to s = 2601, \u03c1 I increases slowly and finally reaches its maximum value \u03c1 I \u223c 0.62. Increasing \u03c4 leads to an overall rise of \u03c1 I within the whole range of 9 \u2264 s \u2264 2601. The smaller the value of s, the more sensitive of \u03c1 I to the change in \u03c4 . The above results indicate that, by narrowing the segregated spatial domain (called activity domain restriction in the following), the epidemic spread may be inhibited, the effect of which depends on whether there exists global interaction or not. A higher frequency of global interaction will make activity domain restriction become less effective. Fig. 3(b) shows the relationship between the change of \u03c1 I , \u03c1 I = \u03c1 s=2601 I \u2212 \u03c1 s=9 I , and the time scale \u03c4 .

            "text": "The propagation speed of the epidemic is related to the pairwise interaction between an infected individual and a susceptible individual. If the mean first encounter time between different individuals is small, it is much easier for the epidemic to break out. On one-dimensional lattice with segregated spatial domains, it has been found that the mean first encounter time is related to the size of the segregated domain d x and the size of the overlapping area d x [62] . In the present model, the individuals are confined to two-dimensional lattice with segregated spatial domains. By calculating the mean first encounter time, we can find out the relationship between the encounter probability and the variables of the size of the segregated domain s and the average number of individuals in each segregated domainn. The microscopic characteristics of the epidemic on a two-dimensional lattice with segregated spatial domains can be understood. In Fig. 6(a) we plot the mean first encounter time as a function of the average numbern of individuals in each segregated spatial domain for \u03c6 = 0. For simplicity and refraining from the border effect, here we only consider the case where the domain is satisfied with the condition d x = d y . It is observed that, for d x = d y = 5, asn increases fromn = 1 ton = 10, t c decreases from t c \u223c 280 to t c \u223c 50. Increasing d x (d y ) leads to an overall rise of the value of t c . A scaling law for t c \u223c 1 n \u03b3 , in which \u03b3 \u223c 0.73, is found. As the value of d x changes from d x = 5 to d x = 15, the value of \u03b3 changes little. In Fig. 6 (b) we plot the mean first encounter time as a function of the size of the segregated spatial domain forn = 1. A scaling law for t c \u223c 1 s k , in which k \u223c 1.96, is found. Comparing the results in Fig. 3(a) with the results in Fig. 6(a) and (b) , we find that a decrease in \u03c1 I by narrowing the segregated spatial domain should result from the competition of the following two processes: a decrease in the area of the segregated spatial domain and a decrease in the average number of individuals in each domain. In the present model, the population size and the spatial size are fixed. A decrease in the size of the segregated spatial domain leads to an increase in the total number of the segregated spatial domains and a decrease in the average number of individuals in each domain. From the simulation results in Fig. 6(a) and (b) we find that a decrease in the size of the segregated spatial domain leads to a decrease in the mean first encounter time while a decrease in the average number of individuals in each segregated spatial domain leads to an increase in the mean first encounter time. In the present model, the decrease of the mean first encounter time resulting from the decrease of the size of the segregated spatial domain should be slower than the increase of the mean first encounter time resulting from the decrease of the number of individuals in each segregated spatial domain. Therefore, the coupling of the above two contradictory processes leads to the occurrence of the macroscopic characteristics of the outbreak of the epidemic in Fig. 3(a) , that is, the smaller the size of the segregated spatial domain, the lower the ratio of the infected individuals in the final steady state.",
