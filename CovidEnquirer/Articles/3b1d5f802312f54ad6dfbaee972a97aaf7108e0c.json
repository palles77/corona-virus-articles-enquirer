As part of a trial of pandemic influenza vaccines, which included 1 year of prospective, active, community-based surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) in 17 centers in eight countries, 8 we evaluated the prevalence and incidence of respiratory viruses in children 6 months to less than 10 years of age at first vaccination.",

Most studies of viral epidemiology use hospital-based surveillance because community-based surveillance is difficult and expensive. However, hospital-based surveillance tends to capture only the most severe illness and many cases are missed in developing countries because of limited hospital access. Our analysis avoided these limitations and allowed us to capture the burden of virus-associated ILI in communities. Understanding community epidemiology is essential to implement effective control measures. Other advantages of being part of a clinical trial included a wellcharacterized population, wide age range up to 10 years, samples taken from a high proportion of children, consistent methodology between countries, and use of sensitive and validated PCR assays.",

The exact timing of enrollment varied somewhat between countries, but was planned so that data collection was performed during the peak 2010e2011 influenza season for each individual country. As stated in the Methods, all children were followed for 385 days, with the complete period of surveillance for the study occurring between 15 February 2010 and 19 August 2011. This allowed us to compare the distribution of viruses across the different countries. There was considerable variation in the incidence and prevalence of the viruses by country, although rhinovirus/enterovirus had by far the highest incidence and prevalence in all countries. HBov had consistently the lowest incidence and prevalence. Several other studies have evaluated the prevalence of viruses in children with respiratory illness. The relative prevalence of the different circulating viruses varied by study. However, the main circulating viruses were similar between studies and with our study, and included picornaviruses (including rhinovirus), adenovirus, RSV, bocavirus, PIVs, hMPV, influenza and coronavirus. 13e17 Rhinoviruses are classified in the picornavirus family, of the enterovirus genus. 7 A high prevalence of this family has been reported in other studies in different settings. 13,14,18e20 As in our study, an Australian study with active community-based surveillance of healthy preschool-age children with ARTI found that picornaviruses (including rhinoviruses) were the most frequently detected (41.3%). 13 However, other viruses were detected less frequently than in our study: RSV (6.6%), parainfluenza (4.1%), influenza A and hMPV (both 3.7%), adenovirus (3.1%) and coronavirus NL63 (1.5%). 13 In another prospective Australian study in children aged 6 months to 3 years reporting ILI, rhinovirus was again the most commonly detected. 15 However, in contrast to our results, adenovirus was detected at the same frequency as rhinovirus, followed by parainfluenza 3, polyomavirus, hMPV and HBov. 15 Influenza (A/H1N1) and RSV were relatively uncommon; approximately 40% of children were fully or partially vaccinated against influenza. Rhinovirus is not always the most commonly detected virus in children with respiratory disease. In children under 5 years of age hospitalized for LRTI in Thailand, the most commonly detected viruses were RSV (19.5%), rhinovirus (18.7%), HBov (12.8%) and influenza (8.2%). 16 A study of children aged <3 years hospitalized for LRTI in Brazil found that RSV was most prevalent (53.5% of episodes), followed by hMPV (32.3%), rhinovirus (20.8%), influenza (12.7%), HBov (10.4%), parainfluenza and adenovirus (both 6.5%) and coronavirus (1.2%). 17 In our analysis, influenza prevalence increased with age. The other viruses showed the opposite trend, with the lowest prevalence observed in the oldest children (60\u00fe months). There was a less obvious pattern in younger ages, but, in general, prevalence of all viruses except influenza declined with age. Despite this, the burden of illness remained considerable in older children.",

ILI associated with influenza resulted in the highest proportion of children missing school or daycare (52%), although 20e40% of children infected with the other viruses also missed school or daycare. There was no difference between viruses in the proportion of children hospitalized. Clinical features were variable depending upon the viral infection associated with the ILI episode. Study limitations have been described previously. 9 Only healthy children participated in the trial, limiting generalizability. In addition, our study did not include any children aged <6 months and only a limited number of children aged 6e11 months, so our findings are mainly relevant to older children. Fever was part of the ILI definition, and therefore we would have missed cases in children with no fever. To put this into perspective, in the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project, 34% and 43% of cases among children aged 1e4 years and 5e17 years, respectively, met the ARTI definition which did not require fever, but did not meet the ILI definition which did require fever. 18 However, our definition of ILI was somewhat broader (except in children under 2 years of age) and US data may not be generalizable to the tropical and southern hemisphere countries in our study. The inclusion of only healthy children in the study and the exclusion of cases with no fever would have underestimated the burden. We also could not discriminate between rhinovirus and enterovirus by PCR, therefore the exact prevalence and incidence of each one could not be determined. Finally, our study included only a small number of pneumonia cases (n Z 20), limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the distribution of viral infection in these cases. The overall pneumonia detection rate in the clinical trial (0.9%) is higher than, but in line with, what has been reported in the US for hospitalized cases. 24 However, our sample collection rate among pneumonia cases was only 62.5% compared with 80.0% for ILI overall.",

A substantial burden of illness occurs in older children. Data on the epidemiology of respiratory viruses determined from active surveillance of healthy children are generally lacking, and are particularly sparse in the developing countries included in our study. A considerable amount of the burden would not be identified through hospital-based surveillance. These novel data fill an important gap in our knowledge of the epidemiology of viruses contributing to the substantial burden of respiratory disease in children, and may be useful in informing priorities for implementation of existing vaccine programs and development of new vaccines.
