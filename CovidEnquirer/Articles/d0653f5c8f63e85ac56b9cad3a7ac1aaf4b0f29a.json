We calculate the basic reproduction number R 0 by utilizing the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Our results show that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and that the disease dies out if R 0 is below 1; otherwise, the disease will persist and converge to a unique positive stationary state. This result may suggest effective control strategies to prevent disease through media coverage and education activities in finite-size scale-free networks. Numerical simulations are also performed to illustrate our results and to give more insights into the dynamical process.",

For example, a survey found that three tabloids and two broadsheets ran a total of 1153 news stories involving severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Britain from March to July 2003 [10] , while the New Zealand Herald ran 261 articles from 13 March 2003 to 11 June 2003 [11] during the spread of SARS. On the one hand, as the number of infected cases increases, the media coverage may give more reports (maybe the number of infections and deaths per day, the locations where these happen, the symptoms of the disease) about them, while on the other hand, it can certainly cut down the opportunity and probability of contact transmission among the alerted susceptible populations, which is beneficial to the control and prevention of disease for further spreading. Many compartmental models [2, [6] [7] [8] 5, 12] have assumed that media coverage could reduce the contact rate between susceptibles and infectives.",

A few models have used network-based or individual-based approaches by adding the dimensions of massive news coverage. In fact, the spread of an infectious diseases in a population depends not only on the pathology of the disease itself, but also on the structure and mix patterns of the population. There are extensive investigations on overcoming this shortcoming, and one important effort along this direction is the use of complex network models, since the spread mechanism of diseases on networks has been widely studied by many researchers [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .

Statistically speaking, p(k) is the probability that a vertex chosen randomly has degree k [25] . Various studies [26, 25, 27] have revealed that the degree distribution p(k) of most real-world networks is highly skewed, and that it usually follows a power law p(k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 [28] . Pastor-Satorras et al. [29] found that there was a nonzero epidemic threshold \u03bb c in a homogeneous network as the classical prediction [30] , and a surprising absence of any epidemic threshold or \u03bb c = 0 in the heterogeneous counterpart if 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3 and if the network size approaches infinity. This surprising result gave a good explanation to the behavior of a long-standing computer virus in computer networks [16] . For finite size scale-free networks, Pastor-Satorras et al. [19] introduced a maximum degree k c that came to a nonzero threshold, but when k c increased or the network size approached infinity, \u03bb c would still approach zero. However, Zhou et al. [22] considered the fact that in reality the hub nodes might be only able to contact a limited population at one period of time despite their wide acquaintance, and proposed an epidemic model with identical infectivity for each infected individual which came to a constant threshold \u03bb c independent of the degree distributions and the network size.",

In particular, media coverage has a great impact on individual behavior towards the disease, and further affects the government health care interventions to control the spread of such disease. It is media coverage that may provide people with more information about the disease to take precautions such as distancing, wearing protective masks, vaccinations, to reduce the chances of being infected.",

When disease transmission is modeled on networks, individuals are treated as nodes, and potential contacts among individuals as edges. To address the heterogeneity in the contacts among individuals, the population is divided into n distinct groups of size N k (k = 1, 2, . . . , n) such that each individual in group k has exactly k contacts; here, n denotes the maximum degree of all nodes. If the whole population size is N (N = N 1 + N 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + N n ), then the degree distribution is p(k) = N k /N according to the previous section. The value \u27e8k\u27e9 = \ued71 k kp(k) is the average number of contacts each node (individual) can make. In epidemiology, there are two important and fundamental epidemic models: SIS and SIR [30] . For the SIS model, each individual can be in two states: S, susceptible to the disease, and I, infectious individuals who can transmit the disease to the susceptible one. A susceptible R, recovered/removed; they cannot be infected again.",

In order to incorporate the dimensions of massive news coverage, we introduce the information variable M(t) to describe the cumulative density of media coverage in that region at time t. d'Onofrio et al. [34] considered two distinct possibilities: (a) M only summarizes information about the current state of the disease, i.e. M only depends on current values of state variables, and (b) M also summarizes information about past values of state variables. In the present study, we adopt a linear form of (a), i.e. M is a linear function of the current prevalence of the disease (see Ref. [34] and the references cited therein). This preliminary work will focus on a static network, i.e. ignoring the population demographics (recruitment or death), and it considers the situation where the media coverage only reduces the transmission rate between susceptible individuals and infected individuals.",

In addition, we use another parameter m 0 to reflect the density level of media coverage on the disease even though there is no infectious case in the region under consideration. This can be explained as follows: due to the increasing trend of globalization and the development of information technology, information about infectious cases found in one region may spread rapidly to another region without this disease through media coverage, for example, in the case of the media coverage of the outbreak of SARS in 2003.

There are some unanswered questions with our model.

If m 0 = 0, although the media coverage does not change the basic reproduction number R 0 , it can reduce the final prevalence (density); see Fig. 4(b) . In order to prevent the disease, what we need to do is to reduce R 0 below 1. According to Figs. 2-4, we can do this by improving the efficiency of the media and education implemented, timely reporting new infectious cases emerging in another neighboring region as well as the local region, and teaching the residents to adopt necessary measures. However, there are some limitations of our model: (i) we use mean-field theory to describe the interactions between the susceptibles and infected individuals without explicitly considering the network topology such as assortative or disassortative, clustering [26] ; (ii) we use a maximum degree n such that the ODE approximation has the same dynamics as the stochastic process if N/n is large [40] . We emphasize that this preliminary work does not consider the factors of edges rewiring, but only focuses on the case in which the media coverage reduces the transmission rate between susceptible and infected individuals. We can generalize the current model in many aspects. For example, a susceptible individual may cut its links to an infected individual and rewire those links once the information he/she receives due to media coverage reaches a certain threshold [41] ; or we could consider a multiplex network with two layers [42] , in which one is the disease transmission network and the other is the information transmission network, but the two networks have different topologies. These and some other related issues are very good topics on networks, which deserves further exploration.",
