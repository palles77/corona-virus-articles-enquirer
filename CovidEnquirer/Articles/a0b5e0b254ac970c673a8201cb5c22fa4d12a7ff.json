We report a monoclonal antibody (FVM04) that targets a uniquely exposed epitope within the RBS; cross-neutralizes Ebola (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), and, to a lesser extent, Bundibugyo viruses; and shows protection against EBOV and SUDV in mice and guinea pigs. The antibody cocktail ZMapp TM is remarkably effective against EBOV (Zaire) but does not cross-neutralize other ebolaviruses. By replacing one of the ZMapp TM components with FVM04, we retained the anti-EBOV efficacy while extending the breadth of protection to SUDV, thereby generating a cross-protective antibody cocktail. In addition, we report several mutations at the base of the ebolavirus glycoprotein that enhance the binding of FVM04 and other cross-reactive antibodies. These findings have important implications for pan-ebolavirus vaccine development and defining broadly protective antibody cocktails.",

Single-particle electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions of GP complexed with individual ZMappTM components (c2G4, c4G7, and c13C6) revealed two sites of vulnerability on the EBOV GP and elucidated the structural basis for their remarkable efficacy (Murin et al., 2014) . Of the three components of ZMapp TM , c2G4 and c4G7 target an epitope shared with KZ52 at the ''base'' of the chalice near the interface of GP1 and GP2, whereas c13C6 binds to a highly glycosylated domain on the top of a GP molecule known as the glycan cap (Davidson et al., 2015; Murin et al., 2014) .",

Although the epitopes engaged by EBOV-specific KZ52 and SUDV-specific 16F6 overlap by ten residues (Dias et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2008) , these base binders do not crossreact with other ebolaviruses. Neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor-binding site (RBS) have been described for several viruses, including influenza (Lee and Wilson, 2015) , HIV (Georgiev et al., 2013) , SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronaviruses (Coughlin and Prabhakar, 2012), and Chikungunya virus (van Duijl-Richter et al., 2015) . However, no neutralizing antibodies have been identified that would target the RBS within the ebolavirus glycoproteins. The filovirus RBS consists of a relatively exposed hydrophilic ''crest'' and a hydrophobic ''trough'' that is exposed on marburgvirus but occluded by the glycan cap in EBOV GP Wang et al., 2016) . RBS-binding mAbs were recently identified for marburgvirus and shown to bind to the RBS trough . Some of these antibodies also bind to EBOV GP but only after the glycan cap is proteolytically removed by thermolysin , a process that mimics the cathepsin-mediated cleavage in endosomes . In contrast, no antibodies have been reported to date that bind the prominent crest region of the RBS.",

In contrast to the base binders, these antibodies all bind, to the apex of the GP trimer, either the inner chalice or the glycan cap. Here, we report that one of these mAbs, FVM04, binds to the tip of the RBS crest and blocks the interaction of EBOV GP with its endosomal receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC-1). EM reconstructions of FVM04 complexed with EBOV GP show a unique asymmetric mode of engagement with a single antibody per trimer. FVM04 neutralizes EBOV, SUDV, and, to a lesser extent, BDBV and protects mice and guinea pigs from lethal challenge with EBOV and SUDV. Furthermore, replacement of one of the base binders in ZMapp TM with FVM04 retains the potency of the cocktail toward EBOV while expanding the protective breadth of the cocktail to include SUDV.",

One of these mAbs (FVM04) neutralized both EBOV and SUDV and showed significant efficacy in mice when administered at two doses, one on the day of challenge and one 3 dpi (Keck et al., 2015) . Our studies suggested that FVM04 targets a conformational epitope shared among all ebolaviruses with a low level of cross-reactivity to MARV (Keck et al., 2015) . In order to define the FVM04 epitope, we used an alanine scanning approach, where FVM04 binding was evaluated against a ''shotgun mutagenesis'' mutation library of EBOV GP with 641 of 644 target residues individually mutated. Human HEK293T cells were transfected with the entire library in a 384-well array format (one clone per well; Figure 1A ) and assessed for reactivity to FVM04 by high-throughput flow cytometry.",

Alanine substitutions at these residues reduced FVM04 binding to 29%, 1%, and 2% of wild-type, respectively, suggesting that these residues constitute key contact sites for FVM04, with D117 and G118 having the greatest energetic contribution to FVM04 binding ( Figures 1B and 1C ). In contrast, binding of two other panebolavirus antibodies FVM02 and FVM09 (Keck et al., 2015) was not affected by these mutations ( Figure 1C ). The putative epitope of FVM04 is positioned in a previously described region with a crest-and-trough morphology (Bornholdt et al., 2016; Hashiguchi et al., 2015) within the RBS and constitutes the tip of the hydrophilic crest (red dotted outline in Figure 1D ), which interacts with a loop from the endosomal filovirus receptor NPC1 (Wang et al., 2016) . In contrast to this exposed tip of the crest, the trough is lined with hydrophobic residues and occluded by the b14-b15 loop within the glycan cap (black dotted outline in Figure 1D ). This occlusion explains why trough-binding mAbs do not bind and neutralize EBOV unless the glycan cap is removed by proteolysis . Interestingly, while FVM04 binds well to EBOV GP, this binding was moderately enhanced by alanine substitution of N238, T240, N257, T259, N268, and T270, mutations that delete three out of four glycosylation sites on the glycan cap ( Figure S1 ), suggesting that these glycans may modestly interfere with FVM04 binding. Nonetheless, these data show that FVM04 represents a prototypic pan-ebolavirus antibody that recognizes a uniquely exposed epitope within the RBS.",

In contrast, FVM04 appears to bind the apex of the trimer, between the glycan cap and the trimer center (Figure 2A ), therefore representing a distinct class of neutralizing antibodies. In addition to epitope-mapping information (loss-of-function analysis), the alanine-scanning experiments revealed a striking difference between the GP-binding patterns of these ''base-binding'' and ''apex-binding'' classes of neutralizers. While the binding of the base binder KZ52 to all individual mutants remained consistently below 150% of wild-type GP ( Figure 2B ), several single-alanine mutations of GP had a dramatic enhancing effect (as high as 200%-300%) on FVM04 binding ( Figure 2C ). Out of 217 amino acids forming the base, alanine mutation of 23 residues increased FVM04 binding to GP by more than 2-fold ( Figure 2C ; Table S1 ). Most of these residues are hydrophobic, highly networked, and not surface exposed ( Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). In addition to the 23 base residues, mutation of R498 and R501, within the furin cleavage site separating GP1 and GP2 (Volchkov et al., 1998) , also led Human HEK293T cells expressing the mutation library were tested for reactivity to mAbs using an Intellicyt flow cytometer. A typical reactivity pattern (red wells) is shown for a representative assay plate. Eight positive (wild-type EBOV GP) and eight negative (mock-transfected) control wells were included on each plate. (B) The library was tested for reactivity with FVM04. Clones with <30% binding relative to that of wild-type (WT) EBOV GP yet >65% reactivity for a control mAb were initially identified to be critical for FVM04 binding. (C) Mutation of three individual residues reduced FVM04 binding (red bars) but had little effect on the binding of FVM02 and FVM09 (gray bars; Keck et al., 2015) .

The class averages suggest that only one FVM04 Fab binds to each GP trimer (Figures 3A and 3B; Figure S3 ). The binding of one FVM04 Fab per trimer was also further confirmed by size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis ( Figure S4 ). It is likely that the binding orientation and proximity to the 3-fold axis precludes additional FVM04 Fabs from binding. In contrast, the previously characterized glycancap-binding antibody c13C6, which binds in a nearby region to FVM04, has a greater occupancy (two to three Fabs per GP trimer) (Murin et al., 2014 ) ( Figure 3C ). Although several attempts were made to generate a 3D reconstruction of FVM04 binding to GP, the data failed to converge on an interpretable model, suggesting that the crest epitope is flexible.",

These assays included replication-incompetent vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSVs) pseudotyped with filovirus GP and expressing Luciferase (VSV-GP-Luc), as well as replication-competent VSV pseudotypes expressing GFP (VSV-GP-GFP) and wild-type live virus. While the first assay identifies only direct-entry inhibitors, antibodies inhibiting either the entry or other stages of viral replication can be identified by the second assay or live virus. As shown in Figure 4A , FVM04 effectively neutralized the entry of both VSV-pseudotyped EBOV and SUDV, with half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of 3.4 and 4.3 mg/ml, respectively. We also examined whether the FVM04 neutralization is dependent on bivalent binding of full immunoglobulin (Ig) G or whether FVM04 Fab fragment would also mediate neutralization. EBOV entry was effectively inhibited by FVM04 Fab with an EC 50 similar to that of full IgG; however, the neutralizing potency of FVM04 Fab toward SUDV was reduced compared to that of full IgG ( Figure 4B ). FVM04 also effectively neutralized replication-competent VSV pseudotyped with EBOV or SUDV but not TAFV ( Figure 4C ). While FVM04 showed low neutralizing activity toward VSV-BDBV GP-GFP, this neutralization plateaued at 50%, leaving a non-neutralized subset of infectious virions remaining ( Figure 4C ). We further tested the neutralizing activity of FVM04 against authentic (wild-type) EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV, using a plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assay under BioSafety Level 4 (BSL-4) containment. The highest neutralizing activity was observed against SUDV, while 3-to 4-fold and 20-to 30-fold higher concentrations of FVM04 were required to effectively neutralize wild-type EBOV and BDBV, respectively ( Figure 4D ). As expected, FVM04 did not neutralize MARV ( Figure 4D ).",

To this end, we tested whether the crest binder FVM04 could also neutralize the endosomal form of the virus and whether proteolytic removal of the glycan cap and mucinlike domain (MLD) impacts its neutralizing potency. As shown in Figure 4E , FVM04 neutralized both VSV-EBOV GP CL and VSV-SUDV GP CL nearly 100-fold more effectively than the VSV expressing full-length GP (compare with Figure 4C ), suggesting that cathepsin cleavage may further expose the FVM04-binding site. Conversely, no increase in the partial neutralization of BDBV by FVM04 was observed upon thermolysin cleavage ( Figure 4E ).",

FVM04 was bound to protein G sensors and exposed to a range of GPDTM concentrations ( Figure 5 ). The association and dissociation of FVM04 to EBOV and SUDV GPDTM fit a 1:1 binding model ( Figures 5A and 5B ). The K D for EBOV GPDTM was calculated to be 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 nM, with a k a (association rate) of (2.5 \u00b1 0.1) 3 10 4 /M sec and a k d (dissociation rate) of (5.4 \u00b1 0.1) 3 10 \u00c05 /s. The affinity of FVM04 for SUDV GPDTM was slightly higher, with a K D of 9.1 \u00b1 0.2 nM, a k a of (6.0 \u00b1 0.1) 3 10 4 /M sec, and a k d of (5.4 \u00b1 0.1) 3 10 \u00c04 /s. The affinity of FVM04 to EBOV and SUDV GPDTM was also analyzed in an additional experiment using anti-human Fc-coated sensors, and the K D values were found to be similar. Interestingly, the binding of FVM04 to BDBV GPDTM was best described with a 2:1 binding model, with two dissociation constants of K D 1 = 570 \u00b1 50 nM and K D 2 = 31 \u00b1 1 nM ( Figure 5C ). The initial association with FVM04 is within the same range of EBOV GPDTM and SUDV GPDTM, with a k a 1 of (3.8 \u00b1 0.1) 3 10 4 /M sec, but the second association step is 4-fold slower, with a k a 2 of (1.1 \u00b1 0.1) 3 10 4 /M sec. The dissociation rate of BDBV GPDTM from FVM04 is the fastest among all three proteins, with a k d 1 of (2.2 \u00b1 0.1) 3 10 \u00c02 /s, and a k d 2 of (3.3 \u00b1 0.1) 3 10 \u00c04 /s. Collectively, this kinetics analysis offers a biophysical explanation for the differential neutralization profiles between the three viruses. FVM04 exhibits potent neutralization of both EBOV and SUDV, consistent with a high affinity for both glycoproteins in vitro (nanomolar range, K D ), but only a modest neutralization activity against BDBV consistent with poorer binding profiles toward this GP. The difference in binding between EBOV/SUDV and BDBV GP is most evident in the biphasic dissociation phase for BDBV, which is dominated by a dissociation rate (k d ) that is two orders of magnitude faster than for EBOV or SUDV GP.",

Here, we expanded these studies to post-exposure treatment in both the EBOV model and a recently developed mouse model for SUDV . First, we evaluated the delayed administration of a single dose of FVM04. Groups of ten mice were infected with 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) of mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV) (Bray et al., 1999) and treated with a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 10 mg/kg (200 mg per mouse) of FVM04 either 1, 2, or 3 dpi. A single injection of FVM04 at 1 dpi led to full protection from lethal challenge (p < 0.0001; determined by Manel-Cox method), while delayed treatment on day 2 or day 3 (peak of viremia) resulted in 80% (p = 0.0012) and 30% (p = 0.108) protection, respectively ( Figure 6A ). Consistent with survival data, mice treated at 1 dpi showed no weight loss or sign of disease ( Figure 6A ). Mice treated on 2 or 3 dpi lost a maximum of 8% and 10% body weight, respectively, compared to 18% weight loss in the control group, and milder clinical signs of disease were observed ( Figure 6A ). Then, we evaluated the dose response by treating the mice 2 dpi with 10, 5, or 2.5 mg/kg (200, 100, or 50 mg per mouse) of FVM04 or PBS as control. In this study, both 10 and 5 mg/kg FVM04 provided full protection (p < 0.0001), while 70% of the mice receiving 2.5 mg/kg survived the challenge (p = 0.0004) (Figure 6B ). PBS-treated mice lost about 13% of their body weight before succumbing to infection, while mice treated with FVM04 showed less weight loss and less severe disease, as determined by health scores ( Figure 6B ). These data clearly indicate the post-exposure efficacy of FVM04 at relatively low doses.",

A single injection of FVM04 protected all guinea pigs from GPA-SUDV challenge, while the controls succumbed to infection within 10-13 days (p = 0.0004) ( Figure 7A ). While the controls lost up to 40% body weight after the GPA-SUDV challenge, no weight loss or sign of disease was observed among FVM04-treated animals (Figure 7A ). All DPBS-treated guinea pigs infected with GPA-EBOV succumbed to infection within 6-7 days, while two out of six FVM04-treated animals survived the challenge, and the remaining died between 9 and 11 dpi (p = 0.0012) ( Figure 7B ). The median survival was 7 days for the control group and 11 days for the FVM04-treated group.

ZMapp TM , consisting of the two base binders c2G4 and c4G7 and the glycan cap binder c13C6, was selected for testing in NHPs based on significant, but partial, protection in guinea pigs (four out of six) when administered once at 3 dpi . Based on the aforementioned study, we hypothesized that replacing one of the ZMapp TM components with FVM04 would lead to an effective EBOV cocktail that is also protective against SUDV. We selected the mAb c4G7 to be replaced, since it binds to an epitope closely overlapping the c2G4 epitope Davidson et al., 2015; Murin et al., 2014 ). First, we tested whether FVM04 alone (5 mg) or a cocktail of c2G4/c13C6/cFVM04 (1.6 mg each) would protect against GPA-SUDV when administered at 3 dpi. While all GPA-SUDV-infected control animals died within 10-14 days, all FVM04-treated animals and five out of six animals treated with the cocktail survived the challenge ( Figure 7C ). The protection was highly significant, with p = 0.0008 for both treatment groups compared with the controls. Animals treated with FVM04 exhibited no weight loss, while control animals lost an average of 25% body weight ( Figure 7C ). While the animals treated with the cocktail also showed no weight loss on average ( Figure 7C ), the only fatal case in this group lost 17% of its body weight before dying on day 14 post-infection.",

This outbreak reached unprecedented dimensions, despite the fact that the majority of efforts to develop vaccines and therapeutics over the past decade was focused on the same ebolavirus that caused this epidemic. Given the uncertainties about the natural reservoir and the zoonotic dynamics of filoviruses, it is impossible to predict the species or location of future outbreaks. Thus, broadly protective vaccines and therapeutics are urgently needed to cope with this emerging threat. Recent reports indicate that mAbs against GP are effective as post-exposure treatments for ebolavirus hemorrhagic fever (Pettitt et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2014) . ZMapp TM , a cocktail of three mAbs against EBOV GP, is among the most advanced therapeutic candidates and has exhibited remarkable efficacy in symptomatic EBOV-infected NHPs . However, these immunotherapeutic candidates are species specific and mostly target EBOV (Zaire) only.",

Recently, engineered bispecific antibodies targeting the GP base of both EBOV and SUDV were shown to provide post-exposure protection in mice (Frei et al., 2016) . Despite the structural overlap of 16F6 (SUDV-specific) and KZ52 (EBOV-specific) to date, no cross-binding antibody that targets the GP base epitope on a canonical IgG framework has been described. Thus, antibody cocktails with expanded neutralizing and protective breadth are likely to engage novel epitopes. We have recently identified a set of pan-ebolavirus and pan-filovirus mAbs that target phylogenetically conserved sites within the glycan cap and core GP1, including two mAbs (m8C4 and FVM04) that effectively crossneutralize EBOV and SUDV, the two most divergent filoviruses (Holtsberg et al., 2015; Keck et al., 2015) . Here, we report full characterization of the pan-ebolavirus mAb FVM04 and demonstrate that it targets a uniquely exposed epitope within the RBS and conveys post-exposure protection against both EBOV and SUDV.",

The recessed trough is occluded by specific interaction of residues from the glycan cap, with the hydrophobic lining of the trough blocking its accessibility on the surface of EBOV GP .

Moreover, the recently solved X-ray crystal structure of a GP CL -NPC-1 domain C protein complex reveals that a loop in NPC1 domain C directly contacts the basic crest (Wang et al., 2016) . Here, we show that FVM04 binding specifically blocks the interaction of GP CL with NPC-1. Lately, Corti et al. (2016) also reported an EBOV-specific antibody that binds to the EBOV GP glycan cap and the RBS region and blocks GP interaction with NPC-1 . Thus, FVM04 represents a distinct cross-neutralizing antibody that binds an exposed epitope within the ebolavirus RBS and neutralizes the virus, at least in part, through blockade of receptor interaction.",

While FVM04 effectively neutralized both EBOV and SUDV, it only exhibited partial neutralization of BDBV. Our previous results indicated that FVM04 binds to BDBV GP with an ELISA EC 50 comparable to those of EBOV and SUDV (Keck et al., 2015) . However, our kinetic analysis in this report showed that FVM04 has a very rapid off rate for BDBV GP, providing a possible explanation for low neutralizing activity toward BDBV. The amino acid sequence of the EBOV and BDBV GP crest regions only differ in positions 112 (glutamic acid in EBOV versus aspartic acid in BDBV) and 116 (proline in EBOV versus alanine in BDBV). In our alanine-scanning analysis, the E112A and P116A mutations in EBOV GP did not alter the binding to FVM04 (106% and 115% of wild-type respectively). However, it is possible that the residues 112 and 116 influence the positioning of the key residues 115, 117, and 118 or are part of the epitope directly but at a lower energetic level that cannot be captured by the cell-surface staining assay. FVM04 did not neutralize VSV pseudotyped with TAFV GP, which also differs from EBOV GP in the same crest residues as BDBV with alanine and valine in positions 112 and 116, respectively. Nonetheless, FVM04 is an effective neutralizer of the most virulent ebolaviruses EBOV and SUDV.",

Class averages from the analysis of negative-stain EM of FVM04 Fab bound to GPDMuc revealed that it binds with a stoichiometry of one Fab per trimer. The position of FVM04 in EM studies is consistent with the mutational analysis. Together, these results suggest that this mAb binds with a more angled pose than c13C6, which binds at the top of GP as well but perpendicular to the plane of the viral membrane (Murin et al., 2014) . Although we have not quantitatively established with solution studies that only a single FVM04 Fab is capable of binding, even at saturating concentrations, it seems reasonable from the EM-derived images that the angle of approach for a single FVM04 Fab occludes the other potential binding sites on the other two subunits. Further studies are required to elucidate the implications of this binding morphology on neutralization and in vivo efficacy, but a tantalizing possibility is that fewer FVM04 IgG molecules bind the GP trimer than other IgGs on average. Lower requirement for occupancy could, in theory, provide a therapeutic advantage because less antibody would be required for neutralization and render the IgG less susceptible to decoy antigens such as sGP or GP spike on defective particles. For example, studies performed with anti-EBOV equine Ig clearly showed rapid reduction in EBOV-specific equine IgG titer during the peak of viremia in NHPs, while total equine IgG titer remained constant (Jahrling et al., 1996) , suggesting high antibody consumption during infection. Single-site occupancy could also potentially leave more of the GP surface exposed in the mAb-GP complex, providing additional opportunities for engagement of other epitopes by other antibodies in a cocktail.",

Interestingly, our mutagenesis studies revealed that, in contrast to KZ52, binding of FVM04 was substantially enhanced when certain residues within the base of the GP (GP2 and N terminus of GP1) were mutated to alanine. Most of these mutations also increased binding of other crossreactive antibodies that we had previously reported (Holtsberg et al., 2015; Keck et al., 2015) , such as 4B8, m8C4, FVM09, and FVM20. These residues are mostly hydrophobic and buried in the structure, suggesting that single-point mutations within the base may loosen up the apex, exposing cross-reactive epitopes. This finding may have important implications for the development of pan-ebolavirus vaccines if such mutations can be incorporated into vaccines to improve their potency or breadth of protection.",

This suggests that FVM04 alone may be sufficient to control SUDV infection. To date, no SUDV antibodies have been tested in NHP studies; thus, it is not known how protection in rodent models relates to efficacy against SUDV in NHPs. In contrast, in the EBOV guinea pig model, a protection level of more than $60%, 3 dpi, at a total dose of 5 mg is a good indicator of efficacy in NHPs. In fact, the ZMapp TM cocktail that fully protected NHPs at 5 dpi was selected based on partial efficacy at 3 dpi in guinea pigs . In the GPA-EBOV-infected guinea pigs, FVM04 protected two out of six animals when administered at 1 dpi. While the protection level of 33% was statistically significant, it was lower than the reported protection level of 60% at 1 dpi afforded by c2G4 or c4G7 (Qiu et al., 2012b) . These data suggested that, while FVM04 alone may be sufficient for SUDV, more efficient protection against EBOV would require a cocktail. Given that c2G4 and c4G7 target overlapping epitopes (Murin et al., 2014) , we reasoned that 4G7 may be a good candidate for replacement by FVM04. This led to a cocktail of FVM04/c2G4/c13C6 that protected five out of six guinea pigs against SUDV and four out of six animals against EBOV. This level of protection against EBOV is comparable with historical efficacy data of ZMapp TM ( Figure 7E ) . These data demonstrate that a cocktail of FVM04, c13C6, and c2G4, is as effective as ZMapp TM against EBOV while expanding the breadth of protection to include SUDV. The efficacy of these cocktails must be further tested in future NHP studies; however, these data position FVM04 as a strong candidate to be a component of a pan-ebolavirus therapeutic cocktail.",

Clones were individually arrayed into 384-well plates, transfected into HEK293T cells, and allowed to express for 22 hr. Cells were incubated with primary antibody and then with an Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing, cellular fluorescence was detected using the Intellicyt high-throughput flow cytometer (Intellicyt). Background fluorescence was determined in vector-transfected control cells. mAb reactivity against each mutant GP clone was calculated relative to wild-type GP reactivity by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls and normalizing to the signal from wild-type GP-transfected controls. Mutated residues within clones were identified as critical to a test mAb epitope if they did not support reactivity of the mAb but did support the reactivity of other control EBOV mAbs. This counter-screen facilitates the exclusion of GP mutants that are locally misfolded or have an expression defect. The detailed algorithms used to interpret shotgun mutagenesis data are described elsewhere (patent application 61/938,894; Davidson and Doranz, 2014) .",

HEK293T cells (80% confluency) were transfected with plasmids encoding EBOV GP, MARV GP, or SUDV GP using Fugene HD (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The next day, these cells were infected with rVSV-DGP pseudotype (Kerafast) at an MOI of 3, and the virus was washed off after 1 hr with DPBS. The next day, the supernatant was collected and clarified by centrifugation. To titer the pseudotyped virus, BHK-21 cells were transfected in six-well plates with pCAGGS VSV-G (Kerafast), and after 48 hr, serial dilution of VSV-EBOV-GP-Luc or VSV-SUDV-GP-Luc pseudotype was added to each well for 1 hr before the addition of 0.9% agar in DMEM. The next day, wells were fixed with 5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min before removing the agar and staining with crystal violet to count the plaques. The details of the luciferase assay for the determination of VSV-GP-Luc infectivity were previously described (Keck et al., 2015) . Data were fit to a 4PL curve using GraphPad Prism 6. Percent neutralization was calculated based on wells containing virus only. rVSV GP-GFP Assay rVSVs expressing EGFP, as well as EBOV or MARV GP in place of VSV-G, were described previously Ng et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2010) . rVSVs bearing TAFV, SUDV GP, or BDBV GPDMuc were generated by the same method. VSV particles containing cleaved GP (GP CL ) were generated by incubating rVSV-GPs with thermolysin (200 mg/ml) for 1 hr at 37 C, followed by treatment with phosphoramidon (1 mM), and reaction mixtures were used immediately. Infectivity of rVSVs was measured by counting EGFP-positive cells at 12-14 hr post-infection using a CellInsight CX5 automated microscope and onboard software (Thermo Scientific). For neutralization experiments, serial dilutions of mAbs were incubated with the rVSV-GP for 1 hr at room temperature. Monolayers of Vero cells seeded in 96-well plates were inoculated with the mAb-virus mixture in triplicate and then incubated at 37 C overnight. Infection was scored 12 hr to 16 hr post-infection by the enumeration of eGFP + cells and normalized to no-antibody control taken to represent 100%.",
