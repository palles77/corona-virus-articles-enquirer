Many viruses that are cytocidal in cultured cells are harm less in vivo (e.g., many enteroviruses), whereas some that are noncytocidal in vitro cause a lethal disease in vivo (e.g., rabies virus). A great deal of cell and tissue damage can occur without producing signs of disease, e.g., a large number of intestinal or liver cells can be destroyed without significant clinical signs. Even when damage to cells impairs the function of an organ or tissue, this may be of minor importance, e.g., in muscle or subcutaneous tissue, but of great importance in the heart or the brain. Likewise, edema of a tissue may be unimportant in most sites in the body but may have serious consequences in the brain, because of the resulting increase in intracranial pressure, or in the lung, where it may interfere with gaseous exchange, or in the heart, where it may interfere with conduction.",

These cytolytic reactions occur when antibody, having combined with viral antigen on the cell surface, activates the complement system, lead ing to cell lysis. Alternatively, antibodies can sensitize virus-infected cells to destruction by K cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or mac rophages, via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. While it has been clearly demonstrated that virus-infected cells are readily lysed by all of these mechanisms in vitro, their significance in viral diseases in vivo is unclear, although there is some evidence that they may be oper ative in certain herpes virus infections.",

If the reaction occurs in extra vascular tissues there is edema, inflammation, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which may later be replaced by mononuclear cells. This is a common cause of mild inflammatory reactions. These \"immune com plex\" reactions constitute the classical Arthus response, and are of major importance, especially in persistent viral infections. If they occur in the blood, they produce circulating immune complexes, which are found in many viral infections, both acute and persistent. The fate of the immune complexes depends on the ratio of antibody to antigen. If there is a large excess of antibody, each antigen molecule is covered with antibody and removed by macrophages, which have receptors for the Fc fragment of the antibody molecule. If the amounts of antigen and antibody are about equal, lattice structures which develop into large aggregates are formed and removed rapidly by the reticuloendothelial system. However, in some persistent infections viral antigens or virions them selves are continuously released into the blood, but the antibody re sponse is weak and antibodies are of low avidity. Complexes continue to be deposited in glomeruli over periods of weeks, months, or even years, leading to impairment of glomerular filtration and eventually to chronic glomerulonephritis (see Chapter 11). A classic example is lymphocytic choriomeningitis infection in mice infected in utero or as neonates. Viral antigens are present in the blood and small amounts of nonneutralizing antibody are formed, giving rise to immune complexes which are pro gressively deposited upon renal glomerular membranes. Depending on the strain of mouse, the end result may be glomerulonephritis, uremia, and death. Circulating immune complexes may also be deposited in the walls of the small blood vessels in skin, joints, and choroid plexus, where they attract macrophages and activate complement. Prodromal rashes, seen commonly in exanthems in humans but rarely in domestic animals, are probably caused in this way.",

After intracerebral inoculation this noncytocidal virus replicates harmlessly in the m\u00e9ninges, ependyma, and choroid plexus epithelium until about the seventh day, when a T c lymphocyte-mediated immune response occurs, causing severe meningitis, cerebral edema, and death. Elsewhere than in the central nervous system, T c cells help to control infection; within the rigid confines of the skull these changes are fatal.

Some times endocrine epithelial cells affected by noncytocidal viruses are not killed, but their secretory functions are damaged; e.g., infection of mice with encephalomyocarditis virus (a picornavirus) may lead to diabetes because of the action of the virus on the \u00df cells of the islets of Lan gerhans.

Drop lets of different sizes alight at different levels of the respiratory tree, and infection may accordingly be initiated at particular levels, but in general the upper respiratory tract-i.e., the nasal passages, the pharynx, and the trachea-are the sites of initial infection. Immediately upon alight ing, the virus is met by host defense mechanisms; if the animal has previously been infected with the same or a very similar strain of influ enza virus, antibody (mainly IgA) present in the mucus may neutralize the virus. Mucus also contains gly copro teins similar to the receptor mol ecules on respiratory epithelial cells; these glycoproteins may combine with virions and prevent them from attaching to epithelial cells.

The Pasteurella species involved are always present in the environment and in the upper respiratory tract of cattle, and it is not likely that they could be eliminated. Likewise, these bacterial species have proved most diffi cult to affect with vaccines. The speed with which antibiotic therapy is initiated does influence the eventual outcome, but in many cases irrepa rable damage has already been done by the time of diagnosis. If microcolonies have been established and have progressed to abscess forma tion, there is added difficulty in delivering effective antibiotic levels so as to reach the bacteria. Even when the animal does not die, it generally does not grow well, and it is prone to further debilitating diseases. Viral vaccine programs, aimed at preventing this pathogenetic pattern, must be measured and justified indirectly, by the effect they have on pneu monia prevalence. Producers and veterinarians must therefore collabo rate in developing overall strategies for dealing with this syndrome.",

In viral infections fluid loss is mainly a loss of extracellular fluid due to impaired absorption, and osmotic loss due primarily to the presence of undigested lactose in the lumen (in sucking animals), rather than active secretion. As virus destroys the absorptive cells there is a loss of those enzymes responsible for the digestion of disaccharides, and the loss of differentiated cells diminishes glucose, sodium carrier, and Na + ,K+-ATPase activities. This leads to a loss of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and water, and the development of acidosis. Another cause of acidosis is the result of increased microbial activity associated with the fermentation of undigested milk. Acidosis can create a K+ ion exchange across the cellular membrane, affecting cellular functions that maintain the normal potassium concentration. Hypoglycernia due to decreased intestinal absorption, inhibited glyconeogenesis, and increased glycolysis follow, completing a complex of pathophysiological changes that if not promptly corrected results in death of the animal.",

Susceptibility decreases rapidly with increasing age; the viral diar rheas are essentially diseases of the first few weeks of life. To prevent infection of newborn animals, antibody must be present continuously in the lumen of the gut. This does not continue for more than about 7 days unless the dam is hyperimmunized against the common etiological agents.

No antibody is found on the seventh day, but in some dogs the titer reaches 1:100 or higher on the eighth or ninth day. In such animals there is no further spread of virus, and virus disappears rapidly from the lymphatic tissues; the infection remains subclinical. If measurable antibody is not present on the ninth day or a titer of 1:100 has not been attained by the fourteenth day, virus spreads throughout the body. As well as continued infection of mononuclear cells in the lymphatic system, extensive infection of the epithelium in the intestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts, skin, and exocrine and endocrine glands occurs. Infection of the gastrointestinal tract causes vomiting and diarrhea, infection of the respiratory tract causes bron chitis and sometimes pneumonia, and infection of the skin is associated with dermatitis. The brain is sometimes infected, usually when infection in visceral organs is subsiding. The virus appears first in meningeal macrophages and mononuclear cells in perivascular adventitia and later in ependymal cells, glial cells, and neurons. The infection of neurons is associated with behavioral changes, local myoclony, tonic-clonic spasms, and paresis, which often persist after recovery. Forty to sixty days after apparent recovery, some dogs suffer from postinfection encephalitis, with charac teristic demyelination, often leading to death. In these dogs, high titers of neutralizing antibody occur in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid. In addition, very occasionally dogs that have recovered from distemper suffer from encephalitis years later-\"old dog encephalitis.\" Like subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in humans who have recovered from measles, this appears to be due to the very slow replication and spread of distemper virus in the brain. This complication, like acute canine dis temper itself, has become more rare as distemper vaccination has become more general.",

In the nervous system most virus is assembled upon cytoplasmic membranes within cells; the cells are not lysed, so that little viral antigen is released to stimulate host defense mechanisms. In the salivary gland, however, virions bud almost exclusively from plasma membranes at the luminal surface of mucous cells and are released in high concentrations into the saliva (Plate 10-3).

            "text": "The pathogenesis of rabies is remarkable in that invasion, spread to the central nervous system, and the development of signs occur with mimimal immunological responses, yet even after infection has oc curred, early administration of antibody and/or vaccine can often pre vent disease.Infection by the bite of a rabid animal usually results in deposition of rabies-infected saliva deep in the striated muscles, but rabies can occur, albeit with less certainty, after superficial abrasion of the skin. Initially virus replicates in the muscle cells or cells of the subepithelial tissues until it has reached a sufficient concentration to reach motor or sensory nerve endings in the muscle or skin. Here it appears to bind specifically to the acetylcholine receptor or other receptors and enters nerve end ings. This begins the second phase of infection, in which neuronal infec tion and centripetal passive movement of viral nucleic acid within axons leads to involvement of the central nervous system. The incubation period-i.e., the time between the infective bite and the development of signs of central nervous system involvement-is usually between 14 and 90 days, but may occasionally be much longer, possibly because virus remains sequestered in striated muscle cells before entering pe ripheral nerves and ascending to the brain.Although rabies proteins are highly antigenic, neither humoral nor cell-mediated responses occur during the stage of movement of virus from the site of the bite to the central nervous system, probably because very little antigen is delivered to the immune system; most is seques tered in muscle cells or within nerve axons. However, this early stage of infection is accessible to antibody and the classical Pasteurian postinfection vaccination (especially with the additional administration of hyperimmune immunoglobulin). Immunological intervention is effective dur ing the long incubation period because of a delay between the initial viral replication in muscle cells and the entry of virus into the protected environment of the nervous system. Movement along the nerves eventually delivers virus to the central nervous system, usually the spinal cord initially. An ascending wave of neuronal infection and neuronal dysfunction then occurs. Virus reaches the limbic system, where it replicates extensively, and the release of cortical control of behavior leads to \"furious\" rabies. Spread within the central nervous system continues, and when replication occurs in the neocortex the clinical picture changes to \"dumb\" rabies. Depression, coma, and death from respiratory arrest follow.However, before this-and, indeed, coincidentally with its replication in the limbic system that leads to fury-virus moves centrifugally from PLATE 10-3.
