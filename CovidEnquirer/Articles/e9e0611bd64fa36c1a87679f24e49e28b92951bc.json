These data have led to the suggestion that chloroquine and its derivatives be used in persons with EBOV infection because this drug is approved for use in humans, has an extensive safety profile, and is inexpensive (1, 9) . To determine whether protection would extend to the EBOV hamster model, during 2013-2014 we investigated chloroquine treatment in this model and attempted to repeat previous in vitro findings and findings in the mouse model.",

Analysis of the data from day 5 resulted in an EC 50 of 1.77 \u03bcg/mL and an EC 90 of 23.34 \u03bcg/mL, concentrations that are comparable with previous data (8) ; however, reductions in viral loads at these concentrations at other time points were negligible. Although concentrations of >50 \u03bcg/mL of chloroquine reduced viral loads by 2-4 logs starting on day 3, this decrease was accompanied by a high level of cytotoxicity (>50%) that was evident both in the cytotoxicity assay and microscopically resulting in poor selectivity of chloroquine.",

Thus, broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs were proposed to help in this regard. In this study, no toxicity was observed in the mock-challenged group as a result of the combination treatment. This finding suggests that hamsters tolerate this dose of chloroquine.

In the hamsters, this dose was already lethal on its own. In the hamster model at a lower dose (50 mg/kg) combined with doxycycline and azithromycin-which together provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage, in addition to doxycycline having a small antiviral effect against EBOV-survival did not change. Previous anecdotal reports of the incidental use of chloroquine in patients with filovirus infections also do not support any benefit from its use (13, 14) .
