For example, unsanitary conditions led to a huge increase in the rat population in post-war Kosovo, resulting in a tularemia outbreak with 327 confirmed cases in 8 months. 2 Regional conflict leads to breakdown in infection control, inadequate surveillance, impeded access to populations, and spread of infectious diseases through movement of refugees and aid workers. 3 Climate change increases the risk of infectious diseases by many mechanisms. Mosquito populations will increase where they already exist. Mosquitoes and other arthropod vectors will migrate to new habitats where warmer climate is conducive to their survival. For vector-borne diseases to occur, only a host reservoir and a specific vector are necessary. If humans are the reservoir and the vector has been able to adapt to new locales, a previous zoonosis or confined disease has the potential to become a global disease. The emergence of West Nile virus infection in North America is the best example of vectors and/or amplifying hosts migrating to a new location.",

When a second outbreak occurs, there will be little information about the natural history of that particular infection in pregnant women. Obstetrician-gynecologists are often the only physicians a woman may see and, therefore, are in a unique position to detect unusual patterns of illness or novel diseases. 10 Pregnant women may have more severe illness in some emerging infectious diseases such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and the hemorrhagic fevers. An attempt to avoid radiographs and scans in pregnant patients may lead to diagnostic delays. Ciprofloxaxin is normally contraindicated in pregnancy because of studies suggesting joint and cartilage toxicity in juvenile animals from fluoroquinolones. Despite this data, during the anthrax attacks in 2001, the CDC recommended a 60 day course of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis for pregnant women who had a highrisk exposure. 11 The Second International Conference on Women and Infectious Disease was held in Atlanta in 2006. The conference underlined the need for accumulating gender-based information on infectious diseases. Monitoring pregnant women during outbreaks must become an integral part of public health investigations. If general guidelines exist for an emerging infectious disease outbreak, pre-event recommendations for prophylaxis and treatment of pregnant women must also be specifically provided, rather than cobbling together guidelines for these vulnerable women and their fetuses during an emergency.",

The emergence of henipaviruses has been linked to increased contact between bats and humans, paralleling the emergence of other zoonotic viruses such as SARS, coronavirus, Australian bat lyssavirus, Manangle virus, and probably Ebola and Marburg.

In 2005-2006 a major outbreak occurred in the Indian Ocean, starting in Kenya and moving to the Comoro Islands, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Madagascar, Mayotte, and Reunion and finally reaching India, where 1.4 million cases were reported. In some areas the attack rates reached 45%. Asymptomatic chikungunya infection was rare; almost everyone infected became ill. In Reunion, of 265 000 cases of chikungunya there were 237 deaths. Deaths were more common in the elderly and people with other underlying diseases. 21 More than 1000 European and American travelers to India during the epidemic returned home with chikungunya fever.

Six different species have been identified, but the majority of endocarditis cases are caused by B. quintana and B. henselae. 59 Body louse infestation, contact with cats, and underlying valvular heart disease are the major risk factors for Bartonella endocarditis. A predilection exists for the aortic valve. A high rate (60%) of valve replacement appears to be necessary. Most cases occur on native valves, but aggressive prosthetic valve endocarditis with rapid valve destruction has been reported. 60 Bacillary angiomatosis, first described in 1983 in HIVinfected patients and organ transplant recipients, is a vascular proliferative disease usually involving the skin, but also reported in liver, spleen, bone, brain, and other organs. Cutaneous lesions are papular, purple to red-black in color, and highly vascular. Both B. henselae and B. quintana have been identified as causative agents. 61 Bacillary angiomatosis occurs in advanced AIDS patients with a median CD4 lymphocyte count of \ue02c50 cells/microliter. 62 Disseminated, severe, progressive disease may also occur in patients with other forms of immunosuppressive disease or alcoholism.

Between 1995 and 2001 in the United States the proportion of MRSA isolates increased from 22% to 57% in over 24 000 cases of nosocomial S. aureus bacteremia. Nosocomial MRSA infections are responsible for longer hospital stays, higher mortality, and higher costs than patients with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). Risk factors for HA-MRSA infections include antibiotic use, surgery, intravenous devices, prosthetic devices such as artificial joints and heart valves, intensive care unit stays, hemodialysis, and exposure to other patients with MRSA. The most common mode of transmission of HA-MRSA is contaminated hands of healthcare workers. However, fomites such as stethoscope ear tips and surfaces proximate to infected patients can also serve as reservoirs. In one study, environmental surfaces had an MRSA contamination rate of 59% in the hospital rooms of patients with heavy gastrointestinal MRSA colonization and diarrhea. 82, 83 CA-MRSA infection is defined as MRSA infection in an individual without recent hospitalization, surgery, stay in a long-term care facility, dialysis, or indwelling medical devices. The first reports of CA-MRSA were reported in intravenous drug users in the early 1980s. 84 Based on molecular evidence, CA-MRSA strains evolved spontaneously rather than migrating from hospitals to communities. CA-MRSA differs from HA-MRSA in genetic makeup, increased pathogenicity, and antibiotic susceptibility. Most CA-MRSA strains in the United States encoded with the novel mecA gene sequence, which until recently, had not been present in HA-MRSA strains. MecA produces PBP2a, a penicillin-binding peptide that decreases beta-lactam affinity for MRSA. MecA is a subset of a larger mobile genetic element called staphylococcal chromosome cassette (SCCmec) which governs other differences between HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA. 85 While CA-MRSA usually retain their susceptibility to many non-beta-lactam agents, HA-MRSA strains do not. CA strains produce virulence factors and destructive toxins not commonly found in HA strains, particularly Panton-Valentine leukocidin. USA 300 and USA 400 are the predominant clones of CA-MRSA infections, with USA 300 most common. 86 In a population review in three communities, the annual incidence of CA-MRSA during 2001-2 was 18-25 per 100 000. Twenty-three percent of patients required hospitalization. CA-MRSA infections most often present with skin and soft tissue infections in young, healthy people who neither work nor have been in hospitals or other healthcare settings. 87 These organisms are usually sensitive to non-betalactam antibiotics.",

            "text": "In Ohio, Kentucky, and Vermont in 2004 and 2005 44 tattoo recipients from 13 unlicensed tattoo parlors developed CA-MRSA infections. Thirty-four cases were primary. Ten cases were secondary through direct contact with a primary case. Only one patient had hepatitis C; all the others had no underlying disease. Symptoms occurred 4-22 days after receiving the tattoo. Adherence to hygiene among the tattooists was poor. Three of the tattooists in Ohio had recently been in correctional facilities. Some tattooists used homemade equipment including guitar-string tattoo needles and computer ink-jet cartridges for dye. 94 The Los Angeles County Jail is the largest jail in the United States, with 165 000 incarcerated individuals each year. In 2002, 928 inmates were diagnosed with MRSA wound infections. Sixty-six required hospitalization. At least 10 of them developed invasive disease, including bacteremia, endocarditis or osteomyelitis. 95 Several publicized reports of CA-MRSA have been in college or professional football teams. Eleven cases of CA-MRSA (type USA300) skin and soft tissue infections, boils being the most common, occurred in 2003 in a Los Angeles team of 107 players. Linemen, who have frequent and aggressive close physical contact during play, were identified as a high-risk subgroup. 96 The distinctions between CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA are no longer well-defined, because individuals may be colonized in one setting and develop infection in the other. For example, in one study of over 200 patients discharged home from hospital, 49% of them developed new MRSA infections outside the hospital within 18 months after discharge. 97 Conversely, patients who acquire CA-MRSA in the community may be hospitalized and transmit their strains to other in-patients.",

No invasive neonatal MRSA infection occurred among study infants. Colonization by MSSA and MRSA were significantly more common among women colonized with group B streptococcus (GBS) than among GBS-negative women. 115 CA-MRSA has been reported as the etiologic agent in mastitis in postpartum women. 116 One case report demonstrated passage of MRSA to 2 of 3 pre-term triplets from contaminated breast milk delivered by nasogastric tube.

Nearly 100 cases of iatrogenic CJD have occurred in patients who received cadaveric human growth hormone. 120 Other known prion disease that affect humans are Gerstmamm-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome, kuru, and fatal familial insomnia. These, along with CJD and variant CJD, which will be discussed below, share similar neuropathologic features that include neuronal loss, glial cell proliferation, little or no inflammatory response, accumulation of an abnormal host protein (PrP) and presence of small vacuoles in the neuropil. These vacuoles produce a spongiform appearance, leading to the descriptive name of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a prion disease in cattle.",

The largest known outbreak occurred beginning in 1980 in the United Kingdom, where almost 200 000 cattle were infected and almost 5 million cattle were slaughtered in an attempt to eradicate the disease. An exhaustive epidemiologic investigation concluded that normally herbivorous cattle were being fed infected remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal which had been contaminated with bovine brain and spinal cord. Other contributing theories were that a change in British law allowed lower sterilization temperatures for protein meal and that the use of organic solvents in feed preparation had been abandoned. Cattle farming entails using protein supplements as well as antibiotics and hormones. Soya bean meal is used worldwide as a protein supplement, but because soya beans grow poorly in Europe, cattle farmers turned to less expensive forms of protein.",

These patients were minimally responsive to psychiatric medication. Painful neurologic symptoms such as dysesthesia also occurred early in disease. Onset of hard neurologic signs such as gait disturbance, slurring, and tremor followed several months into the illness. Chorea, dystonia, and myoclonus were seen late in the course.

            "text": "Neuropathologic findings in vCJD differ markedly from those of classic CJD and most resemble the findings in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Post-mortem brain examinations from vCJD patients show multiple microscopic, abnormal aggregates surrounded by holes, resulting in a daisy-like appearance described as 'florid plaques.' Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue shows marked accumulation of protease-resistant prion protein. Lymphoreticular involvement, such as in the tonsils, Peyer patches and appendix, occurs in vCJD (but not CJD). Therefore, a tonsil biopsy showing a characteristic prion protein by Western blot and immunhistochemistry can help establish the diagnosis of vCJD. Tonsil biopsy has shown 100% specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of vCJD. 125 In 2002, a 22-year-old Florida resident developed symptoms consistent with vCJD. Symptoms began with depression and memory loss that interfered with the patient's job. Within a month, the patient developed involuntary muscle movement, gait disturbance and incontinence. The mother of the patient, a UK resident, took the patient to England where the patient continued to deteriorate, developing confusion, hallucinations, speech abnormalities, bradykinesia, and spasticity. He was referred to the National Prion Clinic in the UK. A Western blot analysis of a tonsil biopsy indicated a protease-resistant prion protein (PrP-res) with the characteristic pattern of vCJD, and other analyses were consistent with 105 other vCJD cases in the UK. 126 A total of 208 patients from 11 countries have been diagnosed with vCJD between the first case report in 1996 and June 2008. The majority (167) have been from the UK, but a total of 3 cases occurred in US residents. Two of the US residents were likely exposed while living in the UK, the third was likely exposed while living in Saudi Arabia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that every case of human vCJD had a history of exposure within a country where there were BSE-infected cattle. The majority of persons with vCJD became infected through consumption of cattle products, but three UK cases have been linked to receiving blood from an asymptomatic, infected donor. 127 Strong laboratory and epidemiologic evidence suggest that vCJD and BSE are causally linked. 128 Reports of vCJD in humans in the UK following a large epidemic of BSE in cattle with a lag period consistent with the incubation period of prions strongly suggests that vCJD results from bovine to human transmission of BSE. 129 Most vCJD cases (128 of 138) have occurred in the UK where the highest number of BSE cattle infections have occurred. By 1993, the peak of the BSE epidemic, several hundred thousand BSEinfected cattle might have entered the human food chain. The BSE epidemic in the UK peaked in 1993, and since then the number of BSE cases in cattle has been steadily declining. Fewer cases of cattle BSE may be attributable to bans, beginning in 1988, on use of animal protein in feed.",
