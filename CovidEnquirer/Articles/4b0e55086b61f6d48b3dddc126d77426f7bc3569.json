            "text": "With 10,666 contracted cases and 4806 deaths claimed in Liberia, the country most stricken with Ebola virus disease (EVD), where the epidemic reached a peak in September 2015, was formally declared Ebola-free by the World Health Organization (WHO) on May 9, 2015. 1 The success in promptly reversing the devastating epidemic could be attributed to the joint Training Department efforts from the Liberian authorities and other countries such as the United States, Germany, and China, and organizations including African Union and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res that have established numerous Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in facilitating diagnosis and treatment of involved cases. 2 The China ETC, independently run by the Chinese Government in response to the EVD epidemic crisis, has been formally transferred to local government as scheduled on May 13, 2015, symbolizing its decommissioning after stopping the EVD epidemic. China ETC has admitted 177 suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD cases; among which, 60% of confirmed EVD patients were cured within a 6-month mission. Additionally, the dedicated \"zero infection\" of 444 China ETC healthcare workers (359 Chinese medical staff and 85 local employees) further revealed the success of China in fighting against several deadly contagious diseases such as EVD and malaria. Besides adopting WHO recommended standards for wearing personal protection equipment (PPE), China ETC has provided some unique and invaluable experience in infection control and treatment center operation, which could accelerate the response to newly emerging infectious diseases; particularly in resource-constrained countries where medical supplies are nearly inadequate or exhausted.",

Targeted to provide the most effective healthcare for EVD patients, China ETC is designed to comply with the highest standards available for communicable diseases prevention and control in resourceconstrained areas. Equipped with one observation ward and two treating wards within 18 independent buildings covering an area of 2200 km 2 , China ETC provides better isolation of suspected and confirmed cases. Unlike other ETCs constructed using tents or prefabricated buildings, China ETC used a semi-permanent prefabricated strategy that provided a few distinctive strengths: enhanced robustness of the building; and constant zones corresponding to respective functions and in-depth personal protection, which are also believed to be of benefit to epidemic prevention. 3 Additionally, modernized facilities such as air conditioning and regular medical instruments were also provided so as to enable rapid response when necessary. Compared with tentbased wards that accommodate nearly 10 EVD patients in one tent, China ETC restricted the patient number to two in a single room, with separation of suspected, probable, and confirmed cases, by which potential nosocomial infections could be minimized. Although ventilation becomes less adequate in these semi-permanent buildings, air conditioning can significantly overcome such weakness. Meanwhile, long-distance observation of patients in the wards is difficult, and can be overcome by using an installed video monitoring system so that the status of the inpatients can be directly monitored from outside.",

            "text": "Medical staff are vulnerable to EV infection through their frequent contact with patients because the virus spreads only by direct contact with the blood or body fluids of individuals who have developed symptoms of the disease. Discouraged by the report of 378 Liberian health workers who contracted EVD, a scientifically sound and rational layout and workflow were necessary for effective EVD control in the ETC area. Integrated by the successful experience in fighting against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral respiratory disease caused by the SARS corona virus that led to 8096 cases and 774 deaths worldwide between November 2002 and July 2003, China ETC has conducted strict infection control measures. Considering that previous outbreaks of EVD had a much higher overall fatality rate than SARS (65.4% vs. 11%), 4, 5 various measures have been advocated such as a traffic control building from Taiwanese for infection control. 6 A new three zones and two routes strategy was promoted in China ETC (Figure 1 ): Clean zone (green zone) refers to the area free of any EV contamination, including doctors' offices and nurses' stations; Contaminated zone (red zone) refers to the area with patients with suspected or confirmed EV infection, where PPE must be wore by health workers; Semi-contaminated zone (yellow zone) is an area with a low risk of EV contamination, such as a treatment room and store house. Most of the newly established or provisionally transformed ETCs comprise only a red zone and a green zone to meet the standard recommended by WHO. The exclusively separated yellow zone functions as a buffer zone in minimizing infection risk and improving the tolerance of healthcare workers, as only inner garments are required there. Despite the fact that the yellow zone plays a critical role in infection control, the increased complicity in putting on or taking off PPE may increase the workload of the health workers. To further reduce the risk of hospital infection in our ETC, two divided one-way routes were designed and clearly indicated for carrying clean and contaminated materials through the wards.",

The second-level was daily supervision by the medical personnel on duty through video monitoring. The third-level, namely hospital-level supervision, was undertaken by a 10-member expert team that was responsible for long-term inspection of ECT workers. The supervision team had responsibility for video monitoring and tracing of activities, 24-hour continuous supervision, and problem correction.
