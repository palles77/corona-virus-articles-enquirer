            "text": "Identification of microbial pathogens in clinical specimens is still performed by phenotypic methods that are often slow and cumbersome, despite the availability of more comprehensive genotyping technologies. We present an approach based on whole-genome amplification and resequencing microarrays for unbiased pathogen detection. This 10 h process identifies a broad spectrum of bacterial and viral species and predicts antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity and virulence profiles. We successfully identify a variety of bacteria and viruses, both in isolation and in complex mixtures, and the high specificity of the microarray distinguishes between different pathogens that cause diseases with overlapping symptoms. The resequencing approach also allows identification of organisms whose sequences are not tiled on the array, greatly expanding the repertoire of identifiable organisms and their variants. We identify organisms by hybridization of their DNA in as little as 1-4 h. Using this method, we identified Monkeypox virus and drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in a skin lesion taken from a child suspected of an orthopoxvirus infection, despite poor transport conditions of the sample, and a vast excess of human DNA. Our results suggest this technology could be applied in a clinical setting to test for numerous pathogens in a rapid, sensitive and unbiased manner.",

In contrast, traditional culture-based, phenotypic methods are often limited by lengthy incubation periods, but allow for the identification of multiple pathogens and are currently considered the gold standard in clinical microbiology laboratories.",

            "text": "Recently, DNA microarrays have been used for the simultaneous detection and identification of numerous pathogens using locus-specific amplification methods (Bryant et al., 2004) . Several microarray-based assays have been developed and employed to track or identify multiple pathogenic microorganisms, such as bacteria (Gingeras et al., 1998; Troesch et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 2002; Vora et al., 2004; Davignon et al., 2005) , including potential biowarfare agents such as Bacillus anthracis (Zwick et al., 2005) , respiratory pathogens in clinical samples (Lin et al., 2006) and miscellaneous viruses (Wang et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2004; Palacios et al., 2007) . However, none of these methods provides comprehensive information about the pathogen at the single nucleotide level. Consequently, we devised a diagnostic protocol that employs microarray-based resequencing technology (described in Fodor et al., 1993; 1991; Pease et al., 1994; Chee et al., 1996; Hacia, 1999; Cutler et al., 2001; Warrington et al., 2002) to meet the following requirements: it should be unbiased, requiring no prior information, universal, highly specific and able to discriminate between pathogens that impart similar or overlapping symptoms. In addition, the approach should be comprehensive, sensitive, not influenced by human DNA, and in this case detecting agents on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Category A, B and C Priority pathogen list. Rapid turnaround is also important and ideally results should be generated the same day.",

Analysing the intensity from these multiple features permits detection of the reference sequence as well as characterization of relative Single-nuclectidepolymorphisms (SNPs).

All three mixtures contained a background of human DNA to mimic a clinical specimen: DNA prepared from nasal washes for the respiratory mixture, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the meningitis-encephalitis mixture or a human cell line (HeLa) for the septicaemia mixture. Each mixture was tested on the array and the resulting sequences were analysed. The three experiments detect and sequence 48, 11 and 25 genetic fragments respectively ( Table 1 ). The sequence for each conserved element underwent BLAST analysis in which the highest scoring matches determine the identity. The antibiotic resistance (ABR) elements predict likely resistance to their associated antibiotics. Finally, the pathogenicity genes represent the various toxins and virulence factors that the pathogen can generate. Results shown in Table 1 indicate that despite the presence of background nucleic acids of human origin, all expected organisms were detected. We also tested DNA extracted from normal nasal wash, CSF and sputum samples to determine the hybridization pattern of background organisms. We detected Neisseria 16S, Pseudomonas 16S and human 18S and mitochondrial DNA in the nasal wash. No specific organisms were found in the CSF sample.

The nondetection of resistance phenotypes was due either to the absence of the gene sequence tiled on the array (such as the non-detection of rifampicin resistance for the S. haemolyticus strain), or to resistance mechanisms likely caused by overexpression of an efflux pump.

The test may not be designed to detect -and distinguisha closely related organism. The resequencing-based approach of the pathogen array tiles probes with all four nucleotides at each position, making it possible to detect point mutations in the sample relative to the reference sequence. This feature greatly expands the repertoire of identifiable organisms far beyond those that are actually included on the array. For example, the Smallpox virus is a member of the Poxviridae family, which comprises, among others, the closely related Monkeypox, Camelpox and Vaccinia viruses. Smallpox, a once devastating disease, shares several key symptoms with Monkeypox, e.g. the formation of skin pustules. While Smallpox has been declared eradicated by the World Health Organization, the Smallpox virus could be used in a bioterrorism threat. In this case, it would be important to rapidly distinguish this organism from its close relative, Monkeypox virus, which causes a far less serious disease. To test the ability of the array to distinguish closely related pathogens in a clinical sample, we selected material from an African child suffering from a pustular infection of unknown aetiology, but where Monkeypox virus was suspected (Damon et al., 2006) . DNA was extracted from a skin sample and amplified using WGA with generic random hexamers. The resulting target was then hybridized to the multi-pathogen microarray and nucleotide sequences were determined from the signals as described (Cutler et al., 2001) , and compared with sequences in GenBank. The results from a portion of the RNA polymerase gene are shown in Fig. 2 . Sequence analysis of the clinical sample and comparison with GenBank sequences of various orthopoxviruses revealed several SNPs which clearly distinguish the agent detected in the clinical sample from the Smallpox virus and confirm its identity as Monkeypox virus (Fig. 2) .",

The multi-pathogen microarray contains sequences representing 962 genes, including conserved genes, pathogenicity and virulence genes and antibiotic resistance genes. Furthermore, the ability to determine the nucleotide sequence at single-base-pair resolution allows the potential identification of pathogens with similar, but not identical, sequences to those represented on the microarray. For example, although the pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis is not represented on the array, we identified it from a sample by resequencing a portion of the 16S rRNA gene for S. aureus (data not shown). As further exemplified by results from the scab samples, identification of the Monkeypox virus, which was not included on the array, was possible through SNP detection from the Smallpox virus, which was present. In addition to its potential use in identifying known pathogens in a clinical setting, the multi-pathogen array could theoretically be used to discover new organisms and their variants. Thus, a single application of sample to the multipathogen microarray potentially replaces thousands of individual PCR reactions. Similarly, the highly multiplexed microarray-based assay can replace hundreds of culturebased tests.",

Our results demonstrate the ability to detect a large number of genetic elements, even within a complex mixture, and in the presence of large amounts of human DNA. At present, the pathogen identification method described here is limited by sequences deposited in the NCBI non-redundant sequence database. With the increasing availability of sequence data for new organisms, these databases will improve and identification of more organisms in clinical samples will be facilitated.",

However, an important feature of unbiased pathogen detection in a clinical setting is the ability to identify organisms in mixtures. We created mixtures of pathogens and show that the multi-pathogen array is capable of deconvoluting and correctly identifying these organisms. In addition to the mock clinical specimens, the scab sample illustrates the ability to detect bacteria, associated ABR genes and viral DNA, all in the same test. Their detection was not influenced by an excess of human DNA in the sample, demonstrating the discriminatory power of the tool and the strength of pathogen detection in a complex environment. Testing samples from different mock syndromes demonstrated the ability of this new diagnostic tool to distinguish between two viruses and three bacteria even when these organisms were phylogenetically close. Moreover, the ability to perform BLAST analysis with each sequence obtained allowed us to identify pathogens with confidence, to eliminate all risk of cross-hybridization and to detect pathogens that could not be detected by classical methods.",

It is therefore possible to carry out pathogen identification using this technique in the course of a single day or less. Because the microarray potentially replaces thousands of individual PCR reactions, this translates to a major reduction in cumulative assay time.

We envision that future arrays will contain a smaller subset of probes and will therefore be smaller in size and consequently more economical. An additional requirement for clinical utility is that the protocols we describe become streamlined, standardized and automated to provide time to result within a few hours in a routine setting.
