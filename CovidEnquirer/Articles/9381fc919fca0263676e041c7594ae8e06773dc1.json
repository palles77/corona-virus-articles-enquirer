Biochemical analysis of the TRTV-induced proteins Ling and Pringle, 1988; Cavanagh and Barrett, 1988) and RNAs (Cavanagh and Barrett, 1988) suggested that this virus was a member of the Paramyxoviridae family and more closely related to the genus Pneumovirus (subfamily Pneumovirinae; Pringle, 1991) than to the other two genera in this family, Morbilhkus and f'aramyxovirus (subfamily Paramyxovirinae). Our recent cloning and sequencing of the TRTV fusion (F) protein gene has ' To whom reprints requests should be addressed. supported this view. Thus the TRTV F protein had 39% amino acid identity with that of human respiratory syncytial (RS)virus, a pneumovirus, but only about half that with members of the other two genera (Vu eta/., 1991) . In order to identify the gene upstream (3'proximal) from the F gene, we have used an oligonucleotide, based on the F gene sequence, to prime cDNA synthesis in the hope that some clones would be generated from polycistronic mRNA which comprised F and the 3'proximal gene. This was indeed the case, although the gene adjacent to the 3' terminus of the F gene was not that which had been expected from knowledge of the gene order of RS virus and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) (Collins et a/., 1984; Chambers et al., 1990) .",

Briefly, the recombinant phagemid was digested within the polylinker either with BstXl and Xbal or with Apal and HindIll (Boehringer-Mannheim) to generate deletions from opposite ends and deletions generated with exonuclease III (Northumbria Biologicals).

This strategy was based on the knowledge, gained from probing Northern blots of infected cell RNA with F gene-specific probes, that polycistronic mRNAs were generated during transcription ( Fig. 1 , lanes 3 and 5) and the hope that some of these mRNAs contained F and the upstream gene. Six clones were obtained, two of which did not extend beyond the 5' terminus of the F mRNA. The remaining four clones did extend into the 3' proximal gene; indeed two of them continued into a furthergene (Fig. 2) . Unexpectedly one clone (MF35) extended 622 nucleotides FIG. 1.

            "text": "The M gene is adjacent to the 3' end of the F gene of TRTV As described above the identity of the gene sequences contained within each clone was ascertained by sequencing. Clones MF35 and 36 encoded a large ORF of 254 amino acids. The next longest ORF would encode an ORF of only 51 residues, other ORFs being less than half that size. Comparison of the sequence of the longest ORF with a databank of Paramyxoviridae sequences revealed that it had 37% amino acid identity with the M protein of RS virus which comprises 256 residues (Fig. 3) . The calculated molecular weights of the M protein for TRTV and RS virus were 27,595 and 28,7 14, respectively. Almost immediately upstream from the beginning of the ORF was the sequence GGGACAAGU (nucleotides l-9, doubly underlined in Fig. 3 ) which was identical to the sequence just upstream from the F ORF (nucleotides 827-835, doubly underlined in Fig. 3 ) which we have suggested is the start sequence for the F mRNA (Vu et al., 1991) . Confirmation that these sequences did mark the beginnings of the M and F mRNAs was obtained by mapping the 5' end of the respective mRNAs. Gene-specific oligonucleotides were 5' endlabeled and then used for primer extension. Both the M and the F primer-extended products terminated to yield a double band, consistent with the ends of the respective mRNAs having been reached (Fig. 4) . The same end-labeled oligonucleotides were used in sequencing reactions, with [35S]ATP present, with pBluescript containing either the M or the F cDNA inserts. Electrophoresis of the reaction products in the same gels as those used for analysis of the cDNA generated by primer extension showed that the lower band of the doublet comigrated with a G residue which was the beginning of the sequence GGGACAAGU. This was direct evidence that nucleotides l-9 and 827-835 (Fig. 3) marked the beginning of the M and F mRNAs, respectively. The upper band of the doublet, which was sometimes of lower intensity, was considered most likely to be an artifact, as proposed previously (Jorgensen et al., 1987) . The presence of partial cross-banding in the pBluescript-generated sequence was a consequence of the presence of some n -1 oligonucleotide in the primer preparations.",

However, it was possible that in the TRTV genome there were one or more genes between M and F and that during the synthesis of our cDNA clones there might have been a fault leading to the deletion of intervening genes. Alternatively the virus RNA preparation may have contained deletion genomes which produced defective RNAfrom which the cDNAs were generated, although we have no evidence for the existence of such RNA. To investigate these possibilities we have used the PCR to generate cDNA, using UK/ 3BV/85 virion RNA as template, covering the proposed M-F junction. First oligonucleotides A and B (Fig. 2 (6) F mRNA by primer extension. (A) An end-labeled 25-mer oligonucleotide whose 5' end corresponded to nucleotide position 79 in Fig. 3 was used to prime extension on M mRNA present in poly(A)+-selected TRTVinfected Vero cell RNA. The same end-labeled oligonucleotide was used to prime a sequencing reaction using pBluescript containing insert MF36 as substrate. All reactions were analyzed in a 6% acrylamide sequencing gel. Primer extension of the M mRNA produced a product which migrated as a double band (right hand side four lanes), the lower of which comigrated with the first nucleotide G in the sequence GGGACAAGU derived from pBluescript containing clone MF36. (B) A 25-mer, end-labeled oligonucleotide whose 5'end was located 78 nucleotides from the presumed start of the F mRNA was used to prime extension on F mRNA present in poly(A)+-selected RNA. The oligonucleotide was also used to prime a sequencing reaction using pBluescript containing insert MF37 as substrate. Primer extension of the F mRNA produced a product which migrated as a double band (right hand side four lanes), the lower of which comigrated with the first base of the sequence GGGACAAGU.

Each point on the profile represents the average hydropathy of a span of five residues. face of the plasma membrane at areas associated with the viral glycoproteins (Caldwell and Lyles, 1986; Peeples and Bratt, 1984; Faaberg and Peeples, 1988) and actin (Giuffre eta/., 1982; Bohn eta/., 1986) . In addition M has a role in regulating viral transcription (Marx eta/., 1974) . The many interactions of M are believed to involve complex interactions of both hydrophobic and ionic natures (Caldwell and Lyles, 1986; Faaberg and Peeples, 1988) . As for morbilliviruses and paramyxoviruses (Chambers et a/., 1986; Galinski et al., 1987; Limo and Yilma, 1990 ) the hydropathy plots for TRTV and RS virus indicate that the M protein is moderately hydrophobic. While none of the sequences are obvious candidates for membrane-spanning structures, both TRTV and RS virus have a highly hydrophobic sequence of 14 residues centering around amino acid 200 (Figs. 3 and 6 ). This stretch in particular might be membrane associated. Bellini et a/. (1986) have drawn attention to a sequence of 13 to 14 largely nonpolar residues situated about 90 residues from the carboxy terminus of the M protein of the morbilliviruses which might interact with the lipid environment of the virus envelope. With respect to ionic interactions the M proteins of paramyxoviruses and morbilliviruses are basic in nature, basic and acidic residues accounting for 12-14 and 896, respectively, of M residues. Many (12-l 6) of the basic residues occur in pairs. In contrast, TRlV and RS virus M proteins have only a small preponderance of basic over acidic residues, these residues accounting for 9-l 1 and 8-9%, respectively, of total residues. TRTV and RS virus have only 6 and 2 basic resi-dues, respectively, in pairs (Satake and Venkatesan, 1984) . TRTV M protein does resemble that of the other two genera in that the amino terminal one-third of M has an acidic character, TRTV M having 7 and 2 acidic and basic residues, respectively, in this region. However, this is not a general observation for pneumoviruses as RS virus has almost equal numbers of acid and basic residues (8 and 7, respectively) in the first third of the molecule (Satake and Venkatesan, 1984) .",

In contrast two pneumoviruses, human RS virus and PVM, have the equivalent genes in the order 3'-M-SH-G-F-5'; i.e., they have, unlike the other two genera, the SH and cell attachment protein gene(G) on the 3'side of the F gene (Collins et a/., 1984; Chambers et a/., 1990) . It was a surprise, therefore, when we found that TRTV had the M gene immediately adjacent to the 3' side of the F gene. There was no evidence from probing Northern blots that TRTV UK/3BV/85 had generated defective RNA which might have had genes deleted between M and F. Even if such defective RNA had been present, then in order to generate clones MF34-37 the deletion event would have had to be such as to delete genes in their entirety while at the same time preserving completely intact the M gene and the beginning of F. We have confirmed the beginning of both the M and the F mRNAs by 5' mapping and have shown that M has mRNA start and end sequences very similar to those of F. The PCR data supported the gene order deduced from clones MF34-37. Although the PCR would tend to favor the amplification of small products, e.g., the 300-nucleotide product obtained using oligonucleotide pairs A/B, over larger ones, e.g., the product which would have been obtained if there had been a gene between M and F, there was no sign at all of larger PCR products to substantiate the view that there was a gene between M and F. Moreover, the gene order M-F was further supported by the PCR data obtained with three other TRlV strains, representing isolates from two continents, isolated over a 1 O-year period, which had different passage histories, and which had been propagated in chicken tracheal organ cultures.",

Given that TRTV has some pneumovirus characteristics but appears to have diverged a considerable time ago from the other known members of this genus, further analysis of the number, nature, and order of TRTV genes will be instructive with regard to whether those genes currently known to be unique to the pneumovirus genus are essential for replication. In addition, study of TRTV may help to clarify the evolutionary relationships between the genera of the Paramyxoviridae family.",
