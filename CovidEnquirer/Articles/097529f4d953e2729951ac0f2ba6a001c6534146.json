            "text": "Cordyceps sinensis, one of the best known traditional Chinese medicines and health foods, has been highly valued for the treatment of a wide range of diseases and reported to have antioxidant properties. In the present study, the antioxidant activities of hot-water extracts from natural and cultured mycelia of C. sinensis were investigated and evaluated using six in vitro assays, including inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation; scavenging abilities on DPPHd, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals; the reducing power and the chelating ability on ferrous ions. Among these assays, the extracts showed the best effect on the inhibition of linoleic peroxidation with the lowest IC50 values and with an inhibition rate over 90% at concentration of 0.8-1.6 mg/ml, more stable than that of a-tocopherol, a recognised natural antioxidant. The scavenging activities on superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals of the two extracts were slightly lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene. DPPHd scavenging activities of both extracts reached over 80% inhibition at 4-8 mg/ml. Both extracts showed moderate reducing power and ferrous ion chelating activity. The IC50 value of the extract from cultured mycelia in all the tests, except for linoleic acid peroxidation, was significantly lower than that of natural mycelia. There was no evident correlation between the antioxidant activity and the content of protein, polysaccharides and mannitol of extracts from C. sinensis; the antioxidant activity may be due to a combined effect of these or some other compounds. These results suggested that both the extracts from cultured and natural mycelia have direct and potent antioxidant activities and that the cultured mycelia of the fungus could be used for the antioxidant activity to reduce the human demands on the natural resources of the fungus, an endangered species.",

The complex including the fungal stroma and the sclerotium, which appears as larva body owing to the intact exoskeleton of the insect, has been used as a health food and traditional medicine to invigorate the lung and nourish the kidney in China for hundreds of years, at least from the 17th century (Wang, 1694; Zhao, 1765) .",

However, recent studies have demonstrated that C. sinensis can be used to treat a wide range of conditions, including respiratory, renal, liver, nervous system and cardiovascular diseases; tumour; aging; and also hyposexuality and hyperlipidemia (reviewed in Zhu, Halpern, & Jones, 1998) . It has been officially classified as a drug in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1964 (Committee of Pharmacopoeia, Chinese Ministry of Health, 1964 Health, , 2005 . The use of the fungal products in medicinal treatment and in health foods has become very popular since 1990s and more so since the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. The market demand for C. sinensis is growing sharply in many countries, especially in Asia, in recent years (Sharma, 2004; Vinning & Tobgay, 2004) .",

The price of natural products of C. sinensis is now over US$12,000/kg (for average quality in 2006) in the market and is still increasing. As substitution to the natural products, living strains have been isolated from natural C. sinensis and cultivated in large quantity by fermentation technology (Wang, 1995; Zhu et al., 1998) . The fermentation of mycelia has been proved as a promising method to meet the needs of human consumption and to reduce the pressure on natural resources of the species which is in danger (It has been officially classified as an endanger species by CITES Management Authority of China and China Customers, 2000) .",

A polysaccharide which can protect PC12 cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced neuronal cell toxicity was isolated by Li et al. (2003) , but the Cordyceps mycelia used from Wan Fong Pharmaceutical Factory (Zhejiang, China) were derived from a fungal strain named Cephalosporium sinensis Chen sp. nov. [sic! A nomenclaturally illegitimate fungal name], which raised doubts whether it is truly a strain of C. sinensis (Jiang & Yao, 2003) and, indeed, was later proved to be a different species (Ke, 2005) . Kunitomo (2000a, 2000b) reported that both water and ethanol extracts from artificial cultivated fruit-bodies of C. sinensis from the Xinhui Xinhan Artificial Cordyceps Factory (Guangdong, China) could scavenge ROS by inhibiting malondialdehyde formation by the peroxynitrite generator SIN-1. Although the results have been referred to in many subsequent investigations (e.g. Buenz, Bauer, Osmundson, & Motley, 2004 Li et al., 2003) , there is, however, a doubt that the fungal material used was authentic C. sinensis, due to the fact that reports exist of cultivation of fruit-bodies of this fungus not being repeatable and that the manufacturer is, in fact, selling products of C. militaris. Li, Li, Dong, and Tsim (2001) compared the antioxidant activities of natural C. sinensis and cultured Cordyceps mycelia from different sources by three tests (xanthine oxidase, induction of hemolysis and lipid peroxidation assays) using PBS at 37 1C for 12 h to extract the compounds from samples, and were able to show the similar effects of the cultured mycelia to the natural products. However, the cultured material used by Li et al. (2001) was derived from a wide range of strains, of which some are apparently not from a true C. sinensis, e.g. products from Chinese Medicine Factory of Jiangxi and from Hebei Boding Pharmaceutical Factory (see Jiang & Yao, 2003) . Further, the traditional Chinese medicines are boiled in water for medications or as health foods and soaked in alcohol as drink. The extraction using different solvents and temperatures may have resulted in different compounds.",

Due to the complexity of the oxidation-antioxidation processes, it is obvious that no single method is capable of providing a comprehensive picture of the antioxidant profile of a studied sample.

Their IC50 values were also the lowest among all the assays performed (Table 3) . These results showed that the extracts from C. sinensis have great potential in inhibition of the linoleic peroxidation. Superoxide anion radicals are known to be very harmful to cellular components as a precursor of more ROS. Although the scavenging activities of the hot water extracts from both natural and cultured mycelia of C. sinensis were just a little lower than that of BHT, but they were much higher than that of methanol extracts reported by Zhang et al. (2003) , IC50 of 8.60-12.4 mg/ml compared with 1.0070.08 and 1.2470.05 of this study (Table 3) . Further, the IC50 values of hydroxyl radical scavenging of the hot water extracts from C. sinensis (Table 3 , as 0.9670.06 and 1.0370.03 mg/ml, respectively) were also much lower than that of methanol extract reported by Zhang et al.

            "text": "Some of the compounds in the natural and cultured mycelia of C. sinensis were reported to be the effective components of scavenging free radicals, e.g. polysaccharides (Li et al., 2002 (Li et al., , 2003 and mannitol and cordycepin (Zhang et al., 2003) . However, the contents of polysaccharides, mannitol and protein were determined in this study (Table 1) and there was no evident correlation between the contents of any compounds and the antioxidant activity. Mannitol, a polyol, is believed to be able to scavenge ROS (Jennings, Ehrenshaft, Pharr, & Williamson, 1998) , whilst mannitol solution showed scavenging activity on hydroxyl radical only but not on superoxide radical in the present study (Fig. 1) . Further, the fact that the scavenging rate of hydroxyl radical by mannitol solution was significantly lower than that by the extracts from C. sinensis (po0.05) at the same concentration (Fig. 1) suggested that mannitol was only partially in charge of the scavenging activity of extracts from C. sinensis on hydroxyl radical. The cordycepin in the natural and cultured mycelia of C. sinensis has been reported as often too low to be detectable by HPLC (Guo, Zhu, Zhang, & Zhang, 1998; Li et al., 2004) . Therefore, it cannot be concluded here that any certain compound has a main effect on the antioxidant activity of C. sinensis. It may be possible that the antioxidant activity is determined by a combination of effects of some of the compounds.",

These results suggest that pharmacological functions of C. sinensis are due to, at least partially, their protective effects against oxidation and that it is a promising way to use the cultured mycelia of the fungus for the antioxidant activity to reduce the human demands on the natural resources of C. sinensis, an endangered species.",
