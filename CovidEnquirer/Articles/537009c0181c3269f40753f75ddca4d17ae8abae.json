We further analyzed the data and found that the number of discharges from Tongji Hospital accounted for 68 % of the study cases, compared with 34.1 %. However, a large number of undischarged cases remain uncertain. Therefore, the statistics of CFR in the Central South Hospital have a marked deviation compared with that in the Jin Yin-tan hospital. The rapid increase in the number of patients, inadequate treatment conditions, delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment, and inadequate knowledge of the virus in the early days in Wuhan affected the treatment effect. If it is predicted according to the estimated national CFR, under the current medical conditions, the number of national deaths caused by COVID-19 is approximately 4,938 (= 70,548 \u00d7 7%), wherein most of them are in Wuhan. In essence, this approach is using the estimated CFR of the first 9 days (February 7) to predict the possible deaths of currently diagnosed patients. The epidemic is continuing, and the number of confirmed patients is stillincreasing. If no major medical change transpires, the predicted value of future deaths will be extremely large. If the prediction is based on the estimated CFR in Wuhan, the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 is even more alarming. Moreover, all undiagnosed deaths caused by COVID-19 are not included.",
