Clinical symptoms and demographic data were also recorded. A total of 102 (72%) were outpatients and 39 (28%) were hospitalized patients. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) genotypes were determined using Real-Time Multiplex PCR. DNA extracts of positive samples were confirmed by conventional PCR targeting the NS1 gene. Co-infection with other enteric viruses were determined in HBoV positive samples using Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: HBoV was detected in 8 (5.7%) children with AGE. Children were in the age group between 1-24 months. HBoV1 and HBoV3 genotypes were each detected in 3 (37.5%) stool samples and HBoV2 in 2 (25%) stool samples. Co-infection with other enteric viruses included Rotavirus (37.5%); Adenovirus (37.5%); Norovirus (25%) and Astrovirus (12.5%). CONCLUSION: HBoV infections could be seen as a potential emerging diarrheal pathogen in South Africa. Further studies are required to understand the role of HBoV infections in children and adults with acute gastroenteritis.",

The presence of HBoV in asymptomatic individuals raises questions regarding the role of the virus in gastrointestinal infections as a pathogen or just a bystander (16) . This is due to limited available studies investigating the pathogenesis of HBoV due to the lack of cell culture system or animal model (17) (18) (19) .",

In this study HBoV was detected in children between 1-24 months of age (\u226424 months) ( (15) have reported that the transmission of HBoV was through ingestion of contaminated food/water (e.g. via flies, inadequate sanitation facilities, inadequate sewage and water treatment systems, and the cleaning food with contaminated water), direct contact with infected faces (faecaloral-route), person-to-person contact and poor personal hygiene. In this study, the patients came from rural communities with no or inadequate water and sanitation infrastructure and poor hygiene practices (21) . From the 8 positive cases of HBoV in this study, 7 (87%) used tap water as a source of water and only 1 (12%) used spring water as a source of water at home. Rural communities in South Africa usually collect water in storage tanks for both domestic and sanitation use due to scarcity of water in rural areas, this results in the contamination of water through faecal-oral-route transmission (21) . Waterborne viruses represent a major health risk to population worldwide (22) . There is currently limited data worldwide exploring the circulation of HBoV from environmental samples.

The widespread distribution of HBoV1 and HBoV3 in comparison to HBoV2 could presumably be due to differences in pathogenesis that may influence their transmission route and ability to establish persistence (29) .

Amplification condition for HBoV1 were initial denaturation for 10 min at 94\u00b0C, 35 cycles of amplification (94\u00b0C for 1 min, 54\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min) and the expected product size was 354 bp. HBoV2/4 amplification was initiated with a denaturation step of 15 min at 95\u00baC followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00baC for 15 sec, 53\u00baC for 30 sec, and 72\u00baC for 1 min, the expected product size was 454 bp for HBoV2/4. Human Bocavirus 2 and 4 used the same antisense primers devised by Kapoor et al. (18) , which was unable to differentiate between HBoV2 and 4 genotypes. Therefore, genotypes were further confirmed through sequencing. The amplification of HBoV3 consisted of 1 step of 95\u00baC for 15 min followed by 45 cycles of 94\u00baC for 20 sec, 52\u00baC for 20 sec, and 72\u00baC for 40 sec, followed by an extension step at 72\u00baC for 10 min, the expected product size for HBoV3 was 440 bp (41) .",

Another limitation was the small number of stool samples collected. Human Bocavirus infections are increasingly being recognized globally as a new emerging virus associated with diarrhea. Therefore, surveillance of the virus is crucial to monitor the prevalence and to help understand the role of this virus in individuals with AGE. The involvement of HBoV in children with AGE from rural communities in South Africa are most likely to be under investigated and underreported. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to report on the prevalence and genetic diversity of human Bocavirus in children with AGE from rural communities in Limpopo, South Africa.4. Materials and methods4.1 Study design:The study was a cross-sectional study and investigations werecarried out between June 2017 and July 2018. Stool samples were randomly collected from patients at different Clinics (outpatients) and Hospitals (inpatients) from rural communities in the Vhembe region, Limpopo Province of South Africa. Clinics and Hospitals were both chosen because most cases of AGE in South Africa are seen by primary health care centres (Clinics) situated in the rural communities where only severe cases of AGE (with dehydration) are referred by the Clinic to the Hospital where they take over the treatment plan. In total 14 Clinics and 3 district hospitals were visited during the study period.",

Only children who fitted the criteria for acute gastroenteritis (diarrhea/vomiting/fever/cramping/dehydration) were recruited. Samples were transported to the University of Venda after collection at 4 o C and stored at -20 o C until further analysis.4.4 Data collection:Personal information such as age and sex was collected from patients including consultation details, parental status, family living conditions, water source, and type of latrine facility used at home. Clinical symptoms, including symptoms of fever, vomiting, cough, diarrhea and dehydration were recorded.4.5 DNA extraction and amplification: The Boom method was used for DNA extraction as previously described (40). The method is based on the lysing and nuclease inactivating properties of the chaotropic agent guanidinium thiocyanate, together with the nucleic acid-binding proprieties of silica particles. The extracted DNA was stored at -20\u00baC until further analysis. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) Real Time PCR commercial Kit was used to detect HBoV1-4 genotypes following the manufacturer's instructions (Liferiver TM , Shanghai, China). Amplification reactions were performed in a volume of 40\u00b5l containing 35\u00b5l reaction mix, 0.4\u00b5l Enzyme Mix, 1\u00b5l Internal Control and 4\u00b5l extracted DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions.The Real-Time m-PCR was performed using a Corbett Research Rotor Gene 6000 with the following conditions: 2 min at 37\u00b0C, 2 min at 94\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 15 sec at 93\u00b0C and 1 min 60\u00b0C.
