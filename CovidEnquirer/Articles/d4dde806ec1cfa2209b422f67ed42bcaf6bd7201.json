In 2016, an automated bioinformatics pipeline 74 VirusDetect has been reported to facilitate the large-scale virus detection using sRNA-seq [6]. This study 75 aimed to detect viruses in D. nuttalli, D. silvarum and A. testudinarium using the sRNA-seq based method. 76 As a unexpectedly result, VirusDetect reported the existence of ASFV in D. nuttalli from sheep and bovine. 77 To confirm this result, a 235-bp DNA segment of ASFV was detected in D. nuttalli, D. silvarum and sheep, 78 but not in A. testudinarium and bovine.

This disease results in high mortality, approaching 100%[1]. ASF first broke out inKenya  54   in 1921 [2]  and remained restricted to Africa until 1957, when it was reported in Portugal. In the following 55 years, ASF spread further geographically and caused economic losses on the swine industry. In 2018, ASF 56 was reported in Liaoning province of China and then spread to more than 20 provinces. Although ASFV can 57 be fast detected using PCR with specific primers [3], the understanding of ASFV vectors are still incomplete 58 ASFV infects only members of the Suidae family including domestic pigs, warthogs and bushpigs[5]. 60It is well accepted that only soft ticks belonging to the genus Ornithodoros are potential biological vectors 61 of ASFV. To the best of our knowledge, ASFV has not been reported to be detected in Dermacentor nuttalli, 62 D. silvarum and Amblyomma testudinarium, which are three species belonging to Ixodidae (hard ticks). 63Dermacentor ticks share similarities in the range of hosts as Ornithodoros ticks, but Dermacentor ticks have 64 higher mobility and a wider range of geographic distribution. Compared to Ornithodoros and other Ixodidae 65 ticks, A. testudinarium ticks have a wider range of geographic distribution in south of China, where ASF has 66 been reported in 2018 but Ornithodoros occurrences have not been documented.
