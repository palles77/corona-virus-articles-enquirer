At the current time, complete genomic sequences exist for at least one representative of almost all the known RNA virus groups; this information has led to the elucidation of evolutionary relationships between many superficially diverse groups. It has often been found that overall strategies of replication, such as the relative location within a genome of genes of similar function, the presence or lack of subgenomic mRNAs, readthrough of termination codons for downstream products, or use of an 'ambisense' transcription strategy, show that certain viruses are distantly related, even when no sequence homology remains [1] . In addition, a number of short amino-acid-sequence elements have been recognized as indicators of the function of particular proteins and it has been suggested that proteins sharing such motifs are also related by descent from common ancestors. These indicators include the 'GDD motif, which is characteristic of RNA polymerases [2,3,4-], the 'DEAD motif [5] and the 'G-x-x-GKS/T motif, which are characteristic of RNA helicases [5] [6] [7] , and the sequence elements surrounding the amino acids in the active sites of viral-encoded proteases [8] .",

In the case of the bunyaviruses, the plant and animal representatives are so closely related as to be placed within the same family, and an argument could be made that the plant tenuiviruses should be considered as belonging to the same genus as the animal uukuviruses and phleboviruses. In other cases, the plant and animal viruses are counterparts in the sense that they share genome organization and transcription strategies, and may share sequence homology in a number of proteins (even though each may possess unique genes required for replication in their respective hosts), but the plant and animal virions may be quite different in morphology. The existence of such viruses indicates that plant and animal viruses have radiated from a small number of ancestral prototypic viruses, and that the repertoire of successful replication modes may be limited. These studies have also made it clear that recombination has played an important role in the evolution of RNA viruses, and that viruses can acquire the ability to jump across wide phylogenetic barriers, whether by recombination or adaptation, rather more easily than would have been suspected a decade ago.",

Differential splicing (for viruses that replicate in the nucleus), translation initiation at more than one start codon, and ribosomal frame shifting have been described. In the V/P gene of the paramyxovirus simian virus 5 (SV5), two non-templated nucleotides are added during transcription of mRNAs to shift the reading frame in some, but not all, transcripts [14] . Within the past year, reports of similar mechanisms used by several other members of the paramyxovirus family have been described. Not only is the addition of non-templated G residues to shift the reading frame found in many, but not all, of these viruses, but the details differ among the different viruses and appear to be useful in the classification of the members of this family.",

The genus paramyxovirus includes Newcastle disease virus (NDV), the type virus, Sendai virus, human parainfluenza virus (PIV)-I, PIV-2, PIV-3, and PIV-4, mumps virus, and SV5, all of which contain a neuraminidase activity. The morbillivirus genus encompasses measles virus, rinderpest virus, and canine distemper virus, all of which are quite similar to paramyxoviruses but lack the neuraminidase activity. Pneumoviruses (respiratory syncytial virus and pneumonia virus of mice) are distinct, and contain a number of extra genes in addition to the nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), membrane protein (M), glycoprotein (G), fusion protein (F), and large polymerase protein (L) genes common to all members of the family.

The details of the V/P gene strategy are illustrated in figure 1. Two mechanisms are used: initiation of translation at two different AUGs, and the ad dition of non-templated G residues to shift the reading frame. In some cases all three reading frames are utilized and up to four protein products are produced from the V/P gene. In measles [15] , PIV-1 [16. ], PW-3 [17..] , and Sendai viruses [18], a P protein of approximately 600 amino acids is translated from an mRNA that is a faithful complement of the genome. In addition, a smaller protein (C) of about 200 amino acids is translated from the same mRNA by internal initiation at a methionine in a second reading frame. The V protein, which is amino-coterminal with P but contains a carboxyterminal domain that is highly conserved and rich in cysteine residues, is encoded by an mRNA that is formed when a single non-templated G residue is inserted into the mRNA during transcription. This shifts the frame to the third possible frame, resulting in a V protein of about 400 amino acids. Note that for PIV-3, an mRNA containing two non-templated G residues is also produced and is translated into a fourth protein, the D protein.",

The plus-stranded togaviruses as well as a number of plus-stranded plant viruses transcribe a subgenornic mRNA for the structural protein(s), and all of the minus-stranded viruses produce mRNAs that are less than genome length. These mRNAs lack a cL~-acting terminal element (either a sequence or a structure) essential for initiation of replication by the viral replicase, and thus cannot replicate in infected cells. The coronaviruses also produce up to seven different subgenomic mRNAs of genomic polarity. Sethna et al. [23] reported the presence of minus-strand copies of these mRNAs in coronavirus-infected cells and suggested that the subgenomic RNAs could replicate. As discussed below, during the past year a number of groups have reported that coronavirus mRNAs are indeed actively replicated in infected cells. The Coronaviridae are plus-stranded RNA viruses with the largest known RNA genomes, more than 27 kb. The genome organization of a typical coronavirus is illustrated in figure 2a (reviewed in [24] ). Almost 20 kb at the 5' end is devoted to two long ORFs encoding the RNA replicase. The replicase is translated from the genomic RNA as two large potyproteins, with the larger, presumably produced by ribosomal frame-shifting, cormsponding to the entire 20 kb region. These polyproteins are believed to be posttranslationally cleaved by two cysteine proteases, which are encoded within them, into an unknown number of final products [25, 26] . -/q'a atreaqtuatu papoaua-gru> o~ ptr\u00a2 'p!sdeaoapnu i-ca uoBnlo^a pue uo!lez!ue~o ~u~D lost from some coronavirus-like viruses but not from others.

            "text": "The genomes of Sindbis virus, the type alphavirus, family Togaviridae, and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), are compared in figure 3 . The relationship between Sindbis virus and TMV is straightforward. In each case the replicase genes are translated from the genomic RNA, readthrough of a termination codon is required to translate the RNA polymerase, and there are long stretches of clear amino acid sequence homology in three genes. The structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic mRNA and appear to be unrelated to one another. TMV is a rodshaped virus, and Sindbis virus is enveloped. The recent demonstration that the nucleocapsid protein of Sindbis virus is structurally related to chymotrypsin is an exciting development and suggests that this capsid may have been obtained by recombination from a cellular protease (Rossman, personal communication). The RNA replication signals in the 3' non-translated region (NTR) are also different in the two viruses. The Sindbis virus 3' NTR contains a number of sequence elements, including repeated sequences and a 19 nucleotide conserved element, that are believed to function as linear elements, and which terminate in a poly(A) tract. TMV contains a 3'terminal nucleotide sequence capable of forming a tertiary structure similar to that of tRNA that is recognized by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. These tRNA-like sequences in TMV and a number of other plant virus RNAs are thought to be important for RNA replication and are known to be essential for infectivity, because certain point mutations within the sequence are lethal [38] . Upstream of this structure are a number of stem and loop elements in which certain bases in the loops can hydrogen bond with sequences adjacent to the stems, forming 'pseudo- knots' [39] . Recently, it has been shown that the 3' NTR of TMV (containing both the tRNA and pseudoknot domains) can substitute functionally for a poly(A) tail in the expression of heterologous mRNAs in both plant and animal cells [40.\u00b0] . Some synergistic interaction with other viral elements is suggested by the fact that maximal expression occurs in certain constructs in which the 5' NTR and 3' NTR of TMV flank the heterologous reporter gene [40\".] .",

Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), a hordeivirus, has now been sequenced and found to have a number of interesting properties that illustrate the evolution of these viruses [41. ]. In BSMV, the three domains of sequence similarity to Sindbis virus are encoded on separate gene segments. Remarkably, homologs to the helicase domain found in the Sindbis virus non-structural protein, nsP2, are present on BSMV RNA segments, although only one is required for RNA replication [41-] . Two notable characteristics of hordeiviruses are: that the 3' NT~ combine several motifs from 3' to 5', that is, a tRNA structure, a number of psuedoknots and finally a poly (A) tract adjacent to the end of the ORF (reviewed in [42] ); and that a certain amount of plasticity is apparent in the polymerase, encoded on RNA 3.",

            "text": "Three different forms of RNA 3 were originally identified in different strains of BSMV, although it has now been shown that all three can occur together in certain strains. Form IV contains a deletion in an essential polymerase domain, and is therefore defective and rapidly removed from the population. However, both Form III and Form II, which contain a tandem duplication of 350--370 nucleotides at the amino-temlinus of the ORF for the polymerase, often occur [41. ]. Comparable variation is not seen within the second ORF of RNA 3 which encodes a cysteine-rich polypeptide necessary for systemic infection of plants. Thus, a remarkable series of recombination events were involved in the production of the BSMV genome, and the virus may still be evolving toward an optimal organization. translate two polypeptides from overlapping ORFs in the small segment by initiation at two different AUG codons; and phlebovirus and uukuvirus small segments have two non-overlapping ORFs that are read in opposite orientations (i.e. one is translated from a genome sense mRNA and one from an antigenome sense mRNA) [43] . This strategy, termed 'ambisense', is also found in the bipartite Arenaviridae. Virions of Bunyaviridae with ambisense small segments contain small segment RNA of both polarities (although not in equal concentrations), but their medium segment RNA is all negative strand. At the 3' termini of the three Bunyaviridae RNA segments there are short nucleotide sequences (10-12 residues in length) that are conserved within a given genus and that are complementary to conserved sequences at the 5' termini such that the RNAs can form panhandles. It has been suggested that these sequences are promoter elements for the initiation of RNA synthesis, and that in a mixed infection only Bunyaviridae with identical or nearly identical termini would be replicated by the same polymerase. This would imply that only members of the same genus can exchange genome segments. Nine out of 10 of the terminal nucleotides are identical for phleboviruses and uukuviruses. In addition, sequence similarities have been found in the amino acid sequences of the N proteins and GI and G2 glycoproteins of these two genera. Surprisingly, the terminal sequence for the tenuiviruses is 90% identical to uukuviruses, suggesting that these two groups are very closely related, but the termini of tospoviruses bear no relationship to the termini of any other bunyavirus. All of these characteristics lead us to suggest that, despite their ambisense strategy, the tospoviruses have diverged significantly from other Bunyaviridae, in contrast to tenuiviruses, which may be very closely related to Bunyaviridae, despite their distinct morphology. Furthermore, we propose that the viral phleboviruses and uukuviruses belong to a single genus.",

Because most RNA virus genomes are small, perhaps limited by the inherent error frequency caused by RNA replication without proofreading, RNA viruses are quite efficient, and have evolved a range of mechanisms by which to expand the available coding capacity and differentially regulate their gene products. These include translating more than one reading frame starting at different initiation sites, differential splicing of mRNAs during transcription, and production of multiple mRNAs in which the reading frame has been shifted by the insertion of non-templated nucleotides. Furthermore, in at least one system subgenomic mRNAs can replicate independently, and this replication may be an additional important mechanism for regulating the amounts of individual gene products.",

In all cases the three types of shading represent the three possible open reading frames (ORFs) and the cysteine-rich domain is indicated by the asterisks. (a) For the morbillivirus group and the paramyxovirus group I the top two boxes are protein products translated in different frames from an mRNA exactly complementary to the genomic RNA. The third ORF, accessed by the addition of a single non-templated nucleotide during RNA transcription, is shown with dark gray shading. For PIV-3 the addition of two non-templated nucleotides produces a protein with a carboxy-terminal domain in the same frame as the C protein. (b) For paramyxovirus group II the product of the exactly complementary mRNA is the V protein containing the cysteine-rich domain (dark gray shading and asterisks) and the addition of the non-templated nucleotides shifts the frame to produce the P protein.

            "text": "The discovery of plant viruses with segmented negativestrand genomes that are closely related to the animal viruses in the family Bunvaviridae is also of considerable interest for viral taxonomy. The Bunyaviridae have three genome segments of negative-strand RNA. The largest segment encodes the RNA replicase, the medium sized segment encodes the glycoproteins found in the viral envelope, and the smallest segment encodes the nucleocapsid protein. Five genera of Bunyaviridae have been described, which differ from one another in details of their genome organization and sequence, and in their vectors. Nairoviruses and hantaviruses translate a single polypeptide from a single ORF in the small segment; Comparison of the replication strategies of Sindbis virus with tobacco mosaic virus and barley stripe mosaic virus. All domains shaded in the same way have significant amino acid sequence similarity to one another. The open diamond is the termination codon readthrough to produce the polymerase. The Sindbis non-structural proteins nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4 are responsible for RNA replication. Three short sequence motifs are indicated with symbols (see key).",

The taxonomic position of rice stripe virus, the type tenuivirus, is less clear The virion is poorly defined and the infectious material seems to consist of long thin filaments (perhaps circular) containing the polymerase, which are reminiscent of bunyavirus nucleocapsids. The RNA consists of four segments, of which both segment 3, encoding the capsid protein, and segment 4, of unknown func tion, are ambisense[45\",46.-]. The results of Kakutani et al.[46\".] describe the first example of a virus with more than one ambisense segment. Unfortunately, no sequence information is available on the medium or large segment RNAs, which would be expected to show the highest similarity to the comparable RNA segments of Bunyaviridae.",
