No gross abnormalities were reported, and biopsies were obtained from the stomach, mesenteric lymph nodes and jejunum. Histopathology of the gastric biopsy reported the presence of nodular to coalescing infiltrates, which consisted of histiocytes with neutrophils and variable numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells and abundant fibrosis. No multinucleated giant cells or infectious agents were detected (acid-fast and periodic acid Schiff staining were performed). The lymph node histopathology was similar to that of the gastric biopsy, and the small intestinal histopathology suggested mild to moderate lymphocytic enteritis.",

Initially, there had been some improvement (increased appetite and decreased frequency of vomiting) following the introduction of the prednisolone. However, the owner had been unable to administer the metronidazole due to difficulty in medicating the cat, and this also accounted for the change to injectable steroids.",

The disease is typified by systemic proliferation and invasion of tissues by morphologically atypical histiocytes, which occurs simultaneously within multiple sites. This is typically a very aggressive disease, with affected animals showing a rapid clinical course. Infiltrates are commonly identified within the lymph nodes, spleen and liver early in the course of the disease, and the bone marrow later in the course of the disease (Moore and Rosin 1986) . Reports of malignant histiocytosis in the cat amount to only seven cases (Court et al 1993 , Freeman et al 1995 , Walton et al 1997 , Fritz et al 1999 , Kraje et al 2001 . The ages of the affected cats ranged from 1 to 13 years, with weight loss, inappetence and lethargy being common presenting signs. The course of the disease was rapid, with euthanasia being performed between 2 and 7 weeks after onset of clinical signs. In the cases reported previously, anaemia, splenomegaly and icterus were consistent findings, with thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinaemia and hyperglycaemia being seen frequently. In the three cases where clotting times (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time) were performed, they were found to be prolonged (Kraje et al 2001) .",
