Originally concerned with disease and its emergence, virus evolution had not been well integrated into the general study of evolution. This chapter reviews the developments that have brought us to this new appreciation for the general signifi cance of virus evolution to all life. We now know that viruses numerically dominate all habitats of life, especially the oceans. Theoretical developments in the 1970s regarding quasispecies, error rates, and error thresholds have yielded many practical insights into virus-host dynamics. The human diseases of HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus cannot be understood without this evolutionary framework. Yet recent developments with poliovirus demonstrate that viral fi tness can be the result of a consortia, not one fi ttest type, a basic Darwinian concept in evolutionary biology. Darwinian principles do apply to viruses, such as with Fisher population genetics, but other features, such as reticulated and quasispecies-based evolution distinguish virus evolution from classical studies.

Missing from many of these considerations has been the major role played by persisting viruses in stable virus evolution and disease emergence. In many cases, extreme stability is seen with persisting RNA viruses. Indeed, examples are known in which it is the persistently infected host that has better survival. We have also recently come to appreciate the vast diversity of phage (DNA viruses) of prokaryotes as a system that evolves by genetic exchanges across vast populations (Chapter 10). This has been proposed to be the \" big bang \" of biological evolution. In the large DNA viruses of aquatic microbes we see surprisingly large, complex and diverse viruses. With both prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses, recombination is the main engine of virus evolution, and virus host co-evolution is common, although not uniform. Viral emergence appears to be an unending phenomenon and we can currently witness a selective sweep by retroviruses that infect and become endogenized in koala bears.",

            "text": "Our understanding of virus evolution has reached a threshold in that it now appears to provide a much broader vista regarding its general signifi cance and infl uence on host evolution. Several developments have brought us to this point. One has been the realization that viruses often evolve by processes involving the collective action of a consortia, or quasispecies. And the resulting adaptability and power of such evolution is unmatched by any other genetic entity. Much of this volume is dedicated to this issue. In such consortia, the concept of a \" wild-type \" virus is no longer considered to be the fi ttest type, as the quasispecies itself provides fi tness (see Chapters 3 and 4). The quasispecies model resembles population genetics in some ways, but it has led to some signifi cant departures from population genetics, and these departures are very well supported by experiments. Another development that has recalibrated our view of the overall signifi cance of viruses is information on the scale and diversity of viruses. Viruses are present at a previously unappreciated global level and appear to have affected the evolution of all life on Earth. Much of this realization has been brought about by the development of metagenomic methods as applied to various habitats. Measurements of major habitats (the oceans, soil, extreme environments) have established that our biological world is predominantly viral, in terms of both numbers and diversity ( Paul et al. , 2002 ; Breitbart et al. , 2003 ; Rohwer, 2005a, 2005b ; Edwards and Rohwer, 2005 ; Comeau et al. , 2006 ) .",

The last 30 years have been very active regarding virus evolution.

However, since viruses are molecular genetic parasites that are inscrutable by casual observation, our understanding of virus evolution has been dependent upon measuring sequence variation and sequence diversity in a large number of virus genomes. Because of this, these small genetic parasites have been the last domain of life to yield their secrets of evolution. And viruses harbor some clearly distinct evolutionary abilities. For one, they are polyphyletic. All major viral lineages have their own distinct origins. They are also difficult if not impossible to defi ne as species and are able to exchange genetic information across normal boundaries. Even \" dead \" and defective viruses can participate in such exchanges, which confuses the defi nitions of fi tness. We now know that viruses can evolve by a consortia process and also exchange information by recombination across vast genetic pools to assemble new mosaic combinations of genes. We thus no longer think of a specifi c genetic lineage in understanding virus evolution, but instead think of a cloud, matrix, or a population as the basis of virus evolution. Viruses are inherently fuzzy entities that can differ from their relatives in any specifi c feature. Yet even with such fuzziness, it is clear that common themes also link them. Patterns of evolution have become clear. Diversity and variation are often (but not always) observed. Stability and host congruence can also be observed. Nevertheless, the evolutionary power of viruses has been learned at a human cost.",

Yet these methods struggle to incorporate the fuzzy nature of viruses and have clear limits, especially regarding quasispecies and high recombination rates. Structural biology now also adds tools that extend our vision of virus evolution beyond what can be seen in the genetic sequence. For example, common structural motifs from phage to eukaryotic DNA viruses (T4 and herpesvirus) suggest very ancient links in virus evolution that span all domains of life (see below). Nevertheless, our analytical methods are currently lacking as we struggle to understand complex genetic mixtures that provide fi tness, reticulated relationships, polyphyletic origins, and virus-host congruence. Virus evolution has, for the most part, been considered to be a specifi c, esoteric part of broader evolutionary biology and has been given limited attention in reference works on evolutionary biology (see Pagel, 2002 ) . Historically, the focus has been on various RNA viruses and some DNA viruses that cause disease in humans and domesticated animals and plants . However, I have asserted that all life forms must be examined from the perspective of virus evolution ( Villarreal, 2005 ) , not just those pathogens that impact on us. How viruses evolve in a more general sense informs us of evolutionary paradigms that have not been previously well understood (especially the evolution of consortia or the dynamics of vast reticulated gene pools). This volume now extends these traditional topics of virus evolution to include the vast virology of the prokaryotic world. In so doing, it illuminates the global consequences viruses have had on all life forms.",

Due to this historic success, American health agencies and educators considered virus disease as a thing of the past, no longer a serious threat. The era of infectious disease that they represented was now one for the historical record, an unfortunate part of human history, or so we thought. In what now seems to have been a clear case of hubris and naivety, we have been humbled by the evolutionary power of viruses, which was woefully underappreciated, even by most virologists. By the end of that decade, the evolution and emergence of HIV-1 permanently changed our views (see Chapters 13 and 14) . This has also been followed by a seemingly never-ending series of viral threats as newly emerging viral diseases have come to our attention. HIV-1 provides the only example of a public health situation that has reversed centuries of progress for extending human health and lifespan. It now limits human life expectancy in many parts of the world, especially sub-Saharian Africa. This development could not have been imagined in the 1970s. We are much less confi dent now about predicting the future of virus evolution and its potential impact on human health.",

As we sought to understand the origin of this new virus, we have come to appreciate a much broader virus-host story which involves simian immunodefi ciency virus (SIV), foamy viruses, and the speciation of Old World primates. We have also come to learn that the genomes of these primates show much evidence of past viral interaction and ongoing endogenous retrovirus colonization. The evolution of retroviral endogenization has taken on a much greater signifi cance in basic evolutionary biology. Thus it is with great interest that we now study the ongoing endogenization of retroviruses in the koala bear genome (see below).",

It is therefore understandable that most evolutionary biologists mainly think of viruses strictly as agents of disease. These are the products of run away replicons that provide negative selection to host survival. In this light, the application of predator-prey based mathematical models has seemed most appropriate. With such viral disease, variation has long been observed and was initially used for the generation of most vaccines. However, this disease-centric view has also occluded another more prevalent virus-host relationship. For example the emergence of HIV-1 has led us conclude that it likely evolved from various versions of SIV. But SIV is not pathogenic in its native African primate host. Nor does it show the genetic diversifi cation of HIV-1 in these native primate hosts. It is a silent, asymptomatic infection. Genomic and metagenomic analysis now allows us to identify many more silent, asymptomatic viruses that would not have previously been observed. We now know of many such viruses that are prevalent in a specifi c host.

            "text": "In the last ten years I have attempted to provide another view concerning virus-host evolution. I have argued that viruses often attain evolutionary stability by species-specifi c persistence and that such states apply to all domains of life, including prokaryotes. On an evolutionary time-scale, the majority of viral lineages tend to exist as species-specifi c persistent (aka temperate, latent, and chronic) infections in which individual hosts will be colonized by mostly silent (asymptomatic) viruses for the duration of their life . Such persistence can have major consequences to the evolution of both virus and host, which also leads us to more directly link virus evolution to broader issues of host evolution. It is from this perspective that we start to clearly see that viruses indeed belong on the tree of life as major participants ( Villarreal, 2005 ( Villarreal, , 2006 . Persisting viruses are not simply agents responsible for destruction of life, but are also agents that create genetic novelty on a vast scale that infl uences all life and promotes symbiosis ( Marquez et al. , 2007 ; Ryan, 2007 ; Villarreal, 2007 ) . The persistent lifestyle of such symbiotic virus-host relationships is not simply a less effi cient, acute infection; nor is it simply a \" reservoir \" for acute virus (as epidemiologists are prone to assert). Neither can it be attributable to concepts of selfi sh DNA. Persistence represents a major virus life strategy that is both fundamental and highly adapted. It has distinct genetic, fi tness, and evolutionary characteristics that require intimate, host (tissue)-specifi c viral strategies and precise gene functions to attain stable maintenance in the presence of immunity and to allow biologically controlled reactivation. Persistence also must resist displacement by similar viruses and competitors. It is virus-host persistence that provides the thread that allows us to link these polyphyletic viral lineages (and their clouds) with the entire tree of life. In turn, this link identifi es a much more fundamental role for viruses in the evolution of host, visible from the very earliest to the most recent events in host evolution. It is from such species-specifi c persistent states that the large majority of acute diseases evolve and emerge by various mechanisms.",

In all these proposals, however, it is necessary that the virus in question has attained a stable genomic persistence with its host. These evolutionary events thus seem to be the products of viral-mediated symbiogenesis of host ( Ryan, 2007 ; Villarreal, 2007 ) . Proposals include the possibility that viruses may have originated the DNA replication system of all three cellular domains (archaea, bacteria, eukarya) of life ( Forterre, 1999 ( Forterre, , 2005 ( Forterre, , 2006a ( Forterre, , 2006b Filee et al. , 2003 ; Forterre et al. , 2007 ) . The discovery and analysis of the largest DNA virus (1200 ORF mimivirus), a lytic cytoplasmic virus of amebae (a distant relative of phycodnavirus and poxviruses), has also led to proposals that this virus lineage may represent an ancient fourth domain of life ( Raoult et al. , 2004 ; Desjardins et al. , 2005 ; Claverie et al. , 2006 ) . It is interesting that in an initial structural analysis, the large complex replication centers for mimivirus were confused with the host nucleus ( Suzan-Monti et al. , 2007 ) . Thus, it seems relevant that others have proposed that a distant relative of phycodnaviruses and poxviruses may have originated the eukaryotic nucleus ( Villarreal, 1999 ; Villarreal and DeFilippis, 2000 ; Bell, 2001 Bell, , 2006 Takemura, 2001 ) .",

A virosphere clearly exists but its nature and boundaries are not so clear. Multiple viral origins, their diversity and numerical dominance in distinct and sometimes harsh environments as well as their presence in host genomes suggest that any viral tree of life will be huge, multidimensional, and connected to the host tree of life. As discussed below regarding double-stranded (ds)DNA viruses of prokaryotes, they have all the above characteristics. Such viruses may represent the big bang of biological novelty. With their unmatched capacity to generate diversity they can function as the mass creators of biological novelty as well as destroyers of most species. Surely, such capacity must have had big infl uences on the evolution of life. Symbiosis, simply defi ned, is the stable coexistence of two previously separate lineages of organisms. There can be little doubt that many temperate phage can stably colonize a bacterial cell resulting in a stable descendent from two lineages. This is clearly symbiotic. Endogenous retroviruses can similarly be found to persist in vertebrate genomes and also appear symbiotic. Yet studies of symbiosis seldom consider a role for virus ( Villarreal, 2007 ) .",

That cryptic and defective phage are ubiquitous in the genomes of all prokaryotes is generally considered uninteresting by many in the fi eld of evolutionary biology. I suggest that the seemingly applicable concepts of selfi sh DNA effectively derailed any thinking that persisting genetic parasites might have a more germinal role in the evolution of life ( Doolittle and Sapienza, 1980 ; Orgel and Crick, 1980 ). Yet as outlined above, virus footprints in major evolutionary transitions are clear and a direct role in such events now seems much more plausible.

Autocatalytic chemical reactions, such as replication of RNA, presents issues such as how to optimize a rugged fi tness landscape yet allow the study of evolution in vitro with RNA. RNA in vitro reduces genotype-phenotype issues to RNA secondary structure and minimal free energy states. This allows both continuity and discontinuity to be measured. These same issues are crucial for the study of RNA viruses, whose sites of secondary structure often defi ne replicator identity. These models currently offer the best system to evaluate an early and simple biological world for evolutionary principles (see Chapter 3). Viruses and viroids with their RNA genomes may be the only extant survivors of this pre-DNA world. Since it was the consideration of error-prone replication that led to the development of the concept of quasispecies (see Chapter 2), such models have provided a conceptual foundation which led to several basic concepts. Chapter 4 discussed the foundations and various aspects of quasispecies theory. Viruses appear to operate close to the error threshold, thus allowing maximum evolutionary exploration ( Biebricher and Eigen, 2006 ) . However, as presented below, the loss of the \" fi ttest \" type concept has also led to clear experimental evaluations of consortia-based evolutionary behaviors. Such behaviors were not predicted by classical Darwinian models. Although virologists were initially attracted to quasispecies models, many evolutionary biologists were initially hostile to the application of the quasispecies concept to evolution. It was thought that the classical mathematical models of population biology, as originally developed by Wright and Fisher, and later applied by Kimura and Maruyama to asexual haploid populations at the mutationselection balance, had already fully developed the needed models and precluded additional need for the quasispecies concept. The classical models were thus argued to provide adequate mathematical coverage for viruses, including quasispecies and error threshold ( Wilke, 2005 ) . However, these two approaches differ fundamentally with regard to the signifi cance of error-prone replication and it was the quasispecies approach that led to the clear experimental establishment that quasispecies selection, per se , is important for viral pathology and fi tness (see below).",

Such cooperation is a rare outcome for most models and given the conclusion that early DNA based life was a \" horizontal \" consortium, such models are of special interest. The issue of consortia will come up often. Consortia selection directly implies cooperation, but cooperation of selfi sh replicators presents dilemmas. Replicator networks with interaction functions that give highly non-linear dynamics can result in complex mixtures, with behaviors ranging from survival of the fi ttest to also including attainment of globally stable equilibrium tantamount to permanent coexistence. The fi tness of populations, however, is inherent to current quasispecies concepts in virology. There may also be other ways to explain the genetic origin of cooperation (such as stable persistence involving addiction strategies). The stable persistence of a genetic parasite can compel cooperation and promote the conservation of information (see below).",

Although the concept of relative replicative fi tness is often applied to lab experiments of virus growth, we know many situations in which virus replication is not maximized in natural settings and many viruses can exist in relatively non-replicative states for long periods. Even in the context of an acutely replicating virus in a host organism, the concept of fi tness is clearly conditional, as the virus must replicate through various in vivo habitats that can have opposing selection. As presented below, in vivo models that study fi tness and viral diversity have clearly indicated that diversity per se is important and fi tness is the result of consortia. How do we defi ne such fi tness since the mixture clearly matters? Also, how do we defi ne information content or integrity of a consortia? Currently, we cannot. In the lab, the viability of a virus is usually measured by the ability to produce plaques. This has been a crucial and main assay for many experimental systems that study virus population. Here, the defi nition of fi tness seems direct: plaque formation equals fi tness. Various highly useful models have thus been defi ned and developed that depend on these plaque assays (see Chapter 4). With this, populations and population growth are defi ned as relative growth of plaque-forming units. However, the concept has always been problematic when considered from a natural virology perspective. Plaque formation is clearly not equal to fi tness in natural habitats. There are many examples of highly successful viruses that either plaque poorly or not at all. Consider the roughly 100 types of human papillomavirus (HPV), a simple small circular DNA virus of epithelia; this does not form plaques in any known system (Chapter 18). HPV is clearly fi t, well adapted to, and stable in its human host. In addition, HPV evolution is phylogenetically congruent with their primate host, as are most persistent viral infections.",

HIV infection of humans shows evidence of this in that the R5 virus is more fi t for transmission and early disease whereas the X4 virus is fi t later during the AIDS disease phase. Clearly conditional, time-dependent issues relate to fi tness defi nitions. However, much more problematic is that we have no theory for viral persistence or its fi tness. We lack specifi c or measurable parameters other than the simple maintenance of genetic material. Yet it seems clear that some distinguishing features of persistence can already be recognized. For example, the possible participation of viral defectives (normally considered unfi t), which in numerous circumstances can modify or mediate persistence, would need to be included. Clearly, a defective role in persistence would also preclude them from being considered as genetic \" junk, \" or selfish elements, since they would then matter in measurable ways to the biological outcome of virus persistent infection.",

These studies make clear the importance of quasispecies and error-prone replication. Such detailed in vivo experiments were made possible by a long and detailed history of poliovirus studies that has identifi ed the nature of RNA polymerase fi delity as well as developed mouse models for the study of pathogenesis. Few other virus-host systems could have provided such potential for high resolution. These results also provide the experimental observations that distinguish quasispecies-based evolution from the classical Fisher-based population genetics. The general importance of this story for understanding virus evolution thus deserves special emphasis. The very origins of modern animal virology stem from poliovirus studies with the need to develop in vitro cell culture technology in order to grow and evaluate poliovirus and generate variants. The live poliovirus vaccine is of special interest with regards to virus evolution and adaptability. The \" live \" oral Sabin vaccine can be considered to have been a miracle of the practical approach to virology developed in the 1950s ( Horaud, 1993 ) in that it was used well before our understanding of the relevant evolutionary theory. The Sabin vaccine strain was the result of rodentadapted virus and differs from the neurovirulent Mahoney strain by 56 point mutations (in the consensus sequence), although only a small number of these mutations were needed for neurovirulence ( Christodoulou et al. , 1990 ) . One of the important neurovirulent mutations was within the RNA polymerase gene ( Tardy-Panit et al. , 1993 ) . However, the signifi cance of this observation took many years to unravel and exploit. In time it became apparent that 3Dpol mutants could affect replication fi delity. One poliovirus point mutant, 3DG64S, was shown to have enhanced highfi delity replication and that selective pressure could be designed to increase fi delity in RNA polymerase ( Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2005 ) .",

Although the poliovirus-mouse system provides us with a fi rm experimental result, it seems likely that the generality of this relationship will be questioned by evolutionary biologists for several reasons. For one, this was observed in a lab constructed model system, which, it could be argued, is not an accurate representation of in vivo virus-host fi tness. Also, as mentioned above, group selection is a process that will not readily be accepted as representative by the broader community. Is there any evidence that this result with poliovirus indeed represents a general virus-host evolutionary relationship in natural settings? As presented in Chapters 13-15, retroviruses and also human hepatitis virus C clearly exist as quasispecies populations that affect disease outcome. In the case of the retroviruses, viral populations show diversity that far exceeds that seen for other RNA viruses. In both HIV-1 and HCV there is clear circumstantial evidence for the importance of quasispecies for in vivo disease outcome, drug resistance, and fi tness. In addition, with HCV, CNS infection may sometimes result, and such brain infections appear to be mediated by distinct quasispecies ( Forton et al. , 2004 ; Forton et al. , 2006 ) , reminiscent of the polio virus mouse model. Quasispecies memory, as mentioned above, also seems to be an important issue with regard to failure of antiretroviral therapy ( Kijak et al. , 2002 ) and it appears that pol gene mutations could also be involved in this ( Carobene et al. , 2004 ) . Measurements of HIV quasispecies in individual patients indicates that multiple evolutionary patterns can be found in typical individual patients ( Casado et al. , 2001 ) , thus mixtures of HIV exist in patients ( Bello et al. , 2004 ( Bello et al. , , 2005 . And HIV-1 recombination is clearly contributing to diversity ( Kijak and McCutchan, 2005 ) . Thus, with both HIV-1 and HCV, their capacity to cause human disease is clearly associated with quasispecies compositions that affect fi tness in complex ways. The poliovirus mouse system therefore appears to refl ect quasispecies issues as observed in natural virus-host situations.",

Unlike poliovirus and most RNA viruses, retroviruses (e.g. non-lentivirus) have colonized the genomes of animal species in large numbers and represent a large fraction of these genomes. Genomic retroviruses are present in vast numbers, most of which are defective and mutant copies. In this genomic colonization they resemble the dsDNA viruses of prokaryotes (discussed below) that also colonize all prokaryotes although at a much lower numbers. The human genome has fewer than 26 000 genes, but appears to have 500 000 retroviral-related LTR elements. Some of these elements are intact and conserved (human ERVs (HERVs)) and this genomic population has some clear characteristics of a viral quasispecies. Such large amounts of genetic material have previously been dismissed simply as selfi sh or junk DNA of no fi tness consequences to the host. However, given the importance of quasispecies mutant genomes for viral fi tness and persistence, we might need to re-evaluate this dismissal.

This group of virus includes the coronaviruses (e.g. mouse hepatitis virus and SARS-associated coronavirus), which are the largest RNA viruses known (26-32 kb). It has been proposed that such large genomes have required the adaptation of a high-fi delity RNA polymerase in order to increase the error threshold and accommodate large RNA genomes. Based on the phylogenetics of this polymerase and other RNA-processing enzymes, this group of viruses appears to be monophyletic and it is thought that the acquisition of a high-fi delity RNA replicase was central to the origin of this lineage. This type of replicase is unique to RNA viruses. The monophyletic view stems from an analysis of a small set of conserved genes. Overall, however, these larger genomes have many other genes that show no similarities to related viruses.

In fact six novel coronaviruses were isolated from six different bat species showing an astonishing diversity in bats.

Only one of these bat groups includes SARS and SARS-like coronaviruses that adapted to acute human infections.

Yet, in spite of this usual asymptomatic viral persistence, historically, some zoonotic viral disease outbreaks have occasionally been documented in natural populations. One such early outbreak was an epizootic diarrhea that occurred in infant mice ( Adams and Kraft, 1963 ) . Later, it was established that one such infection was due to mouse hepatitis virus ( Carthew, 1977 ; Ishida et al. , 1978 ) . In spite of this disease outbreak, with MHV, it has since become clear that asymptomatic persistent infections are the norm and are highly stable. Yet MHV disease outbreaks, especially in virus-free mouse facilities, are also common and severe. How does MHV attain such stable and prevalent persistence in natural population yet retain the ability to cause disease in naive populations? What maintains the MHV fi tness of natural persistence?",

I propose that these stable evolutionary states of viral persistence are due to a strategy we can call virus addiction ( Villarreal, 2005 ) and that MHV can provide the exemplar of such a state. With MHV, only persistently infected mice colonies are protected from the disease that is otherwise caused by the virus. In wild asymptomatic mice, MHV is found mostly as an enteric infection. The CNS demyelinated disease that MHV can induce is most observed in newborn pups ( Homberger, 1997 ; Nash et al. , 2001 ) and once in the brain, MHV can persist in CNS with recurring disease ( Marten et al. , 2001 ) . This recurring CNS disease is also associated with quasispecies (in the S gene) and recombination ( Rowe et al. , 1998 ) . The most serious CNS disease is in S-gene variant of MHV-4 (JHM), thus as with the poliomouse model, pathogenic fi tness with MHV is also associated with quasispecies.",

Thus MHV alters mouse molecular identity regarding immunological (T-cell) reactions ( Wilberz et al. , 1991 ) . To establish stable asymptomatic persistence, however, MHV needs to infect newborns ( Weir et al. , 1987 ) , in which acute disease is prevented due to maternal passive immune antibody transfer ( Gustafsson et al. , 1996 ) . Being born to immune mothers thus protects against CNS disease and promotes enteric (not brain) virus colonization.

The need to establish stable persistence could then be providing a strong selection for increased genome complexity and stability and might better explain the selection for the enhanced RNA polymerase fi delity in nidoviruses.

The colony that is persistently infected with MHV will have a distinct advantage over its neighbor as MHV introduced into this uninfected colony will have severe effects on the offspring. Eventually, we can expect only the MHV-harboring colony will prevail in both hay stacks. This is a state I have called virus addiction.

However, even though its human toll is huge, modern medicine and culture has responded rapidly enough to limit the impact of HIV-1 to the point at which it will not likely be the cause of a selective evolutionary sweep that could have altered human genetic makeup (in contrast to the koala bear endogenization presented below). As described earlier, its amazing adaptability via quasispecies along with extensive recombination contribute directly to HIV-1 ' s diversity and makes it the most dynamic genetic entity ever studied. Many studies track the dominant HIV population and fail to examine minority populations. Yet it is precisely these minority populations, which evolve independently of the majority population, that can determine drug resistance phenotype and biological outcome ( Charpentier et al. , 2004 ; Briones et al. , 2006 ; Morand-Joubert et al. , 2006 ) . Clearly, the specifi c makeup of a complex HIV population matters. Furthermore, HIV defectives and variants can also have major consequences. In some cases, long-term non-progressors of HIV-1 have shown mixed populations and unusual polymorphism in the early phase of HIV infection, sometimes contributing to long-term non-progression (LTNP) ( Alexander et al. , 2000 ) . One population of LTNPs was reported to have been colonized by an HIV variant that showed low virus replication and slow or arrested evolution ( Bello et al. , 2005 ) . In another case, a stable non-progressor was colonized by a replication incompetent version of HIV-1 ( Wang et al. , 2003 ) . Some of these non-progressors also appear to resist super-infection . It seems clear that at least in these exceptional situations, non-majority HIVs are crucial to the outcome.",

In natural outbreaks, however, it has also shown surprising genetic stability ( Einer-Jensen et al. , 2006 ) . Clearly error-prone rhabdovirus replication must be kept in check by purifying selection in this situation. In contrast, another rhabdovirus, sigma virus of Drosophila , is associated with no mortality but is a vertically transmitted persisting virus in specifi c Drosophila populations ( Fleuriet, 1996 ) . Yet in some recent population measurements, sigma virus infected Drosophila are expanding for unknown reasons ( Fleuriet, 1994 ) . Clearly this particular virus-host persistent relationship has some undefi ned selective advantage that operates beyond the lab-based concepts as measured above. Other rhabdoviruses also have peculiar host-specifi c relationships, such as bats that tend to support many persistent infections ( Badrane and Tordo, 2001 ; Li et al. , 2005 ) , or birds that seem to be free of almost all rhabdoviruses.

Due to its history and potential for initiating great human epidemics, it has long held the special interest of evolutionary virologists (see Chapter 5; Nelson and Holmes, 2007 ) . However, this research has not much emphasized the quasispecies character of infl uenza virus evolution. Instead, it concentrates on the evolution of the master template or clades of template for the purposes of vaccine development ( Webster and Govorkova, 2006 ) . The views stemming from this type of evolution have lent themselves well to master template-based phylogenetic analysis and have dominated how many researchers think of virus-host evolution. Thus it is curious, given the above emphasis, that the quasispecies character of infl uenza populations often seems of low relevance to issues of acute disease and vaccination, other then to provide a source of diversity. In some situations, viral competitive interference may contribute to drift variation and displacement in antigenic epitopes ( Levin et al. , 2004 ).

However, by shear numbers of infections and deaths worldwide, it must be admitted that infl uenza virus is really a virus that affects mostly birds. For example, during the 2005 outbreak in China, only 251 humans died whereas 230 million domestic birds died ( Smith et al. , 2006 ) . Although our concern on the large potential for human disease is understandable, these numbers should inform us of a more basic virushost biology. In this case, infl uenza shows a high affi nity for various birds; migratory water birds in particular can have high prevalence ( Wallensten et al. , 2006 ) . Some waterfowl, such as wild mallard ducks, have been called the stealth (asymptomatic) carriers of infl uenza H5N1 and free grazing ducks seem to introduce virus into domestic bird populations ( Gilbert et al. , 2006 ) . Thus waterfowl represent the well-accepted epidemiological concept of a reservoir species ( Louz et al. , 2005 ) . But these wild waterfowl, shorebirds, and gulls that are a natural host for avian infl uenza also seem to show a much slower rate of evolution ( Spackman et al. , 2005 ) . In contrast, the much higher rate of evolution as seen in chickens and turkeys indicates that these hosts should not be considered as natural reservoirs ( Suarez, 2000 ) . In waterfowl, infl uenza infections show several distinctions, such as virus co-infection or virus interference ( Sharp et al. , 1997 ) as well as phylogenetically distinguishable waterfowl dendograms, including specifi c M lineages ( Makarova et al. , 1998 ; Widjaja et al. , 2004 ) .

Thus, we have often been able to make informed judgments concerning broader patterns of virus evolution and this has become the major tool for the current study of virus evolution, such as infl uenza virus ( Nelson and Holmes, 2007 ) . Infl uenza A, for example can be seen to show extended periods of stasis followed by periods of rapid adaptation that necessitates adaptations in vaccine strategy ( Wolf et al. , 2006 ) . However, the evolutionary variation between seemingly similar viruses can be surprisingly large (see above VSV section). For example, the very different phylogenetic behaviors between infl uenza A and measles virus, both acute human respiratory infections due to membrane-bound negative-stranded RNA viruses, are striking. The reasons for the maintained genetic stability of measles virus remain poorly understood, but may well involve more complex fi tness associated with systemic infections. Phylogenetic methods can also be highly informative regarding the likely origins of viral lineages and possible sources of emergence. For example, the studies of dengue virus by Holmes and colleagues suggest that this virus fi rst entered its human host about 1000 years ago, and that sylvatic (African jungle) asymptomatic infection of primates may have provided the origin of this virus that later became a human pathogen ( Holmes and Twiddy, 2003 ; Holmes, 2006 ) . Such insight provides valuable clues concerning the likely selective pressures that may lead to the emergence of dengue virus. Phylogenetic methods are also highly informative regarding classifi cation and taxonomy relationships and have allowed us to understand viral relationships across broad species defi nitions ( Zanotto et al. , 1996 ) .",

They were not developed to access the evolutionary relationship and fi tness of interacting mixtures.

Without such tools, however, it seems we can only evaluate those parameters we can defi ne and will remain confused by those we cannot.

It is also clear that the subviral elements of even a single viral lineage can greatly affect the virus-host relationship. Such subviral elements (DIs) have been observed to both reduce and intensify disease, and also interact with satellite viruses ( Qiu and Scholthof, 2001 ) , thus virus-virus interactions are clearly crucial in many situations ( Simon et al. , 2004 ) and viral interactions and synergism appear to have led to signifi cant events in plant virus emergence ( Fargette et al. , 2006 ) .",

In addition, as discussed in Chapter 10, it is now clear that some of these viruses are surprisingly complex and that essentially the entire pool of dsDNA viruses of prokaryotes may be exchanging DNA via recombination at high rates. This would constitute by far the largest common gene pool on Earth. Historically, the evolution of the DNA viruses of prokaryotes has seldom been considered in the broader context of virus evolution or evolutionary biology. Although it has long been realized that there are many basic similarities between viruses of bacteria and eukaryotes ( Luria et al. , 1959 ) , not until structural studies solved the capsid genes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses did the evolutionary relationships between these viruses become clear. In addition, there have been a number of striking proposals that suggest that DNA viruses of prokaryotes may be involved in the origin of several major systems used by cells and that viruses appear to be involved in several major transitions during host evolution. Thus we now consider the possibility that these DNA phage were fundamental to the origin and evolution of life on Earth.",

In addition, phage PRD1 and adenoviruses show similar broad structural and strategic conservation. Some biochemical (DNA pol family) and genetic similarities (gene order, gene programming) are also apparent, which taken together supports the common origins of these viruses ( Hendrix, 1999 ( Hendrix, , 2002 Hendrix et al. , 1999 Hendrix et al. , , 2003 . T4-like viruses in particular seem to represent a major source of global genetic diversity. This giant genetic pool represents a huge potential to affect life ( Filee et al. , 2005 ) and the viral genetic creativity represented by this pool would also be vast ( Nolan et al. , 2006 ) .

According to this view, early cellular life was completely entangled with viral (phage) lineages; hence cells must have evolved from an ancestral \" virus \" -mediated population not a single genetic lineage. Thus the evolution of early life would have clear similarity to the quasispecies (consortia) state of genetic information as seen in RNA viruses above. Thus the huge creative and adaptive potential of virus would have been directly involved in the very earliest evolution of life. Clearly, such conjectures regarding the most ancient events in the evolution of life are hard to substantiate. But, these theories are as viable as any other and deserve serious consideration.",

Yet even with T4-like viruses, there can be clear barriers to horizontal gene transfer which promote the evolution of stable viral lineages ( Filee et al. , 2006a ) . In T4-type phage, 24 similar core genes could be seen in all genomes, which seem to be inherited in gene blocks that preclude recombination. However, these blocks were not seen in the broader T-even and pseudo T-even genomes. Other phage also show surprising genetic stability when repeatedly isolated from similar habitats, such as soil phages of Burkholderia ( Summer et al. , 2006 ) and Bam35 ( Saren et al. , 2005 ) as well as some hot spring isolates ( Khayat et al. , 2005 ) . This Bam35 capsid also identifi es another structural motif mentioned above that is broadly conserved in evolution and shows clear similarity to that capsids found in PRD1 and PBCV-1 (discussed below). SH1 also has a clear PRD1related capsid, membrane, and genome; thus this halophilic euryarchaeon virus, although showing no sequence similarity to PRD1 or any other bacterial phage, is clearly structurally related ( Bamford et al. , 2005a ) .",

Fitness of temperate phage, however, is more complicated then that of a lytic virus and, like fi tness of persistence discussed above, cannot be simply described by relative replication or effi cient virion production. Here too, successful phage colonization must inherently limit the replication of the same virus. Thus, a temperate lifestyle also requires an autoinhibitory capacity. This generally involves an immunity gene set that not only limits self-replication but can also affect replication of other temperate and lytic viruses, i.e. lambda (even as a defective) precludes T4 and other T-even phage. Uncolonized hosts are thus susceptible to lysis by highly prevalent acute tailed phage. Host fi tness is thus strongly affected by a temperate phage due to its ability to preclude and survive other competing phage. I suggest this situation is similar to the MHV-mouse exemplar above, in that virus-colonized hosts are in a state of \" virus addiction \" in which persistence is needed to provide protection from the same or similar virus ( Villarreal, 2005 ( Villarreal, , 2006 .",

P1 encodes several gene pairs (toxins/ antitoxins, such as the PhD/DOC pair) that protect bacteria harboring P1, but kill daughter bacteria that have lost the P1 genome ( Gazit and Sauer, 1999 ) . This strategy compels colonized E. coli to maintain P1 or die (DOC, death on curing).

From such a perspective, viral novelity would seen of little relevance to host evolution. Metagenomic projects as noted above, have sequenced nearly 2 million phage genomes and report that most of these phage genes are unique, not in the database, and likely not derived from host ( Edwards and Rohwer, 2005 ) . The protein repertoire of sequenced phage indicates that 80% of conserved phage genes are specifi c to phage and show an evolutionary independence from genes of host . This identifi es a massive genetic novelty from virus, which is especially apparent in large DNA phage. As just discussed above, however, those hosts that live are also products of phage selection, and persisting temperate phage play a major role in this. Such phage colonization allows this massive phage novelty to fi nd its way into host genomes, which allows viral complex gene sets to be applied to novel problems of host adaptation. Host novelty can thus be introduced by phage ( Comeau and Krisch, 2005 ) .",

Cyanobacteria ( Prochlorococcus ) is major model for the study of the origin of the type II (plant-like) photosynthetic system.

Parvovirus evolution (see Chapter 17) can show a sharp contrast to the evolutionary pattern displayed by other small dsDNA viruses above (HPV, Py). With the emergence of an acute pandemic in domestic dogs and cats (as well as other wild carnivore species), we see what is essentially evolution driven by single point mutations, mostly affecting the capsid genes and host cell receptor binding. This system provides us with one of the better studied examples of the evolutionary dynamics of an emergent viral disease. In addition, in vivo mouse studies with minute virus of mouse (MVM) now make it clear that parvoviruses can behave much like RNA viruses, generating quasispecies of diverse progeny that allow a high adaptability for the generation of fi tness and disease in vivo ( Lopez-Bueno et al. , 2006 ) . This story is very reminiscent of the study of poliovirus in mice mentioned above.

These large, complex dsDNA membrane-containing icosahedral viruses are abundant in some water habitats ( Van Etten, 2003 ; Ghedin and Claverie, 2005 ) . The reason they deserve special attention is that they clearly have many features that are characteristic of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses. They resemble prokaryotic viruses in that their life cycle is clearly phagelike, such as external virion attachment, injection of DNA and no pinocytosis. In addition, they also encode many phage-like genes, such as restriction-modifi cation enzymes and homing endonucleases ( Filee et al. , 2006c ) . They also resemble eukaryotic viruses in that they have eukaryotic DNA replication proteins (DNA polymerase beta and PCNA; Chen and Suttle, 1996 ; Nagasaki et al. , 2005 ; Villarreal and DeFilippis, 2000 ) as well as many genes associated with eukaryotic signal transduction ( Van Etten et al. , 2002 ) . Thus they represent a clear link between prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA viruses. For example, the DNA polymerase of paramecium bursaria chlorella virus (PBCV-1) is the most conserved gene and most closely resembles that found in human herpesvirus and is distantly related to the similar family DNA pol encoded by T4. This polymerase is distinct from that of the poxviruses or PRD1/adenoviruses (associated with protein-primed DNA replication). However, numerous other genes of the phycodnaviruses are similar to some genes found in the mimiviruses (giant DNA virus of ameba), including the presence of conserved intenes in the DNA pol gene ( Ogata et al. , 2005 ) .",

However, not all phycodnaviruses are lytic. Another lineage of phycodnaviruses is represented by two viruses of fi lamentous brown algae, EsV-1 and FirrV-1 ( Delaroque et al. , 2003 ) . Unlike the lytic phycodnaviruses noted above, these two viruses are \" temperate phage \" like. That is they exist as silent viruses whose DNA is integrated into the germlines of their host. In this, they are unique to all known eukaryotic DNA viruses; host chromosome integration is a normal part of their persistent life strategy. EsV-1 has a 335 593-bp genome and encodes 231 likely genes ( Delaroque et al. , 2001 ) . These genes are mostly unique and only 28 are clearly related to PBCV-1 genes. The gene differences include many replication genes and their gene order is completely different. Like the temperate phage-host evolutionary relationship outlined above, it would be most interesting to understand how the integration of these large DNA viruses has affected host evolution.",

They show clear linkages by structure and function to both phage and various eukaryotic DNA viruses. They also show major variation and novelty in their own genetic composition, including their core genes. In addition, they show clear relationships to distinct and seemingly separate viral lineages (adenoviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses, iridoviruses). The picture we are left with is that they seem to resemble phage evolution in that they appear to have evolved from a diverse pool that has exchanged many basic viral features and created many new genes. This view, however, contrasts sharply with the work of Iyer et al. (2001 Iyer et al. ( , 2006 . By considering the small number of conserved genes in four families of eukaryotic DNA viruses (poxviruses, asfarviruses, iridoviruses, phycodnaviruses), they suggest that these viruses are monophyletic, evolving from a common nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) with an icosahedral capsid.",

The main problem is that it fails to acknowledge the clear link between prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses. Furthermore, by focussing on a small set of related genes, it represents a traditional perspective as found in evolutionary biology that assumes a common (fi ttest) linear lineage, not a cloud, cooperative, or mosaic pool as the main source of novelty resulting in the matrix pattern of virus evolution. The virosphere is clearly not disconnected from itself, but it is also clearly not a linear or tree-like evolutionary system as suggested above.

Such enormously distant relationships, however, cannot now be measured by any reliable metric. Although herpes-like viruses are found in invertebrates (such as ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1)) in both lytic and asymptomatic states ( Barbosa-Solomieu et al. , 2005 ) , our interest in their evolution has been mainly focussed on the vertebrate herpesviruses. Vertebrate herpesvirus do tend to show clear sequence conservation that suggests broad patterns of evolution. One interesting feature of this evolution is the apparent link between the biology of the virus and its evolution. A common, but not universal pattern is that of virus and host co-evolution ( McGeoch et al. , 2000 ( McGeoch et al. , , 2006 McGeoch and Gatherer, 2005 ) .

PBCV-1 also encodes a dUTPase that has the highly conserved motif III ( Zhang et al. , 2005 ) . Many phage are also known to encode dUTPases of diverse types, such as B. subtilis (SPbeta) ( Persson et al. , 2005 ) , and a phage of Thermus thermophilus ( Naryshkina et al. , 2006 ) . This Thermus phage (phiYS40) is of special note since its dUTPase gene is clearly related to the dUTPases of eukaryotic viruses and has a version that has undergone multiple events of recombination from apparently distinct phage, exactly as expected for mosaic phage genes.",

Also, phage phiKZ has a highly conserved TS ( Mesyanzhinov et al. , 2002 ), yet this virus lacks a DNA polymerase or other replication proteins, clearly indicating that the viral TS genes has a basic viral role. Similarly, the cytokines-like genes (such as IL-10) as found in poxviruses and herpesviruses appear to have originated in at least three independent events prior to the divergence of mammalian eutherian orders.

In this analysis, only a few genes of recent origin could be identifi ed as possibly having been transferred between virus and host (e.g. new genes found at tips of phylogenetic dendograms). Thus, gene gain in the herpesviruses (as in DNA phage and phycodnavirus) is prevalent but the origination of such genes from the host is not prevalent.

Conservation of such replication similarities clearly suggests ancestral relationships, but no sequence similarity can be seen between these viruses. The similarity between poxvirus and PBCV-1 DNA replication deserves some additional comment. PBVC-1 and herpesvirus have very similar DNA polymerase genes, yet differ fundamentally in replication strategy. Furthermore, the poxviral DNA polymerase gene is very different from that found in the herpesviruses. Yet, the PBCV-1 capsid was clearly similar to that of adenoviruses and PRD1 phage (and iridovirus capsids). How then do we link poxvirus evolution to other more ancient DNA viruses, such as PBCV-1 which has the same DNA replication mechanism, but distinct replication proteins? Such observations might seem confusing, but they are clearly consistent with mosaic, reticulated evolution of DNA viruses. Various distinct phage lineages can link in multiple ways to various distinct eukaryotic DNA viruses. The concept of a net or matrix rather than a tree is thus a better way to describe the broad topology of DNA virus evolution.",

Typically, we seek to understand poxviruses evolution from the perspective of pathogenesis, such as the origin of human-specifi c smallpox virus. With the comparative genomics of several orthopoxviruses now possible, we see curious overall patterns of gene loss in their evolution ( Randall et al. , 2004 ) . For example, comparing human smallpox to cowpox DNA (a rodent virus that is phylogenetically basal to smallpox), we observe an overall diminution of gene content in smallpox virus. Several poxviruses seem to have also lost genes relative to cowpoxvirus, especially genes that appear to affect immunity ( Hughes and Friedman, 2005 ) . I suggest that this evolutionary tendency for gene reduction is associated with a switch from a more demanding species-specifi c persistent life strategy to a less demanding, acute life strategy in a new host. Cowpox is a naturally persistent infection in rodents (bank voles) ( Feore et al. , 1997 ; Chantrey et al. , 1999 ) , which has been called a natural virus reservoir ( Hazel et al. , 2000 ) . Smallpox is a strictly acute and human-specifi c disease. Such gene loss in association with lost persistence could be a general situation and might also explain why clinical isolates of human cytomegalovirus isolates show a strong tendency to delete genes with passage in culture ( Davison et al. , 2003 ) .",

The enotomopoxviruses are particularly prevalent in grasshopper and locust species, often in unapparent states. Interestingly, within these viruses we can fi nd examples of major shifts in core replication genes, such as the family of DNA pol gene that is used (a shift from DNA pol X to DNA pol B in two entomopoxvirus lineages). We can recall that the DNA pol B gene closely resembles that found in phycodnaviruses (and herpesvirus), but is distinct from that in orthopoxvirus ( Zhu, 2003 ) . We also see in the entomopoxviruses some clear links to phage genes, such as T4-like RNA ligase found in all entomopoxviruses ( Ho and Shuman, 2002 ) as well as a lambdalike integrase seen in D1EPV ( Hashimoto and Lawrence, 2005 ) .

Viral involvement in symbiosis is a foreign idea to many and possibly presents a fundamentally different view of the role viruses may have in host evolution. A major role for persisting (temperate, cryptic) viruses in the evolution of prokaryotes is no longer a controversial idea. Thus, at least in the prokaryotic world, virus persistence can be accepted as adaptive. In eukaryotes, however, viral persistence is seldom considered adaptive. The MHV-mouse exemplar as presented above has suggested how persistence can directly affect host survival. Can this be considered an example of symbiosis in the accepted sense?",

This slug harbors an unusual endogenous retrovirus which is expressed in large numbers during sexual reproduction, following which all slugs die via synchronized apoptosis and in which the chloroplasts have accumulated numerous viral particles ( Pierce et al. , 1999 ; Mondy and Pierce, 2003 ) .

It has been experimentally well established the enJSRV env is essential for sheep embryo implantation ( Dunlap et al. , 2006a ( Dunlap et al. , , 2006b . enJSRV is the endogenous version of JSRV, a problematic sheep-specifi c retrovirus that induces lung tumors (responsible for the death of Dolly, the famous fi rst cloned sheep). The endogenous virus (enJSRV) is present in 20 copies in the sheep genome and all sheep have this virus. Sheep genomes also encoded a trans -dominant enJRSV gag that is inhibitory to exogenous JSRV ( Mura et al. , 2004 ; Oliveira et al. , 2006 ; Murcia et al. , 2007 ) . It seems clear that this situation can also be considered from the perspective of viral symbiosis and/or virus addiction in host evolution. We should thus seek to understand why colonization by an ERV population might generally provide a good solution to the evolutionary demands of placental biology.",

            "text": "There are many other opportunities to examine the potential role of persistent and symbiotic viruses in the evolution of viruses, animals, primates, and humans. For example, as we seek to understand the origins of the adaptive immune system we should pay attention to viral footprints. We can ask, for example, why the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, the most polymorphic, diverse, and rapidly evolving gene set in our chromosome, is so densely colonized with retroviral elements ( Andersson et al. , 1998 ) . Why is a retrovirus also the basic element of the duplication unit that was thought to have been the progenitor for the expansion of the MHC class I (and II) genes ( Gaudieri et al. , 1997 ; Kulski et al. , 1998 Kulski et al. , , 2005 ? Why do similar HERV element (L and 16) also differentiate between human and chimpanzee MHC I ( Watkins, 1995 ; Kulski et al. , 1999 ) ? What was the role for SIV in the evolution of primate MHC ( Vogel et al. , 1999 ) ? Humans and primates appear to have undergone some signifi cant and relatively recent evolution with regard to their endogenous and exogeneous retroviruses. Along these lines, APOBEC-like genes are basic component of the adaptive immune response but they are also antiretroviral genes that act on retroviral cDNA and gag ( OhAinle et al. , 2006 ) . The APOBEC3 antiviral system has expanded recently in humans, but not chimpanzees ( Sawyer et al. , 2004 ; OhAinle et al. , 2006 ) . Why? All African primates support unapparent foamy viruses (and also SIV co-infection), but not humans ( Murray and Linial, 2006 ) . APOBEC3C is active against foamy viruses ( Delebecque et al. , 2006 ) . Old World primates also underwent an expansion of ERVL colonization (a clear relative of foamy virus) ( Sawyer et al. , 2004 ) . Was this ERVL colonization of relevance to the ancient co-speciation of simian foamy virus and their primate host ( Switzer et al. , 2005 ) ? What exactly was the relevance of HERV endogenization to human survival and adaptations?",

            "text": "As noted, all primates, but especially humans show much evidence of recent endogenization by retroviruses. But these events mostly occurred in our extinct ancestors and we do not see ongoing evidence that any HERVs remain active. However, we are currently witnessing a related virus-host evolutionary event of considerable interest. Koala bears, native marsupials of Australia, are currently experiencing a major epidemic caused by a leukemiainducing retrovirus. As a consequence, they are undergoing massive endogenization by a gammaretrovirus (MLV-related). This virus is similar to Gibbon ape leukemia virus, but most likely originated from rodent ancestry ( Tarlinton et al. , 2006 ; Fiebig et al. , 2006 ) . The expectation is that extinction awaits those koalas that do not adapt or endogenize the retrovirus successfully ( Stoye, 2006 ) . This event has the appearances of a retroviral-driven addiction that will result in a genetic variant of koala bear that has acquired a new antiretroviral state. This seems equivalent to the expansion of human APOBEC3; or perhaps a closer analogy is the endogenization of a suppressive gag as occurred with enJSRV. The surviving koala bears will likely tolerate or be persistently infected with this retrovirus pool. The genome of the species will have undergone considerable (but unpredictable) genetic perturbations and likely contain a large pool of variant and defective retrovirus. However, in so doing, the descendent koalas will likely present a biological hazard to any koala species that remain virus-free (as in virus addiction). Currently, one island colony of koalas is suffi ciently isolated to have remained virus-free. This population will henceforth be under persistent threat from populations of endogenized koalas, now favored by group selection. From the very earliest events in evolution of prebiotic replicators to very recent events in human evolution, including the emergence of human-specifi c HIV, we expect viral evolution to show profound effects on the evolution of all life. Unlike accepted host evolution, viruses also employ consortia and mixed populations to evolve, sometimes at unprecedented rates. Thus viruses have informed us of quasispecies, group dynamics, and group selection in evolution. Virus evolution should now be considered as basic science, not just a medical concern. We must acknowledge that the tree of life cannot be properly understood without virus evolution. This book helps to lay the foundation for such understanding.",
