Since Sept. 2001, however, the United States has undertaken a comprehensive reevaluation of its preparedness and the resources necessary to amass a response to critical events, particularly those posed by various forms of terrorism. The 2.7 million nurses registered to practice in the United States [1] represent a significant resource. This resource must be a core component of any national preparedness plan. To be effective, however, nursing must evaluate and enhance its own capabilities to respond to such events. Subsequently, nursing education must prepare nurses to fulfill this critical role.",

Likewise, most health care institutions previously did not recognize the need or importance of requiring nurses and other health care professionals to receive training related to MCIs or had trained only a select group as part of an emergency response team.

The goals of INCMCE include: Increasing the awareness and knowledge of all nurses about MCIs Influencing research efforts designed to improve nursing care and responses to MCIs Monitoring legislation and regulatory policies related to mass casualty education (MCE) Increasing effectiveness of all nurses responding to MCIs Prior to September 2001, INCMCE had identified the first of these goals as the number one priority and issued a media release on nursing's important role in MCIs.
