Indeed, the need to conduct corroborative studies has now become official editorial policy for at least 2 journals, and several more are considering introducing such a policy. The issue of corroborating microarray data is a challenging one-there are good arguments for and against conducting such experiments. However, we believe that the introduction of a fixed requirement to corroborate microarray data, especially if adopted by more journals, is overly burdensome and may, in at least several applications of microarray technology, be inappropriate. We also believe that, in cases in which corroborative studies are deemed essential, a lack of clear guidance leaves researchers unclear as to what constitutes an acceptable corroborative study. Guidelines have already been outlined regarding the details of conducting microarray experiments. We propose that all stakeholders, including journal editorial boards, reviewers, and researchers, should undertake concerted and inclusive efforts to address properly and clarify the specific issue of corroborative data. In this article we highlight some of the thorny and vague areas for discussion surrounding this issue. We also report the results of a poll in which 76 life science journals were asked about their current or intended policies on the inclusion of corroborative studies in papers containing microarray data.

For example, a relatively straightforward experimental objective may be a determination if a certain microbial species is present in a water or tissue sample. This approach was recently used to help pinpoint the nature of the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome [4] . Microarray experiments are more commonly used for either class comparison or class prediction [5] . In class comparison, genes that are expressed differentially in different types of samples are identified. A commonly reported approach has been to use gene expression patterns as a ''fingerprint'' to identify exposure of a tissue to a particular chemical class [6] [7] [8] . Such fingerprints have also been used to differentiate between different types and stages of neoplastic disease [5, 9] as well as nonneoplastic diseases and episodes such as stroke, seizures, hypoglycemia, and hypoxia [10] . Others have taken this approach a step further, into class prediction. By comparing expression profiles from treated and control samples with specific adverse outcomes, it has been possible to use microarray data to identify gene expression fingerprints that predict toxicity [11] , response to drug treatment [12] , or disease outcome [13] .",

However, because the process of producing, using, and analyzing a microarray involves many discrete steps, there is ample opportunity for technical variability to swamp the biological variation that the tool intends to measure. Another significant concern is that each of the many steps of a microarray-based study can be, and often is, conducted differently between laboratories. Layer these methodological permutations on top of inherent biological and technological variation, and the result is a quality assurance/quality control challenge of utmost difficulty. Indeed, the current methods of conducting and reporting microarray data make it almost impossible for researchers to verify the veracity of data derived by another group.",

(2) In the same vein, many genes have splice and tissue variants. Recent analyses of alternative splicing indicates that 40 -60% of human genes may have alternative splice forms [26] . In extreme cases such as MDM2, more than 40 different splice variants have been identified [27] . It is probably important, therefore, to determine first if variants of a gene exist, what tissues they exist in, which variant of a gene is on one's array, and which, if any, of the other variants will hybridize to that particular probe. (3) Until recently, most ''homemade'' microarrays were printed with cDNAs, often amplified from IMAGE clones. Though these are now being replaced by long and short oligonucleotides [28] , cDNA-based arrays have left these contemporary microarrays with a legacy of suspicion. This distrust is based on studies such as that of Halgren et al. [29] , who reported that only 62% of IMAGE clones purchased from a commercial vendor were uncontaminated and contained cDNA inserts that had significant sequence identity to published data for the ordered clones. Even the use of sequence-verified clone libraries may not be enough to prevent the introduction of significant errors during the production of a microarray. One study found that by the time the PCR products from one such library were ready for printing, only 79% of the clones matched the original vendor database. Some of this error appeared to arise from mistakes in the vendor database itself, while the rest was introduced in the preparation of PCR products for printing [30] . (4) Sequence problems have not been limited to cDNA clone stocks. Both commercial and noncommercial institutions are now producing oligonucleotide probes to use internally or sell in the form of premade arrays or print-ready oligonucleotide sets. Such institutions often rely in whole or in part on publicly available sequence data to design these probe sets. At least one high-profile problem resulted from the use of such data. In this case Affymetrix, an acknowledged innovator and leader in the microarray field, encountered problems when it used public sequence data to design probes for its mouse chips [31] . It was later discovered that the sequence data were inaccurate and that a significant proportion of probes on the affected chips were incorrect. (5) The general concern that the complex multiplex hybridization reaction on such a miniature scale can create unknown or unforeseen hybridization kinetics that can yield false positive or false negative results. It is indeed a tall order to design hundreds to thousands of probes that permit an equal number of discriminating hybridization reactions to occur under identical conditions.",

Over the past 5 years this uncertainty has translated into increasingly numerous calls for microarray data to be corroborated in some manner, increasing the burden for researchers who have chosen to invest in the technique. Where they have not been performed, corroborative studies to support microarray data are often called for by journal editors and reviewers before a paper will be accepted for publication. Unfortunately, these calls in many cases appear rather arbitrary. A combination of personal experience (as authors and reviewers), anecdotal comments from colleagues, and a close monitoring of the quality and content of microarray publications over the past few years has revealed mixed messages being sent by journals. For example, numerous microarray papers have in the past been published, even in high-impact journals, whose data are not supported by corroborative studies. A recent article by Goodman [32] reviewed the contents of 28 microarray papers published in 2002 by Science, Nature, and Cell. Of these 28, only 11 reported the results of confirmatory studies. Nine compared their results to previously published studies, while 10 reported no confirmation studies at all. On other occasions on which 2 or more microarray papers appear in the same or subsequent issues of a journal, one might provide corroborative data while the other does not. To readers and stakeholders there is often no clear reason behind such discrepancies. More often than not, the reason lies in which editor and reviewers appraise the manuscript, as it is apparent that even such highly knowledgeable professionals can have very different opinions on the need for corroborative data.",

(2) Where commonly used model systems are used, such as the effect of a particular hormone on a rodent reproductive organ or a toxicant on a particular cell line, at least a subset of the results has often been corroborated by previously published studies in the same system. (3) In studies in which the focus of the microarray data is not the response of a few novel genes, but rather the overall ''pattern'' of gene expression, there would seem to be limited utility in confirming individual gene expression differences. Take In the rare instances in which published microarray data are not in agreement with data generated by the corroborating method, it is difficult to judge which technique is ''correct.'' However, directly opposing results have rarely been published. Some as yet unpublished studies have found opposing results on different array platforms, but closer investigation revealed that either there was a problem with the probe sequences (they were incorrect) or the magnitude of change between experimental and control samples was so small that even minute variations in the method resulted in a directional change. In addition, in many cases in which a gene appears to have altered expression with one technique, but not the other, sensitivity of the assay may be the main cause.",

For example, it is well established that the dynamic range of microarrays tends to be lower than real-time PCR, thus giving, in essence, ''compressed'' results. Furthermore, this technical variability is apparent not only between the techniques themselves, but also among the methodological variations of each technique. Thus, when analyzing the same biological sample, differences can be expected between qRT-PCR and real-time PCR data and even between data generated by different types of realtime PCR (e.g., SYBR green vs Taqman). The situation is exacerbated with microarrays, of which there are multiple platform choices (e.g., two-color long oligonucleotide-based slide arrays versus single-color Affymetrix short oligonucleotide-based chips versus PCR-product-based radiolabeled membrane arrays). A recent study of cross-platform variability [33] has reported poor correlation between results obtained from spotted cDNA versus synthesized oligonucleotide arrays. However, as the authors point out, the experiments were performed independently by two different laboratories, making it difficult to affix all of the variability to intrinsic properties of the array platforms. It is not just technical differences that give rise to discrepancies. The computational tools and algorithms used to analyze the raw data from each of these techniques also use distinct criteria for extracting expression levels, thus introducing further sources of variation.",

In response to a brief ''letter to the editor'' submitted to raise the profile of this issue [34] , a communication was received from another concerned scientist asking if there were any papers or standards already published that could help them select what genes should be validated by qRT-PCR. Other scientists have openly asked the same and related questions on the gene arrays listserv (gene-arrays@itssrv1.ucsf.edu), an online community dedicated to addressing issues and concerns of microarray users. In fact, two main questions need to be addressed: ''How many genes are enough?'' and ''On what basis should I select the genes to be confirmed?'' In reality, the corroboration of all microarray data is of course impractical because of the large number of genes they contain. Therefore, to avoid the ''thou must confirm'' kiss of rejection or major revision, most authors choose to provide corroborative Northern or RT-PCR data for a small number of genes found on their array. In many cases confirmatory studies have been carried out on only a handful of genes-in some cases as few as one or two [35] . The second issue is which genes to pick. The problem here of course is that the genes selected for corroboration can be cherry-picked to virtually ensure confirmation. For example, genes with a greater than fourfold change in expression on microarrays have consistently been validated by qRT-PCR [36] . So, by picking those genes that show the largest magnitude of change on the microarray, or those that have been confirmed to be changed in previous studies in the same or similar models, a researcher is virtually assured of attaining a passing grade for the corroborative studies section of their own study.",

It must be noted that within the sum of these 30 responses, a number of journals indicated that depending on the type of study, corroboration of array data would be required. Furthermore, several editors noted that even though the need to conduct confirmatory studies was left to the discretion of the reviewers, the threshold for publishing such studies had clearly risen over the past few years as their journals had received more such papers and as the editors and reviewers had become aware of potential problems associated with microarray technology; indeed, two journals acknowledged that a policy of providing corroborative data had become an unwritten rule. A further five editors acknowledged that the requirement and/or guidelines for confirmatory studies was an increasingly thorny issue and one that was a part of ongoing journal editorial board discussions.

Hellmann, unpublished observations). This provides a mechanism for those with limited amounts of total RNA (e.g., <1 Ag) to conduct both microarray and confirmatory qRT-PCR studies. The caveat, however, is that while such amplification systems (e.g., Clontech's SMART system and Ambion's MessageAmp aRNA Kit) may facilitate such an approach, there still remains a degree of skepticism concerning the faithfulness of the final representation of amplified mRNA compared to the original sample. Additionally, this adds yet another step(s) to the overall process and therefore opportunity for the introduction of yet more measurement error. There is justifiable concern that amplification procedures may provide skewed representation of the original RNA population. In fact, these concerns constitute a valid argument for conducting mandatory corroborative studies when amplified samples are used. Many researchers who use microarrays do not necessarily have expertise in designing probes for real-time PCR confirmatory studies. At least one company has seen that this is an underserved market segment just waiting to be exploited. In response to the burgeoning demand for realtime PCR primers, perhaps brought on in part by the need to corroborate microarray data, Applied Biosystems, Inc. (ABI; Foster City, CA, USA), has developed a product line called ''assays-on-demand.'' This is a collection of optimized gene-specific TaqMan reaction sets (primers and probes) for human and mouse genes. These currently consist of over 18,000 and 9000 reaction sets, respectively [41] . Whether intentional or not, it appears that this product line may facilitate the introduction of an element of standardization into the confirmatory studies process, assuming of course that ABI can persuade a high enough number of researchers to use it on a regular basis. Even if competitors develop similar products, as long as the number of companies offering them remains small it will surely serve to reduce the variability that can only ensue when multitudes of researchers design their own custom primer/probe sets.",

As alarming as this might sound to many microarray users for whom this has become the norm, there is in fact justifiable concern that this is not necessarily the best approach. As Chuaqui et al. pointed out [36] , it appears that a subset of target cDNAs will hybridize strongly, not only to their intended probe on the array, but also to other probes that have no discernable sequence homology. Thus, it may be prudent to perform corroborative studies using techniques that are not hybridization-based (which PCR-based methods are). Chuaqui et al. suggest contrasting array-based results in silico with data from sequencing-based expression studies, e.g., serial analysis of gene expression, that do not rely on hybridization methods. Alternatively, Northern blotting enables hybridization specificity to be evaluated also on the basis of transcript size.",

For example, real-time PCR is rapidly becoming the ''gold standard'' for quantifying RNA in samples and is thus often used to corroborate microarray data. However, a gold standard technique usually earns this accolade not necessarily because it provides the most accurate representation of biological reality, but because it is widely used and accepted. In the case of real-time PCR, most researchers would be hard pressed to provide evidence that this technique accurately counts transcripts in a sample. Furthermore, unless and until complete sequence and annotation data of all genes are available, it is impossible to determine whether a particular real-time PCR is amplifying multiple splice forms and/or closely related gene sequences.",

In addition, one may argue that such rulings can alienate some authors who would otherwise have submitted their work to the journal.

Authors also need to know the value of electronic corroboration, a method that may become increasingly acceptable as more papers containing microarray data are published and more public gene expression databases, such as the Chemical Effects in Biological Systems [42] , are populated with data. In many cases, arrays reveal changes in gene expression that have been confirmed one or more times previously in the same model, often with a different technique or microarray platform. If a scientist can identify 10 such genes, is this enough to justify that the array is working ''correctly'' and eliminate the need for confirmatory studies on other genes? While we are inclined to respond in the affirmative, it must be acknowledged that like other techniques, electronic corroboration of microarray data comes with its own set of problems. Whether in the published literature or a database, one can often find multiple studies supporting the changed expression of a particular gene. But clouding rather than clarifying the issue, there may be an equal number of studies that contradict this same finding. This may in part be due simply to biological variation or the fact that many models and methods that on the surface appear the same are in fact subtly different in some way. In addition, it can be difficult to confirm contradictory results. For example, since genes that do not change are not usually reported or discussed as extensively as those that do, it can require intensive review of original methods and data to determine whether the appropriate target for a gene one is trying to corroborate was present on the original array used in a published study and, if so, whether and how that gene's expression changed.",

On the other hand, while the editorial decisions of Circulation Research and Arthritis and Rheumatism not to accept microarray data papers without corroborative data are admirable in the sense that they are an attempt to bring some sort of order to the overgrown microarray field and weed out the ineffectual and incomplete studies, there are clearly circumstances in which it is not essential to conduct such studies to prove that the central message of a paper is correct. We are also concerned that this may set a potentially inappropriate precedent for other journals to follow. Guidelines such as MIAME are appropriate for the reporting of array design, experimental procedures, and other aspects of the mechanics of performing arrays, but such a rigid template is problematic when superimposed on postarray analyses such as the corroborative quantitative studies under discussion.",

This will in part be the result of standardization of microarray methodology and in part be related to the maturation of the technology to a point at which data derived from microarray experiments is as trusted as PCR and DNA sequencing are trusted today. In the meantime, the approach to designing, conducting, reviewing, and publishing studies utilizing microarray data must be one of careful consideration from researchers, editors, and reviewers alike.

In the high-dimensional expression space used in such analyses, a small number of nonsystematic errors in individual hybridizations would be unlikely to cause an artificial movement of points representing different time or dose groups. Indeed these types of ''patterning'' studies constitute a considerable percentage of all ''array'' papers and include identification of specific toxicant signatures, classification of tumor types, etc. Naturally, if such studies ventured into mechanistic discussions based on the behavior of specific genes, then corroborative data would be appropriate. (4) The vast majority of microarray publications have indicated that DNA arrays and Northern blot/RT-PCR analysis normally support each other qualitatively, i.e., the direction of the change is consistent. Of course, the fact that only concordant data are ever seen in the literature may be a bias in that only those that get confirmed get published. (5) Microarrays are still a relatively expensive research tool, and most researchers are reluctant to invest even more time and resources required to conduct RT-PCR or Northern blots. (6) Even today, not all laboratories have easy access to qRT-PCR resources. Though Northern blots may offer an accessible alternative, they require relatively large amounts of RNA, which are oftentimes not available. (7) Regardless of access to a qRT-PCR instrument, some researchers work with such small samples (e.g.,",
