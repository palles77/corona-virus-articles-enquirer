They concluded that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a high rate of admission to intensive care units (13 [32%] of 41 patients) and mortality (six [15%] of 41 patients); however, we believe these conclusions were inaccurate and misleading.",

Case fatality rate is defined as the proportion of people who die of a certain disease; however, mortality rate usually reflects the death rate in an entire population. 2 The case fatality rate is therefore approximately 15% in the study population, 1 but this estimate is also inaccurate since case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases in the early stages. 3 In fact, a large number of mild and asymptomatic patients might not receive timely diagnosis or health care, which can conceal the real incidence and allow disease progression.",

Most patients seem to have mild disease, and about 20% appear to progress to severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, and, in some cases, even death. 4 As of Feb 12, 2020, WHO 4 reports that 45 171 people have been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, and 44 730 of these cases are in China. 4 Of the confirmed cases in China, 8204 (18%) cases were recorded as severe infections, and 1114 (2%) patients died, which is a lower case fatality rate than previously reported. 4, 5 The case fatality rate for COVID-19 reported by Huang and colleagues 1 could be misunderstood, and detection bias should not be neglected.",
