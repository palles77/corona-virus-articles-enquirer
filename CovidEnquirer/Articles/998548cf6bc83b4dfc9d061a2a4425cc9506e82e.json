These are termed ''rapid advice guidelines'' and are the focus of this paper. Rapid advice guidelines must meet minimum standards, the recommendations must be based on evidence and they are subject to an internal quality control and assurance process.

Search strategies for a rapid review will generally have language restrictions because translation is time consuming. The languages of inclusion should be carefully selected based on the guideline topic. For example, a rapid review on personal protective equipment for health workers in Ebola treatment centers [4] , engendered by the Ebola virus disease outbreak that became widespread across parts of West Africa in 2014, included only literature in English and French owing to the geographic distribution of the outbreak and the opinion of experts that most of the relevant literature was in those two languages. Citations in nonselected languages are generally included during the citation screening phase but may be excluded from further analyses if the full text is difficult to access or insufficient time or resources are available for translation.",

In this case, ROBIS [12] , a tool for assessing the risk of bias in systematic reviews (rather than in primary studies) and where appropriate the relevance of a review to the research question at hand, could be applied. Further, to determine a review's quality, A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews [13] could also be used. Although limited in the ability to assess quality in terms of certainty of the effect estimates, this will help to identify areas of potential concern to help judge overall risk of bias and the quality of conduct across included reviews.

These differences, in turn, may affect the credibility of the review and the validity of the review's conclusions. Given that interest in rapid reviews has increased and there is great variability in the approaches and level of reporting [15e19], future research needs to address how rapid reviews compare with standard systematic reviews in terms of bias and credibility, with further guidance developed on when and how to conduct a rapid review. Rapid reviews have become an area of new methodological development for several health research organizations. The US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has established a rapid reviews workgroup [20] . Cochrane, the world's largest producer of high-quality systematic reviews of effectiveness, recently established the Cochrane Methods Rapid Reviews Group [21] . Further, due to the increased interest of public authorities and clinicians, the Guidelines-International-Network established a working group dedicated to the methods for developing guidelines in an accelerated time frame [22] .",

Nevertheless, the core principles and standards for WHO guidelines apply: minimize bias; apply transparent processes and explicit, reproducible methods; acknowledge potential limitations; and attend to the target audience's needs and to the interests of the individuals and populations affected by the recommendations. Applying these principles and meeting these standards in the face of an emergency involves trade-offs, as well as expertise in both guideline development methods and the guideline topic. Further, guideline developers at WHO need to commit to updating these guidelines in a timely manner when new data become available. When warranted, rapid advice guidelines need to be converted to standard ones so that WHO recommendations are robust and the organization is prepared for continuing public health emergencies or for recurrent events.",
