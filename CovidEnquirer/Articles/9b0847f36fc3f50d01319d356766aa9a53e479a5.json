Under explicit consideration of asymptomatic and symptomatic infective individuals for the basi c model without intervention the analysis shows that the dynamics of the epidemic is determined by a basic reproduction number R 0 . A disease-free and an endemic equilibrium exist and are locally asymptotica lly stable when R 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1 respectively. When treatment is included the system has a basic reproduction numbe r, which is the largest of the two reproduction numbers that characterise the drug-sensitiv e (R 1 ) or resistant (R 2 ) strains of the infectious agent. The system has a diseasefree equilibrium, which is stable when both R 1 and R 2 are less than unity. Two endemic equilibria also exist and are associated with treatment and the development of drug resistance. An endemic equilibrium where only the drug-resistant strain persists exists and is stable when R 2 > 1 and R 1 < R 2 . A second endemic equilibrium exists when R 1 > 1 and R 1 > R 2 and both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains are present. The analysis of the system provides insights about the conditions under which the infection will persist and whether sensitive and resistant strains will coexist or not.",

In particular , this becomes a vital task for a newly emergent pathogen (e.g. severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic influenza), due to the absence of a vaccine in the early stages of the outbreak. Policy decisions for public health planning rely on early estimate s of disease parameters, however, unreported subclinical cases lead to difficulties in accu-rately estimating the basic reproduction number of the disease [2] . The resultant uncertainty in epidemiologica l models greatly hinders the decision making process and casts doubt on the effectiveness of proposed interventions. The presence of subclinical infections in a population can significantly influence the outcome of non-pharma ceutical interventions , for example monitoring internati onal borders for symptomatic travellers can be undermined as asymptomatic individua ls are impossible to identify using standard methods [3] . Furthermore, isolating and/or treating clinical cases may be inadequate to protect vulnerabl e populations from the further spread of disease. Prophylaxis of exposed populations can be a useful intervention, in particular, when a vaccine needs time to be developed. However, the possibilit y of drug resistance as a byproduct of the treatment process is an undesirable, but potential, side effect and its epidemiolog ical impact and the likelihoo d of transmission of drug-resistant infectious agents need to be studied closer.",

In the model there are two classes of infected, and thus infectious, individuals; those who develop symptoms after an asymptomatic period and those who remain asymptomatic but infectious and recover without having passed through the symptomatic state. We provide a comparison with an alternative widely-used model which neglects the existence of a preclinical infectious state. We investigate the same features in a modified version of the model, where treatment is applied as an intervention strategy and the resultant developmen t of drug resistance as a side effect is evaluated. Both models are based on a previously developed model for the emergence of drug resistance during influenza epidemics under explicit consideration of asymptomati c cases [7] . We now generalise that model for any persistent infectious disease with infectious asymptomati c cases and in addition we elaborate on the dynamics when treatment is used as interventi on strategy.",

Furthermor e, viral shedding during the preclinical stage of infection was confirmed to occur in approximately 1-8% of infections [22] and preclinical transmis sion was also recorded in early H1N1 outbreaks [23] . Mathema tical models have demonstrated how preclinical transmission can influence the magnitude of outbreaks in large closed populations , such as schools, workplaces and military facilities, and highlight s the importance of such transmis sion in the decision process [24] . In particular, a greater transmis sion ability during the preclinic al period has been associated with children [25] and this increases the need to understa nd the effects of this state on the disease pathway.

For modelling purposes, the proportion of infected individuals developing symptoms is commonly taken as approximately two thirds [4, 5, 29] .

The primary uncertainty surrounds the incubation period and the possibility that it is longer than the latent period resulting in asymptomatic individuals who are infectious [1] . A mean incubation period of 2.05 days was estimated from laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 in the United Kingdom [31] . Viral shedding has been detected on average one day after inoculation with the influenza virus indicating that a latent period of approximately 1 day precedes the onset of infectious ness [30] . Accordingl y, the duration of the preclinical infectious state is approximat ely 1 day and we take d \u00bc 1 day \u00c01 , in agreement with experimental observations [30] . We neglect the latent period in our analysis as it essentially introduces a delay into the system and rarely results in qualitatively different dynamics [13, 15] . Infected individuals are commonly assumed to recover from clinical illness after an average period of 4 days and we set c S \u00bc 0:25 day \u00c01 [4, 32, 33] . This estimate is predominantly derived from studies that estimate the average duration of viral shedding and represents a rather conservati ve estimate. One could also use values derived from estimates of the mean serial interval, which in general have been somewhat lower, approximately 3 days, depending on the viral strain [33] . The duration of infectiousnes s for an asymptomatic case is unknown but previous modelling studies have taken it to be half that of a symptomati c case [34, 35] and we also adopt this assumpti on, taking c A \u00bc 0:5 day \u00c01 . The choice of a 2 day duration for the asymptomati c state yields a probabili ty of progressing to a symptomatic state given by d=\u00f0c a \u00fe d \u00fe l\u00de % 0:67, in agreement with the corresponding probability in Model II of p \u00bc 0:67. With the above choice of paramete rs, the average residence times in the asymptomati c state predicted by the basic model and Model II are approximat ely 2/3 day and 2 days respectively . It should be noted that, although the basic model yields a significantly shorter residence time, all infected individuals pass through this state and are capable of eluding intervention attempts while preclinical and silently spreading the infection within a susceptible population.",

This initial condition corresponds to one symptomatically infected person in a completely susceptible population of size N \u00c0 1. A population of N \u00bc 10 4 is taken in all simulations. The solutions are qualitatively similar, however, Model II yields a higher peak incidence. Significantly, identical transmission rates does not produce quantitative ly identical disease incidence and the partitioning of the population into unique disease states is an important factor in the modelling process. In fact, there will still be differences between the models in the generation time, as well in several other quantities, such as the expected number of cases generated by an asymptotic individual. The delay observed in the basic model is invariably due to the delay introduced by all newly infected individuals being required to first pass through the asymptomati c state prior to symptom onset and the reduced transmission therein. The reverse occurs when the initial infectious seed is asymptomatic. The solution with initial conditions S\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1\u00c0 1=N, I A \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1=N and I S \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0 is plotted in Fig. 5 . Under this scenario, the delay in symptomati c cases is observed to occur in Model II. This can be attributed to the relatively small transmission potential of the asymptomati c cases and the resultant time taken for the infection to gain a foothold in the population. Whereas, some of the initially asymptomatic individua ls in the basic model quickly transition to the symptomatic cases and can start transmitting the infection more efficiently.",

The classic childhoo d diseases also confer permanent immunity on those previously infected and consequently such diseases are largely restricted to the immunolog ically naive child population.

The period of oscillation of the damped oscillations can be approximat ed by 2p=q, where q is the complex part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the endemic equilibria. The approximat e period is plotted as a function of duration of acquired immunity in Fig. 11 . For acquired immunity lasting up to 4 years an intrinsic period of less than 2.5 years is observed for the basic model, which can clearly resonate with an annually forced seasonal transmis sion rate. As immunity becomes permane nt (a ! 0) the system exhibits a period of approximat ely 10.6 years (Fig. 11 insert) indicating that natural birth/death processes alone are not sufficient to produce a period that will resonate with an annual seasonal stimulus .

A major concern with the widespread use of these drugs is the possibility of the emergence of a drug-resis tant strain which is more virulent than the drugsensitive strain. In this section, we consider the effects of treating symptom atically infected individuals with an antiviral drug. Asympto matic individuals are not treated as there is no way of distinguishing them from the susceptible population. However , the preclinic al cases, who proceed to the symptomatic state, can be treated once symptom s develop and they become visible to surveilla nce systems.

Treatment is given to individuals infected with either strain but only to clinical cases. An initially susceptibl e individual can get infected with either strain. However, once infected with the drug-sens itive strain, the treatment process may result in the emergence of the drug-resis tant strain in said individual. As with the basic model, the subscripts A and S refer to asymptomatic and symptomatic individua ls respectively. We further adopt the notation that subscripts r and tr refer to the drug-resistant strain and treated individuals respectively . Thus, we denote the disease compartme nts as follows:",

Similar results have been documented for models of tuberculosis treatment when the latent state is considered [44] [45] [46] in place of an asymptomati c infectious state, which can account for approximately one third of all influenza infections .",

It is possible that health systems would have to reply on these stabl\u00ea P stable * P stable 0 P III II I Fig. 16 . Stability of equilibria in R1 \u00c0 R2 parameter space. P 0 denotes the diseasefree state, b P denotes the presence of only the drug-resistant strain and P \u00c3 denotes the coexistence of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. drugs for several months while a vaccine is developed and, thus, their timely availability in sufficient quantities to meet international requirements would be crucial. Such a demand could only be met if the drugs were stockpiled in advance of a pandemic [47, 48] . If a highly virulent drug-resis tant strain were to emerge the economic impact of losing valuable stockpile s would further devastate already overburdened health systems. Therefore, understanding the dynamics of the emergence of drug resistance is an important topic in the preparation for future pandemic outbreaks. It has been shown that widespread use of antiviral drugs should be avoided during a pandemic, except in the case of high reproduction number, to prevent a more virulent drug-resis tant strain developing [49] . This theory is supported by our findings. The existence and stability of the two strains are complete ly determined by the valu es of the re pr odu cti on numb er s R 1 and R 2 . Th e gre ate r the reproduction number of the drug-sensitive strain the greater the reproduction number required by the drug-resistant strain to become endemic in the population. If the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is close to 1 then a lower value of R 2 can allow the drug-resistant strain to become endemic .",

It was shown that the dynamics of the simple model without intervention are entirely determined by the basic reproduction number R 0 , with the disease becoming endemic when R 0 > 1 and dying out when R 0 < 1. In addition, it was demonstrated that the long-term dynamics are characterised by damped oscillatio ns approaching an endemic state, whose period of oscillation is greatly influenced by the rate at which infection acquired immunity is lost. A comparison was provided between this model and another commonly used model in which the preclinical infectious state is absent. It was shown that, for the general model, two unique transmis sion rates are obtained. For the specific case of influenza the transmission rates are equal, however, the models still predict quantitat ively different disease incidence. By considering a simple public health intervention, where the easily identifiable symptomati c cases are isolated from the general population, it was shown that, under certain conditions, neglecting the preclinical state could underestimate the peak incidence and the resultant burden on public health systems during an epidemic. Better estimate s for the duration of preclinical viral shedding could help to provide more accurate estimates for the impact of pre-symptomatic influenza transmission. We emphasis that the two models considered here cannot be directly compared and we merely present the two approach es and highlight their similarities and differences.",

In addition to the locally stable disease free equilibrium, two other endemic equilibria were identified. The first corresponds to the presence of the resistant strain when R 2 > 1 and, for influenza parameter values, is locally stable when R 2 > R 1 . The second correspond s to the co-circulation of both the drug-sensitive and resistant strains when R 1 > 1 and R 2 < R 1 . Elaborati on of the second endemic equilibrium is mathematically intractable. However, a graphical analysis of the stability properties, in the case of influenza, indicates that it is always locally stable. We note, however, that the effects of back-mu tation from resistant to sensitive strains was neglected. This might possibly occur when the resistant strain carries a cost and is the reason underlying the fact that there is an equilibrium where only the resistant strain is present and no equilibrium with only the sensitive strain.",
