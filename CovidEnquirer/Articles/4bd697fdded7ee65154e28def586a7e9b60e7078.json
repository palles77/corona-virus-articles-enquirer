The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective.

Voluntary quarantine at home is not counted here, because they may still cause infection among family members, through whom the infection can be leaked outside households. Since the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 may significantly increase the awareness among the public, and subsequently change individual behaviors, we also compare the fitted distribution for patients who showed symptom before January 23, and those who showed symptom after January 23. Overall, the period from symptom onset to isolation follows a gamma distribution with a mean 3.7 (95% confidence limits are 3.5-3.9) days and a variance 16.1 (13.8, 18.7), corresponding to a shape parameter 0.85 (0.78, 0.93) and a scale parameter 4.35 (3.92, 4.81) . The period for patients showing symptom before January 23 follows a gamma distribution with a mean 5.2 (4.8, 5.6) days and a variance 18.6 (15. 8, 19.9) , which correspond to a shape parameter 1.46 (1.26, 1.67) and a scale parameter 3.57 (3.15, 3.92).

Even though the earliest quarantine date is January 21, 2020, only 2.5% patients have a negative period (which means that they are quarantined before they showed symptom).

The current recommendation of 14-day quarantine period may be too short, resulting in a 6.7% failure rate. We recommend to increase the quarantine period to 22 days. The periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis changed significantly for patients who showed symptom before and after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, mostly likely driven by behavior change of the general public, and more effective public health control measures after January 23. On average, patients may become infectious 3.9 days before the onset of major symptoms. This, and the 6.6 days delay from symptom onset to diagnosis, severely hinders the effectiveness of contact tracing and quarantine, as evidenced by the 2.5% success rate of quarantine before symptom onset.
