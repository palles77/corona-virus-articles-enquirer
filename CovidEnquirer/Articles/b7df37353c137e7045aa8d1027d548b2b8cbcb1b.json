One of them, Mcab 13, was able to neutralize the virus and to inhibit hemagglutination. Competition binding assays allowed the definition of five epitopes, designated as A, B, C, D, and E, of which epitopes A and B are overlapping. Furthermore, the binding of Mcab 13 (epitope E) could be enhanced by the addition of Mcabs from group B, C, and D. A dot immunoblot assay was used to analyze the effect of denaturation on antibody recognition of the epitopes. Only the binding of Mcab 13 was affected, indicating that the epitope involved in neutralization and hemagglutination is conformation dependent. The epitopes A to D were highly conserved among IBV strains, while epitope E was specific for strains M41 and D3896. In this last strain, however, this epitope was not involved in neutralization.",

To obtain predominantly Mcabs to surface proteins, immunized mice were boosted with intact sucrose-gradient-purified virions by intravenous injection a few days before the fusion. Spleen cells from two hyperimmunized mice were fused in independent experiments. The hybridoma cell lines secreting antiviral Mcabs were screened with the aid of an ELISA. The amount of viral antigen which provided maximum antibody binding and minimum background with polyvalent rabbit anti-M41 sera had been determined previously (0.5 pg sucrose-purified intact virions per well). These conditions were used throughout. Sixteen Mcabs directed against the peplomer protein were selected for further analysis (Table 1) . Their polypeptide specificities had been characterized by immunoprecipitation of lz51-radiolabeled purified virions; typical results are shown in Fig.  1 . No cross-reactivity was detected with allantoic fluid from uninfected eggs, both by ELISA and immunoprecipitation of '251-radiolabeled allantoic fluid.

The definition of epitopes by this assay is based on the assumption that a Mcab binding to a specific site hinders the attachment of another antibody to the same or a proximal site (Stone and Nowinski, 1980) . However, two antibodies directed to the same site will compete in a manner related to their relative avidities and concentrations. In practice, a spectrum of relative interference efficiencies will be obtained (Stone and Nowinski, 1980; Lefrancois and Lyles, 1982a, b .) Two-way competition is significant for the identification of Mcabs recognizing the same epitope, even when the degree of competition is low. Five epitopes (A to E) could be delineated on the peplomer protein, epitopes A and B overlapped. Furthermore there was extensive one-way competition between epitopes C and D and to a lesser extent between epitopes A and C. This does not necessarily indicate overlap of the epitopes, but may also be the result of conformational changes in the peplomeric protein induced by a Mcab against one epitope, leading to a reduced binding of a Mcab to another epitope.",
