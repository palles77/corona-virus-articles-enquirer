We examined \u2022 NO levels by Greiss assay in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of pigs infected with either porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of Nidovirales, like CoV. The antiviral effects of \u2022 NO on these two viruses were tested in an in vitro system using a \u2022 NO donor, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). We detected a large increase in \u2022 NO levels in BAL fluids of PRCV-infected pigs, but not in PRRSV-infected pigs. Pulmonary epithelial cell necrosis induced by PRCV coincided with increased \u2022 NO. Moreover, \u2022 NO levels in cell culture medium of PRRSV-infected alveolar macrophages (AMs) did not differ from that of mockinfected AMs. Antiviral assays showed that \u2022 NO significantly inhibited PRCV replication in swine testicular (ST) cells, whereas PRRSV was not susceptible to \u2022 NO based on the conditions tested. Our study suggests that unlike PRRSV which induces apoptosis in AMs, respiratory CoVs such as PRCV that infect pulmonary epithelial cells and cause cytolysis, induce \u2022 NO production in the respiratory tract. Thus, \u2022 NO may play a role in innate immunity to respiratory CoV infections by inhibiting viral replication.",

Pulmonary epithelial cells are known to contribute to substantial increased levels of \u2022 NO in respiratory viral infections (Xu et al., 2006) , whereas porcine AMs are likely to be less involved in induction of \u2022 NO production in the respiratory tract (Pampusch et al., 1998) . Thus, the elevated BAL NO levels following PRCV infection might originate as a result of viral-induced damage to pulmonary epithelial cells; subsequently, the increased \u2022 NO might also contribute to further damage to the pulmonary epithelial cells. In addition, we speculate that the persisting, increased BAL \u2022 NO levels at PRCV PID 8 and 10 also might be associated with the large numbers of AMs and lymphocytes infiltrating the lungs in parallel with necrosis of respiratory epithelial cells occurring during the same period. However, further studies are needed to identify if iNOS gene expression or if \u2022 NO amounts are increased in AMs and lymphocytes following PRCV infection, although unlike murine macrophages, porcine macrophages stimulated by either IFN-\u2425 or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) did not induce \u2022 NO production (Pampusch et al., 1998) . We suggest that respiratory CoVs such as PRCV that infect pulmonary epithelial cells and cause cytolysis, induce \u2022 NO production in the lungs. Based on the results, SARS-CoV that caused massive necrosis of pulmonary epithelial cells such as type 1 and 2 pneumocytes, similar to that observed in lungs of PRCV-infected pigs (Gu and Korteweg, 2007; Jung et al., 2007) , might also induce \u2022 NO production in the respiratory tract. It is unknown whether SARS-CoV induces \u2022 NO production in the lungs and serum of patients (Akerstrom et al., 2005) . In humans, concentrations of exhaled \u2022 NO are measured in some clinical cases to monitor the progress of pulmonary diseases, such as asthma and viral pneumonia (Xu et al., 2006) . Our study demonstrated that as compared with earlier PIDs, BAL \u2022 NO levels decreased dramatically on PRCV PID 14 by which time PRCV-induced pneumonia had mostly resolved ( Fig. 1A and B) (Jung et al., 2009) . Thus, \u2022 NO levels might be monitored as an indicator of the progression of bronchopneumonia induced by PRCV, or possibly other respiratory CoVs, and to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that increased IFN-\u2425 serum levels followed by elevated \u2022 NO production in lung of the dual-infected pigs might be related to the exacerbated pneumonic lesions. In pigs infected with the influenza H1N2 virus, increased BAL IFN-\u2425 levels at PID 7-10 coincided with increased BAL \u2022 NO levels during the same period, possibly promoting viral clearance from the lungs during the middle and late stages of infection (Jung et al., 2004) . In contrast, our study demonstrated that the trend toward increased Th1 (IFN-\u2425) serum cytokine responses beyond 14 days after PRCV single or PRRSV/PRCV coinfection resulted in the reverse trend of decreased BAL \u2022 NO levels in the PRCV single and PRRSV/PRCV dual-infected pigs. Thus, the induced \u2022 NO levels in BAL of PRCV singly and PRCV/PRRSV dually infected pigs might not be related to the increased Th1 (IFN-\u2425) serum and lung cytokine responses.",

Nevertheless, during the test period, high PRRSV titers in lungs and severe pneu-monia were observed in PRRSV single-infected pigs as reported earlier (Jung et al., 2009) . Our results concur with a prior report showing that \u2022 NO levels in BAL of experimentally PRRSV (strain VR2332)-infected pigs were not increased at PID 2 and 9 (Pampusch et al., 1998) , although the infected pigs had viremia at these PIDs. Our study was expanded to confirm whether PRRSV induces \u2022 NO production in AMs, the major target cells for viral replication. Briefly, AMs-rich BAL cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml) collected from the lungs of a five-day-old gnotobiotic pig were infected with either North American PRRSV VR2332 (10 5 TCID 50 /ml) or MN184 (10 5 TCID 50 /ml).

There were no statistically significant differences in \u2022 NO levels in the cell culture medium between PRRSV-and mock-infected AMs, although large numbers of PRRSV antigen-containing AMs were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining during the test period (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that although PRRSV induces severe apoptotic death of AMs in lungs, it may not induce \u2022 NO in the respiratory tract, and that \u2022 NO might not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of PRRSV.",

The \u2022 NO significantly inhibited PRCV replication in ST cells at PTH 24 (P < 0.05) and 48 (P < 0.01) compared to SNAP-free, virusinfected cells ( Fig. 2A and B) . Similarly, a group 2a CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was also susceptible to the antiviral effects of \u2022 NO, which reduced viral replication in OBL21a cells. However, \u2022 NO production was not a determinant in viral clearance from the lesions (Lane et al., 1997) . Also the group 2b CoV, SARS-CoV was inhibited in Vero E6 cells treated with 400 M SNAP (Akerstrom et al., 2005) ; however, as noted earlier, there is no information about \u2022 NO levels in SARS patients (Akerstrom et al., 2005) . On the other hand, \u2022 NO did not significantly inhibit PRRSV replication in MARC145 cells at PTH 24 and 48 compared to SNAP-free, virus-infected cells ( Fig. 2C and D) . Moreover, treatment with 400 M SNAP in MARC145 cells produced as much \u2022 NO (1.31 and 1.41 mM/ml in MARC145 cells at PTH 24 and 48, respectively) as in ST cells treated with 800 M SNAP ( Fig. 2A and C) . Therefore, our results imply that PRRSV is not susceptible to \u2022 NO under the conditions tested.",
