Bat CoVs exhibit both extensive genetic diversity and a broad geographic range, indicative of a long-standing host association. Despite this, the respective roles of long-term virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission (host-jumping) in the evolution of bat coronaviruses are unclear. Using a phylogenetic approach we provide evidence that CoV diversity in bats is shaped by both species richness and their geographical distribution, and that CoVs exhibit clustering at the level of bat genera, with these genus-specific clusters largely associated with distinct CoV species. Co-phylogenetic analyses revealed that cross-species transmission has been more common than codivergence across coronavirus evolution as a whole, and that cross-species transmission events were more likely between sympatric bat hosts. Notably, however, an analysis of the CoV RNA polymerase phylogeny suggested that many such host-jumps likely resulted in short-term spill-over infections, with little evidence for sustained onward transmission in new co-roosting host species.",

In turn, the notion that these viral diseases likely have their ultimate ancestry in bats triggered a major increase in the sampling of bat viruses, leading to the progressive uncovering of a diverse bat virome and further fueling the idea that these animals are major reservoirs of emerging pathogens (Moratelli and Calisher, 2015; Young and Olival, 2016) .",

Although RNA viruses commonly jump species boundaries, in part reflecting their ability to rapidly generate important adaptive variation (Geoghegan et al., 2017; Holmes, 2009; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005) , coronaviruses (CoVs) seem to exhibit a strong zoonotic potential and demonstrated by the emergence SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in humans in 2002 and 2012, respectively (Graham et al., 2013) . Coronaviruses are single-strand RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales that are classified in four genera: Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma and Deltacoronavirus. Among these, gamma and delta CoVs are largely associated with avian hosts, while alpha and beta CoVs include several pathogens of humans and domestic animals, and whose emergence is likely associated with crossspecies transmission events (Drexler et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and are associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection characterized by mortality rates of 10% and 35%, respectively (Hu et al., 2015) . The SARS pandemic was promptly controlled through an unprecedented global containment effort and the virus has not been reported in humans since May 2004 (Graham et al., 2013) . Despite this rapid eradication, SARS-CoV caused almost 800 deaths in 27 countries, with sustained outbreaks in 18 countries on three continents (WHO). There is increasing evidence that rhinolophid bats act as natural reservoirs for SARS-related CoVs, with direct spill-over to non-flying mammals. For example, like the SARS coronavirus, some bat CoVs are able to utilize the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor (Ge et al., 2014; Menachery et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2016) . Conversely, the role of bats in the epidemiology of MERS-CoV is less well understood as the human viruses are clearly mostly related to those viruses found in dromedary camels (Sabir et al., 2016) . Indeed, although related viruses have been found in bats, these are divergent in their spike sequences and seem to be inefficient in the use of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as cell a receptor (Anthony et al., 2017a; Reusken et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2014) . The MERS epidemic is ongoing in the Middle East and travel-associated cases have been reported in 27 countries worldwide (WHO, 2017) . Finally, Alphacoronavirus 229E and NL63, which cause a mild influenza-like syndrome in humans, share a common ancestor with viruses sampled from the bat genus Hipposideros and Triaenops, respectively (Corman et al., 2015 (Corman et al., , 2016 Tao et al., 2017) .",

In addition, bat CoVs are phylogenetically interspersed with those associated with other mammals, including humans and domestic species, compatible with the idea that bats are an important genetic reservoir (Tao et al., 2017; Woo et al., 2012) . The long-term evolutionary interactions between bats and coronaviruses is also supported by phylogenetic evidence that CoVs exhibit some species-and genus-specific tropism (Cui et al., 2007; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007) , and that phylogenetically related viruses are found in related bat species independent of sampling location. In contrast, that CoVs are not always shared among bat species that co-roost suggests that there are some barriers to cross-species transmission (Anthony et al., 2013; Corman et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2007; Drexler et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2006) .",

However, recent studies on specific bat taxa from particular locations suggests that the role of virus-host codivergence in the evolutionary history of CoVs may have been overestimated relative to other events including host-jumping (Anthony et al., 2017b; Lin et al., 2017; Tao et al., 2017) . Indeed, as well as strict virus-host co-divergence, topological congruence could also arise from preferential host switching, in which viruses most often successfully jump from closely related hosts (De Vienne et al., 2013) . The analysis of the long-term evolutionary history of bat CoVs is also complicated by frequent multiple substitution at deep evolutionary distances that prevents the accurate estimation of divergence times (Wertheim et al., 2013) .",

Accordingly, we assigned event costs = 1 for virus lineage duplication, host shift, and virus loss, or failure to diverge following host speciation, and costs of both 0 and 1 for co-divergence. Jane was run for 45 generations (G) with a set size of 23 (S). This analysis used the tree topologies based on RdRp and cytb for coronaviruses and their hosts, respectively. In addition, the congruence between the phylogeny of bat genera and their CoV clusters was depicted graphically using the tanglegram function of the DECIPHER package (Wright, 2016) from the R environment. To exclude the impact of possible host misclassification, this analysis was also run for datasets_2 in which hosts are assigned genetically.",

The taxonomy of all other clusters was not resolved due to short fragment lengths. In all but two cases, the pairwise amino acid distance between sequences > 816 bp was consistent with the association between RdRp genus-specific clusters identified in this study and distinct RGUs. The exceptions, C18\u03b1 and C20\u03b1, both associated with Myotis bats, and C43\u03b2 and C44\u03b2, associated with Pipistrellus and Eptesicus, respectively, shared 96% similarity at the amino acid level in 816 bp of RdRp and hence should be classified as a single RGU (Table 3) . Mean nucleotide divergence between sequences from Eptesicus and Pipistrellus was 39.3% (SE = 0.11), compared to only 1.6% (SE = 0.005) mean divergence within sequences from Pipistrellus bats only. Interestingly, our analyses identified these RdRp genus-specific clusters as belonging to the same putative species of MERS-CoV, with amino acid identities of 98.2% and 96.3%, respectively (Table 3) .",

For example, across the CoVs as a whole, there were 0-11 co-divergence events compared to 38-47 host-shift events. Importantly, this result was independent of the cost associated with co-divergence (assigned as either equal or lower than that associated with cross-species transmission) and was the same when the alpha and beta CoVs were analyzed independently, such that there was no difference in the frequency of cross-species transmission between these viral groups.

In only two cases did cross-species transmission involve related hosts from different geographical areas, namely phyllostomidae bats of the genera Carollia and Artibeus sampled in Costa Rica and Panama, respectively, and bats of the genera Miniopterus and Eptesicus from China and USA, both belonging to the superfamily Vespertilionoidea. Unfortunately, the host classification was not confirmed genetically for any of these events so that more accurate analyses could not be performed.

Our data indicate that bats are indeed associated with several distinct clusters of alpha and beta CoVs, and that most CoVs from non-flying mammals also fell within these clusters on phylogenetic trees. However, we also noted the existence of monophyletic groups of CoVs associated with mammalian species other than bats, such as Alphacoronavirus 1 and Betacoronavirus 1. Interestingly, we revealed a positive association between CoV diversity and the species richness and geographical Table 4 Frequency of different evolutionary scenarios following co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis (Jane) of the full set of sequences. Results are shown assuming equal or lower costs for codivergence compared to the other possible evolutionary events.

Furthermore, we detected a strong impact of sampling effort on CoV diversity, suggesting that this still likely underestimated in bats as a whole (Anthony et al., 2017b) . Our data also provide evidence for the close phylogenetic relationship of coronaviruses from hosts of the same genus, with distinct putative CoV species tending to be associated with different bat genera. Indeed, single RGUs (which are considered indicative of distinctive CoV species) were associated with more than one bat species, particularly in those bats that live sympatrically or that belong to the same genus. Similarly, despite the evidence for geographical structuring, CoVs belonging to the same RGUs were also described in different locations, as previously described (Leopardi et al., 2016) . Hence, as a general rule, CoVs exhibit genus-specificity rather than species-specificity. Conversely, CoV clusters associated with bat genera Pipistrellus and Eptesicus showed low divergence at the amino acid level based on the 816 bp fragment, suggesting their classification within the same CoV putative species. Interestingly, these clusters were also highly similar to MERS-CoV, such that they may be included within a single CoV species, although more data are needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

This hypothesis is supported by our finding of discordant topologies between trees estimated using the RdRp and the spike protein for CoVs detected in Rousettus and Miniopterus bats and thereby supporting previous results (Huang et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015) . In this context, it is noteworthy that bats from the genera Pipistrellus, Rhinolophus and Hipposideros are also those that show the highest identity with three human coronaviruses, namely MERS CoV, SARS CoV and hCoV 229E, respectively.",

This hypothesis is consistent with the finding of highly related CoVs in different species nonflying mammals; for example, feline coronavirus (FCoV) and canine coronavirus (CCoV) define two sister clades within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species, and are likely a result of recent interspecies jumping (Woo et al., 2009) .",

This involved two distinct clusters of CoVs from closely related Vespertilionid bats from the genera Pipistrellus and Eptesicus, likely associated with the same CoV species. The availability of spike sequences also allowed us to identify a clear diversification of CoVs in bats of the genus Rousettus following their jump from a donor cluster associated with the co-roosting bat genus Hipposideros. Conversely, however, our data suggest that cross-species transmissions between distantly related hosts often result in transient spill-over infections, reflected as an absence of daughter lineages in phylogenetic trees (although this may also reflect a lack of appropriate sampling).",

Of particular note is the short length of most fragments of coronaviruses used for analyses, with less than half compressing the 816 bp necessary for RGU classification (Drexler et al., 2010) , and which obviously limit phylogenetic resolution. Similarly, the uncertain classification of certain host species should not be underestimated, due to variable species assignments as well as the cryptic nature of several bat species that cannot be readily identified based on obvious morphological features but whose correct assignation often require the use of genetic or echolocation studies (Kingston et al., 2001) (Table S1 ). Indeed, the hosts included in our database represent only about 20% of the bat species (6% of the bat genera) described worldwide. Studies of CoV diversity have mainly been performed in China and Europe, while important hot spots for bat biodiversity (Richardson, 2002) , such as South East Asia and Latin America, are under-represented. Furthermore, sequences collected from different areas are generally weakly representative for their specific continent with, for example, most African samples being collected from Ghana and Kenya (Fig. 1) . While the reliability of our conclusions was confirmed by analyses performed on a much smaller data set with more accurate host assignments, we encourage a more comprehensive sampling, the collection of longer CoV sequences, and the accurate genetic attribution of the host species, all of which provide the information needed to better reveal the evolution and ecology of coronaviruses in bats.",
