Considering its airborne transmission, early diagnosis of such disease is particularly important. This study explored respiratory viral infections with influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, coronavirus, and other early diagnostic substances as confirmed by literature resources. This study also used the corresponding monoclonal antibodies that were produced with the use of hybridoma technology, which were fixed on the chip after purification, for further serum detection. Using this method, a new technique to simultaneously detect 6 kinds of febrile respiratory viruses in a protein chip was developed. The accuracy rate of this method can be >99.65%. This product is inexpensive and capable of high-precision and high-throughput screening, which are prominent advantages.",

The clinical importance of some of these newly discovered viruses is currently under investigation [17, 18] .

However, given the high cost of testing, complex operation, long cycle, high requirements of equipment and operators, and other factors, this technology has significantly limited applications in rapid diagnosis of respiratory viral infections, particularly early diagnosis, which has a decisive role in developing rapid and accurate treatment programs. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) have been recognized to play an important role in diagnosing respiratory virus infection since the mid-1990s, but it was the emergence of CoV in 2003 that showcased the importance of these tests for diagnosing respiratory virus infection [22, 23] .

Additionally post-translational modifications, which are often critical for determining protein function, are not visible on DNA microarrays.

Protein chip is a high-throughput method used to track the interactions and activities of proteins and to determine their function, including on a large scale [34] . Its main advantage lies in the fact that large numbers of proteins can be tracked in parallel. The chip consists of a support surface, such as a glass slide, nitrocellulose membrane, bead, or microtiter plate, to which an array of capture proteins is bound [35] . Probe molecules, typically labeled with a fluorescent dye, are added to the array. Any reaction between the probe and the immobilized protein emits a fluorescent signal that is read by a laser scanner [36] . Protein microarrays are rapid, automated, economical, and highly sensitive, consuming small quantities of samples and reagents [37] . The concept and methodology of protein microarrays was first introduced and illustrated in antibody microarrays (also referred to as antibody matrix) in 1983 in a scientific publication and a series of patents [38] . The high-throughput technology behind the protein microarray was relatively easy to develop, because it was based on the technology developed for DNA microarrays, which have become the most widely used microarrays [39] .",

Therefore a number of label-free detection methods are available, such as surface plasmon resonance, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanowire sensors (where detection occurs via changes in conductance), and microelectromechanical system cantilevers [41, 42] .

The results showed that the specificity of selected antibodies for early markers are extremely strong, and the positive rate is w100%, in which PIV, RSV, and BoV had 1 undetected case, probably because of experimental operation and other operator factors.
