            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV), a re-emerging virus, constitutes the largest vector-borne disease virus, with 50-100 million cases reported every year. Although DENV infection induces lifelong immunity against viruses of the same serotypes, the subsequent infection with the heterologous serotypes can cause more severe form of the disease, such as Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). However, there is neither approved vaccine nor specific drugs available to treat this disease. In this study, previously developed 19 human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) showing strong to moderate cross neutralizing activity were selected. Most of them (13/19) were targeted to domain II of envelop glycoprotein. To understand and clarify the recognition properties, the maturation mechanisms comprising Variable/Diversity/Joining (VDJ) recombination, Variable Heavy (VH)/Variable Light (VL) chain pairing, variability at junctional site, and somatic hypermutation (SHM) of those antibodies were studied and compared with their predecessor germline sequences. IMGT/V-QUEST database was applied to analyze the isolated VH and VL sequences. To confirm the correction of isolated VH/VL, 3 HuMAbs (1A10H7, 1B3B9, 1G7C2) was transiently expressed in HEK293T cell. All three clones of the expressed recombinant IgG (rIgG) showed the same binding and neutralizing activity as same as those from hybridomas. The data obtained in this study will elucidate the properties of those HuMAbs for further genetic modification, and its binding epitopes.",

            "text": "Aedes mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas. It is a member of the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It is the enveloped icosahedral, positive-stranded RNA viruses. The approximately 11kb genome is translated as a single polyprotein, which is cleaved into three structural proteins (capsid [C] , premembrane/membrane [prM/M], and envelop [E]), and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) by host and viral protease [1] . They comprise four distinct serotypes, DENV1 through DENV4. This virus is the major cause of morbidity in trop-ical and subtropical regions, and have been estimated that there are 50-100 millions of infected cases annually around the world. However, nowadays, there is neither proven vaccine nor specific anti-viral drug to all serotypes available. Infection with DENV can cause a spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from flu-like illness, dengue fever (DF), to a severe fatal disease known as DHF or DSS. These fatal forms are often attributed to re-infection by heterologous serotypes [2] . Primary infection with any of the four serotypes can produce lifelong immunity to that serotype, but only temporary immunity to the others; moreover, the sequential infections in the presence of heterologous dengue antibodies often lead to a more severe secondary infection of DHF/DSS [3] . These is attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) when non-neutralizing antibodies form a complex with the virus and infect phagocytes via Fc receptors, causing more viral load and enhance infection involving DHF/DSS [3] . http Passive antibody therapies, based on targeted-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAb) have been widely studied in several infectious diseases including viral diseases, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), rabies, vaccinia, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and West Nile virus (WNV), which some of them have been approved to use both in prophylaxis or treatment in the US market [4] . However, therapeutic antibodies to treat dengue virus are still limited.",

            "text": "Other than epitope mapping studies for vaccine design, the genetic analysis of variable region sequences of anti-viral Abs have recently shown its potential for vaccine development. This germline characterization has recently been widely studied in several anti-viral MAb including HIV-1 virus [13] [14] , Influenza virus [15] , and SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, and Nipah virus [16] using phage display and high-throughput sequencing. One study of anti-influenza antibodies have shown that mutation at only 7 amino acids in the Heavy chain Complementary Determining Region 2 (HCDR2) and Framework Region 3 (FR3) are evolved for the full activity of neutralization, which can be applied for the rational design of epitope-specific vaccine inducing broadly-neutralizing antibody [15] . For anti-DENV MAbs characterization, there is one study characterizing mouse MAb 4E11 that targeted to EDIII which has been raised against serotype 1 dengue virus, but can neutralize all 4 serotypes with different efficacy. It was found that mutation at only some hotspot can greatly affect the binding activity of that MAb [17] . However, germline study of anti-DENV HuM-Abs is still limited. For this reason, further characterization of genetic sequences of our 19 hybridoma IgGs -all targeted to E, mostly targeted to EDII and show strong to moderate neutralizing activity -is needed. These should be a good model of antibody's genetic study that will enlighten dengue vaccine development through the induction of cross-neutralizing activity.",

IGHV1-69 (5/19) and IGHV3-23 (5/19) are the major germline HC whereas IGLV7-43 is the major germline LC (Fig. 1A and B) . As IGHV1-69 was the highest HC germline used in our anti-DENV HuMAbs, interestingly, the highest percentage of IGHV1-69 HC germline was also previously reported from other anti-viral MAbs, such as influenza virus [14, 19] , HIV, SARS CoV, Hendra, and Nipah virus [16] . It was found that germline gene usages of both HC and LC were different among two libraries. HV1-46, HC3-33, and HV5-51 were most frequently found from library constructed from 40 days post infection PBMCs. In contrast, HV1-69 (26%) was the most frequently used HC germline from library constructed from 8 months PBMCs. Comparing with our study, that all 19 IgGs were generated from acute patient PBMCs from secondary dengue infection, it can be suggested that after primary infection, this IGHV1-69, which is the high frequency heavy chain germline presence in IgM repertoires [16] , should be the major group of germline heavy chain responsible for antibody production. After recovery, the human immune response can stay long in the human blood circulation. Once re-infection has occurred, the memory B cells were stimulated; therefore, high possibility of antibody production from this kind of germline heavy chain was observed.",
