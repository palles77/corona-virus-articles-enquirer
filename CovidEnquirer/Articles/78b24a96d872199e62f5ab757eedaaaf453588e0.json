            "text": "Emerging diseases and/or pathogens is a term used frequently when describing new or spreading infections in the human population. It is a term used to describe the emergence of previously unrecognized pathogens that produce human disease or recognized pathogens expanding in different ways through the population. 1 Emerging diseases have historically been responsible for civilizationaltering events. Bubonic plague during the 14th century was responsible for the death of 60% of the European population. 2 The Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 resulted in the death of 50 to 100 million worldwide; the rinderpest epidemic in livestock in Eastern Africa during the 19th century resulted in the starvation of 75% of the Massai population; and potato blight produced the Irish potato famine, reducing the Irish population by 25%. 3 Our generation has had dramatic experiences in the last decade with emerging or reemerging pathogens that rapidly spread and result in death or illness in large segments of the population, to include many of the pathogens mentioned in this section and outlined in this book, such as Ebola and Zika viruses. For the clinician, the challenge is to distinguish a viral febrile illness caused by an endemic pathogen from one that is \"emerging\" and has the potential for human-to-human spread, requiring isolation and, if available, targeted therapy. The scenario is common: a patient presents to the emergency room, usually on a weekend, with fever and a constellation of symptoms and a recent history of travel overseas. The fear is this Ebola, Lassa fever, or another unknown contagious pathogen, and are the clinician and the staff at risk? In this section the epidemiology, clinical features, and evaluation of the patient with a potential viral febrile illness from an emerging pathogen are discussed.",

            "text": "Emerging viral pathogens can, in general, present in one of the following clinical categories: (1) generalized febrile illness producing a \"viral syndrome,\" (2) fever with meningitis/encephalitis, (3) fever with joint pain, (4) hemorrhagic fever, and (5) birth defects. Due to human host and viral diversity, many viruses can produce illness across the spectrum of these clinical categories. For example, dengue virus as a first infection can result in a sub-clinical infection or a febrile illness that results in a self-limited fever, myalgia, bone pain, and transient laboratory abnormalities. On second infection, dengue virus in a minority of patients can produce a severe hemorrhagic disease. Chikungunya and Ross River viruses can produce a generalized febrile illness but also severe joint pains that can persist for months. Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and the equine encephalitis viruses are classic viruses that produce a meningo-encephalitis in 1% of the persons infected. Yellow fever and the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) are examples of severe hemorrhagic fever viruses. The recent Zika virus outbreak and birth defects associated with infection in pregnant women have broadened our clinical categories to include those that produce birth defects. All viruses produce a constellation of signs and symptoms early in infection that are clinically the same. After infection, an incubation period of normally between 1 and 14 days can occur, with some exceptions. For example, Ebola has been reported to occur 21 days after exposure. 9 The first onset of symptoms heralds the host immune response with fever followed by generalized symptoms of headache, muscle aches, joint pains, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Early laboratory abnormalities that would indicate a viral infection include leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Electrolyte and renal function abnormalities can be common if the patient is volume depleted. As the disease progresses, clinical manifestations will be become more specific for the clinical syndrome and provide clues on the potential virus, such as the onset of headache, neck stiffness, and altered sensorium in the case of encephalitis; severe joint pains; or bleeding internally or externally with blood loss or hemoconcentration, with plasma leakage with the hemorrhagic fevers. Specific manifestations such as diuresis, volume loss, and renal dysfunction can be an indicator for viruses that produce hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome such as the Hantaviruses or Lassa fever. Rash is common to all the viral illnesses and in general indicates a shift in the host immune response from a cell-mediated to a humoral immune response with a rise in antibodies. It is important for the clinician to understand that viremia occurs several days before the onset of clinical illness and through the duration of early clinical symptoms. Pathogens that are spread by insect vectors, the respiratory route, blood-borne contact, or sexually can occur before the onset of clinical symptoms, and thus infect others who come in contact by that route. Contact tracing from the index patient should include the days of viremia before the onset of symptoms.",

            "text": "Understanding the incubation time of viral pathogens is the first important step in evaluating the febrile patient. A travel history in an area of an outbreak or potential hot spot for an emerging disease should be within the incubation period of these pathogens (1-21 days) . For example, a febrile patient in your clinic or emergency room who had traveled overseas 3 months before fever would be unlikely to have a viral infection, and potential other etiologies such as non-falciparum malaria or a parasitic infection should be considered. An extensive travel history and exposures while traveling will help to determine the risk for the patient to acquire a local infection. An important question often not asked is \"who else is sick in your travel party, and have you been in contact with anyone acutely ill?\" This can often be an important clue on the risk of acquiring an infection. If the patient is within the incubation period and at risk for a viral illness, determining the clinical illness day is important when obtaining the history. Our studies in hospitalized patients with dengue infection, for example, illustrate the importance for the clinician to approach the viral febrile illness and differential of potential viruses by determining the patient's clinical illness day and their clinical manifestation. 10 Fig. 36 .1 demonstrates an idealized patient with a viral febrile illness. In this example, after an incubation period of 3 days, the first day of viremia occurs. Viremia will continue, with the onset of fever heralding the first day of clinical illness. In general, the first 3 to 5 days of clinical illness of most viral infections will be a generalized febrile illness with no clinical signs or symptoms that will distinguish the illness to a specific viral pathogen, denoted here as a viral syndrome. Headache, myalgia, nausea, diarrhea, and respiratory symptoms will be common during the viral syndrome stage. Influenza, dengue, chikungunya, Ebola, or Lassa fever will all be indistinguishable from each other in the early clinical illness. By day 5 of the clinical illness day, day 9 post-infection, the manifestations will become more specific and hemorrhagic manifestations and coagulopathy will occur, along with plasma leakage and encephalitis. As the host response increases with antibody levels rising and cytokines peaking, the manifestations of a specific viral illness will become apparent as cellular damage occurs.",

In this example, viremia will start before fever and last until 6 days of clinical illness and before the onset of viral-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. During viremia, diagnostic tests should be focused on detecting the virus, whether by viral isolation, molecular techniques, or antigen detection. Viremia starts to resolve with the onset of the host response and corresponding rise in viral-specific IgM and IgG. Antibodies will continue to rise during the convalescent period, and IgG will last several years or more. Once antibodies start to rise, the diagnostics are focused on their detection, with a variety of methods that can be used, including enzyme-linked immunoassays, hemagglutination inhibition, plaque reduction neutralization, and rapid tests.",

            "text": "The human dengue cycle is maintained by DENV transmission back and forth between mosquito vectors and viremic individuals. After the bite of a DENV-infected mosquito, there is local viral replication in Langerhans cells and cutaneous dendritic cells and spread to regional lymph nodes. Thereafter, the virus rapidly disseminates, leading to viremia. The likely DENV factories are tissue macrophages, dendritic cells, and adipocytes. The incubation period between a mosquito bite and symptom onset is 3 to 10 days. Viremia generally lasts for 4 to 5 days, and the disappearance of viremia correlates with fever resolution. 5, 7 The most severe and sometimes fatal form of dengue is dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (severe dengue). The distinguishing characteristic of DHF/DSS is a transient and rapid increase in vascular permeability. The plasma leakage syndrome is most often characterized by hemoconcentration and transudate accumulation across serosal surfaces (i.e., pleural effusions and ascites). In its extreme form (DSS), hypovolemic shock ensues. 8, 9 The plasma leakage syndrome of DHF/DSS develops rapidly at the time of defervescence and clearance of viremia, and is transient (hours to days). Primary infection with a DENV serotype produces long-term protective immunity against re-infection with the homologous serotype (homotypic immunity), but only short-term protective immunity against heterologous serotypes (heterotypic immunity). 10, 11 The relative risk of developing DHF/DSS (severe dengue) is increased 15-to 100-fold with sequential heterologous DENV infections (secondary DENV infection) compared with primary DENV infections. 3 Most individuals with secondary DENV infections do not develop severe dengue. Primary DENV infections in infants <12 months old also appear more likely to lead to DHF/DSS (severe dengue) than primary DENV infections in children or adults. 12 Countries or areas at risk of dengue transmission Distribution of countries or areas at risk of dengue transmission, worldwide, 2008 Numerous risk factors have been identified for the development of severe dengue. They can be divided into three general steps, and multiple risk factor combinations can take place to produce the three steps. The first step includes factors that can increase the dengue viral load. These include antibody-dependent enhancement of viral infection, 3 impairment of CD8+ T-cell and natural  killer cell anti-viral immune responses, 13 adiposity, 14 virus genetics/ serotype differences, and host genetics. The second step includes factors that can promote anti-DENV pro-inflammatory immune responses. These include cross-reactive anti-DENV T-cell responses, 15 anti-DENV IgG/DENV immune complexes, adiposity, 14 and host genetics. The final step includes factors that tip the balance in favor of permeability-inducing conditions in the serosal cavities. Several pro-inflammatory cytokines/mediators can promote endothelial paracellular permeability, and virus-induced type I interferon signaling can augment the endothelial barrier function. Each of the three steps described here is necessary, but not sufficient by itself, to produce severe dengue.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for DHF/DSS incorporates three additional clinical criteria beyond DF and has established a grading scale of I to IV for DHF severity (Table 36. 1.1). 16 Despite the moniker \"hemorrhagic fever,\" most often the hemorrhagic manifestations may only be a positive tourniquet test or spontaneous skin or mucosal petechiae. Severe coagulopathy is nearly always seen in the context of profound shock and multi-organ failure. Recent WHO guidelines have moved away from the DHF case definition and, instead, proposed a new case definition termed severe dengue (see Table  36 .1.1). 18 Whether defined as DHF/DSS or severe dengue, the majority of serious morbidity and mortality caused by DENV infections is due to a vascular leakage syndrome with hypotension and shock. Clinically significant hemorrhage can sometimes occur in the absence of vascular leakage, particularly in adults. Other uncommon complications of DENV infections include hepatic necrosis, encephalopathy/encephalitis, and chorioretinitis. Unlike Zika virus infection, DENV infection during pregnancy has not been associated with congenital malformations.",

The initial clinical findings in DENV infections are fairly non-specific and can be difficult to distinguish from other common febrile illnesses in the tropics. The differential diagnosis for dengue-like illnesses includes typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, or malaria. In the appropriate clinical setting, measles, influenza, chikungunya, or Zika virus infections are also possibilities. Early in the febrile course, the suspicion for a DENV infection can be heightened by the presence of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, mild aspartate aminotransferase elevation, and a positive tourniquet test or spontaneous petechiae. The positive predictive value for combinations of these early clinical findings has generally been good when dengue is highly prevalent (i.e., during the rainy season). 17, 19 The critical phase of any DENV infection is the 24 to 48 hours surrounding defervescence-generally around days 5 to 7 of the febrile illness in a secondary DENV infection. This is the time period when plasma leakage will take place in patients developing DHF/DSS. A challenge in patients with dengue, or suspected dengue, is to identify those at risk for severe disease before the critical phase is reached. A group of warning signs and symptoms have been identified in DENV-infected patients that often presage the deterioration to DHF/DSS (severe dengue) (see Table 36 .1.1). 18 These patients require close monitoring and supportive care during the critical phase of illness.",

However, DENV RT-PCR is not routinely available in most clinical settings. Viremia can also be detected by antigen-detection assays that measure circulating levels of a DENV non-structural protein, NS1. The timeline for detectable circulating soluble NS1 lags viral RNA RT-PCR detection by 1 to 2 days. The most widely used serologic assay for dengue is IgM/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A single positive dengue IgM or high-titer IgG can only provide a presumptive diagnosis of dengue. Definitive serologic diagnosis requires paired acute and convalescent sera. Anti-DENV IgM antibody levels do not generally become positive until the fifth or sixth day of illness and can be affected by other flavivirus infections (e.g., Japanese encephalitis virus, Zika virus). Therefore the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of anti-DENV IgM ELISA assays often depend on the timing of the blood sample, co-circulating flaviviruses in the region, and the manufacturer.",

Supportive care with rest is Current or previous local transmission of chikungunya virus indicated during the acute joint symptoms. Movement and mild exercise may decrease stiffness and arthralgia, but heavy exercise may exacerbate rheumatic symptoms. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for chronic pain. A number of therapeutic options are in development, as are several vaccine candidates. 18 Because no vaccine or specific medication is yet available against CHIKV infection, vector control is very important in controlling or preventing transmission. Elimination of breeding sites or source reduction is an important control approach. A. aegypti is typically a container-habitat species (Fig. 36.2.4 ) and breeds primarily in artificial containers and receptacles. Therefore all water tanks, cisterns, barrels, trash containers, etc., need to be covered tightly with a lid. Old tires, tin cans, buckets, drums, bottles, etc., should be removed, as mosquitoes may breed in these containers if they accumulate water. In ornamental garden water tanks, larvivorous fish (e.g., gambusia, guppy) can be introduced. In case water containers cannot be emptied on a daily or weekly basis, larvicidal treatments can be applied. 19 Both primary vectors, A. aegypti and A. albopictus, are principally daytime biters. Insect repellant containing N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) or another registered active ingredient should be applied on exposed skin (Table 36. 2.1). People should be advised to wear long sleeves and pants and have secure screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. Insecticide-treated bed net use during daytime resting can help prevent mosquito bites. Infected persons should be protected from further mosquito exposure (staying indoors and/or under a mosquito net during the first few days of illness) so that they cannot contribute to the transmission cycle.

Maternal infection disrupts fetal central nervous system development and causes intrauterine growth retardation and fetal loss. Infection is associated with cortical malformations and intra-cranial calcifications. The congenital malformations include ventriculomegaly, dystrophic calcifications, severe cortical neuronal depletion, decreased brain weight, congenital contractures, marked early hypertonia with symptoms of extrapyramidal involvement, and ocular and hearing problems. 15 Pathologists also identified pulmonary hypoplasia and pathologic changes consistent with viral infection of multiple organs, including liver and kidneys. 17 Ongoing follow-up will reveal the extent of other developmental problems. Based on data from the U.S. territories (2464 live-born infants from completed pregnancies with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection), about 5% had Zika-associated birth defects.

RNA appears to be detectable longer in whole blood and urine samples compared with serum samples. These molecular tests can be performed on serum, whole blood, or urine up to 2 weeks after symptom onset; in pregnant women, NATs may be performed up to 12 weeks after symptom onset or exposure 28, 29 (see Fig. 36.3.2) . Detection of Zika IgM by IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) followed by confirmation with plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) can also establish the diagnosis. Zika IgM may be reactive when performed 2 to 12 weeks after exposure, but can persist longer. Unfortunately, Zika serology cross-reacts with other flaviviruses, and PRNT, which is needed to differentiate among the flaviviruses, is labor intensive, time consuming, and challenging to interpret. Unlike dengue and chikungunya, where IgG is available to assess past infection and immunity, Zika IgG is not available in the United States.",

After the end of the initial epidemic in 1962, no clinical cases were recognized until a subsequent epidemic occurred in Uganda in 1996 to 1997 resulting in several hundred cases. However, sporadic cases have been reported from several regions in sub-Saharan Africa outside of recognized epidemics. [2] [3] [4] Furthermore, a recent serosurvey from coastal Kenya demonstrated 13% prevalence of ONNV antibody presence despite no reported recent outbreaks in the region. 5 An illness with clinical features very similar to ONN has been described in Nigeria with the causative agent originally named Igbo Ora virus. Subsequent studies have shown that Igbo Ora is actually a strain of ONNV. 3 The genetic similarities of Igbo Ora and the 1996 to 1997 ONNV to the 1959 ONNV, together with serosurveys from Kenya, Cameroon, and West Africa, suggest at least some level of unrecognized endemic transmission occurs during interepidemic periods.",

The virus was first isolated from Aedes vigilax mosquitoes trapped beside the Ross River in Queensland (Fig. 36.5.1 ) in 1959. 1 After a series of outbreaks, the disease was originally called epidemic polyarthritis. 2 EPIDEMIOLOGY RRV disease is notifiable to public health authorities in Australia and is the most common arboviral disease in Australia. There has been a mean of 4600 (range 1451-9554) reported cases per year (2000-2015) , equating to a mean national incidence of 21.3 (range 7.4-40.2) per 100,000 per annum in the same period (data available via http://www9.health.gov.au/cda/source/rpt_4.cfm). Disease typically occurs in adults between 25 and 39 years old, with no clear predominance in males or females. Symptomatic infections are rare in children. 1 RRV is endemic in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Most cases occur in northern Australia during the wet season (usually December-February) when mosquito numbers are high. In 1979-1980, RRV caused a large epidemic in the South Pacific (see Fig. 36 .5.1) where the virus may still be circulating.",

The virus is transmitted to humans from other vertebrates (and humans during epidemics) by mosquitoes, principally A. vigilax, A. camptorhynchus, and Culex annulorostris. 1 Enzootic transmission, complex ecology involving multiple hosts and vectors, and different modes of transmission in different biogeographic areas make the disease difficult to model and predict and hence hinder disease control. 3 Rheumatic disease is believed to arise from adaptive and innate immune responses directed at RRV antigens and RNA persisting in affected tissues. These responses produce arthritogenic proinflammatory mediators. 4,5 Joint effusions predominantly contain mononuclear cells, and RRV RNA has been detected in synovial fluids by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, joint aspirations and PCR have limited value for diagnosis. 6 RRV infections can be sub-clinical, with the asymptomatic-to-symptomatic ratio between 1.2 : 1 and 3.0 : 1. 1 Virus-specific antibodies, probably neutralizing antibodies, are believed to be the principal protective adaptive immune response to RRV. 7 Naturally acquired immunity appears to be lifelong, with no reports of re-infection.",

Rapid onset of arthritic symptoms is usual, with pain on movement, tenderness, and slight swelling (which can be hard to detect) the most common signs. Tenderness, swelling, heat, redness, and intolerance to movement or pressure can be extreme. The rash is usually maculopapular, occurs within a few days after the onset of symptoms, and resolves within 5 to 10 days. 4 Rash distribution varies considerably, with the trunk and limbs most affected. The face is less affected and, rarely, the rash may be confined to palms, soles, and/ or digital webs. Lymphadenopathy is frequently present, if sought. Aside from fatigue, constitutional symptoms usually resolve within a week. 1, 2, 4 Diagnosis is usually made by a primary-care physician aided by a commercial serodiagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based test (widely available in Australia). Two serologic tests at least 10 to 14 days apart are recommended. Peripheral blood counts are usually normal except for a possible slight neutrophilia. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate can occur, but decreases within a few weeks. Serum C-reactive protein levels are rarely elevated. If erosive changes are seen in x-rays, alternative diagnoses should be sought. 2, 8 The differential diagnoses at initial disease presentation include related Old World alphaviruses (e.g., chikungunya, Barmah Forest, or Sindbis virus 4 ), dengue, and Epstein-Barr virus. Other viral arthritides may also be considered, for example, rubella or parvovirus B19. 2, 5 Drug reactions, autoimmune arthritides (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and other infectious arthritides may also be among the differential diagnoses. Persistent distinct monoarticular arthritis is inconsistent with RRV disease. 2 In patients diagnosed with RRV disease but in whom symptoms last longer than 3 to 6 months, other differential diagnoses should be actively sought. In a survey of RRV disease patients, about half the patients reported disease lasting longer than 6 months. However, in nearly all these patients, other rheumatic conditions (primarily autoimmune) or depression were subsequently diagnosed. 8 There is no evidence that RRV disease predisposes to other rheumatic diseases, 8 but it may contribute to post-infective depression or fatigue. 10",

A large epidemic was recorded in the 1960s in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, involving an estimated 11,000 people. 1 Over the past five decades, it is estimated that more than half a million people have been infected by the virus in the tropical areas of South and Central America, mainly in the Amazon region of Brazil and Peru. 3, 4 EPIDEMIOLOGY OROV has been found in Brazil, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago, and is basically maintained by two different life cycles. One occurs in urban areas of tropical cities in the Amazon basin and involves humans as the vertebrate hosts, with Culicoides paraensis midges as the major arthropod vector. Transmission in general occurs outdoor in the daytime, especially during sunrise and sunset. The other described life cycle is sylvatic and not well understood and is based on serologic prevalence involving wild mammals (especially sloths and monkeys) and birds as the potential vertebrate hosts. The arthropod vector in the sylvatic life cycle is unknown, but may include C. paraensis. 1, 2 Many outbreaks of Oropouche fever have been characterized by epidemics spreading in numerous villages within one geographic area and over a short period; these episodes essentially occur in new colonized areas and in the suburbs of large Amazonian urban methods. The most commonly applied molecular method is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), [3] [4] [5] and recently a real-time PCR showed excellent results. 6 Virus isolation can be attempted in newborn mice or hamsters (1-3 days), or in Vero or C6/36 cell cultures. For viral identification, suspensions prepared from brains of mice or supernatants of infected Vero or C6/36 cells are used as antigens in complement fixation or immunofluorescence assays with OROV hyper-immune serum. More recently the molecular approaches have been used for genotyping and identification of isolates. [3] [4] [5] [6] For specific identification of OROV, neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests can be also performed. 2",

High-risk groups include farmers, ranchers, forest workers, and others who live in rural, hilly, wooded areas. Person-to-person transmission through direct contact with blood or bloody secretions has been reported. 7, 8 SFTSV is phylogenetically separated into two clades, Chinese and Japanese, with viruses usually (though not always) consistent with their geographic origin. Korean strains fall within the Japanese clade. 9 Pathogenesis: SFTSV infection generally has four overlapping stages: incubation, febrile illness, multi-organ involvement, and convalescence (all four stages may not occur in milder infections). The incubation period is generally 5 to 14 days, and can be affected by viral dose and route of infection. Viremia peaks during the febrile illness stage at about 7 to 10 days after fever onset, and high viremia may be associated with poor outcomes. 10, 11 Very high viremia can occur, accompanied by uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response. During the multi-organ involvement stage, viremia gradually falls in survivors, but remains high in fatal cases. Viral components have been detected in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. 12 The marked thrombocytopenia typical of SFTS has been proposed to be due to splenic macrophage clearance of circulating virus-bound platelets. 13 Clinical features: SFTS presents as a non-specific febrile illness with sudden onset of fever lasting for 5 to 11 days, headache, fatigue, malaise, muscle and joint pain, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea, accompanied by thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, which occur in almost all patients, and abnormal liver function tests. Multi-organ involvement can occur about 5 days after illness onset, lasting for 7 to 14 days, with progressive failure in fatal cases or a self-limited course in survivors. Progressive organ failure can be rapid, first in the liver and heart, then the lungs and kidneys. About one fifth of patients can have central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, including apathy, seizures, muscle tremors, and/ or coma. Death can occur in 12% to 30% of cases, with the average time between illness onset and death being 9 days. 12, 14 Poor outcomes are more likely in patients with advanced age, decreased consciousness, underlying disease, bleeding tendencies, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase, prolonged activated partial prothrombin times, and elevated C-reactive protein during the disease course.

No vaccine is available for SFTS, and prevention consists of avoidance of tick bites. Health care providers should adhere to strict contact and droplet precautions due to the risk of environmental contamination and person-to-person transmission, especially when treating critically ill patients. 22",

Transmission is thought to occur through the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum). [24] [25] [26] No animal reservoir has yet been confirmed, although neutralizing antibodies have been detected in a variety of animals, including horses, deer, raccoons, and coyotes. 27, 28 Pathogenesis: The pathogenesis of HRTV is not well understood, given the low number of cases. HRTV has been detected in the brain (thalamus), liver, gallbladder, pancreas, heart, lung, large and small bowel, kidney, and testes, in addition to bone marrow, lymph node, and splenic tissue. 29 Clinical features: HRTV disease presents with fever, fatigue, headache, cough, joint and muscle pain, nausea, and diarrhea, with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Patients can have confusion with short-term memory loss lasting up to several months. Death has occurred in at least two confirmed cases with wide dissemination of virus and multi-organ failure. 29, 30 Diagnosis: HRTV disease should be considered in older men from the Midwestern United States with non-specific febrile illness and a history of tick bite exposure. Laboratory diagnosis can be performed at specialized laboratories using RT-PCR, IgM/IgG ELISA, and neutralization assays. 31 Differential diagnosis may include ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, West Nile virus infection, rickettsial infection, leptospirosis, and other etiologies. Treatment and prevention: No specific therapy is available, and clinical management is supportive.",

The virus has also been isolated in French Guiana, Colombia, Panama, and Peru. Detection of antibodies to the virus has been also demonstrated in certain populations of these countries, as well as in Guyana, Colombia, and Peru.2  Most cases occur in forest workers, who are typically adult males. In the Brazilian Amazon, the specific antibody rate ranges from 5% to 60%; it is higher among closed communities (South American Indians).Only a few major Mayaro fever epidemics have been reported in the Americas: two in Brazil, one in Bolivia, and one in Peru.2,6   Between 1955 and 1991, epidemics of Mayaro fever were restricted to Brazil, beginning in the municipality of Guam\u00e1, Par\u00e1 state (1955), and spreading toward other localities in the S\u00e3o Miguel do Par\u00e1 state, such as Belterra (1978), Concei\u00e7\u00e3o do Araguaia (1981), Itaruma in Goias state, the central region of Brazil (1981), Benevides, Par\u00e1 state (1991), and Peixe, Tocantins state (1991).

Facial flushing and rapid heart rate can sometimes occur. However, Toscana virus can cause encephalitis, meningitis, and peripheral neuropathy. 35, 37 In most Toscana virus-infected patients, fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting with nuchal rigidity occur, and depressed consciousness can be present in about 10% of cases. CSF shows mild pleocytosis with elevated protein and glucose levels, although protein and glucose may be normal. 37, 40, 41 In addition to Toscana virus, SFTV can cause severe disease, including rarely CNS infections. 33, 42, 43 Diagnosis: Laboratory diagnosis is performed at specialized laboratories. RT-PCR can be performed for direct detection. Serologic testing can be done by IgM/IgG ELISA, with neutralization assays performed for confirmation. Viral isolation from blood or CSF can be done using mammalian cell lines. [43] [44] [45] Treatment and prevention: No specific therapy is available, and clinical management is supportive.
