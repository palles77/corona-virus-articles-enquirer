The criteria represent top level factors which might impact the relevance of a disease to the R&D Blueprint, such as the human transmissibility of the disease, or the societal impact. The sub-criteria then explore different facets of each of these areas, for example",

Following feedback from the R&D Blueprint's Scientific Advisory Group in May 2016, and the subsequent work of the methodology review meeting in November 2016, the original nine criteria were compressed into the current eight criteria below to insure completeness, non-redundancy, nonoverlapping and preference independence (2).",

Severity or Case-Fatality Rate Subcriteria a) The disease causes high mortality b) The disease frequently causes high morbidity, including severe complications or sequelae 4. The Human-Animal Interface a) The involvement of animals in transmitting (including arthropods) the disease to people is well characterized b) There are transmission routes from animals (including arthropods) to humans likely to result in high levels of human infections c) The pathogen is capable of infecting multiple animal species d) The animal species transmitting the disease are widely distributed e) The animal species transmitting the disease is abundant f) Arthropod(s) are responsible for transmitting the disease g) Arthropod(s) responsible for transmitting the disease are widely distributed 5. Other Factors Subcriteria: a) The geographic range of the pathogen has changed b) The pathogen shares relevant epidemiologic and/or genotypic characteristics with agents which have caused important epidemics c) The natural disease does not result in robust protective immunity d) The disease carries a high risk of occupational exposure for those involved in a response (including for culling, vets, burial details, lab workers, first responders, healthcare workers) e) The pathogen is an agent likely to be used to cause deliberate outbreaks 6. The Public Health Context of the Affected Area Subcriteria a) The disease requires targeted surveillance (i.e., not likely to be detected by routine surveillance but which might be detected by active or sentinel surveillance) b) Disease control requires specialist interventions (such as highly skilled personnel; equipment, such as isolation units, respirators, PPE, etc.; and infection control measures) disease can result in major economic impact e) The disease can result in a major disruption to healthcare delivery 8. The Evolutionary Potential of the Pathogen Subcriteria a) There is evidence of rapid pathogen evolution b) There is a trend toward increasing severity of the disease c) There is a trend toward the increasing transmissibilty of the pathogen From the outset, there was an understanding that these different criteria may not have an equal impact on relevance to the R&D Blueprint and therefore whether a disease needs to be prioritized. As an initial step, the 2015 consultation experts ranked the criteria they identified but recommended a semiquantitative approach be developed (1). During 2016 WHO developed the current process which uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to undertake a pair-wise review of criteria. Experts participating in the November 2016 Methodology Review committee were surveyed as to the relative importance of the prioritization criteria (3). The overall 2016 criteria weights are in Technical Appendix 2 Figure.",
