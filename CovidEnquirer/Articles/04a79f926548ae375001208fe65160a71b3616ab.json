More than 1600 people infected with the virus from 26 countries have been reported to WHO, including more than 600 related deaths. 1 As a result of a large hospital outbreak at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 2 between August and September, 2015, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of National Guard Health Aff airs organised a 2 day research initiative workshop on Sept 9-10, 2015, to make recommendations for therapeutic (panel 1) and non-therapeutic (panel 2) research on MERS-CoV. Recognising the crucial role of scientifi c and political partnerships, the Ministry of National Guard Health Aff airs invited key representatives of regional and international health agencies and experts in basic and translational science, diagnostics, therapeutics, epidemiology, infection prevention and control, clinical research, and public health. Several pharmaceutical companies presented the status of MERS-CoV treatment candidates in development. Primary objectives were to exchange knowledge and prioritise potential treatments for assessment in clinical trials in Saudi Arabia.",

Although demonstration of a reduction in mortality is the ideal goal of any treatment-based clinical trial, the ability to validly show a mortality reduction can be hampered by the likelihood that an absolute mortality reduction greater than 5-10% is, historically, unlikely for many interventions and especially so when used after an infection has caused severe illness and organ dysfunction, and by the likely infeasibility for studies to enrol the thousands of patients necessary to show a less than 10% absolute reduction in mortality. Therefore, although measuring mortality is essential, trials should consider other important endpoints, including biological markers of eff ect (eg, viral load in biological samples), especially for early phase clinical assessments safety and anti-MERS-CoV effi cacy in appropriate animal models. At present, none of these treatment candidates have suffi cient clinical data to support their use in clinical care. Because this knowledge base is evolving dynamically, new evidence should be continually reassessed.",
