            "text": "The ability of human cells to defend against viruses originating from distant species has long been ignored. Owing to the pressure of natural evolution and human exploration, some of these viruses may be able to invade human beings. If their 'fresh' host had no defences, the viruses could cause a serious pandemic, as seen with HIV, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and avian influenza virus that originated from chimpanzees, the common palm civet and birds, respectively. It is unknown whether the human immune system could tolerate invasion with a plant virus. To model such an alien virus invasion, we chose TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) and used human epithelial carcinoma cells (HeLa cells) as its 'fresh' host. We established a reliable system for transfecting TMV-RNA into HeLa cells and found that TMV-RNA triggered autophagy in HeLa cells as shown by the appearance of autophagic vacuoles, the conversion of LC3-I (light chain protein 3-I) to LC3-II, the up-regulated expression of Beclin1 and the accumulation of TMV protein on autophagosomal membranes. We observed suspected TMV virions in HeLa cells by TEM (transmission electron microscopy). Furthermore, we found that TMV-RNA was translated into CP (coat protein) in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and that TMV-positive RNA translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus. Finally, we detected greatly increased expression of GRP78 (78 kDa glucose-regulated protein), a typical marker of ERS (ER stress) and found that the formation of autophagosomes was closely related to the expanded ER membrane. Taken together, our data indicate that HeLa cells used ERS and ERS-related autophagy to defend against TMV-RNA.",

Due to the high frequency of viral mutation and reproduction, the ability of viruses to escape from host immune proteasomal degradation is difficult to predict. Although numerous studies have identified viral immune escape mechanisms [1, 2] , there is insufficient evidence to fully define these mechanisms in detail. One reason for this lack of evidence is that viruses hosts diverge farther away from humans, yet all of these virulent viruses have crossed the species barrier to invade humans. It is important to speculate from which distant species a new virus will emerge to invade humans in the next disaster. Such a virus may be from a plant, whose origin is even more distant from humans. Due to the pressure of natural selection and human exploration in the biosphere, it is possible for a plant virus to evolve the ability to invade the human body as its 'fresh' host, regardless of whether it has a specific receptor on human cellular membranes.",

In addition to having the ability to infect plant hosts, especially tobacco [9] , previous reports have shown that TMV-prosomes can be detected in vertebrate cells and animal cells, which suggests that TMV has the ability to cross species. For instance, Knowland showed that RNA from TMV can be translated inside oocytes of the frog, Xenopus laevis [10] ; Salomon and Bar-Joseph [11] reported that RNA from both TMV strains were likely translated in rabbit reticulocytes; and Dimitriadis and Georgatsos [12] indicated that synthesis of the TMV CP (coat protein) followed the migration of viral RNA into isolated mouse liver mitochondria. These studies prompted us to investigate whether TMV-RNA has biological activity in human cells. Studies to date have been limited not only to the study of plant infection but also to other species. However, increasing evidence has indicated that some viruses can cross species [3, 13] . Herein, we tested the novel idea that TMV might evolve to invade human cells.",

The replication of TMV-RNA in tobacco protoplasts is similar to that of other positive-stranded RNA viruses, and it takes place in two stages; first, synthesis of a minus strand using the viral plus strand RNA as a template is followed by synthesis of progeny plus strands using the minus strand as a template. Secondly, the negative strand acts as a template for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs for the MP (movement protein) and the CP [8] . The MP RNA is produced transiently, whereas the replicase and CP RNAs are produced constitutively during infection [14] . CP regulates the formation of replication complexes during TMV infection [15] and it has been highly conserved during evolution in contrast with other TMV proteins that vary from species to species [16] . In previous studies, CP has been shown to be produced in the frog X. laevis, in rabbit reticulocytes and in mouse liver mitochondria [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "Autophagy is a conserved pathway that functions in all eukaryotic organisms to maintain cellular homoeostasis. The autophagy pathway targets both cellular cytoplasmic constituents (such as damaged or surplus organelles, proteins and protein aggregates) for lysosomal degradation as well as microbial invaders (including viruses). Molecular steps are required for autophagosomal formation that involves a double-layered vesicle that fuses with a lysosome to digest the material inside the vacuole [17] . It is known that viral infection of a cell may stimulate autophagy [18] . Ubiquitin-like LC3 (light-chain protein 3) has been used as a specific marker for the autophagosomal compartment. Two forms of LC3, the cytosolic LC3-I and the membrane-bound LC3-II, are produced post-translationally. LC3-I is formed by the removal of the C-terminal 22 amino acids from newly synthesized LC3, followed by the conversion of a fraction of LC3-I into LC3-II. The induction of autophagy leads to the processing of LC3-I into LC3-II and its subsequent targeting to pre-autophagosomal and autophagosomal membranes [19] . Beclin1 is a mammalian autophagy gene, and its increased expression suggests increased cellular autophagic activity. In addition, Beclin1 can also bind to Bcl-2 and inhibit tumorigenesis, is monoallelically deleted in human breast and ovarian cancers and is expressed at reduced levels in the latter tumours [20, 21] .",

To import intact TMV particles or TMV-RNA into HeLa cells, we used two methodologies: electroporation or liposome transfection, respectively. Following the electroporation procedure [27] , intact TMV particles were transformed into HeLa cells by electric shock with different voltages (0, 140, 280 and 360 V). Western blotting results showed that there was a little more CP expression in HeLa cells treated with 280 V than with the other voltages, but not high enough in CP expression ( Figure 1A-a) . This result suggests that some cells may have been fatally damaged by the strong electric currents. Thus we concluded that electroporation was not the proper method for TMV transfection. Recent reports have demonstrated that the liposome transfection method is more effective and less toxic to cells than other transfection methods [28] . Thus we used this method for TMV-RNA transfection. HeLa cells were incubated with a mixture of TMV-RNA and liposomes at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 for 6 h. Western blot analysis showed that CP was produced more abundantly at the ratio of 1:1 than 1:2 ( Figure 1A -b), indicating that TMV-RNA can be effectively transfected into HeLa cells by using an equal proportion of liposomes. Moreover, the morphology of the cells did not change during the process of incubation. Thus we found an effective way to import TMV-RNA into HeLa cells, and this technique was applied exclusively in the following experiments.",

At 24 h post-transfection, we found that some vacuoles were produced in the cytoplasm of the HeLa cells. After 72 h, the proportion of vacuoles was more than 50% per microscopic field of vision. To determine whether autophagy was triggered after transfection, the ultrastructure of HeLa cells transfected with TMV-RNA for 6, 24, 48 and 72 h was analysed by TEM. Numerous vacuoles and some membrane-bound vacuoles characteristic of autophagosomes (arrowheads) were observed in the cytoplasm of the transfected cells ( Figure 1C , T-6 h, T-24 h). Moreover, typical mature autophagosomes with double-membrane vacuolar structures containing visible cytoplasmic contents increased over time ( Figure 1C , T-48 h, T-72 h; Figure 1D ). Vacuoles were only rarely found in cells not transfected with TMV-RNA ( Figure 1C , Con), and only a few vacuoles were observed in cells incubated with liposomes only ( Figure 1C , Lipo). The latter result suggests that the quantity of liposomes administered was less toxic to cells.",

We found that the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II was augmented if TMV-RNA treatment was extended to 72 h ( Figure 1B) . To monitor alterations in autophagic flux mediated by TMV-RNA, an immunoblot-based LC3 flux assay using flow cytometry was performed to quantify the number of autophagosomes. As shown in Figure 1 (E), cells with autophagosomes detected using an FITC-conjugated anti-LC3 antibody were increased in HeLa cells following TMV-RNA transfection, whereas the expression of LC3-II was almost undetectable in the untransfected cells. Moreover, 3-MA, a common inhibitor of autophagy [29] , was used to block autophagy in HeLa cells. In TMV-RNA-transfected cells treated with 3-MA (5 mM, Sigma) for 24 h, autophagy was markedly inhibited. Altogether, these observations suggest that TMV-RNA induces autophagy in HeLa cells.",

To examine whether the key autophagy gene (Beclin1) [21] was synergistically activated during TMV-RNA-induced autophagy, real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed to monitor the nucleic acid and protein levels, respectively, of Beclin1. Beclin1 mRNA increased markedly when the transfection time was extended to 72 h ( Figure 2A) . Simultaneously, Beclin1 protein markedly accumulated within 24 h in TMV-RNA-treated HeLa cells, and the accumulation of protein was much more pronounced when the transfection time was extended to 72 h ( Figure 2B ). Neither Beclin1 nucleic acid nor Beclin1 protein was found in HeLa cells not transfected with TMV-RNA. To verify that the activation of Beclin1 in HeLa cells was indeed associated with TMV-RNA-induced autophagy, a human breastcancer cell line in which Beclin1 is monoallelically deleted and thus expressed at reduced levels (MCF7 cells) [30] was transfected with TMV-RNA using the same protocol. Additionally, to interfere with the expression of the Beclin1 gene in cells we also transfected a Beclin1 siRNA (small interfering RNA) vector into HeLa cells. The Beclin1 siRNA vector was transfected into HeLa cells 24 h before the transfection of TMV-RNA. Analysis of the expression of Beclin1 and LC3 in MCF7 cells or HeLa cells by Western blotting showed that no Beclin1 was detected in MCF7 cells with or without TMV-RNA transfection, and the expression level of LC3 in MCF7 cells did not change after transfection ( Figure 2C) . Moreover, the expression of both LC3 and Beclin1 in HeLa cells transfected with both the Beclin1 siRNA vector and TMV-RNA was reduced compared with cells transfected with TMV-RNA only ( Figures 2B and 2C) . Taken together, the invasion of TMV-RNA directly results in autophagy, and Be-clin1 is the key autophagy gene in TMV-RNA-transfected HeLa cells.",

TMV can utilize the host ER as the primary site of envelope glycoprotein biogen-esis, genomic replication and particle assembly. If the translation of TMV-RNA occurred in the ER, the accumulation of TMV protein would inevitably lead to cellular stress responses, such as ERS, which may promote autophagy in HeLa cells.

Early in synthesis, those mRNA/RNCs (ribosome/nascent polypeptide chain complexes) engaged in the synthesis of secretory/membrane proteins are trafficked to the ER because of the presence of an SRP (signal recognition particle) [32] .

Analysis of CP in the ER fraction by Western blotting showed that the expression level of CP markedly increased when the time was extended to 72 h ( Figure 4A ). To further confirm whether CP was located in the ER and to observe the location of TMV-RNA, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) and FISH techniques [25] in succession. TMV-positive RNA and proteins were identified in situ by confocal microscopy in cells fixed by a protocol intended to retain native cell size and shape. The TMV-positive RNA was visualized by FISH with a strand-specific probe that was labelled with a Cy3 fluorochrome (red). CP was detected using a rabbit anti-CP antibody and a corresponding secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 anti-rabbit antibody) (green), and the ER was stained with ER tracker (blue, Invitrogen).

In recent immunoelectron microscopy studies, Dunn has reported that autophagosomes originating from pre-existing ER acquire lysosomal markers in a stepwise fashion during maturation into autolysosomes. Dunn also classified vacuoles morphologically and cytochemically into two groups: (i) nascent autophagic vacuoles (or autophagosomes) and (ii) degradative autophagic vacuoles (or autolysosomes) [34, 35] .

The nascent vacuoles appeared to be produced from the ends of ER membranes (arrowheads), and they expanded to resemble swollen fingers in some pictures. Such structures might be transported to form autophagosomes. Some images also demonstrated that the ER membrane expanded to resemble forks extending towards the anterior vacuole ( Figures 6B-b, 6B d and 6B-g), suggesting that partial ER membranes might be used to form phagophores, structures that will fuse with a nascent vacuole. Neither autophagic vacuoles nor the expansion of the ER was found in cells not transfected with TMV-RNA ( Figure 6B-a) . Taken together, there are a series of interesting events that are occurring; the distal end of the ER membrane expanded like swollen fingers or forks, which might indicate that the cells were stimulated by the TMV-RNA and induced into a state of ERS.

Moreover, the other distal end of the expanded ER membrane was sequestered in a vacuole ( Figure 6B-d, arrowheads) . The ER membrane expanded so greatly that it might have produced more vacuoles ( Figure 6B -e, arrowheads), with nascent vacuoles emerging from the end points of the expanded ER membranes ( Figure 6B -f, arrowheads). Moreover, fusion events might have occurred between lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles ( Figure 6B-f, pane) . Finally, a huge autolysosome formed in the cytoplasm, some partial ER membranes expanded to resemble forks extending towards the vacuole ( Figure 6B -g, two small panes) and one vacuole had just been produced from other partial ER membranes ( Figure 6B-g,  arrowheads) . Based on these data, it appeared that the process of autophagy, including the maturation and formation of autophagosomes, was required for the expansion of the ER membrane. Hence all of these observations confirmed that the membranes of TMV-RNA-related autophagic vacuoles might be contiguous with or originate from ER membranes. This result explains why more and more vacuoles appeared and accumulated around the expanded ER membranes when the transfection time was extended. We presume that, under ERS, the distal end of the ER membrane expands to maximize the transformation into more vacuoles, which when encapsulated by a monolayer membrane, are called phagophores (which might form from partially expanded ER membranes; see Figures 6B-c, 6B-d and B-f) . When expanded phagophore cisterns wrap around a portion of the cytoplasm and/or organelles, autophagy is triggered. During the autophagosomal maturation process, the segregated cytoplasm that is engulfed by a phagophore is delivered to the endo/lysosomal lumen by fusion events between autophagosomes and endosomal and/or lysosomal vesicles. Both the cytoplasm and the surrounding membrane are then degraded by lysosomal hydrolases, and the degradation products are transported back to the cytoplasm where they can be re-used for metabolism. Together with our data, the expansion of the ER induced by ERS results in the formation of autophagosomes in TMV-RNA-transfected HeLa cells.",

If enough TMV proteins are produced so that the capacity of GRP78 is exceeded, ERS stimulates the ends of ER membranes to expand to maximize sequestration into vacuoles in which TMV proteins (such as CP) might be produced. These new vacuoles are wrapped rapidly by phagophores (which also likely originate from the ER and look like the forks in our electron micrographs) that further form autophagosomes. Finally, with the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, autolysosomes form to digest the vacuolar contents; we suggest that these vacuolar contents might not be digested, but instead, immune escape occurs through some unknown molecular mechanism. The latter assertion is supported by our evidence of the accumulation of TMV proteins on and around autophagosomal membranes, by the increased CP in the ER and by the enrichment of TMV-positive RNA in the nucleolus. In conclusion, TMV-RNA induces ERS-related autophagy in HeLa cells, and a potential defence mechanism involving ERS and ERS-related autophagy utilized by HeLa cells against TMV-RNA is modelled in Figure 7 . Figure 7 Schematic diagram of the potential ERS-related autophagic defence mechanism utilized by HeLa cells against TMV-RNA After TMV-RNA enters HeLa cells, it is translated into protein by ribosomes located on the ER membrane. TMV proteins, such as CP , will likely be recognized as foreign or unfolded proteins in the ER lumen and trigger ERS. GRP78 is a marker of ERS, is highly expressed and acts as a chaperone to assist in the folding of CP . If the quantity of CP is too great, GRP78 might leave CP and stimulate the distal end of ER membranes to expand and swell to sequester CP into vacuoles. These new vacuoles would be enwrapped rapidly by phagophores, which likely originate from the ER. These new phagophores resemble forks extending towards the vacuole, and they engulf it to promote maturation into double-membrane autophagosomes. Finally, by fusion with a lysosome, autophagosomes become mono-membrane-structured autolysosomes.",

For example, MyD88 and Trif, two signalling adaptors for TLRs, interact with the autophagy protein, Beclin1, in a manner that is enhanced by TLR signalling, and shRNA (small-hairpin RNA) knockdown of MyD88, Trif or Beclin1 inhibits TLR-induced autophagy. Here, we detected the marked accumulation of Beclin1 in HeLa cells, and we also identified the key role of Beclin1 in cellular autophagy; however, whether Beclin1 also associates with TLR signalling adaptor molecules, (thereby further mediating autophagy) was not investigated.",

            "text": "TLR7 is an endosomal receptor that is expressed in endosomes, which fuse with lysosomes [38] . Autophagosomes are formed by the expansion of phagophores and fusion with lysosomes. Thus there should exist some relationship between TLR7 activation and autophagy. Delgado et al. [39] have indicated that TLRs control autophagy, and Iwasaki [18] has shown that VSV (vesicular-stomatitis virus) recognition via TLR7 requires cytosolic viral replication intermediates that are transported to the lysosome by means of autophagy. In our present study, we have shown by immunoelectron microscopy that TMV protein accumulated on autophagosomal membranes. Moreover, at 4 h post-transfection, we observed by confocal microscopy that TMV-RNA co-localized with autophagosomes on the ER (see Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.bioscirep.org/bsr/032/bsr0320171add.htm). These observations indicate that both TMV-RNA and TMV protein might appear on autophagosomal membranes simultaneously and that they might be bound together as cytosolic viral replication intermediates to be transported by autophagosomes. Hence TMV-RNA and 'cytosolic viral replication intermediates' might be recognized by TLR7 during the maturation of autophagy. . Autophagy may function either as an antiviral pathway (that degrades viruses) or as a pro-viral pathway (that helps viruses replicate or exit from cells) [18, 40] . If TMV-RNA is recognized by TLR7, it would be engulfed by the host cell through the process of endocytosis and digested by lysosomal enzymes. Both TMV-RNA and TMV protein would therefore be removed through this pathway. However, here, we not only demonstrated the accumulation of CP in the ER, but we also unexpectedly observed that TMV-positive RNA moved from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Even more surprisingly, we discovered suspected TMV virions in HeLa cells by TEM. Although this evidence is not sufficient by itself to determine whether TMV-RNA replicates in HeLa cells, we found that not all of TMV-RNA or TMV protein was digested during the process of autophagy. Thus we presume that autophagy functions as a pro-viral pathway after the invasion of TMV into HeLa cells, which might aid in TMV-RNA replication in HeLa cells. Some recent reports have demonstrated that viruses use accumulated autophagosomes for their replication. In these reports, an even more dramatic subversion of macroautophagy is induced by several ssRNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm. Picornaviruses (poliovirus and rhinoviruses), coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus and SARS) and one arterivirus (equine arteritis virus) replicate on the surface of autophagosomal membranes [40] [41] [42] . These viruses likely block the fusion of autophagosomes that carry the viral replication complexes with lysosomes. The generation of autophagic membranes as scaffolds for the replication machinery is essential because inhibition of macroautophagy by siRNA-mediated silencing of Atg12 or Atg8 (LC3) inhibits viral replication [40] [41] [42] . Based on these discoveries, we attempted to determine why TMV protein accumulated on autophagosomal membranes when the transfection time was extended and whether the translation of TMV-RNA was associated with the maturation of autophagosomes. To address these questions, we first sought to demonstrate the replication of TMV-RNA in HeLa cells; we need to find the production of TMV-negative RNA in HeLa cells, evidence of TMV particles isolated from HeLa cells by EM and the occurrence of viral passage in HeLa cells. When the replication of TMV-RNA in HeLa cells is further verified, a mouse tumour model could be established by administering TMV-RNA-treated HeLa cells or untreated HeLa cells in vivo and assessing whether TMV-RNA can also induce autophagy and replication in vivo. Although autophagy is primarily a protective process for the cell, it can also play a role in cell death. Thus, if TMV-RNA-induced autophagy occurs in vivo, it would cause rapid tumour cell death, further inhibiting the growth of the tumour. If this scenario proves true, TMV-RNA may be used as a therapy for human tumours in the future.",

[33] discovered that ER proliferation was accompanied by the formation of autophagosomal-like structures that were densely and selectively packed with membrane stacks derived from the UPR (unfolded protein response)-expanded ER. Ueno et al. [43] showed that ER membrane markers were pre-served in autophagic vacuolar membranes isolated from the rat liver vacuoles of animals administered leupeptin. Axe et al. [44] reported that autophagosomal formation from membrane compartments enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate was dynamically linked to the ER and that a ring-like particle (termed an omegasome) formed, indicating that the autophagosome formed in close association with the ER. Herein, we also described a likely process of TMV-RNA-induced autophagy ( Figure 6B) . A series of electron micrographs provided potent evidence for the expansion of ER membranes into mature autophagosomes. Thus we conclude that ERS stimulates ER membranes to expand and form autophagosomes.",

We observed the locations of TMV-RNA, autophagosomes and the ER in live cells with a Zeiss LSM 510 Inverted Live-Cell Confocal System. TMV-RNA was labelled with CTAB-QDs (red) [45] , autophagosomes were labelled with GFP-LC3 (green) and the ER was stained with ER tracker (blue). At 4 h post-transfection with TMV-RNA, we observed TMV-RNA as red dots and the ER as blue fluorescence. The formation of GFP-LC3-labelled structures (GFP-LC3 dots), representing autophagosomes was observed in cells, as was the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II. Notably, the red dots co-localized with some punctate GFP-LC3 staining, and they also appeared in conjunction with the ER (blue) (Supplementary Figure S1B) , whereas the GFP-LC3 dots decreased in cells transfected with GFP-LC3 alone (Supplementary Figure S1A) . Hence TMV-RNA might colocalize with autophagosomes on the ER. This result indicates a direct connection among TMV-RNA, autophagosomes and the ER, a result that is also supported by the previous data showing that autophagosomes appear to originate from the ER membrane. Because the process occurred in a short period of time, we have to consider that autophagy might play a vital role in cellular innate immunity, especially against mutated viruses.",

Although we have strong morphological evidence, we still require evidence at the molecular level to further uncover the direct relationships among TMV, ERS and autophagy. We found that the translation of TMV-RNA induced ERS, and this effect was verified by the accumulation of GRP78 in the ER. As an ER chaperone, GRP78 not only binds to unfolded proteins but also regulates the activation of ERS transducers, such as IRE1, PERK and ATF6. With the accumulation of TMV proteins, GRP78 would inevitably interact with the viral proteins as well as activate ERS signal transduction proteins, causing other cellular responses, such as the UPR and autophagy. Li showed that the UPR regulator and ER chaperone, GRP78/BiP, was required for stressinduced autophagy [50] .

(a) TMV was transfected into HeLa cells by electroporation at voltages of 0, 140, 280 and 350. Western blotting was performed for TMV CP using lysates from HeLa cells transfected with TMV for 24 h. (b) TMV-RNA (T-RNA) was transfected into HeLa cells using liposomes at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 (T-RNA/Lipo); HeLa cells treated with liposomes only (Lipo) were used as the negative control and those treated with wild-type TMV were used as the positive control. Western blotting was performed for CP using lysates from TMV or HeLa cells transfected for 24 h. More CP was detected at ratios of 1:1 than 1:2. Thus liposome transfection of TMV-RNA was more effective and less toxic to HeLa cells than electroporation. \u03b2-Actin was used as a loading control. (C) Transmission electron micrographs of the ultrastructure of HeLa cells with or without TMV-RNA at different H.P .T. times. Autophagic vacuoles and acidic vesicular organelles were observed in the cytoplasm (arrowheads), and the vacuoles increased with increasing transfection time.

(E) An immunoblot-based LC3 flux assay by flow cytometry was used to monitor alterations in TMV-RNA-mediated autophagic flux. Analysis of LC3 in HeLa cells revealed that the percentage of cells with autophagosomes increased markedly when they were transfected with PBS (Con) or TMV-RNA for 24 or 48 h, whereas fewer autophagosomes were observed in cells treated with 3-MA (an autophagy inhibitor, 5 mM). *P < 0.001.
