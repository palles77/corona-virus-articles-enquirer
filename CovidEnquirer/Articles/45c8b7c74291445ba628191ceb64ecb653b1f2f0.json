A good history is important to obtain clues of exposure to malaria and other infections, when, where, and how often this may have occurred. Knowledge of the incubation periods is helpful to rule out certain illnesses. A thorough physical examination is mandatory. Malaria has many manifestations and the presenting clinical picture may be one that is dominated by symptoms and signs that favor other diagnoses such as an influenza-like illness, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, encephalitis, and hepatitis. Moreover, the number of pathogens that mimic malaria is also broad (Table 17. 3). The key to resolving this diagnostic challenge is laboratory confirmation of malaria as quickly as possible (see upcoming discussion). The diagnosis may be ruled out if three consecutive malaria blood films (preferably in conjunction with rapid tests), examined at 6-to 12-hour intervals, are negative within 24-48 hours. Malaria causes a third of imported fevers and a coinfection with another pathogen should be suspected if patients remain febrile despite effective antimalarial treatment.

In one European series of 185 patients with imported severe malaria (2006 WHO criteria), the main features seen were (i) hyperparasitemia >5% (~71%), (ii) jaundice (44%), (iii) impaired consciousness/coma (25%), (iv) acute kidney injury (19%), (v) shock (15%), (vi) respiratory failure/ARDS (12%), (vii) spontaneous bleeding (7%), (viii) acidosis (5%), (ix) hypoglycemia (3%), and (x) multiple convulsions (2%). 4 The median number of WHO criteria was 2, and some 40% of patients had an underlying comorbidity. These data are broadly consistent with those from an earlier series of 400 patients, reported by Bruneel et al. 5 who highlighted the contribution of microscopy-few of the many available kits detect parasitemia <100/\u00b5L, and lower sensitivity for P. vivax malaria is typical. No kit reveals parasite counts or stages present. Rapid tests designed to detect only P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2) will be negative for all other species, including P. knowlesi. Non-P. falciparum malaria can be detected with rapid tests containing a pan antigen strip but tend to be less sensitive.
