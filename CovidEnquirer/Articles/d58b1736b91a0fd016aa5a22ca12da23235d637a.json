For example, close examination of the sequences and physical properties of antibodies that have reached advanced stages of development will likely provide useful guidelines for novel antibody developability. Max Vasquez (Adimab) will kick off the workshop with his analysis of over 140 antibodies providing deep insight into factors to improve successful outcomes. Next, Devin Tesar (Genentech) will describe efforts to engineer molecules with long vitreal half-lives to improve therapy for age-related macular degeneration. A major outcome of this work is the finding that hydrodynamic size is a key contributor to the rate of vitreal clearance. Isolation of stable, highly productive cell lines remains a critical step in development of a large scale manufacturing process. Optimization of pre-clinical Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line development will be covered by Bo Yu (Larix Bioscience). Big Pharma and small biotech are increasingly outsourcing the late stage development and manufacturing of their biologics. Success at this expensive step can be 'make-or-break' for the drug candidate, so selection of the most appropriate contract manufacturing organization (CMO) is critical. Stephen Chamow (Chamow & Associates, Inc.) will discuss the process of successfully identifying and managing a CMO to help ensure a successful Phase 1 clinical study.",

            "text": "The term, \"immune repertoire\", refers to the collection of immunoglobulins (Igs), B-cell receptors and T-cell receptors (TcRs) produced by the B-and T-lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system. These immune-receptor repertoires are extremely diverse, and comprise multiple cellular subsets. Initially, \"na\u20ac \u0131ve\" B-cell and T-cell subsets are generated in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively, by the recombination of \"germline\" V, D and J gene segments, yielding VDJ recombinants that encode the V domain of a complete Ig heavy chain or TcR beta chain. Following a \"productive VDJ rearrangement\", germline V and J gene segments are then recombined to encode the V domain of Ig light chains or TcR alpha chains. Three mechanisms of diversification at the joints between V-D, D-J and V-J gene segments lend further diversity to the antigen-contacting regions of Igs and TcRs: imprecise joining, and the addition of N and P nucleotides. Thus, the diversity of the initial, \"na\u20ac \u0131ve\" repertoires is produced both by combinatorial diversity at the levels of germline gene recombination and through the combination of heavy and light or alpha and beta chains. After undergoing positive and negative selection, functional na\u20ac \u0131ve Band T-cell repertoires circulate through the secondary lymphoid tissues, where they encounter antigens. With the proper stimulation, antigen-binding clones are activated to divide and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells, \"memory\" B cells, and activated CD4C and CD8C T cells. In addition, often with the help of CD4C T cells, B cells undergo isotype switching (from IgM and IgD to IgG, IgA and/or IgE), and accumulate somatic hypermutations in their functional IGHV and IGLV gene regions. Thus, through the process of antigen recognition, antigen-activated B and T cells become \"clonally expanded\", and from successive rounds of somatic hypermutation, B cells will also form \"lineages\" expressing clonally related Igs.",

            "text": "B and T cells form the heart of adaptive immune responses, and are key to our understanding of health and disease, and to the development of therapeutics and vaccines. As such, there is keen interest in methods that can characterize the repertoires of various na\u20ac \u0131ve, memory and effector B-and T-cell subsets. Over the past 5-6 years, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has been adapted to characterize antibody and T-cell receptor repertoires from the blood and other tissues of people and animals. Briefly, mRNA from B or T cells is converted to cDNA, their recombined V(D)J regions are then PCR amplified and sequenced, using either primers specific for the entire set of germline genes or by 5 0 RACE to cover the 5 0 end of the V region, and constant-region-specific primers to cover the 3 0 end; this produces tens-to hundreds-of-thousands of sequences. Band T-cell clonal expansions can be deduced from analysis of these sequences, and B-cell clonal lineages can be deduced from the somatic mutation patterns of closely related clones. Analysis of B-and T-cell repertoires derived from different cellular compartments (e.g., blood vs. solid tissue) can reflect clonal migration, whereas repertoire analysis of different cellular subsets can reflect pathways of clonal differentiation.",

            "text": "Yet, in view of the amazing insights that immune repertoire analyses can now provide, there are significant bioinformatics challenges in taking such analyses to the next level of biological integration. This session is focused on the challenges posed in integrating immune repertoire data with other, large-scale and complex biological data. Session co-chair, George Georgiou, will describe his approach to quantifying individual antibodies comprising the serum antibody response through a combination of HTS of the recombined Ig genes from antigen-specific B cells and mass-spectrometric analysis of peptide fragments generated from antigen-specific Igs from the blood. Examples of deep analyses of serum antibodies elicited by vaccination and against pathogenic cells will be described. Brandon DeKosky (Vaccine Research Center, NIH) will follow with the use of paired VH-VL read technology in developing sequential vaccines that reiterate the ontogeny of neutralizing antibody development for a class of HIV-specific antibodies. Daniel Emerling (Atreca, Inc.) will report on clinicallevel studies of immune repertoires based on sequence analysis of the two chains of antibodies. One example involves patients during a vaccine trial, with Ig-repertoire analyses of B-cells and plasmablasts informing vaccine strategies. Ludvig Sollid (University of Oslo) has been working on the role of B-and T-cells and antigens in celiac disease; he will describe the interaction of antibody and TcR repertoires, along with the role of proteolytic products of the autoantigen, gluten, in driving this disease. Jake Glanville (Stanford University) has developed methods for deducing antigen specific B and T-cell receptors out of high-throughput sequencing data. This would provide a computational approach to identifying both B-and T-cell clones involved in immunological processes, including in the absences of knowledge of the etiological agent. Johanna Olweus (Oslo University Hospital) will describe her approach of using the TcR-repertoire data derived from healthy individuals to discover TcRs that can recognize cancer neoantigens. This provides a way of discovering cancer-specific TcRs that can be \"implanted\" into autologous T cells, then expanded and activated to specifically attack a patient's tumor cells. These presentations will provide excellent examples of the burgeoning systems-biology approaches currently under development, in which \"big data\" characterizing different, complex biological processes are integrated to reveal important new insights and discoveries. Antibodies have naturally evolved to work together. Protective polyclonal antibody responses against pathogens typically consist of complex mixtures of antibodies directed against distinct disease-related targets and epitopes. Antibody mixtures thereby provide an ability to target disease heterogeneity and plasticity and to prevent escape. Strikingly, most approved passive immunotherapy approaches (i.e., based on administering purified, recombinant antibodies with defined specificity) are still being developed as monotherapies. In the search for more potent and effective treatments, it therefore makes a lot of sense to investigate the educated assembly of antibody combinations in bispecific and designer polyclonal preparations. In addition to widening target binding, antibody-mediated effector functions are more effective when antibodies work in close concert with each other. This session will report new insights into the selection and design of bi-and multi-specific antibody therapeutics and investigate the implications for the mechanisms of action of such products.",

After the break, Guanbo Wang (Nanjing Normal University) will dive into the molecular mechanism by which IgG antibodies connect to activate complement, thereby providing insights into how antibodies might be further improved for enhanced cooperation and effector activity. Jeffrey Kearns (Merrimack Pharmaceuticals) will demonstrate how computational model-guided selection led to the design and development of a polyclonal preparation consisting of three anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies that surpasses its individual components both in terms of activity and mechanisms. Joost Neijssen (Genmab) finally will discuss the intricacies of selecting optimal anti-EGFR and anti-cMet antibody binding arms for a bispecific antibody.

As research has increasingly focused on finding treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, it has become clear that their common involvement of misfolded protein aggregation and accumulation has given way to significant differentiation in the molecular properties of their aggregated proteins. This session highlights how this has led creative scientists to exploit the diversity of antibodies to target the proteins underlying neurodegenerative disease pathology, with antibodies as detoxifying species and the vehicles of vaccine action.",

His group was the first to select scFv antibodies that target distinct conformers of PD neurodegeneration proteins using phage library selection with atomic force microscopy. 7, 8 These reagents show potential as both therapeutics and biomarkers. [9] [10] [11] Eliezer Masliah (UC San Diego) will discuss his research on therapeutic antibody 12 and vaccine 13 approaches for PD, PD dementia, dementia with Lewy body atrophy, and multiple system atrophy. These are related neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by abnormal accumulation of a-syn aggregates in brain, which are the second most common cause of neurodegeneration after AD in the elderly. He and his collaborators recently developed a transgenic mouse neuronal model for PD that recapitulates the induction of human a-syn fibril formation. 14 Other recent research has been devoted to non-invasive live cell imaging of a-syn-GFP aggregates in the retina of mice that are genetically modified to express this a-syn-GFP fusion protein, and demonstrate single-chain antibody reduction of a-syn-GFP accumulation in vivo. 15 In AD, clinical trials that exploited active and passive vaccination have focused on full-length amyloid-b (Ab) 1-40 and Ab1-42, but early results were not sufficiently positive to justify product development, although some early-stage trials are continuing. Charles G. Glabe (UC Irvine) will discuss his investigations of the structural differences between different forms of Ab protein aggregates. 16 Understanding these species is shown to be essential, so that precise forms of soluble and insoluble Ab can be effectively targeted with specific antibodies during the progression of AD and offer important opportunities for AD therapy. 17 Cynthia A. Lemere (Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School) will describe her research on a candidate target in the Ab plaque, pyroglutamate-3 Ab (pyroGlu3 Ab), which now appears to be a major contributor to plaque formation and aggregate toxicity. PyroGlu3 Ab is formed by Nterminal truncation of the first two amino acids of Ab followed by cyclization of Glu-3 by glutaminyl cyclase, resulting in a hydrophobic and degradation-resistant, pathogenic form of amyloid. 18 The Lemere group was one of the earliest to explore the use of pGlu-3 Ab as an immunotherapeutic target. She will present evidence from their recent investigations that reinforce the potential that passive immunization against pGlu-3 Ab may offer important avenues for AD prevention and therapy. She and her colleagues at Harvard Medical School have recently described striking results that implicate microglia and complement in early synapse loss in aging and AD. 19, 20 Tim West (C2N Diagnostics) will discuss the development of their humanized antibody, 8E12, that recognizes an aggregated, extracellular form of tau thought to be responsible for pathogenic tau \"seeding\" between nerve cells in neurodegenerative diseases, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and AD. Tau is an intracellular microtubule-associated protein that, when phosphorylated, forms aggregates that appear to spread from neuron to neuron and eventually result in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles within the brain. Immunotherapy with 8E12 does not require uptake of the antibody by neurons, and therefore, represents a novel and potentially critical approach in the suppression of tau pathology in tauopathies. The C2N anti-tau antibody 8E12 program is now being supported by AbbVie and trials are underway for the treatment of PSP.",

Early clinical development in healthy volunteers and multiple sclerosis patients is currently underway. A major challenge for biologics that specifically target neurodegenerative diseases is the requirement to cross the blood brain barrier in order to gain effective entry into the central nervous system to engage the target. Uli Brinkmann (Roche) will describe specific antibodies for targeted delivery to, into and across cells and tissues including new trans-blood-brainbarrier delivery approaches with release functionality. The next two talks will cover different approaches for potential treatment of other types of degenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease and ischemic heart disease.

Data will be presented showing that certain protein domains were successfully targeted and provided mutant HTT lowering in plasma and organs combined with phenotypic benefit. Ke Cheng (UNC-Chapel Hill) set out to specifically target circulating stem cells to engage with injured cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells in ischemic tissue using bispecific antibodies.

Theoretical and practical considerations would suggest that functional libraries should provide specific binders at the rate of approximately one binder per ten million clones. However, as libraries have grown exponentially larger, the number of isolated/identified binders has not increased correspondingly. By comparing the diversity of binders obtained from the same original na\u20ac \u0131ve antibody genetic material screened by: 1) phage display; 2) phage combined with yeast display; and 3) phage/yeast display with next-generation sequencing, this talk will illustrate how the diversity of isolated binders depends upon the screening/selection methods used. An alternative approach to traditional display technologies is the use of two hybrid methods, such as yeast two hybrid. Antonino Cattaneo (Scuola Normale Superiore) will describe the further development of this technology to select antibodies recognizing specific targets, particularly how it can be applied to the selection of antibodies against specific post-translational modifications (PTMs). This involves the anchored in vivo site-specific modification of a specific target, followed by the in vivo (yeast) selection of antibodies recognizing that modification. The selection of functional antibodies against acetylated and conformational targets will be described. One important advantage of this technique is that selected antibodies are functional within the cytoplasm. As a result, in addition to being able to inhibit PTM activity, selected antibodies tend to be particularly stable.",

            "text": "Finally, John McCafferty (IONTAS) will describe the creation of new antibody forms able to recognize inherently difficult targets. These are based on small biologically active cysteine-rich peptides that have been identified in a variety of plants and toxins. By inserting such cysteine-rich peptides into an antibody complementarity-determining region, the function of the peptide can be conferred upon the antibody, while simultaneously improving half-life and manufacturability. X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays confirm that both peptide and antibody are correctly folded and active. This approach has been used to generate antibodies able to block ion channels, targets that are traditionally difficult to inhibit with traditional antibody selection methods. Exploiting the exquisite specificity of antibodies for the redirection of (polyclonal) T cells for (tumor) cell killing is the theme of the two sessions on \"Engineering Antibodies for T cell Therapy.\" The sessions will explore innovative approaches in this exciting antibody engineering field, from fundamental explorations to clinical stage. The morning talks will address the latest developments with the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) approach, where T cells are typically redirected by ex vivo engineering to express an antibody binding domain fused to an activation moiety. The afternoon session will be centered on bispecific antibody approaches redirecting T cells to engage them in target cell killing. The sessions are designed to be complementary and to generate lively discussions that will stimulate new lines of thinking.",

Encouraging data will be presented with a CD30 specific CAR-T that effectively eliminates CD30C lymphoma cells, but does not attack CD30 positive hematopoietic stems or progenitor cells. Next, Wayne Marasco (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School) will present exciting results with antibody-secreting CAR-T cells that manipulate the tumor microenvironment to increase tumor cell killing efficacy. This ground-breaking approach could address some of the challenges of solid tumor targeting by CAR-T cells. Dimiter Dimitrov (National Institutes of Health) will then explore the many antibody engineering questions surrounding the CAR format. The interrelationships between epitope location, antibody affinity/avidity and efficacy will be brought into perspective and into relation to several antibody formats, including CAR-T.",

The exciting utility of synNotch receptors to sense diverse environmental antigens and drive localized, rationally designed response programs in T lymphocytes will be illustrated. Next, Kate Mac-Donald (The Centre for Drug Research and Development) will explore a now role for CAR-T cells in treatment of graft-versushost disease (GVHD). Data will be presented on allo-antigen CAR-Tregs, including a comparison of CAR-Tregs v. polyclonal Tregs in in vitro and in vivo efficacy of GVHD prevention. In the final talk, David Gilham (Celyad S.A.) will introduce the topic of exploiting natural killer cell receptors for the development of CAR approaches. NK-CAR-T cells facilitate the interaction with multiple tumor antigens, potentially reducing the likelihood of antigennegative tumor escape variants. Furthermore, pre-clinical models with this innovative and exiting new approach suggest that preconditioning is not required for therapeutic efficacy. The afternoon session opens with a comparison of the two major topics covered in this daylong session on engineering antibodies for T-cell therapies. Bent Jakobsen (Immunocore Ltd and AdaptImmune Ltd) will show the applicability of Tcell receptors (TCRs) as binding domains for both CD3directed bispecific and adoptive T cell therapies. He will compare and discuss both therapeutic approaches, focusing on the differences of both approaches with regards to optimization of TCRs and the biological effects. Blinatumomab, a fragmentbased bispecific CD19xCD3 antibody, validated the power of CD3 bispecifics: engaging T cells in B cell malignant cell killing. However, a fragment-based approach leads to short half-life and a need for frequent dosing. Recent progress in the field of bispecific technologies enables the development of full-length (i.e., regular antibody architecture) bispecific antibodies for Tcell recruitment approaches. A frontrunner full-length bispecific antibody program is being presented by Eric Smith (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals). He will discuss the advantages of their human full-length CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody. Next, another full length bispecific antibody product will be discussed by Francois Gaudet (Janssen). In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data of this CD123xCD3 bispecific antibody, currently in Phase 1 clinical study for acute myeloid leukemia, will be shared and discussed.

Yvonne Chen (University of California, Los Angeles) will demonstrate the power of such a bispecific CAR-T. Although so far this session has focused on T-cell therapies for cancer, T cells could of course also be used to kill infectious disease targets. Guido Ferrari (Duke University Medical Center) will discuss exciting advantages of using a bispecific T-cell recruiting antibody for killing latently HIV-1 infected CD4C T cells. The last speaker of this session, Mark Cobbold (Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center), will present a novel approach where T cells are engaged for tumor cell killing.
