            "text": "This study uses panel regression tests to examine the response of hotel performance to international tourism development and crisis events in Taiwan. Hotel performance measures are revenue (revenue per available room and occupancy rate), profitability (return on assets and return on equity) and stock performance. The crises were the earthquake on September 21, 1999 (the 9/21 earthquake), the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the US (the 9/11 terrorist attacks) and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on April 22, 2003 (the SARS outbreak). This study makes four major contributions. First, test results confirm that international tourism development (ITD), proxied by the growth of total inbound tourist arrivals, has a more direct influence on hotel sales and profitability than it does on hotel stock performance. Second, this study identifies that the absence of a strong tie between ITD and hotel stock returns that was found in previous studies is due to the time-varying discount rate caused by investors' changing expectations for the prospect of future cash flows from holding hotel stocks. Third, this study finds new evidence that while the poor performance of hotel stocks caused by the 9/21 earthquake and the 9/11 terrorist attacks was attributed to the loss of hotel sales revenue, the adverse effect of the SARS outbreak on hotel stock returns is attributed not only to decreased hotel sales revenue but also to the increased discount rate. Lastly, this study is the first to investigate whether the response of hotel stock returns to ITD depends on the state of economy and concludes that the response of hotel stock performance to ITD in business cycle contraction is statistically different from that in business cycle expansion. Further, although the influence of ITD on hotel stock performance is still irrelevant during expansion periods, ITD can significantly enhance hotel stock returns during contraction periods.",

The damage to inbound tourism development caused by the earthquake on September 21, 1999 (the 9/21 earthquake), the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the US (the 9/11 terrorist attacks) and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on April 22, 2003 (the SARS outbreak) through a sharp drop in the foreign visitors to Taiwan is expected to weaken the sales/earnings and financial performance of Taiwanese hotel companies. Empirical studies have confirmed this expectation. Chen et al. (2005) showed that the 9/21 earthquake, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the SARS outbreak significantly hurt Taiwanese hotel stock returns. The authors associated the negative impact of three crisis events on hotel stock performance with the decrease in the number of international tourists and thus in hotel sales earnings. This study argues that the plunge in foreign tourist arrivals caused by the three crises not only weakened hotel revenue, but also increased the perceived risk of investments in hotel stocks. Therefore, investors' perceived riskiness of cash flows from holding hotel stocks soared and led to an upward revision in the discount rate after the three crisis events. This study hypothesizes that the destructive effect of the three crisis events on hotel stock returns could be attributed both to decreased hotel sales earnings and to the increased discount rate (Hypothesis III). Similar to the test of Hypothesis II, whether these three crisis events have a significant influence on risk of hotel stock returns is examined to test the third hypothesis.",

As stated earlier, a time-varying discount rate caused by investors' changing perceptions about the riskiness of cash flows can still break the link between hotel stock performance and inbound tourism expansion. Nonetheless, as hotel sales revenue deteriorates in economic downturns, the growing inflow of foreign tourist arrivals is very good news during business cycle contraction. The good news from inbound tourism market may have a relatively stronger influence on investors' perceptions about the riskiness of cash flows holding hotel stocks in business contraction than in business expansion. Thus, while inbound tourism growth cannot significantly affect hotel stock performance as found in previous studies, it may have a strong impact on hotel stock returns during business contraction.",

Further, some perishable goods, due to insufficient export capability and global marketing expertise, can only be sold to foreign tourists in the domestic market.

Chinese hotel stock returns were found to be more sensitive to general economic state variables (monetary policy factors and industrial production growth) and non-economic events (the SARS outbreak and political issues).

Indeed, the discount rate used by stock investors reflects investors' perceived riskiness of stock cash flows from holding stocks. If investors alter their perceptions of the riskiness of a given stock's cash flows, it can cause a changing instead of constant discount rate. Thus, while inbound tourism growth is expected to have a direct influence on hotel sales, it may not significantly affect the discount rate used to discount hotel stock's cash flows, which still can break down the connection between hotel stock performance and inbound tourism expansion.",

Drakos (2004) evaluated the influence of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US on airline stocks listed on different international stock markets. The author illustrated that the risk of airline stocks has soared since September 11, 2001. By using the market model as the relevant return-generating mechanism and event study methodology to determine whether there is a significant change in risk of airline stock returns, he detected a structural break in risk of airline stock returns since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US. He asserted that the increased risk of airline stock returns reflected increased uncertainty surrounding the airline industry. Kim and Gu (2002) examined the impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on return and risk of both US and non-US airline stocks traded on US stock markets, including New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX) and National Association of Securities and Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ). The authors tested whether returns and risk of airline stocks were significantly different before and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Test results revealed that risk of airline stock returns increased significantly after the event, but mean returns of airline stocks remained much the same.",

On the contrary, the coefficient b 12 , representing the impact of inbound tourism growth on HSR during business cycle contraction, is 0.3693 and statistically significant at the 1% level. In other words, while tourism expansion has no substantial impact on hotel stock return during business cycle expansion, a 1% increase in tourism expansion can significantly causes a 0.3693% increase in HSR during business cycle contraction. The response of HSR to tourism expansion in contraction is about 9 times the size of the response in expansion. The difference between b 11 and b 12 is 0.3293 and statistically significant at the 1% level. The difference between regression coefficients is still statistically significant at the 5% level when the regression test equation includes dummy variables. Table 7 depicts the test results of asymmetric impact of inbound tourism development on hotel revenue measures. The coefficient b 21 is 0.0016 and statistically significant at the 1% level, implying that 1% increase in tourism expansion during business expansion leads to a 0.0016% increase in hotel occupancy rate (see panel A). The coefficient b 22 is 0.0024 and statistically significant at the 1% level, suggesting that hotel occupancy rate rises by 0.0024% in response to 1% growth in inbound tourism market during business contraction. The response of hotel occupancy to tourism expansion in contraction is 1.5 times the size of the response in expansion. However, the difference between regression coefficients, representing the response of hotel occupancy in contraction and expansion, is not statistically significant. Similar results are found when regression test equation includes dummy variables (see panel B).",

For tourism authorities and hotel business managers, the findings do not only demonstrate the substantial influence of international tourism development on hotel performance, but also suggest that hotel revenue and profitability in Taiwan could suffer during downturns of the tourism industry or low demand for tourism.

To enhance the impact of tourism expansion or ameliorate the adverse impact during downturns of the inbound tourism market, Taiwanese tourism authorities and policymakers on the one hand must set priority for allocating limited resources to international tourism development when implementing other strategic tourism plans. On the other hand, they can apply the practical findings in Jang and Chen (2008) as guidelines for diversification or risk management in the Taiwanese tourism market. Jang and Chen (2008) examined how Taiwan can obtain optimal foreign tourist market mixes by minimizing variability in foreign tourist arrivals based on the financial portfolio theory. They showed that to achieve the goal of the DTAP, the Taiwanese government should shift available resources to Japan to achieve a maximum growth of inbound tourism growth.",

This crisis management can help sustain the confidence level of safety and security of travelers by reducing the uncertainty in the tourism market and hence avoid a decline in foreign tourist arrivals during crisis period. Further, as Rittichainuwat and Chakraborty (2009) noted, although marketers believe that price is a critical factor in destination recovery, this may not be always true. Hotel business managers need to know that low-cost tour packages did not motivate tourists to visit the affected destination (Rittichainuwat, 2006) . Rittichainuwat and Chakraborty (2009) stated that discounting may create a negative image of low-cost travel destinations and it could be hard to alter the negative image after the destination has fully recovered.

In consequence, inbound tourism expansion is expected to have both direct and indirect effects on hotel performance in those countries. Similarly, the hotel industry in China and Hong Kong was significantly hurt by the SARS outbreak. It is worth examining whether test results based on data from those countries would be similar to the empirical findings in this study. Moreover, Oh (2005) showed that international tourism development in South Korea could not cause significant economic growth. However, Chen and Chiou-Wei (2009) supported the tourism-led growth hypothesis in South Korea.
