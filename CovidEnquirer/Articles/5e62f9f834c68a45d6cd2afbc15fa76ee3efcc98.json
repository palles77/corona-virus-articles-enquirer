It is able to resist the low pH of the gastric juices, reaches the small intestine and destroys the villous enterocytes causing atrophy of the villi. The resulting acute malabsorption syndrome is the consequence of a reduced enzymatic activity and cellular transport of nutrients and electrolytes of the damaged villous enterocytes. The replacement of villous epithelium in the small intestine is markedly accelerated in animals of 3 weeks and older compared to newborn pigs. The young villous cells produce less virus resulting in an age-dependent resistance to TGE [8] . Furthermore, an impaired lymphocyte cytotoxicity was found in newborn piglets and was accounted for the high susceptibility to TGEV during the first weeks of life [9] .",

As on premises with enzootic infections almost all cows possess antibodies, a booster reaction occurs after parenteral vaccination resulting in a more effective and longerlasting lactogenic immunity. The route and time of immunization, the adjuvant used and the viral dose and form (live or inactivated) are of remarkable influence (reviewed in Ref. [41] ). Some authors demonstrated significantly enhanced antibody-titres in mammary secretions of intramuscularly vaccinated cows, whilst other authors did not (see Ref. [42] ). In our investigations significant increases were not found either, although remarkable protective effects were shown by clinical and virological parameters [42] .

[51] ), the most frequent route of infection is probably the oral ingestion, followed by virus replication in the intestinal epithelium. Whereas FECV strains do not spread wider than into the lymph nodes, FIP-causing virus strains have a tropism for phagocytic cells. They replicate in macrophages and are disseminated by them. Pedersen [51] assumed that not only the properties of the infecting virus strain were responsible for the outcome of the disease, but that also the immunologic situation of the host and the type and degree of developing immunity may be of great importance. While humoral antibodies were shown to enhance the development of clinical disease (see Ref. [51] ), immunity to FIP seems to be cell-mediated. Pedersen [51] proposed a scheme for the pathogenesis of FIP: a strong humoral, but lacking cellular immunity is assumed to be responsible for development of effusive FIP. Strong humoral and weak cellular immunity may lead to noneffusive FIP. A strong cellular immunity, however, may inhibit the development of disease. Weiss and Cox [54] demonstrated delayed-type hypersensitivity-like reactions to FIPV in the skin of cats which had remained asymptomatic after a previous challenge-exposure with FIPV. The assumption is supported by the fact that cats having recovered from FIPV infections and harboring the virus in a latent form often develop clinical FIP after a coinfection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV), that mainly depresses the cellular immunity. In general a high percentage of cats with naturally occurring FIP is coinfected with FeLV.",
