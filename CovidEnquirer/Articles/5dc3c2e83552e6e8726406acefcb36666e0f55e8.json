Coupling occurred mostly at the 2-ONN ring nitrogen to give the aimed targets, and in a few cases, it happened at the 2-oxo position giving O-alkylation products. Free 2-ONNs and their acetylated nucleosides were tested against a number of viruses. The nucleoside analogue 2a Ac showed good anti SARS-CoV and anti influenza A (H 5 N 1 ) activities.

The constant search for new drugs to be used alone or in combination with existing market drugs has become a necessity. In continuation of our efforts in finding such drug candidates, we have focused on the investigation of 2-oxonicotinonitrile (2-ONN) derivatives containing two aryl groups at the four-and six-positions of the ring. The 2-ONN ring contains the biologically important, naturally occurring 2-pyridinone motif [1, 2] . This motif has been found in compounds that are human immune deficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [3e5], anti-herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) agents [6] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase inhibitors [7] , and anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) agents [8] . In addition to their antiviral activity, 2-pyridinone derivatives are known to possess activity against wild type [9, 10] and resistant [11] bacterial strains. The derivatives have also been shown to be antifungal [12] and antiprotozoal agents [13, 14] .",

The 2-ONN ring was attached to 2-pyridyl (Py) and p-chlorophenyl (PhCl) groups in 1a, to 2-thienyl (Th) and 4-isopropylphenyl (PhPr) groups in 1b, and to two Th groups in 1c. Compounds 1a [18] and 1c [19] were reported to be prepared through their respective chalcones in two steps from the aldehyde and ketone. However, the one-pot method that we adapted afforded a shorter route for their synthesis. Compounds 1aec were obtained as the amido tautomer as suggested by the presence of bands in the IR spectrum characteristic for NH and C]O of the amide functional group. This was also emphasized by the presence of an 1 H NMR peak at a chemical shift higher than 12 ppm, corresponding to the amide NH. Obtaining the amido tautomer rather than the imido was explained by a recent study showing that the amido tautomer was more stable and hence predominant [20] .",

In all other cases coupling occurred mainly at the ring N atom. In fact, these results were in contrast to the ones we observed in our previous work [21, 22] , where we have examined the coupling of the 2-ONN derivative 1d ( Fig. 2 ) with 10 different glycosyl and substituted alkyl halides under the same reaction conditions. In all cases, alkylation occurred at the 2-oxo position of the 2-ONN ring of 1d and the corresponding O-glycosylation and O-alkylation products were separated in yields ranging from 48% to 87%. Compounds 1aec differ from 1d by changing one of the aryl groups attached to the 2-ONN ring, while retaining the other one. Other published work showed that a very close 2-ONN structure (1e, Fig. 2 ) is also glycosylated at the 2-oxo position under the same conditions [23] . Furthermore, the similar 2-ONN compound 1f (Fig. 2) was also reported to couple with ethyl bromoacetate at the 2-oxo position under similar reaction condition to the one used in our work [24] .",

Keeping these contradicting results in mind, one can envision that regioselectivity of the reaction depends on the size of both the coupling agent and the substituents on the 2-ONN ring. Additionally, the type and relative positions of the aryl substituents on the ring induce an electronic effect that contributes to the relative electron density at the ring N and 2-oxo positions, which in turn controls the regioselectivity. It is to be noted that careful chromatographic separation of products of such reactions show that both Nand Oglycosylation/alkylation can occur, with one of them as the major product [26] .",

Zone of inhibition screening tests based on well diffusion method were used to examine both the antibacterial and antifungal activities. Table 2 shows the diameter of inhibition zone in mm for the 2-ONN compounds against the selected bacteria and fungi. The results were compared to Ampicillin as a reference antibacterial drug and Dermatin as a reference antifungal drug to evaluate the potency of the tested compounds. This antimicrobial study was conducted for both the final deprotected form and O-acetylated form of the 2-ONN derivatives. As mentioned above, O-acetylated forms were originally obtained as synthetic intermediates. The latter were more lipophilic and could have different biological properties than the deacetylated counterparts. Derivatives in Table 2 that were variants of 2-ONN compounds from Table 1 by acetyl protection were denoted by the addition of Ac to the number of each compound. Since the tested samples were prepared as N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) solutions, wells containing only the microorganism and DMF were used as a negative control. DMF resulted in no inhibition zone. Among the tested compounds, 7b showed the highest antibacterial activity (23 mm) against B. subtilis, which was even higher than the standard drug Ampicillin (20 mm). However, it had no activity against the Gram negative bacteria E. coli. In fact, all the tested compounds except 3b showed no activity against E. coli. 3b had small antibacterial activity of 5 mm compared to that of Ampicillin (18 mm). Compounds 2b and 7c Ac showed moderate antibacterial activity against B. subtilis. Compounds 2b Ac , 2c Ac , 3a Ac , 3b Ac , 2c, 3a, 3b, 3c, 5 Ac , 5, 8a and 9 showed lower antibacterial activity against Gram positive bacteria compared to Ampicillin. These data proved that there was no obvious trend suggesting that increasing lipophilicity by addition of acetyl groups in the 2-ONN structure had an effect on the antibacterial activity. Antifungal zone of inhibition studies showed that all the tested compounds had moderate antifungal activity against Asperigillus niger and Asperigillus virdi-nutans compared to the standard drug Dermatin.",
