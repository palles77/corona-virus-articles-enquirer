The effects of various factors such as extraction solvent, solvent concentration, temperature, solvent to solid ratio, ultrasound power, extraction time and particle size on the yield of target components were investigated. The optimal UAE conditions found were: 70% (v/v) methanol solution, temperature 45 \u2022 C, solvent to solid ratio 15 ml/g, ultrasound power 150 W, extraction time 45 min and particle size 60-80 mesh. The results indicated that compared with ME at 18 h and SE at 6 h, UAE gave the highest extraction yields of tectoridin, iristectorin B, iristectorin A, tectorigenin, iristectorigenin A and total isoflavones at 45 min. The results indicated that UAE was an alternative method for extracting isoflavones from I. tectorum.",

It is obvious that medical interest in plants derived drugs has led to an increased need for ideal extraction methods, which could obtain the maximum of the bioactive constituents in a shortest processing time with a low cost. The conventional extraction methods, such as maceration extraction (ME) and soxhlet extraction (SE), which have been employed for decades, need long extraction times and require relatively large quantities of solvent. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) has been proved to possess abilities of significantly decreasing extraction time and increasing extraction yields in many natural products [13] [14] [15] . So far, UAE has been widely applied to extract active compounds such as flavonoids [16, 17] , alkaloids [18] , steroids [19] and anthraquinones [20, 21] from plant materials. The aim of the present paper reported is to evaluate the influence of main extraction conditions including extraction solvent, solvent concentration, temperature, solvent to solid ratio, ultrasound power, extraction time and particle size on the yield of five isoflavones from I. tectorum.",

The results illustrated in Fig. 3 showed that the highest extraction yields of T, ITB, ITA, TN, INA and TIF were obtained at 70% methanol.

Fig. 4 showed the extraction yields of the five isoflavonoids increased with the increase of extraction temperature. The extraction yields of T, ITB, ITA, TN and INA at 45 \u2022 C were 33.12, 3.34, 5.44, 13.59 and 3.31 mg/g, respectively. But the increasing extraction temperature from 45 to 65 \u2022 C, the extraction yields of the dominant components T and TN, TIF in the herb, were not significant (p > 0.05). The results are probably because that high temperature can increase the solubility and mass transfer rate of target compounds, which was favorable to extraction. However, some degradation processes may occur at high temperature, and then lower recoveries can be obtained. Finally, 45 \u2022 C was used as the extraction temperature. Fig. 4 .
