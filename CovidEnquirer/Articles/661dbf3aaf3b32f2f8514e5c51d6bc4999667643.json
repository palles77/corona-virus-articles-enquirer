PED was first recognized in the United Kingdom and Belgium in the 1970s (Wood, 1977) , and sporadically or endemically appeared in Europe and Asia before 2010 (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994) . In late 2010, a large-scale outbreak of PED, which was caused by a highly virulent PED virus (PEDV) variant (GII genogroup), occurred in China (Li et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2016) . In April 2013, the Chinese-like PEDV variant also emerged in the United States and rapidly spread across the country (Stevenson et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014) . Currently, PEDV has been reported in many countries and causes high economic losses (Jung and Saif, 2015; Lee, 2015; Song et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019; Zhang and Yoo, 2016) .",

The two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, occupy almost two-thirds of the genome, encoding two large replicase proteins, pp1a and pp1b, which are post-translationally cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), nsp1-nsp16. The remaining ORFs, ORF2-6, encode spike (S) protein, envelop (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and one accessory protein, ORF3 (Duarte et al., 1993) .",

In 2013, Li et al. first reported a reverse genetics system for the Korean classical PEDV vaccine strain DR13 based on a targeted RNA recombination method (Li et al., 2013) . Following this, Jengarn et al. engineered an infectious cDNA clone of the Thailand classical PEDV strain AVCT12 into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) using eight contiguous cDNA fragments (Jengarn et al., 2015) . In 2016, Beall et al. constructed infectious cDNA clones of a highly pathogenic US PEDV strain PC22A using in vitro ligation of contiguous cDNA fragments, and performed in vitro transcription to generate infectious viral RNA (Beall et al., 2016) . Using a similar strategy, Fan et al. developed an infectious cDNA clone for a Chinese PEDV variant strain, AH2012/12 (Fan et al., 2017) . Li et al. developed a reverse genetics system for two Chinese PEDV strains with differing virulence by ligation of cDNA fragments into BACs one by one . Using established reverse genetics systems, the functions of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2019.113772 Received 12 March 2019; Received in revised form 6 November 2019; Accepted 7 November 2019 some PEDV proteins, such as S protein and ORF3, in modulating PEDV pathogenicity have been examined (Beall et al., 2016; Hou et al., 2017 Hou et al., , 2019 Kaewborisuth et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) . Several recombinant PEDV vaccine candidates have also been generated using reverse genetics systems (Hou et al., 2019; Kao et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) . Although infectious clone systems for PEDV using various strategies (Teeravechyan et al., 2016) have become established, approaches to generate a new mutant PEDVs with defined genetic changes using infectious clones remains a tedious process, usually requiring constructing and ligating a set of contiguous cDNA fragments. A simple and rapid method for manipulation of the full-length infectious clone is desirable.",

An enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene was designed to replace the ORF3 gene. To this end, two sgRNAs (sgRNA-\u0394ORF3a and sgRNA-\u0394ORF3b) targeting the upstream and downstream sequences of the ORF3 gene, respectively, were synthesized. Each sgRNA contained a cleavage site which was located at three nucleotides upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (Fig. 3A) . The sgRNAs were generated by T7 in vitro transcription of templates amplified with primers of sgRNA-ORF3a/b and scaffold oligo (Table 1) by overlapping PCR (Fig. 3B) . To cleave the BAC plasmid pBAC-AJ1102, a mixture containing S. pyogenes Cas9 protein (1 \u03bcM), sgRNA-\u0394ORF3a and sgRNA-\u0394ORF3b (300 nM), pBAC-AJ1102 (5 \u03bcg) and the Cas9 nuclease buffer (1\u00d7) was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2.5 h. As shown in Fig. 3C , pBAC-AJ1102 was cleaved at the designed sites, producing a linearized BAC (34.1 kb) and a 2.2 kb fragment containing ORF3 gene, E gene and partial sequences of S gene and M gene. At the same time, a 2.3 kb fragment containing the cDNA of EGFP, E gene, partial sequences of S gene and M gene, and a 20 bp homologous arm at both terminals (homologous arm 5'-AGAGGCTATTAGTCAAACTT-3' at 5' terminal, homologous arm 5'-AACTGGGTCTTTTTTGCTTT-3' at 3' terminal), was generated by fusion PCR with primers listed in Table 1 . Then the linearized BAC fragment was purified and ligated with the 2.3 kb fragment by homologous recombination (Fig. 3A) . After transformation of DH10B competent cells, the recombinant BAC plasmid, pBAC-AJ1102-\u0394ORF3-EGFP, was obtained. Sequence analysis confirmed that the ORF3 gene was successfully replaced by the EGFP gene (Fig. 3D ). To evaluate the success rate and reproducibility of this method, three independent experiments were performed. For each experiment, ca. 20 clones were picked. The percentage of positive clones in three independent experiments was 47% (8/17), 38% (8/21), and 47.8% (11/ 23), respectively, and the mean positive rate was 44%, demonstrating that this method is an efficient technology for manipulation of the fulllength infectious clone of PEDV genome.",

As shown in Fig. 4C , all three viruses expressed N protein, while only rAJ1102-\u0394ORF3-EGFP-infected cells expressed EGFP, which further confirmed that EGFP was successfully inserted into the PEDV genome.",

For example, Wang et al. used the Cas9/sgRNA complex to cut a 22 kb plasmid, and then a 783 bp DNA fragment was inserted into the linearized plasmid seamlessly through Gibson assembly to select 4 clones which were all positive (Wang et al., 2015) . Jiang et al. used RNA-guided Cas9 to cut bacterial chromosomes Q. Peng, et al. Journal of Virological Methods 276 (2020) 113772 and the cleaved target genome segment was ligated to a PCR amplified vector backbone through Gibson assembly (Jiang et al., 2015) . The cloning efficiency ranged from 21.5%-65.8% (21.5% for 100 kb and 65.8% for 50 kb fragment) (Jiang et al., 2015) . In the present study, CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease cleavage was combined with the in-fusion clone method to edit the viral genome in vitro using the infectious clone of PEDV as a model. Three independent experiments showed that the recombinant efficiency is 38%-47.8%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this approach has been used to manipulate an infectious clone of RNA virus by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Relative to previous strategies used to manipulate infectious clones of large RNA viruses by constructing and ligating a set of contiguous cDNA fragments, this method has demonstrable advantages in improving the quality and efficiency of constructing recombinant RNA viruses. First, two sgRNAs targeting the genes or regions of interest can be easily designed and generated using a T7 in vitro transcription kit. Second, cleavage of the target genes or regions can be completed within 3 h in a simple nuclease buffer system containing BAC plasmid, Cas9 nuclease, and sgRNAs. Third, the cleaved BAC plasmids can be easily ligated with a DNA fragment with a 20 bp homologous arm using an infusion clone kit to obtain the desired BAC plasmid containing the mutation, insertion or deletion of interest. In our experience, the whole process from sgRNA generation, BAC plasmid cleavage, homologous recombination, transformation, BAC plasmid extraction, transfection and final recovery of recombinant virus, could be completed within one week. Most importantly, a DNA template library with different mutations can be prepared to construct numerous recombinant PEDVs simultaneously. In other words, a high throughput method to construct recombinant viruses can be developed. This will dramatically reduce the time and cost for manipulation of the PEDV genome. Q. Peng, et al. Journal of Virological Methods 276 (2020) 113772 In addition to the obtained rAJ1102-\u0394ORF3-EGFP, the CRISPR/ Cas9 technique was used to construct another recombinant PEDV, in which a continuous 12-nt motif was successfully inserted into the Cterminal of the S gene of PEDV strain AJ1102 (F12) (data not shown), further demonstrating that CRISPR/Cas9 is a more efficient technology for manipulation of the PEDV genome. Furthermore, this strategy was also used to edit the full-length infectious clones of other RNA viruses with larger genomes, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), another swine enteric coronavirus, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the family Arteriviridae (unpublished data). Collectively, this study has established a more efficient platform for PEDV genome manipulation, and the method described in this study is also applicable to other RNA viruses.",

Consistent with previous studies, the rescued rAJ1102-\u0394ORF3-EGFP possessed similar proliferation properties in vitro compared with the wildtype AJ1102 virus. The insertion of reporter genes such as EGFP will be very useful for the study of various molecular and virological aspects of PEDV infection in vitro and in vivo. For example, rAJ1102-\u0394ORF3-EGFP can be exploited to establish convenient virus neutralization assays that provide answers within hours rather than days, and this reporter PEDV can also be used to investigate the transportation dynamics of PEDV in intestinal tract of piglets in vivo.",
