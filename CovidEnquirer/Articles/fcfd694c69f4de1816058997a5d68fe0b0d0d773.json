In the 1960s, an attempt to vaccinate children with a formalininactivated HRSV vaccine failed when enhanced disease was reported after subsequent HRSV infection of vaccinated infants. 3, 4 A vaccine against HRSV is not currently available and a major obstacle for development of a vaccine is that the immunological mechanisms leading to either protection or enhanced disease has not been clarified. It seems that part of the illness caused by natural HRSV infection is because of the host immune response. 5, 6 For some years RSV serum antibodies were thought to play a role in the enhanced disease, 7 but passive antibody prophylaxis has shown that antibodies cause an acceleration of virus clearance without harmful effects 8, 9 although there was no improvement in the pulmonary pathology either. 10 A systemic cell-mediated sensitization has also been suggested to contribute to the altered response to natural HRSV infection that occurred after use of inactivated HRSV vaccine. 11 In this context the mouse model has been used intensively to study the association between T-cell subpopulations and immunemediated disease. 12 However, most of this work has focused on the vaccine-enhanced disease whereas there is a lack of investigation into the pathogenesis of the primary infection. A better understanding of the pathogenesis after primary infection will probably help in solving the conundrum of the vaccine-enhanced disease.",

They were monitored weekly for IgM and IgG 1 antibodies to BRSV as described 14 and they were free of clinical signs of respiratory tract disease at the time of inoculation. None of the calves experienced BRSV infection before inoculation. The calves were inoculated at the age of \u03f33 months. A total of 32 calves were included in this study of which 24 were inoculated with BRSV and 8 were mock-inoculated. The inoculation was divided into four experiments (experiments IV, IX, XI, and XIV) and in each experiment all of the calves were inoculated on the same day. Inoculum were either lung wash fluid from a calf infected experimentally with a field isolate of BRSV (used for experiment IV) or cell culture material of BRSV-infected fetal bovine lung cells (used for experiments IX, XI, and XIV) as described. 15, 16 Lung wash fluid from an uninfected calf served as mock inoculum in experiment IV, whereas uninfected cell culture of fetal bovine lung cells was used as mock inoculum for the remainder. 16 The calves were only inoculated once by combined intratracheal and aerosol route. A dose of 10 4.6 (experiment IV) to 10 5.2 (experiment IX) tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) diluted to 5 ml in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) was administered throughout 10 minutes through a mask covering nostrils and mouth (Waechtomat inhalator VM 82, Kruse, Denmark, most droplets less than 3 m). Subsequently, a dose of 10 4.6 to 10 5.2 TCID 50 diluted to 20 ml in PBS was injected into the trachea. All calves were housed together until the time of inoculation then the control calves were moved to separate, but similar isolation units. To investigate the influence of other agents, three calves in experiment XI were treated daily with 2.5 mg/kg of enrofloxacin (Baytril, Bayer) from 1 day before inoculation until the calves were killed on postinoculation day (PID) 6.",

To generate the score for the number of BRSV-positive cells, the whole section from the eight standardized areas of the lungs was evaluated. Three sections with different scores were used as internal control and were included in every batch of immunohistochemistry. The number of positive cells in the sections was estimated according to these three sections. The sections were \u03f31 by 2 cm and although they were not exactly the same size, the average of eight sections equalized the difference.",

In general, CD68-positive mature macrophages were only rarely detected in the bronchial epithelium during the infection. The number of phagocytizing cells and their morphology suggest that the phagocytizing cells were neighboring epithelial cells, but immunostaining with anti-cytokeratin to demonstrate epithelial origin was difficult because of the intense staining of neighboring epithelial cells. Later, on PID 8, many of the alveolar cells were demonstrated to be apoptotic, several of which were phagocytized by other cells. The identity of these alveolar phagocytizing cells are uncertain.

At PID 2 only a few bronchial epithelial cells were positive for BRSV replication and antigen, whereas there was a high number of positive bronchial epithelial cells on PID 4. The inoculum should in theory reach the alveoli by aerosol inoculation because most droplets were less than 3 m. It is possible that the eclipse phase seen in the upper respiratory tract was longer in the lower respiratory tract explaining the delayed onset of replication in the lower respiratory tract. However, it is more likely that the major part of the inoc- ulum stuck to the mucus layer of the upper respiratory tract without reaching the alveoli. At the time of extensive viral replication in the bronchial epithelium, the infection then spread downwards to the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium, maybe as a result of the cilia destruction of the bronchial epithelium. The replication of BRSV was pronounced in the luminal part of the epithelium as also described for HRSV and naturally BRSV-infected calves. 20, 23 Large amounts of BRSV antigen were demonstrated in the cilia of bronchial epithelial cells on PID 4, which led to cilia destruction as described before by electron microscopic examination. 24 The severe clinical signs with tachypnea and anorexia were not manifested until PID 6, which coincided with maximum replication in the alveolar epithelial cells. Calves with replication restricted to the upper respiratory tract, including the bronchial epithelial cells, were coughing but demonstrated no severe clinical signs. This clinical progression of illness from an upper respiratory tract infection to a lower respiratory tract infection has also been described in young children with HRSV infection 1 and in immunocompromised human adults. 25, 26 Here we demonstrate a correlation between the progression of clinical signs and viral replication, which may explain why monthly administration of RSV antibodies to high-risk children seems to be effective in reducing the numbers of severe respiratory disease in young children. 27 The presence of high levels of antibodies might prevent a spread of viral replication to the lower part of the respiratory tract thereby preventing severe disease.",

Similar to our studies, analysis of cells obtained by bronchial lavage of infants with HRSV infection demonstrated excessive numbers of neutrophils in both the upper and lower airway. 31 Our study shows that the neutrophils are important for clearance of BRSV excreted into the lumen of the respiratory tract, whereas neutrophils migrating through the bronchial epithelium did not contain BRSV antigen. Further investigations are needed to determine whether the neutrophils might contribute to the observed tissue damage by releasing inflammatory products.

            "text": "The clearance of virus in the BRSV-infected calves elapsed in the same order as the replication. Already on PID 8 the virus had been cleared from the bronchial epithelium and even the BRSV antigen could no longer be detected. Because no calves were killed between PID 8 and PID 15, we have only shown that the replication in the alveoli stopped before PID 15. This leaves a very short time, after the onset of clinical signs, for demonstrating BRSV by virus isolation or antigen demonstration, which is diagnostically important. Furthermore, these findings may explain some of the cases in which HRSV could not be detected postmortem by immunohistochemistry although the virus was demonstrated antemortem. 23, 32 In this study we were able to demonstrate that apoptosis was an important way of BRSV clearance. A large number of apoptotic cells was detected in bronchial epithelium on PID 6, and apoptotic BRSV antigen-containing cells were seen in vacuoles of phagocytizing cells. When regarding that the whole apoptotic process, from development of morphological changes to degradation of phagocytized apoptotic material, has been described to be completed in an hour or so, 33 this process seemed to be the major way of viral clearance in the bronchial epithelium. The phagocytizing cells in the epithelium were mononuclear, but because of the large vacuoles and sparse cytoplasm in these cells, it was difficult to identify the cell type. However, they were probably not macrophages because the number of CD68-positive mature macrophages in the epithelium was very low compared to the high number of phagocytizing cells. Instead it is more likely that the phagocytizing cells were neighboring epithelial cells. Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by neighboring cells has also been suggested after physiological apoptosis in hormone-dependent tissues 34 and in the normal colonic mucosa. 35 CD8\u03e9 T cells have been described to be important for viral clearance in the lungs of RSV-infected mice and in BRSV-infected gnotobiotic calves. 36, 37 In the present study, we demonstrated an increasing number of CD8\u03e9 T cells in the lungs during infection, but until PID 8 these T cells were not demonstrated in the epithelium of the bronchi. On PID 6, when apoptosis was detected in the bronchial epithelium, CD8\u03e9 T cells could not be demonstrated among the bronchial epithelial cells in any of the eight BRSV-infected calves, whereas a moderate number of CD8\u03e9 T cells was detected in lamina propria of the bronchi in these calves. Later in the course of infection (PID 15), a few CD8\u03e9 T cells were seen in the bronchial epithelium and lumen of bronchi in one calf suggesting an impeded passage into the bronchial epithelium and lumen of the bronchi before PIDs 8 to 15. This is consistent with a study in BRSV-infected gnotobiotic calves in which an increased number of CD8\u03e9 T cells was observed by flow cytometry in bovine lung tissue from PIDs 3 to 5 but not in bronchoalveolar lavage until 10 to 15 days after infection. 38 As for the CD8\u03e9 T cells, we saw an increasing number of CD4 \u03e9 T cells during the infection, and likewise, the CD4 \u03e9 T cells were not detected among the bronchial epithelial cells until PID 8.",

            "text": "Killing by cytotoxic T cells is generally described to occur either by granzyme/perforin mediated lysis of target cells or by Fas ligand (FasL)/Fas interaction; 39 both pathways requiring a direct cell-to-cell contact. However, our study indicates that the efficient clearance of BRSV from the bronchial epithelium is mediated by another mechanism than contact-dependent T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In vitro studies using a lung epithelial cell line (A549) has demonstrated that both Fas and FasL were up-regulated after infection with RSV, 40,41 however, absent inhibition of apoptosis after blocking the Fas/FasL pathway suggested a limited role of the Fas/FasL pathway in RSV-induced apoptosis of A549 cells. 41 Because of a strong activation of caspase-12 the authors instead suggested that a direct RSV-induced apoptosis occurred through an endoplasmic reticulum stress response. 41 There is an increasing amount of data suggesting that direct contact-dependent cytolysis of virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes is not the only way of viral clearance. 42 It seems that some cytopathic viruses are mainly controlled by soluble mediators such as antibodies and cytokines produced in the immediate vicinity of an infected cell. 43 Interestingly, we have previously detected high levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 (TNF-\u2423) in lung lavage of experimental BRSV-infected calves killed on PIDs 6 and 7. 44 In contrast, the level of TNF-\u2423 was low or not detectable in calves killed before PID 6 and in mock-inoculated calves. It is, therefore, possible that this local production of TNF-\u2423 is important for the RSV clearance by inducing apoptosis; maybe in combination with a noncytopathic mechanism as described for hepatitis B virus in which in vivo studies in mice have shown that anti-viral cytokines (especially interferon-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423) released by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes were able to purge virus from infected cells in a noncytopathic manner. 45, 46 Further studies are necessary to reveal if the TNF-\u2423 is produced by the T cell situated in the lamina propria.",

Furthermore, the perforin knockout mice showed enhanced disease together with increased and prolonged production of interferon-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423. These observations are consistent with our results demonstrating that a direct contact-dependent mechanism might not be the main mechanism of RSV clearance. However, our observations of a T-cell contact-independent mechanism of viral clearance only apply for the bronchial infection. We can demonstrate widespread apoptosis in the alveoli on PID 8 and these apoptotic alveolar cells were also phagocytized, but it was not possible to identify the phagocytizing cells and it was impossible to decide whether there was direct cell contact to T cells.",

Furthermore, the BRSV-infected calves, from which bacteria and mycoplasma had been isolated, had similar clinical signs and pathological changes as seen in BRSV-infected calves without co-infections.

Increasing infiltration with CD8\u03e9 T cells was seen during infection, but they could not be demonstrated between the bronchial epithelial cells until PIDs 8 to 15 when viral replication no longer could be demonstrated in the bronchial epithelial cells.
