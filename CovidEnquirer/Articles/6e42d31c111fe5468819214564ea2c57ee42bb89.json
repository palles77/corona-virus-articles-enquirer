Numerous studies in other body sites have clearly identified links between infections and autoimmunity and autoimmune disease [4, 5] . Only a limited number of studies have been reported in which retinal disorders have been evaluated to study this relationship. We will begin this chapter with a brief overview of infection and autoimmunity in the eye. This will be followed by specific examples of infections and autoimmunity in the retina. We will highlight two human diseases triggered by Onchocerca volvulus or Toxoplasma gondii and an experimental model referred to as experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR), triggered by the murine coronavims, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).",

            "text": "The visual axis is a precious sense. The eye is an organ that is known to have immunologic processes that are both infectious and non-infectiously driven. The eye is unique in that it lacks lymphatics and still enjoys an intimate relationship with the immune system. An inflammatory process in the eye is termed an uveitis, and it in no way reflects the origin of the inflammatory process nor where it is located in the eye. While there are many descrip-tions of inflammatory processes in the eye, there are three major presentations of these conditions. If the inflammatory condition is centered in the front of the eye, the process is termed an anterior uveitis. If upon examination the dominant part of the inflammation is centered in the vitreous of the eye, it is termed an intermediate uveitis. Finally, if inflammation occurs in the back of the eye, that is centered in the retina or the choroid of the eye, it is termed a posterior uveitis. Clearly inflammatory conditions may involve several parts of the eye, and if all anatomic of the eye are involved it is termed a panuveitis. Most of the cormqaents of this chapter will address disorders of the back of the eye, i.e., those involving the retina. Eye specialists have the great advantage of being able to visualize directly the parts of the eye that can be involved in an inflammatory process. In addition to simple visualization, many additional tools can be readily applied. Electrophysiologic testing is easily and frequently performed, This is an excellent way to evaluate the retina's ability to react to a light stimulus. Fluorescein angiography, the use of dye injected into an arm vein and then rapid photographs are taken of the back of the eye. This approach helps to visualize the vascular system and the integrity of the retina. The severity of the inflammatory response can be graded by direct visualization of the inflammatory response in the eye. Most inflammatory process that we recognize will have a cellular response associated with it. We also know that antibody mediated pathology, as seen in such entities as cancer associated retinopathy, can occur, but appears to be the distinct minority of cases.",

            "text": "The eye is a complex organ from the point of view of the immune system. It is known that antigen placed into the anterior chamber of the eye will induce a deviated immune response, with a marked decrease in cell mediated responses, but an intact cytotoxic and B-cell response is seen [ 1 ] . Addtionally, the retina is a complex structure with several layers needed to turn the light stimulus into a chemical signal ultimately sent to the brain. At the photoreceptor level and the single layer just below it, the retinal pigment epithelium, a number of uveitogenic antigens have been identified and characterized [2] . Two antigens in particular, the retinal S-antigen and the interphotoreceptor retinal binding protein (IRBP), have been used to develop a model of autoimmune ocular disease which is termed experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) [3] . This model has many qualities of the disease seen in humans and has helped to better understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to disease. One major difference between this model and the human disease is of course that it is not spontaneous. It is not clear what triggers the human disease. This chapter will explore one such trigger, that of ocular infection. Several entities, some based on animal models, other seen in the clinic, will be discussed to elucidate the possible role between infection and autoimmunity.",

            "text": "Experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR) is an animal model system that we generated in the 1990's to demonstrate that a virus can trigger a progressive retinal degenerative disease [6] . Studies during the past 12 years have identified that this degenerative eye disease is composed of three basic components; a virus component, a genetic component and an immunologic component [7, 8] . In our system, we selected a naturally occurring neurotrophic strain (JHM) of a mouse hepatitis virus that infects and persists within the retina. The virus causes an acute infection, marked by virus replication in distinct retinal cells, neutralizing antibody and the production of cytokines, namely IFN-gamma. This disease also has a genetic component. That is, different strains of mice behave differently after virus infection. Two strains of mice, BABL/c and CD-1, were extensively studied after coronavirus infection. During the early phase of the disease (day 1-8) the virus infects and replicates within the retina of both BALB/c and CD-1 mouse stains [9] . However, on days 10 to 140, only the BALB/c mice experience a late phase of the disease which is marked by a retinal degeneration. The CD-1 mouse does not undergo the retinal degenerative phase but rather, the retina returns to a normal architecture within 20 days. Finally, the immune component of this disease is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies, specifically, anti-retinal and anti-RPE auto-antibodies. The presence of these antibodies are observed only in the retinal degenerative susceptible BALB/c mice. These auto-antibodies are absent in the retinal degeneration resistant CD-1 mice. In summary, ECOR is a virus triggered retinal degenerative disease that is influenced by both genetics and the immune response. In this session we will discuss in detail the virologic, pathologic, immunologic, genetic and autoimmune factors involved in this model system.",

Either of these strains are responsible for approximately 50% of the common colds. A new human coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [12] . One of the closest relatives to the human S ARS-Coronavirus is the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The JHM strain of MHV is the most thoroughly studied neurotropic coronavirus. It causes both acute and chronic central nervous system effects in mice and rats. Acute encephalomyelitis and chronic CNS disease have been observed in mice. In rats an autoimmune disease known as subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, has been described.",

Between day 3 and 6 virus antigen was also detected in Mullerlike cells that span the multiple layers of the neural retina. Occasionly, virus antigen was also observed within the ganglion cells. After day 7, infectious virus and viral antigen could not be detected within the retina.

Gene expression for these cytokines was not detected in retinas from untreated or mock-injected mice. EIA analysis of sera identified the presence of these same cytokine proteins in virus infected mice and not in untreated or mock injected mice. The presence of retinal mRNA for IFN-y was also associated with the upregulation of MHC Class I and II molecules within the retina. MHC class I and II molecules were not identified within the normal or mock injected retinas. It was noted that the first cell to express these MHC molecules was the RPE cell. This cell is also the first cell to express new viral antigens during the infection in vivo and is persistently infected in vitro [ 17] . It is critically important to point out that this RPE cell has been shown to process and present retinal and non-retinal antigens to sensitized T cells and is upregulated to express MHC class II molecules during retinal autoimmune and degenerative processes [ 18, 19] .",

When C57B1 and AJJ mice were evaluated, we observed a disease pattern similar to that seen in BALB/c mice. However, retinal changes were less severe than those seen in BALB/c mice. Retinal tissue damage induced by JHM virus in CD-1 mice was very different (Table 1) . Only the early phase of the disease, consisting of retinal vasculitis, was observed. These CD-1 mice did not develop the retinal degenerative disease. In fact, by day 20 PI, the retina had a normal appearance. These studies underscored the role of genetics in ECOR and showed that the genetics of the host profoundly affected the nature of retinal tissue damage.",

For example, during the acute phase of the disease (days 3-10), virus load in the retina, production of anti-virus antibody, blood-retina barrier breakdown, lymphoid trafficking and MHC Class I and II staining were similar in both mouse strains. Moreover, gene expression for IFN-~, in pooled retinas from CD-1 mice was positive at PI day 4 and 8. Again, this is similar to the pattern observed in BALB/c mice. The disease pattern in the late phase was clearly different in the two mouse strains. BALB/c mice displayed a retinal degeneration with blood-retina barrier breakdown, and CD-1 mice showed a normal retinal architecture. Immuno-staining observed at day 20 in CD-1 mice was clearly different from that observed in BALB/c mice, in that CD-1 mice were negative for MHC class I and II expression and CD8 T cells were absent from the retina.",

Inasmuch as viruses are know to trigger an autoimmune phenomena and some human retinopathies may be associated with autoantibody formation, we studied the possible production of antiretinal autoantibodies [ 11] . We found that the retinal degenerative process in BALB/c mice was associated with the presence of antiretinal autoantibodies (Table 2 ). These autoantibodies were not found in sera from normal or mock-injected mice. The presence of antibodies to retinal tissue was evaluated by immunoperoxidase staining on frozen sections of normal rat eyes. Two patterns of staining were observed, reactivity in the neural retinal and reactivity in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (Fig. 1) . The antiretinal autoantibodies first appeared as IgM class antibodies. This was later replaced by IgG class autoantibodies. The anti-RPE cell autoantiboedies were predominantly of the IgG class.",

While suspected for a long period, it was not till the early 1950's that the parasite was shown to cause ocular disease. Helenor Campbell Wilder, working at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, DC, identified the organism in eyes that were believed to have other types of inflammatory processes, particularly tuberculosis [23] . It is interesting to note that a similar observation has been made more recently in Nepal, where many cases of ocular tuberculosis have now been rediagnosed as toxoplasmosis of the eye.",

Two forms of the organism can be found in man, cysts and tachyzoites. The tachyzoites (the proliferative intracellar form) are believed to be the cause of most of the tissue damage in human, though often it is very difficult to demonstrate the presence of the stage of the organism. The bradyzoites (the latent form of the organism found in cysts) are found in host cells. Hundreds of bradyzoites (with very slow metabolic rates) have a propensity towards neural tissue such as the eye and brain, but are also found in skeletal muscle and heart. It is assumed that attacks occur with rupture of the cyst, leading to a pouring out of bradyzoites and then the conversion of bradyzoites to tachyzoites. The mechanisms that lead to cyst rupture are still unknown.",

This longitudinal study measured serum antibody responses to the retinal S-antigen, a \"P\" antigen (thought to contain rhodopsin), and new antigen designated p59 ag, all isolated from bovine retina. They reported that all the patients initially tested showed antibody responses to all three antigens. The anti-S-antigen responses tended to decrease with clinical improvement, while the anti-P antibodies remained high even after the acute attack was over. A more recent report by Whittle and colleagues [26] looked at a larger number of toxoplasmosis patients. In this study a total of 36 patients with toxoplasma retinochoroiditis were evaluated for evidence of anti-retinal antibodies. Thirty-four of these sera showed antibodies directed against the photoreceptor layer of the retina when tested with indirect immunofluorescence. Six of 16 controls showed a similar staining pattern with the p value as reported as < 0.001. Interestingly, using an EIA to measure the presence of anti-S-antigen antibodies, the researchers observed that 27 of 36 sera from toxoplasmosis retinochoroiditis patients were positive, but so were 10 of 16 normals, with a calculated p value of greater than 0.05. The antibodies seen in the two assays did not appear to run in parallel. The author's interpretation of their data was that the extent of anti-retinal antibodies could not be explained by anti-S-antigen findings alone. They argued that these findings probably did not reflect an epiphenomenon since patients with idiopathic retinal vasculitis were also evaluated. In that study the number of sera positive from patients with idiopathic retinal vasculitis was considerably lower than that found in the toxoplasmosis group.",

In addition to the retinal S-antigen, we also evaluated the response to crude toxoplasma antigen and to puri-fled antigens from the parasite [28] . In addition, we performed an EIA to look for anti-S-antigen antibodies and HLA phenotyping to see if a specific HLA type was associated with S-antigen responsiveness. Of the 40 patient's lymphocytes tested, 16 (40%) had proliferative responses with a stimulation index above 2.5 (see Fig. 2 ).

In 1987, Chan and associates identified that a majority of onchocerciasis patients had anti-retinal antibodies in their sera and vitreous [31 ] . Using FA assays on human retina tissue, they observed reactivity in the inner retina and photoreceptor layers. During the 1990's, Braun, McKechnie and associates performed a number of studies to elucidate the nature of the autoimmune reactivity [32] [33] [34] [35] . They identified a recombinant antigen in O. volvulus that showed immunologic cross-reactivity with a component of the RPE [32, 33] . By western blot analysis, an antibody to a 22,000 mw antigen (OV39) of O. volvulus recognized a 44,000 mw component of the RPE cell. Subsequent studies have shown that hr 44 Ag is present in the optic nerve, epithelial layers of iris, ciliary body and RPE. Although OV39 and the hr 44 proteins are not homologus, they did show limited amino acid sequence identity [36] . Immunization of Lewis rats with either OV39 from O. volvulus or hr 44 from human retinal tissue, induced ocular pathology [35] . The retinal disease in the rat was characterized by extensive breakdown of the posterior blood-ocular barrier, iridocyclitis and retinitis and the activation of retinal microglia. These studies indicate that, molecular mimicry between O. volvulus and human RPE protein may contribute to the retinopathy found in patients with onchoceriacis.",

As the name infers, they are all characterized by whitish lesions of varying sizes that are found strewn throughout the fundus. Some have a significant inflammatory reaction associated with them while others do not. The natural history of some may lead to significant visual handicap while others may not. Some of these disorders seem to progress while others fade away. The disorders that are included in this list include such entities as acute multifocal placoid posterior pigment epitheliopathy (AMPPE), serpiginous choroiditis, the multifocal evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS), and multifocal choroiditis. The underlying cause of these diseases is unknown. Many of these disorders seem to be preceded by a viral illness, and one disorder, AMPPE, was hypothesized to be due to the an Epstein-Barr infection [37] . This concept is no longer thought to be the case [38] . However, a few patients have been treated with anti-viral medications, with unclear responses. The most common therapy for all of these conditions is that of immunosuppression and therapy is directed against what is believed to be an autoimmune, or least non-infectious, process in the back of the eye.",

            "text": "In summary, we have reviewed the evidence that three distinct classes of infectious agents have been implicated in the development of autoimmune processes within the retina. These data also indicate that distinct pathogenic mechanisms are involved in the induction of autoimmunity triggered by these three organisms. In T. gondii infections, the persistence and chronic reactivation of the organism is probably responsible for introduction and presentation of sequestered retinal epitopes to the immune system. In O. volvulus infections, molecular mimicry between the organism and human RPE protein may contribute to the retinal pathology. In ECOR, similar processes are induced in coronavirus-infected mice displaying either retinal degeneration susceptibility or retina degeneration resistance. However, recent evidence indicates that differences in time of induction, in duration and intensity of immune reactivity may contribute to autoimmune reactivity in BALB/c mice.",
