Pasteur used a Pravaz syringe to inoculate sheep in the famed controlled challenge experiment demonstrating protection against anthrax, after which he honored Dr. Jenner by broadening his predecessor's term-vaccination-to mean the administration of immunizing agents for various diseases, not just smallpox. 8 With acceptance of the germ theory and resulting sterilization of medical equipment by the early 20th century, 9 and with mass production of needles and glass (later plastic) syringes by mid century, hypodermic injection became the norm for convenient, accurate, and certain administration of most vaccines and many drugs. Regrettably, aseptic practice was ignored in many developing countries, 10 , 11 and by nonmedical-intravenous-drug users everywhere, 12 leading to widespread iatrogenic and selfinflicted disease transmission during that era once decried as the Injection Century. 13 Other drawbacks of N-S include needlestick injuries to health care workers, 14 , 15 needle-phobia and discomfort for patients facing increasingly crowded immunization schedules, 16 , 17 and the costs and complexity of safe disposal of sharps in the medical waste stream. 18 In the early 21st century, new targets for disease control and eradication, the expansion of philanthropic efforts to make expensive new vaccines affordable for the world's children, and promising results for novel techniques have stimulated research on vaccine delivery that avoids N-S and may be dosage sparing. Preparedness efforts for threatened pandemics and bioterrorism have also rekindled 19 , 20 past interest 21 in novel needlefree methods for mass vaccination campaigns.",

Often, prefixes of Latin (intra, per, trans) or Greek (epi) origin are paired hetero-lingually with root terms for skin of the other etymology, derma (G.) and cutis (L.). Some recent coinage results from commercial intent to claim trade names from among this synonymy. In this chapter, cutaneous vaccination is the preferred term to encompass all methods for delivery of antigen anywhere into or onto the skin. Classical intradermal injection, or just intradermal (ID), is generally reserved for a type of cutaneous vaccination in which a bolus of liquid is deposited into the dermis to raise a visible bleb, as in the traditional Mantoux injection (discussed below).",

The stratum malpighii layer comprises the primary component of the epidermis, and its dividing and growing keratinocytes serve both a structural function-limiting the passage of water and other molecules-and an immunologic role. Keratinocytes germinate just above the basement membrane, which demarcates the boundary between epidermis and deeper dermis. These cells then grow, flatten, mature, and senesce in increasingly superficial strata until they reach the surface and are sloughed. The main product of this cell is keratinohyalin, a dense lipid that helps form a waterproof barrier. The lateral edges of adjacent keratinocytes are tightly linked by desmosomes, which maintain the strength of the epidermis and also contribute to its resistance to the passage of foreign matter or molecules. 51 , 52 The topmost horny layer of the epidermis is the stratum corneum , comprised of staggered courses of dead keratinocytesalso known as corneocytes-in a lipid bilayer matrix.

The subcutaneous tissue below the skin, sometimes referred to as the hypodermis, consists primarily of fat; it varies widely in thickness between different body surfaces and, of course, individuals. Skin thicknesses have been mapped in children to identify the histologic suitability of sites for cutaneous vaccination. 53 Equally important is selecting skin sites that are easily accessed so as to minimize disrobing and loss of privacy. In smallpox eradication, the volar surface of the forearm was commonly used because it was quickly accessible, the vaccinator could hold the vaccinee's wrist for stabilization (and to prevent escape), and the scar was easily visible to verify prior vaccination. 1 The speed of diffusion of therapeutic substances transcellularly through the dead and living keratinocytes, and via the intercellular channels between them, correlates with smaller molecules (< 500 Da), lower melting points, increased lipophilicity (and correspondingly lower water solubility), higher (saturated) concentrations, and a relative lack of pendant groups that form hydrogen bonds that slow diffusion. 31, 54 The specific mechanisms that produce the resulting immune response when vaccine antigen is introduced into the skin are not entirely clear. With stimulation, keratinocytes can produce proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 1 [IL-1]) and can themselves function as antigen-presenting cells by displaying major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens (human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-DR), as well as intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1). 55 Epidermal Langerhans cells are believed to play a key role in cutaneous immunization, although dermal dendritic cells and other well-known immune system players, such as CD8 + and CD4 + T lymphocytes, mast cells, and macrophages, also circulate or reside in the epidermis or dermis. 36, 37, 39, [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] The immature Langerhans cells reside like sentinels among the keratinocytes in the epidermis, comprising about a quarter of the skin surface area, 61 where they efficiently capture foreign antigens by phagocytosis or endocytosis. Like dendritic cells in other tissues (see Chapter 5), on activation (see Figure 61 -1A) these professional antigen-presenting cells (APC) process the antigen as they migrate to draining lymph nodes. There, now mature, they express high levels of class II MHC molecules, and present the antigen brought from the skin to T-helper (Th) lymphocytes, a critical step for the subsequent immune responses orchestrated by the latter cells.",

A rotary lancet first described in the 1870s consisted of a shaft attached to the center of a small disk, the opposite (patient's side) of which contained a central tine surrounded by smaller satellite tines. The twirling of the disk in a drop of vaccine on the skin produced much abrasion of the skin and often severe reactions from both vaccine and common bacterial contaminants. In the less traumatic multiplepressure method introduced in the early 1900s, liquid vaccine was placed onto the skin and a straight surgical needle, held tangentially to the skin with its tip in the drop, was repeatedly and firmly pressed sideways into the limb 10 times for primary vaccination, and 30 times for revaccination. 62 Multitine devices have also been used. 63, 64 Bifurcated needle",

Now referred to as the Mantoux method, this procedure has become the common route for ID injection of various antigens (see Figure 61 -2G). A short-bevel, fine-gauge needle, usually 27 gauge (0.016 inch, 0.4060 mm diameter), is inserted, bevel up, at a 5 to 15-degree angle into slightly stretched skin, often the volar surface of the forearm. 78 The tip is advanced about 3 mm until the entire bevel is covered. Upon injection of fluid, proper location of the bevel in the dermis creates a bleb, or a wheal, as the basement membrane and epidermis above are stretched by the fluid. Leakage onto the skin indicates insufficient penetration to cover the bevel. Failure to produce a bleb indicates an improperly deep location of the fluid in the subcutaneous tissue. Drawbacks to the Mantoux method for mass vaccination campaigns are the training, skill, and extra time needed to accomplish it correctly.",

Bruyn and colleagues found GMTs in children receiving 0.2 mL intradermally of influenza vaccine to be higher than in those receiving the same dosage subcutaneously, 121 as did Davies and coworkers 140 and Tauraso and colleagues 131 administering 0.1 mL by both routes. When administering by the ID route, one-tenth (0.1 mL) the SC dose (1.0 mL) in varying dilutions below the labeled dosage of 800 chick cell agglutinating (CCA) units/mL, Stille and coworkers also found greater ID responses, but only when the SC dosage was low, at 8 or 0.08 CCA (ID dosage: 0.8 and 0.008, respectively). 127 In contrast, SC responses exceeded ID ones when the standard SC dosage was used or reduced by only one log (80 CCA; ID, 80 and 8 CCA, respectively). This suggested a linear ID dosage-response curve, but a sigmoid SC one, which favored the ID route at the lowerdosage end. On the other hand, when identical reduced dosages for a new shifted \"Asian\" strain were given by the two routes (80, 40, or 20 CCA, compared with 200 per full 1.0 mL), both McCarroll and colleagues, 141 studying hospital employees 18 to 65 years of age, and Klein and coworkers, 142 studying infants 2 months to 5 years of age, found little difference in responses between the ID and SC routes. McCarroll speculated that the ID superiority in earlier studies was the result of an anamnestic effect not present that season. Klein simply doubted any ID superiority when equal volumes are used.",

[160] [161] [162] [163] [164] As polio eradication nears its goal, it will be necessary to remove from circulation the live Sabin strains of oral polio vaccine (OPV), with their propensity to revert to virulence and to circulate from vaccinees to others, and to replace them with injectable, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). However, the latter vaccine in full 0.5-mL dosages costs about 20 times as much per dose as OPV, promoting a search for cost-saving strategies that also avoid the introduction of needles into the polio eradication program. 165 Recent clinical research in Oman sponsored by WHO and others found seroconversion rates equivalent to full dosages given intramuscularly when IPV was delivered intradermally by needle-free jet injectors in 0.1 mL dosage-sparing volumes into the skin to infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, 166 but GMTs were consistently lower. At the earlier ages of 6, 10, and 14 weeks, studied in Cuba, the ID responses were somewhat lower, perhaps from maternal antibody interference. 167 A study in the Philippines compared one-fifth dosages by Mantoux injection with full dosages by the IM route at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age, finding inverse titers of 8 or greater to all three types in 99% to 100% of all participants, concluding that the reduced-dosage ID route was non-inferior to the IM route. 168 An Indian study of older children, 6 to 9 months of age, using a different investigational jet injector for ID delivery, deemed more than half of the injections \"inadequate\" because of a wheal diameter of less than 3 mm, or because more than a \"small drop\" of vaccine remained on the skin surface. 169 Overall, seroconversion rates and GMTs to all polio types were lower by reduced-dosage by the ID route than by full IM dosages, especially for such \"inadequate\" injections. Another study in the Netherlands of the same device is underway. More are planned. 170",

Thus, there are but a few animal models of immunization onto bare, untreated skin. 242-244 Newer methods to facilitate antigen delivery to the epidermis involve painlessly stripping, abrading, scraping, piercing, vaporizing, shocking, vibrating, bombarding, and otherwise permeabilizing the barrier of the stratum corneum. Some methods combine several processes. These have been detailed in reviews by others. 27 , 29 , 31 , 33 , 35-37 , 39-43 , 54 , 60 , 245-248 Stripping and abrading Tape and friction A variety of simple tools have been used to remove the stratum corneum. Common cellophane adhesive tape may be applied to the skin and pulled away, carrying away dead keratinocytes with each repetition. Such tape-stripping has been shown to enhance cytotoxic-T-cell and cytokine immune responses on subsequent application of various antigens and adjuvants to the skin in mice. [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] Similarly, rubbing gauze, emery paper, electrocardiographic (ECG) pads, or pumice on the skin removes cells by their abrasive effects, and this has been found to enhance immune responses in humans. 256 Application of cyanoacrylate glue followed by stripping the skin to apply antigen to the exposed hair follicles has been described, 257 but its practicality has been questioned. 37",

Anthrax rPA with alum or CpG adjuvants applied with the MEA device to mouse skin produced equivalent or better immune responses than IM controls (although not as good as an ID microneedle), whereas immune responses and challenge survival were significantly less among MEA-immunized rabbits compared with IM controls. 101 Among cynomolgus monkeys vaccinated by six \"swipes\" of the MEA, with SC and 34-gauge, microneedle-based ID controls, all animals seroconverted to an investigational recombinant Japanese encephalitis vaccine. 105 Those vaccinated by swiping the MEA through a drop of vaccine already on the skin showed neutralizing antibody responses in the same range as the SC controls, whereas applying vaccine after the abrasion appeared to be less effective.",

In a series of murine studies using solid metal microneedles coated with inactivated influenza viruses, cutaneous vaccination induced robust immune responses-often better than equivalent dosages in controls injected by the SC route-as well as protection against lethal viral challenge. [325] [326] [327] [328] [329] [330] [331] [332] [333] [334] When coated with BCG, the same microneedle platform (see Figure 61 -3D) was highly immunogenic in guinea pigs, with robust cell-mediated responses in lungs and spleen comparable to those with Mantoux injection. 335 Similarly, plasmid DNA antigen for hepatitis C, coated on 500-\u03bcm-long needles, primed specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vaccinated mice more readily than did typical \"gene gun\" delivery 336,337 or conventional needle. 338 Inactivated rotavirus vaccine-developed to avoid the inhibitory effect of breast milk on live, oral vaccines 339 -was coated onto this microneedle platform and found immunogenic in an animal model. 340 For most of these formulations prepared at GA Tech, a key ingredient of the carboxycellulose matrix of the dried coating was trehalose, one of several sugars, including sucrose, that have been found useful in protecting protein antigens from damage by drying and freezing, and thereby improving vaccine thermostability. 341 Another center for microneedle research, in Australia, 342 developed a novel nitrogen gas jet-drying method for coating antigen onto silicon that overcomes the challenges of dip-coating closely spaced projections, 324,343,344 but it still elutes within 2 to 3 minutes upon skin entry (see Figure 61 -3F). It has achieved 1/30th to 1/100th dosage sparing compared with the IM route in a mouse model for influenza. 345,346 Other antigens studied with good results in murine models with this platform-called the Nanopatch and recently transferred to industry 347 -include human papillomavirus, 348 herpes simplex type 2, 349,350 and the West Nile and chikungunya viruses. 351 Coulman and coworkers studied nanoparticles and DNA plasmids expressing \u03b2-galactosidase and fluorescent proteins applied to the epidermal surface of ex vivo human breast skin donated at mastectomy. 352 After applying the microneedles to the skin for 10 seconds, they were able to verify epidermal penetration and gene expression by a variety of histologic and photometric means. Later work by this Welsh group reported decreased pain in clinical studies with 180-\u03bcm and 280-\u03bcm microneedles compared with the 25-gauge conventional needle, 353 as well as morphologic changes suggestive of immune activation in human Langerhans cells after intradermal injection of influenza virus-like particles into excised human skin. 354 This group also found that both public and private immunization providers were positive, in focus-group discussions, toward microneedles as a change from conventional needle-syringe delivery. 355 Research on and development of coated microneedles for vaccination are also underway by many other groups. 292,293,302,356",

As the latter may be soiled with blood or tissue fluid, they should be discarded with conventional red-bag medical waste, along with used bandages and similar materials. 587 For many developing countries, where inadvertent or intentional reuse of nonsterile needle-syringes is a serious problem, 10,11 modeling indicated significant cost savings for the use of needle-free JIs compared with needle-syringes, especially when the indirect costs of iatrogenic disease resulting from the latter were included. 589,590 (Current best practice aims for all vaccination syringes in these countries to be auto-disabling to prevent reuse, 591 but this goal is far from achieved. 592 )",

The pistons of the majority of modern JIs are pushed by the sudden release of energy stored in a compressed metal spring, and a few use compressed gas such as CO 2 or N 2 (see Table 61 -1). Investigational JIs are powered by the expanding pressure of chemical combustion, a technology similar to that found in automotive safety air bags, 84d,302,594,595 as well as by Lorentz-force electromagnetic induction. 595a The source of energy to compress the spring is usually supplied manually or pedally through an integral or separate tool to apply mechanical advantage or hydraulic pressure. A few use electrical power from batteries or wall (main) electrical current. An experimental JI system controlled by electronic microprocessors has been proposed, 596 but its cost and practicality for routine immunization remain unknown.",

Jet injectors for classic ID delivery offer the additional advantage of simplicity over the tedious and difficult classic Mantoux injection, as well as the ability to use existing off-theshelf vaccines without reformulation. Older MUNJI models, such as the Ped-O-Jet, used specialized nozzles with recessed orifices offset by 45 degrees from perpendicular to the skin, creating an air gap that weakened its jet stream so as to leave the dose in the skin (see Figure 61 consequent TST reaction sizes 74,633 led WHO to discourage JI use for BCG and TST. 634,635 For devices without a specialized ID nozzle, some vaccinators attach spacers or tubing to a regular nozzle, creating a gap between orifice and skin, which weakens the jet and provides space for a bleb that leaves the dose in the skin. 22 This ID technique was pursued investigationally for local anesthesia 637 and DNA vaccines. [638] [639] [640] As described earlier (see \"Poliomyelitis\"), WHO and others involved in polio eradication are pursuing the use of DSJIs for needle-free, dosage-sparing ID delivery of IPV once OPV is discontinued for both technical reasons and cost (full-dosage IPV is 20 times more costly than OPV). 166-169 , 641 Other vaccines that have been studied for ID delivery by DSJIs include HIV/AIDS 584 , 639 and influenza, 642 and studies are underway or planned for dengue, 230 , 579 , 580 human papillomavirus, and rabies.

This led to warnings and discontinuation of their use by public health authorities, 718 , 719 and to market withdrawal of the Ped-O-Jet and discontinuation of its US military use in 1997. 497 , 720 In the mid 2000s, a MUNJI was reengineered with disposable caps to try to prevent contaminating blood or tissue fluid from splashing back onto the reusable nozzle, potentially to infect the next patient. 721 The cap contained three plastic washers with axially aligned central holes of about 1 mm in diameter for the jet stream to pass in one direction along the centimeter-wide gap between orifice and skin. However, after injections with saline of volunteers in China who carried hepatitis B virus, 8% of subsequent ejectates into vials-representing the next vaccinees in a clinic or mass campaign-were found by polymerase chain reaction assay to contain hepatitis B antigen. 722 High-speed microcinematography also revealed extensive splashback from the skin during injection with MUNJIs. 496 This body of evidence supports the conclusion that the design of MUNJIs is inherently unsafe, and any reuse of fluid pathways or unsterile components that are in direct or indirect contact with consecutive patients should be abandoned. Even if contamination could be shown to be extremely rare, it is unlikely that policymakers could be convinced to set any level of acceptable risk.",

The major potential advantages of respiratory immunization are that it avoids the risks and concerns associated with parenteral injection, and it generally provides stronger mucosal immunity than vaccination by that route. However, multiple obstacles (see \"Challenges for respiratory delivery of vaccines\", later) have restricted wider application. As of 2011, FluMist was the only respiratory vaccine in general use. In contrast, the respiratory route is used to deliver a wide and expanding variety of pharmaceutical products. 752 , 753 The importance of mucosal immunity is that it prevents infection at the portals of entry for the great majority of human pathogens-the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. In contrast, systemic immunity clears infection only after successful invasion, by limiting replication and destroying the pathogens. Ideally, both mucosal and systemic immunity should be raised against targeted pathogens. Strong mucosal immunity may enhance the benefits of immunization for some diseases. For example, by preventing the initial infection, mucosal immunity can reduce the risk of transmission to others, in addition to preventing clinical disease. Prevention of infection at the mucosal surface may be especially important for diseases for which effective systemic immunity has been difficult to achieve, such as tuberculosis and AIDS.",

Interspecies differences in respiratory immunologic tissue organization limit interpretation of animal target-tissue research results for humans. Moreover, the size and anatomy of the respiratory tracts of common research animals differ greatly from those in humans. For example, in small animals such as rodents, nose drops may deposit to the entire respiratory tract, which would not be the case in humans. Balmelli and colleagues estimated that 30% of 20 \u03bcL of vaccine given to mice as IN drops deposited into the lungs. 767 Many viruses and bacteria that infect humans do not grow well in animal models. For example, species-specific differences in the distribution of sialic acid receptors on cell surfaces is a crucial factor in tissue and host specificity of influenza A viruses, which limits the number of animal models suitable for influenza research. 768 Such species-specific differences can make it difficult to use animals to study attenuated live vaccines or vaccine vectors, as well as to challenge animals to assess protection. This impedes the development of safe and effective respiratory vaccines for humans.",

With slight modifications, this nebulizer system was used to deliver live attenuated measles vaccines in multiple clinical trials in Mexico and South Africa, and also to vaccinate over 3 million Mexican children against measles in a mass campaign. [776] [777] [778] [779] The system consists of a general-use (non-medical-grade) compressor that delivers air to a jet nebulizer (from iPi 780,781 ), which holds the vaccine in crushed ice to maintain potency during the vaccination session. The vaccine aerosol is delivered through reusable plastic tubing to a single-use, disposable paper cone (modified from a drinking cup), which is held close to the patient's face for 30 seconds. Typically, the aerosolized dose volume is roughly 0.15 mL, and the mass median aerosol diameter of droplets is 4.3 \u03bcm. 782 In a recent study by Bennett and colleagues, the dose for each child was delivered from the CMD into a single-use, disposable plastic bag to avoid the risk of cross-contamination of the tubing. This reservoir was then separated from the tubing before the child inhaled its contents via a one-way valved mask. Preschoolage children vaccinated from the aerosol reservoir developed higher antibody GMTs than did subjects vaccinated by the SC route. 783 In a study that assessed the distribution of viable vaccine virus across the range of droplet sizes emitted from a CMD, Coates and coworkers estimated that 30% of infective viral particles were contained in droplets with diameters of 5 \u03bcm or less, and 23% were in droplets of greater than 10 \u03bcm. 784 Although the CMD has demonstrated a level of safety and immunogenicity, it is heavy, cumbersome, noisy, and requires outlet (mains) electricity and crushed ice. It is thus not practical for routine vaccination.",

Those vaccinated by the IN route had serum bactericidal antibody titers comparable to that of those vaccinated by conventional injection, and 92% of IN vaccinees had protective titers after the second dose. One third of IN vaccinees reported mild side effects, compared with the two thirds of injection vaccinees who reported mild injection pain. 795 Another dry-powder inhaler, the single-use, disposable Twincer 796 (Figure 61-8E) , dispersed an inulin-based dry-powder subunit influenza vaccine with an aerodynamic particle size distribution suitable for pulmonary administration. 797, 798 Two unique dry-powder delivery devices, the PuffHaler 799-801 (see Figure 61 -8A,B) and the Becton, Dickinson (BD) Solovent 84 (see Figure 61 -8C,D), were developed and tested as part of an initiative to develop a measles vaccine dry powder (MVDP). The project is led by Aktiv-Dry, LLC 799 (see \"Drypowder formulations for respiratory delivery\", later). Each device disperses MVDP into an inexpensive, single-use, disposable reservoir from which the patient inhales, eliminating the risk of cross-contamination. After successful demonstration in the cotton-rat model, 802 MVDP was evaluated in rhesus macaques using PuffHaler and BD Solovent via mask and via the direct IN route from the devices. 803 Respiratory delivery induced robust, significant measles-specific humoral and T-cell responses with no adverse effects. When challenged more than 1 year later, the MVDP-vaccinated macaques were protected from infection with wild-type measles virus. 803 In other studies, the BD Solovent was effective for direct nasal delivery of influenza vaccine to rats, and of anthrax vaccine to rabbits. 101, 804 The CDC developed the AeroVax nebulizer (see Figure 61 -7E,F), in collaboration with Creare, Inc. 22,805 It utilizes a disposable patient interface (nasal prong, oral prong, or mask) and a disposable drug cartridge to prevent cross-contamination. Disposable drug cartridges can be manufactured to generate custom particle size distributions (eg, 10-to 25-\u03bcm droplets for upper-airway delivery, or droplets of 5 \u03bcm or less to reach the lower airway). Delivery of live attenuated measles vaccine via nasal prong was shown to be safe and immunogenic in macaques. 786 A 15-second aerosol delivery by the AeroVax device of influenza virus X31 induced a robust immune response in mice, which protected them against homologous (X31) and heterologous (PR8) influenza challenge. 806 Nasal aerosol delivery of LAIV to ferrets elicited high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies and protected them from homologous virus challenge at conventional (median tissue culture infective dose [TCID 50 ], 10 7 ) and significantly reduced (TCID 50 , 10 3 ) dosages, and provided a significant level of subtype-specific cross-protection. 807 AerovectRx, Inc., 808 acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute this technology.",

First, drops or sprays delivered to the conjunctiva, or to the oral or nasal mucosa, produced inconsistent immune responses. 226,851-859 Second, delivery of small-particle liquid aerosols via pulmonary inhalation to children 10 months of age or older typically produced immune responses in very high proportions of subjects.

They deliver the genetic code for the antigen into cells, and it is replicated to activate the immune system. Viruses used as vaccine vectors should, ideally, have very low pathogenic potential, even in immunocompromised people, as well as the capacity to incorporate the necessary foreign genes for desired antigens, promoters, and adjuvants. Viruses that naturally infect or grow in respiratory tissues are especially well suited as vectors for respiratory immunization. Some studied in animal models include adenoviruses, alpha viruses, poxviruses, baculovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and adeno-associated virus. 884-899 Adenovirus vectors delivered IN in several animal models produced immune responses against many diseases. 286 , 288 , 900-920 For example, defective-complex adenovirus containing Ebola virus genes protected nonhuman primates against aerosol challenge with two Ebola species. 919 Vaccinia strains such as modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) have also been used effectively as vectors for respiratory immunization. 921-927 An MVA vector expressing an HIV-1 antigen induced, by the IN route, antigen-specific mucosal CD8 + T cells in genital tissue and draining lymph nodes of mice, along with serum and vaginal antibodies. 927 One caveat for the use of vectored vaccines is that preexisting immunity, in the population, to the vector virus, either by natural exposure or by previous use in another vaccine, may reduce its effectiveness. However, Song and colleagues reported a series of studies in which adenovirus-vectored vaccines delivered as a fine aerosol to the lungs produced strong immunogenicity even in animals with preexisting anti-adenoviral immunity, suggesting that pulmonary delivery may overcome this limitation to viral vector vaccines. 928",
