In addition, the increasing use of biological therapies will result in more patients at risk of opportunistic infections, albeit to a lesser degree than classic causes of immunocompromise. The type and degree of immune defect dictates the profile of potential opportunistic pathogens; T-cell mediated defects increase the risk of viral (cytomegalovirus and respiratory viruses) and Pneumocystis jirovecii infections, whereas neutrophil defects are associated with bacterial pneumonia and invasive aspergillosis. However, patients often have combinations of immune defects and a wide range of other opportunistic infections can cause pneumonia. The radiological pattern of disease (best assessed by CT scan) and speed of onset also help identify the likely pathogen(s), which can then be supported by targeted investigation including early use of bronchoscopy in selected patients. Rapid and expert clinical assessment can identify the most likely pathogens, which can then be treated aggressively and so provide the best opportunity for a positive outcome.",

Opportunistic lung infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients immunocompromised because of HIV infection, haematological malignancy, aplastic anaemia or chemotherapy treatment, or who are recipients of solid-organ or stem cell transplants, and also may complicate treatment with the new biological therapies for inflammatory conditions. 1 Expert clinical assessment with early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are required for a positive outcome. The CT scan is more sensitive than the chest radiograph at defining the predominant pattern(s) of lung involvement, and when combined with knowledge of the patient's immune status (loss of T-cell or antibody-mediated immunity, or defects in neutrophil-mediated immunity) can often identify the most likely pathogens.

Clinical presentation is classically insidious with slowly increasing dyspnoea, dry cough and hypoxaemia with few physical or radiologic findings, but can be fulminant. 7 Exerciseinduced oxygen desaturation is a sensitive marker. The chest radiograph features are diffuse, bilateral, interstitial infiltrates but can be normal, whereas high-resolution CT scan is much more sensitive and often shows extensive ground glass opacities with an apical distribution and peripheral sparing. Pneumatocoeles are not uncommon, and chronic infection can lead to bizarre-looking cystic changes. PJP cannot be cultured and diagnosis requires identification of the organism in induced sputum or BALF by microscopy with Giemsa and Grocott stains. Immunofluorescence and PCR techniques increase the diagnostic yield but false-positive PCR can occur due to PJP lung colonization. P. jirovecii can be found in BALF for 48e72 hours after starting empirical treatment. First-line treatment is high-dose trimethoprimesulfamethoxazole for 21 days, with adjunctive corticosteroids for severe hypoxaemia (pO 2 <8 kPa) (Table 3) .

Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) is also a significant risk factor and, rarely, patients with chronic lung disease or milder forms of immunosuppression can develop semi-invasive forms of aspergillosis. The most common infective species is Aspergillus fumigatus. 9 The respiratory tract (including the sinuses) is most often affected, although blood-borne spread to internal organs (especially the CNS) and skin can occur. The classic presenting triad in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is fever, chest pain and haemoptysis, although fever alone or various respiratory symptoms can occur. Aspergillus has a predilection for growing into blood vessels, potentially causing fatal massive haemorrhage. Chest radiographs show patchy infiltrates or nodules that can cavitate. CT scan features include macronodules (single or multiple, with or without cavitation), or patchy consolidation. Nodules may show the 'halo' (surrounding ground glass infiltrates due to haemorrhage) or 'air-crescent' (cavitation around a fungal ball) signs. When the patient's immune function recovers, fungal balls may form in a walled-off cavity created by the invasive phase of the disease. Other manifestations of invasive aspergillus infections affecting the lung include: Aspergillus tracheobronchitis, in which infection is restricted to the tracheobronchial tree causing a relentless cough. CT scans may show focal bronchial wall thickening and 'tree and bud' changes. Bronchoscopy is diagnostic, identifying highly inflamed mucosa with necrotic white slough that is positive on culture and histology for Aspergillus. Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) or chronic cavitatory pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA), which are more indolent forms of invasive aspergillosis associated with mild immunosuppression or chronic lung disease. These present with a long history of cough and frequently with marked systemic symptoms, and a slowly progressive patch of consolidation with or without cavitation (CNPA), or an expanding dry upper lobe cavity with a thickened wall (CCPA). 10 BALF. 11 False-positives of the galactomannan antigen test occur with concomitant treatment with b-lactam antibiotics. 9 Definitive diagnosis of IPA is made by positive culture for Aspergillus and histopathologic demonstration of tissue invasion on CT-guided or VATS biopsy specimens. Histology is highly sensitive, septated hyphae showing dichotomous (45 ) branching on Gomori methenamine silver or periodic acid-Schiff staining. However histology specimens are often unavailable, and culture is relatively insensitive, so diagnosis is frequently made on clinical grounds (suggestive CT appearances, high-risk patient, positive galactomannan test).

            "text": "Cryptococcus neoformans pneumonia almost always affects only immunocompromised patients and can present with dyspnoea, cough and fever. 13 HIV/AIDS (CD4 <200 cells/mm 3 ) is the most common risk factor but cryptococcal pneumonia also occurs in other defects of T-cell-mediated immunity (especially post-solid organ transplantation). 14 Radiological features include diffuse interstitial infiltrates, focal consolidation, discrete nodules, and hilar lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis is by microscopic identification (Indian ink stain) or culture from respiratory tract samples. The lung is the port of entry for disseminated infection (usually CNS), and neurological symptoms should prompt a lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid culture.",

Reactivation of latent infection can occur in immunocompromised patients, especially with defects in T-cellmediated immunity, so a history of travel or residence in a high-risk area can be relevant. Common endemic fungi causing pulmonary infections include Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides (Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii), Blastomyces dermatitidis and Sporothrix schenckii. 15 Presentation varies with pathogen but tends to mimic tuberculosis with cavitating pneumonias, pulmonary nodules, enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, or a miliary pattern. Systemic dissemination is not uncommon in immunocompromised patients. Diagnosis requires identification of the fungus in respiratory samples or biopsy material, including bone marrow aspirates. Culture may take 6 weeks. H. capsulatum can be rapidly detected with an antigen detection assay but this may cross-react with other endemic fungi. 16 Serology will identify patients with previous exposure for most fungi, but is not reliable in immunocompromised patients. Mortality is high without timely appropriate treatment.",
