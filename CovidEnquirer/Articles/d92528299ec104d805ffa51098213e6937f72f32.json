            "text": "Astrocytes can function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) upon expression of class II antigens, which are induced by interferon-7 (IFN-7). Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) can act synergistically with IFN-7 with respect to class II expression on a variety of cells. As brain cells themselves can secrete TNF-like factors upon stimulation, we examined the effect of TNF-a on IFN-y-mediated class II induction on astrocytes. TNF-a alone had no effect on class II expression, but did synergize with IFN-7 for enhanced expression of class II antigens. The specificity of TNF-a activity was demonstrated by blocking the amplifying effect of TNF-a with a polyclonal anti-TNF-a antibody. Kinetic analysis of the synergistic effect indicated that optimal TNF-a enhancement of class II expression was observed when astrocytes were pretreated with IFN-7 12-24 h prior to TNF-a addition. A possible mechanism for the synergistic action between IFN-y and TNF-a may be increased TNF-a receptor expression by IFN-y. Astrocytes treated with IFN-7 for 24 h express more TNF-a receptors (3900/ce11) than do untreated astrocytes (2483/ce11), with no significant change in the binding affinity (Ka). These results suggest that the synergistic activity of TNF-a requires an inductive signal from IFN-7, which in part may be increased TNF-a receptor expression. Altogether, our observations indicate that TNF-a enhances ongoing class II major histocompatibility complex gene expression in rat astrocytes, which in this system is initially induced by IFN-7. TNF-a exerts its effect by binding to high affinity TNF-a receptors on astrocytes, whose expression is also enhanced by IFN-7. These two cytokines work in concert to elevate class II expression on astrocytes, an event which can contribute to initiation and/or perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.",

Culture medium (CM) was Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM), high-glucose formula supplemented with glucose to a final concentration of 6 g/l, 2 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acid mixture, 0.1% gentamicin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, U.S.A.). Astrocytes were obtained after 10 days in primary culture, and were used up to the age of 10 weeks (70 days). Briefly, oligodendrocytes were separated from the astrocytes by mechanical dislodging, and then the astrocytes were obtained by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin-0.02% EDTA). The cells were counted using trypan blue; cell viability was 99-100%. The astrocytes were monitored for purity by immunofluorescence, and by nonspecific esterase staining for contaminating microglia as previously described (Benveniste and Merrill, 1986) . 5.0 \u00d7 10 4 primary astrocytes were plated on 12 mm glass coverslips, incubated in culture medium for 2 days, washed twice with PBS, and fixed for 10 s in cold acetone.

The coverslips were then mounted in 30% glycerol, and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Astrocyte cultures were routinely > 95% positive for GFAP, and less than 3% of the cells were microglia based on their positive staining for nonspecific esterase.",

This effect was seen in both serum-containing and serum-free media. Similar results were obtained with a 72 and 96 h incubation (data not shown). However, when added simultaneously with IFN-T, TNF-c~ at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 ng/ml significantly enhanced class II antigen expression (p < 0.001). Optimal expression was demonstrated using IFNq, at 20 U/ml and TNF-a at 50 ng/ml for 48 h (Fig. 1) . Comparable results were obtained when these same experiments were performed under serum-free conditions: 16.0% positive upon IFNq, stimulation and 40.0% positive upon stimulation with both TNF-a and IFN-,/. These findings indicate that the presence of serum does not interfere with or modulate class II antigen expression. Immunohistochemical staining for class II antigens was also performed on nontrypsinized astrocytes to compare with the FACS data. Similar results were obtained: 7-10% positive upon stimulation with IFNq,, and 40 47% positive with both IFN-T and TNF-a, indicating that the trypsinization procedure did not interfere with class II antigen expression. These results imply synergistic action of these two cytokines on rat astrocytes, especially as TNF-a alone has no effect on class II expression. The specificity of this synergistic response was investigated using antibodies against both IFN--/ and TNF-a. To determine whether the enhancement of IFN-'y-mediated class II antigen expression was indeed due to TNF-a, we attempted to abrogate the enhancing effect with an antibody to TNF-a. Table 2 shows that the inclusion of such an antibody essentially negates the enhancing activity of TNF-a, while not influencing the inductive effect of IFN-7 alone. The polyclonal antibody to TNF-a alone had no effect on class II antigen expression compared to culture media. Table 2 also demonstrates that the addition of a monoclonal antibody to IFN-3, abrogates IFN-,/induced class II expression as expected, and also inhibits the ability of TNF-a to amplify IFN-v-induced class II expression. The monoclonal antibody alone had no effect on class II antigen 213 expression compared to culture media. The data from Table 2 suggest that TNF-a is responsible for enhancing the ability of IFN-7, to induce class II antigens.",

As shown in Fig. 2A , pretreatment with IFN-'r augments the synergistic effect of TNF-a. This effect is most pronounced when the cultures are pretreated with IFN-3, for 12-24 h, with an 18 h preincubation being most effective. Pretreatment with IFN-'y for 48 h, however, results in a diminution of the synergistic effect of TNF-a, and in fact, is comparable with the IFN-T alone treatment. As shown in Fig. 2B , addition of TNF-c~ for 12-48 h prior to IFN-7 results in no synergistic effect, whereas a synergistic effect is observed only when TNF-a is added 3 and 6 h prior to IFNq,. This effect is, however, not as pronounced as that seen when the two cytokines are added simultaneously.

Treatment of astrocytes with IFN-7 increased specific binding of 12SI-TNF-c~ compared to untreated cells (Fig. 3) . Scatchard analysis of this data ( (Scatchard, 1949); Fig. 3, inset) indicates that incubation with IFN-y increases the number of specific TNF-a receptors (2650 receptors/untreated cell vs. 4800 receptors/IFNq,treated cell), but does not change the dissociation constant (Kd) (0.83 \u00d7 10 9 M/untreated cells vs. 0.87 \u00d7 10 9 M/IFN-y-treated cells). Table 3 contains data from three separate binding experiments, and illustrates that the increase in TNF-a receptors on IFN-y-treated astrocytes (3900 _+ 781) compared to untreated cells (2483 _+ 332) is significant (p < 0.05), with no significant change in binding affinity (Kd).

            "text": "A possible mechanism for the synergy between TNF-c~ and IFN-T could be increased TNF-~ receptor expression induced by IFN-T. This has been demonstrated to occur in other TNF-c~-responsive cells such as human colon carcinoma cell lines, HeLa cells, melanoma cells, and human cervical carcinoma cell lines (Aggarwal et al., 1985; Ruggiero et al., 1986; Tsujimoto et al., 1986) . To determine if TNF-c~ receptor expression was increased by IFN-T in primary rat astrocytes, we performed binding experiments on both untreated and IFN-T-treated astrocytes. Our data indicate that astrocytes incubated with IFN-y for 18-24 h express more TNF-c~ receptors (3900 +_ 781/ce11) than do untreated astrocytes (2483 _+ 332/ce11). The apparent binding affinity (Kd) calculated from these data was 0.71 \u00d7 10 9 M for IFN-Ttreated cells and 0.69 \u00d7 10 -9 M for untreated cells. These results demonstrate that treatment with IFN-T does not significantly change the binding affinity of TNF-c~ receptors, but increases their number per cell. TNF-c~ receptor expression is optimal after a 24 h incubation with IFN-T, and diminishes after a 48 h incubation. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that IFN-T increases the sensitivity of rat astrocytes to class II antigen amplification by TNF-c~ by inducing the synthesis of TNF-~ receptors. The kinetic data indicate that pretreatment with IFN-T for 12-24 h results in the most pronounced synergistic effect of IFN-T and TNF-c~, while a 48 h pretreatment with IFN-T prior to the addition of TNF-c~ does not culminate in synergistic activity between these two cytokines. Thus, it appears that the 'inductive signal' for TNF-c~ enhancement of class II antigen expression by IFN-T is, in part, increased TNF-c~ receptor expression. This is the first formal demonstration of biologically active TNF-c~ receptors on primary rat astrocytes and their modulation by the lymphokine IFN-T. The binding affinity of astrocyte TNF-a receptors is similar to those reported for other primary cells and cell lines, and indicates a single class of high affinity receptors. This increase in TNF-c~ receptors by IFN-T may well be the signal by which TNF-c~ asserts its biological effect in astrocytes with respect to class II antigen expression. As TNF-c~ alone can increase class I MHC expression in astrocytes (Lavi et al., 1988) , constitutively expressed TNF-c~ receptors also are biologically functional.",

Direct induction by neurotrophic viruses would represent one mechanism, and infiltration of activated T-lymphocytes from the periphery another. Pathological events within the CNS often result in the breakdown of the BBB, which would permit cells of the immune system to enter the CNS. Patients with various neurological diseases such as viral encephalitis and multiple sclerosis (MS) have inflammatory infiltrates composed of T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes, and macrophages in their brains (Traugott et al., 1983; Moench and Griffin, 1984) . Activated T-lymphocytes could provide an endogenous local source of IFN-T in the CNS, and thereby initiate class II antigen expression on astrocytes. Indeed, IFN-T has been localized in frozen sections of MS brain (Traugott and Lebon, 1988) , and the synthesis of IFN-T and IL-6 has been detected in the CNS during viral meningitis and encephalitis (Frei et al., 1988) . Once astrocytes express class II, they can now function as APC and induce further expansion of T-lymphocyte clones within the CNS. TNF-c~, 217 released by infiltrating macrophages or produced locally by activated astrocytes and/or microglia, can interact with class II-positive astrocytes previously activated by IFN-T and enhance class II MHC expression.",
