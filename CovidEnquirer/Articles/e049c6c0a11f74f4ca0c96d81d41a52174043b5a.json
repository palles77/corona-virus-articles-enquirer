To achieve these endeavors and enable the vision described above, the research community requires a major restructuring in the current research-funding policies through the development of innovative funding mechanisms that will provide long-term support for microbiome data science. Examples of such mechanisms can be drawn from existing models such as the Brain Initiative (https://www. whitehouse.gov/share/brain-initiative), a grand challenge research effort to revolutionize our understanding of the human brain. At the dawn of the third decade of microbial genomics, and well into the information age, the time is ripe to embark on the greatest endeavor to understand Earth's microbiome. Microbiome data science, through the establishment of a national microbiome data center, can pave the way. A recent study provides a platform for generating infectious coronavirus genomes using sequence data, examining their capabilities of replicating in human cells and causing diseases in animal models, and evaluating therapeutics and vaccines. Similar approaches could be used to assess the potential of human emergence and pathogenicity for other viruses.",

For the SARS epidemic, a total of >8000 laboratoryconfirmed cases with >800 deaths were observed (http://www.cdc.gov/sars/ about/fs-sars.html). This horrific epidemic was followed by the publication of >7500 scientific papers on CoVs visible in PubMed, which represents two-thirds of the total number of publications on CoVs in Pubmed.

The clone was shown to be able to generate infectious virus in primary human airway epithelial cell culture, confirming its ability to efficiently replicate in human cells. When the spike gene of WIV1-CoV was used to replace that of SARS-CoV MA15, a mouseadapted virus [7] , the resulting CoV did not replicate efficiently or cause disease in mice. However, if transgenic mice that expressed the ACE2 receptor were used, WIV1-CoV was able to replicate and cause weight loss.

However, they found that the antibodies generated by immunizing animals using inactivated SARS-CoV did not protect WIV1-CoV infection in aged mice.

Before the SARS epidemic, fewer than 10 CoVs with complete genome sequences were available. After the SARS epidemic, and up to March 2016, there was an addition of more than 40 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced. These CoVs include two human CoVs (HCoVs; HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) and at least 30 other mammalian and avian CoVs. Two additional lineages in Betacoronavirus and a novel genus, Deltacoronavirus, have been discovered [8, 9] . This diversity of coronaviruses is due to the infidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, their high frequencies of homologous RNA recombination, and their large genomes. CoVs are well known for the difficulties in culturing them, and most of the newly discovered CoVs are so far noncultivable. Just from the sequences of these CoVs, it is impossible to predict which one(s) may have the potential in causing the next epidemic. Synthetic full-DNA clones for these CoVs can be made, and systematic evaluation can be performed. Since betaCoVs, including HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, are the culprits of all large human epidemics, we should start the systematic evaluation by focusing on the betaCoVs.",

In recent years, multiple virusessuch as influenza viruses H5N1 and H7N9, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, Ebolavirus and Zika virushave emerged in humans. Some of them have apparently disappeared after the amplification host was segregated from humans, whereas others have persisted for years. Each of these viruses has a lot of closely related viruses or sequences obtained by either conventional sequencing or metagenomics approaches.

Recently, there has been much discussion and debate on the potential threats of gain-of-function experiments [10] . There are fears that accidental release of these 'super-virulent' viruses or their use as biological weapons may lead to uncontrollable epidemics. However, we believe that these gain-of-function experiments should not be banned because of the potential threats. By contrast, each experiment should be carefully examined for the potential benefits weighed against potential threats. In our opinion, the potential benefits are enormous, as exemplified by the works by Menachery et al. [1, 2] . It is the laboratory practice and conduct of the researchers that are most important in safeguarding any potential leakage of viruses. observed that WNV genetic divergence is dependent on the vector mosquito species. This suggests that specific WNV vector-bird species pairings may generate novel genotypes that could promote outbreaks.",

Zika (ZIKV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and West Nile (WNV) viruses have recently emerged in new regions of the world to cause significant human disease. Despite garnering less media attention recently than ZIKV and CHIKV, WNV remains an important public health threat to the USA, and, unlike ZIKV and CHIKV, has established local transmission and continues to cause epidemics across the continental USA every summer since it was introduced in 1999. In fact, the ongoing WNV epidemic has resulted in the largest domestic arboviral neuroinvasive disease outbreak on record, causing 16000 cases with more than 1600 deaths [1] . However, in contrast to ZIKV and CHIKV that use humans as amplifying hosts and two primary urban mosquito vectors, WNV uses several avian species as amplifying hosts and at least four major vector mosquito species [1] . The ability of WNV to infect many species suggests this virus is especially capable of surviving unique evolutionary pressures compared to more host-restricted arboviruses that use fewer host species. Despite this, the effects of catholic host specificity on WNV evolution and emergence have been poorly studied to date.",

The goal was to assess how WNV populations evolve in different mosquito vectors. The four species were fed the same WNV-spiked bloodmeal and then midguts (representing infection), legs (disseminated infections), salivary glands, and saliva (transmission) from infected mosquitoes were analyzed to study intratissue WNV population structure. Predictably, individuals of all four species with more WNV genomes were more likely to transmit WNV. What was less predictable, and also novel to this study, is that the intrahost population structure was unique to each mosquito species. Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. tarsalis developed more",

Although the majority of mutations probably hurt the virus, being mutable also allows arboviruses to adapt to new settings when mutations at minority frequencies in populations are positively selected in new or different environments and rise to dominate the population. In addition to helping the virus survive disparate vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, positively selected mutations can also promote an increase in disease.Advances in deep sequencing have enabled genome characterization, revealing that intrahost arbovirus populations in humans or birds and mosquitoes are different[3][4][5]. However, viral population dynamics within mosquito vectors are poorly understood for any given vector, and no studies have compared viral populations across vector species. For WNV, genetic variation could allow the virus to successfully traverse different adaptive landscapes presented by its many bird and mosquito hosts. Recent studies with CHIKV showed that what goes into the mosquito does not always reflect what comes out during re-feeding. Mutations that only dominate populations in saliva may enhance vector transmissibility[6], a factor that could promote further CHIKV spread and contribute to explosive outbreaks. However, similar studies have not been performed for WNV, including using different species that represent the range of primary vectors the virus uses.",
