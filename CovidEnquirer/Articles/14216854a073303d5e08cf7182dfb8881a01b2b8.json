            "text": "A disease known as covert mortality disease has become an increasing problem in the shrimp farming industry in recent years in China and several countries of Southeast Asia, leading to serious losses in production. Litopenaeus vannamei (also known as Pacific white shrimp) is affected by this disease that leads to a range of clinical symptoms including hepatopancreas atrophy and necrosis, soft shell, slow growth, and abdominal muscle whitening and necrosis in the acute stage of disease. A new nodavirus, termed covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV), has been shown to be the etiological agent. In this study, we report a sensitive and specific real-time reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the rapid and quantitative detection of CMNV. The optimal conditions for this newly developed RT-LAMP reaction were found to be 6 mM MgCl 2 and 1.6 mM dNTPs, an incubation temperature of 65\u00b0C and a reaction time of 50 min. The analytical sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay was estimated to be 6.3 pg total RNA of CMNV-infected shrimp and 27 copies of the target plasmid. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the newly developed assay versus the standard nested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay was 96.4% and 94.4%, respectively. The reaction products were detected by visual inspection after staining with an in-tube DNA fluorescent dye, a measure taken to eliminate the risk of contamination. The quantitative RT-LAMP assay for CMNV showed high correlation coefficient (r 2 = 0.9953) when the initial templates were above 1000 copies, however the correlation coefficient decreased when the initial templates were lower than 1000 copies. Test of viral load in shrimp indicated that the viral loads varied from 1.5 \u00c2 10 2 to 6.7 \u00c2 10 6 copies per mg of cephalothorax tissue. Thus, the CMNV RT-LAMP assay is a sensitive and specific new tool for the field detection and quantification of CMNV in the diagnosis and surveillance of covert mortality disease.",

            "text": "Litopenaeus vannamei, also known as Pacific white shrimp, is an economically important variety of shrimp. However, production of L. vannamei is limited by its susceptibility to various diseases. In China, covert mortality disease (CMD) has been reported in pond cultures of L. vannamei recently (Xu and Ji, 2009; Zhang et al., 2014) . The epidemiology study proved the prevalence of CMD in shrimp ponds in Thailand, Indonesia, India and Ecuador (Flegel, 2014) . Typical clinical signs of CMD in the shrimp include hepatopancreas atrophy and necrosis, soft shell, slow growth, and abdominal muscle whitening and necrosis in the acute stage (Gu, 2012; Huang, 2012; Zhang, 2004; Zhang et al., 2014) . The symptom of abdominal muscle whitening and necrosis is similar to the symptoms reported in the early stages of disease caused by infectious myonecrosis virus (IMNV) and Penaeus vannamei nodavirus (PvNV) in the shrimp. However, these diseases can be distinguished by RT-PCR (Zhang et al., 2014) . CMD-related mortality has been found to be sporadic, and may be increased by environmental stress, such as high temperature. When the water temperature rises above 28\u00b0C, survival in infected ponds decreases sharply and the cumulative mortality rate of shrimps infected by CMD has been reported to be up to 80% (Gu, 2012; Xing, 2004; Xu and Ji, 2009 A range of techniques were employed to identify the etiological agent of CMD including histopathology, virion purification, sequence analysis, experimental infection, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. A new nodavirus, designated as covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV) (Zhang et al., 2014) , was found to be the causative agent of CMD. Like other members of the genus Alphanodavirus, the genome of CMNV is a positive single-stranded RNA. Histological examination of the diseased L. vannamei shrimp revealed atrophied, structurally discorded, hepatopancreas tubules and coagulative necrosis of skeletal muscle. Eosinophilic inclusions were detected in the hepatopancreas and lymphoid organ (Zhang et al., 2014) . Specimens of the main economic species of shrimp in China, Fenneropenaeus chinensis (Chinese white shrimp) and Marsupenaeus japonicus (Japanese tiger prawn), were also found to be infected by CMNV in an epidemiological investigation conducted using histological examination and RT-PCR for virus detection (Zhang et al., 2014) . Therefore, the risk of a CMNV pandemic in both farmed and wild shrimp is substantial.",

The results showed that the amplification occurred earlier when the reaction was incubated at 65\u00b0C compared with the other incubation temperatures (Fig. 1A) . Experiments to optimize the concentrations of MgCl 2 and dNTPs showed that the smallest average Ct value (22.38) was generated when the concentrations of MgCl 2 and dNTPs were 4.0 mM and 1.4 mM, respectively. However, the smallest average Ct value was accompanied by a standard error of 0.65, indicating substantial fluctuations in amplification efficiency. Meanwhile, the third smallest Ct value (23.31), with the smallest standard error of 0.04, was obtained when the concentrations of MgCl 2 and dNTPs were 6.0 mM and 1.6 mM, respectively. Therefore, the optimal concentrations of MgCl 2 and dNTPs were determined to be 6.0 mM and 1.6 mM, respectively. The real-time kinetics of the RT-LAMP reaction, with or without loop primers, was analyzed with 6.0 mM of MgCl 2 , 1.6 mM of dNTPs and incubation at 65\u00b0C. The results indi-cated that the time required for initiation of amplification was 29.6 min with loop primers or 46.5 min without loop primers, which indicated that using loop primers accelerated the amplification, thereby reducing the detection time, compared with RT-LAMP without loop primers. Based on these findings, further RT-LAMP assays were incubated for 50 min at 65\u00b0C with 6 mM MgCl 2 and 1.6 mM dNTPs.",

At the end of the reaction, the dye was incorporated into the reaction mixture by shaking, allowing for the visual inspection of the RT-LAMP products. The use of a fluorescent dye can therefore substitute for gel electrophoresis or realtime PCR as a method of viral detection, simplifying the assay and reducing the contamination risk.",

Based on the standard curve, an equation was calculated using regression analysis comparing Ct values with the standard copy number. In the range of 10 8 -10 3 plasmid copies, the correlation coefficient was high (r 2 = 0.9953), which indicates that qRT-LAMP is appropriate as a quantitation tool. However, when the plasmid copy number decreased to less than 1000 copies, the correlation coefficient also decreased significantly, which confirmed the findings of previous reports that it is difficult to determine the exact correlation of the initial template quantity and the Ct value at very low concentrations of template (Mori et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2013) .",
