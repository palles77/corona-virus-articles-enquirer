In 2004, an atypical pestivirus was isolated from a contaminated batch of calf serum originating from Brazil. This virus, named D32/00_HoBi, was proposed as prototype of a new pestivirus species, BVDV-3 (3) . Although additional HoBi-like strains have been detected in South America (4), currently, there is a unique report of natural infection in cattle caused by a HoBi-like strain, Th/04_KhonKaen, which was isolated from a bovine serum sample collected during an epidemiologic survey for BVDV in Thailand (5). However, the virus was not associated with any evident clinical signs. Here we report the biologic and genetic characterization of a HoBi-like strain from Europe that was isolated from cattle during an outbreak of respiratory disease in Italy.",

At the genetic level, the HoBi-like strain from Italy was more strictly related to the viruses from Brazil than to the isolate from Thailand. Considering that the virus has been repeatedly detected in batches of fetal calf serum (3, 11) , a possible introduction of the virus to the European continent through vaccines or other products prepared with contaminated bovine serum should be taken into account. Accordingly, previous reports suggest that BVDV may spread (and cause severe disease) through vaccination with contaminated products (12) (13) (14) . By phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome and E2 and N pro regions, atypical pestiviruses formed a monophyletic cluster that was approximately equidistant from BVDV-1/BVDV-2 and BDV/CSFV, whereas the dendrogram obtained from 5\u2032 UTR showed a closer relatedness to BVDVs. Thus, phylogeny may not support naming HoBi-like strains as BVDV-3 because the proposed nomenclature (8, 10) does not refl ect the genetic relationship among different pestivirus species.",

This difference also was evident in this study in that experimentally infected calves displayed high antibody titers by virus neutralization with the homologous virus, whereas only titers slightly above the cutoff were obtained by a commercial BVDV-1-based ELISA. The genetic and antigenic differences between HoBi-like strains and BVDV-1/BVDV-2 pose intriguing questions about the effi cacy of commercially available BVDV vaccines and the need to develop specifi c vaccines against this new virus. In addition, BVDV surveillance programs may be affected by the poor sensitivity of commonly used PCRs with respect to atypical pestiviruses because of their genetic distance from BVDVs. Continuous Table were used. Asterisks indicate strong statistical support for a node by a bootstrap value of 75%-100%. Scale bars represent estimated numbers of nucleotide substitutions per site.
