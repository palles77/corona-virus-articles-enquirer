In a study from our ED-based SARS screening clinic during the outbreak in Hong Kong (which included afebrile patients), it was shown that 19% of SARS patients initially presented without fever, and that radiographic evidence of pneumonia often preceded fever. 5 Therefore, a more useful tool for mass screening would have included fever or body temperature as a variable, thus allowing the evaluation of afebrile cases. 2 Furthermore, the study of Wang et al 3 actually enrolled only those cases that met the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for suspected SARS. Although their scoring system was shown to have a sensitivity of 100%, this perfect figure will apply only specifically to those patients already screened as positive by the WHO criteria or case definition. Unfortunately, the WHO criteria for suspected SARS have been shown to have a sensitivity of only 26%. 5 In practice, therefore, if 100 SARS patients presented to the ED for screening, only 26 would be correctly triaged to undergo the scoring system evaluation. Thus, relying on this strategy, despite the implementation of a near-perfect decision rule, will still result in an unacceptable number of missed cases.",

Actually, California has a more generous standard for ED access than the conventional prudent layperson standard, wherein the law states that a health plan (excepting Kaiser) must pay for emergency care unless ''the patient should have known that they did not have an emergency.'' 2 This language is uniquely subjective in that it refers to the patient's frame of mind rather than to ''the opinion of a prudent layperson.'' Because it would be very difficult to prove a negative on the basis of what the patient should have known, the frequency of denials should have been much lower if these plans were obeying the law.",

The inference is that the practice of pre-authorization for ED visits was abandoned because it wasn't useful, or perhaps that it was unsafe or inaccurate per the references cited. On the contrary, managed care gatekeeping was primarily abandoned not because it lacked utility for health plans, but because of complaints and regulatory activity instigated by providers and consumers. For example, prior authorization in the ED was prohibited after emergency physicians in California convinced the Office of Inspector General that it was a violation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. 4 These comments illustrate the importance of placing socioeconomic data in the appropriate historical and legal context.
