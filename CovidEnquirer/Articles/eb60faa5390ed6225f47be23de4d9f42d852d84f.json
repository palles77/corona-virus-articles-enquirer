The decahydroisoquinolin scaffold has been demonstrated to be an effective hydrophobic center to interact with S2 site of SARS 3CL pro , but the lack of interactions at S3 to S4 site is thought to be a major reason for the moderate inhibitory activity. In this study, the effects of an additional non-prime site substituent on the scaffold as well as effects of several warheads are evaluated. For the introduction of a desired non-prime site substituent, amino functionality was introduced on the decahydroisoquinolin scaffold, and the scaffold was constructed by Pd(II) catalyzed diastereoselective ring formation. The synthesized decahydroisoquinolin inhibitors showed about 2.4 times potent inhibitory activities for SARS 3CL pro when combined with a non-prime site substituent. The present results indicated not only the expected additional interactions with the SARS 3CL pro but also the possibility of new inhibitors containing a fused-ring system as a hydrophobic scaffold and a new warhead such as thioacetal.",

[4] [5] [6] The polyprotein contains a 3C-like cysteine protease (SARS 3CL pro ) which can process the polyprotein to provide a variety of proteins necessary to re-construct the virus particle. Thus, the SARS 3CL pro is indispensable for viral replication but not found in the host cell, which makes the SARS 3CL pro an ideal target for antiviral agents. Numerous studies on substrate-peptide-based and non-peptide inhibitors for SARS 3CL pro have been reported, 7, 8 but no therapeutic agents are available at present.",

These results suggest that the cyclohexyl ring might be connected to the peptide chain by a methylene linker, yielding a new non-peptide inhibitor scaffold containing a hydrophobic decahydroisoquinolin ring. The resulting decahydroisoquinolin-type inhibitor 2 was synthesized and confirmed to be an inhibitor as expected, but the potency was moderate (IC 50 = 63 \u03bcM). 11 The X-ray crystal structure analyses of inhibitor 2 complexed with R188I SARS 3CL pro revealed the lack of interactions covering the P3 to P4 sites of substrate-based inhibitor 1, which suggest that these missing interactions at non-prime sites might be a major reason of the moderate inhibitory activity of 2.",

With regard to the configuration of the amino group at the 4-position, a preliminary overlay of inhibitor 1 and 2 ( Fig. 2) did not eliminate either diastereomer as a non-interacting inhibitor compared with the other, although the 4-S configuration was expected to be preferable. Thus, a synthetic route applicable for the construction of both configurations at the 4-position was employed. P1 site His residue is condensed by reductive-amination via an aldehyde introduced by oxidative cleavage of a terminal olefin at 3-position of decahydroisoquinolin ring of 4. The key intermediate 4 is synthesized from a precursor 5 by Pd(II) catalyzed diastereoselective cyclization. 12, 13 The selectivity and efficiency have been well established by our previous syntheses of decahydroisoquinolin scaffold 11 and natural products containing piperidine 14 and pyrrolidine 15 scaffolds. As an acyl substituent of an amino group, the 4-bromobenzoyl group was selected owing to the expected additional interactions with SARS 3CL pro , as inhibitors containing 4-halogenated benzoyl substituents exhibited better inhibitory activities than those containing 4-phenyl substituted benzoyl substituents in our previous study. 11 Precursor 5 can be synthesized by conventional homologation and acylation reactions from 6. Amino functional group of 6 is stereoselectively introduced by Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation 16 followed by Mitsunobu reaction, 17 using a commercially available diol compound 7.",

One primary alcohol of 14 was protected as an acetonide and the other alcohol was converted to an amine as above by Mitsunobu reaction and following catalytic hydrogenation.

The substitution position was selected by overlay of a substrate-based inhibitor and the fused-ring inhibitor. The inhibitor 26 was synthesized using Pd(II) catalyzed diastereoselective cyclization as a key reaction. Synthesized inhibitor 26 showed a clear but moderate inhibitory activity for R188I SARS 3CL pro . The results strongly suggested increased interactions of inhibitor 26 with SARS 3CL pro at S3 to S4 pocket, although the interactions were expected to be insufficient. Thus, detailed analyses of the interactions based on X-ray crystal analyses of 26 complexed with R188I SARS 3CL pro are the next objects. In addition, it was demonstrated that a thioacetal warhead would be an alternative warhead to aldehyde, which has rather high reactivity causing a possibility of non-selective interactions with proteins. The present data suggested that a combination of thioacetal functional group with decahydroisoquinolin or related fused-ring scaffold would be another approach to design novel inhibitors for SARS 3CL protease, and studies on this line are now underway.",

These models were constructed based on the estimated maximum stabilization structure.fragment were condensed with a cyclized product 17 (Scheme 6). The Boc group of 17 was removed by HCl and the resulting amine was coupled with P1 fragment 22 using BOP 21 as a coupling reagent. A terminal olefin of the product 23 was oxidized with O 3 and an aldehyde of the product was reductively coupled with P1 fragment 21b to give 24b. Removal of the Trt group at the His-imidazole of 24b was conducted by the treatment with TFA:TIS:CH 2 Cl 2 :H 2 O = 10:1:10:1 to yield 25b quantitatively. To evaluate the effect of warheads on the inhibitory activity, P1 fragment 21a and H-His(Trt)-N(OMe)Me were similarly coupled with 23 to yield 25a and 25c, respectively. Brief treatment of 25b with NBS 22 converted the thioacetal to an aldehyde and the product was purified by preparative HPLC to give 26 in high homogeneity (Fig. S-2).",
