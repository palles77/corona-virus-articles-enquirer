We performed a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials to estimate the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of acute bronchitis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: English-language studies published January 1966 to April 1998 were retrieved using MEDLINE, bibliographies, and consultation with experts. Only randomized trials that enrolled otherwise healthy patients with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, used an antibiotic in the treatment group and a placebo in the control group, and provided sufficient data to calculate an effect size were included. RESULTS: We identified eight randomized controlled trials that satisfied all inclusion criteria. These studies used one of three antibiotics (erythromycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole). The use of antibiotics decreased the dura-tion of cough and sputum production by approximately onehalf day (summary effect size 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.36). For specific symptoms, there were nonsignificant trends favoring the use of antibiotics: a decrease of 0.4 days of purulent sputum (95% CI, \u03ea0.1 to 0.8), a decrease of 0.5 days of cough (95% CI, \u03ea0.1 to 1.1), and a decrease of 0.3 days lost from work (95% CI, \u03ea0.6 to 1.1). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests a small benefit from the use of the antibiotics erythromycin, doxycycline, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy patients. As this small benefit must be weighed against the risk of side effects and the societal cost of increasing antibiotic resistance, we believe that the use of antibiotics is not justified in these patients.

This definition excludes patients with acute exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disorders, in whom a previous meta-analysis found that antibiotic use led to a small, statistically significant benefit (1) . The effectiveness of antibiotics in patients with acute bronchitis remains uncertain, although the disorder is the tenth most common diagnosis seen by physicians in the United States, accounting for 10 million office visits annually (2) .",

Most studies have identified viruses (adenovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and coxsackievirus) as the cause in the majority of patients (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) . Atypical bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella species, have been reported to cause 5% to 25% of cases of acute bronchitis (15) (16) (17) , and typical bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis) have been recovered from the sputum in 7% to 44% of patients (8, 18, 19) . However, the importance of positive bacterial cultures from sputum is not known, because many of these pathogens are part of the oropharyngeal flora (3,9,20 -22) . Recent evidence suggests that some bronchitis in adults may be caused by Bordetella pertussis and parapertussis, which are better known for their role in causing whooping cough in children (23) .",

For studies that did not include the outcome \"days of sputum production,\" we chose the outcome in the study that was the most clinically similar (sputum production score, cough amount score). We transformed each outcome into units of standard deviation, thus giving a comparable effect size for different outcomes. The study-specific effect size was the difference in the mean outcome for the antibiotic and placebo groups, divided by the pooled standard deviation of the outcome measure in that study. The summary effect size across studies was calculated as a weighted average of the study-specific effect sizes, with weights equal to the inverse of the estimated variance. The significance of the summary effect size, standardized by its estimated variance, was assessed by comparing it with the standard normal distribution. A test for heterogeneity was calculated by comparing the weighted average of the squared differences between summary and study-specific effect sizes with an appropriate X 2 distribution, with the same weights being used. These calculations used standard formulas (44) , which assume that the outcomes are normally distributed and the sample sizes are approximately equal in the antibiotic and placebo groups.",

Of the eight trials included in our meta-analysis, four showed no benefit from the use of antibiotics (32) (33) (34) 36) , whereas four reported a benefit (29, 30, 35, 37) . Part of the discrepancy may be because studies used different outcome measures, some of which are of uncertain clinical importance. For example, the outcome measures in one trial that reported a statistically significant benefit from antibiotics included a reduction in mean temperature from 37.3\u040aC to 36.9\u040aC and a reduction in the use of antihistamines (30) . Because the published trials used several outcome measures, we used the standardized effect size, expressed in units of standard deviation, to quantitate the overall effect of antibiotic therapy. We chose the outcome that is most characteristic of acute bronchitis (days of sputum production) in the six studies where it was available, and we used the most similar outcome in the two other studies (cough amount score, sputum production score). We found a small, statistically significant benefit to the use of antibiotics in patients with acute bronchitis approximately equal to one-fifth of a standard deviation unit. To relate the observed benefit in the summary effect size to clinical variables, we also calculated summary mean differences for all outcomes that were reported by at least four trials (duration of sputum production, duration of cough, and days lost from work), all of which showed small, nonsignificant trends favoring the use of antibiotics. Our meta-analysis suggests that patients with acute bronchitis who are treated with antibiotics have a reduction in the duration of cough and sputum production of approximately one half day.",

Furthermore, side effects of antibiotics used for acute bronchitis are common, occurring in 10% to 36% of patients (28 -31,33,35,37) .

Others have suggested treating patients who test positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae (39) , although there is no evidence from randomized trials to support this practice. In a randomized trial using erythromycin to treat acute bronchitis, King et al (37) found no difference in outcomes between patients who tested positive and those who tested negative for Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

In healthy patients with acute bronchitis who have no evidence of chronic pulmonary disease, we believe that the small benefit associated with antibiotic treatment does not outweigh the risk of side effects and the increase in antibiotic resistance.",
