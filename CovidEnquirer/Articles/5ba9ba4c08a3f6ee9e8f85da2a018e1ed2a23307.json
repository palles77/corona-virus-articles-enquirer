Nestboxes made out of wood are advisable as they absorb the moisture better. The nest-box should be placed higher in the cage than natural sleeping sites. It also has to be large enough to allow all animals of the group to sleep in it. If animals need to be caught regularly, it is worth using nest-boxes that can be closed by a sliding door in order to catch them inside. If possible, cages should have a maximum of furnishing that accommodates callitrichid locomotion and behaviour. Branches have to be placed in both horizontal and vertical lanes and can be either fixed or swinging. Runways on branches can be connected with ropes or hose pipes.

Garber (1992) reported that marmosets spend 30-70% of their feeding time on exudates like gum arabic, with their specially adapted lower anterior dentition and V-shaped mandible. Because of their \"long-tusked\" dentition, tamarins are called opportunistic exudate eaters which benefit from the bark gouging of marmosets (Ferrari and Martins, 1992) . The National Research Council (NRC) recommendations (2003) state that diet of tamarins should consist of 45% insects, 35% fruits, 10% exudates, 7% nectar and 3% seeds, whereas marmosets eat 45% exudates, 16% fruits, 39% insects. Gum arabic provides the marmosets with a source of complex polysaccharides and carbohydrates, certain minerals, especially calcium (Carroll, 1997) , and tannin. Trials, in different callitrichid species, with two different diets with or without gum arabic, showed that the addition of gum slowed the gut passage rate in marmosets, without depressing the digestive efficiency (Power and Oftedal, 1996) . Marmosets are able to ferment tree exudates with the help of micro-organisms in their bigger cecum (Ferarri and Martins, 1992) .",

Callitrichids are the only simian primates with multiple ovulation. Births usually comprise twins, but increasingly triplets or even quadruplets in captivity. Shortly after birth, and despite lactation, callitrichids ovulate (8 to 18 days post-partum) and can conceive again. In cotton-top tamarins, Ziegler et al. (1987) determined different post-partum ovulation periods depending on litter size: 27.3 \u00b1 1 days after the birth of twins and only 16 \u00b1 0.75 days after giving birth to a singleton.

In immature females, pregnancy may restrict normal growth and very young mothers more often fail to rear their first offspring. It is advisable to place the new pair away from their natal groups in order to prevent stress and the suppression of ovarian cycles by the mother. Infants are carried by all members of the family, but participation varies between the different species. This co-operative rearing system is important for the breeding success of the offspring. Hearn and Burden (1979) developed a rotation system of collaborative rearing of marmoset triplets without depriving them of the maternal and family influence. If available, a foster mother can also raise the new-borns, after marking the babies with urine of the new mother prior to presentation. Infants start to eat solid food from week 3-4, stealing the food from the mouths of family members. At the age of 90 days, infants are completely weaned. Twin fights can be observed with a higher incidence at the age of eight months. Offspring should be removed from their family at the age of eighteen months.",

It produces severe ulceration in the facial area, oral cavity and oesophagus and can lead to death within 48 hours with an incubation period of seven days. Many facilities therefore recommend that people with cold sores should not work with the animals. The reservoir host for Herpes tamarinus is the Squirrel monkey. It is transmitted via saliva, bite wounds, capture nets and gloves. After an incubation period of 7-10 days, the animals develop multiple ulcerations of lips, eyes and oesophagus and nasal discharge, apathy and anorexia, death occurring from between 2 and 3 days. Callitrichids and cebids should therefore not be housed together (King, 1967) . Herpes saguinus was described by Melendez (1971) as not leading to clinical symptoms. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), which occurs very often as a latent infection in Old World Primates (OWP), seems not to be relevant in marmosets, and has been isolated from the salivary gland of tamarins without clinical symptoms (Nigida et al., 1979) . Herpes saimiri is latent in Squirrel monkeys without symptoms but leads to malignant lymphomas in callitrichids and Old World Primates. Herpes ateles is also known to produce lymphomas. Inoculation with Varicella zoster evokes delayed antibody titres but no clinical symptoms. Epstein-Barr-Virus is an established animal model in callitrichids but it does not occur naturally.

This Morbillivirus infection starts with swollen eyelids, fever, nasal discharge, facial oedema and exanthema, ending up with interstitial pneumonia. Secondary complications include septicaemia, abortion, metritis, severe dysentery and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Human measles vaccine and gamma globulin can be used prophylactically. Christe et al. (2002) immunised juvenile rhesus monkeys successfully with a canine distemper vaccine. The incubation period for Hepatitis A Virus, a picornavirus, is 30-40 days but animals do not develop clinical symptoms. It is of more importance as an anthropozoonosis, transmitted via urine or faeces, and personnel should be vaccinated. Callitrichid Hepatitis Virus (CHV), transmitted by mice, is closely related to the murine Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV). Clinical findings are anorexia, lethargy and dyspnoea and levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are elevated. Outbreaks in different colonies have shown that it is connected with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality (Asper et al., 2001; Montali et al., 1993) .",

Antibiotic treatment with Doxycycline works well. Vaccination is indicated if there is a manifest infection in the colony (Brack et al., 1997) . Campylobacter spp. is one of the most frequently isolated organisms from NHP with diarrhoea, or even from asymptomatic animals. Campylobacter jejuni is a cause of diarrhoea and enterocolitis in tamarins (Paul-Murphy, 1993) producing yellowish, soft mucoid faeces that can also contain occult blood. Faecal-oral route is the primary mode of transmission. It is of higher prevalence in wild caught animals and is a sign of poor hygiene in captivity (Gozalo et al., 1991) . Erythromycin is the antibiotic of choice (Johnson et al., 2001) . Brack et al. (1998) reported cases of Erysipelothrix insidiosa septicaemia in red bellied tamarins and common marmosets. Pathological lesions were gastrointestinal haemorrhages, hepatitis and myocarditis. A vaccination with porcine Erysipelothrix insisdiosa vaccine terminated the infection. Pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli are an important cause of diarrhoea although not well documented as a cause of diarrhoea in NHP. The enteropathogenic (EPEC) strain induces watery, non inflammatory, non bloody diarrhoea while the EHEC (enterohaemorrhagic) strain induces life-threatening haemorrhagic diarrhoea due to the production of a shiga-like toxin, associated with anaemia and neutrophilic leucocytosis . Animals become anorexic, inactive, lethargic and develop a recognised clinical dehydration (Mansfield et al., 2001) . Treatments are Enrofloxacine and supportive fluids.",

It may be related to stress, malnutrition (e.g. protein deficiency, too much fruit in the diet), parasitic, bacterial or viral infections or colitis. Clinical symptoms are rapid weight loss (>30% of LBW/week), dull fur, alopecia, particularly on the tail and breast, muscle atrophy, diarrhoea or obstipation colitis. Clinical pathology includes normochromic anaemia, thrombocytosis, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels (Logan and Khan, 1996; Tucker, 1984) . Lewis et al. (1987) compared the faecal microflora of healthy marmosets with animals who developed WMS. The latter showed an increase of bacteriodes and fewer lactobacilli. The value of dietary lactobacilli in NHP is a largely unexplored area. A chronic inflammation may be the primary insult in the development of WMS in many marmosets. Treatment with antibiotics and supportive care with fluids, immune modulators, Vitamin D 3 and Calcium, Ensure \u00ae , Nutri-Cal \u00ae may help.",
