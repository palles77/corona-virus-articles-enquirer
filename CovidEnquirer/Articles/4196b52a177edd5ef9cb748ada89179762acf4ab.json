Infection with a variety of viral strains including those of both high (H5 and H7; HPAI) and low pathogenicity occur frequently in farmed ostriches in South Africa (Abolnik et al., 2016) . Outbreaks are thought to result from exposure to wild birds. Clinical signs and pathology associated with AIV in ostriches in natural outbreaks and with experimental infection are variable. Mortality can be up to 100% and is dependent on age, virus strain, and secondary infections (Allwright, 1996; Capua et al., 2000; Cooper et al., 2007) . Chicks and juvenile birds are more susceptible to infection and develop more significant clinical disease than adults, who frequently appear unaffected. Clinical signs include anorexia, depression, and poor growth rates as well as green discoloration of the urine (biliverdinuria), swelling of the throat and neck, ocular discharge and sneezing and evidence of respiratory difficulty. Gross necropsy findings are nonspecific and can include serous atrophy of fat and muscle atrophy; luminal bile and bile staining of the upper gastrointestinal tract; hepatic bile stasis; congestion and mottling of the liver, spleen, kidneys, trachea and lungs; epicardial hemorrhages; and intestinal congestion to severe hemorrhagic enteritis. Histologic lesions also vary and include multifocal to diffuse necrosis of liver, spleen, and kidneys with a heterophilic response; pancreatic hemorrhage and necrosis with mononuclear cell inflammation; fibrinoid arteriolar necrosis and inflammation, particularly in spleen and brain; interstitial pneumonia; mild to marked air sacculitis; multifocal malacia and neuronophagia in the brain; and necrosis and hemorrhage in the intestine, particularly in the duodenum. Both gross and histologic lesions are affected by the presence of secondary infections, which have been prevalent in several reports. Infection with low patho-genic avian influenza viruses results in primarily a mild respiratory disease, with a reduction in egg production (Cooper et al., 2007) .",

Outbreaks are frequent in young chicks (e.g., brooder pneumonia). Clinical signs and gross and pathologic lesions are similar to those in any avian species and include pale gray to yellow nodules and plaques in the lungs and air sacs ( Fig. 26.13 ). Histopathologic lesions are typical for avian aspergillosis, with central areas of necrosis that contain parallel-walled, dichotomously branching, fungal hyphae and conidia (at air interfaces) and are surrounded by heterophilic and granulomatous inflammation with multinucleate giant cells and (in chronic lesions) an outer layer of fibroblasts or granulation tissue. Fungal elements are often easily identified with routine hematoxylin and eosin staining; silver or PAS stains highlight the organisms. Aspergillus spp. have also been reported as the cause of dermatitis in ostriches. Lesions can be localized or extensive ( Kuttin and Perelman, 1996) . Regardless of site, fungal culture is confirmatory and PCR can be used for additional characterization and differentiation of species. Predisposing factors to infection include contamination of eggs and hatcheries, overwhelming exposure to fungal spores through contaminated feed and bedding, and immunosuppression; high humidity and/or poor hygiene were associated husbandry conditions in cutaneous aspergillosis. Infection of the upper digestive tract; the oral cavity, pharynx, and esophagus, by opportunistic yeasts is reported frequently in ostrich chicks and is primarily associated with Candida spp. Proliferative and necrotizing lesions containing intralesional 3-5 \u00b5m diameter yeast and interspersed nonseptate pseudohyphae or hyphae are characteristic. Organisms can be highlighted in histologic section with either silver or PAS staining.

Birds are commonly simultaneously infected with more than one species of parasite. Four Eimeria species have been described and additional species are suspected to occur in the North Island brown kiwi (Morgan et al., 2017) . One species, Eimeria kiwi is present in the intestinal epithelium. An unusual feature of infection is the presence of large macromeronts (Morgan et al., 2012) (Fig. 26.15 ). Other identified species include E. parairii (suspected to play a role in the development of colorectal polyps), E. mantelli (has been identified in feces but has not yet been associated with clinical disease), and E. apteryxii (causes renal coccidiosis in the North Island brown kiwi, rowi, and tokoeka) (Morgan et al., 2012 (Morgan et al., , 2017 Thompson and Wright, 1978) . Additionally, asexual stages of unknown coccidial species have been found in the liver, spleen, lung, and pancreas. Periodic acid Schiff staining of kidney to enhance parasite recognition is recommended as part of routine histopathologic examination (Morgan et al., 2013) . Eimeriosis has also been described in red-winged tinamous. Infection with the causative agent, E. rhynchoti, caused apathy and maldigested, fetid, pasty feces as well as duodenal hemorrhage and thickening (Freitas et al., 2006; Marques et al. 2012) . Experimentally infected birds died between 1 and 6 days of patent infection.",

A wide range of Salmonella spp. has been identified in or from ratites, likely reflecting local sources of infection. Description of disease resulting from S. pullorum is notable by its absence, although seropositivity has been identified. Experimental infection of emu with S. pullorum resulted in seroconversion but no evidence of organ infection or shedding. Seroconversion also occurred in experimentally infected ostriches, with 1/8 birds developing lesions from which S. pullorum was reisolated. Salmonella spp. can be important causes of embryo death. Clinical and pathologic scenarios associated with salmonellosis include acute death and more chronic disability; omphalitis; yolk sacculitis; oophoritis (S. arizonae); necrotizing enteritis, typhlitis, and colitis; hepatitis; and pneumonia. A rectal stricture, identical to the lesion associated with salmonellosis in pigs, was described in an adult ostrich; however, no Salmonella sp. was isolated. Although frequently described as an uncommon disease, the frequently of description makes one wonder whether the condition is particularly uncommon. Disease reports involve captive animals, with the exception of diagnoses in wild southern cassowary in Australia. Gross lesions are as per other avian species: granulomatous nodules particularly in spleen, liver, abdominal serosa, and intestine and cloaca that frequently have an ulcerated mucosal surface. Areas of predilection also appear to be the ocular conjunctiva, the oropharynx in association with the pharyngeal tonsils, and subcutaneously at the base of the neck. Granulomatous nodules can be very large, for example, 30 cm in diameter or 2 kg in mass. The microscopic appearance is consistent with that in most avian species, small lesions are frequently composed of solid sheets of epithelioid macrophages whereas in larger lesions a central, caseonecrotic core without mineralization, and surrounded by fibrous connective tissue is more common. Langhan's type multinucleated giant cells, macrophages, heterophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells can all be present in varying combinations. The number of acid-fast organisms present can vary tremendously. Standard methods of culture and molecular characterization of organisms are appropriate. Mycobacterium avium is the most commonly identified species; however, a single case of M. bovis was identified in an ostrich.",

Ms02. zz,aaa Ostrich (Republic of Africa)In 2004, three novel species of mycoplasma were identified from ostriches in South Africa. M. nasistruthionis sp. nov. and Mycoplasma sp. Ms02 are closely related to M. synoviae. Mycoplasmosis has a significant economic impact on the ostrich industry with losses resulting from upper respiratory (rhinotracheitis) and air sac infections, particularly in feedlot birds, and with exacerbation by extreme weather and possibly other stressors. Considerable research has been undertaken towards molecular characterization of these mycoplasmas and to develop an effective vaccine.Mycoplasma spp.bbb-eee   Ostrich, emu, common rhea (USA, Iran)Information on, and particularly pathogenicity of, other mycoplasmal infections in ratites is sporadic and frequently without detailed characterization of any organisms identified. Initial, non-molecular characterization of some isolates may not have been accurate. M. synoviae was identified by PCR from lung samples taken from slaughter ostriches in Iran. M. cloacale has been identified from tracheal or air sac swabs from ratites, a mycoplasma that reacted with M. synoviae antibody was present in the joint of an emu with polyarthritis, M. synoviae was isolated from tracheal samples from juvenile common rheas with upper respiratory infection and sinusitis, and colonization of the trachea can occur in young ostriches experimentally infected with M. gallisepticum. Disease as a result of the major poultry mycoplasmoses has not been diagnosed in ratites.a Ebedes, H., 1976. Anthrax epizootics in wildlife in the Etosha National Park.
