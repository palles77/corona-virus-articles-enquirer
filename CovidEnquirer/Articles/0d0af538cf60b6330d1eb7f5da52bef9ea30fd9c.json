However, he argues that the risk in his laboratory is considerably lower than the lower bound obtained from these reports of 0.2% per laboratory-year in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory. He states, \"These estimates, however, do not take into account specific pathogen types or research settings. This is crucial, because working practices in, e.g., virology and microbiology laboratories are different and because each biosafety laboratory is unique\" (1). He proposes an alternative calculation based on 0 viral laboratoryacquired infections (LAI) in BSL3 labs over 2,044 lab-years in BSL2, -3, and -4 labs with select agents (6) and suggests that the proper value is \u03fd1/2,044 lab-years, or \u03fd5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea4 /lab-year.",

While bacteriology and virology labs certainly perform some different activities, neither the references cited by Fouchier nor any other evidence of which we are aware justifies the relevant claim: that BSL3 bacteriology labs are more accident-prone than BSL3 virology labs over a given time span. Absent any such evidence, the proper comparison would be BSL3 LAI/BSL3 lab-years. Unfortunately, BSL3 lab-years are not publicly available. Therefore, in our original calculation, we used 2,044 lab-years in BSL2, -3, and -4 labs as a denominator to calculate a lower bound on the risk, with LAI in BSL3 as the numerator. Fouchier's suggestion to use the same (too-large) denominator to form an upper bound is inappropriate and is made more so by excluding bacterial LAI from the numerator but keeping bacterial lab-years in the denominator.",

Finally, underreporting of LAI is internationally the rule rather than the exception, in part because serosurveillance is not routinely performed in many highcontainment labs, and in part because reporting systems, if they exist, are inadequate. The Netherlands has been singled out as notable for inadequate surveillance and reporting of LAI (9) . Also, as a general principle, it is self-evident that the number of potentially serious laboratory exposures is greater than the number of actual confirmed laboratory infections. For example, the CDC has reported a number of potentially serious laboratory exposures this year, but none of them would have been factored into LAI calculations. At the time of this writing, it is unclear whether the exposure of a CDC technician to Ebola virus due to an error of switching live and inactivated samples has resulted in infection; whatever the outcome, this incident reinforces the idea that accidental exposures are possible in the best virologic laboratories.",

From these data he calculates a rather low risk of \u03fd1 per 70,000 worker-years, using the Henkel et al. (6) denominator, including all agents at all biosafety levels, and the numerator of known viral infections. This suffers from the same conceptual and statistical problems noted above and from the additional problem that the individuals \"approved\" to have access to a select agent facility will be highly heterogeneous in the amount of time they actually spend there. A more relevant metric, we suggest, is that estimated for the intramural labs in NIAID, which experienced 3 known LAIs in 634,500 person-hours of actually work in a BSL3 lab, or about a 1% risk for every 2,000 h of work in a BSL3 lab (8) .",

Research suggests that even the most experienced and knowledgeable workers sometimes cut corners and that everyone is susceptible to distraction, fatigue and faulty reasoning\" (10) . In this regard, it is notable that all three recently publicized CDC laboratory incidents (11, 12) involved removal of infectious material from the BSL3 containment facilities in which they were handled, in the false belief that the material was not infectious (the anthrax agent and Ebola virus) or in the false belief that the material did not contain a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) contaminant (influenza virus).

Moreover, the effectiveness of vaccines and antivirals against laboratory-engineered strains in these experiments is uncertain, even when they are effective against the starting strain; this is why the initial report of ferret-transmissible strains described assays of vaccine neutralization (experiment 7) and antiviral susceptibility (experiment 6) (17) . After performing the experiment, one can retrospectively infer that these protections would have been effective, but at the time of proposing an experiment, neither is certain.

He suggests that prophylaxis and vaccination should not only reduce the probability of infection (discussed above) but also reduce the probability of onward transmission by a factor of 100. The effect of prophylaxis and vaccination should be accounted for, as we noted in our article (5), but again only if the infection occurs in the source laboratory where workers are prepared; moreover, the factor of 100 reduction is much too optimistic, for the following reasons. (i) It assumes the infection is detected, which may or may not occur before spread. (ii) It assumes that vaccines and antivirals are given and effective against the labengineered virus, which is not guaranteed or in some cases even likely for the reasons noted above. (iii) If infection is detected before spread, and if vaccines and antivirals are given to the exposed person rapidly, and if the strain is susceptible to the antiviral, the reduction in infectiousness of a vaccinated, antiviraltreated case is probably closer to a factor of 5 to 8 than a factor of 100. This estimate is based on an assumption of multiplicative effects of antivirals and vaccination, using clinical data to estimate that oseltamivir reduces infectiousness approximately 5\u03eb (by 80%) (21) and a meta-analysis of published studies showing no reduction in infectiousness (22) yet suggesting a \"best guess\" of a 1.7-fold (40%) reduction in infectiousness from a well-matched inactivated vaccine (22) . If infection is not detected before spread, or if vaccines and antivirals are not given to the infected person(s) rapidly enough to prevent spread, or if the strain is not susceptible to the antiviral or vaccine, then there is no reduction in risk.",

Once again, this assumes that any exposure or infection is detected before transmission, something that has not occurred in a number of past LAIs. It also assumes that the exposures occur inside his laboratory, which is not guaranteed due to the possibility of erroneous or malicious removal of the strain from the lab. Notably, the one published study designed to estimate risk of uncontrolled spread given an LAI incorporated the assumption that detected LAIs would be subjected to nonpharmaceutical interventions, which would be somewhat effective against the first few cases of a flu-like agent. The risk of uncontrolled spread in that study came from scenarios in which such measures were not taken, for example, because the infection was not detected (23) (around a 5 to 15% chance depending on parameters), as well as from scenarios in which it was detected but not successfully con-Author Reply trolled, particularly for viruses with basic reproductive numbers exceeding 1.5. Of course, no effects of quarantine should be included in scenarios involving accidents outside the source lab.",

That rationale was to predict pandemic potential of natural isolates, which Fouchier earlier argued was associated with \"airborne transmission\" best studied in mammalian nonhuman hosts (24) . Likewise, Yoshihiro Kawaoka described the purpose of his ferret gain-of-transmission studies as \"[t]o determine whether H5N1 viruses could be transmitted between humans\" (25) , and the original reports of ferret transmission experiments say that pandemic potential is associated with the changes observed. For example: \"Whether this virus may acquire the ability to be transmitted via aerosols or respiratory droplets among mammals, including humans, to trigger a future pandemic is a key question for pandemic preparedness . . . Identification of the minimal requirements for virus transmission between mammals may have prognostic and diagnostic value for improving pandemic preparedness\" (17) . Similarly, in another ferret transmission study on synthetic 1918-like viruses from the Kawaoka lab, mutations conferring ferret transmissibility are specifically called \"human-adaptive mutations\" (26) . The CDC considers ferret transmissibility and human alpha-2,6 receptor binding to be 2 of the top 3 predictors of the threat of emergence of influenza viruses (27) . A recent publication by CDC influenza virologists suggests that they interpret specific mutations found in the ferret gain-of-transmission studies as signaling human adaptation, not specifically ferret adaptation (28) .",

Current denials that this is possible seem to be designed to reduce perceived risk from the experiments rather than to describe new scientific data or understanding. Paul Keim, the Chair of the National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity who reviewed the original submission of the H5N1 paper, stated, \"I can't think of another pathogenic organism that is as scary as this one\" (29) . The reaction of another member of the NSABB, Michael Imperiale, was as follows: \"[Imperiale] also says it was news to him that the mutated virus did not spread between ferrets via the aerosol route as readily as seasonal strains, as Fouchier showed at the ASM meeting. 'That really didn't come across to me in the paper,' he says. 'I didn't see that kind of comparison.'\" (30) . Without understanding why this change in interpretation has occurred, it is difficult to incorporate into a risk analysis a speculation that ferret adaptation reduces human adaptation, as Fouchier argues in his paper. Moreover, whether or not this occurred in the particular experiment involving H5N1 in the Fouchier lab, it cannot be assumed to be a reliable outcome of future studies.",

In this case, it would be appropriate to multiply our pandemic risk calculations by about 25%, because 3 out of 4 ferret passage experiments would produce strains not very harmful to humans. Twenty-five percent of the risk we estimated (5) is still exceptionally high. Yet now consider the use of this information by public health authorities. At best, three out of every four times they identified a veterinary or zoonotic isolate as high risk, they would actually be targeting a strain with features that make it attenuated in humans. They would be deploying resources to contain a strain that is, unbeknownst to them, human attenuated. One in four times, they might identify a strain with somewhat increased risk for humans, albeit not necessarily the strain most deserving of attention. In fact, because the prediction of mutational effects becomes more uncertain with changes in the genetic background, the predictive power of such targeting activities is even lower. In summary, while the possibility that ferret gain-of-transmission strains are attenuated in humans modestly reduces the risk estimate associated with producing and using them, it may nullify and even reverse the utility of such studies for public health.",

Indeed, Fouchier's lab was the first to demonstrate that in that genetic background, there was no detectable effect of the mutation (40) .

            "text": "Fouchier repeatedly describes his adjustments to the probability estimates we proposed as \"conservative,\" implying that the actual risk is even less than his figures show. His analysis is not conservative. His estimate of one LAI per~700,000 worker-years is dramatically lower than that currently estimated for any category of laboratory, and current estimates themselves are too low due to underreporting (9) . Moreover, describing the estimates as conservative is at odds with the use of large factors to stand for unknown effects of safety enhancements, inconsistent use of numerators and denominators to favor lower probabilities, and the assumption that safety enhancements used in the Erasmus MC laboratory will be effective in the face of evidence that many laboratory infections have no traceable cause and that many mishaps involving infectious exposures may occur outside the \"home laboratory.\" The assumptions of antiviral and vaccine effectiveness and reduced human transmissibility and virulence of selected strains range from uncertain (in the case of much of the published work) to unknowable (in the case of experiments not yet done) and false (in the case of reduced virulence and vaccine availability in examples such as H7N1) (15) . Such assumptions are \"anticonservative,\" giving too-optimistic predictions. Further problems include unsupported claims that the implementation of the select agent program necessarily strengthens biosafety. For example, in the CDC report on the lab accident involving H5N1, the description of the event indicates that scientists were making their decisions in reference to the select agent rule, as opposed to whether there was a biosafety breach (41) . The quality of \"targeted risk assessments\" undertaken before each study is performed is unclear; such assessments have not been quantitative to date (42, 43) .",

It would be extremely helpful for CDC to tabulate incidents with select agents, including LAIs, by the biosafety level of the laboratory involved, so that proper denominators can be used for calculations rather than having to rely on bounding arguments (6) . Critical evaluation of claims about the safety of particular laboratories-not only the Erasmus MC laboratory discussed by Fouchier but others where potential pandemic pathogen experiments are proposed or conducted-is impossible without transparent reporting of potential loss, release, and theft events at these particular facilities and in laboratories more generally (9) . If the CDC incidents of 2014 have any lesson, it is that state-of-the-art biosafety and biosecurity in highly respected facilities are no guarantee against human error, so there Author Reply is a limit to the reassurance one should take from lists of preventive measures in place at any particular facility.",

Ord et al. have noted that when one performs a risk analysis and estimates an exceptionally low probability (P) of a catastrophic outcome, it is crucial to consider the probability q (which may exceed P) that the model used to derive that probability is itself wrong, in a way that understates the true probability of the outcome (44) . In such a circumstance a correction is needed, adjusting the estimate upward to account for this uncertainty. The combination of an implausibly low estimate of LAI risk with assumptions that are difficult to defend, in a field where underreporting of accidents is thought to be routine (9) , would seem to make the assessment suggested by Fouchier's letter (1) a prime candidate for such adjustment.",
