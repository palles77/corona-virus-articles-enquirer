In the current study, 18 water-soluble b-cyclodextrin (CD)-GA conjugates, in which GA was covalently coupled to the primary face of b-CD using 1,2,3-triazole moiety along with varying lengths of linker, were synthesized via copper-catalyzed azide-alkyl cycloaddition reaction. Benefited from the attached b-CD moiety, all these conjugates showed lower hydrophobicity (AlogP) compared with their parent compound GA. With the exception of per-O-methylated b-CD-GA conjugate (35), all other conjugates showed no significant cytotoxicity to MDCK cells, and these conjugates were then screened against A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus using the cytopathic effect assay. The preliminary results indicated that six conjugates showed promising antiviral activity, and the C-3 and C-30 of GA could tolerate some modifications. Our findings suggested that GA could be used as a lead compound for the development of potential anti-influenza virus agents.",

Glycyrrhizic acid (1), composed of one molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA, 2) and two molecules of glucuronic acid (Fig. 1 ), can be hydrolyzed by b-glucuronidases in the intestinal bacteria [3] . The amount of 2 in licorice root is reported to be within the range of 0.1e1.6%, depending on species and growing region [4] . Compounds 1 and 2 have attracted considerable attention from chemists and pharmacologists because of their pharmacological and biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antiviral and other activities [1, 5] .",

It has shown that the administration of SNMC to patients with hepatitis C virus infection lowers the serum transaminase activity, even in the patients resistant to the interferon therapy [6] . Pompei et al. have reported that compound 1 can inhibit many DNA and RNA viruses, including HBV, HIV and EBV in vitro [7] . The antiviral activities of compound 1 against SARS-associated corona virus and influenza virus have also been demonstrated [8, 9] . Recently, it has been noted that the application of compound 1 as a potential antiviral agent can be further improved by using certain drug delivery systems, e.g., mucoadhesive nanoparticles based on poly (methyl vinyl ether-comaleic anhydride) (PVM/MA) [10] .",

Lin et al. have claimed that compound 2 is 7.5-fold more active against EBV (EC 50 \u00bc 4 mM) than its parent compound 1 (EC 50 \u00bc 30 mM) [11] . Compound 2 shows significant antiviral activity against rotavirus replication at a step or steps subsequent to virus entry [12] . The semi-synthetic derivatives of 2, such as 4-iodobenzyl ester (3), 4-nitrobenzyl ester (4) and 4-(trifluoromethyl) benzyl ester (5) , show potent inhibitory effects on HBV DNA replication activity with IC 50 s at the micromolar level [13] . A recent study has indicated that GA derivative (6) , with a 2-hydroxypropyl group at C-30 and an acetyl group at C-3, show remarkable antiviral activity against TK \u00fe and TK \u00c0 strains of HSV-1 with EC 50 of 4.95 mM [14] . Despite the recognized pharmacological roles as antiviral agents, the main disadvantage of compound 2 and its derivative for application in the food or pharmaceutical industry is their low aqueous solubility due to its non-polar structure (logP: 6.75 [15] ). It has reported that the solubility of compound 2 in water is only 10.6 mg/mL (37 C) , and the water/n-BuOH partition coefficient is 1.02 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 (37 C) [16] . This combination of strong lipophilicity, low solubility and partition coefficient indicates its low bioavailability.",

Cyclodextrins (CDs) are a class of highly water-soluble and biocompatible cyclic oligosaccharides, which can reversely form host-guest inclusion complexes with a variety of guest molecules (drugs), thus improving certain properties of drugs, such as solubility, stability and bioavailability [17, 18] . The CD-triterpene inclusion complexes have been also synthesized to increase the aqueous solubility of certain pentacyclic triterpenes [19e21] . Ishida et al. have reported that the complex of compound 2 and HP-g-CD can improve the oral bioavailability and reduce mRNA expressions of TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6 [22] . However, such a noncovalent complex is disadvantageous when drug targeting is to be attempted because the complex dissociates before it reaches the organs or tissues to which it is to be delivered [23] . Therefore, direct covalent linkage with b-CD has been suggested, which has been widely used in other water insoluble bioactive molecules, such as fullerene (C 60 ), 5-FU, folic acid and artesunate [24e27]. In our recent studies, a series of water-soluble triazole-bridged b-CD-pentacyclic triterpene conjugates have been synthesized via click chemistry [28, 29] .",

The results showed that most conjugates had no cytotoxicity against uninfected Madin-Daby canine kidney (MDCK) cells at a concentration of 50 mM, except for compound 35 possessing cytotoxicity at the same concentration (Fig. 2 ). This finding, together with our previous observation that per-O-methylated-b-CD derivatives of other pentacyclic triterpenes show different cytotoxicity at a concentration of 5e50 mM [28] , indicated that per-O-methylated-b-CD might impart certain degree of cytotoxicity in vitro. The five conjugates (23e27) with the GA and b-CD groups held constant, but with varying of the oligoethylene glycol linker revealed that compound 25 had the highest antiviral activity to A/ WSN/33 (H1N1) virus, indicating 1,2,3-triazole moiety along with diethylene glycol linker could allow a better fit between GA and the proper target. Elongation or shortening of the diethylene glycol chain leads to some decrease of the antiviral activity. Similar results were also observed for conjugates 18e22, in which the b-CD was acetylated, and compound 20 showed the greatest antiviral activity. The diethylene glycol linker of compounds 20 and 25 was further modified by replacing one ethylene glycol moiety with piperazine ring to increase the rigidness of the linker, leading to greatly reduced activity (20 vs. 30, 25 vs. 31). However, the introduction of an aromatic linker (1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)phenyl between b-CD and GA still retained reasonable antiviral activity (23 vs. 34). To our surprise, the introduction of aromatic amino acids methyl esters at C-30 of glycyrrhizin also showed more potent anti-influenza activity and 38e40 against MDCK cells using CellTiter-Glo \u00ae Assay. than their parent compound [9] , indicating an aromatic group at C-30 might be helpful for the binding of GA with its receptor.

Benefited from the per-Oalkyl b-CD moiety, the AlogP value was decreased about~2 units compared with GA (2). b-CD-GA conjugates showed the lowest ALogP values within the range of 0.09e0.77, indicating that their solubility in water was about 47,000-fold higher than their parent compound GA (2). As a matter of fact, during the biological assays of the prepared b-CD-GA conjugates, the parent compound GA (2) dissolved in water formed turbid solutions at a concentration of 50 mM and suspensions accompanied by a precipitate even when 5% DMSO (v/v) solutions were used.
