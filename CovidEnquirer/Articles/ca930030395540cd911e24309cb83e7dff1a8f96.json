TRIM13, a member of the TRIM family, is a RING domaincontaining E3 ubiquitin ligase which plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes including cell death, cancer and antiviral immunity. In this study, a TRIM13 homolog from orange spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (EcTRIM13) was cloned and characterized. The full-length of EcTRIM13 cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 399 amino acids which shared 81% identity with TRIM13 homolog from large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). Amino acid alignment analysis showed that EcTRIM13 contained conserved RING finger and B-box domain. Expression patterns analysis indicated that EcTRIM13 was abundant in liver, spleen, kidney, intestine and gill. Moreover, the transcript of EcTRIM13 in grouper spleen was differently regulated after injection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or polyinosinpolycytidylic acid (poly I:C). Under fluorescence microscopy, we observed the tubular structure in wild type EcTRIM13 transfected cells, but the RING domain mutant resulted in the fluorescence distribution was changed and the bright punctate fluorescence was evenly situated throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting that the RING domain was essential for its accurate localization. Overexpression of EcTRIM13 in vitro obviously increased the replication of red spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and the enhancing effect of EcTRIM13 on virus replication was affected by the RING domain. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM13 not only negatively regulated the interferon promoter activity induced by interferon regulator factor (IRF) 3, IRF7, and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), but also decreased the expression of several interferon related factors. In addition, the overexpression of EcTRIM13 also differently regulated the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors. Together, our results firstly demonstrated that fish TRIM13 exerted negative regulation of antiviral response against nodavirus infection.",

Knockdown of TRIM15 decreased retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) induced interferon production and enhanced vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replication [5] . Overexpression of TRIM4 potentiated virus-triggered activation of interferon regulator factor (IRF) 3 and IFN-b induction, and finally mildly inhibited VSV replication [6] . Moreover, several TRIM proteins were proposed to restrict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or murine leukemia viruses (MLV) replication upon overexpression in vitro [3, 5, 7] . In addition to the antiviral activity to RNA virus, TRIM21 and TRIM5a were also found to exert their antiviral roles against DNA viruses [8] .",

Further studies showed that TRIM13 regulated the translocation of caspase-8 to autophagosome and its fusion with lysosome during ER stress [10] . Furthermore, TRIM13 was able to interact with NF-kappa-B essential modulator (NEMO) and modulate its ubiquitination which may regulate IKK complex activity [11] . In addition, TRIM13 not only interacted with both melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and RIG-I in vitro, but also functioned as a negative regulator of MDA5mediated type I IFN production and abolished the resistance against a lethal challenge with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) [12] . Although great progresses have been made in the function of mammalian TRIM13s, no information about fish TRIM13 was available.",

In our study, EcTRIM13 contained both RING and B-box domain. Sequence analysis indicated that EcTRIM13 shared 81% identity with that from large yellow croaker. Expression patterns analysis indicated that the transcript of EcTRIM13 in grouper spleen was differently regulated after injection with SGIV or poly I:C, suggested that EcTRIM13 might be involved in innate immune response against fish virus infection, like other fish TRIMs [18] . In addition, subcellular localization analysis indicated that EcTRIM13 localized in the cytoplasm of grouper cells and displayed tubular structure. Like EcTRIM39, the deletion of RING significantly affected the accurate intracellular localization of EcTRIM13.",

            "text": "Research efforts so far demonstrated that a substantial number of the TRIM family members have emerged as viral restriction factors or as regulators of pathways in response to virus infection [1, 4] . The ectopic expression of TRIM proteins, including TRIM11, TRIM5, TRIM56, TRIM22, TRIM38 and TRIM68 were able to negatively or positively regulate virus replication in vitro [5,7,23e29] . TRIM56 was found to function as an antiviral host factor that confers resistance to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and human coronavirus virus (HCoV) OC43 through overlapping and distinct molecular determinants. Moreover, the N-terminal RING domain were always required for the antiviral activity of EcTRIM56 [26, 27] . In contrast, overexpression of TRIM38 or TRIM11 in vitro resulted in enhanced replication of VSV [28, 29] . In our study, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM13 significantly enhanced RGNNV replication, evidenced by the increase of CPE progression and viral gene transcription. Moreover, the deletion of RING domain significantly weakened the enhancing effect of EcTRIM13 on virus replication. The negative regulation of antiviral function was also explored in human TRIM13 after challenge with EMCV [12] . Thus, we speculated that TRIM13 exerted conserved functions in response to RNA virus during the evolution from fish to mammals.",

            "text": "Based on the regulatory effects of TRIM proteins on virus replication, further studies explored the multiple molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between TRIM proteins and other signaling molecules or their downstream events [6, 27, 29, 30] . Ectopic expression of TRIM11 decreased IFNb promoter activity induced by the overexpression of RIG-I, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), or TANK-binding kinase-1 (TBK1). Moreover, TRIM11 overexpression inhibited the phosphorylation of IRF3 and mRNA expression of IFNb [29] . In addition, TRIM13 was found to interact with both MDA5 and RIG-I in vitro, and negatively regulate MDA5-mediated type I IFN production [12] . In this study, our results indicated that overexpression of EcTRIM13 not only negatively regulated the interferon promoter activity induced by IRF3, IRF7 and MDA5, but also decreased the expression of interferon related genes, including IRF3, IRF7, LGP2, MXI, MDA5, and ISG15. In addition, the ectopic expression of EcTRIM13 differently regulated the expression of IL-6, IL-1b and TNFa. Thus, we proposed that EcTRIM13 not only functioned as a negative regulator of IFN response in the innate antiviral immunity, but also regulated the inflammation response against virus infection. Combined with our previous studies identifying IRF3, MDA5, and ISG15 as antiviral factors against RGNNV infection [20, 31, 32] , we speculated that the negative regulation of interferon immune response by EcTRIM13 might contribute directly to the enhancing effect on RGNNV replication.",
