Vestibular signs including head tilt, circling, ataxia, strabismus and nystagmus were observed between birth and 2 months of age. These clinical signs persisted for a median of 237 days and had resolved by 2 years of age in all cases. Pedigree analysis revealed that all affected tigers were closely related and shared a single common ancestor in the last four generations. A genetic cause for the disease is suspected and, based on pedigree and segregation analysis, an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is likely. Further investigations to determine the world-wide prevalence and underlying pathology of this disorder are warranted.",

The current study was designed to investigate the prevalence, phenotype and potential cause(s) of CVD in Sumatran tiger cubs, within the Australasian region. The aims of the study were to define the phenotype of CVD in captive Sumatran tigers, and to determine the heritability of this disorder and its potential mode of inheritance (MOI).",

In addition, seven affected cubs abducted their limbs and ventrally flexed their necks when raised from the ground with their pelvises at the highest point, accompanied by exaggeration of the head tilt. The duration and severity of clinical signs varied between cases. Five of the affected cubs had intermittent episodes of clinical signs, whereas clinical signs were persistent in all other cases.

            "text": "In affected Sumatran tiger cubs, there was variability in the clinical presentation, age of onset and duration of clinical signs. Some cubs showed intermittent episodes of vestibular dysfunction that resolved spontaneously. This might reflect exacerbation of well compensated deficits following stress, or alternatively could represent an intermittent disorder. A syndrome in humans, benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (BPVC), has similar features with CVD in Sumatran tigers. Brief but intense periods of ataxia and nystagmus are the hallmark signs of BPVC and symptoms often resolve before sexual maturity (Balatsouras et al., 2007) . Neurological examination and vestibular function are normal between episodes in these patients (Ralli et al., 2009 ). The pathogenesis of BPVC is poorly understood but one proposed mechanism is impaired vascular perfusion to the vestibular nuclei and associated neurological pathways (Ralli et al., 2009 ). Due to the episodic nature of CVD in some affected tigers, it was difficult to assign a definitive phenotype to some individuals. Continual, close monitoring of tiger cubs from an early age can be challenging, and lack of observational evidence was one of the limitations of this retrospective study. It is standard zoo husbandry practice to have minimal interaction with female tigers and their cubs, to mitigate the potential for mis-mothering and ensure staff safety (Von Schmalz-Peixoto, 2003) . The assignment of the 'affected' phenotype was therefore more likely to be more accurate than the assignment of the 'unaffected' phenotype. This means that modelling may have been subject to some degree of bias. For establishment of accurate phenotypes in the future, close monitoring of Sumatran tiger cubs could readily be achieved using video surveillance.",

The lack of a menace response, in the face of normal vision, can sometimes be seen in young animals and mentation can be difficult to assess in young cubs.

However, in these reports, sample sizes were small, and reference ranges for juvenile non-domesticated felids have not been established. Florida panther nursing cubs have been shown to have lower serum retinol concentrations than adults (Dunbar et al., 1999) . Vitamin A deficiency in captive lions has been associated with calvarial hyperostosis and cerebellar herniation (Chandra et al., 1999; Hartley et al., 2005) . However, the calvaria of affected tiger cubs in the present study were considered to be normal on radiography. This, and the observation that no dietary deficiencies were apparent, suggests that vitamin A deficiency is unlikely to be a causative factor in the pathogenesis of CVD in Sumatran tiger cubs. Since 90% of total body vitamin A is stored in the liver, hepatic levels are the most reliable indicator of vitamin A status (Schweigert et al., 1990) . Future investigations should include determination of hepatic vitamin A levels by fineneedle aspiration biopsy and high-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet retinoid analysis, as has been described in lions (Shamir et al., 2012) .",

No microbial agents were visualised on examination of the CSF and the lack of eosinophils in the CSF suggests that parasitic or protozoan infections are unlikely. Otoscopic, radiographic and MRI examinations of the external and middle ear did not support otitis media and interna as a contributing factor to this disease. Although no tigers were specifically tested for canine distemper virus (CDV), the lack of disease progression suggests that this is an unlikely cause and there was no evidence of suggestive lesions at necropsy.

Furthermore, segregation analysis suggested an autosomal dominant MOI, supported by the high frequency of the disorder within the pedigree, in combination with the predicted allele sequences based on that MOI and a Hardy-Weinberg segregation, as well as the presence of the syndrome in a hybrid tiger. Segregation analysis suggested that the trait has complete penetrance, although the disorder was not observed for two generations and then manifested in a subsequent generation, which is inconsistent with a fully penetrant dominant trait. Despite the segregation analysis indicating complete penetrance, there may have been too few animals included for a robust analysis. The research findings reported here reflect a common difficulty with segregation analysis, in that the data provided by the analysis may not be in agreement with the observations made or not compatible with any one type of inheritance. Errors in phenotype determination, genetic anticipation, phenocopy or the occurrence of new mutations could explain these discrepancies. If this genetic disorder is multi-factorial, there may also be little consistency between observations and segregation analysis results (Nicholas, 2010) .",

Interactions between genetic and environmental effects can be complex and may cause alterations in penetrance and the variation in expression of the phenotype seen in the tiger cubs. Modifier genes can also cause variation in phenotype and penetrance, with some genes having downstream effects, promoting the occurrence of the disease phenotype (Raj et al., 2010) . Identification of the causative mutation could provide further clues to other genes that might modify expression of the mutated gene or could possibly identify allele variants of the mutation. The genes associated with CVD in other species might also be involved in CVD in tiger cubs, or there may be an as yet undefined gene or combination of genes responsible. Genetic mutations have been associated with malformation or malfunction of both peripheral and central vestibular components (Steel, 1995; Reardon et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2008; Vernau et al., 2013) .",

The segregation analysis has identified potential carriers of the disorder. Nonaffected siblings are not likely to be carrying the mutation, although interference from reduced penetrance or variable expression might mean that this is not necessarily the case. CVD is assumed to disadvantage affected cubs in the wild, although there appears to be limited impact in captivity, with all cubs surviving to adulthood, when there was resolution of the clinical signs. Loss of genetic diversity is a significant threat to the Sumatran tiger population and removal of individuals from the breeding program would put further strain on the gene pool and its genetic fitness. However, valid conclusions about future breeding cannot be made without understanding the global status of this genetic condition.",
