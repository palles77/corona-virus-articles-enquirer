Antimicrobial host defense peptides have been investigated for their potential as a new class of antimicrobial drugs. Recently their immunomodulatory activities have begun to be appreciated. Modulation of innate immunity by synthetic variants of host defense peptides, called innate defense regulators (IDRs), is protective without direct antimicrobial action. We discuss the potential and current limitations in exploiting the immunomodulatory activity of IDRs as a novel anti-infective pathway. IDRs show significant promise and current research is uncovering mechanistic information that will aid in the future development of IDRs for clinical use.",

A common application of small molecules is to target intracellular signal transduction pathways [12] . For example, organ transplant rejection can be limited by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with rapamycin or by inhibiting calcineurin with cyclosporine and FK506, thus reducing T-cell signal transduction. Many other small molecules that target components of pathways, such as those involving nuclear factor kB (NFkB), p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), and Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT), are also undergoing clinical trials [12] .

The use of immunosuppressive therapies is often associated with increased risk of infections and might also predispose individuals to cancer [15, 16] . Immunostimulatory treatments can result in inflammatory tissue damage, autoimmunity or potentially fatal cytokine storms [17, 18] . These risks limit the application of most immunotherapies to life-threatening conditions for which better-tolerated treatments are not available. It is increasingly recognized that most conditions will not be treatable through generic stimulation or suppression of the immune system, as demonstrated by the failures of immunosuppressive therapies for sepsis [19] . Hence, we need to develop tools that precisely control, modulate and/or polarize the immune response. To be commercially viable, ideal therapies also need to be broad-spectrum and target a class of related conditions or pathogens. These challenges highlight the importance of studying the immune system from a systems biology perspective to predict the outcome and efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies [20, 21] . This is discussed further in Box 1.",

This undoubtedly plays a key role in immune defenses within some locations, such as phagolysosomes of leukocytes and the crypts of the small intestine. However, the microbicidal activity of the peptides is highly sensitive to antagonism by divalent cations, serum and anionic macromolecules such as glycosaminoglycans [27] , and thus their immunomodulatory activity is probably more significant in many physiological environments. The immunomodulatory activities of HDPs include diverse effects on Box 1. Systems biology approaches to studying immunomodulatory activity Drug development and complex systems The innate immune system is a very complex, non-linear network for which there is great potential for subtle manipulations of signaling pathways and subsequent changes in cytokine production with farreaching downstream effects that might be beneficial but are not completely predictable, desirable or controllable [21] . As recently discussed by Schadt et al. [20] , progress in drug discovery and development requires an integrated approach that takes into account the non-linear causal relationships inherent in complex systems. This concept applies particularly to immunomodulation because of the significant cross-talk between pathways in the immune system. It is not possible to model the entire innate immune system either in vitro or computationally; however, systems biology approaches can aid in the understanding of complex interactions and signaling pathways. Attempts to understand the likely effects of immunmodulatory drugs require an appreciation of associated interactions within the immune system as a whole and their effects on other major systems, such as metabolism and hormonal and neuronal pathways.",

It has been proposed that its mechanism of action involves enhanced chemokine production accompanied by moderation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) and is mediated through modulation of specific intracellular signaling pathways. Such activities provide a powerful rationale for using HDPs to design synthetic peptides with optimized immunomodulatory activity.

            "text": "An important aspect for the design of immunomodulatory peptides is the development and validation of screening techniques. High-throughput in vitro screening of antibacterial activity has been used for validation and iterative optimization of rationally designed antimicrobial peptides [30, 31] . Through the use of large data sets, made possible by high-throughput screening of peptide libraries, it has been possible to identify particular physical characteristics that correlate well with direct antimicrobial activity. By contrast, owing to the complexity of the interactions between multiple cell types and effector molecules, it is not possible to screen for subtle immunomodulatory activities in vitro and surrogate markers of this activity must be used. Instead, it is necessary to use screens that correlate with enhanced protection. For example, IDR-1 was selected based on its in vitro immunomodulatory LL-37 has anti-endotoxic activity, induces chemokine production, promotes IL-1b secretion, but inhibits inflammatory responses to certain TLR ligands [32, 61, 62] Neutrophils LL-37 and defensins are produced by neutrophils, stored within neutrophil granules and play an important microbicidal role in phagolysosomes. When released extracellularly, LL-37 acts as a neutrophil chemoattractant, inhibits neutrophil apoptosis, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines and promotes both chemokine induction and the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils [63, 64] Mast cells Mast cells are important producers of LL-37 in the skin. LL-37 and b-defensins are mast cell chemoattractants and promote mast cell degranulation [65, 66] Conventional dendritic cells Defensins and cathelicidins are dendritic cell (DC) chemoattractants. LL-37 promotes differentiation of monocyte-derived DCs, but inhibits DC maturation and activation by TLR-ligands. b-Defensin 2 might promote DC activation as an endogenous TLR4 ligand. The adjuvant activities of defensins and cathelicidins in vivo might be mediated in part through their activity on DCs [67] [68] [69] Plasmacytoid dendritic cells LL-37 in complex with DNA oligonucleotides strongly induces IFNa production by plasmacytoid DCs. This activity might contribute to the pathology of psoriasis [70] Epithelial cells Keratinocytes LL-37 promotes keratinocyte migration and production of IL-8, inhibits keratinocyte apoptosis, modulates responses to TLR ligands, and might have wound healing activities in the skin. Altered proteolytic processing of hCAP18 and LL-37 has been implicated in the pathology of rosacea [54, 71, 72] Bronchial epithelium LL-37 acts on bronchial epithelial cells to stimulate cytokine and chemokine production and promote apoptosis [73, 74] Intestinal epithelium a-Defensins are produced by Paneth cells and their microbiocidal activity plays an important role in the immune defenses of the gut. Reduced a-defensin production might contribute to Crohn's disease. LL-37 promotes mucin production and survival of intestinal epithelial cells [75, 76] Other cells Vascular endothelium LL-37 induces activation and proliferation of vascular endothelium, promoting angiogenesis [77] Mesenchymal stromal cells LL-37 acts as a chemokine for mesenchymal stromal cells and promotes the production of various cytokines, as well as VEGF and MMP2; this can contribute to angiogenesis and tumor progression [57] Cancer cells LL-37 promotes migration and proliferation of lung, ovarian and breast cancer cells and LL-37 production by cancer cells in vivo promotes tumor growth. However, LL-37 also augments the anti-cancer therapeutic activity of CpG oligonucleotides [78, 79] Review Trends in Biotechnology Vol. 27 No.10 activities, namely enhanced release of chemokines from peptide-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [29] and its ability to protect mice against bacterial infections. Another possible screen would be ability to suppress TNF-a induction in response to treatment with TLR agonists [32] . Even with the use of such markers, candidate peptides must ultimately be tested in vivo because isolated cell systems cannot capture the complexity of the innate immune response. Thus, compared to testing of antimicrobial activity, for which there is often a strong correlation between in vitro and in vivo activity, it is much more labor-intensive and costly to generate the large data sets necessary for the application of computational methods to immunomodulatory peptide design. Despite this problem, we now have a few precedents. For example, synthetic endotoxin-binding peptides were optimized for protection in vivo [33] and a fragment of the human HDP LL-37 was optimized for anti-endotoxin activity through appropriate amino acid substitutions [34] . Gallo and colleagues [35] subsequently separated the weak antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of LL-37 in individual truncated peptides derived from LL-37. In certain studies the activities of smaller bactenecin-and indolicidin-like synthetic peptides were optimized as components of adjuvant formulations (because innate immunity instructs adaptive immunity) by screening for chemokine-inducing activity and then subjected to in vivo analysis [36] [37] [38] .",

Design strategies for IDRs. Design and testing of IDRs are iterative processes. Initial candidate peptides are based on naturally occurring HDPs, designed using computational tools or randomly generated. These candidate peptides are tested in vitro and in vivo and computational analysis is used to select characteristics associated with function. New candidate peptides can then be designed using this structure-function relationship information and further testing reveals further information. Data from in vitro and in vivo testing also inform studies of the mechanism of action of IDRs and this information can feed back in to the bioinformatic and computational design approach.

As these interactors are identified, peptides with the optimal shape, hydrophobicity and/or charge characteristics might be designed in docking studies, although the requirement for uptake might place certain restraints on peptide design.

However, the former was found to be safe when delivered topically, with efficacy in phase II clinical trials targeting both the inflammatory sequellae of severe acne and a non-infectious inflammatory skin disease, rosacea. Systemic safety was demonstrated for hLF1-11 in immunocompromised hematopoetic stem cell transplant recipients. Another interesting peptide, RDP58, which was derived from the heavy chain of HLA class I molecules, was also safe in clinical trials (although much of the information regarding this peptide is not publicly available) [42] . According to Genzyme Corporation (http://www.genzyme.com/corp/licensing/gen-z_p_rdp58_login.asp), RDP58 enhances heme oxygenase activity and inhibits inflammatory responses to stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phytohemagglutinin (PHA), double-stranded RNA and cytokines such as TNF-a and interleukin (IL)-1b. RDP58 reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, interferon (IFN)-g and IL-12, but did not affect the production of several other cytokines, including IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. The proposed mechanism of action involves interference with intracellular signaling pathways, although the specific details and interactors are currently unknown [42] .",

For example, RDP58 does not affect IL-6 or IL-10 production, whereas IDR-1 enhances their production. The distinct responses to these peptides indicate the value of different design strategies, because RDP58 was based on HLA class I molecules whereas IDR-1 design was based on a bovine cathelicidin. Importantly, this range of potential activities indicates that if we can understand the intricacies of immunomodulatory peptide interactions with host cell components and pathways, it might be possible to design peptides with customized immunomodulatory effects to target different diseases (Box 3).",

The inclusion of poly-L-lysine in a vaccine formulation with CpG-oligodinucleotide (ODN) moderated induction of the potentially dangerous pro-inflammatory cytokine response [58] . In addition, both IC31 [comprising a synthetic peptide (KLKL(5)KLK) attached to a synthetic ODN] and a formulation of indolicidin, CpG ODN and polyphosphazene induced antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses [37, 38, 59] . Garlapati et al. [36] recently demonstrated adjuvant activity for IDRs in neonatal pigs in combination with other molecules such as CpG ODNs and polyphosphazenes. The authors proposed that such formulations could be used as adjuvants that are effective in neonates, a population that is notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate and that is highly susceptible to many potentially fatal infectious diseases. It is also conceivable that peptides can be developed as adjuvants for mucosal vaccines because they could be optimized for enhanced induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-12, IL-15 and IL-18) and chemokines, such as MCP-1, which show adjuvant activity when administered with mucosal vaccinations [60] .",

Immune responses are often delicately balanced and upsetting this balance too greatly can render the system unable to return to homeostasis.

Two phase II trials of RDP58 in a combined cohort of 127 patients revealed that the drug was well tolerated (adverse effects equivalent to placebo) and efficacious in improving sigmoidoscopy scores in colitis patients receiving medium or high doses of the drug [42] .

The addition of glutoxim to standard tuberculosis therapy regimes reduced the time needed to clear the bacterium, increased the time to resolution of pulmonary infiltrate and increased the rate of post infection weight gain [46] . Adverse effects were limited to transient febrile events that resolved on discontinuation of the drug. Preclinical studies in human neutrophils and whole blood demonstrated an immunomodulatory mode of action [47] , suggesting that immunomodulatory peptide-based drugs can be safe and effective. Glutoxim is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials in the USA as a chemotherapy adjuvant (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/ show/NCT00347412) in non-small-cell lung cancer rather than as an anti-infective, possibly because of the relatively low incidence of tuberculosis in the USA and lesser potential for return on investment. Early results are promising and include reductions in chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and modulation of lymphocyte subsets (www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00347412), suggesting that glutoxim might also have an immunomodulatory role in the treatment of neoplastic disease.",

This raises the question of how a peptide that is presumably degraded rapidly can have long-lasting effects and whether enhancement of peptide stability is desirable in this context. One possibility is that the peptides prime immune cells; indeed, their ability to translocate into immune cells [40] might protect them from proteolytic degradation.
