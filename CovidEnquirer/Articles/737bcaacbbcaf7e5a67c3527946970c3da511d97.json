Among its main therapeutic indications, it is frequently used in the management of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus Lutz et al., 2009) . rFeIFN-x therapy induces clinical improvement of retroviral infected cats (de Mari et al., 2004; Domenech et al., 2011; Gil et al., 2013) , and increases their survival time (de Mari et al., 2004) . Slightly changes in some clinical parameters such as hypergammaglobulinemia, CD4/CD8 ratio, proviral load and viremia have been previously reported in retroviral infected cats during rFeIFN-x therapy (Domenech et al., 2011) . According to these authors, rFeIFN-x is thought to act on innate immunity (Domenech et al., 2011) . More recently, another study reported that the rFeIFN-x licensed protocol improves the clinical presentation and reduces concurrent viral excretion in naturally retroviral-infected cats living in catteries, suggesting its usefulness in multi-cat environments where viral-related disorders are often a clinical problem (Gil et al., 2013) . In that study, no significant abnormalities were observed in the hematology or biochemistry profiles during treatment (Gil et al., 2013) .",

Similarly to what is observed with Human Interferon-Alpha (HIFN-a) therapy, daily oral administration of rFeIFN-x may provide effective immune modulation in FIV cats. To the authors' knowledge, only one trial has been performed, which used experimentally infected and asymptomatic FIV cats (Caney et al., 2003) . It described the successful use of a daily oral rFeIFN-x dose (0.1 MU/cat) for 6 weeks, but was not intended to assess any clinical benefit. Although no significant changes were obtained in provirus loads or CD4:CD8 ratio, the animals increased their bodyweight and the oral protocol was well tolerated (Caney et al., 2003) . However, no further studies were performed in order to evaluate whether oral administration of rFeIFNx is efficient in cats with naturally occurring retroviral infections or its use over longer periods in symptomatic cats.",

Among them, Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPE) and Acute Phase Proteins (APP) are potential complementary exams to evaluate the immune system of treated cats. SPE is a laboratory test that allows the separation of serum proteins based on size and electrical charge. Serum proteins are therefore divided into different fractions (alpha, beta and gamma-globulins) whose increase or decrease can be interrelated (Taylor et al., 2010) . The gamma-globulin fraction has a special relevance in FIV cats. An increase in this fraction is associated with chronic antigenic stimulation and, according to previous studies, tends to occur in FIV positive cats (Gleich and Hartmann, 2009 ). This is mainly due to concurrent infections and a polyclonal B-cell activation which are a direct consequence of FIV infection and is seen even in apparently healthy FIV-positive cats (Ackley et al., 1990; Flynn et al., 1994; Gleich and Hartmann, 2009; Hartmann, 2011) . In human medicine, especially in low resource areas, SPE has been used to monitor the response of anti-retroviral therapy in HIV patients (Sarro et al., 2010) . Therefore, SPE could be a promising complementary exam in FIV infected cats.",

Hence, APP serum levels seem to be indirect indicators of innate immune system stimulation. A recent study described the use APP levels to monitor the effect of the licensed rFeIFN-x protocol on innate immunity in FIV-positive cats. All the treated cats increased Alpha-1-glycoprotein (AGP), Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) suggesting that these parameters may be reliable in the individual monitoring of rFeIFN-x immune-modulation therapy (Leal et al., 2012) .",

Animals and treatment protocols 11 FIV-positive cats were treated with oral rFeIFN-x (PO Group) and the results were compared with data previously obtained from 7 FIV-positive cats treated with the licensed protocol (SC Group). The inclusion criteria used were based on previous publications (de Mari et al., 2004; Gil et al., 2013) . No medications apart from rFeIFN-x were allowed during the period of the study. Retroviral status was confirmed in all the animals by ELISA kits using serum or plasma samples from D0 (Viracheck/FIV and Viracheck/FeLV, Synbiotics). The results of the SC Group were previously published as a single-arm trial which evaluated clinical improvement and concurrent viral excretion (Gil et al., 2013) . The data from this group were considered as a positive control for the current study. The PO Group consisted of 11 naturally FIV-infected cats referred to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which were treated, after obtaining the owner's consent, with 0.1 MU/cat rFeIFN-x orally, once a day for 90 consecutive days. 6/11 cats were single-housed or lived indoor with no more than one other cat while 5/11 cats were outdoor animals or came from a multi-cat environment. To obtain the correct dose, a vial containing the rFeIFN-x freeze-dried pellet (10 MU) was diluted in 25 ml of sterile physiological saline. Single-doses were prepared using 1 ml syringes containing 0.25 ml each by one of the members of the research group and given to owners who were instructed how to administer the therapy. The syringes were kept frozen (\u00c018 to \u00c020\u00b0C) after preparation and owners defrosted each single dose shortly before administration. All animals were submitted to full clinical evaluations on days 0 (before therapy), 10, 30 and 65. Animals in the PO Group had an additional evaluation on day 90 (end of therapy).",

            "text": "This study showed that, independently of the protocol applied, rFeIFN-x induces a significant clinical improvement of treated FIVinfected cats. Unexpectedly and although not statistically significant, the PO Group had slightly higher overall clinical scores than the SC Group. This can be due to the fact that the five outdoor cats revealed higher clinical scores than any cat from the SC Group, counter-balancing the almost asymptomatic indoor cats. In fact, no significant differences were observed on clinical improvement between groups suggesting that, in a clinical setting where cost might be a limiting factor and subcutaneous administration might be problematic, rFeIFN-x may be administered orally with success in FIV positive cats. However, despite the lack of statistical difference, the rFeIFN-x licensed protocol (subcutaneous injections) appeared to induce a marked clinical improvement in a larger proportion of the cats (Gil et al., 2013) . This suggests that the licensed protocol seems to be a better choice in more symptomatic cats when an effective and marked clinical improvement is desired. Being a feline recombinant product, it does not induce neutralizing antibodies meaning that the high-dose protocol may be used safely and efficiently even if repeat administration is required. This is an important factor to consider in a condition where management will be life-long. As expected, the concurrent viral excretion was minimal in the PO Group mainly due to the fact that these animals were not living in a shelter condition, where opportunistic infections are more difficult to control. Despite the apparent overall reduction in the viral loads of FHV-1, FCoV and FPV during oral treatment, these findings were considered to be without clinical significance taking into account the low initial viral loads in this group. Further studies are required to fully clarify the role of oral rFeIFN-x in the reduction of concurrent viral excretion, particularly in shelter medicine. Regarding the calicivirus status, no changes were observed in positive animals during oral treatment, and one of the negative cats became positive during therapy. This had no relationship with the clinical presentation, as oral rFeIFN-x induced a useful clinical improvement in the animals in spite of the fact that they remained FCV positive, and agrees with previous studies which describe the long-term carrier state of many cats (Coyne et al., 2007) . According to these authors, truly persistent infection is relatively rare and most of the FCV-positive cats undergo cyclical reinfections. These results in the oral group are also somewhat in contrast to the group receiving higher doses by subcutaneous injection, where reduction of viral excretion was more marked. Nevertheless, this study reveals that beneficial immune-modulation can be obtained even with low oral doses of rFeIFN-x. In a similar fashion to HIFNa (Tompkins, 1999) , it may induce a local stimulation of lymphoid tissues which results in a systemic modulation of the immune response. Studies regarding rFeIFN-x pharmacokinetics are scarce (Ueda et al., 1993) . In contrast to HIFN-a, some authors report that rFeIFN-x is acid resistant, which means that it may have a greater relative oral absorption or have activity on the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, thus better potentiating the overall immune system (Addie, 2012; Ueda et al., 1993) . In contrast to the licensed protocol (Gil et al., 2013) , when the PO protocol was used the improvement of oral lesions (ulcers and caudal stomatitis) was milder. This is in contrast to the effects seen in a previous study where the same oral administration protocol induced significant improvements in cats with refractory caudal stomatitis (Hennet et al., 2011) . One major difference is that in that study all cats were retrovirus negative. This suggests that when treating retrovirus positive cats for caudal stomatitis, better results may be obtained with a protocol which, at least initially, uses higher injectable doses. Despite the more limited impact on caudal stomatitis and viral excretion, the oral protocol resulted in a significant improvement in other parameters such as body condition and coat appearance. Coat appearance is a non specific sign in cats but it is the authors' opinion that a good esthetical improvement in the animals might be a favorable point for improving the owners' compliance. Regarding the body condition, it was previously reported that rFeIFN-x may be helpful in the initial resolution of anorexia in hyperthermic cats (Lutz et al., 2011) . Although there was no anorexia reported in this study, animals increased their weight which is in agreement with the previously cited trial using oral rFeIFN-x in FIV-positive asymptomatic cats (Caney et al., 2003) . This is particularly important in thin and debilitated animals. As also described by some authors (Hennet et al., 2011) , the clinical improvement observed may be related to the relief of oral lesions, even if only mild, which helps improve mastication and increase appetite. Animals with ocular discharge also showed a good improvement which is probably related to the control of opportunistic infections subsequent to immune modulation rather than a direct local antiviral effect.",

SAA lg/ml AGP lg/ml CRP lg/ml and normochromic anemia on D90 was submitted to a clinical workup. The anemia was considered to be resulted of chronic inflammation and concurrent respiratory tract disease. After the end of the study, this animal was treated with antibiotics (Cefovecine) which improved the respective blood results. Considering the two outdoor cats in the PO Group that revealed transitory elevations of ALT and AST serum levels, a possible hepatic lipidosis secondary to an inappropriate food intake or a subclinical pancreatitis was considered. However, recognizing that both animals did not show any other clinical abnormalities, and that this increase was only analytical and values normalized within the period of study, the owners refused to perform the respective complementary exams suggested. Similarly to the licensed protocol, and as expected, oral rFeIFN-x does not induce significant hematological or biochemical changes. The SPE results showed that all the animals of both groups presented an hypergammaglobulinemia and a concurrent hyperproteinemia at the beginning of the study. These findings corroborate the results of previous studies that describe an hypergammaglobulinemia in FIV positive cats, due to a concurrent opportunistic infections and polyclonal B-cell activation (Gleich and Hartmann, 2009; Hartmann, 2011) . Considering that no significant changes were observed in either group, rFeIFN-x does not seem to interfere with SPE, independently of the protocol administered. However, despite the lack of statistical significance, there appeared to be a tendency for the hypergammaglobulinemia to increase in the SC Group, while concurrent viral excretion reduced (Gil et al., 2013) , suggesting that it could be related to a subtle but detectable immune stimulation increasing the activity of Bcells. In contrast, this was not observed in the PO Group where the hypergammaglobulinemia and total proteins remained stable during therapy. As expected, outdoor cats showed a more evident hypergammaglobulinemia and raised total protein levels than indoor ones, which could simply be related to a higher level of antigen-exposure in different environments. Considering APP profile, on D0 the PO Group revealed higher AGP SAA and CRP serum levels when compared to the SC one. Previous results described an increase of APP levels in FIV-positive cats treated with the SC protocol (Leal et al., 2012) . In contrast, administration of oral rFeIFN-x did not induce significant changes in CRP, SAA and AGP serum levels. This is in agreement with a previous study performed in dogs where APPs were higher in dogs from private householders in comparison with cleaned kennels (Yamamoto et al., 1994) . Thus, one possible explanation relies on a wide exposure to different environmental factors. Although they were living in a shelter, cats from the SC Group remained restricted to a particular area whilst cats from the PO Group, even indoor ones, were probably in contact with a larger variety of different daily stimuli. However, there are some arguments which do not support this theory. In fact, cats from the animal shelter were positive to other concurrent viruses on D0 (Gil et al., 2013) , suggesting that environmental factors were less controlled in this group. Subsequently, as these cats improved their clinical conditions during rFeIFN-x therapy, their APP levels increased and concurrent viral excretion decreased. Therefore, more than simply the environmental exposure to pathogens, these data support the hypothesis that the shelter cats had a more evident immune-suppressed basal health status. This can explain a poor innate response and subsequent lower levels of APP despite the clear evidence of opportunistic infections. Consequently, the shelter-housed SC Group showed lower initial levels of APP, which increased with therapy suggesting a restoration of the immune competency. Oral rFeIFNx did not significantly change the APP profile meaning that, despite the chronic oral therapy, the observed clinical benefits do not seem to be related with an increase on APP profile in these animals. A suggested explanation for this relies on the fact that, a chronic oral therapy may induce an overall clinical improvement due to a local action directly into the mucosa and localized lymphoid areas, potentiating a local immune response rather than a systemic one. Therefore, while the SC protocol, based on pulsate cycles of higher doses of rFeIFN-x seems to have a relevant systemic role potentiating the innate immunity, the oral protocol suggests to act differently and directed in the local immune response. Considering the higher initial APP levels in the PO Group, this study alone is not sufficient to determine whether the licensed protocol is more potent in potentiating the innate-immune response or if this is simply the impact of the other factors such as living environment and better initial immune competence. Further studies namely the evaluation of cytokine profile expression namely proinflammatory ones (such as Interleukin-6, Interleukin-1 and Tumor Necrosis Factor) and its relation with the APP profile would clarify these major differences between groups.",

            "text": "A limitation of this study is the use of cats living in different environments. It seems reasonable to assume that animals from a shelter tend to be more exposed to conditions of higher morbidity than housed cats and, therefore, marked clinical improvement may be more likely when immune-modulation therapy is performed. However, recognizing that both protocols have different durations and routes of administration, a blinded study seemed unreasonable. More than simply comparing protocols, this study allowed us to assess the clinical improvement of cats individually with the baseline data of each cat also providing useful comparative information. Despite the heterogeneity of environments, initial clinical scores did not differ between groups, which made the SC Group a reliable positive control for clinical improvement assessment. Furthermore, having rFeIFN-x treated FIV-infected cats that had been previously studied in a single-arm trial permitted a reduction of the number of animals used for this research. However, in other parameters namely APPs, differences in groups on D0 are significant and reflect different basal immune status. Rather than house-hold cats, it seems reasonable to assume that cats from an animal shelter and living in catteries have different extrinsic factors that can affect the immune response. Therefore, particularly in these parameters, the positive group control is less reliable. Even though, APPs are intrinsically variable even in healthy cats, reason why it is recommended that the animal should act as its own reference (Ceron et al., 2005) . Then, more than comparing both groups, this study evaluated APP's tendency after the oral protocol, having the baseline values as the intrinsic own reference. This analysis minimized the initial discrepancy observed between groups. This is the first study describing the successful application of an oral rFeIFN-x protocol in symptomatic FIV-infected cats, opening new insights into more detailed immunological studies. It is highly probable that the licensed protocol provides sufficient levels of interferon systemically to induce a direct antiviral stimulus, in contrast to the oral protocol where systemic absorption is relatively limited and the doses used are also significantly lower. This may explain the apparently greater benefit of the injectable protocol in cats with an initially higher clinical score and in cats with high initial levels of virus shedding, and suggests that this should be taken into account when choosing the protocol for an individual cat in a clinical setting. Although the laboratory changes are subtler than those observed in the SC protocol, oral rFeIFN-x nevertheless resulted in a useful improvement of the animals' condition. Considering the significantly reduced cost of the product, it could be an interesting alternative for immunemodulation therapy of FIV-infected cats with a mild to moderate clinical presentation if the current licensed protocol is difficult to perform. Additionally, this may be an interesting option for treatment follow-up after the licensed protocol once the condition of the cat is better stabilized and secondary viral infections are better controlled.",
