[1] [2] [3] [4] Structure-based methods are now routinely used in almost all stages of drug development, from target identification to lead optimization. [5] [6] [7] [8] Central to all structure-based discovery approaches is the knowledge of the threedimensional (3D) structure of the target protein or complex because the structure and dynamics of the target determine which ligands it binds. The 3D structures of the target proteins are best determined by experimental methods that yield solutions at atomic resolution, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 9 While developments in the techniques of experimental structure determination have enhanced the applicability, accuracy, and speed of these structural studies, 10, 11 structural characterization of sequences remains an expensive and time-consuming task.",

Current statistics show that the structures available in the PDB account for less than 1% of the sequences in the UniProt database. 13 Moreover, the rate of growth of the sequence information is more than twice that of the structures, and is expected to accelerate even more with the advent of readily available next-generation sequencing technologies. Due to this wide sequence-structure gap, reliance on experimentally determined structures limits the number of proteins that can be targeted by structure-based drug discovery.",

The speed, low cost, and relative accuracy of these computational methods have led to the use of predicted 3D structures in the drug discovery process. 24, 25 The other class of prediction methods, de novo or ab initio methods, attempts to predict the structure from sequence alone, without reliance on evolutionary relationships. However, despite progress in these methods, [26] [27] [28] especially for small proteins with fewer than 100 amino acid residues, comparative modeling remains the most reliable method of predicting the 3D structure of a protein, with an accuracy that can be comparable to a low-resolution, experimentally determined structure. 9 The Basis of Comparative Modeling",

            "text": "As a natural extension, the profile-sequence alignment methods have led to profile-profile alignment methods that search for suitable template structures by scanning the profile of the target sequence against a database of template profiles, as opposed to a database of template sequences. These methods have proven to include the most sensitive and accurate fold assignment and Figure 2 Comparative protein structure modeling. (a) A flowchart illustrating the steps in the construction of a comparative model. 23 (b) Description of comparative modeling by extraction of spatial restraints as implemented in Modeller. 35 By default, spatial restraints in Modeller include: (1) homology-derived restraints from the aligned template structures; (2) statistical restraints derived from all known protein structures; and (3) stereochemical restraints from the CHARMM-22 molecular mechanics force field. These restraints are combined into an objective function that is then optimized to calculate the final 3D model of the target sequence. alignment protocols to date. 50, [55] [56] [57] Profile-profile methods detect $28% more relationships at the superfamily level and improve the alignment accuracy by 15-20% compared to profile-sequence methods. 50, 58 There are a number of variants of profile-profile alignment methods that differ in the scoring functions they use. 50, 55, [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] However, several analyses have shown that the overall performances of these methods are comparable. 50, [55] [56] [57] Some of the programs that can be used to detect suitable templates are FFAS, 65 SP3, 58 SALIGN, 50 HHBlits, 53 HHsearch, 52 and PPSCAN. 54 Sequence-structure threading methods As the sequence identity drops below the threshold of the twilight zone, there is usually insufficient signal in the sequences or their profiles for the sequence-based methods discussed above to detect true relationships. 48 Sequence-structure threading methods are most useful in this regime as they can sometimes recognize common folds, even in the absence of any statistically significant sequence similarity. 21 These methods achieve higher sensitivity by using structural information derived from the templates. The accuracy of a sequence-structure match is assessed by the score of a corresponding coarse model and not by sequence similarity, as in sequence comparison methods. 21 The scoring scheme used to evaluate the accuracy is either based on residue substitution tables dependent on structural features such as solvent exposure, secondary structure type, and hydrogen bonding properties, 58,66-68 or on statistical potentials for residue interactions implied by the alignment. [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] The use of structural data does not have to be restricted to the structure side of the aligned sequence-structure pair. For example, SAM-T08 makes use of the predicted local structure for the target sequence to enhance homolog detection and alignment accuracy. 74 Commonly used threading programs are GenTHREADER, 66,75 3D-PSSM, 76 FUGUE, 68 SP3, 58 SAM-T08 multitrack HMM, 67, 74, 77 and MUSTER. 78 Iterative sequence-structure alignment Yet another strategy is to optimize the alignment by iterating over the process of calculating alignments, building models, and evaluating models. Such a protocol can sample alignments that are not statistically significant and identify the alignment that yields the best model. Although this procedure can be time-consuming, it can significantly improve the accuracy of the resulting comparative models in difficult cases. 79 ",

However, it is important that a modeling method allows a degree of flexibility and automation to obtain better models more easily and rapidly. For example, a method should allow for an easy recalculation of a model when a change is made in the alignment; it should be straightforward to calculate models based on several templates; and the method should provide tools for incorporation of prior knowledge about the target (e.g., cross-linking restraints and predicted secondary structure).",

            "text": "Loop modeling is an especially important aspect of comparative modeling in the range from 30% to 50% sequence identity. In this range of overall similarity, loops among the homologs vary while the core regions are still relatively conserved and aligned accurately. Loops often play an important role in defining the functional specificity of a given protein, forming the active and binding sites. Loop modeling can be seen as a mini protein folding problem because the correct conformation of a given segment of a polypeptide chain has to be calculated mainly from the sequence of the segment itself. However, loops are generally too short to provide sufficient information about their local fold. Even identical decapeptides in different proteins do not always have the same conformation. 111, 112 Some additional restraints are provided by the core anchor regions that span the loop and by the structure of the rest of the protein that cradles the loop. Although many loop-modeling methods have been described, it is still challenging to correctly and confidently model loops longer than approximately 10-12 residues. 105, 113, 114 Two classes of methods There are two main classes of loop-modeling methods: (1) database search approaches that scan a database of all known protein structures to find segments fitting the anchor core regions 98, 115 ; and (2) conformational search approaches that rely on optimizing a scoring function. [116] [117] [118] There are also methods that combine these two approaches. 119, 120 Database-based loop modeling The database search approach to loop modeling is accurate and efficient when a database of specific loops is created to address the modeling of the same class of loops, such as b-hairpins, 121 or loops on a specific fold, such as the hypervariable regions in the immunoglobulin fold. 115, 122 There are attempts to classify loop conformations into more general categories, thus extending the applicability of the database search approach. [123] [124] [125] However, the database methods are limited because the number of possible conformations increases exponentially with the length of a loop, and until the late 1990s only loops up to 7 residues long could be modeled using the database of known protein structures. 126, 127 However, the growth of the PDB in recent years has largely eliminated this problem. 128 Optimization-based methods There are many optimization-based methods, exploiting different protein representations, objective functions, and optimization or enumeration algorithms. The search algorithms include the minimum perturbation method, 129 dihedral angle search through a rotamer library, 114,130 molecular dynamics simulations, 119, 131 genetic algorithms, 132 Monte Carlo and simulated annealing, [133] [134] [135] multiple-copy simultaneous search, 136 self-consistent field optimization, 137 robotics-inspired kinematic closure 138 and enumeration based on graph theory. 139 The accuracy of loop predictions can be further improved by clustering the sampled loop conformations and partially accounting for the entropic contribution to the free energy. 140 Another way of improving the accuracy of loop predictions is to consider the solvent effects. Improvements in implicit solvation models, such as the Generalized Born solvation model, motivated their use in loop modeling. The solvent contribution to the free energy can be added to the scoring function for optimization, or it can be used to rank the sampled loop conformations after they are generated with a scoring function that does not include the solvent terms. 105, [141] [142] [143] Side-Chain Modeling",

Second, most side chains in high-resolution crystallographic structures can be represented by a limited number of conformers that comply with stereochemical and energetic constraints. 146 This observation motivated Ponder and Richards 147 to develop the first library of side-chain rotamers for the 17 types of residues with dihedral angle degrees of freedom in their side chains, based on 10 high-resolution protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography. Subsequently, a number of additional libraries have been derived. [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] [153] [154] [155] Rotamers Rotamers on a fixed backbone are often used when all the side chains need to be modeled on a given backbone. This approach reduces the combinatorial explosion associated with a full conformational search of all the side chains, and is applied by some comparative modeling 86 and protein design approaches. 156 However, $ 15% of the side chains cannot be represented well by these libraries. 157 In addition, it has been shown that the accuracy of side-chain modeling on a fixed backbone decreases rapidly when the backbone errors are larger than 0.5 \u00c5 . 158 ",

The structural differences are sometimes not due to differences in sequence, but are a consequence of artifacts in structure determination or structure determination in different environments (e.g., packing of subunits in a crystal). The simultaneous use of several templates can minimize this kind of error. 83,84 Figure 3 Typical errors in comparative modeling. 23 Shown are the typical sources of errors encountered in comparative models. Two of the major sources of errors in comparative modeling are due to incorrect templates or incorrect alignments with the correct templates. The modeling procedure can rarely recover from such errors. The next significant source of errors arises from regions in the target with no corresponding region in the template, i.e., insertions or loops. Other sources of errors, which occur even with an accurate alignment, are due to rigid-body shifts, distortions in the backbone, and errors in the packing of side chains.",

However, when the sequence identity is lower, the first aspect of model evaluation is to confirm whether or not a correct template was used for modeling. It is often the case, when operating in this regime, that the fold assignment step produces only false positives. A further complication is that at such low similarities the alignment generally contains many errors, making it difficult to distinguish between an incorrect template on one hand and an incorrect alignment with a correct template on the other hand. There are several methods that use 3D profiles and statistical potentials, 70, 175, 176 which assess the compatibility between the sequence and modeled structure by evaluating the environment of each residue in a model with respect to the expected environment, as found in native high-resolution experimental structures. These methods can be used to assess whether or not the correct template was used for the modeling. They include VERIFY3D, 175 184 and TSVMod. 185 Even when the model is based on alignments that have >30% sequence identity, other factors, including the environment, can strongly influence the accuracy of a model. For instance, some calcium-binding proteins undergo large conformational changes when bound to calcium. If a calcium-free template is used to model the calcium-bound state of the target, it is likely that the model will be incorrect, irrespective of the target-template similarity or accuracy of the template structure. 186 ",

Each server then has 4 days to build and return a 3D model of these sequences. When PDB releases the structures, CAMEO compares the models against the experimentally determined structures, and presents the results on its web site.

It is often possible to predict correctly features of the target protein that do not occur in the template structure. 205, 206 For example, the size of a ligand may be predicted from the volume of the binding site cleft and the location of a binding site for a charged ligand can be predicted from a cluster of charged residues on the protein. Fortunately, errors in the functionally important regions in comparative models are many times relatively low because the functional regions, such as active sites, tend to be more conserved in evolution than the rest of the fold. Even low-accuracy comparative models may be useful, for example, for assigning the fold of a protein. Fold Figure 4 Accuracy and applications of protein structure models. 9 Shown are the different ranges of applicability of comparative protein structure modeling, threading, and de novo structure prediction, their corresponding accuracies, and their sample applications. assignment can be very helpful in drug discovery, because it can shortcut the search for leads by pointing to compounds that have been previously developed for other members of the same family. 207, 208 ",

[209] [210] [211] Comparative protein structure modeling extends the applicability of virtual screening beyond the atomic structures determined by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. In fact, comparative models have been used in virtual screening to detect novel ligands for many protein targets, 201 including the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), 210, [212] [213] [214] [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] [220] [221] [222] [223] protein kinases, [224] [225] [226] [227] nuclear hormone receptors, and many different enzymes. [228] [229] [230] [231] [232] [233] [234] [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] [241] Nevertheless, the relative utility of comparative models versus experimentally determined structures has only been relatively sparsely assessed. 212, 224, 225, [242] [243] [244] The utility of comparative models for molecular docking screens in ligand discovery has been documented 245 with the aid of 38 protein targets selected from the 'directory of useful decoys' (DUD). 246 For each target sequence, templates for comparative modeling were obtained from the PDB, including at least one holo (ligand bound) and one apo (ligand free) template structure for each of the eight 10% sequence identity ranges from 20% to 100%. In total, 222 models were generated based on 222 templates for the 38 test proteins using Modeller 9v2. 35 DUD ligands and decoys (98 266 molecules) were screened against the holo X-ray structure, the apo X-ray structure, and the comparative models of each target using DOCK 3.5.54. 247 The accuracy of virtual screening was evaluated by the overall ligand enrichment that was calculated by integrating the area under the enrichment plot (logAUC). A key result was that, for 63% and 79% of the targets, at least one comparative model yielded ligand enrichment better or comparable to that of the corresponding holo and apo X-ray structure. 245 This result indicates that comparative models can be useful docking targets when multiple templates are available. However, it was not possible to predict which model, out of all those used, led to the highest enrichment. Therefore, a 'consensus' enrichment score was computed by ranking each library compound by its best docking score against all comparative models and/or templates. For 47% and 70% of the targets, the consensus enrichment for multiple models was better or comparable to that of the holo and apo X-ray structures, respectively, suggesting that multiple comparative models can be useful for virtual screening.",

Li et al. 231 subsequently used similar methods to develop nanomolar inhibitors of falcipain that are active against chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria. In a study by Selzer et al. 232 comparative models were used to predict new nonpeptide inhibitors of cathepsin L-like cysteine proteases in Leishmania major. Sixty-nine compounds were selected by DOCK 3.5 as strong binders to a comparative model of protein cpB, and of these, 21 had experimental IC 50 values below 100 mmol l \u00c01 . Finally, in a study by Que et al., 240 comparative models were used to rationalize ligand-binding affinities of cysteine proteases in Entamoeba histolytica. Specifically, this work provided an explanation for why proteases ACP1 and ACP2 had substrate specificity similar to that of cathepsin B, although their overall structure is more similar to that of cathepsin D.",

The comparative model employed thrombin as the template, sharing only 34% sequence identity with the target sequence. Moreover, some residues in the binding site are significantly different; a trio of charged Asp residues in matriptase correspond to 1 Tyr and 2 Trp residues in thrombin. Thrombin was chosen as the template, in part because it prefers substrates with positively charged residues at the P1 position, as does matriptase. The National Cancer Institute database was used for virtual screening that targeted the S1 site with the DOCK program. The 2000 best-scoring compounds were manually inspected to identify positively charged ligands (the S1 site is negatively charged), and 69 compounds were experimentally screened for inhibition, identifying the 15 inhibitors. One of them, hexamidine, was used as a lead to identify additional compounds selective for matriptase relative to thrombin. The Wang group has also used similar methods to discover seven new, low-micromolar inhibitors of Bcl-2, using a comparative model based on the NMR solution structure of Bcl-X L . 233 Schapira et al. 249 discovered a novel inhibitor of a retinoic acid receptor by virtual screening using a comparative model. In this case, the target (RAR-a) and template (RAR-g) are very closely related; only three residues in the binding site are not conserved. The ICM program was used for virtual screening of ligands from the Available Chemicals Directory (ACD). The 5364 high-scoring compounds identified in the first round were subsequently docked into a full atom representation of the receptor with flexible side chains to obtain a final set of 300 good-scoring hits. These compounds were then manually inspected to choose the final 30 for testing. Two novel agonists were identified, with 50-nanomolar activity.",

            "text": "The applicability of structure-based modeling and virtual screening has recently been expanded to membrane proteins that transport solutes, such as ions, metabolites, peptides, and drugs. In humans, these transporters contribute to the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs, and often, mediate drug-drug interactions. Additionally, several transporters can be targeted directly by small molecules. For instance, methylphenidate (Ritalin) inhibiting the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and, consequently, inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine, is used in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 261 Schlessinger et al. 262 predicted 18 putative ligands of human NET by docking 6436 drugs from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes (KEGG DRUG) into a comparative model based on $25% sequence identity to leucine transporter (LeuT) from Aquifex aeolicus. Of these 18 predicted ligands, ten were validated by cis-inhibition experiments; five of them were chemically novel. Close examination of the predicted primary binding site helped rationalize interactions of NET with its primary substrate, norepineprhine, as well as positive and negative pharmacological effects of other NET ligands. Subsequently, Schlessinger et al. 263 modeled two different conformations of the human GABA transporter 2 (GAT-2), using the LeuT structures in occluded-outward-facing and outward-facing conformations. Enrichment calculations were used to assess the quality of the models in molecular dynamics simulations and side-chain refinements. The key residue, Glu48, interacting with the substrate was identified during the refinement of the models and validated by site-directed mutagenesis. Docking against two conformations of the transporter enriches for different physicochemical properties of ligands. For example, top-scoring ligands found by docking against the outward-facing model were bulkier and more hydrophobic than those predicted using the occluded-outward-facing model. Among twelve ligands validated in cis-inhibition assays, six were chemically novel (e.g., homotaurine). Based on the validation experiments, GAT-2 is likely to be a high-selectivity/low-affinity transporter. Following these two studies, a combination of comparative modeling, ligand docking, and experimental validation was used to rationalize toxicity of an anti-cancer agent, acivicin. 264 The toxic sideeffects are thought to be facilitated by the active transport of acivicin through the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) via the large-neutral amino acid Transporter 1 (LAT-1). In addition, four small-molecule ligands of LAT-1 were identified by docking against a comparative model based on two templates, the structures of the outward-occluded arginine-bound arginine/agmatine transporter AdiC from E. coli 265 and the inward-apo conformation of the amino acid, polyamine, and organo-cation transporter ApcT from Methanococcus jannaschii. 266 Two of the four hits, acivicin and fenclonine, were confirmed as substrates by a trans-stimulation assay. These studies clearly illustrate the applicability of combined comparative modeling and virtual screening to ligand discovery for transporters.",

Despite many years of development of molecular simulation methods, attempts to refine models that are already relatively close to the native structure have met with relatively little success. This failure is likely to be due in part to inaccuracies in the scoring functions used in the simulations, particularly in the treatment of electrostatics and solvation effects.

ZINC contains more than 21 million 'ready-to-dock' compounds organized in several subsets and allows the user to query the compounds by molecular properties and constitution. The Shoichet group also provides a DOCKBLASTER service 337 that enables end-users to dock the ZINC compounds against their target structures using DOCK. 247, 338 In the future, we will no doubt see efforts to improve the accuracy of comparative modeling and ligand docking. But perhaps as importantly, the two techniques will be integrated into a single protocol for more accurate and automated docking of ligands against sequences without known structures.
