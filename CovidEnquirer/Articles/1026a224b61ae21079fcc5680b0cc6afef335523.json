Possible explanations may be sought either in mechanisms altering the structure of the network of contacts, such as those induced by changes in the rates of movement of people or by public health measures, or in the genetic drift of the influenza virus, since the appearance of new strains can reduce or eliminate herd immunity. The pandemic outbreaks may also be influenced by coinfection with other acute respiratory infections (ARI) that increase transmissibility of influenza virus (by coughing, sneezing, running nose). In fact, some viruses (e.g., Rhinovirus and Adenovirus) have been found to induce ''clouds'' of bacteria and increase the transmissibility of Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, Rhinovirus and Adenovirus were detected in patients during past pandemics, and their presence is linked to superspreading events. In this paper, by assuming increased transmissibility in coinfected individuals, we propose and study a model where multiple pandemic waves are triggered by coinfection with ARI. The model agrees well with mortality excess data during the 1918 pandemic influenza, thereby providing indications for potential pandemic mitigation. 1 x x = x = J Fig. B1.

            "text": "As it was readily recognized, such behaviors pose a serious challenge to the simplest and most popular pandemic models. Of course, natural and political barriers can alter the structure of the contact networks, by possibly reducing interactions between infected and susceptible individuals, and thus delaying the course of the epidemics. While this effect may explain pandemic waves in wide areas (such as the US), its influence is much weaker when narrower areas are considered (e.g., at city level). Moreover, possible effects of containment/mitigation strategies may not be disregarded (Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007; Hatchett et al., 2007) , especially for more recent outbreaks. Other explanations for pandemic waves should be sought in the genetic variation of the influenza virus (Castillo-Chavez et al., 1989; Andreasen et al., 1997; Boni et al., 2004) , i.e., the appearance of new strains that could reduce or eliminate acquired immunity. However, the presence of more than one strain in the same pandemic outbreak has not been observed yet. Exogenous time changes in transmission rates, such as seasonal forcing, is a further candidate explanation (Colizza et al., 2006 (Colizza et al., , 2007 . While the role of seasonal forcing as a trigger of steady oscillations for endemic diseases, as measles, is well established (Fine and Clarkson, 1982) , and factors underlying the winter seasonality of influenza have been suggested (Hemmes et al., 1960) , the phenomenon can hardly be taken as a robust explanation of waves of pandemic flu (at least at local scale).",

            "text": "Alternative explanations can be advanced in a coinfection scenario (May and Nowak, 1995; Adler and Losada, 2002) . For instance, can other acute respiratory infections (ARI), such as Rhinovirus and Adenovirus, be responsible for increasing transmissibility (e.g., by coughing, sneezing, running nose) of pandemic influenza? If this is the case, coinfection with ARI could also be responsible for epidemic waves, for instance when the dynamics of the influenza pandemic and the ARI are not synchronized. Recent works support this hypothesis. In fact, the presence of respiratory pathologies not directly linked to the pandemic virus has been detected in most of past pandemic episodes. In particular, Rhinovirus and Adenovirus were detected in patients during past pandemic events (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Brundage, 2006) . Moreover, superspreading episodes (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005) , potentially linked to coinfection events, were detected in all these cases (Brundage, 2006) . Superspreading events in SARS might also be caused by coinfection with other respiratory viruses (Bassetti et al., 2005a) . The mechanism was also identified as responsible for increased transmission of Staphylococcus aureus (Bassetti et al., 2005b) . Additional (though indirect) support to the coinfection scenario can be drawn from a recently advanced proposal (Edwards et al., 2004) , according to which alteration of the lung airway surface properties by inhaled nontoxic aerosols is an effective strategy to contain the amount of exhaled bioaerosol, thus mitigating the spread of airborne infectious diseases.",

The quantities A\u00f0J\u00de and B\u00f0J\u00de are reproduction numbers themselves: A\u00f0J\u00de characterizes the situation where the susceptible pool is fully composed by individuals free from ARI, whereas B\u00f0J\u00de characterizes the situation where the susceptible pool is fully composed by individuals infected by ARI. Both A\u00f0J\u00de and B\u00f0J\u00de are increasing in J. Moreover B\u00f0J\u00de4A\u00f0J\u00de holds for all J and as J increases the composition of the susceptible pool is modified by increasing the percentage of susceptible with ARI. Therefore R e is an increasing function of the prevalence of ARI, suggesting that even if at the end of an epidemic wave R e is below 1, it may well go above threshold at subsequent times as a consequence of the growing dynamics of ARI.

Variability in the average duration of infectious periods of both influenza and ARI allowed us to estimate confidence intervals for all the other epidemiological parameters. Moreover, we assumed t ari 0 4t 0 . Since the basic reproductive number the fall wave can be estimated from the data through the equation R 0 \u00bc 1 \u00fe r=g, where r is the intrinsic growth rate, and R 0 for system (1) in absence of ARI is b=g (see Eq. (5)), we estimated the transmission rate of influenza as b \u00bc r \u00fe g. We fix the initial number of infected individuals by influenza and by ARI to 1. The other model parameters, namely transmission rate for ARI, a, transmission rate for influenza in coinfected individuals, r, death rate, , initial time for influenza, t 0 , and initial time for ARI, t ari 0 were estimated through least squares fitting to the number of influenza deaths over time. By sampling g and d from their respective gamma distributions, 500 different model realizations were employed to estimate confidence intervals for the model parameters. Fig. 4a shows the comparison between the observed data and the model predictions (coefficient of determination: R 2 \u00bc 0:82, 95% CI (0.79, 0.84)). Some of the discrepancies between the fit and the data can of course be due to phenomena not accounted for by the model. This may well be the case for the observed difference in slope in the decay phase of the first wave. The poor fit observed may be due to military demobilization at the end of the first world war (Ferguson et al., 2006) that makes the data uncompliant with any classical SIR model (by eliminating these points from the computation, we obtain an average estimate of R 2 \u00bc 0:93). The discrepancy in the height of the first peak can be better explained as an effect of our choices-namely, to have estimated the transmission parameter, b, from the intrinsic growth rate r, instead of leaving it as a free parameter to be estimated by least squares fit. The average value of the reproduction number of influenza for the first wave is R 0 \u00bc 1:58 (see Fig. 4b ). Transmission parameter for class I I is in average 3.1 times that of class I S (see Fig. 4c ) and 1.7 times that of ARI (see Fig. 4d ). The cumulative attack rate is estimated to be 63% at the end of the first wave and 85.4% at the end of the second wave. Proportion of deaths is estimated to be slightly lower than 1%.",
