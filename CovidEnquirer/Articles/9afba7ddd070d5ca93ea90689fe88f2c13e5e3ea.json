The reoviruses of mammalian origin have been divided into three serotypes, although cross-reactions occur. Serological surveys conducted in various parts of the world have indicated that reovirus infections are widely distributed in cattle and sheep populations. Nevertheless, there is still little evidence for the implication of reoviruses as pathogens of the respiratory or alimentary tracts of either species, particularly when compared with the effects produced with other known disease agents.",

Reoviruses are likely to initiate tissue damage in the respiratory tract, thereby enabling secondary agents to invade and replicate to advantage. In the case of the alimentary tract, their role as pathogens is even less well defined.",

The human isolates of all three serotypes are evidently indistinguishable from those recovered from animals, but the five described serotypes of avian origin form a separate group. Strains of reoviruses within the three types recovered from various animal species have usually proved to be indistinguishable, and will apparently cross the species barrier. Human strains of types 1 and 2 have been shown capable of infecting calves . All three reovirus serotypes possess two group-specific antigens in common; each type possesses a type-specific antigen as determined by immunodiffusion. However, immunoelectrophoretic analysis indicates that the reoviral antigens can be further resolved into four group-specific and two type-specific antigens.",

Whereas calves were evidently protected on one farm, antibody titers fell sharply on another. The work of Philip et al. (1973) was extended by Morzaria et al.
