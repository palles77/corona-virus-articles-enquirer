            "text": "A B S T R A C T Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haploHSCT) with conditioning regimens using posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts is limited by comparably higher rates of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) may mitigate this risk. We evaluated haploHSCT after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) with ATG, PTCy, and cyclosporine to prevent rejection and GVHD. Fifty adults underwent haploHSCT from August 2016 to February 2018. RIC included fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 /day on days \u00c05 to \u00c02), busulfan (3.2 mg/m 2 /day on days \u00c03 and \u00c02), and total body irradiation (200 cGy) on day \u00c01. Unmanipulated PBSCs were infused on day 0. GVHD prophylaxis included ATG (4.5 mg/kg over days \u00c03 to \u00c01), PTCy (50 mg/kg/day on days +3 and +4), and cyclosporine from day +5. Median age was 56 years (range, 22 to 70 years); 25 (73.5%) patients were in first complete remission (CR1), 5 (14.7%) were in second complete remission (CR2), and 8 (23.5%) had active disease. Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 16 days (range, 8 to 43 days). At day +100, the cumulative incidence of acute GVHD of any grade, and grades III to IV was 38.3% and 5.2%, respectively. Mild chronic GVHD was seen in 15.5%. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation occurred in 37 (74%) cases and CMV disease occurred in 4 (11.5%) cases. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation occurred in 21 (61.8%) patients. The incidence of histologically confirmed post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) was 5.8%. Four patients received rituximab. There were no CMV, EBV, or PTLD-related deaths. Six-month and 1-year overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 73.9%, 10.2%, and 19.4%, respectively, and 48.1%, 16% and 38.2%, respectively. Infection was the most common cause of death (18%). Unmanipulated haploidentical PBSC transplantation following RIC with ATG, PTCy, and cyclosporine as a GVHD prevention strategy results in low rates of acute and chronic GVHD.",

            "text": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for patients with high-risk or advanced hematological disorders [1] . An HLAmatched sibling donor is considered the first choice. Approximately 70% of patients do not have a suitably matched sibling donor (MSD) available for transplantation. Alternatives such as matched unrelated donors (MUDs) can be identified for only 50% to 60% of patients, with the donor search and procurement process requiring a median of 4 months [2] . For patients who do not have suitable MSDs or MUDs, alternative stem cell sources include unrelated single or double umbilical cord blood transplants, HLA-mismatched unrelated donors (MMUDs), and HLA haploidentical family members. Despite the expansion of MUD registries and cord blood banks, donor availability can often be uncertain particularly for under-represented ethnic minorities, which may be subject to prolonged and unproductive registry searches [3] . The use of haploidentical donors reduces this uncertainty to a large degree, as almost all patients have an immediately available related donor with whom they share a single HLA haplotype. This not only facilitates a reduced time to transplantation, but also provides a more reliable source of donor There remains considerable variation between centers in conditioning regimens, graft sources and choice of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis to achieve lower nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and optimum long-term outcomes in haploidentical HSCT (haploHSCT). The combination of a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and post-transplant high-dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) has only been described in the setting of haploHSCT for sickle cell disease [4] . In our institution, we established a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen consisting of fludarabine (Flu), reduced-dose busulfan (Bu), and total body irradiation (TBI) (total dose 200 cGy) combined with ATG and followed by PTCy and cyclosporine for the prevention of graft rejection and GVHD for haploHSCT recipients. We previously reported the use of this protocol in MUD transplants wherein lower rates of severe acute GVHD were demonstrated compared with non\u00c0ATG-based regimens [5] . In the present study, we report the use of this protocol in 50 consecutive patients who underwent haploHSCT at our center.",

This was historically associated with high rates of graft rejection, severe acute GVHD, and worse outcomes when compared with MSD transplants [9] . An important milestone in haploHSCT was the use of T cell\u00c0replete grafts in combination with posttransplantation high-dose cyclophosphamide [10] . In the setting of haploHSCT, PTCy decreases the risk of GVHD and graft rejection by targeting and inducing cell apoptosis of alloreactive T cells rapidly proliferating early after transplant, sparing regulatory T cells and preserving nondividing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells [10\u00c013]. PTCy may be associated with high rates of severe acute GVHD if used alone, with 4 of 5 patients receiving single-agent PTCy succumbing to fatal, steroid-refractory GVHD in 1 single-center report [14] . Therefore, post-transplant immunosuppression commonly includes additional agents such as calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus, and/or mycophenolate mofetil [13, 14] . HaploHSCT using unmanipulated T cell\u00c0replete PBSC grafts with PTCy, calcineurin inhibitors, and mycophenolate mofetil as GVHD prophylaxis have been associated with increased rates of acute and chronic GVHD and have shown commensurate outcomes with acceptable NRM when compared with other donor sources [12, 15, 16] . ATG has also been extensively studied as a method to prevent graft rejection, acute GVHD, and chronic GVHD in MSD and MUD transplants [17\u00c019]. However, its effectiveness in modulating severe acute and chronic GVHD is offset by a higher rate of infectious complications, including CMV and EBV reactivation [20\u00c022] .",

The combination of fludarabine and busulfan with PTCy may potentiate the antineoplastic activity of the conditioning regimen which may lead to resulting in further disease reduction. Data in HaploHSCT using RIC and PBSC as the stem cell source is limited. Additionally, centers using PBSC in haploidentical transplants have shown rates of extensive chronic GVHD as high as 38% [16] . The combination of ATG and low dose PTCy was found to increase regulatory T cell reconstitution in an animal model leading to lower rates of acute GVHD in a murine experiment [26] . Our own experience with this combination in MUD transplants led to its use in the haploHCT setting [5] . We had also encountered a high incidence of severe acute and chronic GVHD with RIC for MSD and MUD transplants [27] . This led to a concerted effort to design a conditioning regimen that would reduce both acute and chronic GVHD.",

Based on European data, the incidence of PTLD after allogeneic HSCT was 3.2%, varying from 1.2% in MUDs to 2.8% in mismatched related donors (including haploidentical and mismatched related donors). In the context of ATG-based conditioning, the incidence of PTLD has been reported to be 9.7% [31] . The risk of developing EBV-PTLD is predominantly related to the degree of T cell depletion or impairment, as EBV-infected B cells are held in check by cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes. This loss of this mechanism leads to uncontrolled B cell proliferation and the development of PTLD [32] . Although the incidence of EBV reactivation and PTLD in our patients was high, all patients responded well to rituximab monotherapy and no PTLDrelated deaths occurred. The observed high rate of EBV reactivation and PTLD may be attributed to T cell impairment between donor and recipient secondary to HLA mismatch, the use of dual T cell depletion with PTCy and ATG, and the high rate of CMV reactivation. Patients were monitored closely with weekly PCR-based testing for EBV. This may have led to a higher rate of detection of EBV reactivation. EBV seromismatch has been described as a risk factor for PTLD development, and the selection of an EBV-matched donor may affect rates of reactivation in a manner similar to CMV [31] . There are no clear guidelines for the monitoring and preemptive treatment of EBV reactivation or PTLD in haploHSCT.",

While a longer follow-up would certainly be more informative for outcomes such as chronic GVHD and longerterm complications, the lower incidence of acute GVHD grade II to IV was encouraging. The incidence of NRM was of considerable concern and has been attributed to infective complications, particularly after viral infections. We have implemented a reduction in the ATG dose in an attempt to mitigate the infection risk. Finally, the proportion of older (35% over 65 years of age) patients may explain lower tolerance to infectious and other post-transplant complications. Future modifications to this protocol may also include more aggressive antiviral prophylaxis and therapy.",

This approach produced consistent donor cell engraftment with low rates of acute GVHD; however, this was tempered by high rates of viral reactivation and consequently, NRM.
