Three colostrum-deprived Holstein calves were housed separately in individual rooms of a high-containment facility and inoculated with the BCoV strain Kumamoto/1/07. Until the end of the experiment (1,085, 700 and 280 days, respectively), viral RNAs were detected sporadically by RT-PCR and nested PCR from plasma, nasal discharge, and feces. Seroconversion and titer changes were validated by hemagglutination inhibition tests and neutralization tests. Among the samples, nasal discharge showed a higher viral positivity than feces, which seemed to be associated with positive detection in the plasma. These data demonstrate the existence of persistent infection of BCoV in the respiratory tissues of cattle.",

After incubation, the serum-virus mixture was transferred onto monolayered human rectal tumor cells (HRT-18G) cultured in microplates and incubated for 5 days at 37\u00b0C. The neutralization antibody titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE).",

Thereafter, the titers gradually decreased. However, both titers showed a rapid rise at 421 dpi in calf 1 (640 and 724, respectively) (Fig. 1A ). Ten days before the sampling, calf 1 showed diarrhea at 411 and 412 dpi (data not shown). Therefore, we surmised that the virus was reactivated in the cattle, probably in the respiratory tissues, causing diarrhea followed by this booster effect. The virus in the digestive tract might have been quickly inactivated and excreted; therefore, viral RNAs were not detected from nasal discharge and feces at 421 dpi, 10 days after the onset. Unfortunately, feces samples had not been collected at the onset, so no virus was isolated. A rapid rise in these titers was also found in calf 2 at 632 dpi, just after the detection of viral RNA from the plasma at 617 dpi by both RT-PCR and nested PCR (Fig. 1B) . This finding might also be attributed to virus reactivation in respiratory tissues and quick inactivation by host immunity without clinical signs. This study showed that the BCoV RNA was long-lasting, having been detected from the nasal discharge of cattle that had been maintained in an isolated room of a high-containment facility to prevent virus intrusion from outside. This indicated the existence of persistent infection of BCoV in the respiratory tissues of cattle, although further investigations are warranted because the virus was not isolated. Other coronaviruses, such as Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, Canine coronavirus, and Feline coronavirus, have also been reported to cause long-term infection [8, 21, 22] . Thus, coronavirus tends to cause persistent infection in host animals. Often, calf diarrhea caused by BCoV repeatedly occurs at the same farm every year. This might be explained by the presence of persistently infected cattle.",

The days when the viral RNA was detected from the plasma, nasal discharge, and feces are indicated by green, violet, and orange bars, respectively. The numbers in parentheses indicate weeks post inoculation. The half-size bar showed that the viral RNA was detected only by nested PCR. The antibody titers measured in the HI and VN tests are on the left y-axes. The period of disease onset is indicated by the black bar.doi: 10.1292/jvms.18-0050",
