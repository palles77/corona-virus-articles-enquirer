Experimentally, secretory proteins can be prevented from achieving their native folded conformations by mutation (Doms et al., 1988; Cheng et al., 1990) , expression of single subunits of multisubunit complexes (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1988; Wikstrom and Lodish, 1992) , or by inhibition of glycosylation or disulfide bond formation (Olden et al., 1979; Braakman et al., 1992) . In all of these cases, failure either to fold or to oligomerize properly causes the protein to be retained intracellularly, most often in the ER, and then to be degraded. The capacity of the cell to retain and to degrade unfolded or unassembled secretory proteins constitutes a quality control process that prevents secretion of defective gene products to the cell surface and allows for the salvage of amino acids from nonfunctional proteins (de Silva et al., 1990; McCracken and Brodsky, 1996) .",

We chose as a test protein the 92-amino acid NH2-terminal DNA-binding domain of the phage k repressor. Crystallographic and biochemical analyses have shown that the NH2-terminal domain of h repressor is a compact globular structure without solvent-exposed hydrophobic regions or flexible strands that might be recognized as unfolded substrate (Pabo and Lewis, 1982) . Moreover, folding of the repressor domain in the ER lumen should not be impeded by inappropriate disulfide bond formation or carbohydrate addition since the amino acid sequence does not contain cysteine residues or potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. The effect of unfolding of the NH2-terminal domain of k repressor can be tested using mutants that reduce the thermal stability of the protein. For most of our work, we use a Leu 57 to Ala mutation that reduces the hydrophobicity of the core of the folded protein, thereby lowering the temperature of 50% thermal denaturation (Tin) 1 from 54 to 20\u00b0C for the purified NH2-terminal domain (Parsell and Saucr, 1989) .",

Invertase confers several useful properties on the fusion proteins. First, transport of invertase from the ER to the Golgi can be detected by the extension of N-linked carbohydrate chains that occurs in the Golgi (Esmon et al., 1981) . Second, addition of polypeptide sequences to the COOH terminus of invertase does not interfere with folding of the active enzyme, allowing enzymatic assays to be performed to quantitate the amount of active fusion protein. Finally, once it has folded, dimeric invertase is remarkably stable (Gascon et al., 1968) , allowing the invertase moiety to be used as a marker for the fate of the fusion protein, even under circumstances where the h repressor sequences are degraded.",

This finding indicated a retention process within the secretory pathway that was able to discriminate between wild-type and mutant versions of the repressor domain. Previous work had shown that either additional peptide sequences or an uncleaved signal sequence at the NH2 terminus of invertase causes invertase to be retained in the ER (Schauer et al., 1985; Kaiser et al., 1987; Bohni et al., 1988) . We expected that misfolded peptide sequences at the COOH terminus of invertase would similarly cause retention in the ER. Instead, we find that the fusion proteins bearing mutant repressor sequences are transported from the ER and then diverted to the vacuole by a receptor-mediated targeting process.",

The h repressor constructs were amplified by PCR using the following primers: (5'-CTC AAG ACC CGT TTA GAG GCC CCA AGG GG-3') complementary to the 3' end and (5'-GGT GAG ATC TCA AGC ACA AAA AAG AAA CCA TTA ACA C-3') complementary to the 5' end and which introduces a BgllI site (bold). The BgllI fragment from the amplified product containing the h repressor, epitope, and tag was inserted into pEHB9 at the end of the SUC2 coding sequence to produce: pEHB43 [Inv-(N) clwt], pEHB44 [Inv-(N) ClLsvA], pEHB51 [Inv-(N) clL570], and pEHB53 [Inv-(N) ClLAoA ]. The 4.3-kb SalI-SacI fragment containing Inv-(N)ClL57A from pEHB44 was cloned into the highcopy vector pRS306-2V, to produce pEHB55.",

Most of the invertase activity from Inv-(N)clwt was extracellular, indicating successful secretion of this protein to the cell surface. To estimate the fraction of Inv-(N)clwt that is secreted, it was necessary to subtract the contribution to intracellular activity made by the constitutive, cytoplasmic form of invertase expressed from the SUC2 promoter (Carlson et al., 1983) . This quantity should be equal to the intracellular invertase activity expressed from the wild-type SUC2 gene, since in steady state most of the intracellular activity is due to the cytoplasmic form of the enzyme. When this quantity of the cytoplasmic form of the fusion protein was subtracted from the total pool of activity for Inv-(N)Clwt, an overall efficiency of secretion to the cell surface of 67% was obtained (Table II) .",

Disruption of the PEP4 gene (in CKY414) largely blocked proteolysis of Inv-(N)clL57A, implicating vacuolar proteases in the degradation of the repressor moiety (Fig. 3, lane 4) . Similarly, the pep4A mutation blocked degradation of Inv-(N)ClL57~, Inv-(N)ClLAGA, and the intracellular form of Inv-(N)clwt (data not shown). Targeting of Inv-(N)ClL57A to the vacuole was further supported by cytological examination of the intracellular location of the fusion protein.

While there is no precedent for such a quality control system for sorting soluble proteins at this step of the secretory pathway, there are several examples where nonnative membrane proteins are segregated to the vacuole (Gaynor et al., 1994; Chang and Fink, 1995) . Although the sequence of the NH2-terminal domain of k repressor is not overly hydrophobic, the unfolded repressor domain may have assumed some of the properties of an integral membrane protein. To address this possibility, we examined the affinity that Inv-(N)CIL57A and Inv-(N)cIwt have for membranes. The comparison of membrane association was made in a sec12 mutant (CKY407) at the restrictive temperature to prevent vacuolar degradation of the repressor moiety of Inv-(N)CIL57A and to make the comparison for binding to the same membrane, namely that of the ER. Spheroplast pellets were vigorously lysed to disrupt the ER, and lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 g to separate membranes from the soluble proteins. Wild-type invertase, used as a control, was present mostly in the supernatant, as expected for a soluble secretory protein (Fig. 5, lanes 1-3) . Similarly, most of Inv-(N)clwt and Inv-(N)clL57A fractionated in the supernatant, confirming that both hybrid proteins also behave as soluble proteins (Fig. 5, lanes 4--6 and 7-9) . Thus, in cell extracts, the mutant repressor domain of Inv-(N)clL57A does not increase the propensity of the protein to associate with membranes, and therefore sorting to the vacuole most likely takes place in the lumen and not the membrane of the Golgi.",

            "text": "Complicating this analysis is the finding that the extracellular invertase from overexpressed Inv-(N)clL57A was present in two forms: a form that comigrated with the undegraded intracellular fusion in a pep4A strain (Fig. 6,   lane 4) , and a partially truncated form that migrates more slowly than the truncated protein in the vacuole (Fig. 6 , lane 5). This partially truncated form was sometimes detected to a much lesser extent in the extracellular fraction of both wild-type and pep4A strains expressing Inv-(N)CIL57A in low copy (Fig. 7, lane 3) . The small amount of partially truncated Inv-(N)clL57A in the spheroplast pellet of CKY414 (Fig. 7, lane 4) was probably due to incomplete spheroplasting, and this band was not visible in similar experiments. Since the partially truncated form was found in spheroplast supernatants, we suspected that Inv-(N)ClL57A was being exposed to periplasmic proteases once the fusion protein reached the cell surface. Presumably, this partially truncated species was not generated when hybrid protein containing wild-type repressor was expressed at the cell surface because of the relative stability of the wildtype repressor domain. As expected for a degradation process that occurred only on the cell surface, none of the partially truncated form of the hybrid protein was detected when transport to the cell surface of overexpressed Inv-(N)ClL57A was blocked in a secl mutant at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 6, lanes 7 and 8) .

CKY406 (wild type) (lanes 1 and 2) and CKY414 (pep4za) (lanes 3 and 4) expressing pEHB44 [Inv-(N)clL57A-CEN] and CKY406 (wt) (lanes 5 and 6) and CKY413 (secl-1) (lanes 7 and 8) expressing pEHB55 [Inv-(N)ClL57A-2tX] were induced for invertase expression at 30\u00b0C (37\u00b0C for secl-1) and spheroplasted to separate the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions. Extracts were digested with Endo H and resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, and invertase was visualized by Western blotting using invertase antiserum. The protein amount in the fractions derived from expression of Inv-(N)clL57A-211, lanes 5-8, represent one-fifth of the protein loaded in lanes 1-4. length fusion protein and the truncated fusion protein produced by vacuolar proteolysis that comigrates with wildtype invertase (Fig. 6, lane 8) . We originally suspected that the partial truncation of the fusion protein on the cell surface resulted from the action of proteases in the lytic enzyme preparation used for spheroplasting. However, this did not appear to be the case since the partially truncated fusion protein was detected in cell lysates that were prepared by mechanical disruption without the use of lytic enzymes. Attempts to eliminate the extracellular proteolysis of [nv-(N) clL57A by adding the protease inhibitors PMSF and leupeptin to cultures during invertase induction and spheroplasting also failed to prevent formation of the partially truncated fusion protein. We conclude that both the full-length and partially truncated proteins represent Inv-( N ) c l L 5 7 A secreted to the cell surface during overexpression, most likely resulting from saturation of a receptormediated targeting system that sorts Inv-(N)CIL57A to the vacuole.",

The vacuole is charplast supernatant, compared to 20% in a wild-type strain (CKY406) expressing Inv-(N)ClL57A (Table III) . On Western blots of vpslOA strains, almost all of the mutant repressor fusions were present in the extracellular fraction (Fig. 7 , lanes 5, 7, and 9) with very little fusion protein retained intracellularly (Fig. 7, lanes 6, 8, and 10) . Similar to the case when Inv-(N)clL57A was overexpressed, two forms of the extracellular fusion protein were seen: a full-length fusion that comigrates with undegraded intracellular fusion in a pep4A strain (Fig. 7, lane 4) and the partially truncated form derived from proteolysis of the full-length fusion in the periplasmic space (Fig. 7, lanes 5, 7, and 9) . Thus, in a vpslOA strain, about as much fusion protein bearing mutant repressor domains reached the cell surface as fusions bearing the wild-type repressor in a wild-type strain. However, the majority of the hybrid protein bearing mutant repressor domains that reach the cell surface in vpslOzl are then partially degraded by an unknown extracellular protease to yield partially truncated forms of the hybrid protein. These results demonstrate that Vpsl0p is required to target the mutant repressor fusions to the vacuole.",

            "text": "A large body of both published experimental data and unpublished observations indicates that incorrectly folded proteins or incompletely assembled protein complexes are usually degraded within the secretory pathway before they can reach the cell surface. In an effort to understand how cells discriminate between correctly and incorrectly folded proteins, we designed a system to determine the fate of the NHz-terminal domain of k repressor protein within the secretory pathway of S. cerevisiae. The repressor protein domain was chosen because of its compact globular structure and the availability of mutations that cause thermal denaturation of this domain. Invertase fused to the NH2terminal wild-type repressor domain passes through the E R and reaches the cell surface as a full-length fusion protein, demonstrating that the wild-type repressor domain acterized by its content of proteases and other degradative enzymes, which under conditions of nutrient deprivation, mediates much of the protein turnover in a yeast cell (Teichert et al., 1989) . Several different pathways have been identified by which proteins can be targeted to the vacuole for degradation. A number of membrane proteins, including pheromone receptors and permeases, whose abundance in the plasma membrane is regulated, are removed from the plasma membrane and transported to the vacuole for degradation via the endocytic pathway (Davis et al., 1993; Berkower et al., 1994; Schandel and Jenness, 1994; Volland et al., 1994; Hicke and Riezman, 1996) . A second path for protein import into the vacuole is autophagocytosis where, in response to nutrient deprivation, portions of the cytosol and organelles are engulfed and degraded by the vacuole (Takeshige et al., 1992) . Autophagocytosis and direct translocation across the vacuolar membrane have been proposed as mechanisms for vacuolar degradation of the cytosolic enzymes fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and the 13 subunit of fatty acid synthase (Chiang and Schekman, 1991; Egner et al., 1993; Schork et al., 1994) . Finally, in a number of cases, mutant membrane proteins have been shown to be targeted to the vacuole. These include mutants of the plasma membrane ATPase that are directed to the vacuole rather than the plasma membrane (Chang and Fink, 1995) , a hybrid protein composed of the transmembrane domain of the ER membrane protein Wbplp fused to invertase (Gaynor et al., 1994) , and mutants of the late-Golgi protease Kex2, which disrupt the Golgi retention signal located in the cytosolic tail (Wilcox et al., 1992 ). An apparently analogous process for the degradation of incorrectly assembled membrane protein complexes has been observed in mammalian cells, where the Golgi coronavirus E1 protein and excess a-13 and 8 subunits of the T cell receptor complex were shown to be substantially stabilized by treatment of cells with agents that inhibit lysosomal proteases (Minami et al., 1987; Armstrong et al., 1990) .",

We considered the possibility that targeting of invertase fusions to the vacuole may occur by a mechanism similar to that described for mutant membrane proteins. Although the repressor sequence is quite hydrophilic, it seemed possible that unfolding of the repressor domain might expose hydrophobic regions of the protein that are normally buried and convert the hybrid protein into a membrane protein. We experimentally addressed this possibility by testing the solubility of fusions to mutant and wild-type repressor domains and found both to be as soluble as wild-type invertase. The most convincing evidence that the fusions to the mutant repressor are sorted by a process that occurs in the Golgi lumen as opposed to the Golgi membrane is the dependence of vacuolar targeting on Vpsl0p, a membrane protein shown to sort luminal proteins (Fig. 8 b) .",

The interaction between Vpsl0p and the ligand sequence in the pro-region of CPY has been extensively studied. Four contiguous amino acid residues Q24-R-P-L27 in the pro-region of CPY define the sequence required for interaction with Vpsl0p as identified by deletion mapping and mutational studies (Johnson et al., 1987; Valls et al., 1990) .

            "text": "Vpsl0p is also capable of acting as a vacuolar targeting receptor for proteins that do not have the QRPL determinant. Mutational analysis of the QRPL sequence in the proregion of CPY revealed a tolerance for many different amino acid substitutions, especially at positions R 25 and p26, that show only a slight defect in the sorting of CPY to the vacuole (van Voorst et al., 1996) . Vpsl0p has also been shown to be partly responsible for targeting proPrA to the vacuole (Cooper and Stevens, 1996; Westphal et al., 1996) . Vpsl0p apparently recognizes the pro-region of proPrA since a hybrid protein composed of the pro-region fused to invertase is targeted to the vacuole in a Vpsl0p-dependent manner (Klionsky et al., 1988; Westphal et al., 1996) , despite the fact that the pro-region of PrA does not contain QRPL or related sequences. Thus, recognition of luminal vacuolar proteins by Vpsl0p can apparently involve a wide variety of sequence determinants, some of which may have the qualities of unfolded polypeptides instead of a specific peptide motif. The degeneracy of vacuolar sorting signals in general, and Vpsl0p ligands in particular, suggests that one aspect of vacuolar sorting signals may be an extended flexible polypeptide that can be encompassed by a large number of sequences with little common primary sequence. Indeed, spectroscopic evaluation of the conformation of the pro-region of CPY expressed in E. coli revealed that the pro-region assumes a flexible conformation with little regular secondary structure (Sorensen et al., 1993) . It is therefore possible that accessibility to an extended polypeptide chain in an unfolded state may be part of the mechanism by which Vpsl0p binds to its ligands.",

            "text": "Although it is possible that the repressor missense mutations alter the primary structure so as to fortuitously create short peptide sequences that are recognized as vacuolar targeting signals, we greatly favor the interpretation that the mutations generate a more general type of vacuolar targeting signal by causing the repressor domain to be unfolded. The repressor folding defect caused by the Leu 57 to Ala mutation is partially suppressed by second-site mutations at two Gly residues that have been shown to increase the Tm of the NHz-terminal domain of h repressor by 6-8\u00b0C (Hecht et al., 1986; Reidhaar-Olsen et al., 1990) . Introduction of these mutations reduces the ability of the corresponding invertase fusion to be targeted to the vacuole, giving direct evidence that retention of the fusion proteins is related to the effect that the sequence alterations have on protein folding and stability. As a control to show that vacuolar targeting was not simply a consequence of changing Leu 57, we tested another destabilizing repressor mutation that contains an amino acid change at a different position, Leu 69 to Gly, which similarly lowers the Tm of the NH2-terminal domain measured in vitro (Sauer, R.T., unpublished observations). The corresponding invertase fusion of this mutant was also targeted to the vacuole, em-phasizing that unfolded determinants are key in redirecting the mutant hybrids. Finally, the ability of unfolded polypeptides to specify vacuolar targeting appears to be quite general since invertase molecules with randomly generated amino acid sequences appended to the COOH terminus also specify targeting of the fusion protein to the vacuole (Hong, E., A. Davidson, M. Cordes, and C. Kaiser, unpublished observations). These results suggest that there is a general mechanism by which cells can recognize misfolded proteins for targeting to the vacuole.",

We tested the idea that Inv-(N)clLsTA binds to the same site on Vpsl0p as proCPY by determining whether overexpression of Inv-(N)clL57A can cause secretion of proCPY into the extracellular medium. No effect on CPY secretion was seen when Inv-(N)ClL57A was expressed from a 2p, plasmid. Similarly, in the converse experiment, overexpression of CPY did not result in an increased level of Inv-(N)clL57A at the cell surface. This apparent absence of competition leads us to conclude that the repressor sequences and proCPY bind to different sites on the luminal domain of Vpsl0p.",

Initially, we expected that additional sequences that assume an unfolded conformation appended to the COOH terminus of invertase would also cause a similar retention in the ER. It appears that neither the wild-type repressor domain nor the mutant repressors possess the sequence or structural characteristics that elicit ER retention. Possibly the repressor sequences are not as hydrophobic as signal sequences, and hydrophobicity may be an important determinant for ER retention, whether by association with chaperone cofactors or binding to the ER membrane. Thus, there appear to be at least two different stages at which proteins that are not correctly folded are segregated from normally folded proteins en route to the cell surface. Retention of misfolded proteins in the ER would allow additional opportunities for folding in the presence of chaperones such as BiP and PDI to take place. Eventually, if folding cannot be completed in the ER, it would be advantageous to rid the cell of these polypeptides and to recover the amino acids. Clearly one way to accomplish this would be to have a mechanism whereby misfolded proteins are allowed to leave the ER but are then targeted to the vacuole for degradation. The mutant repressor sequences do not appear to have the characteristics needed for ER retention but do contain the necessary determinants for targeting to the vacuole.",
