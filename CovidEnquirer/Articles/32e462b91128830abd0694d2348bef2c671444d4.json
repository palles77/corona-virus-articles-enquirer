Membranelike complexes were observed forming within the remnants of the nucleolus in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Differences in cell polarity relative to the sites of virus entry assembly and budding as well as differences in the temporal aspects of replication were observed between midgut, fat body, and epidermal cells. The progressive spread of virus throughout larval tissues was studied at 24, 32, 48, 56, and 72 hr postinfection. The basal lamina seemed to be an effective barrier for the release of budded progeny virus into the hemocoel and large numbers of budded virus were produced. \"1 1987 Academic PKSS. IRK.",

This granulosis virus is polytrophic, infecting many of the tissues of the codling moth, and is highly pathogenic. Because the codling moth is an economically important pest, widespread interest in the use of this virus as a biological insecticide has developed. Not only have there been extensive field application tests (Falcon et al., 1968; Htiber and Dickler, 1975; Jaques et al., 1977) but considerable work has been done on the physical characterization of the codling moth granulosis virus (Croizier and Meynadier, 1973; Roberto, 1980; Harvey and Volkman, 1983) .",

Viral entry into the nucleus was not observed, although nucleocapsids were observed in nuclei where clearing had not occurred. In these cases it was impossible to determine whether these nucleocapsids represented invading virions or viral progeny. The site of entry of granulosis virus into the nucleus has been suggested by electron microscope studies to be through extranuclear uncoating at the nucleopores (Summers, 197 1; Granados, 1980) . Walker et al. (1982) observed intranuclear nucleocapsidlike structures associated with the nucleopores I day posttreatment that are similar to those observed in this study in that the exact origin cannot be determined. Occasionally nucleocapsids were observed associated with the pores on remnants of the nuclear envelope. This association, seen late in infection, suggested some preferential alignment of nucleocapsids with nucleopores. Whether these nucleocapsids represent invasive virus stuck on the outside of a nucleopore early in infection and unable to uncoat cannot be determined. They could also represent nucleocapsids which associated with the nucleopores within the nucleus prior to fragmentation of the nuclear envelope or nucleocapsids formed much later in infection which then encountered the remnants of the nuclear membrane.",

In some granulosis infections, a decrease in RER has been reported. Indeed, a reduction was noted in most cells other than in the midgut in this study as infection progressed. These RER whorls were most obvious in the midgut cells in which an excess of budded virus was produced over a long period. They persisted throughout the infection. Since envelope glycoproteins of budded virus are probably synthesized in the RER very early in infection, probably before and during the appearance of the first nucleocapsids, the importance of the RER in granulosis virus replication cannot be overlooked. Envelope proteins are probably inserted at the thickened specialized regions of the plasma membrane through which baculoviruses bud (Volkman et al., 1984) . Midgut cells which produced budded virus throughout the course of infection, in contrast to fat body and epidermis, would be expected to maintain RER longer in infected cells. An abundance of RER has also been noted in, for example, the midgut infection of Trichoplusia ni (Tanada and Leutenegger, 1970) .",

Later in infection the formation of membranelike complexes was associated with the nucleolus remnants. Wtiger and Benz (1971) described pseudonucleoli associated with CMGV infection. These small pyroninophilic bodies stain at approximately the same time that the membranelike complexes are seen to form within the residual nucleoli with the electron microscope.

It is within this component that RNA transcripts are normally believed to be located. The granular component of the nucleolus, containing the most mature of the ribosomal precursor particles, was also closely associated with the forming membranelike complexes. The nature of the membranelike complexes has yet to be resolved. They were similar in structure to the paired cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum that were also observed. It was seen that the cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum contained membranelike profiles in their lumen which were apparently continuous with fragments of the nuclear envelope. Similarly, MC which had ribosomes on their membranes were also seen to be continuous with pieces of the nuclear envelope. Membranelike complexes certainly seem to occur quite frequently in granulosis virus infections. In an electron microscope study of CMGV infections, Tanada and Leutenegger (1968) referred to them as coiled membranous structures surrounded by electron-dense material. They suggested that they might represent nuclear fragments. In the potato tuberworm, Phthorimaea operculella, the MC were called remnants of the nuclear membrane which appeared in myelinlike whorls (Hunter et al., 1975) . In Archips argyrospila the equivalent structures were considered stacks of annulate lamellae (Pinnock and Hess, 1978) . Walker et al.

In MHV-A59 infections the viral structural glycoproteins E, and E, were shown to be present in the membranes of the paired RER cisternae. It was suggested that the pairing resulted from an alteration of the normal budding mechanism in which the E, molecules projecting from the faces of two adjacent cisternae associate with the same viral nucleocapsid in the cytosol thereby causing pairing to occur. The surfaces of the RER cisternae were not strictly polarized and pairing could occur on either surface resulting in stacks, although three cisternae laminated together were seen only rarely.

In the midgut, the primary invasive virus is known to enter at the microvilli via fusion at the plasma membrane. Budding of progeny, secondarily invasive, virus was observed to occur in the basallateral and basal regions of the cells. Most of the budding appeared to occur into the intercellular spaces where cellular junctions were absent. Passage of the virus across the apical regions of the plasma membrane was not observed. In the fat body and hypodermis the initial site of infection was not observed. Entry into these and other tissues by the budded virus in the hemocoel is probably predominately by viropexis (receptor-mediated endocytosis) and to a lesser extent by fusion as seen by others (Tanada et al., 1984; Adams et al., 1977) . With the epidermis, only the basal regions of the cell are exposed to the hemocoel and it would appear that this would be the site of virus entry. Release of the virus was only observed along the basal regions of the epidermal cells. Accumulation of large amount of virus between the basal plasma membrane and the basal lamina was observed to be associated with a disruption of the hemidesmosomes which attach the basal lamina to the cell. The epidermal cells appeared to have junctions along the entire lateral plasma membrane and no virus was observed in the intercellular space until late in infection when the intercellular junctions were disrupted. Budded virus was never seen in the apical portion of the cell beneath the cuticle. In the case of the fat body, virus could potentially enter from any surface open to the hemocoel. Virus was observed to bud from any surface of the fat body cells. The preferential point of budding appeared to be those areas of the plasma membrane open to the hemocoel; however, virus was observed to also exit into intercellular spaces where junctions were not present. The nuclear polyhedrosis virus of Autographa california is known to insert a viral glycoprotein into the plasma membrane in vitro. The progeny virus buds through the altered membrane and acquires its envelope with associated viral glycoprotein (Volkman et al,, 1984) . In vivo budding of virus does not occur in regions of the cell membrane where specialized junctions occur and in the case of the epidermis and midgut does not occur from the apical regions of the cells. This would indicate that there may be distinct domains on the plasma membrane where viral glycoproteins may not or cannot be inserted and therefore through which budding cannot proceed. In the case of the epidermis and midgut nucleocapsid, movement during viral release was also predominately toward the basal regions where these glycoproteins were probably present.",

As infection progressed it was observed that there was a continuous production of budded virus from the midgut cells but in the epidermis and fat body budded virus was produced early in infection, accumulated beneath the basal lamina, and then gradually diminished until few were observed. How the virus passes through the basal lamina is unknown. The basal lamina forms a continuous layers over all the cells bordering the hemocoel except for hemocytes. At 24 hr postinfection, many virions were observed in the muscle and tracheal tissue basal to the midgut and virus replication was already evident in the fat body. However, very few micrographs were obtained of virions within the substance of the basal lamina and this was not until late in infection. In an NPV infection of tracheal cells the virus was observed to move laterally along the basal lamina to infect adjacent cell (Tanada et al., 1984) . The basal lamina is produced and secreted by the underlying cells. In the beginning of the fourth and fifth stadia and presumably at other times, it has been reported that the fat body phagocytoses its basal lamina (Locke, 1984) . The hemidesmosomes concentrate in an area that ultimately invaginates to become a phagocytic vacuole pulling with it the basal lamina. In Munduca ~exta the basal lamina of the epidermis is seen to thin on days 4, 8, 9 of the 5th larval instar (Sedlak and Gilbert, 1979) . Since codling moth larvae are most susceptible to virus infection during times that the basal lamina may be the thinnest (Etzel, 1973) it would appear to be a significant factor in virus spread.",

The midgut was seen to play a key role in the release of invasive progeny in that capsule production is delayed in this tissue, budded virus is produced over a long period of time, and the infection of adjacent midgut cells proceeds slowly. Even when larva were moribund cells were observed in the midgut in the early stages of infection. This is in contrast to the fat body where infection progressed quite rapidly and by 48 hr postinfection most cell were infected and had produced capsules. Degenerative fat body cells were easily observed and capsules found in the hemocoel all apparently originated from the fat body. Epidermal cells were slower to become infected than fat body cells. At 24 hr postinfection, some fat body cells were already producing nucleocapsids, but adjacent epidermal cells showed no signs of infection.",

The characteristic melting of the larvae apparently is caused by the degradation of the inner layers of the cuticle and the lysis of infected cells below. Some areas of the epidermis were afforded protection from infection by investing layers of uninfected muscle and trachea cells. Although subject to infection, many tracheal cells were also observed not to be infected after 72 hr. Residual cells were seen in all tissues that appeared resistant to infection. These cells may be portions of the cell population in which cell death has already been programmed so that the virus could not switch on the appropriate mechanisms for either invasion or replication. Interestingly, it was observed that these cells had virus adhering to the exterior of their plasma membrane possibly indicating that virus may not have been able to invade these cells after attachment.",

The fat body in many insects is a uniform tissue with only one cell type, the trophocyte. This cell is primarily concerned with the synthesis and secretion of proteins, lipid and glycogen metabolism, and the storage and breakdown of these products. In contrast, the midgut contains a diverse cell population of which columnar cells appear the most susceptible to infection. Even within the columnar cell population, however, a great diversity in functions occurs and this appears to be reflected in the time spread it took for individual cells to eventually begin producing virus.",
