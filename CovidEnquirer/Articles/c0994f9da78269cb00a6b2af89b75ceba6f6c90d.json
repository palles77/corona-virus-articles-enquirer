Here, we describe the isolation, evolution, and structure of a broad-spectrum human monoclonal antibody (mAb), MEDI8852, effectively reacting with all influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes. MEDI8852 uses the heavy-chain VH6-1 gene and has higher potency and breadth when compared to other anti-stem antibodies. MEDI8852 is effective in mice and ferrets with a therapeutic window superior to that of oseltamivir. Crystallographic analysis of Fab alone or in complex with H5 or H7 HA proteins reveals that MEDI8852 binds through a coordinated movement of CDRs to a highly conserved epitope encompassing a hydrophobic groove in the fusion domain and a large portion of the fusion peptide, distinguishing it from other structurally characterized cross-reactive antibodies. The unprecedented breadth and potency of neutralization by MEDI8852 support its development as immunotherapy for influenza virus-infected humans.",

However, influenza A infections account for the majority of hospitalizations and are the only type to cause pandemics (Wright et al., 2007) . Influenza A is subtyped by its two major surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is the main target of neutralizing antibodies that are induced by infection or vaccination. The globular HA head domain mediates binding to the sialic acid receptor, while the HA stem mediates the subsequent fusion between the viral and cellular membranes that is triggered in endosomes by the low pH (Skehel and Wiley, 2000) . Genetically, there are 16 influenza A subtypes of HA, which form two structurally and antigenically distinct groups (Nobusawa et al., 1991; Russell et al., 2004) . In addition, two new HA analogs recovered from bats, H17 and H18, have been included in this classification (Tong et al., 2012 (Tong et al., , 2013 . Currently, H1 and H3 HA subtypes are associated with human disease and viruses containing H5, H7, H9, and H10 HAs are associated with sporadic human infections due to direct transmission from avian species.",

Anti-stem antibodies are less potent at direct viral neutralization as compared to antihead antibodies, but were shown to induce potent antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of infected cells in vitro and in vivo (Corti et al., 2011; Dilillo et al., 2016; DiLillo et al., 2014) , while anti-head antibodies were not or less effective at mediating ADCC. In general, the human antibody response to the HA stem region is more frequent against group 1 as compared to group 2 HAs and is dominated by VH1-69 antibodies Sui et al., 2009; Wrammert et al., 2011) . Although subdominant, the group 1 stem response was shown to be recalled after heterologous boosts by the new pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009 (Corti et al., 2011; Wrammert et al., 2011) . The antibody response to the HA stem region of group 2 HAs is less frequent, possibly due to the presence of a conserved glycan bound to N38 in HA1 that may shield the access to the most conserved sites in the HA stem and to the lack of exposure to heterologous group 2 viruses (i.e., H7) or to new pandemic H3N2 viruses. Finally, antibodies capable of reacting with the HA stem region of both group 1 and 2 subtypes are extremely rare and usually do not show complete coverage of all subtypes. It has been hypothesized that such broadly cross-reactive antibodies might have potential as therapeutic agents and studies on their mechanism of action, epitope specificity, and ontogeny could also inform the design of cross-protective influenza virus vaccines (Corti and Lanzavecchia, 2013; Yewdell, 2013) .",

In view of the limitations of group 1 and group 2 antibodies isolated so far, we searched for an antibody capable of potently neutralizing group 1 and 2 influenza A viruses within a narrow range of antibody concentrations. In this study, we isolated and optimized an antibody, named MEDI8852, that exhibited unprecedented breadth and potency, being able to neutralize a diverse panel of representative viruses spanning >80 years of antigenic evolution. Unlike other broadly neutralizing stem-reactive antibodies, MEDI8852 is unique in that it uses a rare VH (VH6-1) and carries a low level of somatic mutations. Crystallographic analysis of the Fab alone or in complex with H5 and H7 HA proteins reveals that MEDI8852 binds a highly conserved epitope on H5 and H7 that is markedly different from other structurally characterized stem-reactive neutralizing antibodies. The characterization of this unique epitope and the breadth and potency of neutralization exhibited by MEDI8852 support its development for immunotherapy in influenza virus-infected humans.",

These antibodies (FY1, FY5, FY6, and FY18) belong to the same lineage carrying VH6-1*01/D3-3*01/ JH3*02 and VK1-39*01/JK1*01 gene segments ( Figure 1A) . We reconstructed the genealogical trees of this lineage and produced the unmutated common ancestor (UCA), the four clonally derived antibodies, and three antibodies representing the evolutionary branching points (BP) of the lineage ( Figure 1B ). Purified antibodies were tested for neutralizing activity against multiple viruses of different group 1 and 2 subtypes ( Figure 1C ). Interestingly, the UCA antibody exhibited neutralizing activity against group 1 viruses, but not group 2 viruses, albeit with lower potency as compared to some of the mutated antibodies. Of note, the first BP (BP1) gained neutralization activity toward early group 2 H3N2 viruses (HK/68 and VC/75). Two antibodies (i.e., FY1 and FY5) of this lineage acquired neutralization activity against group 2 viruses through two independent pathways of somatic mutations. The same analysis was extended to the lineage of FI6, a previously described antibody cross-neutralizing group 1 and group 2 viruses (Corti et al., 2011) . Isolation of five additional antibodies from this lineage allowed the reconstruction of a complex genealogy tree ( Figure S1 ). Similarly to what was observed for the FY1 lineage, the FI6-UCA antibody exhibited neutralizing activity against group 1 viruses only and evolved through two independent pathways of somatic mutations that led to the group 1-specific FI370 and FI6038 antibodies and to the group 1 and 2 cross-reactive antibodies FI6, FI2013 and FI4013. Taken together, these findings suggest that in both lineages, the UCA was initially selected by a group 1 virus and developed to a branching point characterized by crossreactivity toward a limited number of group 2 viruses. From this point, the final antibody may have been selected further for binding to group 1 only (e.g., FY6 and FI370) or group 2 HAs (e.g., FY1 and FI6). These results are consistent with a model in which the development of cross-reactive group 1 and 2 antibodies is started by group 1 HAs and then further selected through boosts by group 2 HAs.",

In addition, we have shown that MEDI8852 mediates the lysis of infected cells by human primary NK cells (ADCC), the antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) of MDCK cells expressing H1 or H3 HAs by human monocyte-derived macrophages and the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) of influenza-infected MDCK cells in the presence of complement ( Figures 3D, 3E , 3F, and S2).",

In these studies, ferrets were infected intranasally with 1 LD 90 of VT/2004 and then treated with a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 25 mg/kg of MEDI8852 at 1, 2, or 3 days post infection. We also used as a comparator, the anti-influenza drug oseltamivir at 25 mg/kg twice a day (b.i.d.) ( Figure 4G ). As expected, all control animals showed signs of infection including fever peaking from days 1-3 post infection and 100% mortality by day 7 post infection (Figures 4G and 4H) . In comparison, ferrets treated with MEDI8852 or oseltamivir on day 1 post infection were completely protected. When treatment was delayed until 2 or 3 days post infection, MEDI8852 provided complete protection with 100% survival while oseltamivir only partially protected animals with survival rates of 71% and 29%, respectively. In addition, MEDI8852 treatment resulted in a period of fever reduction following administration, which was not observed in oseltamivir or control antibody-treated animals ( Figure 4H ). Similar efficacy and therapeutic window results were seen when MEDI8852 and oseltami-vir treatments were compared in a lethal murine model ( Figures  S3B and S3C ).",

The structures of the HA proteins in both complexes are similar to those of the apo structures determined before (Russell et al., 2004; Xiong et al., 2015) . MEDI8852 makes similar contacts with both H5 and H7 HAs, by binding in a very similar orientation to both HAs ( Figures 5B-5D ), each Fab interacting with just one protomer of the HA trimer. Overall, the interactions bury 1,750 and 1,646 \u00c5 2 from solvent for the H5 and H7 complexes, respectively, consistent with their high binding affinity (Table S2) . MEDI8852 contacts the fusion domain of HA and interacts with three regions of HA2, a central hydrophobic groove, the fusion peptide and helix A, and with specific residues in the HA1 component of the fusion domain ( Figure 6 ). The location of MEDI8852 in the complex with the HA proteins is consistent with the in vitro assays showing that MEDI8852 stabilized the pre-fusion conformation inhibiting fusion as well as blocking the proteolytic cleavage of the HA precursor on the neighboring subunit ( Figure 3 ).",

We can, therefore, have confidence in our description of the inter-molecular contacts: hydrogen bonds described in the text should be regarded as potential interactions, however, given the limitations of defining the exact geometry of these interactions. The principal contact areas involve three CDRs, CDRH3, CDRH2, and CDRL1, with minor interactions with CDRH1 and CDRL3 ( Figure 6A ). CDRH3 makes extensive contacts with the bottom of a hydrophobic groove between helix A of HA2 and the fusion domain component of HA1 ( Figures 6B  and 6C ). Phe100A (CDRH3) inserts into this groove made by HA2 residues Ile45, Val48, Thr49, and Val52 of helix A, Trp21 of the fusion peptide, and Thr309 of HA1. Val100C (CDRH3) binds in a lower position in the same groove and interacts with the main chain of HA2 residues 19-21 of the fusion peptide as well as with the side chains of Trp21 and of HA1 His8 ( Figure 6B ). Asn100D (CDRH3) also makes hydrophobic contact with Val18 in Figure S3 and Table S3. the fusion peptide ( Figure 6C ). The CDRH2 loop interacts, through VH germline-encoded residues, with HA2 residues 15-19 of the fusion peptide ( Figure 6C ). In particular, HA2 Val18 is almost completely protected from solvent by Tyr56 (CDRH2) and Arg52B (CDRH2) . There is also van der Waals interaction between the Ca of HA2 Gly16 and Tyr52 (CDRH2) . Tyr52 (CDRH2) is positioned within hydrogen bonding distance of Gly16. Arg50 (CDRH2) forms a salt bridge with HA2 Asp19. Arg50 (CDRH2) also contributes to a polar patch on the antibody surface that includes Arg96 (CDRL3) and Asp58 (CDRH2) and Asp100F (CDRH3) . Finally, CDRL1 interacts with the N-terminal region of helix A of HA2 ( Figure 6D ). Ser30 (CDRL1) and Ser31 (CDRL1) are in hydrogen bonding distance of HA2 Gln42, while Tyr32 (CDRL1) and Leu29 (CDRL1) make hydrophobic contacts with the aliphatic moiety of HA2 Lys38 of helix A. The side chain of Tyr32 (CDRL1) stacks against HA2 Gln42 of helix A and its hydroxyl group is in hydrogen bonding distance of the main chain of HA2 Asp19 of the fusion peptide.",

            "text": "The epitope recognized by MEDI8852 is highly conserved between both HA proteins, consistent with the antibody's broad activity against group 1 and group 2 influenza viruses ( Figures  5C, 5D , and S5). However, the membrane proximal fusion domains of both group 1 and group 2 HAs have a few distinct structural differences such as glycosylation status of HA1 position 38, which could potentially affect the binding of some antibodies (Corti et al., 2011; Ekiert et al., 2009; Sui et al., 2009 ). In the H7 complex with MEDI8852, the bulky carbohydrate chain attached to HA1 Asn38 changes its orientation to allow antibody binding, as observed before in the FI6 Fab-H3 HA complex (Corti et al., 2011) . Another notable feature of the MEDI8852 complex with H7 HA is the involvement of HA2 Tyr38 in an aromatic stacking interaction with Tyr32 (CDRL1) . Interestingly, the tyrosine at position 38 is not conserved across all HA subtypes only in H7, H10, and H15. The arginine in H6, H9, H11, and H12 could engage in a similar stacking interaction although the leucine, lysine, and glutamine found in the remaining HA proteins could not interact in the same way. Thus, the high and similar affinities with which MEDI8852 reacts with these HAs, suggests that the differences in glycosylation at HA1 38 and the side chain at HA2 38 make a minor contribution to the overall energetics of binding ( Figure 2B ; Table S2 ).",

The loop formed by residues 97-100F of CDRH3 undergoes a largely rigid-body rotation, pivoted around Gly96 (CDRH3) and Ala100G (CDRH3) ( Figure 7A ) to facilitate interactions with HA. As a consequence, the side chain of Phe100A (CDRH3) moves by 5 \u00c5 , to insert into the hydrophobic groove of the epitope, near HA2 48. In addition, residues 27-32 (CDRL1) are restructured, with an average displacement of 10 \u00c5 between apo and bound forms.

A structural comparison of HA-bound MEDI8852 overlapped with the antibodies CR8020 and CR9114 is shown in Figures S7A and S7B , which reveals that the overall orientation of MEDI8852 is such that it sits slightly higher on the HA than the CR8020 antibody and lower than CR9114.

Both antibodies contain the four amino acid sequence ValPheGlyVal/Ile in their otherwise dissimilar CDRH3 loops. These tetrapeptides superpose in the complexes with an allatom root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.7 \u00c5 , indicating that they interact with their cognate HAs in a similar way (Figure 7C ). However, other contacts made by these antibodies with HA are quite different between MEDI8852 and 39.29, reflecting the fact that the two antibodies are not particularly similar in sequence and are derived from different germline sequences (VH6-1*01 and VK 1-39*01 for MEDI8852 versus VH3-30*01 and VK3-15*01 for 39.29). MEDI8852 contacts the base of helix A and the fusion peptide with its CDRL1 and CDRH2 loops, respectively ( Figure 6 ). By contrast, contacts made by the heavy chain of 39.29 Fab mainly involve CDRH3. 39.29 appears to bury helix A using all three light chain CDR loops. As a consequence, the 39.29-HA interaction buries a total of 2,287 \u00c5 2 , while MEDI8852 achieves similar affinity with a smaller buried surface of 1,646 \u00c5 2 .",

The first was FI6v3, which, although it recognizes both group 1 and group 2 HAs, has higher in vivo neutralizing activity against group 1 viruses (Corti et al., 2011) . The cross-group binding of FI6v3 has been attributed to its long and flexible HCDR3, which can accommodate the differences in conformation and environment of HA2 Trp21 observed between group 1 and group 2 viruses. There is a much more significant rearrangement between FI6v3 bound to H1 HA (group 1) versus H3 HA (group 2) than there is between MEDI8852 in its complexes with H5 HA (group 1) and H7 HA (group 2) which overlap very closely (Figures 5B and S7C) . MEDI8852, therefore, binds in a very similar way to HAs of both groups. This greater structural conservation of the binding interface is likely responsible for its broader neutralizing ability.",

The potential of broadly infectivity-neutralizing antibodies used therapeutically to address this need has provided a stimulus for their isolation and characterization. Among the antibodies considered to date, the anti-HA human monoclonal antibody MEDI8852 has demonstrated significant breadth of its infectivity-neutralizing capacity. MEDI8852 reacts with HAs of all influenza antigenic subtypes, potently neutralizes diverse virus strains with numerous HA subtypes, and can block infection and lethality caused by influenza viruses when administered up to 4 days after challenge with the virus in mice and up to 3 days post challenge in ferrets with the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. This potential ability to overcome the unpredictable characteristics of influenza, namely the antigenic shift, that results in disease during pandemic periods, and the antigenic drift, that occurs with the emergence of antigenically novel viruses, is a major advantage for a candidate anti-influenza therapeutic antibody.",

Binding of the antibody to HAs on the infecting virus inhibits HA-mediated membrane fusion that is required for the initiation of infection. At the end of infection, antibody binding to precursor HA0 can block its cleavage and prevent the formation and spread of newly made infectious virus. Additionally, binding of MEDI8852 to HAs displayed on the surfaces of infected cells results in their recognition and lysis by other components of the immune system: NK cells, macrophages, and complement. These multiple mechanisms exhibited by MEDI8852 presumably combine to ensure the observed effectiveness of antibody treatments in infected mice and ferrets.",

However, the regions of HA that interact with MEDI8852 are a combination of those previously assigned to group 1 specificity (primarily a hydrophobic groove and the adjacent helix A of HA) (Ekiert et al., 2009; Sui et al., 2009) or group 2 specificity (a separate part of the fusion peptide, near its N terminus) (Ekiert et al., 2011; Friesen et al., 2014) . The structural characterization of MEDI8852 bound and unbound structures also highlight the coordinated movement of the CDRH3 and the CDRL1 to insert into the hydrophobic grove of the HA, as well as the rearrangement of the orientation of the glycan attached to Asn38 of the H7 virus to allow antibody binding.

Indeed, the MEDI8852 donor was born in the 1950s and it is possible that this lineage was primed by H2N2 and further matured through multiple H3N2 exposures. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the observation that the UCA mAb neutralized with high potency the strain H2N2 JP/57 (i.e., IC 50 = 0.6 mg/ml). The UCA and mutated antibodies of the MEDI8852 and FI6 lineages represent useful tools to design stem-based immunogens that can be used in a heterologous prime-boost mode to prime the group 1 reactive naive B cells and selectively expand those that also cross-react with group 2 HAs.",

Heavy chain: Y32 (MEDI8852) instead of N32 (parental): The Y32 sidechain is within hydrogen bonding distance with HA and makes a stabilizing p stacking interaction with R52B, which is in direct contact with V18 in the fusion peptide of HA. G54 (MEDI8852) instead of K54 (parental): This amino acid is located in the middle of the CDRH2 loop in an unusual turn between the two beta strands of CDRH2. The backbone at G54 adopts a conformation that is only possible with a glycine sidechain. The parental K54 would lead to a different backbone conformation. Light chain: T33 (MEDI8852) instead of L33 (parental): This residue is next to CDRL1 and especially Y32, which undergo a conformational change upon binding. The T33 sidechain stacks against the sidechain of F71 in unbound and bound conformations, anchoring the entire CDRL1 region during the conformational change. The leucine in the parental antibody could make a similar stacking interaction, but would anchor CDRL1 in a different conformation due to the additional methyl group of the leucine. R54 and G55 instead of L54 and Q55 (parental): R54 and G55 are in CDRL2 and connected with CDRL1 through backbone hydrogen bonds. The sidechain of Q55 in the parental antibody would sterically clash with L46 and completely alter the backbone and sidechain conformation the LCDR1 and LCDR2 loops. G55 has no sidechain and thus does not clash. Therefore, R54 and G55 enable and stablilize the backbone conformation observed in the complex, which might form a stable platform for the conformational change in CDRL1 necessary for binding.",

Comparison between MEDI8852, CR8020, CR9114, and FI6, Related to Figure 7 (A and B) Antibody-HA complex structures were overlayed by aligning their HA2 polypeptides. For clarity, only the HA of the MEDI8852/H5 complex is shown. All proteins are shown in cartoon representation, with HA1 colored blue, HA2 colored red and the fusion peptide colored yellow. The CR8020 (A) and CR9114 (B) Fab fragments are colored light and dark gray, respectively, and the MEDI8852 Fab fragment is colored orange (heavy chain) and green (light chain). (C and D) The antibodies are shown in cartoon representation with group 1 bound antibody colored in magenta and group 2 colored in cyan from the N terminus of the heavy chain to the C terminus of the light chain. Helix A and helix B of HA2 are shown in cartoon representation. FI6v3 is rotated between group 1 and group 2 leading to a 11-13.5 \u00c5 distance between the ends of the variable domains. By contrast, for MEDI8852, there is a much smaller rotation of about 1 degree and only 2-1.5 \u00c5 displacement between the ends of the variable domains in the complexes with H5 HA (group 1) and H7 HA (group 2).",

Cold adapted (ca) live-attenuated influenza vaccine viruses were generated by either classical reassortment or by reverse genetics (Jin et al., 2003) . All viruses were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs, and virus titers were determined by mean 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per milliliter. Complete viral strain designations are shown in Table S1 . The microneutralization assay was performed as described previously . Briefly, 60 TCID50 of virus/well was added to three-fold serial dilutions of antibody in a 384-well plate in complete MEM medium containing 0.75ug/ml Trypsin (Worthington) in duplicate wells. After 1 hour incubation at 33\u00b0C 5% CO2, 2x10 4 MDCK cells/well were added to the plate. Plates were incubated at 33\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator for approximately 40 hr, and the NA activity was measured by adding a fluorescently-labeled substrate, methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl neuraminic acid (MU-NANA) (Sigma) to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Virus replication represented by NA activity was quantified by reading fluorescence using the following settings: excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm; 10 flashes per well. The concentration of antibody required for a 50% reduction in viral replication (IC 50 ) was calculated using a non-linear fit algorithm curve fit in Graph Pad Prism. If neutralization curve was not complete, then value was assigned the highest concentration of inhibitor tested.",

In brief, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (10 x 106 TCID50) propagated in the presence of trypsin was incubated with human red blood cells (2% final red cell concentration) on ice for 10 minutes. Antibody dilutions were incubated with virus for 30 minutes at room temperature. Red blood cells were added to the virus-antibody mixture for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C, then sodium acetate buffer (0.5 M pH 5.0) was added for additional 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged for 6 minutes at 400xg and incubated for additional 45 minutes at room temperature and then re-pelleted for 6 minutes at 400xg. Supernatants were transferred to an ELISA plate for determination of absorbance at 540 nm. To evaluate the ability of MEDI8852 to inhibit the low pH activated conformational change in HA, H5 HA (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 carrying substitution N186K) and H5-MEDI8852 Fab complex solutions (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated at various pH values (obtained by adding 0.15 M citrate buffer, pH 3.5), adjusted to neutral pH by using 1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and digested with TPCK treated trypsin at a ratio of 20:1 (wt:wt) for 30 min at 37 \u2070C. The digestion was stopped using an equal amount, to trypsin, of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Tryptic digestion products were analyzed by SDS/PAGE. To assess the ability of antibody to block the cleavage of HA protein, baculovirus expressed recombinant HA from A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) or A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) was incubated with antibody at molar ratio of 15:1 (mAb:HA) for 40 min. The antibody-HA mixture was then exposed to 2.5 \u00b5g/ml of TPCK-treated trypsin and further incubated for 5, 10, 20, and 40 minutes at 37\u00b0C.

Six-to eight-week-old BALB/c mice (Harlan Laboratories) were used in these studies. Mice were weighed on the day of or 1 day before virus challenge and monitored daily for 14 days for weight loss and survival (mice with body weight loss of \u226525% were euthanized). For the study of prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy, mice were infected intranasal with 3 x MLD50 of CA/2009 (9.5 x 10 4 TCID50/mouse); 5x MLD50 of WSN/33 (6 x 10 2 TCID50/mouse); 7 x MLD50 of rHK/68 (3.6 x 10 4 TCID50/mouse) on Day 0. Animals administered a single IP dose of 10 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, or 1 mg/kg of MEDI8852 on Day 0, Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, or Day 4 post-infection, depending on the virus strain. For oseltamivir comparison studies, mice were administered 25 mg/kg oseltamivir PO BID for 5 days, or a single dose of MEDI8852 10mg/kg IV with equivalent volume of vehicle given PO BID for 5 days to mimic the hydration of oseltamivir treated animals. To assess virus load in the lungs, four mice from each group were euthanized on Day 5 post-infection. Whole lungs were homogenized in 10% (wt/vol) sterile L15 medium (Invitrogen) and titrated on MDCK cells to determine the TCID 50 /gram of tissue. Lung function was measured using the MouseOx\u2122 Pulse-oximeter infrared sensor collar clip (Starr Life Sciences, Oakmont PA) to determine the percent blood SpO2 of mice on day 6 post infection. The ferret H5N1 study was completed under contract at Southern Research Institute (Birmingham, Alabama). Five-to-six months' old influenza sero-negative ferrets (Triple F Farms) were challenged intranasally with 1 LD90 of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in 1.0 ml (approximately 0.5 ml/nare). Infected animals were treated with either a single IV dose of MEDI8852 at 25 mg/kg, oseltamivir at 25 mg/kg BID for 5 days initiated at 1, 2, or 3 days post infection. Control-treated animals received a 25 mg/kg IV dose of isotype control monoclonal antibody on Day 1 post-infection. Bio-metric data systems chip was implanted between the shoulder blade for identification and temperature monitoring. Animals were monitored for weight loss, fever, clinical signs, and survival. isotype control mAb, R347 resulted in 13% survival for WSN/33 H1 and 0% survival for rHK/68 H3 infection b Log viral titer reduction was calculated by comparing to R347 treated animals with lung viral titers of 9.51 log 10 TCID 50 /g for WSN/33 H1 and 7.99 log 10 TCID 50 /g for rHK/68 H3 *p<0.05 using the Log Rank Mantel-Cox test for survival, and students t-test for lung viral titers of MEDI8852 treated animals verses R347 control treated animals ",

In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were obtained from a single healthy donor after vaccination following written consent. Memory B cells were isolated from cryopreserved or fresh PBMCs using CD22 microbeads or anti-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) after staining of PBMCs with CD22-FITC, and were immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CpG in multiple wells. Supernatants of immortalized B cell clones containing monoclonal antibodies were screened for binding to HA proteins representing two different HA subtypes. Using this methodology, we identified a monoclonal from primary screening in ELISA assay that showed crossreactive binding to recombinant HA proteins of A/Vietnam/2005 H5N1 and A/ Netherlands/2003 H7N7. Variable gene sequences were isolated from this cross-reactive clone by RT-PCR, cloned and expressed as a full-length IgG transiently in 293 T cells. The lead FY1 antibody was further modified to revert the non-germline framework amino acid changes and affinity optimize the CDRs. For the affinity optimization, full-length IgG constructs containing the different variants created by CDR based parsimonious mutagenesis were expressed transiently in 293 T cells and supernatants were screened by ELISA to select clones that resulted in increased binding activity to H3 while maintaining or increasing the binding activity to H1 HA proteins. Coating concentrations of 0.15 \u00b5g/ml of rabbit anti-human IgG were used to capture and normalize variant IgG constructs from supernatants, and binding was probed using 0.5 \u00b5g/ml of biotinylated HA proteins A/Perth/2009 H3N2 and A/California/7/2009 H1N1 followed by the addition of streptavidin-HRP (1:5000). Beneficial single mutations were combined and cloned into a combinatorial library, which were expressed and screened by ELISA as described above, leading to the generation of MEDI8852.",

The complex was then loaded onto a superdex-200 gel filtration column to purify the predicted 3Fab-HA complex from any excess Fab. Peak fractions corresponding to the Fab-HA complex were pooled and concentrated for crystallization. MEDI8855_H5 complex crystals were obtained from 16% PEG 3350, 0.1 M Pipes pH 7.0, cryoprotected with 25% ethylene glycol prior to freezing. MEDI8852_H7 complex crystals were obtained from 45% pentaerythritol propoxylate (PEP) 15/4, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5. MEDI8852 Fab crystals were obtained from 20% PEG 3350, 0.2 M Ammonium Dihydrogen Phosphate after seeding with crystals obtained from 18% PEG8000, 0.1 M Sodium Cacodylate pH 6.5 and 0.2 M Calcium Acetate Hydrate. Crystals were cryoprotected with 25% ethylene glycol prior to freezing.",

Diffraction datasets were indexed and integrated with XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and scaled with XSCALE. . For solving the MEDI8852 Fab fragment, a search model was generated by blasting the sequences of its heavy and light chains and using the structures with the highest sequence homology. The search models were generated in chainsaw from CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) . Molecular replacement was carried out with Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) , which found two constant domains and two variable domains corresponding to two Fab fragments. The structure was refined by rigid body and simulated annealing refinement in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010) , then completely rebuilt into the electron density, and then refined by alternating cycles of model building in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and TLS, restrained coordinate and B factor refinement in Refmac (Murshudov et al., 2011) . The complex structures were solved by molecular replacement using the cognate HA and MEDI8852 Fab structures as search models. For the H5 complex, Phaser found solutions for two HA trimers as well as for two variable domains of MEDI8852. Electron density was visible for the other 4 variable domains as well and atomic models were placed in the appropriate positions. After rigid body refinement in Phenix, electron density appeared for the constant domains, which were manually placed in the structure. There was clear difference density for HCDR3 and LCDR1 of MEDI8852 in the complex. To build the model of the complex, an unbiased omit map was calculated for each domain (HA1 fusion, HA1 esterase, HA1 head, HA2, MEDI8852 heavy chain variable, MEDI8852 heavy chain constant, MEDI8852 light chain variable, MEDI8852 light chain constant) in Phenix. Figures of merit were calculated for these Fourier maps using SigmaA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) and the maps were subjected to twofold and six fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging in DM. A sharpening B factor of 75 A 2 was applied to the structure factors before averaging. HCDR3 and LCDR1 were completely rebuilt into the averaged maps, and other residues were rebuilt according to the averaged maps as well as difference Fourier maps. The H7 structure was solved by molecular replacement in Phaser which found the one HA monomer as well as one variable and one constant domain of MEDI8852 in the asymmetric unit. The structure was refined by restrained coordinate refinement with global NCS restraints and TLS refinement in Refmac, and TLS and group B 6 factor refinement in Phenix with one TLS group per domain (see above). Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table S4 .",

For each HA subtype, after purging sequences that were identical or contained ambiguous nucleotide identities, the protein coding sequences were pairwise aligned with their respective HA subtype reference protein sequence. Sequences with different length than the reference were removed.

            "text": "Purified H1 and H3 HA proteins binding affinity to MEDI8852 Fab was measured using a ProteOn 3000 instrument. Briefly, anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody was amine-coupled to a GLC sensor chip with final anti-His-tag capture surface densities of ~2000 resonance units (RUs). Kinetic measurements were preformed by injecting a 100 nM solution of each HA protein, and then bound with three-fold serial dilutions of MEDI8852 Fab. Binding data for all concentrations of each HA protein, plus buffer alone, were collected, and dissociation data were collected for 30 min. Binding data was globally fit to a 1:1 binding model (ProteOn Manager software) that included a term to correct for mass transport-limited binding, should it be detected. This analysis determined the kinetic rate constants (k on , k off ), from which the apparent K D was then calculated as k off /k on . Purified H5 and H7 binding to immobilized MEDI8852 was measured on an Octet RED biolayer interferometer (Pall ForteBio Corp., Menlo Park, CA, USA) . Biotinylated anti-IgG-CH1 conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was first immobilized on streptavidin biosensors (Pall ForteBio Corp., Menlo Park, CA, USA) at a concentration of approximately 1 \u00b5g/ml in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% Tween-20. MEDI8852 Fabs were then bound to the anti-IgG-CH1 conjugate and the binding of HA (at 0.2 -200 nM) to the immobilized Fabs was measured at 25 o C in a 400 second association step. ",
