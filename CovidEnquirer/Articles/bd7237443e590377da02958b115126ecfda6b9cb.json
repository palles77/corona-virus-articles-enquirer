Otalgia may be associated with sensations such as a sense of fullness in the ear, burning, throbbing, tenderness or itching. The exact incidence of otalgia is not known. Adults tend to suffer from fewer ear problems and less otalgia than children. Children are mostly affected, since acute otitis media (which is the most common cause of otalgia) occurs mainly in young people (Murtagh 1991) .",

Based on the resultant findings, the disease is classified as primary or secondary (referred) otalgia (Tables 6.1, 6.2). Primary otalgia is due to a disease in the ear itself (a direct cause of earache) and the most serious problems are usually caused by infection. The areas most commonly involved in causing pain, or becoming infected, are the external ear and the middle ear. Pain in the external ear radiates most often to the vertex and to the temple, but may sometimes spread towards other areas of the head. Often patients cannot differentiate between pain originating in the inner ear and pain whose source is in the external or middle ear (Harvey 1992) .",

Branches of the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus cranial nerves all participate, as well as the lesser occipital and the great auricular cervical nerve roots.

Other affected structures may include the eye, the cardiovascular system, small and large peripheral joints and the middle and inner ear (Lucente et al 1995; Staats et al 2002; Gergely et al 2004) . The aetiology is unknown; however, the pathogenesis is most likely autoimmune (Gergely et al 2004) . Signs and symptoms of RP of the auricle include auricular cellulitis, typically with a sudden onset of unilateral or bilateral auricular pain, tenderness, swelling and redness, with sparing of the lobules. The pain and redness usually disappear within 2-4 weeks but may recur. A definitive diagnosis of RP is made by biopsy of the affected cartilaginous tissue that demonstrates infiltration of the cartilage and perichondrial tissues with neutrophils and lymphocytes and loss of cartilaginous matrix. Mild cases may respond to symptomatic treatment with aspirin, indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Severe cases are initially treated with systemic corticosteroids with tapering of the dose in accordance with the clinical response. In very severe cases addition of an immunosuppressive agent such as cyclophosphamide is required. Furuncle of the external ear canal is an acute, tender, perifollicular inflammatory nodule resulting from infection by S. aureus. The initial nodule evolves into a pustule with central necrosis, which later discharges a sanguineous purulent exudate. A furuncle causes localized pain within the external auditory meatus, which is intensified by local pressure. Treatment includes surgical drainage of the furuncle, systemic antibiotic therapy with oxacillin or cefazolin.",

Signs and symptoms of AOE include mild to severe otalgia associated with purulent discharge from the external ear canal. Auricular movement or pressure on the tragus intensifies the pain. The otalgia can become extreme as the canal swells and becomes blocked.

The disease spreads outside the external ear canal through the fissures of Santorini which are two slits located at the anterior cartilaginous external canal wall and the osseocartilaginous junction into the skull base. It is characterized by persistent severe otalgia, purulent otorrhea and granulation tissue in the external ear canal (Handzel and Halperin 2003) . Pre-auricular and temporomandibular joint pain intensified by opening the mouth or by chewing may be present. Severe headache in the temporal or occipital areas may accompany the earache. The severity of the pain can give a clue to the diagnosis. In severe cases, facial nerve involvement may occur, indicating an invasive infection. Other cranial nerve palsies, such as IX, X, XI and XII, may also occur. Imaging evaluation by computed tomography (CT) usually demonstrates soft tissue infiltration and bone destruction (Guy et al 1991) . Technetium 99 bone-scan is usually positive and is highly sensitive to NEO. Treatment includes good control of the diabetes and prolonged therapy with an anti-pseudomonal antibiotic such as ciprofloxacin for at least 6 weeks in addition to local therapy for the otitis externa.

Other cranial nerves may be involved and some degree of meningeal inflammation may occur (Ko et al 2000) . RHS is usually more painful than Bell's palsy. It is rare in healthy people and occurs Orofacial Pain and Headache more commonly in people with a weakened immune system, such as the elderly (Burke et al 1982) . Diagnosis of RHS is based on the clinical symptoms and signs. Prompt treatment with corticosteroids and antiviral medications such as acyclovir and famciclovir reduces the symptoms and improves recovery (Morrow 2000; Kinishi et al 2001) . Overall, chances of recovery are better if treatment is started within 3 days of the onset of symptoms. Certain degrees of hearing loss or facial paralysis may become permanent (Morrow 2000) . Recovery may be complicated if the nerve grows back to the wrong areas (synkinesis); this may cause inappropriate responses, such as tearing when laughing or chewing (crocodile's tears). Some may start blinking when talking or eating.",

AOM occurs most frequently in infants and children, particularly between the ages of 3 months and 3 years, although it can occur at any age. AOM usually follows or accompanies an upper respiratory infection (URI) or a reduced immune response with no special reason. AOM is the second most common childhood disease after URI. The first complaint is usually persistent, severe otalgia, which is often caused by an accumulation of fluid and pressure behind the tympanic membrane (TM). Other symptoms include hearing loss, fever, chills, irritability and a feeling of fullness and pressure in the affected ear. Spontaneous drainage of pus or a clear or bloody fluid from the middle ear is common, and may indicate perforation of the TM. An otoscopic examination reveals abnormal findings of the TM, including an erythematous and bulging TM, middle ear effusion, non-distinct anatomical middle ear landmarks, displaced or absent TM light reflex and decreased TM mobility on pneumatic otoscopy. The most common bacterial pathogen in AOM is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. These three organisms are responsible for more than 95% of all AOM cases with a bacterial aetiology. The most important factors in the pathogenesis of a middle ear infection are eustachian tube dysfunction and direct extension of infectious processes from the nasopharynx into the middle ear cleft. AOM is treated with painkillers and systemic antibiotics such as oral amoxicillin. Topical analgesics such as tetracaine applied by eardrops and nasal decongestants such as xylometazoline can be helpful. Antibiotic therapy relieves the symptoms, hastens resolution of the infection and reduces the chance for developing complications (such as mastoiditis or meningitis). Myringotomy (small incision of the TM) should be considered in cases of a bulging TM or a persistent earache.",

The disease is characterized by very painful vesicles on the tympanic membrane that may be full with a serous or haemorrhagic fluid. An upper respiratory tract infection can precede the ear manifestations. Pain is severe, starts suddenly, persists for 24-72 hours and is due to the TM blisters, which appear between the richly innervated outer epithelium and the middle fibrous layers of the TM (Woo et al 1992; Marais and Dale 1997) . Bullae involving the TM may also extend towards portions of the external auditory canal immediately adjacent to the TM. Objective cochlear and vestibular involvement manifested by sensorineural or mixed-type hearing loss and vertigo have been reported in patients suffering from MB (Eliashar et al 2004) . Treatment includes analgetic and antibiotic therapy such as azithromycin which is efficacious against the major known pathogens causing MB.",

The ET enables normal fluids to drain from the middle ear, and has an important role in equalizing the pressure in the middle ear when atmospheric pressure of ambient air shifts. Acute obstruction of the ET, mainly in cases of URI, may cause otalgia. This is especially common in small children, whose ET is naturally shorter and more horizontal. ET obstruction also occurs when there is an increase of postnasal drainage (PND) or allergy (Derebery and Berliner 1997; Grimmer and Poe 2005) . As the PND drains posteriorly into the nasopharynx around the opening of the ET, it gets irritated and swollen and eventually becomes blocked on one or both sides. When this happens, surrounding tissue absorbs the air in the affected tube, creating a vacuum, which causes the differences in pressure to pull the tympanic membrane inward, the result being a sensation of fullness and pain. Hearing can be slightly impaired and the ears can feel blocked or stuffed. To improve ET function, topical vasoconstrictors such as xylometazoline may be instilled into each nasal cavity.",

When a sudden increase in the ambient pressure occurs, air must move from the nasopharynx into the middle ear in order to maintain equilibrium on both sides of the TM. In cases of eustachian tube dysfunction, the pressure in the middle ear is below the ambient pressure, and the relative negative pressure in the middle ear results in retraction of the TM and transudation of blood from vessels. Very severe and sudden pressure differences may rupture the TM, causing bleeding in the middle ear with severe earache and conductive hearing loss. A perilymphatic fistula through the oval or round windows can occur, causing sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo. Barotrauma commonly occurs with altitude changes, such as in descent of an airplane, deep sea diving, scuba diving or driving in the mountains (Mirza and Richardson 2005) . Otalgia is the most common complaint of scuba divers and is experienced at some point by almost every diver (Clenney and Lassen 1996) . Some divers call it the 'ear squeeze'. A person with an acute URI or allergic rhinitis should be advised to abstain from diving. Topical application of a nasal vasoconstrictor such as xylometazoline before any activity associated with descent and pressure changes can prevent barotrauma.",

            "text": "Facial and sinus pain complaints are commonly encountered by physicians. Facial pain is usually referred to otolaryngology, dental, and neurologic clinics, and often needs a multidisciplinary evaluation. Facial pain is located in the area below the eyebrows or the supraorbital rims, extending along the course of one or more trigeminal dermatomes. Headaches are located in the forehead and temporal regions. Facial pain may be due to either local disease of any one of the major facial structures or a condition affecting their innervation. The latter can occur anywhere between the posterior cranial fossa and the distal ends of the trigeminal nerve. The prevalence of facial pain of paranasal sinus origin has probably been overestimated. Patients' expectations are often tempered by their own prior diagnosis of 'sinusitis' guided by their knowledge of the location of the sinuses, or by their primary-care physician. However, many of these patients are found to have no evidence of sinonasal disease and there is an increasing awareness among general physicians and otolaryngologists that neurological causes are responsible for most of the suffering experienced by patients with facial pain or headache. The 'gold standard' in establishing a sinonasal aetiology is a diagnosis made after a personal history, a careful physical examination, imaging studies, response to medical and surgical treatment and an extended follow-up period. Patients who undergo normal nasal endoscopy or CT scan are often found to suffer from a range of neurological causes (West and Jones 2001) . When the ostia of the sinuses are found to be patent and the mucosa healthy, the probability that a sinonasal disease or an anatomic variation is the cause of pain is eliminated (West and Jones 2001) .",

The ophthalmic (V1) and maxillary (V2) divisions of the trigeminal nerve provide sensation to the mucosa of the sinonasal cavity. These nerve branches terminate as extensive uncovered nerve terminal endings next to the basal cells of the nasal epithelium (Baraniuk 2001) . Nasal pain is mediated by Ad fibres-the fast-responding, primarily mechanoreceptive pain fibres-and by C fibresthe slower, unmyelinated fibres associated with a duller pain from mechanothermal and chemosensory stimulation (Baraniuk 2001) . Recent theories of sinonasal pain from 'contact points' or pressure from sinus inflammation are based upon substance P (SP) release from trigeminal sensory neurons located in the nasal mucosa (Stammberger and Wolf 1988; Chow 1994; Clerico 1995; Clerico et al 1997) . This may be accompanied by the release of various other neuropeptides such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which appear to be involved in the inflammatory cascade (Baraniuk 2001) . The local stimulation of the trigeminal fibres leads to both a painful orthodromic and an antidromic response, typified by vasodilatation and hypersecretion (Stammberger and Wolf 1988; Baraniuk 2001) . Despite this frequently cited mechanism for contact point sinonasal pain, it is poorly documented and highly controversial (Abu-Bakra and Jones 2001a,b; Jones 2004).",

However, these modalities may be very helpful in definitive diagnosis of rhinosinusitis. Patients with recurrent or complicated sinus disease may require imaging.

Human rhinovirus is the most common cause of viral ARS. Other viruses include coronavirus, influenza A and B virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Occasionally, a secondary bacterial infection of the paranasal sinuses occurs and requires specific antimicrobial therapy (Meltzer et al 2004) . Allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis, foreign body in the nasal cavity, trauma, dental Otolaryngological aspects of orofacial pain 6 infection and other factors leading to inflammation of the nose and paranasal sinuses can also predispose individuals to develop ARS. Commonly isolated bacteria in patients with ARS include S. pneumonia, non-typeable H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis (Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership 2004) . Streptococcus pneumonia and non-typeable H. influenzae account for more than 75% of bacterial isolates (Meltzer et al 2004) . Other streptococcal species, anaerobic bacteria and S. aureus are responsible for a small percentage of cases. Nosocomial rhinosinusitis often occurs in patients who require extended periods of intensive care, which involve prolonged nasotracheal intubation or a nasogastric tube. Isolates from hospitalized patients usually contain Gram-negative enterics such as P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and coagulase-negative S. aureus (Meltzer et al 2004) .",

The clinical diagnostic criteria for ARS as defined by the Task Force on Rhinosinusitis of the AAO-HNS include major and minor symptoms or signs, with a disease duration of less than 4 weeks (Table 6 .4). According to this classification, facial pain or pressure is regarded as a major symptom, whereas headache is considered to be a minor symptom (Lanza and Kennedy 1997; Meltzer et al 2004) . This classification was designed to be used by both primary care physicians and specialists. A diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is possible if two or more major symptoms or one major symptom and two or more minor symptoms are present. However, nasal purulence is a strong indicator of an accurate diagnosis. Facial pain or pressure alone does not constitute a suggestive history in the absence of another major nasal symptom or sign. Fever in itself does not constitute a strongly suggestive history in the absence of another major nasal symptom or sign. The IHS diagnostic criteria for sinusitis-related headache reiterate the requirement of clinical findings of acute sinusitis, along with a reversible 'sinus headache'; see Table 6 .5 (Olesen et al 2004) .",

Primary care and specialty physicians demonstrate variability in treatment approaches (Piccirillo et al 2001) . No benefit for antibiotic therapy has been demonstrated for the treatment of ARS diagnosed by clinical criteria alone (Stalman et al 1997) and one study showed no overall benefit for seven days of penicillin V compared to placebo (Hansen et al 2000) . However, there are indications that early antibiotics are of benefit for patients with the most severe maxillofacial pain symptoms at baseline (Williams et al 2003) . Success rates for amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole or erythromycin compared to newer, broader spectrum antibiotics are similar (Piccirillo et al 2001) . Therefore, current data do not support the use of newer, more expensive, non-penicillin antibiotics for first-line empiric therapy (Williams et al 2003) . Among the newer, wider-spectrum antibiotics efficacy was similar but amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more adverse effects than cephalosporins (Williams et al 2003) . Therefore, differences in adverse effects and costs should be considered when choosing a second-line antimicrobial therapy. Based on a meta-analysis, ARS should be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for 10 days (Williams et al 2003) . For penicillin-allergic patients, several cephalosporins and macrolides have been shown to be equivalent to amoxicillin (Williams et al 2003) . Based on limited data, there is no convincing evidence that adjuvant treatment such as topical nasal decongestants or nasal corticosteroids improve clinical outcomes.",

This condition is usually part of chronic pansinusitis which involves the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, the most common symptom being chronic purulent nasal discharge.

They also stated that mucosal contact points could result in the release of substance P, a recognized neuropeptide and transmitter in nociceptive fibres. Other authors have adopted this concept to explain how pain might be induced by anatomical variants such as a concha bullosa (a pneumatized middle turbinate) or a pneumatized superior turbinate touching the septum (Morgenstein and Krieger 1980; Blaugrund 1989; Goldsmith et al 1993; Clerico and Fieldman 1994; Clerico 1996) . According to the IHS, the assumptions related to certain otolaryngologic conditions often considered to induce headaches have not been sufficiently validated. These include deviation of the nasal septum, hypertrophy of turbinates and atrophy of sinus membranes. However, mucosal contact point pain is defined in the IHS appendix; see Table 6 .7 (Olesen et al 2004) .",

This term has recently been changed by the IHS to persistent idiopathic facial pain; see also Chapter 11. The pain fluctuates in intensity and severity. Occasionally, patients use terms such as 'sharp' or 'knifelike' to describe the pain. The pain often worsens at night, and can be aggravated by activity. Sometimes pain is continuous. In the majority of cases, only one side of the face is affected, but pain on both sides is also possible. The pain may move from one part of the face to another, and may be accompanied by complaints such as 'mucus moving' in the sinuses (Jones 2004) . Interestingly, the pain often crosses the recognized neurological dermatomes. AFP is more common in women over the age of 40. In some AFP cases the symptoms may initially appear similar to trigeminal neuralgia, but they progress towards an AFP pattern. Whereas trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by quick episodes of jabbing or lancinating pain, AFP attacks always last longer than a few seconds, usually minutes or hours (see Chapters 11 and 13). Moreover, no trigger points on the face are detected in AFP. Many patients suffering from AFP show a significant psychological disturbance or a history of depression, and are unable to function normally as a result of the pains (Jones 2004) . AFP usually has no specific cause. However, injury of any peripheral or proximal branch of the trigeminal nerve due to facial trauma or skull base fracture can produce this disorder. This possibility is extensively discussed in Chapter 13.",

The air within the sinus contracts and causes the walls of the sinus to bleed. This is accompanied by intense, sharp pain. Common causes of sinus barotraumas include allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, nasal deformity, nasal polyposis, acute URI and chronic irritation (such as smoking, diesel fumes, chemicals and prolonged use of decongestant nasal drops). Symptoms include pain in the area of the affected sinus or in the upper teeth (when the maxillary sinus is involved) and nose bleeding. The frontal sinuses are the most frequently affected, because the nasofrontal duct draining the frontal sinus is longer and more tortuous. A 'reverse squeeze' occurs during ascent, when air in the sinus expands without any ability to escape and is extremely painful. The situation is self-limiting, because air is gradually absorbed into the tissues lining the sinuses. When a sinus squeeze occurs, a slow ascent to the surface that generally alleviates most of the pain is recommended. Because the sinus Otolaryngological aspects of orofacial pain 6 may be filled with blood, the patient is at high risk of developing consequent sinusitis. Antibiotic therapy along with oral and nasal topical decongestants to promote drainage is recommended. Persistence of severe pain with no signs of acute rhinosinusitis may be treated by a short course of steroids. Diving is not recommended for patients with URI. Tension-type headache. Symptoms of a tension-type headache include headache and pain in the nape (see Chapter 7). Tension headaches may be caused by muscle strain due to anxiety and muscular rigidity. To prevent the development of muscle strain, and consequently a tension headache, divers must learn to adopt a proper posture and relax in the water.",

            "text": "The reason for the high rate of sinus headache patients misdiagnosed by their physicians is related to the pathophysiology of migraine and to the nature of nasal pain. The neurovascular theory of migraine implicates the nervous system as being the initiator of the process, and the blood vessel involvement occurring as a consequence of the neuronal process. This migraine model identifies the starting point in the central nervous system followed by a sensitization of the peripheral neurons of the trigeminal nerve, including those which supply sensation to the meninges. When the peripheral early phase is not treated in time, central sensitization at the level of the caudal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve occurs, with concomitant repetitive firing of the involved neurons, and pain in the distribution of the ophthalmic (V1) and/or maxillary branch (V2) of the trigeminal nerve. These nerves also provide sensation to the mucosa of the sinonasal cavity and are involved in the neurobiology of primary sinonasal pain. The early sensitization phase is accompanied by cutaneous allodynia (pain induced by stimulation which is normally non-painful) in the majority of patients (80%), and often occurs in the distribution of V1 and V2 (Cady and Schreiber 2004) . This may include stimulation of the nose, such as while breathing cold air. A migraine attack may include secondary nasal symptoms, which are probably mediated by stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system via the superior salivatory nucleus of the facial nerve (VII); this reflex activation is extensively discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. A report on patients with sinus headaches which fulfil the migraine criteria demonstrated that 84% reported sinus pressure, 82% sinus pain, 63% nasal congestion, 40% rhinorrhea, 38% watery eyes and 27% 'itchy' nose . Occasionally, sinonasal disease or nasal allergy can play a role in triggering migraine which may respond to nasal steroids or to leukotriene antagonists (Cady and Schreiber 2004) . The appearance of 'neurogenic rhinitis' along with a sinus headache in patients with migraine is often misunderstood and contributes to misdiagnosis.",

Mere reliance on clinical criteria, such as the presence of follicular exudate, erythema, fever and lymphadenopathy, is not an accurate means for distinguishing streptococcal from viral tonsillitis. Throat culture is the gold standard for detecting GABHS tonsillitis with a sensitivity of 80-95%. Rapid antigen detection test (RADT) detects the presence of GABHS cell wall carbohydrate from swabbed material and is considered less sensitive than throat cultures. However, RADT has a high specificity and produces results in significantly less time than a throat culture.",

Presenting symptoms include severe throat pain, especially on swallowing, fever, drooling, foul breath, trismus, hot potato voice and unilateral referred otalgia. Limited mouth opening (trismus) is always present in varying severity. The tonsil and uvula are displaced medially by the peritonsillar infection. The soft palate and the anterior pillar are swollen and hyperaemic. Unilateral enlarged and tender submandibular lymph nodes are present.

The styloid process divides the PPS into an anterior or prestyloid compartment and a neurovascular or poststyloid compartment. Parapharyngeal space infections (PPSI) may follow an infection in the pharynx, tonsils, adenoids, teeth, parotid gland, peritonsillar area, submandibular space, retropharyngeal space, Bezold abscess (mastoid abscess on the inner aspect of the mastoid tip along the digastric ridge) and adjacent lymph nodes. Despite the multitude of well-defined potential sources, in nearly half of the cases, the aetiology cannot be defined. Signs and symptoms of PPSI differ depending on whether the prestyloid or post-styloid compartment is involved. Anterior PPSI is characterized by pain in the angle of the jaw, preauricular area, ear and adjacent upper neck. Rotating the head and neck to the contralateral side intensifies the pain. Other symptoms include dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling, trismus (due to medial pterygoid muscle irritation), fever, chills and malaise. Oedema and medial displacement or bulging of the lateral pharyngeal wall and tonsil are hallmarks of PPSI. Swelling, induration and tenderness at the angle of the mandible are also commonly observed. Dyspnea and other symptoms of airway obstruction may occur in severe cases.",

RPSI may also occur directly after a traumatic perforation of the posterior pharyngeal wall or oesophagus, or indirectly, from the parapharyngeal space. Most RPSIs in children are secondary to URI, whereas trauma or foreign bodies cause most RPSIs in adults. Retropharyngeal lymph nodes tend to regress by the age of 5, causing infection in this area to be much more common in children than in adults. RPSI may drain into the prevertebral space and through this space into the chest, thus causing mediastinitis. Symptoms of RPSI include sore throat, dysphagia, stiff neck, fever and rarely posterior neck and shoulder pain aggravated by swallowing. Examination reveals anterior displacement or bulging of one or both sides of the posterior pharyngeal wall due to involvement of lymph nodes, which are distributed lateral to the midline fascial raphe. Lateral neck radiograph (demonstrating widening of the retropharyngeal space) and CT scan with contrast of the neck facilitate diagnosis and assessment of the extent of RPSI. Early diagnosis is important and treatment with aggressive intravenous antibiotics is mandatory. Transoral incision and drainage is recommended in cases with abscess formation.",
