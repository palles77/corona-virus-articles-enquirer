A docking study involving binding between the dipeptidic lead compound 4 and 3CL pro suggested the modification of a structurally flexible P3 N-(3methoxyphenyl)glycine with various rigid P3 moieties in 4. The modifications led to the identification of several potent derivatives, including 5cek and 5n with the inhibitory activities (K i or IC 50 ) in the submicromolar to nanomolar range. Compound 5h, in particular, displayed the most potent inhibitory activity, with a K i value of 0.006 mM. This potency was 65-fold higher than the potency of the lead compound 4 (K i \u00bc 0.39 mM). In addition, the K i value of 5h was in very good agreement with the binding affinity (16 nM) observed in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). A SAR study around the P3 group in the lead 4 led to the identification of a rigid indole-2-carbonyl unit as one of the best P3 moieties (5c). Further optimization showed that a methoxy substitution at the 4-position on the indole unit was highly favorable for enhancing the inhibitory potency.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a highly contagious and fatal respiratory disease that has infected more than 8000 individuals, 10% of which died within a few months of the emergence of the disease between November 2002 and early 2003 [1] . Extensive collaborative research cooperation between the leading experts and the World Health Organization (WHO) led to the rapid identification of a novel coronavirus (CoV) as the etiological agent underlying the pandemic SARS infection. The SARS outbreak was consequently successfully controlled during the beginning of 2003 [2, 3] . A reemergence of a SARS-CoV pandemic is still considered to be a potential risk, and new strains of SARS could potentially be more severe than the strains that contributed to the 2003 outbreak. Since 2003, two additional human coronavirus, NL63 and HKU1, have been identified in patients around the world. These new viruses have been characterized and were found to be significantly less lethal than SARS-CoV [4e6] . A new SARS-like virus, HCoV-EMC, was recently identified in at least two individuals, one of whom died [7] . The first case of a fatal respiratory illness similar to the deadly SARS was very recently confirmed in Britain [8] . The possibility of a future SARS-like pandemic remains, and no vaccines or antiviral agents have yet been developed to prevent or treat SARS-like infections.",

As shown in Fig. 1 , a first tripeptidic lead compound (1) bearing an electrophilic ketone as a warhead moiety was developed from the natural peptide sequence after extensive structural modifications [12] . Regarding the mechanism of action, the electrophilic ketone of 1 can be reacted to the active site Cys-SH group resulting in the formation of hemithioketal intermediate between the enzyme and inhibitors to interfere the enzyme function, and hence it was predicted be a reversible inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CL pro . A subsequent SAR study afforded promising inhibitors 2 and 3 with excellent inhibitory activities (K i ) of 4.1 and 3.1 nM, respectively [13] . Recently, we reported a series of low molecular weight dipeptide-type inhibitors in which the P3 valine moiety was removed form the lead compound 2 (see Fig. 1 ). This study led to the identification of a compound 4 as a promising lead with an inhibitory activity (K i ) of 0.39 mM (Fig. 2) [14] . From a structural point of view, the P3 N-arylglycyl moiety was recognized as crucial to the activity of 4, as the amine functionality of glycyl moiety formed a hydrogen bond with the backbone amino acid residue Glu166 of 3CL pro in the docking study.",

In this study, we envisioned that substitutions at the P3 N-arylglycyl unit in 4 could improve the inhibitory potency against 3CL pro . Therefore, we designed and synthesized a series of analogs bearing a rigid P3 motif for evaluation against SARS-CoV 3CL pro . In a first attempt as shown in Table 1 , the N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycyl unit was replaced with the DL-pyroglutamyl (5a; K i \u00bc 2.70 mM) or the pyrrole-2carbonyl (5b; K i \u00bc 1.70 mM) as a rigid P3 scaffold in 4. The inhibitory activities of the resulting compounds were dramatically reduced compared to the activity of 4 (K i \u00bc 0.39 mM). On the other hand, the introduction of an indole-2-carbonyl unit (5c; K i \u00bc 0.065 mM or IC 50 \u00bc 1.50 mM) yielded a 40-or 25-fold higher inhibitory potency relative to 5a or 5b, respectively, and a 6-fold more potent activity relative to 4.

Compound 5q, bearing a benzofuran unit, displayed a severely reduced inhibitory potency compared to the lead compound 5c. The observed low activity of 5q was attributed to the disruption of hydrogen bonding interactions at the P3 position. This result suggested that the hydrogen bonding properties of the amine moiety of the indole unit were very important for achieving effective inhibitory activities (see Fig. 4 ). The position of the carbonyl substitution on the indole unit in 5c was examined next. The inhibitory activity of the derivative (5r; K i \u00bc 0.683 mM) bearing an indole-3-carbonyl was reduced relative to the activity of the compound bearing an indole-2-carbonyl (5c;",

            "text": "The binding mode of the most potent compound, 5h was computationally modeled using a three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV 3CL pro based on the reported crystal structure [27] . A procedure similar to the procedure described previously was used here [12e14] . The molecular docking of 5h (orange sticks) was examined, in comparison with a lead compound 4 (blue sticks) and a structurally similar tripeptidic ligand (light blue sticks), the docking structure of which was elucidated by X-ray crystallography Fig. 3 ) [27] . Several minimization processes were performed using the MMFF94X force field to model the solvation environment surrounding the inhibitor. A molecular simulation was subsequently performed. As shown in Fig. 3 , the 5h moieties P1 0 eP2 interacted with the same region of the protease as did the lead compound 4 and the original ligand. The heterocycle unit mimicked the P3 valine of the reported substrate, and the phenyl ring in the indole unit partially occupied the S4-pocket. The rigid P3 moiety (4-methoxyindole unit) of 5h appeared to occupy a region of the active site with an appropriate volume and in a conformation that was more favorable than the conformation of the structurally flexible N-(3-methoxyphenyl)glycyl moiety in 4. Indeed, the fit of the rigid P3 moiety of 5h may have contributed to the 65-fold higher inhibitory potency of 5h as compared to 4. The detailed interactions between 5h and the active site are shown in Fig. 4A . Hydrogen bonds between the amine moiety (-NH) of the indole unit and the backbone amino acid residue Glu166 of 3CL pro were observed with a bond length of 2.673 A. Insight into the structureeactivity relationships was sought by performing docking studies and analyzing the binding interactions of certain compounds that displayed notable variations in their inhibitory activities (Fig. 4BeD) . The initial lead compound 5c, bearing a P3 indole-2-carbonyl unit, was docked (Fig. 4B) , revealing hydrogen bonding interactions similar to those predicted for 5h (Fig. 4A) ; however, 5q, bearing a benzofuran-2-carbonyl P3 moiety, could not form a hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone amino acid residue Glu166 (Fig. 4C) . The loss of hydrogen bond interactions could have reduced the inhibitory activity of compound 5q (K i \u00bc 14.1 mM) compared to the activity of compound 5c (K i \u00bc 0.065 mM). The compound 5r (K i \u00bc 0.683 mM), bearing an indole-3-carbonyl unit, engaged in two fewer hydrogen bonding interactions to the amino acid residues Glu166 and Gln189 of the protease relative to 5c, as shown in Fig. 4D . This study revealed that the optimal positioning of a carbonyl unit on the indole unit was very important for achieving a potent inhibitory activity.",

The heat associated with inhibitor binding was obtained by subtracting the heat of dilution from the heat of reaction.

Several minimization processes were performed using the MMFF94X force field to model the solvation environment surrounding the inhibitor. Structures having a relatively low binding free energy and a high number of cluster members were selected for the subsequent docking conformation optimization step. The minimized energies of 5h, obtained from the docking study, were \u00c041.49 and \u00c037.51 kcal/mol.

The concentration of protease in the syringe was 109 mM. The heat evolved upon each injection of protease was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The heat associated with inhibitor binding was obtained by subtracting the heat of dilution from the heat of reaction. The individual heats were plotted against the molar ratio, and the enthalpy change (DH) and association constant (K a \u00bc 1/K d ) were obtained by nonlinear regression of the data (see Fig. 4 ).",
