Given that X-rays penetrate through biological tissues, X-ray-induced scintillation would enable remote optogenetic control of neural functions at any depths in the brain. Here we show that a yellow-emitting inorganic scintillator, Ce-doped Gd3(Al,Ga)5O12 (Ce:GAGG), can effectively activate red-shifted excitatory and inhibitory opsins. Using these scintillator-opsin combinations, we successfully activated and inhibited midbrain dopamine neurons of freely moving mice by X-ray irradiation, producing bi-directional modulation of place preference behavior. The Ce:GAGG crystal was biocompatible and could be implanted for a long period without progressive neuroinflammatory responses. Neither brain injury nor behavioral dysfunction was acutely induced by radiation during the behavioral tests. Thus, X-ray-induced scintillation allows wireless control of cellular functions in living animals, expanding X-ray applications to functional studies of biology and medicine.",

DNA plasmids encoding different opsins were transfected into HEK 293 cells and photocurrents induced by PL illumination were measured (Fig. 1C) . For depolarizing opsins, the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG (1.8 mW/cm 2 ) elicited the largest photocurrents in cells expressing the red-shifted opsin bReaChES (13) (340.3 \u00b1 43.1 pA, n = 12; Fig. 1D ). Regarding inhibitory opsins, the anion channelrhodopsin GtACR1 (14) showed the strongest activation (627.2 \u00b1 80.2 pA, n = 12; Fig. 1E ) in response to the PL of Ce:GAGG (1.8 mW/cm 2 ). PL-irradiation of GFP-expressing cells induced undetectable currents (Fig. 1 , D and E). Thus, Ce:GAGG PL can activate red-shifted opsins that are used for optogenetic control of neurons. Furthermore, the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG could also induce significant activation of enzyme rhodopsin BeGC1 (15) (fig. S3 ), suggesting that the scintillation of Ce:GAGG can be used for activation of various light-sensitive proteins.",

Credependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors were injected into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of DAT-IRES-Cre mice to induce the specific expression of bReaChES in dopamine (DA) neurons ( Fig. 2A and fig. S4 ). In acute slice preparations, 1-s pulses of the yellow PL of Ce:GAGG elicited depolarizing photocurrents in DA neurons in a PL intensity-dependent manner ( Fig. 2B ) Irradiation with 13.5 \u00b5W/cm 2 elicited action potentials in a fraction (2 out of 6) of DA neurons, and the rate of PL-evoked spikes was plateaued at approximately 40 \u00b5W/cm 2 (Fig. 2 , C and D). With a higher PL intensity (2.0 mW/cm 2 ), time-locked spiking up to 20 Hz could be induced with shorter (2 ms) pulses ( fig. S5 ). In DA neurons expressing inhibitory soma-targeted GtACR1 (16) (stGtACR1; fig. S4 ), hyperpolarizing photocurrents were induced by Ce:GAGG PL illumination, which attenuated action potential generation at 13.5 \u00b5W/cm 2 and maximally suppressed spiking at >30 \u00b5W/cm 2 PL (Fig. 2, F and G) . Thus, the Ce:GAGG crystal combined with bReaChES and stGtACR1 can serve as bi-directional optogenetic actuators.",

The intensity of the RL emitted by the Ce:GAGG crystal was proportional to the intensity of X-rays (Fig. 3A ). X-ray irradiation for total 10 min (20 s pluses every 1 min, 30 times) induced c-Fos expression among bReaChES-expressing neurons only in the presence of Ce:GAGG crystals, but not under control conditions (Fig. 3 , B to D), suggesting that the RL of Ce:GAGG can activate bReaChES-expressing neurons. Before the scintillation-mediated optogenetics is adapted to living animals, the biocompatibility of the scintillator was assessed. The vast majority of dissociated hippocampal neurons around the Ce:GAGG crystal in the culture dish survived for 7 days (Fig. 3E) , and a fraction of neurites extended toward the crystal (Fig. 3E) . Similarly, HEK 293 cells cultured in the presence of the Ce:GAGG crystal proliferated at a normal rate ( fig. S6 ). Furthermore, rod-shaped Ce:GAGG crystals (size: 0.5 mm \u00d7 0.5 mm \u00d7 1.0\u22121.5 mm) implanted into the brain for four weeks did not cause activation of glial cells beyond that caused by biocompatible optic fibers ( Fig. 3F and fig. S7 ). Thus, the Ce:GAGG crystal is biocompatible and could be implanted without cytotoxicity.",

Transient activation and inhibition of DA neurons in the VTA is sufficient for behavioral conditioning (17) (18) (19) . We therefore induced the expression of excitatory bReaChES or inhibitory stGtACR1 in VTA-DA neurons through viral injections, and bilaterally implanted rodshaped Ce:GAGG crystals over the VTA (Fig. 4A) . The conditioned place preference (CPP) test was performed by placing the mice into a test chamber with two compartments, only one of which was irradiated by X-rays ( Fig. 4B and fig. S8 ). The initial place preference was not different among opsin-expressing and GFP-expressing control mice (Fig. 4C ). After two days of conditioning, however, mice expressing bReaChES had a significantly greater tendency to spend more time in the X-ray conditioned compartment (Fig. 4, D and E, and fig.  S9 ), whereas those expressing stGtACR1 spent significantly less time in the conditioned compartment (Fig. 4 , D and E). Control mice did not change place preference after conditioning (Fig.  4, D and E, and fig. S9 ). These opsin-expressing mice did not show any difference in the body weight, spontaneous locomotor and rearing behaviors compared to control mice ( fig. S10 ). Xirradiation of an implanted Ce:GAGG crystal did not affect the temperature of the ambient tissue ( fig.  S2 ).",

Thermal effects on neuronal activity were negligible using this technology, a significant advantage over conventional (22, 23) and NIR-mediated (9, 10) optogenetics. Given the deep tissue penetration of X-rays ( Fig.  1A) , scintillation-mediated optogenetics can be readily applied to larger animals including monkeys. Future innovations and technical advances, such as minimizing the size of the implanted scintillator crystals, or reducing the dose of X-rays through the use of pulsed and targeted X-ray irradiation, should further enable manipulation of neuronal functions with less invasiveness.",

Conditioned place preference (CPP) tests were performed in an X-ray machine (MX-160Labo, mediXtec Japan) at the dark period. On the first day of the tests, mice were placed in a test chamber with two compartments (each 10 cm \u00d7 12 cm) with different floor textures and visual cues on the walls (Fig. 4B) . The mice were habituated to the chamber for 5 min and then allowed to explore freely for 10 min without X-ray irradiation. On the second and third days, the mice were conditioned for 10 min in the chamber in the chamber in which only one of the compartments received X-ray irradiation (150 kV, 3 mA; fig. S8 ). To restrict the X-ray irradiation to one side, the other compartment was partially shielded with lead boards (Fig.  4B ). On the fourth day, the mice were placed in the chamber for 10 min without X-ray irradiation. In the unbiased CPP tests, the mice were videotaped at an oblique angle using a USB camera while the whole chamber was illuminated by ambient white LED light, and the ears of mice were tracked offline using DeepLabCut (30). For the biased CPP tests (fig. S9 ), a soft floor mat was placed in the non-X-irradiated compartment so that the mice could spend less time in the X-irradiated compartment. In the biased CPP tests, the mice were filmed under infrared (IR) light using an IR camera, and the total time spent in each compartment was measured based on the location of the mouse head. After completion of the CPP tests, the mice were perfused with 4% PFA and the brain was postfixed overnight. The brain was cut into coronal sections (section thickness: 80 \u00b5m) and the Ce:GAGG implantation sites were observed. The trace of the implanted crystal was observed at 0\u2212200 \u00b5m from the closest edge of labelled VTA. One mouse that showed considerable damage to the VTA caused by a ventrally-implanted crystal was excluded from the analysis.",
