Cholesterol disruption of macrophage membranes using four pharmacological agents acting by different mechanisms: methyl-\u03b2 cyclodextrin, nystatin, filipin complex and Lovastatin, all significantly inhibited productive HIV entry and reverse transcription. The inhibitory effects of these drugs resulted in decreased virus release from infected cells, and could be substantially reversed by the addition of water-soluble cholesterol. The virus bound equally to cholesterol-disrupted cells even though HIV receptor expression levels were significantly reduced. Macrophage CD4 and CCR5 were found to partition with the detergent-resistant membranes with a typical raft-associating protein flotillin-1. HIV particles were observed co-localising with a marker of lipid rafts (CTB-FITC) early post infection. These data suggest that macrophage membrane cholesterol is essential for HIV entry, and implicate lipid raft involvement.",

            "text": "Virus entry into target cells is a complex process involving many cellular and viral proteins with the primary goal of overcoming the barrier of the cellular membrane. Some viruses achieve this by acquiring a lipid envelope during exit from the host cell; these enveloped viruses enter cells by fusion of their envelope with the cellular membrane at either the cell surface or within an endosome. Viruses without a lipid envelope have acquired mechanisms to penetrate the membrane barrier, entering cells mainly via an endocytic pathway using either clathrin-coated vesicles or caveolae, or by the formation of a pore at the cell surface as has been proposed for poliovirus (Hogle, 2002; Marsh and Helenius, 2006; Smith and Helenius, 2004) . There is a growing amount of evidence that cholesterol, an important structural component that modulates the fluidity of biological membranes, is essential for the uptake of many viruses. Successful virus entry may require cholesterol in the host cell membrane or in the viral envelope. Many enveloped viruses, such as vaccinia virus (Chung et al., 2005) , herpes simplex virus (Bender et al., 2003) and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (Li et al., 2007) require cholesterol in the target cell membrane. The same is true for many non-enveloped viruses; SV40 (Anderson et al., 1996) , foot-and-mouse disease virus and echovirus (Marjomaki et al., 2002; Pietiainen et al., 2004) require cholesterol to enter cells by the lipid raft-dependent caveolae endocytosis pathway. In the case of influenza virus, the presence of cholesterol in its viral envelope is critical, but it is not essential in the target cell (Sun and Whittaker, 2003) , whereas the converse has been found for murine leukaemia virus (Lu and Silver, 2000) and duck hepatitis B virus (Funk et al., 2008) . In contrast, various strains of dengue virus and yellow fever virus enter and infect cells independently of cholesterol (Umashankar et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "Cholesterol is concentrated within the fluid mosaic bilayer of the plasma membrane, along with sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids, in specialised dynamic microdomains known as lipid rafts. These lipid assemblies are tightly packaged and ordered, allowing them to float within the rest of the fluid sea of disordered lipid bilayer (Simons and Ikonen, 1997) . The presence of cholesterol in the lipid rafts confers some resistance to detergents at low temperatures, allowing their separation from detergent-sensitive membranes by ultracentrifugation (Wilflingseder and Stoiber, 2007) . Due to this property, they are often referred to as detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Membrane rafts act as mobile platforms within the plasma membrane, and are involved in many important diverse cellular processes. Many proteins associate with lipid rafts, and these include GPI-anchored proteins, GTPases and kinases. Mounting evidence for the cholesterol dependency of productive virus entry suggests that many viruses may hijack these dynamic lipid raft platforms to utilise them as an entry portal to the cell.",

            "text": "Cholesterol is already known to be important at multiple stages of the HIV lifecycle. The virus assembles and buds out of lipid raft domains, and in doing so acquires a cholesterol and sphingomyelinrich envelope (Aloia et al., 1988 (Aloia et al., , 1993 Campbell et al., 2004 ) that is resistant to detergents but has a strikingly different composition to host cell membranes Chan et al., 2008) . The HIV accessory protein, Nef, functions on many levels to manipulate cellular cholesterol, including binding to cholesterol to enhance its trafficking Virology 386 (2009) to rafts (Zheng et al., 2003) , increasing cellular cholesterol biosynthesis (van 't Wout et al., 2005) and inhibiting cholesterol efflux by redistributing a major component of the cholesterol efflux pathway Castrillo et al., 2003) . Although in contrast, other studies have found that Nef specifically enhances the incorporation of sphingomyelin but not cholesterol into budding viral particles (Brugger et al., 2007) . The importance of HIV envelope lipid composition is highlighted by the finding that depletion of viral envelope cholesterol causes a dramatic reduction in viral infectivity Campbell et al., 2004 Campbell et al., , 2002 Guyader et al., 2002; Liao et al., 2003) . The early events in HIV entry, in which the viral envelope protein, gp120-gp 41, engages with the primary receptor CD4 on target cells, are well characterised. This interaction permits conformational changes within gp120 that allow additional binding to a co-receptor, usually CXCR4 for T-lymphocyte tropic strains, or CCR5 for macrophage tropic isolates. Co-receptor binding is the trigger for virus entry, during which the fusion peptide gp41, inserts into the cellular membrane to drive the fusion event. The lipid composition of the host cell is important for HIV entry. Cholesterol depletion of target cells using pharmacological agents prevents HIV entry, and render cells resistant to infection (Kozak et al., 2002; Liao et al., 2001; Nguyen and Taub, 2002b; Popik et al., 2002) . The association of CD4 with lipid raft domains is well accepted (Kozak et al., 2002; Nguyen et al., 2005; Percherancier et al., 2003; Popik et al., 2002) , but whether this association is required to support productive virus entry is disputed. One study found that mutant CD4 targeted to non-raft membranes did not permit efficient HIV entry (Del Real et al., 2002) , whereas alternative CD4 mutants that also prevent CD4 association with lipid rafts were found to support HIV entry (Percherancier et al., 2003; Popik and Alce, 2004) . The membrane localisation of the co-receptor molecules is somewhat controversial. CCR5 has been shown to associate with lipid rafts microdomains in cell lines by its presence in DRM fractions and its co-localisation with the raft associated lipid GM1 (Manes et al., 1999; Popik et al., 2002) . In contrast, studies in primary T cells identified CCR5 in the detergent-soluble membrane (DSM) fractions representing the non-raft membranes (Percherancier et al., 2003) . CXCR4 has been reported to be lipid raft-associated in 293 cells (Manes et al., 2000) but non-raft-associated in T cell lines (Kozak et al., 2002; Popik et al., 2002) . HIV-1 gp120 binding to CD4 molecules in lipid rafts has been proposed to cause recruitment of the HIV coreceptor into the lipid rafts or its interface, thus bringing all molecules required for HIV entry together (Kozak et al., 2002; Nguyen et al., 2005; Popik et al., 2002) .",

Numerous intracellular pathogens are taken up into macrophages by macropinocytosis, including Brucella (Watarai et al., 2002) and Afipia felis (Schneider et al., 2007) , and in these cases a requirement for lipid rafts has been established. Cholesterol is already known to play an important role in HIV replication of macrophages, with specific studies showing that Nef affects the normal function of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 to impair cholesterol efflux from infected macrophages (Mujawar et al., 2006) . Modulation of intracellular lipid metabolism in HIV-infected macrophages may facilitate virus budding from lipid raft associated membranes, but it is tempting to infer that cholesterol might also play an important role in the entry of HIV into macrophages.",

Given their critical position in HIV pathogenesis, and their highly specialized cellular architecture, we thought it necessary to investigate the requirement of cholesterol and role of lipid rafts in HIV-1 entry into macrophages. We have assessed the effect of depleting cholesterol in the macrophage plasma membrane, using four different pharmacological agents, on virus binding, entry and HIV receptor levels. Here we show that membrane cholesterol is essential for productive HIV entry into macrophages. Virus binding to cholesterol-depleted macrophages is not reduced but there are alterations to the surface expression of the receptor molecules. We observed virus co-localising with a marker of lipid rafts early after infection, and isolated macrophage CD4 and CCR5 in the membrane fractions representing raft microdomains. This, together with the sensitivity of virus entry to membrane cholesterol depletion, implies a role for macrophage lipid rafts in HIV-1 entry.",

HIV NL4.3 pseudotyped with JRFL envelope was bound to macrophages on ice, and warmed to 37\u00b0C in the presence of CTB-FITC and analysed at various times post entry. A representative experiment taken at 20 min post entry is shown in Figs. 1A-D, and shows virus co-localising with CTB-positive areas of the macrophage plasma membrane. The number of particles directly associated with GM1-positive membranes on the cell surface or in endocytic vesicles was quantified by taking 0.8 \u03bcm Z-slices through the cell and scoring the percentage of the total particles colocalising with CTB-FITC. Three consecutive Z-slice focal planes are shown in panels A-C. These slices start towards the bottom of the cell (A) and proceed upwards, and show many cell-associated virus particles clearly co-localising with CTB-FITC. The distribution of all virus particles and CTB-FITC is shown in a projection of Z-stack slices in panel D. Analysis of multiple cells (n = 10) at 20 min post entry shows approximately 34% (\u00b13.72 SEM) of total particles are colocalising with CTB-FITC. At later times post entry (40 and 60 min), there is a reduction in association of virus with CTB-FITC perhaps due to productive entry of most virus particles into the cytoplasm or degradation of the virus preventing its detection (Fig. 1E ).",

The effects of methyl-\u03b2 cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) are well characterised. This cholesterol-binding agent is not incorporated into the membrane but selectively extracts membrane cholesterol by binding it in a central non-polar cavity (Ilangumaran and Hoessli, 1998) . We incubated macrophages with various concentrations of M\u03b2CD in serum-free media, and measured the depletion of lipid rafts by detecting fluorescent CTB-FITC binding to the raft glycolipid GM1 by flow cytometry. CTB-FITC binding to drug-treated cells on ice was reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared to untreated cells confirming that M\u03b2CD effectively disrupts macrophage lipid rafts ( Fig.  2A) . The effect of this drug on cell viability was measured using the MTS cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 2B ) and showed that 1 h treatment with M\u03b2CD had no toxic effect on the macrophages. Quantification of the amount of free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters in 10 mM M\u03b2CDtreated macrophages using Amplex Red cholesterol quantification assay revealed a significant decrease (p = 0.01 by paired t-test) in all 6 donors tested with an average of 28.7% (\u00b120.4%) reduction compared to untreated control cells.",

The HIV envelope acquires cholesterol during budding, and M\u03b2CD can deplete this virion cholesterol, resulting in reduced virus infectivity (Guyader et al., 2002; Liao et al., 2003) . Therefore, to avoid this potentially confounding effect, cells were pre-treated with M\u03b2CD for 1 h, and washed extensively before the addition of virus, to ensure that any anti-viral effects observed were not due to decreased particle infectivity. M\u03b2CD treatment of macrophages was found to significantly reduce the generation of reverse transcription products following challenge with HIV BaL, at both concentrations tested, in macrophages derived from six different donors (Fig. 2C) . The inhibitory effect of M\u03b2CD could be partially reversed by the replenishment of cellular cholesterol with watersoluble cholesterol added for 1 h directly after M\u03b2CD treatment. Cholesterol replenishment restored virus reverse transcription to 43.5% of the untreated control (Fig. 2D ). The inhibitory effects of M\u03b2CD were also observed when p24 release from infected cells was measured by ELISA (Fig. 2E ). Reduced p24 release kinetics were observed in the early days post infection for all donors treated with M\u03b2CD, but the effects were less pronounced due to the longer length of this experiment and the measurement of multiple rounds of infection. Restoration of p24 release kinetics was observed upon cholesterol replenishment. Therefore, depletion of macrophage membrane cholesterol with M\u03b2CD severely inhibits the early steps of productive HIV infection of macrophages.",

Detection of these cell surface molecules using antibody labelling followed by flow cytometry shows that control macrophages express CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 at detectable levels ( Fig. 3A) . Treatment of macrophages with M\u03b2CD significantly decreases the cell surface expression of all receptors; CD4 by 35%, CCR5 by 100% and CXCR4 by 59%. Both CCR5 and CXCR4 expression levels are restored upon cholesterol replenishment, implying that the decrease is due solely to cholesterol depletion. Interestingly, replenishment with cholesterol does not restore the CD4 expression levels, but reduces them further to almost undetectable levels. This further reduction in CD4 expression may explain why cholesterol replenishment only partially restores HIV reverse transcription (see above). M\u03b2CD treatment of macrophages does not reduce the expression of all membrane proteins because the expression of CD71 (transferrin receptor), a known non-raft associated protein, was not reduced. Therefore, M\u03b2CD selectively alters the exposure of proteins found in the cholesterolrich lipid raft membranes without effecting non-raft associated proteins.

We adapted a procedure for isolating macrophage DRMs by disrupting cells by a combination of nitrogen cavitation and homogenisation followed by fractionation using an Optiprep density gradient. Western blot analysis of equal volumes of each fraction shows the expected localisation of the control proteins: flotillin-1 is located in fractions 4 and 5 representing the DRMs, and transferrin receptor is in fractions 8 and 9 indicative of the DSMs (Fig. 3B) . The receptor CD4 is present in the detergent-resistant fractions 4 and 5, and has a similar distribution to that of flotillin-1, although it is also present at low levels in fractions 6 and 7. CCR5 is present in detergent-resistant fractions 4-5 only.

M\u03b2CD treatment had the most pronounced effect on the receptors, with CD4 and CXCR4 being significantly reduced and CCR5 surface levels disappearing to almost undetectable levels. Cholesterol replenishment restored the levels of CCR5 and CXCR4 to similar levels as the untreated macrophages. Interestingly, CD4 expression was decreased further by cholesterol replenishment to almost undetectable levels. This complete knockdown in CD4 surface expression may explain why only a partial restoration of HIV reverse transcription was observed upon cholesterol replenishment of M\u03b2CD treatment macrophages. The addition of cholesterol may reduce CD4 expression to a level that is not favourable for HIV infection. The mechanism by which cholesterol further decreases CD4 surface expression is unknown but as these cholesterol-treated macrophages have a more granular appearance by flow cytometry, we can speculate that these macrophages actively take up cholesterol via an endocytic mechanism that may simultaneously internalise CD4. It is not uncommon for cholesterol replenishment to give rise to only partial restoration of infection; it has been reported for other viruses with the suggested explanation being that only one form of cholesterol may have been restored (Tang et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "The reduction in surface expression of HIV receptors following depletion of membrane cholesterol contrasts with findings using different cells. Treatment with similar concentrations of M\u03b2CD caused no reduction in plasma membrane expression of CD4 on primary Tcells (Percherancier et al., 2003) , PBLs (Viard et al., 2002) or PM1 T cell line . The reduction of CD4 surface expression upon M\u03b2CD and cholesterol treatment, to the best of our knowledge, seems to be unique to macrophages. This observation may result from the differences in CD4 expression and internalisation on macrophages compared to T lymphocytes. In macrophages, CD4 expression levels are 10 to 20-fold lower than they are in CD4+ T cells (Collman et al., 1990; Kazazi et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1999) , and CD4 internalisation rates are enhanced, likely due to the absence of Lck (Pelchen-Matthews et al., 1998) . Reduction in CXCR4 and CCR5 surface expression has been reported after treatment with a cyclodextrin derivative BCD in PM1 and primary T cells (Liao et al., 2001) . More importantly, cholesterol has been shown to be essential for the conformational integrity of CCR5 and CXCR4, and in these studies BCD treatment prevented the cell surface binding of antibodies specific for distinct CCR5 epitopes Taub, 2002a, 2002b) . Molecular simulations, and work with model membranes of defined composition show that the integrity of lipid raft microdomains is very sensitive to minor changes in overall cholesterol concentrations (Risselada and Marrink, 2008) . Most likely, cholesterol depletion in macrophages disrupts lipid rafts, thereby redistributing raft-associated proteins such as CCR5 to other membrane domains. It is possible that, in this new context, their conformation is altered to one that is no longer recognised by antibodies, and unable to sustain HIV entry.",

Conversely, filipin complex treatment significantly reduced CD4 expression levels and slightly decreased CCR5 levels but did not appear to have such a dramatic effect on the expression of other membrane proteins. The effects of cholesterol sequesteration on the surface expression of the HIV receptors, after nystatin and filipin treatment, have not been investigated before. Disruption of cholesterol biosynthesis with Lovastatin also reduced the surface expression of the HIV receptors on macrophages but not by significant levels.

The tightly structured cholesterol-rich lipid rafts, known as DRMs, can be isolated in the presence of ice cold 1% Triton X-100 and separated by ultracentrifugation. Macrophage CD4 and CCR5 were found in the DRM fractions along with flotillin-1 whose location in these membranes is well known. In contrast, CD71 was found in the soluble fractions reflecting its association with the non-raft membranes. Decreased HIV receptor, but not CD71, expression after M\u03b2CD treatment supports the notion that the HIV receptors are located in cholesterol-rich domains in macrophages. We provide additional evidence for the involvement of lipid rafts in virus entry by visualising virus uptake in parallel with a fluorescent marker of lipid rafts. At 20 min post infection, approximately a third of all cellassociated virions were co-localised with lipid raft membranes in punctate structures that appear to have been internalised and may resemble an endosomal compartment.",

Here, we show that in macrophages, CCR5 is also present in or associated with lipid rafts, and both receptors required for macrophage-tropic virus entry are localised in similar membrane domains. This is in agreement with electron micrographs showing CD4 and CCR5 (but not CXCR4) localised on the outer membranes of microvilli and blebs in macrophages, often in closely apposed microdomains (Singer et al., 2001) .

            "text": "The most likely explanation for the inhibition of productive HIV entry into cholesterol-depleted macrophages is that redistribution of (or conformational changes to) the HIV receptors render the macrophages unsusceptible to HIV infection. It is plausible that manipulation of membrane cholesterol may inhibit entry by other mechanisms, of which we suggest five possibilities. 1) Depletion of macrophage cholesterol may alter the lipid composition of the cellular plasma membrane so that it is no longer competent for fusion with the HIV lipid envelope. 2) Disruption of membrane rafts may prevent receptor migration and co-localisation. Both CD4 and CCR5 are mobile within cellular membranes (shown in CHO cells) with the chemokine receptor being significantly more mobile than CD4 and requiring membrane cholesterol for this mobility (Steffens and Hope, 2004) . 3) Signal transduction pathways induced upon CCR5 and envelope engagement may be required for virus entry (Harmon and Ratner, 2008) . Cholesterol has been shown to be essential for CCR5 signalling and its depletion may prevent these important signalling events in macrophages (Cardaba et al., 2008) . 4) HIV entry into macrophages may proceed by macropinocytosis, and cholesterol-depletion may block this uptake pathway in macrophages, as has been reported in brain microvascular endothelia (Liu et al., 2002) . 5) Lovastatin may inhibit HIV entry by another mechanism, as it has been shown that blockade of HMG CoA reductase impedes prenylation of small Rho GTPases that may be involved in post-entry signalling events (del Real et al., 2004) , or by diminishing HIV-1 attachment to target cells by suppressing ICAM1 LFA1 interactions (Giguere and Tremblay, 2004) . However, addressing these possibilities to determine the exact role of cholesterol will be challenging, especially using infectious macrophage-tropic virus and primary macrophages. Our study highlights the importance of cholesterol and lipid rafts in macrophage HIV infection. This provides further support for the use of cholesterol lowering pharmacological agents as anti-retroviral therapy by confirming their anti-viral effect in another pathogenically significant HIV target cell, the macrophage.",

In triplicate, 100 \u03bcL samples of the supernatant were then transferred to a 96 well plate and the absorbance read at 490 nm. Background absorbance readings from reagent and media alone were deducted and the values expressed as a percentage of untreated cells. To quantify cellular cholesterol levels, drug treated or control macrophages were detached by pipetting with PBS containing 5 mM EDTA and 12 mM lidocaine (Sigma), on ice. Cells were lysed and the cholesterol was extracted as previously described (Chung et al., 2005) . The amount of cholesterol was assayed with Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the concentrations were determined from a standard curve and normalised to the number of cells.",

Replication-defective HIV generated by the transfection of 293T cells with pNL4.3luc R-E-and pJRFL envelope was spinoculated at 4\u00b0C onto macrophage monolayers on coverslips. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min to allow absorbed virus to enter cells in the presence of 10 \u03bcg/mL of CTB-FITC. Lipid rafts were visualised by virtue of CTB-FITC fluorescence and HIV particles were detected by labelling with anti-p17 mAb. Z stack analysis was performed on random cells; three consecutive images (A-C) from the Z stack are shown with panel A towards the bottom of the cell and panel C nearer the top of the cell, panel D is a projection of all Z stack images. The perimeter of the cell is outlined and scale bar represents 20 \u03bcM. (E) The number of virus particles co-localising with CTB-FITC at 20, 40 and 60 min after binding was quantified by detailed Zstack analysis on 10 random cells for each time point. The total number of virions per cell was counted and then the % virions associating with CTB-FITC was determined. Error bars represent mean \u00b1 SD.",

(C) Productive HIV entry into M\u03b2CD treated macrophages was measured by detecting virus reverse transcription products by qPCR after 30 h of infection. The number of copies of HIV-1 DNA was normalised to the number of cells using a \u03b2-actin control.

Cell surface binding was measured by flow cytometry, and mean fluorescence intensity values were calculated by subtracting the isotype control fluorescence from the specific antibody fluorescence. Representative FACS plots of macrophages from one donor are shown, and graphs show mean \u00b1 SD of data acquired from five different donors. \u204e Significant difference p b 0.05, \u204e\u204e very significant difference, p b 0.01 and \u204e\u204e\u204e extremely significant difference p b 0.001 (paired t-test). (B) Macrophage membranes from lysed cells were incubated in 1% Triton X-100 and then fractionated using an Optiprep step gradient by ultracentrifugation. Fractions were collected, concentrated by TCA precipitation and 20 \u03bcL samples of each fraction were analysed by SDS-PAGE using antibodies to CD4, CCR5, flotillin and CD71.",
