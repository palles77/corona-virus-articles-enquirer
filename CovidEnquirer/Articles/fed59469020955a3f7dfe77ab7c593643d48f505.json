We purchased polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe caps measuring 6.2 cm in diameter and 4.0 cm tall, with an interior surface area of 108 cm2, from a local hardware store. The autoclavable polypropylene jars (McMaster-Carr) had a capacity of 125 mL each and measured 7.0 cm in diameter and 6.0 cm tall. We fabricated concrete bowls from type I/II Portland cement, natural sand (passes #4, 4.76-mm sieve) as the fine aggregate, silica sand (mostly retained on #10, 2-mm sieve) as the coarse aggregate, and water reducer (Sika Plastocrete 161). The bowls measured 9.6 cm in diameter across the top, 7.4 cm across the bottom, and 2.4 cm tall. We allowed the bowls to cure for one month and applied an acrylic sealant (Quikrete 8730-02) before use.",

We sequenced the samples to verify specificity of primers and probes for each bacteriophage. We amplified the converted cDNA samples using the previously specified qPCR reaction mixtures and volumes (intercalating dye or probe-based method), with a modified PCR machine protocol that omitted the final melt curve temperature ramp. We immediately removed amplified products from the PCR machine and further processed them or stored them at 4 \u00b0C for no more than 2 h before further processing. We analyzed aliquots of amplified PCR products by gel electrophoresis to verify base pair length and check for DNA carry over. We measured DNA concentration (Qubit fluorometer (Invitogen)) to determine volume of amplification product required for Sanger sequencing. We then cleaned amplified products by enzymatic treatment in sterile, optically clear vials, using Affymetrix ExoSAP-IT\u00ae, and incubated according to product recommendations on a Bio-Rad thermocycler.",
