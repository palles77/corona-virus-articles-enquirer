RNA-l directs the synthesis of 88-kDa (p88), 57-kDa (p57), 37-kDa (p37), and 27-kDa (p27) polypeptides and RNA-2 a 35-kDa (p35) polypeptide in vitro. The coding order of the RNA-l products was determined to be 5'-p27-p57-p37-3'. Antibodies to synthetic peptides representing the carboxyl terminal portions of p27 and psv tmrnunoprecipitated their respective polypeptides in addition to pSS, suggesting that pSS is a fusion protein. A frameshift heptanucleotide sequence element has been identified in RCNMV RNA-l.ln addition, a stable stem-loop secondary structure adjacent to the heptanucleotide sequence is predicted. Together, these sequence elements suggest that a ribosomal frameshifting event occurs which allows translational readthrough of the p27 open reading frame into the p57 open reading frame. generating the observed pSS product. An RNA-l expression construct fusing the p57 and the CP open reading frame was engineered to investigate the ribosomal frameshifting event. CP antibodies immunoprecipitated a fusion protein of the predicted size containing the carboxyl portion of CP. Site-directed mutagenesis of the frameshift element indicates that in vitro, pBB can also be expressed alternatively by suppression of an amber termination codon. Based on these data. we propose that the putative RCNMV RNA polymerase is an SS-kDa polypeptide expressed by a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism similar to those utilized by retroviruses.",

The numerical designations for specific nucleotides were assigned according to Lommel et al. (1 988) for RNA-2 and Xiong and Lommel (1989) for RNA-1. A series of 5' terminal deletion subclones were constructed by selective restriction of pRC1 at unique restriction sites except for pRC1Ba which required a partial digestion with BamHI. After diges1ion, overhangs were filled in with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment followed by recircularization of the plasmid by blunt-end ligation (Maniatis et aI., 1982) CP polymerase fusion constructs were prepared by restriction fragment deletion. An internal BamHI fragment was deleted from pRC1 to generate a fusion between the amino-half of p57 and the carboxyl-half of the CPo Mutagenesis of the ribosomal frameshifting element Several point and frameshift mutations in and around the RCNMV ribosomal frameshift site were constructed by site-specific mutagenesis of ssDNA templates using synthetic oligonucleotides as described by Kunkel et al. (1987) . The RCNMV frameshift heptanucleotide element was changed to a BYDV frameshift heptanucleotide element using the oligonucleotide 5'-CCCTIGAGGGTTTTAGGCG-3' in the clone pRC1 BYDV. The frameshift region was also changed to an amber termination codon by addition of a G residue after the p27 ORF termination codon using the oligonucleotide 5'-AmTTAGGGCGGCCCACTC-3' forming pRC1Amb. A single p88 ORF was generated by changing the amber termination codon to a tyrosine residue using the oligonucleotide 5'-ATInTACGGCG-GCCCACTC-3' (pRC1p88). The putative p57 ORF initiation codon was destroyed with 5'-CCAGTAGAGTCGA-CAAAAGTAAG-3' (pRC1Met1) and a second downstream inframe methionine codon was eliminated with 5'-ACATAATATIATAGTIAGT-3'(pRC1 Met2). Two mutations were constructed that were predicted to prevent p88 expression. The frameshift heptanucleotide was destroyed with 5'-AATCCCTIGAGGACTICTAGG-CGG-3' (pRC1NoFS) and a termination codon was incorporated in the -1 frame after the frameshift heptanucleotide sequence with 5'-CTIGAGGATInTAGT-AGGCTAACTCAGCTTICCGGT-3' (pRC1-1 Stop). All site-directed mutants were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.",

Thes e data suggest that p88 is a fus ion prote in resulting from translational framesh ift of the p2 7 ORF into the p57 ORF. It is unli kely that p88 is a cleavage precurs or of p57 and p27 because p27 is produ ced in much greater quantities than p57 . The fact that only a minor amount of p88 is produced in vitro is consistent w ith a readthrough event (Beier et el., 1984) or a ribosomal frameshifting event (Atkins et ei., 1990; Jacks et al., 1988a) . The RCNMV RNA-1 nu-XIONG ET AL. ...... cleotide sequence reveals that the p27 ORF and p57 ORF are in different reading frames (Xiong and Lommel, 1989) , excluding the possibility of a readthrough, and further suggesting the role of a ribosomal trarneshifting event in the synthesis of p88. For -1 ribosomal frameshifting in most eukaryotic genes studied to date, a heptanucleotide sequence is required, as defined by the ability to facilitate ribosomal frameshifting in accordance with the simultaneous slippage model. A frameshift heptanucleotide sequence element has been identified in RCNMV. This element is immediately upstream from the p27 ORF termination codon and is ve/y similarto those of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), RSV, and BYDV ( Fig.   5A ) as well as to those of the coronaviruses (Brierley et al., 1987) . The simultaneous slippage model can be applied to the RCNMV frameshift heptanucleotide (Fig.  5B) . tRNAAsp with attached nearly complete p27 and tRNNh' can base pair to the last two p27 ORF codons GAU and UUU in the ribosome P and A sites, respectively. Simultaneous slippage of the ribosome tRNA complex one nucleotide in the 5' (-1) direction results in their complexing with the p27 ORF -1 frame codons, GGA and UUU. This results in incomplete codon anticodon base pairing in the first and second position of tRNN\" and complete base pairing with tRNA Pho .",

For the carmo-and tombusviruses the greatest sequence similarity occurs in the region of the polymerase expressed as an amber terminator readthrough product. By amino acid sequence alignment, it appears that RCNMV utilizes a ribosomal trameshifting event in place of an amber terminator readthrough to achieve the modulated expression of the polymerase. This situation is parallel to the retroviruses, where some produce gag-pol fusions by an amber terminator readthrough mechanism while most use a ribosomal frameshift mechanism (Yoshinaka et ai, 19S5a, b) .",

This construct yielded a limited amount of pSS in vitro (Fig. 5) , illustrating that pSS is expressed regardless of whether a frameshift element or an inframe amber terminator is inserted within the RCNMV polymerase gene. This result suggests that the two polymerase expression modulation mechanisms are interchangeable, at least in vitro within the context of the RCNMV genome.",

According to the simultaneous slippage model, the BYDV frameshift heptanucleotide should form a more stable codon anticodon base pairing when shifted to the -1 position. Given this, we predicted that mutation of the RCNMV frameshift heptanucleotide to a BYDV heptanuc/eotide would increase the efficiency of pSS synthesis in vitro. However, no striking difference in pSS accumulation was observed. Factors determining frameshifting efficiency are likely to be more complex than codon-anticodon base-pairing.",
