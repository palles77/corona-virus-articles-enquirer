In this study, we detected the viromes of RNA viruses of one mock sample, one pooled duck feces sample and one pooled mink feces sample on the Personal Genome Machine platform using the sequencing libraries prepared by three methods. The sequencing primers were added through random hybridization and ligation to fragmented viral RNA using a RNA-Seq kit in method 1, through random reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in method 2 which was developed in our laboratory, and through hybridization and ligation to fragmented amplicons of random RT-PCR using a single primer in method 3. Although the results of these three samples (nine libraries) all showed that more classified viral families and genera were identified using methods 2 and 3 than using method 1, and more classified viral families and genera were identified using method 2 than using method 3, most of the differences were of no statistical significance. Moreover, 11 mammalian viral genera in minks were possibly identified for the first time through this study.",

Traditionally, rapid detection of RNA viruses has relied on nucleic acid-based techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers or probes, and/or serology-based techniques like enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Aziz et al., 2017) . In recent years, the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has innovated methods for RNA virus detection (Capobianchi et al., 2013; Shan et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014) . NGS can reveal a huge number sequences of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) within specimens through some random modes, and can detect various kinds of RNA viruses simultaneously thereby. Virome detection has been widely applied to identification of novel RNA viruses and research of RNA viruses (Masson et al., 2014; Paez-Espino et al., 2016; Webster et al., 2015) .",

Then the mixture was added with 4 \u03bcL 5 \u00d7 first-strand buffer, 1 \u03bcL dNTP (100 \u03bcM), 2 \u03bcL DTT (0.1 M), 1 \u03bcL RNaseOUT\u2122 Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor (40 U/\u03bcL) and 1 \u03bcL SuperScript \u00ae III Reverse Transcriptase (200 U/\u03bcl) (Invitrogen, USA), and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 15 min and 42\u00b0C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated at 70\u00b0C for 15 min. Then the reaction system was added with 1 \u03bcL RNase H (TaKaRa, Japan) and further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min. After purification using DynaMag\u2122-2 Magnet and Agencourt \u00ae AMPure \u00ae XP Reagent (Beckman Coulter, USA), the purified first-strand cDNA was used for the synthesis of the second-strand cDNA with primer B 15 N 6 (Table 1) at 70\u00b0C for 5 min. Then the mixture was added with 1 \u03bcL Klenow fragment (5 U) (NEB, USA), 5 \u03bcL 10 \u00d7 NEBuffer 2, 2 \u03bcL dNTP (100 \u03bcM) and 1 \u03bcL DTT (0.1 M), and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. This was followed by PCR amplification using a system containing the double-stranded cDNA template, 1 \u00d7 Phusion High-Fidelity Buffer, 10 \u03bcM primers A 30 and B 30 (Table 1) , 0.5 U Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB, USA). The PCR was performed as follows: 2 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 14 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 65\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. The library amplicons around 450 bp were collected with the E-Gel \u00ae SizeSelect\u2122 Agarose Gel.",

Therefore, we assumed that all mammalian viruses identified in the mink feces sample were possibly mink viruses. Of these mammalian viral genera, Mamastrovirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, Vesivirus, Cardiovirus, Picobirnavirus, Rotavirus, Orthoreovirus, Gyrovirus, Ambidensovirus and Bocaparvovirus from mink had not been reported previously. Some other viral genera, like Betanodavirus, Cripavirus, Chlorovirus, Trichovirus, Marafivirus, Tobamovirus, Giardiavirus and Pelamoviroid, were assumed to be from other sources (e.g., mink feed or environment), as similar viruses from plants, fishes, insects or unicellular eukaryotic organisms had been identified previously (Table S2 ). Some avian viruses in the genera of Influenzavirus A, Avastrovirus, Gammacoronavirus and Avibirnavirus which were identified in sample 3 might be from mink feed which contained fresh meat, giblets and eggs of chickens and ducks. It should be mentioned that avian influenza virus can replicate in mink.",

However, all of the differences were of no statistical significance by the Chisquare test (P > 0.05), except that significantly more viral families and genera were identified by method 2 than by method 1 for samples 2 and 3 (P < 0.05).",

Therefore, they are more costly than method 2 which does not require any commercial kits. Moreover, method 1 is of great technical difficulty as it requires RNA fragmentation whose quality is difficult to control. Theoretically, methods 2 and 3 can be started from viral RNA of a concentration below RNA quantification limits, while method 1 should be started from viral RNA above the RNA quantification limits. Since most clinical samples collected from a single person or animal contains viral RNA below the RNA quantification limit, method 1 is not suitable for most clinical samples, although it may be suitable for other applications, e.g., transcriptome detection. We selected the three samples containing much amount of viral RNA in this study in order to obtain NGS data using all the three methods. In the future, it is of significance to compare methods 2 and 3 in detecting viromes of RNA viruses in some clinical samples containing limited viral RNA.",

Seven of these 18 families (Circoviridae, Dicistroviridae, Iflaviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and Virgaviridae) were also identified in the duck feces sample through this study. Hits of Mimiviridae and Retroviridae were also identified in the duck feces sample through this study, but they were assumed to be unreliable through our online BLAST analysis. The remaining nine families including Baculoviridae, Herpesviridae, Iridoviridae, Marseilleviridae, Nodaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Partitiviridae, Poxviridae and Totiviridae were not identified through this study, while ten families including Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Potyviridae, Tombusviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Reoviridae, Adenoviridae and Avsunviroidae identified in this study were not identified in the recent report. The differences can be attributed to that the samples were collected at different sites, regions and time and detected using different methods. It is of value to conduct further studies to make clear whether some viruses identified in the duck feces belong to new viral species. Detection of viromes of minks has not been reported previously, and a total of 11 mammalian viral genera in minks might be reported for the first time through this study. It is of value to conduct further studies to make clear clinical significance and taxonomic status of these viruses.",
