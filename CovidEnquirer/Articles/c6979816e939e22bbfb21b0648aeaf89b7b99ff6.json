The dictionary definition of latent is \"hidden or concealed, present or existing but not manifest.\" A latent virus infection is one in which infective virus is sometimes or always undetectable by conventional methods in secretions, excretions, or body fluids of the host animal. Conventional methods for infective virus detection would include cultivation in cell culture and demonstration of transmission to in-contact animals. Although the virus may be hidden using such conventional detection methods, the use of very sensitive techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for viral antigen detection or hybridization techniques to reveal viral nucleic acid sequences in host cell DNA are used to confirm the presence of virus or at least its genetic material.",

During this phase, opportunity for the virus to transfer to a new susceptible host is restricted, but the virus survives because of persistence.

Otherwise, host immunity will normally eliminate the virus (Fig. 2) . The immune response is directed against the virus either when that virus is within the host cell (by direct cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or by antibody-mediated and complement-mediated cytotoxicity) or when it is outside the host cell (by antibody). In either case, the virus infection has a finite duration, typically 1 to 2 weeks.

Alternatively, viral genetic material becomes integrated into the genetic material (DNA genome) of the host cell.

Of the cats studied, 82 per cent were chronic carriers. The interval between the known FVR infection and the re-isolation of virus was often many months. There was always some delay or lag period between the initiation of corticosteroid treatment and first recovery of virus. This was typically 1 week, but the range was from 4 to 21 days. It was also demonstrated that other \"stressful\" situations, such as re-housing or, less reliably, parturition, also stimulated shedding from carrier cats. For re-housing, the lag period was similar to that with corti- costeroid administration (mean 7.2 days), but following parturition, the delay was as long as 52 days. It was hypothesized that the stress of late lactation, as kittens approached weaning, precipitated virus re-excretion. In these studies, there were many instances of \"spontaneous\" virus re-excretion not associated with an identified trigger factor.",

One approach is to enhance maternal antibody by booster vaccination of queens with killed vaccine between 1 month and 1 week before kittening. This will help protect the kitten for longer and allow for age resistance. If the mother is a suspected carrier, the kittens are weaned early and moved to an isolated room at 5 weeks of age.

Carrier cats have anticalicivirus antibody in their serum, but it is either incompletely neutralizing or unable to effectively reach virus in the epithelial locations.

Virus is present in urine for up to 22 days and in saliva for up to 41 days after infection. 69 In a pathogenesis study, 2 distemper virus antigen was detected by fluorescent antibody labeling in neurons of the cerebrum, brain stem, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum of two dogs that developed convulsions 41 days and 60 days after infection. Distemper virus antigen was also detected in the sebaceous glands and epidermis of the foot pads of both dogs. In another study, persistence of CDV was demonstrated in the uvea up to 56 days after infection. 76 Two neurologic diseases of adult dogs, the diffuse demyelinating panencephalitis of old dog encephalitis (ODE) and a chronic multifocal encephalitis, are associated with CDV. These syndromes may occur weeks, months, or years after initial systemic CDV, or they may develop without any preceding clinical illness. Lincoln and colleagues 43 demonstrated CDV antigen by immunofluorescence in neurons and glial cells of the cerebral cortex in two cases of ODE. However, those authors could not recover virus nor transmit infection. Subsequently, successful isolation of CDV was accomplished from two of six dogs diagnosed as ODE and two of six dogs with chronic distemper encephalitis. 35 Three isolations were made by explant culture of brain tissues, and the fourth isolation was made in bladder epithelial cell.culture. The presence oflgG rather than IgM antibody in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of these dogs suggested persistent rather than recent virus infection. Vandevelde and colleagues also isolated CDV from two of three cases of multifocal encephalitis but not from three cases of ODE, although all ODE cases and two of the three multifocal encephalitis cases were positive for CDV antigen by immunofluorescence. It is not clear that the mechanisms of persistence of CDV are different for ODE and multifocal encephalitis, nor is it clear that they involve chronic low-grade productive infection by virus in selected cells, or that there is a stage of incomplete virus replication. Although it is difficult to extrapolate from in vitro studies, the persistence of a laboratory strain of CDV in cell culture was associated with classical defective interfering (DI) particles released into the supernatant of the culture. However, persistence with a strain ofCDV from ODE involved large numbers of nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm of infected cells that might have been defective but were not released and remained cellassociated. 78 In addition to the finding of anti-CDV IgG antibody in the CSF of dogs with chronic CDV neurologic disease, the continuing presence of interferon in the cerebrospinal fluid also facilitated CDV entry and persistence. 79 The factors determining persistence of CDV and the pathogenesis for chronic neurologic disease in dogs remain unclarified, but virus strain is probably of considerable importance. 68 \u2022 77 Measles, Multiple Sclerosis, and Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis Multiple sclerosis (MS) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) are two chronic neurologic diseases that have some similarities pathologically to the chronic forms of canine distemper. Although both of these diseases are linked with measles virus, the association is only strong in the case of SSPE. Measles virus has been occasionally recovered from brain tissue of SSPE patients by co-cultivation. 34 \u00b7 49 Measles virus nucleic acid sequences have been detected in MS brain tissues. Although measles vaccine virus only rarely leads to persistent infection and neurologic disease in man, it should be used with caution. In view of this and the relatively poor protection conferred by measles vaccine against distemper, 4 there is little to recommend the use of measles vaccine in distemper prophylaxis in puppies.",

The immune complexes may result from a delayed triggering of the immune response to a persistent FIPV infection in carrier cats. It could also occur in a presensitized cat following re-exposure to virus. There may be carrier cats that do not themselves develop FIP disease but they are capable of shedding the virus either continuously or sporadically.

In one study, 100 per cent of neonatal kittens became viremic after exposure to FeLV, whereas only 85 per cent of 8-week-old genetically related kittens became viremic with an equal dose of the same virus strain. 32 Following successful infection, initial virus multiplication occurs in a variety of lymphoreticular cells, particularly those in the tonsil, blood germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, thymic medulla of kittens, and bone marrow. Many of these infected cells will contribute to a viremia, but the release of infected neutrophils and platelets from the bone marrow is the main source for viremia. This viremia of bone marrow origin commences up to 6 weeks following initial infection, and it may be prevented by early and adequate immune response. The most important component of this response is virusneutralizing (VN) antibody directed against the FeLV envelope glycoprotein, gp70. The other important part of the immune response is antibody against the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA).

Viremic cats will usually be shedding FeLV in saliva and also in feces and urine. 33 It has been estimated that in the overall cat population, assuming a 50 per cent infection rate, 1.8 per cent of FeLV-infected cats become persistently viremic. 18 The rate may be much higher (up to 30 per cent) in FeLVendemic catteries. 28 When persistent viremia occurs, it is highly likely to lead at some subsequent time to development of neoplastic or non-neoplastic FeLV-related diseases such as non-regenerative anemia. 27 \u2022 33 Thus, it is estimated that 0.5 per cent of FeLV-infected cats or, rather, less than one third of persistently viremic cats will die of virus-positive lymphosarcoma or leukemia, with a median induction period of 17.6 months. The estimates for non-neoplastic FeLV-related deaths are 1.3 per cent of FeLV-infected cats, or just over two thirds of persistently viremic animals, with a median induction period of 24.6 months. 18 Only rarely will persistently viremic cats subsequently become nonviremic.",

            "text": "Persistently viremic cats are important as sources of FeLV infection. The identification and removal of these animals are an important and successful control measure in clearing FeLV from endemically infected catteries. 29 Usually VN antibody and other antibodies cannot be demonstrated in persistently viremic cats, but some of these cats do have antibody to gp70, FOCMA, p15e, and other viral proteins. 45 \u2022 47 These carriers may remain healthy for years and maintain antibody titers. They will probably eventually succumb to FeLV-related disease, particularly those associated with excess antibody that forms immune complexes with antigen resulting in glomerulonephritis and hypocomplementemia. 38 \u2022 41 \u2022 71 An alternative to persistent viremia following FeLV infection with a delayed or inadequate immune response is a nonproductive (masked) virus persistence. As a retrovirus, FeLV has the property of inserting pro-viral DNA in the DNA of host cat cells. Evidence suggests that marrow myelomonocytic precursor cells and certain nodal T lymphocytes are predilection cells for such integrated persistence. 64 The masked Fe LV may be reactivated from these cells by in vitro propagation of marrow cells, stimulation of nodal lymphocytes by the T-cell mitogen staphylococcal protein A, and by adrenal corticosteroid hormones. 46 \u2022 56 \u2022 63 \u00b7 64 Viral recrudescence in vivo may occur in response to hormonal changes, immunologic changes, and aging. 64 Reactivation may be detected as relapsing viremias. 56 It could be responsible for maintaining high levels of anti-viral and anti-FOCMA antibodies.H Partial viral expression may be detected by the presence in serum of p27 antigen (ELISA test positive), but without viremia (indirect fluorescent antibody test negative). 45 \u2022 66 It is likely that a high proportion (more than 70 per cent) of cats infected with FeLV but that do not develop persistent productive infection are nonproductively but persistently infected. Of these, a small number will reactivate under natural circumstances. After protracted incubation periods of months or years, some will develop FeLV-related disease. These animals account for those lymphosarcomas that are FeLV-negative but FOCMApositive. 30 Kittens can be born with nonproductive FeLV infection that can be reactivated by in vitro culture of marrow and thymus cells. It has been suggested that maternally derived VN antibody may be responsible for maintaining the congenital infection in an apparently nonproductive form. 64 There is no evidence that the recently introduced feline leukemia vaccine (Leukocell*) has any effect on either persistent viremia or nonproductive persistent infections once these have occurred; further study is needed, however.",

There is a balance between virus replication with cell destruction and replenishment with susceptible cells. The extent of virus replication may be restricted by a limited population of susceptible cells, by defective virus particles that interfere with infection by complete particles, or by an immune response that is incomplete. Evasion of the immune response is enhanced by an isolated location, immunosuppression by the virus, or by antigenic drift of the virus. l. The virus replicates in a limited population of cells or at a slowed rate so that there is a steady state between cell destruction and replacement of a susceptible population of cells. 2. The virus evades the immune response by replicating in relatively isolated sites (such as epithelial cells or nerve cells). 3. The virus evades the immune response by causing virus-induced immunosuppression. 4. The virus evades the immune response by continual mutation, effecting antigenic drift. 5. The virus is masked within cells as a defective infection.Partial replication may occur, but the particles are incomplete or defective. Even if released from the cell, these defective particles are incapable of establishing productive infection in other cells, and they may interfere with and block infection of those cells by complete virus. Defective interfering (DI) particles are found with virtually all viruses studied. The proportion of DI particles in a population of virions is variable. Virus persistence in a static, nonreplicative form implies that viral RNA or DNA is present in cells but inhibited or repressed. There may be a block to translation from viral",
