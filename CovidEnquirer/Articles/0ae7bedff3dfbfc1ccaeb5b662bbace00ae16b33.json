            "text": "Case summary A 6-year-old female neutered domestic shorthair cat from Cyprus was presented with multiple ulcerated skin nodules. Cytology and histopathology of the lesions revealed granulomatous dermatitis with intracytoplasmic organisms, consistent with amastigotes of Leishmania species. Biochemistry identified a mild hyperproteinaemia. Blood extraction and PCR detected Leishmania species, Hepatozoon species and 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum' (CMhm) DNA. Subsequent sequencing identified Hepatozoon felis. Additionally, the rRNA internal transcribed spacer 1 locus of Leishmania infantum was partially sequenced and phylogeny showed it to cluster with species derived from dogs in Italy and Uzbekistan, and a human in France. Allopurinol treatment was administered for 6 months. Clinical signs resolved in the second month of treatment with no deterioration 8 months post-treatment cessation. Quantitative PCR and ELISA were used to monitor L infantum blood DNA and antibody levels. The cat had high L infantum DNA levels pretreatment that gradually declined during treatment but increased 8 months post-treatment cessation. Similarly, ELISA revealed high levels of antibodies pretreatment, which gradually declined during treatment and increased slightly 8 months post-treatment cessation. The cat remained PCR positive for CMhm and Hepatozoon species throughout the study. There was no clinical evidence of relapse 24 months post-treatment. Relevance and novel information To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report of a cat with leishmaniosis with H felis and CMhm coinfections. The high L infantum DNA levels post-treatment cessation might indicate that although the lesions had resolved, prolonged or an alternative treatment could have been considered.",

Owing to a recent diagnosis of cutaneous leprosy in a different cat from the same household, the lesion from the scapula was surgically excised for histopathological examination and imprint smears from one of the forelimb lesions were made for cytological examination. The latter revealed high numbers of macrophages, with an epithelioid appearance and occasional giant multinucleated macrophages, as well as low numbers of plasma cells and small lymphocytes. Numerous organisms consistent with Leishmania species amastigotes were noted in parasitophorous vacuoles of the macrophages and freely in the background (Figure 2a ). Histopathological examination of the lesion (Figure 2b ) revealed mild acanthosis and focal ulceration of the epidermis. Within the subjacent dermis, extending from the denuded surface to the deep dermis/panniculus, was an irregular, densely cellular area composed of macrophages, with low numbers of multinucleated forms. The macrophages contained numerous intracytoplasmic vacuoles (5-7 \u03bcm in diameter) within which were densely amphophilic round-to-oval organisms (approximately 1 \u03bcm diameter). The macrophages were mostly in random array; rarely groups of the cells were aggregated to form small granulomas. There were lighter admixtures of neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells. The cytological and histopathological diagnosis was granulomatous dermatitis with intralesional intracytoplasmic amastigotes consistent with Leishmania species.",

The cat was PCR positive for Hepatozoon species using conventional PCR, as well as positive for Leishmania species and CMhm using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Subsequent sequencing identified H felis and L infantum. 3 Owing to the small size of the amplicon generated by the initial Leishmania species PCR 4 an additional PCR was performed, targeting the rRNA ITS1 locus of L infantum, 5 followed by sequencing. The forward and reverse sequences of the L infantum were assembled and constructed into a consensus sequence, which was deposited in the GenBank database (MF140257). The DNA sequence was 100% identical to a partial 18S rRNA ITS1 sequence of L infantum (GenBank KX664454) over 258 bp, as found by BLAST analysis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Phylogeny (Figure 3 ) showed the L infantum from this Cypriot cat to cluster with species derived from dogs in Italy and Uzbekistan, a sandfly in Iran and a human in France. The cat was PCR negative for Mycoplasma haemofelis, 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis' (CMt), Bartonella henselae and Ehrlichia/Anaplasma species, and seronegative for feline leukaemia virus antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies.",

In contrast, meglumine antimoniate has only been described in a few cases of FeL. 10, 11 Additionally, a combination of allopurinol and N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate in a cat with FeL due to L infantum was reported to have led to successful clinical resolution and significant reduction of the parasitic load, suggesting that this therapeutic protocol could also be considered for FeL. 12 The cat in this case had complete clinical resolution of the cutaneous lesions during the treatment period with no relapse by month 24 after completion of the 6 months of allopurinol treatment. However, the PCR results post-treatment showed that elimination of L infantum had not occurred, indicating progressive subclinical infection. Given the potential role of the cat as a secondary reservoir and the zoonotic nature of L infantum, an alternative treatment could have been implemented for this patient, such as a combination of allopurinol with meglumine antimoniate or N-methylglucamine antimoniate.",

Persichetti et al reported in a recent study that although ELISA serology was better for diagnosing clinical FeL compared with the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), the latter was more sensitive than ELISA to detect subclinical infection. 16 The same study also recommended Western blot as the preferable serological test for FeL since it yielded a higher sensitivity and specificity in comparison to ELISA and IFAT. The pathogens infecting this cat were recently found to have a PCR prevalence of 3.1% for L infantum, 58.0% for Hepatozoon species and 33.0% for CMhm in nonhealthy Cypriot cats, 3 with L infantum and Hepatozoon canis also being reported in the canine population of this island. 17 Significant associations between L infantum infection and H felis and CMt infections in cats using multivariable logistic regression have been reported, suggesting impaired host immune response due to the multiple coinfections. 3 This could have been a component leading to the persistent L infantum parasitaemia in this cat in the face of the Hepatozoon species and CMhm coinfections.",
