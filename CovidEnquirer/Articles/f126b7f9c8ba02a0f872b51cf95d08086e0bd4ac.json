Alanine substitution of ExoN 25 catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN 26 activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased 27 fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) 28 genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in 29 parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated 30 enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive 31 fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-32 inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA 33 polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the 34 observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness 35 observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can 36 compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors 37 restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) 38",

These data suggest that the increased replication of P250 173 viruses relative to WT-MHV is not fully accounted for by increased RNA synthesis. In addition 174 to RNA synthesis defects, ExoN(-) CoVs have up-to 20-fold increased mutation frequencies and 175 profoundly increased sensitivity to nucleoside and base analogs relative to WT CoVs (13, 14, 16, 176 17, 38). To determine whether nucleoside analog sensitivity of MHV-ExoN(-) was altered by 177 long-term passage, we treated cells infected with parental and passaged viruses with the base 178 analog, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is converted intracellularly into a nucleoside analog that 179 incorporates into growing RNA strands and causes A:G and U:C mutations. For simplicity, we 180 hereafter refer to 5-FU as a nucleoside analog. Incorporation of 5-FU is increased in the absence 181 of ExoN activity (16). All viruses displayed a concentration-dependent decrease in viral titer but 182 differed greatly in their susceptibility to 5-FU (Fig. 4C ). At 120\u00b5M, WT-MHV P3 titers were 183 reduced by ~1 log 10 , while MHV-ExoN(-) P3 titers were undetectable (> 5 log 10 -fold reduction). 184",

The model predicts that five 220 mutations are located close to surface of the protein (Fig. 6B ). All three modeled zinc finger 221 domains contain one NS mutation (F216Y, Y248H, L473I). Two mutations, D128E and F216Y, 222 are located near the interface between nsp10 and nsp14, though neither site has previously been 223 implicated in nsp10-nsp14 interaction (15, 64, 65). One NS mutation resulted in a D272E 224 substitution in ExoN motif III, a metal-coordinating active site residue. We previously reported 225 that alanine substitution of D272 results in an ExoN(-) phenotype (14), but the viability or 226 phenotype of a D272E substitution was not tested in that study. These data suggest that a 227 network of residues evolved to regulate nsp12 and nsp14 activity or stability in the ExoN(-) 228 background. 229 230 Fixed mutations in nsp12 and nsp14 in MHV-ExoN(-) P250 directly correlate with 231 increased resistance to multiple nucleoside analogs. To determine approximately when the 232 mutations in nsp12 and nsp14 arose, we performed di-deoxy sequencing across these protein-233 coding regions roughly every 20 passages (P10, 31, 50, 72, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 234 240) . By this method, we detected consensus NS mutations at P10, P50, and P160 for nsp12, and 235 at P50 and P160 for nsp14 (Fig. 6) . Both nsp12 and nsp14 carried their full complement of P250 236 consensus mutations by P160, except for a minority variant (D913E) in nsp12 maintained at 237 <50% of the population between P200 and P250. These passage levels correlated with increased 238 replication of MHV-ExoN(-) (Fig. 2B ) and with decreasing sensitivity to 5-FU (Fig. 7A ). Neither 239 replication nor 5-FU sensitivity of MHV-ExoN(-) changed substantially between P160 and P250. 240",

WT-MHV evolved increased replication 296 kinetics over 250 passages, with few consensus mutations arising in the WT-MHV P250 genome. 297 In contrast, MHV-ExoN(-) accumulated 8-fold more mutations than WT-MHV, none of which 298 occurred at the ExoN-inactivating mutations.

Mutations within nsp12-P250 conferred greater resistance to nucleoside 301 analogs than nsp14-P250, suggesting that secondary mutations within nsp14 cannot restore ExoN 302 activity without the full complement of catalytic DE-E-D residues. These results further support 303 our studies and those from other exonucleases that the motif I DE residues are absolutely 304 required for ExoN activity.

However, the active site compositions of DEDDh 317 exonucleases, such as the Klenow fragment, are so stringent that even conservative mutations 318(D-to-E or E-to-D) reduce ExoN activity by >96% (70). Thus, intermediate amino acid changes 319 may not have a selective advantage compared to motif I AA, limiting the evolutionary pathways 320 to reversion.

Whether these mutations resulted from genetic drift or positive selection 323 remains unclear. Nevertheless, our data show that MHV-ExoN(-) can adapt for increased fitness 324 without fully restoring exoribonuclease activity.

Second, five of 337 the mutations lie in or near structural motifs important for fidelity regulation in other RdRps. 338 Amino acid substitutions in the fingers and palm domains have been repeatedly shown to affect 339 viral RdRp fidelity (25, 34), and we have recently reported a fingers mutation (nsp12-V553I) that 340 likely increases the fidelity of the MHV RdRp (17). Our modeled structure predicts that nsp12-341 P250 contains three mutations in the palm domain and one in the fingers domain, with the 342 M814K thumb domain mutation lying near the palm (Fig. 6A). Third, exchange of nsp12-P250 343 alone into the background of MHV-ExoN(-) reduced the susceptibility of MHV-ExoN(-) to three 344 different nucleoside analogs (Fig. 8). Although resistance to a single nucleoside analog can 345 evolve without increasing overall fidelity, resistance to multiple nucleoside analogs suggests a 346 broadly increased capacity to discriminate modified nucleotides {Arias:2008bp, Sierra:2007dg, 347 Zeng:2013dg, Guo:2016fx}. Thus, nsp12-P250 is likely a high-fidelity polymerase. However, 348 nsp12-P250 only partially accounts for the MHV-ExoN(-) P250 nucleoside analog resistance 349 phenotype (Fig. 8), suggesting a possible limit to the compensation achievable by mutating the 350 RdRp alone. Further, the effects of mutations in nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250 are not additive 351 and may be antagonistic when isolated from the whole passaged virus (Fig. 8), indicating that the 352 relationships between nsp12-and nsp14-P250 mutations are likely evolutionarily linked with 353 those in other MHV proteins. In fact, a substantial component of the evolved resistance to 354 nucleoside analogs cannot be explained by nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250, alone or together. In 355 support of this hypothesis, we identified several nonsynonymous mutations in other replicase 356 proteins, such as nsps 8, 9, 13, and 15.

            "text": "chikungunya virus and foot-and-mouth disease virus can evolve to increase fidelity 361 (79) and alter the frequency of ribavirin-induced mutations(80), respectively. SARS-CoV nsp9 362 has RNA-binding activities and is proposed to participate in the multi-protein replicase complex 363 (39, 81), and MHV nsp15 is a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease (82). Both could plausibly be 364 involved in modifying polymerase activity. Additionally, it remains possible that evolution for 365 increased fidelity could involve proteins outside the canonical replication complex (nsps7-16), 366 including those in the structural and accessory cassette. Thus, while immediate studies will focus 367 on testing whether replicase proteins nsp8, 9, 13, and 15 regulate fidelity, it is exciting to 368 consider the possibility that this virus-directed discovery approach will reveal novel interactions 369 between multiple MHV proteins.370 371 Has MHV-ExoN(-) P250 evolved robustness as a defense against ExoN(-) infidelity? Three 372 of the nucleoside analogs used in this study (5-FU, ribavirin, and 5-azacytidine) reduce virus 373 titers at least in part through mutagenesis (16, 66, 67). Although the resistance of MHV-ExoN(-) 374 P250 to these RNA mutagens may be fully explained by the evolution of a high-fidelity 375 replication complex, an additional possibility is that MHV-ExoN(-) P3 evolved increased 376 mutational robustness. Mutational robustness is the capacity of a virus to buffer the fitness 377 effects of mutations, which are most frequently detrimental or lethal (8-12). Thus, in a low-378 fidelity virus like MHV-ExoN(-) P3, genomic mutations which reduce the fitness cost of 379 subsequent mutations can provide a selective advantage (83-85). The relationship between 380 fidelity and robustness has been demonstrated for poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3: wild-type 381 ExoN(-) P250. Synonymous changes can alter codons to reduce the probability of non-384 conservative amino acid changes (87). Alternatively, the increased population size of MHV-385 ExoN(-) P250 could promote robustness by a \"safety-in-numbers\" effect, allowing efficient 386 purging of low-fitness mutants while maintaining population fitness (88). Large populations also 387 increase the likelihood of co-infection, allowing complementation between viral genomes. We 388 did not observe an effect of increased replication in MHV-ExoN(-) P250 nucleoside analog 389 resistance (Fig. 5), but a recent study with poliovirus suggests that mutagenized populations have 390 elevated coinfection frequencies (89). Thus, complementation may contribute to MHV-ExoN(-) 391 P250 nucleoside analog resistance. Conflicting evidence exists regarding whether mutational 392 robustness itself affects the sensitivity to RNA mutagens (86, 87, 90); nevertheless, the 393 robustness of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 merits further investigation. 394 395Conclusions. One of the defining features of CoV replication is the proofreading activity of the 396 nsp14 exoribonuclease that is a critical determinant of CoV replication, fidelity, and fitness. We 397 here show that CoVs also have the capacity to compensate for loss of ExoN activity through a 398 network of mutations in nsp12, nsp14, and elsewhere in the genome. Thus, while nsp14-ExoN 399 appears to play a dominant role in CoV replication fidelity, its activity is likely closely tied to a 400 highly evolved network of proteins. The demonstrated co-adaptation for replication, fidelity, and 401 competitive fitness within MHV-ExoN(-) supports the hypothesis that these roles are linked 402 functionally and evolutionarily.
