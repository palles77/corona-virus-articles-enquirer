A systematic profiling of the immune vulnerability landscape of 2019-nCoV is lacking, which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism, peptide vaccine development, and antiviral antibody development. In this study, we predicted the potential of all the 2019-nCoV viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and form linear antibody epitopes. We showed that the enrichment for T cell and B cell epitopes is not uniform on the viral genome, with several focused regions that generate abundant epitopes and may be more targetable. We showed that genetic variations in 2019-nCoV, though fewer for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus, which should be considered in the development of therapies. We create an online database to broadly share our research outcome. Overall, we present an immunological resource for 2019-nCoV that could significantly promote both therapeutic development and mechanistic research.",

Despite the lower mortality rate of 2019-nCoV compared with SARS and MERS, the scale of the 2019-nCoV contagion has already caused more casualties than either of them, as of this writing. Early research into 2019-nCoV has mostly described its epidemiological features (1, 3), reported the possible curative effect of remdesivir (4) , and characterized its basic genomics features (5, 6) .",

Such analyses could also inform anti-viral immuno-therapeutic development, which can be either T cell-based or B cell-based. Antibodies can neutralize viral infectivity in a number of ways, such as interference with binding to receptors, block uptake into cells, etc. For SARS-CoV, the human ACE-2 protein is the functional receptor, and anti-ACE2 antibody can block viral replication (7) . On the other hand, previous studies have indicated a crucial role of both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells in SARS-CoV clearance (8, 9) , while Janice Oh et al also observed that development of SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies requires CD4 + T helper cells (8) . In fact, there are examples of vaccines for influenza that contain both antibody and T cell inducing components (10, 11) .",

We found that the number of MHC class I and class II binders, weighted by the HLA allele frequency in the Chinese population, are not spatially uniform across the viral genome. And there are a small number of genomic regions that showed high peaks of immunogenicity corresponding to a large number of MHC binders in a small neighborhood, which could be better potential vaccine targets (Sup. Table 1 ). The MHC binding peptide profiles of a different racial population (i.e. European ancestry) are shown in Sup. Fig. 1 . Interestingly, the T cell epitope intensities (number of binders weighted by allele frequency) are higher overall in the European population than the Chinese population, suggesting that the Chinese population may be more vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection. Individual HLA alleles are examined in Sup. Fig. 2 . The above analyses are conducted for the 2019-nCoV reference genome. However, the viral strains that have been sampled and sequenced so far are highly similar to each other (a segment of multiple alignment shown in Fig. 1b) .",

Similarly scanning through all 2019-nCoV proteins of the reference genome (Fig. 1c) , we found that the viral genome is also not uniformly enriched for B cell epitopes. In particular, one small segment of the Orf1 protein and the N protein are enriched for predicted B cell epitopes (Sup. Table 2 ). Lastly, we focused on the receptor-binding motif of the 2019-nCoV S protein, which attaches to the ACE-2 protein for entry into the human cell (17) . We blasted the motif binding domain sequence of the 2019-nCoV S protein with that of SARS, and found there is a poor conservation between the two S proteins (Fig. 1d) , which suggests that prior antibodies developed for SARS may not work for 2019-nCOV.",

In comparison, SARS (Fig. 2b) and MERS (Fig. 2c) have both accumulated significant variation between the different strains, probably due to their much longer contagion history in humans. Interestingly, in 2019-nCoV, the genomic regions with higher mutational rates and lower mutational rates can already be discerned (Fig.  2a) , and they seem to be rather conserved with those of SARS and MERS (Fig. 2bc) .

In Fig. 2d , we showed the relative mutational rates of the viral genomic regions that are enriched for abundant CD4 T cell epitopes, CD8 T cell epitopes, and linear antibody epitopes, in each of the three viruses. It can be seen from Fig. 2d that the mutational rates in 2019-nCoV are still much lower than those of SARS and MERS in these epitope-enriched regions, as expected. But interestingly, the mutational rates of the CD8 epitope-enriched regions are higher than those of the CD4 epitope-enriched regions in both SARS and MERS. This may be due to selection pressure inflicted by the CD8 + T cells, which are the major cytotoxic T cell population. The same may happen to the 2019-nCoV virus as well, but this remains to be proved.",

For the line plots, the viral genomes were binned by every 60 nucleotide, and the number of T cell and B cell epitopes falling into each window is calculated. For T cell epitopes, a sum of the number of epitopes weighted by the corresponding ethnic population's HLA allele (A, B, C, and DRB1) frequency is calculated to form the T cell and B cell immunogenicity strength for that population. The genetic variation rate at each nucleotide is calculated by examining all viral strains and counting the proportion of strains with a different nucleotide or with an insertion/deletion, with respect to the reference genome. The genetic variation rates are also binned by the same length of windows and averaged.",
