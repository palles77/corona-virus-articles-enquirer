            "text": "Seven to eight species of viral subgenomic mRNAs are produced in coronavirus-infected cells. These mRNAs are produced in different quantities, and their molar ratios remain constant during viral replication. We studied RNA elements that affect coronavirus transcription efficiency by characterizing a series of cloned coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNAs containing an inserted intergenic sequence, from which subgenomic DI RNA is transcribed in MHV-infected cells. Certain combinations of upstream and downstream flanking sequences of the intergenic sequence suppressed subgenomic DI RNA transcription, yet changing one of the flanking sequences to a different sequence eliminated transcription suppression. The suppressive effect of certain combinations of flanking sequences, but not all combinations, could be counteracted by altering the intergenic sequence. Thus, the combination of intergenic sequence and flanking sequence affected transcription efficiency. We also characterized another set of DI RNAs designed to clarify which transcription step determines the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs. Our study indicated that if subgenomic mRNAs were exclusively synthesized from negative-strand genomic RNA, then the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs were most likely determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA. If negative-strand subgenomic RNAs were templates for subgenomic mRNAs, then the relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs probably were determined after synthesis of the genomic-sized template RNA used for subgenomic-sized RNA transcription but prior to the completion of the synthesis of subgenomic-sized RNAs containing the leader sequence. The relative molar ratios of coronavirus mRNAs, therefore, seem to have been established prior to a putative replicon-type amplification of subgenomic mRNAs.",

            "text": "Many eukaryotic RNA viruses express their gene(s) by producing subgenomic mRNA(s) in infected cells. Coronavirus, an enveloped virus containing a large positivesense single-strand RNA, belongs to this group. Cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a prototypic coronavirus, produce seven to eight species of virusspecific mRNAs that make up a 3\u0408 coterminal nested set structure (Lai et al., 1981; Leibowitz et al., 1981) . These mRNAs, which are named mRNAs 1 through 7 in decreasing order of size (Lai et al., 1981; Leibowitz et al., 1981) , are produced in different quantities, and their molar ratios remain constant during MHV replication. The 5\u0408-end of the MHV genomic RNA and the subgenomic mRNAs start with a leader sequence that is approximately 72 to 77 nucleotides (nt) long (Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et al., 1983) ; the presence of the leader sequence in subgenomic mRNAs is a unique characteristic in coronavirus and arterivirus (de Vries et al., 1990) , which is closely related to coronavirus. Curiously, on the genome, the leader sequence is not found any place besides the 5\u0408-end, yet the subgenomic mRNAs have the leader sequences fused with the mRNA body sequences. The mRNA body sequences begin from a UC-UAAAC transcription consensus sequence or a very similar sequence of intergenic sequences, which is located upstream of each MHV gene. Coronavirus transcription undergoes a discontinuous transcription step, in which the leader sequence somehow joins to the body of the subgenomic RNA (Jeong and Makino, 1994; Zhang et al., 1994) . Genomic-sized and subgenomic-sized negativestrand RNAs, each of which corresponds to one of the subgenomic mRNA species, are also present in coronavirus-infected cells (Sethna et al., 1989) . These negativestrand RNAs contain an antileader sequence at the 3\u0408end and a poly U sequence at the 5\u0408-end (Sethna et al., 1991) .",

            "text": "Another way to envision negative-strand subgenomic RNA synthesis is provided by the idea that processing of the full-length negative-strand genomic RNA occurs after transcription from the genome. Subgenomic mRNA synthesis would follow processing of subgenomic negative strand RNAs; the leader sequence could join the body sequence during processing of negative-strand genomic RNA or during subgenomic mRNA synthesis on negativestrand subgenomic RNA. These two models propose that negative-strand subgenomic RNAs are synthesized prior to the synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs. All other transcription models propose that subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized prior to the synthesis of negative-strand subgenomic RNA. Subgenomic mRNAs may be synthesized by the processing of the positive-strand genomic RNA , or by transcription from negativestrand genomic RNA by a unique leader-primed transcription mechanism, in which short``free'' leader RNAs are used as primers for subgenomic mRNA synthesis , or by polymerase jumping from leader sequence to intergenic sequence during subgenomic mRNA synthesis on the negative-strand genomic RNA template . In these models, once subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized, negative-strand subgenomic RNAs are copied on subgenomic mRNAs. Negative-strand subgenomic RNAs may have several different effects on transcription. These negative-strand subgenomic RNAs may be templates for subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; Schaad and Baric, 1994) , or may become replicons which undergo replication to amplify more subgenomic mRNA and negative-strand subgenomic RNAs (Sethna et al., 1989) . Alternatively, these negative-strand subgenomic RNAs may not participate in subsequent transcription; they may be dead-end transcription products (Jeong and Makino, 1992) . All of the coronavirus transcription models postulate several transcription steps for the production of mature mRNAs; one of these unidentified transcriptions steps is that which defines the relative molar ratios of subgenomic mRNAs.",

Instead, for studying transcription we use coronavirus defective interfering (DI) RNAs that contain an inserted intergenic sequence from which transcription in DI RNA-replicating, coronavirus-infected cells yields a subgenomic DI RNA with a leader sequence (Makino et al., 1991) . Studies using MHV DI RNAs identified RNA elements that affect transcription (Jeong et al., 1996; Makino, 1992, 1995; Makino and Joo, 1993; Makino et al., 1991; van der Most et al., 1994; van Marle et al., 1995) . One study showed that a series of DI RNAs, each of which contains a 0.4-kb-long sequence derived from various regions of the MHV sequence with an intergenic sequence in the middle, transcribe different amounts of subgenomic DI RNA (Jeong et al., 1996) , demonstrating that sequences flanking the intergenic sequence affect transcription. Other studies showed that differences in the sequence of the inserted intergenic sequence also affect transcription (Jeong et al., 1996; Joo and Makino, 1992; van der Most et al., 1994) . A DI RNA containing a 12-nt-long intergenic sequence (12-nt sequence) (UCUAAUCUAAAC) that is flanked by 0.2-kblong sequences upstream and downstream of the genes 6\u00b17 junction transcribes only a small amount of subgenomic DI RNA, while a DI RNA containing an 18-ntlong naturally occurring intergenic sequence at genes 6-7 (18-nt sequence) (AAUCUAAUCUAAACUUUA) in the place of the 12-nt sequence transcribes a significantly higher amount of subgenomic DI RNA (Jeong et al., 1996) , demonstrating that the 18-nt sequence overcomes the flanking sequence-mediated transcription suppression.",

Northern blot analysis of total cytoplasmic RNAs using probe 1, which corresponds to nucleotides 1488\u00b1 1610 from the 5\u0408-end DE5-w3, showed that FDI-6/7wt produced a significantly larger amount of subgenomic DI RNA than FDI-6/7 M (Fig. 2) . These data were consistent with our previous result (Jeong et al., 1996) . As shown in Fig. 2 and subsequent figures, sometimes Northern blot analyses did not show a distinct MHV-A59 genomic RNA band; this was probably due to minor degradation of RNAs.",

In these clones, one of the flanking sequences of FDI-EagI, FDI-NruI, and FDI-6/7 M was replaced with one of the 0.2-kb sequences that flank the naturally occurring intergenic sequences at genes 6\u00b17, 2\u00b13, and 1\u00b12. Northern blot analysis using a 32 Plabeled probe 1 showed that all of the newly constructed FIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the structure of MHV genomic RNA, DE5-w3, and DE5-w3-derived insertion mutants with flanking sequences. The 0.2-kb flanking sequences that were inserted into DE5-w3-derived insertion mutants are shown as 0.2-kb fragments. Each mutant has a 0.4-kb-long insertion between the AflII site and SacII site of DE5-w3. Molar ratio (sG/G) represents the average molar ratio of subgenomic DI RNA to genomic DI RNA from at least three independent experiments (see Fig. 2 ). The location of probe 1 used for Northern blot analysis (see Fig. 2 ) is also shown. DI RNAs efficiently transcribed subgenomic DI RNA (Fig.  4) . FDI-1/EagI M, which had a naturally occurring 0.2-kb upstream flanking sequence at gene 1\u00b12 plus a 0.2-kb downstream flanking sequence of the EagI site, efficiently transcribed subgenomic DI RNA, while FDI-EagI produced only a very low level of subgenomic DI RNA. These data may be interpreted as meaning that the 0.2-kb upstream flanking sequence of FDI-EagI contained a transcription suppressive element(s). However, FDI-EagI/2 M, which had the 0.2-kb upstream flanking sequence of FDI-EagI and a 0.2-kb-long downstream flanking sequence at gene 1\u00b12, efficiently transcribed subgenomic DI RNA; putative transcription suppressive element(s) at the 0.2-kb upstream flanking sequence did not suppress transcription. Comparison of FDI-EagI and FDI-EagI/2 M may indicate the presence of the transcription suppressive element(s) at the 0.2-kb downstream flanking sequence of the EagI site. Again this putative transcription suppressive element(s) did not work at all in FDI-1/EagI. These data indicated that the presence of either the 0.2-kb upstream or downstream flanking sequences of the EagI site did not suppress transcription. Transcription suppression only occurred when the 0.2-kb upstream and downstream flanking sequences of FDI-EagI were combined. Studies of the remaining two sets of DI RNAs resulted in the same conclusion; transcription suppression only occurred when the DI RNAs contained both upstream and downstream 0.2-kb fragments around the NruI site and when DI RNA had both upstream and downstream 0.2-kb fragments at the gene 6\u00b17 junction. In addition, we did not see any relationships between the transcription efficiency and the pres-ence of a large open reading frame in subgenomic DI RNA among DI RNAs.",

The structures of the subgenomic DI RNAs of both DI RNAs were expected to be the same, because both DI RNAs had the 12-nt sequence and had the same 0.2-kb downstream flanking sequence.

The present study showed that transcription suppression only occurred with certain combinations of upstream and downstream flanking sequences. No single flanking sequence showed dominant transcription suppression. These data suggested that both upstream and downstream flanking sequences affect transcription efficiency. An alternative interpretation may be that some flanking sequences, e.g., flanking sequences at genes 1\u00b12 and 2\u00b13 (see Figs. 3 and 4) , have a dominant transcription enhancing element(s) that overcomes the suppressive effect caused by other flanking sequences, e.g., 0.4-kb sequences at the genes 6\u00b17 junction, the EagI site, and the NruI site. We also showed that changing the intergenic sequence from a 12-nt sequence to an 18-nt sequence did not always overcome flanking sequencemediated transcription suppression.

The sample was initially incubated at 94\u00b0C for 5 min and then incubated at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 42\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and that incubation was repeated for 30 cycles. A complete MHV DIssE cDNA clone, DE5-w3 (Makino and Lai, 1989b) , was used as a parental clone for DNA construction. We obtained two 0.2-kb-long PCR products, each of which had either the 12-nt sequence or the 18-nt sequence at its end, by incubating the MHV-JHM cDNA or cloned MHV DI cDNA with two specific primers, one of which contained either the 12-nt or 18-nt sequence. The two purified PCR products made from each template were mixed, and the second PCR yielded a 0.4-kb-long product that had either the 12-nt sequence or the 18-nt sequence in its middle. The final PCR product was inserted into the AflII site and SacII site of DE5-w3 to produce the DI cDNAs used in the present study (Fig. 1) . For all of the constructs, we sequenced the inserts that were derived from the PCR products to confirm the presence of specific sequences and the absence of extraneous mutations.",
