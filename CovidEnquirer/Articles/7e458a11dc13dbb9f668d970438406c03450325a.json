Histocompatibility (//) loci control expression of cell surface molecules that mod ulate major immunological phenomena, such as the recogni tion of foreign tissue. For example, the time, onset, and speed of skin graft rejection are controlled by two groups of// loci. The major group is called H-2 and is located on chromosome 17. These genes cause rapid rejection (10-20 days) of grafts that display foreign H-2 antigens. Minor H loci groups are scattered throughout the genome and are responsible for de layed graft rejection. Genes associated with the H-2 complex also control other immunological functions, such as cell-cell interactions in primary immune responses and the level of re sponse to a given antigen. Immune-mediated responses to in fectious agents such as viruses and complement activity are influenced directly or indirectly by the H-2 complex (Klein, 1975) .",

            "text": "Inbred mice are also valuable for research in other fields such as immunology, oncology, microbiology, biochemistry, phar macology, physiology, anatomy, and radiobiology. For exam ple, inbred histocompatible strains are used extensively as do nors of plasma cell tumors to immortalize cell lines (hybridomas) that secrete highly uniform, monospecific immunoglobulin in vitro, theoretically in unlimited quantities. This technology has made the full range of functional mouse anti body molecules available for study. Transplantable murine plasmacytomas also have provided specific components of immunoglobulin biosynthesis, including the immunoglobulin genes, mRNA, and intermediates in the assembly of immu noglobulin genes (Potter, 1983) . (Lyon, 1981; Green, 1981) Laboratory mice are identified by strain or by breeding sys tem. The geneology of major inbred mouse strains is presented in Figs. 1-3. Seven breeding system designations have been developed (Table I) and each requires technical skill and a firm understanding of mammalian genetics. Inbred strains were first developed in 1909 by C. C. Little and offer a high degree of genetic uniformity. They are, for practical purposes, genet ically identical to other mice of the same strain and sex. They are produced by brother-sister matings for at least 20 genera tions. By contrast, random bred mice are genetically hetero geneous, and are often produced by breeding systems that min imize inbreeding. Individual random bred mice may differ in coat color, histocompatibility loci, enzyme polymorphisms, and other characteristics. Random pairing is best planned with the aid of tables of randomized numbers or a randomizing de vice. However, true random breeding may be difficult to achieve in a small research colony by random pairing. In a population of 25 breeding pairs, for example, heterozygosity will decrease at 1% per generation with standard randomiza tion techniques. A random breeding program that is easy to manage is the circular pair mating system, where each pair is mated only once. Conceptually, cages are visualized in a circle and each cage contains one breeding pair in the nth generation. Another ' 'circular\" set of cages serves as the nucleus for the n + 1 generation. Each mated pair from the nth generation con tributes one female and one male for the n + 1 generation. Random breeding is accomplished by assigning the male and female from the nth generation to different cages rather than to the same cage. Other useful random mating systems are the cousin system and another circular system (see Table I ).",

Mice are sometimes housed in suspended cages with open-mesh bottoms that allow excrement to fall through to a collecting pan. Suspended caging is rarely used for breed ing because neonatal thermor\u00e9gulation is difficult to maintain without nesting material. Cage mesh should be stainless steel rather than galvanized steel, since the former is easier to clean and less susceptible to rust.

If Kraft (1980) . the mouse had to depend on the evaporation of body water to prevent elevations of body temperature, it would go into shock from dehydration. The mouse has no sweat glands, it cannot pant, and its ability to salivate is severely limited. Mice can partially compensate for changes in T A by varying body tem perature (\u00c3 \u00c2 ). For example, the T B of a mouse can increase from 33.8\u00b0 to 37.2\u00b0C when the T A increases from 20\u00b0 to 35\u00b0C. It adapts to moderate but persistent increases in environmental temperature by a persistent increase in body temperature, a persistent decrease in metabolic rate, and increased vascularization of the ears to increase heat loss. Its primary means of cooling in the wild is behavioral-retreat into a burrow. In the confinement of a cage, truck, or plane, mice do not survive well in heat and begin to die at an ambient temperature of 37\u00b0C. Thus, the mouse is not a true endotherm. In fact, the neonatal mouse is ectothermic and does not have well-devel oped temperature control before 20 days of age. The thermoneutral zone for mice varies with strain and with conditioning, but is about 29.6\u00b0-30.5\u00b0C, narrower than that of any other mammal thus far measured.

Thymectomy in adult mice produces no immediate effect, but several months later mice may develop a progressive decline of cir culating lymphocytes and impaired cellular immune responses.

Rising titers of gonadotropins evoke signs of sexual maturity at about the same age. In the female, estrogen-dependent changes such as cornification of vaginal epithelium at the vaginal opening can occur as early as 24 to 28 days. Puberty is slightly later in the male (up to 2 weeks). Sexual maturation varies among strains and stocks of mice and is subject to seasonal and environmental influences. Mating behavior and the ability to conceive and carry fetuses to parturition are under complex hormonal bal ances mediated by the anterior pituitary.",

Phe romones have been divided into two broad categories, primer pheromones and releaser pheromones (Wilson, 1970) . Primer pheromones, are probably detected by chemosensor organs that relay messages to the CNS, which in turn modulates be havior. Releaser pheromones trigger a prompt, CNS-mediated, behavioral response in a recipient. Pheromones most fre quently affect developmental and reproductive processes. Primer pheromones produced by males also regulate the re productive physiology of female mice (Shorey, 1976) . More than one response can be elicited by the same pheromone. Pheromone communication must be accounted for in the manage ment of mouse colonies, particularly when subtle behavioral traits or reproductive performance are critical. Behavior in mice also is determined by environment and genotype. Male BALB/c mice, for example, are prone to fights and have a high prevalence of bite wounds around the head, back, shoulders, perineum, and tail. Aggressive behav ior can sometimes be diminished by caging together only males from one litter or males paired prior to weaning. Hair nibbling and whisker chewing are examples of social domi nance (Fig. 12 ). These traits may be an exaggeration of inher ited grooming behavior. Dominant mice usually retain their whiskers, hence the name ''barber\" mouse. Hair loss from barbering must be distinguished from hair loss due to ectoparasitism, microbial dermatitides, and abrasions from im properly designed cage covers.

Carrier mice can have persistently high concentrations of virus in many organs, in cluding kidney and salivary gland. Mice can shed virus in sali va, nasal secretions, and urine and can infect contact-exposed mice. Horizontal spread is facilitated by close contact, but rapid horizontal transmission is not characteristic. Self-limit ing, immunizing infections occur in adults whereby further spread of virus is halted. If virus infects neonates, persistent infection is more commonly established. Persistently infected neonates usually reach breeding age and can perpetuate infec tion in a breeding colony. Thus introduction of a single LCMV carrier mouse to a breeding colony can eventually result in a high prevalence of persistently infected mice. Transmission in utero, is also a primary mode of spread. Horizontal transmis sion occurs commonly among hamsters. Mice transmit LCMV to hamsters, which in turn transmit virus to other hamsters, mice, and humans. Although hamsters can remain viremic and viruric for relatively long periods (months), most appear to eventually clear virus and recover (see Chapter 5).",

Virus can be isolated by mouse inoculation with fecal material or by inoculation of BHK-21 cells with intestine or CNS tissue. Brains of paralyzed mice can be tested for MEV hemagglutinin using type O human red blood cells.",

The eggs are laid at night and leave the host in a mucous layer of fecal pellets. They require 6-7 days at 24\u00b0C to become infective and can survive for weeks outside the host. Ingested eggs hatch and larvae reach the middle colon where they enter crypts and remain for 4 to 5 days. They move to the proximal colon about 3 weeks after infection of the host.

Populations are limited by factors such as self-grooming, mutual grooming, the presence of hair (which is required for acariasis), and immunological responses, which tend to pro duce hypersensitivity to mites. Inherited resistance and suscep tibility also affect clinical expression of acariasis. Mite popula tions, for example, vary widely among different stocks and strains of mice housed under similar conditions. Lice and mites generally favor the dorsal anterior regions of the body, particularly the top of the head, neck, and withers (areas least amenable to grooming), but in severe parasitism, all areas of skin can be infested. Skin lesions of acariasis and pediculosis include pruritis, scruffiness, and patchy hair loss, and in severe cases, ulc\u00e9ration and pyoderma initiated or com pounded by self-inflicted trauma. Histologically, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and chronic dermatitis may occur. Long standing infestation provokes chronic inflammation, fibrosis and proliferation of granulation tissue. Ulcerative dermatitis associated with acariasis may have an allergic pathogenesis. Lesions resemble allergic acariasis in other species and are as sociated with mast cell accumulations.

Trichophyton can be cultured on Saboraud's agar. Plates are incubated at room tem perature (22\u00b0-30\u00b0C) and growth is observed at 5-10 days. The zoonotic potential of ringworm is discussed in Chapter 22 by Fox et al.",

Recombinant vi ruses have recently been discovered that can infect mouse cells and heterologous cells and are associated with spontaneous leukemia development in high leukemia strains such as AKR mice. Their phenotypic expression is controlled by mouse gen otype. Endogenous retroviruses are transmitted vertically through the germ line. Horizontal transmission is inefficient but can occur by interuterine infection or through saliva, sputum, urine, feces, or milk.

Removal of the unaffected male usually ends the fighting, and the wounded animals re cover. However, a previously submissive male may become dominant when an aggressive male is removed and fighting may resume. Fighting has some strain predilection, and is es pecially notorious among BALB/c males, but tail lesions re sembling bite wounds have been reported in other strains.",

Both sexes may engage in this activity, and sometimes females may be dominant. Regional alopecia, especially around the muzzle, may result from abrasion against cage sur faces. Improperly diluted disinfectants may also cause regional hair loss. Metal tags used for animal identification may cause pruritis and self-induced trauma. Clipping prior to application of experimental compounds to the skin may cause pruritic re sponses and can augment lesions that interfere with test results.
