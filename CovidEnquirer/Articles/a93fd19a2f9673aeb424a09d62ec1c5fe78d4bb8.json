            "text": "A novel herpesvirus was detected in a captive mob of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) during diagnostic workup for individuals with ulcerative cloacitis. Virus was initially detected in tissues using a consensus herpesvirus PCR. No viral inclusions or particles had been evident in routine histologic or transmission electron microscopic sections of cloacal lesions. Virus was isolated from samples and transmission electron microscopy of the resulting isolates confirmed that the virus was morphologically consistent with a herpesvirus. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR product from tissue samples and from the isolates revealed that the virus was in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae and was distinct from other known herpesviruses. The correlation between the lesions and the novel virus remains unknown. Two herpesviruses, both in the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, have previously been described in macropods and are known to cause systemic clinical disease. This is the first reported gammaherpesvirus within the order Marsupialia, and may provide valuable information regarding the evolution and phylogeny of this virus family. Based on current herpesvirus nomenclature convention, the authors propose the novel herpesvirus be named Macropodid herpesvirus 3 (MaHV-3). #",

            "text": "MaHV-1 was first identified by Finnie et al. (1976) in a captive mob of parma wallabies (Macropus parma). The viral infection produced fatal systemic disease resulting in severe clinical signs including pyrexia, respiratory signs, conjunctivitis, and anogenital vesicles (Finnie et al., 1976; Acland, 1981) . MaHV-2 was later identified in 1978 in captive grey dorcopsis (Dorcopsis muelleri luctuosa) and quokkas (Setonix brachyurus) . This virus also resulted in fatal systemic disease characterized by conjunctivitis and lesions on the oral and anogenital mucous membranes. Latent infection with an unclassified alphaherpesvirus was described in the eastern grey kangaroo (M. giganteus) (Guliani et al., 1999) . Herpesvirus infections have also been reported or suspected in other macropod species including tammar wallabies (M. eugenii) and western grey kangaroos (M. fuliginosus), as well as in two species in the family Potoroidae-brush-tailed rat kangaroos (Bettongia penicillata) and rufous rat kangaroos (Aepyprymnus rufescens) (Dickson et al., 1980; Callinan and Kefford, 1981; Wilks et al., 1981) . In addition to these natural infections, transient experimental infections with MaHV-1 have been produced in the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) (Zheng et al., 2004) . A serologic survey revealed that 23% of wild marsupials tested and 41% of captive marsupials in Australia tested had circulating serum-neutralizing antibodies to a parma wallaby herpesvirus (Webber and Whalley, 1978) . However, it is unknown whether the seropositivity reflects exposure to known macropod herpesviruses, previously undescribed herpesviruses, or cross-reaction with antibodies to other antigens unrelated to herpesvirus exposure.",

However, the exact modes of transmission and the presence of the novel virus in wild populations of eastern grey kangaroos remain unknown. It is possible that advancing age and concurrent disease caused recrudescence of a latent herpesviral infection in a few individuals. Virus particles could then be spread throughout the rest of the mob through direct contact from breeding activity and other interactions. It is possible that the presence of neoplasia in geriatric individuals caused immunosuppression, resulting in a recrudescence of a latent herpesviral infection.",

The branching of the alphaherpesviruses from the betaand gammaherpesviruses has been estimated to have occurred approximately 374-413 million years ago, and the branching of the betaherpesviruses from the gammaherpesviruses approximately 331-351 million years ago . Within the gammaherpesviruses, the divergence of the Rhadino-virus/Percavirus lineages has been estimated to have occurred 70-73 million years ago . Looking at host species, the divergence between marsupials and placental mammals has been estimated to have occurred 193-186 million years ago (van Rheede et al., 2006) , which would occur temporally after the estimated beta/gamma split but before Rhadinovirus/Percavirus divergence.

The herpesvirus polymerase is the gene for which the most comparative sequence from other herpesviral species is available. Additionally, when looking at evolutionary relationships of more distantly related organisms, the continued accrual of mutations resulting in homoplasy can diminish the ability to correctly resolve phylogeny, making a rapidly mutating gene a poor choice. Genes for which there is strong negative selection will have fewer nucleotides with a history of multiple changes, making them a better choice for resolving phylogeny over greater distances. Genes that are critical for basic organismal functions and are not under heavy immune selection are often highly conserved. Therefore, viral polymerases are usually good choices for long-range phylogeny (Attoui et al., 2002; Gonzalez et al., 2003; Knopf, 1998) .",

While the analysis in this study supports clear divergence of the proposed Macavirus from other genera, the division between Rhadinovirus and Percavirus is not as clear, and the new Rhadinovirus appears to be paraphyletic in this analysis. One possible explanation for the differences in this analysis from previous analyses is the inclusion of MaHV-3 and Afrotherian gammaherpesviruses in this analysis. MaHV-3 clusters with the Rhadinovirus/Percavirus/ Macavirus lineages, but does not cluster with any one genus, and may be a distinct lineage. Other possible explanations for the differences seen are the assessment of multiple alignment algorithms and substitu-tion models for optimality in this study. Both nucleotide sequence alignment and amino acid substitution models may have significant effects on results (Morrison and Ellis, 1997, Whelan and Goldman, 2001) .

Comparison of sequencing data of a PCR product obtained from the virus to sequencing data from other known herpesviruses classifies the novel virus in the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae.
