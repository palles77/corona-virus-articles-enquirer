(1985) These enveloped viruses have a nucleocapsid protein (N; M, 50K) associated with the single-stranded plus-sense RNA genome and two glycoproteins embedded in the membrane (for review see Siddell et al., 1983) . The larger of the two glycoproteins is the spike (S) or peplomer protein which in IBV has two or three copies of each of glycopolypeptides Sl (M, = 90K) and S2 (= 84K) (Cavanagh, 1983a. b) . One function of S2 is to anchor the spike in the virus membrane (Cavanagh, 1983b) . Sl and S2 are derived by cleavage of a precursor glycopropolypeptide So (Stern and Sefton. 1982) . The amino acid sequence of So of the Beaudette strain of IBV has been deduced by nucleotide sequencing (Binns et al., 1985) . Amino acid sequencing of the amino-(N-) terminus of [\"Hlserine labelled Sl showed that Sl started immediately after the putative signal peptide at the N-terminus of So. This indicated that S2 was contained within the C-terminal half of So and that the N-terminus of S2 was generated when So was cleaved near the middle of the molecule. This paper described partial amino acid sequencing of S2 from two serologically related strains of IBV and correlation with the nucleotide sequence of So in order to identify the propolypeptide cleavage site.",

Thus two alphaviruses have Arg-His-Arg-Arg and another has Arg-Ser-Lys-Arg preceding the N-terminal serine residue of the E2 glycopolypeptide (Garoff et al., 1980; Rice and Strauss, 1981; Dalgarno et al., 1983) . Two retroviruses have Arg-Arg-Lys-Arg or Arg-His-Lys-Arg at the env propolypeptide (precursor polypeptide) cleavage site (Shinnick et al., 1981 : Schwartz et al., 1983 . Paramyxovirus SV5 (Paterson et al., 1984) and orthomyxovirus fowl plague virus (Porter et al., 1979) have cleavage sequences Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg and Lys-Lys-Arg-Glu-Lys-Arg in the fusion propolypeptide and haemagglutinin propolypeptide. respectively. Many proproteins of polypeptide hormones have two basic residues at the posttranslational cleavage site (Docherty and Steiner. 1982). One type of enzyme involved in the cleavage of proproteins has trypsin-like activity (Docherty and Steiner, 1982) . We have shown that So of IBV can be cleaved by trypsin, as can the spike precursor of MHV (Sturman and Holmes, 1977) . Thus, the process by which So is cleaved to yield Sl and S2 probably resembles that of many other proproteins. It would be expected that a sequence as basic as the Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg cleavage site of IBV-Beaudette would be at the surface of the spike protein. The phenylalanine residue in the middle of the cleavage peptide is a potential target residue for chymotrypsin.",

The N-terminus of S2 is hydrophobic although not more so than several other regions of So. Whether the N-terminus of S2 has an important role in membrane fusion, as is the case with the N-terminus of HA1 and Fl (for a review, see White et al., 1983) is not known although cleavage of the MHV spike precursor is necessary for fusion-from-without (Sturman and Holmes, 1984) . The cleavage of the orthomyxovirus haemagglutinin proprotein (HAo) and the paramyxovirus fusion proprotein is essential for full biological activity (Klenk and Rott, 1980) . Cleavage enables efficient fusion of the virus membrane with the plasma or endosome membrane to occur; the RNA genome then enters the cytoplasm.",
