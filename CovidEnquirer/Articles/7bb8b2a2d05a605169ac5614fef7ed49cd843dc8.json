            "text": "Astroviruses are small single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses of approximately 28-30 nm in diameter belonging to the family Astroviridae (Fauquet et al., 2005) . These round star-shaped viruses have been detected in many species of birds (genus Avastrovirus) and mammals (genus Mamastrovirus), including humans. Generally, astrovirus infections in animals are associated with enteric diseases, with mild to severe signs such as diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, sometimes associated with fever and immunodepression (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005) . In some cases, astroviruses can cause extra-enteric infections, as is the case of the avian nephritis virus (AVN), known to cause interstitial nephritis and growth retardation of young chickens (Imada et al., 2000) and the duck astrovirus (DAstV), that cause severe hepatitis and mortality rates up to 50% in ducklings (Gough et al., 1984) . Some astroviruses do not cause a detectable disease: the bovine astrovirus (BAstV) is asymptomatic or induces only slight changes in faeces of experimentally infected calves (Bridger et al., 1984) and the feline astrovirus (FAstV) cause disease only occasionally (Marshall et al., 1984b) . In other instances, the association of astroviruses with diseases is simply unknown, as the case of the recently discovered astroviruses in insectivorous bats (Chu et al., 2008) . The most well characterized Veterinary Microbiology 139 (2009) [147] [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] A B S T R A C T Astroviruses have been described in several animals species frequently associated with diarrhoea, especially in young animals. In dogs, astrovirus-like particles have been observed sporadically and very little is known about their epidemiology and characteristics. In this paper, we describe the detection of astrovirus-like particles in symptomatic puppies. Furthermore, for the first time in this species, the presumptive identification made by electron microscopy was confirmed by genetic analysis of the viral RNA conducted directly on the clinical specimens. Genetic sequences of ORF2 (2443 nt), encoding for the capsid protein, and partial sequence of ORF1b (346 nt), encoding for the viral polymerase, identified the viruses as member of the family Astroviridae. The phylogenetic analysis clearly clustered canine astroviruses in the genus Mamastrovirus. Relative closest similarities were revealed with a cluster comprising human, porcine and feline astroviruses, based on the ORF2 sequences available. Based on the species definition for astroviruses and on the data obtained in this study, we suggest a new species of astrovirus -canine astrovirus, CaAstV -to be included in the genus Mamastrovirus.",

To date, astrovirus-like particles have been reported only three times in dogs (Marshall et al., 1984a; Vieler and Herbst, 1995; Williams, 1980) . However, the previous studies observations were based on electron microscopy only and their presence in canine faeces had never been confirmed by genetic or antigenic analysis. It is noteworthy that electron microscopy often leads to wrong classification of small viral particles since they share similar morphological and physiochemical features (Guy et al., 2004) . In the above-mentioned reports, astroviruses were detected in symptomatic puppies, associated with other enteric viruses such as parvoviruses, rotaviruses and coronaviruses.",

In humans, these viruses are considered one of the most common causes of diarrhoea in children (Walter and Mitchell, 2003) . Very recently, astrovirus detection rates up to 100% have been reported in insectivorous bats in Hong Kong (Chu et al., 2008) . On the contrary, in other species such as dogs or cats, their detection appears very sporadic. Whether this is due to a true lower prevalence or to the fact that they are simply under-detected remains questionable and further analysis should be conducted to increase our understanding of the epidemiology of this infection in domestic carnivores.",

None of the possible start codons for the capsid precursor were in an optimal context for translation initiation as proposed by Kozak (1989) , as they both lack a purine at position-3, but the most upstream codon did have a context most resembling the consensus vertebrate sequence around start codons GCCRCCAUGG (Kozak, 1989) . The canine astrovirus genome, however, displayed the very conserved region right upstream of the Mamastrovirus-homologous start codon, that could be involved in subgenomic RNA transcription (Jonassen et al., 2003) , and it is therefore not clear if a subgenomic RNA spanning the first initiation codon is synthesised. However, the fact that a functional domain could be predicted for the additional N-terminal peptide could suggest that longer transcripts actually are translated. The role of the transmembrane domain and membrane localisation of the resulting protein would still need to be elucidated.",
