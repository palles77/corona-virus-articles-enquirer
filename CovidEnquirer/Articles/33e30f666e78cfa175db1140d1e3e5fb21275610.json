The characteristics of a replicon-based DNA vaccine like, self-amplification of transcripts and induction of apoptosis were analyzed in transfected mammalian cells. When the pAlpha-CPV-VP2 was injected intradermal as DNA-launched repliconbased DNA vaccine in dogs, it induced CPV-specific humoral and cell mediated immune responses. The virus neutralization antibody and lymphocyte proliferative responses were higher than conventional CPV DNA vaccine and commercial CPV vaccine. These results indicated that DNA-launched repliconbased CPV DNA vaccine was effective in inducing both CPV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and can be considered as effective alternative to conventional CPV DNA vaccine and commercial CPV vaccine.",

CPV, a strain evolved from feline parvovirus occurs as three different mutated forms, namely, CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c. The disease caused by this virus is considered as most threatening to puppies between the time of weaning and 6 months of age. In young and adult dogs, it causes a severe acute leukopenia and enteritis leading to death by dehydration and shock in a large proportion of cases (Carmichael, 2005) . With severe disease, dogs can die within 48-72 h without treatment. CPV spreads from dog to dog by direct or indirect contact with feces (Parrish, 1990) .",

The killed vaccine requires high dose of antigen per immunization and adjuvant while, MLV could be excreted post-vaccination and not recommended during pregnancy. Furthermore, newborns are generally considered unsuitable vaccine recipients due to passive transfer of maternal antibodies leading to antigen clearances and immaturity of their immune system. To overcome these problems, attempts were made to develop new CPV vaccines including, a recombinant vaccine utilizing a baculovirus expression system and a synthetic peptide vaccine (Turiso et al., 1992; Casal et al., 1995) . DNA vaccination against CPV has also been investigated with several advantages over conventional CPV vaccines including, eliminating the use of adjuvant and effective in presence of maternal derived antibodies (MDA) in age at which the animal is supposed to be immune (Jiang et al., 1998; Tarpey and Greenwood, 2001; Gupta et al., 2005; Patial et al., 2007; Patel and Heldens, 2009) .",

            "text": "Although DNA immunization has several advantages but there are few limitations, namely, DNA vaccination can induce long-term uncontrolled expression of a transgene, possibility of integration into the host genome and possible induction of anti-DNA antibodies (MacGregor et al., 1998; Martin et al., 1999; Beger et al., 2002) . Further, enhancing DNA vaccine immunogenicity remains a challenge in large animals (MacGregor et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2000; Babiuk et al., 2003) . To increase antigen production and immunogenicity with DNA vaccines, a new strategy has been developed to express the target heterologous antigen under the control of replicon from positive-strand RNA viruses with the promise of using the ability of these viruses to produce large amounts of viral proteins in infected cells. In addition, exclusive cytoplasmic replication of replicon RNA and inability of the replicon RNA to escape from the transfected cell makes the vector biologically safe (Berglund et al., 1999; Leitner et al., 2000a; Lundstrom, 2000) . RNA replicon-based expression vectors have been developed from representatives of most of the positive-strand RNA virus families, namely, Togaviridae, Flaviviridae and Picornaviridae. Several members of Alphavirus genus of Togaviridae family, including, Sindbis virus (Xiong et al., 1989; Herweijer et al., 1995; Hariharan et al., 1998; Miller et al., 2008; Saxena et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2009 ), Semliki Forest virus (Liljestrom and Garoff, 1991; Berglund et al., 1999; Zhao et al., 2009) , Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (Davis et al., 1989; Lee et al., 2003) and Flavivirus genus, including, tickborne encephalitis virus, Kunjin virus (Anraku et al., 2002 (Anraku et al., , 2008 , Pestivirus-BVDV and Coronavirus-HCoV (Curtis et al., 2002) have received considerable attention. These demonstrated that RNA replicon-based DNA vaccines provide higher levels of protective immunity and break immunological tolerance by activating innate dsRNA-mediated anti-viral pathways (Frolov and Schlesinger, 1994; Diebold et al., 2009 ) and significant dose-sparing advantages compared with conventional DNA vaccines (Miller et al., 2008; Leitner et al., 2003) .",

This transcribed RNA is transported to cytoplasm and translated into replicase protein. The expressed replicase protein catalyzed the synthesis of negative-sense transcripts to act as template for further self-amplification of RNA transcripts and transcription of CPV-VP2 mRNA using 26S subgenomic promoter.

The deletion of 3 0 UTR has made the plasmid non-replicating as the 3 0 UTR of positive sense RNA virus has been reported as essential element for initiation of anti-sense RNA template and replication (Richard and Charles, 2005; James et al., 2007) . There were over 24 thousand times more CPV-VP2 mRNA transcripts in pAlpha-CPV-VP2-transfected BHK-21 cells compared to respective non-replicating control indicating the self-replicating ability of replicon-based CPV-VP2 DNA vaccine. Another characteristic of a replicon-based DNA vaccine, induction of apoptosis was also analyzed in pAlpha-CPV-VP2-transfected cells. To detect induction of apoptosis with replicon-based CPV DNA vaccine specific to replication of the replicon, apoptotic cell death was analyzed in both pAlpha-CPV-VP2-and empty vector (pAlpha)-transfected cells and compared with pTargeT-CPV-VP2transfected cells. The induction of apoptosis was detected only in replicon-based CPV DNA vaccine and pAlpha vector as confirmed by Annexin V and TUNEL assays. The induction of apoptosis due to formation of double-stranded RNA intermediates produced by alphaviral replicase during RNA replication (Leitner et al., 2000b; Glasgow et al., 1997) and subsequent activation of dsRNA-dependent pathways (PKR and 2 0 -5 0 -A synthetase/RNase L) provided a mechanistic explanation for the observation that every cell transfected in vitro with replicon-based DNA or RNA undergoes apoptosis (Leitner et al., 2003) . In addition, induction of apoptosis also confers potential immune-potentiating effects and increased safety for the clinical use of DNA vaccines (Ljungberg et al., 2007) .",

The replicon-based CPV DNA vaccine induced dsRNA-mediated apoptotic cell death which makes this vaccine approach effective and biologically safe compared to conventional DNA vaccine.
