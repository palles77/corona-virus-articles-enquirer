Currently, methods such as real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (realtime RT-PCR) have not yet been developed for the rapid detection and quantitation of bovine (BToV) and porcine (PToV) toroviruses. Using BToV and PToV RNA standards generated by in vitro transcription, the detection limit of the SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay was 2.54 \u00d7 10 2 BToV and 2.17 \u00d7 10 3 PToV copies/reaction (correlation coefficiency = 0.99 and 0.97, respectively), whereas those of RT-PCR and nested PCR were 2.54 \u00d7 10 5 and 2.54 \u00d7 10 4 (BToV) and 2.17 \u00d7 10 7 and 2.17 \u00d7 10 5 (PToV) cRNA viral copies/reaction, respectively. Archived diarrhea specimens of calves (n = 121) and piglets (n = 86) were subjected to RT-PCR, nested PCR and SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. By conventional RT-PCR, 1 (0.8%) bovine and 7 (8.1%) porcine samples tested positive to BToV and PToV, respectively. With nested PCR, 13 (10.7%) bovine and 17 (19.8%) porcine samples tested positive. SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR assay detected BToV and PToV in 22 of 121 (18.2%) bovine and 31 of 86 (36.0%) porcine samples. These results indicate that SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR (P < 0.05) is a more sensitive assay, which can be reproduced as a reliable, sensitive, and rapid tool for the detection and quantitation of toroviruses.",

Toroviruses infect both animals and humans and are associated predominantly with enteric diseases (Koopmans and Horzinek, 1994) . The first report of ToVs described the identification of the Berne virus in 1972 from a rectal swab of a horse with diarrhea in Berne, Switzerland (Weiss et al., 1983) . A decade later, a virus that was related morphologically and antigenically to the Berne virus, which was designated the Breda virus (BToV) and Breda virus-like particles, was described in the stools of neonatal calves and children (Beards et al., 1984; Woode et al., 1982) . A porcine torovirus (PToV) has been identified and characterized in the feces of swine (Kroneman et al., 1998) . Toroviruses have been established as infectious gastrointestinal agents in cat-tle and as a predominant cause of acute enteric infections in piglets (Ito et al., 2007; Kroneman et al., 1998) . Significantly, zoonosis was possibly implicated when ToV-like particles detected in patients with gastroenteritis exhibited similar morphology and cross-reacted with BToV, which supports the need for continuous monitoring of potential zoonotic infection with ToVs (Hoet and Saif, 2004) .",

Real-time RT-PCR is a more recent method that is more sensitive than EM and conventional RT-PCR for quantitating virus load, pathogenesis studies and identification of virus latency (Glass et al., 2000; Park et al., 2009 ). Real-time RT-PCR is relatively easy to perform and has a high-throughput capacity as reported with other viruses using SYBR Green chemistry and/or the TaqMan assay (Chun et al., 2010; Park et al., 2009) . As far as we know, there is only one report describing the use of real-time RT-PCR for the detection of PToV (Pignatelli et al., 2010) . There is no report of the use of real-time RT-PCR for BToV.

The primer pair for the SYBR Greenbased real-time RT-PCR assay was designed to target sequences centered on the conserved M gene. The conserved stretches in a portion of the M gene have shown high homology among the published BToV and PToV isolates and, with the nucleocapsid gene, was thought to be the most sensitive and specific detection genes for both viruses in fecal samples (Ito et al., 2007; Pignatelli et al., 2009) . Using both target genes, the detection of BToV or PToV by real-time RT-PCR was demonstrated to be specific and sensitive in this study and in another study (Pignatelli et al., 2010) . The findings of the present study proved the application and efficiency of using one primer pair for the detection of two viruses. However, the results showed a higher analytical sensitivity of BToVs over PToVs. The detection of a larger amplicon size that was >70 bp (187 bp), and the positive weaker amplicons in the case of PToVs could have possibly affected the melt rate and phenomenon of dye translocation, which consequently affected SYBR Green binding and detection (Varga and James, 2006) .",

The M gene region has different GC/AT ratios in BToV and PToV. Accordingly, the functions of the GC/AT ratio, length and sequence can be demonstrated by melting curve analysis and can be used to differentiate amplification products with <2 \u2022 C intervals in melting temperature (Ririe et al., 1997) . Melting curve analysis of the in vitro transcripts showed a difference of only 1 \u2022 C between BToV and PToV, and, using the field samples, melting curve analysis showed overlapping temperature ranges for BToV (74.7-79.7 \u2022 C) and PToV (73.9-78.1 \u2022 C). From this, it can be inferred that the differentiation between BToV and PToV by the cur-rent real-time RT-PCR assay becomes more difficult to determine and insignificant. Nonetheless, the desired products can be distinguished from undesirable products, and in many cases the need for gel electrophoresis is eliminated (Ririe et al., 1997) . The samples that showed close melting temperature with the no-template control were reconsidered positive as they showed a good level of viral copies and a clear band after electrophoresis. In this study, all of the real-time RT-PCR samples tested were verified by electrophoresis and sequencing.",

At present, the SYBR Green RT-PCR assay is 1000 and 10,000 times more sensitive than BToV and PToV detection by conventional RT-PCR, respectively, and 100 times more sensitive than nested PCR for both viruses when using cRNA. Therefore, the one-step SYBR Green quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay is significantly superior (P < 0.05) to the other PCR assays in terms of sensitivity, specificity and quantitative linearity. The short amplicons in the real-time PCR assays used in this study likely resulted in more efficient amplification and higher analytical sensitivity. Despite the shorter amplicon size in PToV nested PCR, the real-time PCR reproduced amplicons with greater analytical sensitivity. Taken together, these observations indicate that the SYBR Green-based RT-PCR assay is a useful and reliable method for the detection of BToV and PToV.",
