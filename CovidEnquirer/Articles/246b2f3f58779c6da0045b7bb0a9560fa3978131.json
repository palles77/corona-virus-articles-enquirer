No specific drug is currently available for the effective treatment of CSFV infection; however, RNA interference (RNAi) has been applied successfully to inhibit the replication of human and other animal viruses. In this study, three effective siRNAs targeting NS3 of CSFV were selected. siNS3-2 targeting NS3 gene was chosen for further experimentation, while siN1 and siN2 targeting N pro gene, and siNS5B targeting NS5B gene describe previously. Single, double and quadruple anti-CSFV siRNA expression plasmids, with loxp sites at each end of the selectable marker genes, were constructed and analyzed using the same promoters or four different promoters, targeting N pro , NS3 and NS5B genes of CSFV. Results indicate that single or multiple siRNA expression plasmids can efficiently inhibit CSFV replication and that inhibition was markedly stronger when multiple siRNAs were expressed targeting different genes of CSFV. Since RNAi applied to anti-CSFV research, this study provides anti-CSFV methods by single and multiple siRNA expression which can target most viral isolates of different subtypes and prevent viral escape. It also provides a basis for development of CSFV-resistant transgenic pigs.",

CSF causes great economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. The disease was first recognized in China in the 1920s and there continue to be major epizootics in this country (Tu et al., 2001; Zhu et al., 2009) . CSFV belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. Its genome consists of a single-stranded (+) sense RNA of about 12.5 kb with a single large open reading frame (ORF), encoding a polyprotein of approximately 3400 amino acids. After translation, the polyprotein is cleaved into viral structural and non-structural peptides which are, from N-to C-terminus, N pro -C-E ms -E1-E2-P7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B. N pro is essential for evading the cellular antiviral defense system, and protects cells from double-stranded RNA-induced apoptosis (Ruggli et al., 2005) . The NS3 serine protease cleaves at downstream cleavage sites (Tautz et al., 1997; Tautz et al., 2000) and additionally possesses helicase and NTPase activities essential for viral RNA replication (Gu et al., 2000; Moulin et al., 2007) . NS5B, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is responsible for viral RNA replication (Zhang et al., 2005) .",

One problem is that siRNA cannot entirely inhibit CSFV replication. This has been suggested to be due to loss of siRNA activity caused by point mutation or deletion of the siRNA target site (Konishi et al., 2006; Westerhout et al., 2005) . In this study, single, double, and quadruple anti-CSFV siRNA expression plasmids, with loxp sites at both ends of the selectable marker gene, were constructed and analyzed using the same promoters or four different promoters. Four different siRNA expressing from four different promoters can avoid recombination . Results show that CSFV inhibition was markedly stronger when multiple siRNAs were expressed targeting different genes of CSFV, and that siRNA target region mutation is not a major reason why CSFV replication cannot be completely blocked by RNAi.

Previous studies have performed an analysis of a multiple siRNA expression strategy in which three or four siRNAs were expressed from the same promoters and found that this caused frequent recombinations at repeat sequences of the expression cassette, resulting in deletion of one or two cassettes . To prevent recombination, therefore, we selected four different promoters lacking sequence similarity for the four siRNA expression strategy. Human polymerase III promoters H1, U6 and 7SK and the murine polymerase III promoter U6 were selected because they have well defined transcription start and termination sites. Cloning the target sequences upstream of a reporter gene is a simple and convenient method for examining whether siRNA transcription occurs from multiple expression plasmids. Fig. 3 shows that each siRNA expression cassette was active, confirming that multiple siRNA expression from these promoters is a valid approach.",

This observation is consistent with a previous report that multiple siRNAs targeting the same mRNA results in enhanced gene silencing (Ji et al., 2003) . Reduction in viral genome copy number and viable virus production at 48 and 72 h post-CSFV infection from multiple siRNA expression indicates that the effect of inhibition of CSFV replication is additive and maintained. This cumulative effect may restrict optimal shRNA processing by limiting the cellular components of the RNAi machinery (Castanotto et al., 2007) , which might explain why each siRNA expression level from the siRNA4 was reduced compared to the single siRNA expression vector, as measured by Northern blot (ter Brake et al., 2008). Viral replication is not completely blocked by the combined expression of multiple siRNAs. This is not surprising since RNAi does not target the incoming genome. Virus replication may still occur, therefore, albeit at a very low level, perhaps slowly accumulating until a certain threshold is reached.",

Li et al. (2009b) created an EGFP reporter transgenic pig by applying the Cre/Loxp recombinase system. If the anti-CSFV activity of RNAi were to be combined with the technology of producing a transgenic pig, the result could be a pig resistant to CSFV infection. This is the reason why we constructed single and multiple anti-CSFV siRNA expression plasmids with loxp sites at each end of the selectable marker genes which Genome copy numbers are the means of three experiments. The viral genome copy numbers per nanogram of total RNA from siC-transfected cells, calculated from the standard curve, were 1.55 \u00c2 10 5 /ng and 2.11 \u00c2 10 5 /ng at 48 and 72 h post-CSFV infection, respectively.
