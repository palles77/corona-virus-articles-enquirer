This study demonstrates that glial cells derived from neural progenitor cells are susceptible to JHMV infection and that treatment of infected cells with IFN-\u03b3 inhibits viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Although type I IFN production is muted in JHMV-infected glial cultures, IFN-\u03b2 is produced following IFN-\u03b3-treatment of JHMVinfected cells. Also, direct treatment of infected glial cultures with recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 inhibits viral replication. IFN-\u03b3-mediated control of JHMV replication is dampened in glial cultures derived from the neural progenitor cells of type I receptor knock-out mice. These data indicate that JHMV is capable of infecting glial cells generated from neural progenitor cells and that IFN-\u03b3-mediated control of viral replication is dependent, in part, on type I IFN secretion.",

The resulting infection is characterized by widespread viral replication in astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes with relatively few infected neurons Knobler et al., 1981; Parra et al., 1999; Perlmane et al., 1999) . JHMV infection of the CNS induces localized expression of pro-inflammatory factors that precedes and accompanies the activation and recruitment of immune cells into the CNS. During the acute disease phase, infiltrating virus-specific CD8 + T cells control viral replication by two different effector mechanisms: IFN-\u03b3 secretion controls viral replication in oligodendrocytes, while a perforin-dependent mechanism promotes viral clearance from astrocytes and microglia (Lin et al., 1997; Parra et al., 1999) . While a robust and effective cell-mediated immune response is generated in response to JHMV infection, virus persists within the CNS and is associated with the development of an immune-mediated demyelinating disease similar to the human demyelinating disease MS. During this stage, both T cells and macrophages are important in amplifying disease severity by contributing to myelin damage (Cheever et al., 1949; Perlman et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "While implantation of myelin-competent cells has shown to be effective in promoting remyelination in animal models of demyelination initiated by either infiltration of autoreactive lymphocytes or injury, there is limited information available with regards to the ability of these cells to enhance demyelination resulting from viral infection. We believe this is an important and clinically relevant question as the etiology of MS remains enigmatic although viruses have long been considered potential triggering agents for initiating disease (Gilden, 2005; Olson et al., 2005) . Therefore, evaluating potential cellreplacement strategies for inducing remyelination in viral models of neurologic disease may yield insight into whether this method of (Totoiu et al., 2004) . Moreover, remyelination was not associated with dampened T cell infiltration into the CNS as has recently been reported following NSC transplantation in mice with EAE (Aharonowiz et al., 2008; Einstein et al., 2006; Hardison et al., 2006) . Having demonstrated that engraftment of glial cells promotes remyelination following JHMV-induced demyelination, we next were interested in addressing several interrelated issues including i) if glial cells derived from neural precursor cells were susceptible to infection and ii) how infection may be controlled within this population of cells. We believe these are relevant questions within the context of studying animal models of viral-induced demyelination as cells are being transplanted into the CNS in which a persistent virus is present. Therefore, analyzing the susceptibility of cellular progeny derived from neural precursor cells to viral infection is important in that these cells may represent important viral reservoirs in the face of persistent infection. Understanding consequences of infection and how replication may be controlled within these cells will provide insight into understanding host defense mechanisms of implanted cells as well as potential relevance to disease outcome. The relevance of this is further highlighted by the fact that while previous studies have demonstrated that JHMV is able to infect and replicate within glial cells (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Lavi et al., 1987; Rempel et al., 2005) , the fate of neural progenitor cells as well as cells derived from this population to viral infection is not well characterized.",

The pretreatment of cultures with IFN-\u03b3 (100 U/ml) resulted in a significant (p b 0.05) reduction in viral titers at 24 h p.i. when compared to cultures incubated with IFN-\u03b3 following infection (Fig. 3C ).

Moreover, in vivo astrocytes have been shown to express CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA transcripts during the acute response to JHMV infection and in vitro cultured astrocytes are capable of expressing CXCL10 mRNA transcripts (Lane et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2000 Liu et al., , 2001 . Neither CXCL9 nor CXCL10 are detectable in differentiated neural progenitor cultures in response to JHMV infection at 12 or 24 h p.i. (Figs. 4A and B) . In contrast, IFN-\u03b3 treatment of infected cultures resulted in measurable levels of both CXCL9 and CXCL10 at 12 and 24 h p.i. (Figs. 4A and B) . Levels of CXCL10 were dramatically higher (\u223c 45,000 pg/ml at 12 h) compared to CXCL9 levels (\u223c75 pg/ml at 12 h) suggesting differential promoter sensitivities to IFN-\u03b3 treatment or altered stability at either RNA or protein levels. To assess the importance of IFN-\u03b3-mediated production of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in the inhibition of JHMV replication, neural progenitor cells were isolated from CXCL10\u2212/\u2212 mice and mice deficient in the signaling receptor for CXCL9 and CXCL10, CXCR3 (CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice). The neural progenitor cells from deficient mice were differentiated in vitro, infected with JHMV and treated with IFN-\u03b3. As we observed in wildtype mice, such treatment resulted in a significant reduction in viral titers at 24 h p.i. compared to infected cells incubated with medium alone (Figs. 4C and D). Therefore, the IFN-\u03b3-mediated anti-viral effect observed occurs independently of either production of CXCL9, and CXCL10 or CXCR3 signaling.",

As shown in Fig. 5A , JHMV infection did not result in detectable levels of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 at either 24 or 48 h p.i. However, IFN-\u03b3 treatment of JHMV-infected cultures resulted in expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 that was elevated compared to treatment with IFN-\u03b3 alone (Fig. 5A) . Further, direct treatment with either recombinant mouse IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 of JHMV-infected cultures resulted in a dramatic reduction in viral replication compared to media treatment (Fig. 5B) . IFN-\u03b2 exhibited \u223c 90% greater reduction in viral replication compared to IFN-\u03b1 treatment indicating a more potent antiviral activity associated with IFN-\u03b2 signaling (Fig. 5B) . Next, progenitor derived glial cultures were generated from type I IFN receptor-deficient mice (IFN-R\u2212/\u2212) mice and treated with IFN-\u03b3 following JHMV infection. As shown in Fig. 5C , such treatment did result in a reduction in viral replication (p b 0.05) compared to media-treated controls by 48 h p.i. However, viral replication was reduced, on average, by only 53% in IFN-R\u2212/\u2212 cells compared to N90% reduction in wildtype cells (Figs. 3A and C). Therefore, these data indicate that the IFN-\u03b3-mediated antiviral effect is diminished in the absence of type I IFN signaling indicating that one mechanism by which IFN-\u03b3 promotes control of JHMV replication within glial-derived progenitors is through induction of type I IFN.",

            "text": "The findings put forth in this paper provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that JHMV is capable of infecting and replicating within primary cultures of glia derived from neural progenitor cells. These findings are distinct from earlier studies (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1982; Lavi et al., 1987; Rempel et al., 2005) showing that primary neural cultures are susceptible to viral infection, as we have allowed for differentiation of glial cells from neural progenitor cells into defined glia populations. In addition, we have demonstrated that IFN\u03b3 treatment of JHMV-infected cultures suppresses JHMV replication and this is dependent, in part, on secretion of IFN-I. The importance of IFN-I in defense following viral infection of the CNS has been documented in several animal models. Infection of mice in which IFN-I is genetically silenced or signaling blocked results in uncontrolled proliferation of West Nile virus (Samuel and Diamond, 2005) , Sindbis virus (Burdeinick-Kerr et al., 2007; Byrnes et al., 2000) , and Semliki forest virus (Fragkoudis et al., 2007) . The cellular source of IFN-I production is controlled by viral tropism and the model system employed. For example, neurons are a primary source of IFN-I in response to West Nile virus infection and these cells also represent a prominent cellular target for viral infection and replication (Samuel and Diamond, 2005) . Similarly, robust cytokine production, including IFN-\u03b2, is observed following infection of astrocyte cultures with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) (Palma et al., 2003) . In the case of JHMV infection, emerging evidence highlights the importance of IFN-I in protection of the CNS in response to infection. Bergmann and colleagues (Ireland et al., 2008) recently demonstrated increased mortality correlating with wide-spread JHMV dissemination throughout the parenchyma including expanded cell tropism with neurons infected in mice deficient in IFN-I receptor (IFNR\u2212/\u2212). Additional support for an important role for IFN-I in host defense in response to infection with mouse coronaviruses are derived from studies that demonstrate increased disease severity following anti-IFN antibody treatment (Lavi and Wang, 1995) and enhanced resistance following treatment with recombinant IFN-\u03b2 (Matsuyama et al., 2000; Smith et al, 1987) .",

(2007) indicating that peripheral infection with a hepatotropic strain of MHV (MHV-A59) results in increased IFN-I production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. While it is clear that IFN-I is produced in vivo in response to mouse coronavirus infection and participates in effective host defense, the molecular signals regulating expression on a cellular basis are less well characterized. Indeed, IFN-\u03b2 is not produced in response to JHMV infection of fibroblasts but this is not dependent on the absence of intracellular double-stranded RNA or deficiencies in IFN-\u03b2 signaling (Roth-Cross et al., 2007) . Impaired IFN-\u03b2 production within JHMVinfected cultures correlated with impaired translocation of transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 into the nucleus of infection cells (Versteeg et al., 2007; Zhou and Perlman, 2007) . In addition, it may be possible that double-stranded RNA generated during the course of JHMV infection is not accessible to cellular pattern recognition receptors (PPR) such as RIG-I, Mda-5, and TLR-3 (Zhou and Perlman, 2007) . While the molecular mechanisms associated with inhibited IFN-\u03b2 production have not been completely defined, the MHV nucleocapsid protein has been suggested to be an IFN-I antagonist (Ye et al., 2007) .",

In addition, secretion of CXCL9 and CXCL10 was also impaired following JHMV infection of differentiated progenitor cultures and this is in contrast to previous findings indicating robust chemokine expression following infection of primary cultures of astrocytes. These results support the earlier hypothesis that within certain host cell populations, double-stranded RNA generated during the course of JHMV replication may not be accessible to PPR and this impacts secretion of IFN-I and non-ELR chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. Moreover, since the majority of progenitor cells (\u223c70-80%) differentiate into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC), it is possible that oligodendrocytes are unable to synthesize either CXCL9 or CXCL10 in response to JHMV infection.",

Additionally, these data support and extend studies by Stohlman and colleagues (Gonzalez et al., 2005 Parra et al., 1999) that have demonstrated IFN-\u03b3 is critical in controlling JHMV replication in oligodendrocytes in vivo. Infection of IFN-\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice with JHMV highlighted a critical role for this cytokine in controlling viral replication within oligodendrocytes (Parra et al., 1999) . Additionally, transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative IFN-\u03b3-receptor specifically on oligodendroglia demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 is required for inhibiting viral replication (Gonzalez et al., 2005 . The findings put forth in the present study clearly indicate that IFN-\u03b3 suppresses JHMV replication in glial-committed progenitor cells derived from neural precursors. Moreover, the IFN-\u03b3-mediated antiviral effect is not dependent on secretion of CXCR3-binding chemokines. Although the in vivo mechanism(s) by which IFN-\u03b3 evokes an antiviral response have not yet been defined, our data suggest that production of IFN-I by IFN-\u03b3treated glia may contribute to viral control. Further support for type I IFN in controlling JHMV replication within oligodendrocyteenriched cultures is provided by the demonstration that treatment of JHMV-infected oligodendrocytes with either recombinant IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 resulted in N1 log decrease in viral titers with IFN-\u03b2 having a much greater anti-viral effect compared to IFN-\u03b1 in controlling replication.",

For example, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) is capable of infecting and replicating within the human oligodendrocytes and suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating diseases (Dietrich et al., 2004; Mock et al., 2006) . HHV6 infection of human OPC cultures results in formation of multinucleated syncytia and elevated expression of GalC (Dietrich et al., 2004) . OPC proliferation was also impaired in HHV6-infected cultures and infected cells and suggests that infection in vivo may have longlasting effects on precursor cell properties. These findings are interesting in that remyelination is relatively slow in JHMV-infected mice yet OPC are present within and surrounding areas of on-going demyelination. This suggests that the ability of OPC to successfully remyelinate axons is impaired and/or an environment that is conducive for promoting remyelination is not available. Having demonstrated that JHMV is capable of infecting and replicating within primary cultures of OPC indicates that these cells are susceptible to infection in vivo. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that early infection of neural progenitor cells impacts either generation of OPC and/or the ability of OPC to successfully remyelinate demyelinated axons at later stages of infection. We are currently addressing these possibilities.",
