The ovarian tumor (OTU) domain represents a superfamily of predicted proteases found in eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral proteins, some of which have Ub-deconjugating activity. We show that the OTU domain-containing proteases from nairoviruses and arteriviruses, two unrelated groups of RNA viruses, hydrolyze Ub and ISG15 from cellular target proteins. This broad activity contrasts with the target specificity of known mammalian OTU domain-containing proteins. Expression of a viral OTU domain-containing protein antagonizes the antiviral effects of ISG15 and enhances susceptibility to Sindbis virus infection in vivo. We also show that viral OTU domain-containing proteases inhibit NF-kB-dependent signaling. Thus, the deconjugating activity of viral OTU proteases represents a unique viral strategy to inhibit Ub-and ISG15dependent antiviral pathways.",

In par-ticular, viruses must overcome the potent antiviral and inflammatory effects of innate immune cytokines such as type I interferon (IFNab) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa). The induction and activity of these antiviral cytokines is controlled by, among other factors, Ub and Ublike (UBL) molecules (Kirkin and Dikic, 2007) . The activation of the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) by TNFa was one of the first immune regulatory pathways found to be dependent on protein ubiquitination (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000) . NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells through binding to IkB. TNFa binding to its receptor induces IkB phosphorylation followed by K 48 -linked poly-ubiquitination targeting IkB for proteasomal degradation. This releases NF-kB dimers for translocation to the nucleus, where they regulate transcription. NF-kB-induced genes include type I IFN and other cytokines, hence this Ub-controlled pathway plays a vital role in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as in inflammation (Tergaonkar, 2006) . In addition to ubiquitination of IkB, K 63and K 48 -linked ubiquitination regulates other molecules involved in this signaling pathway (Chen, 2005) .",

Deubiquitinating (DUB) proteolytic enzymes are also involved in processing of Ub precursors. Five classes of DUBs have been described (Nijman et al., 2005) ; one of the most recently identified is the ovarian tumor (OTU) domain family. This family comprises a group of putative cysteine proteases, homologous to the OTU protein in Drosophila, and includes more than a hundred proteins from eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses (Makarova et al., 2000) . Several OTU domain-containing mammalian proteins, such as Cezanne (Evans et al., 2003) , Otubain 1 and 2 (Balakirev et al., 2003) , and A20 (Evans et al., 2004) have been identified as proteases that participate in substrate-specific deubiquitinating processes. For example, A20 is an important downregulator of TNFa signaling via its deubiquitination of TRAF6 and its dual function of poly-Ub 63 deconjugation followed by poly-Ub 48 modification of RIP (Wertz et al., 2004) . These activities are mediated by its N-terminal OTU domain and its C-terminal zinc finger domain, respectively. However, the substrate specificity and physiologic role of most OTU domaincontaining proteins remains unknown.",

We found that two unrelated families of RNA viruses express OTU domain-containing proteases with the capacity to decrease Ub and ISG15 conjugation. Nairoviruses are negative-sense, segmented, RNA viruses of the Bunyaviridae family. Their large (L) protein contains an OTU domain and an RNA polymerase domain, placing this protein in the growing category of multifunctional viral proteins. Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a human nairovirus that causes hemorrhagic fever with up to 30% mortality (Whitehouse, 2004) . Arteriviruses, including equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV), are the causative agents of important diseases in horses and pigs. They are positive-sense, nonsegmented RNA viruses that contain an OTU domain within their nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2), which is also involved in viral replicase polyprotein processing (Snijder et al., 1995) . We found that these viral OTU domains, in contrast to known mammalian OTU proteases, display a broad deconjugating activity toward ubiquitinated and ISGylated products and consequently inhibit innate immunity pathways that are dependent on Ub and ISG15. Thus, the deconjugating activity of viral OTU domains represents a unique strategy used by nairoviruses and arteriviruses to evade the host antiviral response, probably by targeting a common biochemical structure in Ub and the UBL protein ISG15.",

Transfection of cells with plasmids expressing CCHFV-L slightly decreased the overall expression of Ub-conjugated proteins ( Figure 2B , lanes 1 and 2, panel A; Figure 2C , lanes 1, 4, and 5, panel A). To test the effect of CCHFV-L expression on protein ISGylation, ISG15 conjugates were generated by transfecting plasmids expressing ISG15 and its specific E1 (UBE1L) (Yuan and Krug, 2001) and E2 (UbcM8) (Kim et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004) enzymes, since endogenous levels of ISGylated proteins are low in the absence of IFN stimulation. Cotransfection of CCHFV-L resulted in a clear decrease in the level of ISGylated proteins ( Figure 2B , lanes 1 and 2, panel B; Figure 2C , lanes 1, 4, and 5, panel B). This decrease was also observed when CCHFV-L was untagged (data not shown). The decrease in total ISGylation was comparable to the effect of UBP43, a known ISG15 deconjugating enzyme ( Figure 2B , lane 9, panel B). Expression of CCHFV-L did not affect levels of expression of UBE1L or UbcM8 ( Figure 2B , lane 2, panels C and D; Figure 2C , lanes 4 and 5, panel C), consistent with CCHFV-L acting via inhibition of ubiquitination and ISGylation reactions or by directly deubiquitinating or deISGylating proteins.",

Recombinant L(1-169) cleaved both K 48 -and K 63linked poly-Ub chains into monomers ( Figure 3B , lanes 2 to 5), similarly to isopeptidase T, a known DUB enzyme ( Figure 3B , lane 10). This activity was markedly decreased by mutating the amino acid C 40 ( Figure 3B , lanes 6 to 9), indicating that this residue is required for optimal protease activity. The small amount of deconjugation observed with L(1-169)1A is not unexpected, as mutation of Cezanne's catalytic cysteine yielded similar data where most, but not all, catalytic activity was impaired (Evans et al., 2003) . This result shows that the OTU domain of CCHFV-L has bona fide DUB activity in the absence of other cellular proteins.",

For this, we generated cell lysates from IFNb-treated Ubp43 \u00c0/\u00c0 murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are rich in ISG15 conjugates (Malakhov et al., 2003) . Incubation of these lysates with recombinant L(1-169) protein, but not L(1-169)1A, appreciably decreased ISGylated proteins ( Figure 3C , top panel) in a L(1-169) concentration-dependent manner. This result suggests that the CCHFV OTU domain has C 40 -dependent ISG15 deconjugating activity but does not exclude the possibility that the protease activity of the viral OTU domain was activating another deISGylating enzyme present in cell lysates. To address this possibility, we enriched 6xHisISG15 conjugates using affinity chromatography. Incubation of ISG15 conjugates with increasing amounts of L(1-169) resulted in ISG15 deconjugation ( Figure 3C , lanes 2 to 5, bottom panel). No deconjugation was detected with the mutant L(1-169)1A protein ( Figure 3C , lanes 6 to 9, bottom panel). In addition, L(1-169) processed a pro-ISG15 protein into its mature form ( Figure 3E , lane 2, panel A). These data suggest that the CCHFV-L OTU domain directly deconjugates IS-Gylated proteins through its predicted cysteine protease activity.",

The arterivirus nsp2 cysteine protease cleaves the nsp2/nsp3 site within the large viral polyprotein during replicase maturation. In the case of EAV, this process is known to be mediated by the 166 N-terminal residues of nsp2, which contains the OTU domain (Snijder et al., 1995) . In our study, a slightly larger N-terminal EAV-nsp2 domain (175 amino acids; nsp2N) was used in addition to the fulllength protein. The OTU domain of the L protein of DUGV, a nairovirus related to CCHFV, as well as EAV-nsp2, EAV-nsp2N, and PRRSV-nsp2, decreased Ub and ISG15 conjugates when expressed in 293T cells ( Figure 4A , lanes 3-6), indicating that deconjugation may be an immune evasion strategy shared by diverse viral families.",

In contrast, only overexpression of Otubain 1 and Cezanne moderately decreased cellular global Ub conjugate levels, while expression of A20 or Otubain 2 had no effect on total levels of ubiquitinated proteins (Balakirev et al., 2003; Evans et al., 2003 Evans et al., , 2004 . To date, there have been no published studies investigating the effects of these proteins on ISG15 conjugates. We therefore tested Otubain 1, Otubain 2, Cezanne, VCIP135, and A20 for their ability to decrease overall protein ubiquitination and ISGylation in transfected cells ( Figure 4B ). Expression of Otubain 1 resulted in a significant decrease in Ub conjugate levels, while Otubain 2 and Cezanne had a lesser effect ( Figure 4B , lanes 2-4, panel 1). Consistent with their specificity for particular ubiquitinated substrates, expression of VCIP135 and A20 did not result in a decrease in overall ubiquitination. None of the OTU-containing mammalian proteins tested decreased global levels of ISG15 conjugates ( Figure 4B, lanes 2-6, panel 2) . Similar results were obtained when truncation mutants expressing the OTU domains of Otubain 1, Otubain 2, Cezanne, and A20 were tested (data not shown). In addition, the OTUcontaining catalytic domain of A20 (A20 CD ) was unable to process either ISG15 or Nedd8 ( Figure 3E , lane 4, panels A and B), even though it cleaved K 48 -linked Ub chains ( Figure 3F, lane 4) . By contrast, overexpression of the mammalian deISGylating enzyme UBP43 decreased overall levels of ISG15 conjugates but not Ub conjugates ( Figure 4B, lane 7) . Thus, viral OTU proteases appear to be unique in their ability to target both ISG15 and Ub conjugates.",

We next evaluated the sensitivity of L(1-1325) transgenic mice to infection with the virulent Sindbis virus strain AR86, an alphavirus that causes lethal encephalitis in young mice and is sensitive to ISG15-mediated antiviral effects . Susceptibility to Sindbis virus infection tracked with expression of the L(1-1325) protein ( Figure 5C ). Thirty-five percent of mice from the 1836 transgenic line survived infection compared to R80% survival in C57/BL6 littermate controls or transgenic mice expressing low or undetectable levels of transgene-encoded protein.

Infection with 169GG or 169, but not MTGG or MT, reduced the amount of Ub conjugates detected in cells ( Figure 6B , right panel), indicating that the viral OTU domain functions as a DUB enzyme when expressed from a Sindbis virus. Following transfection with ISG15 and its E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, ISGylated proteins can be detected in BHK-21 cells ( Figure 6B , lane 1, middle panel). Infection with 169GG or 169 greatly reduced ISG15 conjugates, confirming that OTU expression results in deconjugation of ISGylated proteins. When cells were transfected with the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes but not ISG15, ISG15 conjugates were observed only following MTGG infection ( Figure 6B , left panel). This shows that ISG15 expressed from dsTE12Q is capable of ISGylating proteins in the presence of the relevant conjugating enzymes but that this is only seen in the presence of a catalytically inactive form of the coexpressed L(1-169) protein ( Figure 6B, lane 3, left panel) .",

In order to exclude effects due to IFNab-stimulated genes other than ISG15, we infected IFNabR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 6C ). Seventy percent of mice infected with a virus expressing ISG15 and the mutant OTU domain (MTGG) survived, consistent with previous observations that expression of ISG15 protects mice from lethality following Sindbis virus infection . In contrast, only 20% of mice infected with a virus expressing ISG15 and a functional OTU domain (169GG) survived infection (p = 0.0015). These data also correlate with our in vitro data demonstrating that L(1-169), but not L(1-169)2A, can deISGylate proteins following infection ( Figure 6B ). Mice infected with 169 or MT died with similar kinetics, demonstrating that the expression of L(1-169) did not increase the virulence of dsTE12Q in the absence of the IFN-mediated antiviral response. The slight increase in survival between 169GG and 169 (p < 0.0001) or MT (p = 0.0032) suggests that expression of the CCHFV OTU domain cannot completely antagonize the effects of ISG15 in this system. Nevertheless, these data show that expression of a catalytically active viral OTU domain can antagonize the antiviral effects of ISG15 in vivo.",

To address this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of the CCHFV-L and EAV-nsp2 OTU domains on the NF-kB signaling pathway. Expression of the OTU domains of CCHFV-L and of EAV-nsp2 decreased in a dose-dependent manner the activation of an NF-kBresponsive promoter (Fujita et al., 1992) after TNFa treatment. This inhibition was similar to that mediated by A20, an OTU domain-containing inhibitor of the NF-kB pathway ( Figure 7A) . Inhibition was about 10-fold greater in the presence of the L(1-169) domain than the L(1-169)2A mutant, indicating a role for the OTU domain protease activity. These results were further confirmed by the ability of CCHFV-L(1-169) to inhibit NF-kB activation as measured by the inhibition of endogenous p65 nuclear translocation upon TNFa treatment ( Figures 7B and 7C) . The slight inhibition of NF-kB activation by the L(1-169)2A protein could be caused by some residual binding of this mutant to ubiquitinated substrates or by the presence of some other regulatory motifs within this protein. Nevertheless, the p65 nuclear translocation inhibition by the L(1-169) protein was significantly higher when compared to its mutant counterpart (p = 0.0044). Overall, these results demonstrate the ability of viral OTU domains to affect immune pathways that are regulated by ubiquitination.",

Inhibition of protein ubiquitination might also affect other cellular processes that can be subverted by viruses for their own advantage, such as the proteasome-mediated protein degradation system, multiple signal transduction events, or cell cycle progression.

Thus, it is not surprising that viruses may use multiple strategies to counter the antiviral effects of ISG15. The work presented here provides a viral strategy for decreasing expression of bona fide ISG15 conjugates in cells. The first such strategy reported is the direct association of the NS1 protein of influenza B virus with ISG15. This association inhibits protein ISGylation by blocking the ISG15-UBE1L interaction ( and Krug, 2001) , while the viral OTU domain proteases analyzed here accomplish a similar effect via deconjugation.",

This raises the interesting possibility that sequences similar to the LRLRGG motif may play an important role in substrate recognition and specific cleavage by CCHFV-L OTU and perhaps other viral proteases. Interestingly, the nsp2 of arteriviruses cleaves the nsp2/3 junction at FRLIGG (EAV) or GRLLGG (PRSSV) (Allende et al., 1999; Snijder et al., 1996; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) , sequences similar to the LRLRGG motif. Thus, arterivirus OTU proteases have dual functions: performing essential viral polyprotein processing and targeting host substrates to modulate the antiviral response. This is analogous to the hepatitis C virus NS3-4A protease, which is involved both in viral polyprotein processing and in cleaving the cellular antiviral proteins TRIF and IPS-1 Lin et al., 2006) .",

We were limited in performing the obvious experiment of assessing the role of viral OTU domain protease activity during infection by two things. First, CCHFV is a biosafety level 4 pathogen lacking a good animal model and whose molecular biology is not well enough developed to allow generation of mutant viruses. Second, the viral OTU domain proteases evaluated here either have, or are likely to have, important effects on processing of viral polyproteins (see above). Given this, we felt that it would be difficult to prove that these proteases have effects during infection that are solely attributable to their DUB and deISGylating activities. However, in transgenic mice, recombinant chimeric Sindbis viruses, and transfected cells, we found that viral OTU domain-containing proteases have significant effects on Ub-and ISG15-dependent host processes of known importance for innate immunity. We therefore conclude that these proteins have bona fide immune evasion properties.

To further map this region, truncation mutants of the L protein expressing only the first 354, L(1-354), or 169 amino acids, L(1-169), were tested. The results indicated that the region responsible for the decreased levels of Ub and ISG15 conjugates mapped to the OTU domain, L-(1-169) (Figure 2B, lanes 6 and 7, panels A and B; Figure 2C, lane 2, panels A and B).
