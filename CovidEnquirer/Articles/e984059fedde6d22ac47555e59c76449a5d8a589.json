            "text": "protein of the inner nuclear membrane. It is synthesized without a cleavable amino-terminal signal sequence and composed of a nucleoplasmic aminoterminal domain of 204 amino acids followed by a hydrophobic domain with eight putative transmembrane segments. To identify a nuclear envelope targeting signal, we have examined the cellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy of chicken LBR, its amino-terminal domain and chimeric proteins transiently expressed in transfected COS-7. Full-length LBR was targeted to the nuclear envelope. The aminoterminal domain, without any transmembrane segments, was transported to the nucleus but excluded from the nucleolus. When the amino-terminal domain of LBR was fused to the amino-terminal side of a transmembrane segment of a type II integral membrane protein of the ER/plasma membrane, the chimeric protein was targeted to the nuclear envelope, likely the inner nuclear membrane. When the aminoterminal domain was deleted from LBR and replaced by ot-globin, the chimeric protein was retained in the ER. These findings demonstrate that the aminoterminal domain of LBR is targeted to the nucleus after synthesis in the cytoplasm and that this polypeptide can function as a nuclear envelope targeting signal when located at the amino terminus of a type II integral membrane protein synthesized on the ER. T HE topology of integral membrane proteins synthesized on the ER is established by signal and stop transfer sequences that determine which domains traverse aqueous pores in the ER membrane and which domains remain localiT~d in the membrane (Blobel, 1980; Simon and Blobel, 1991) . Some of these proteins contain specific sequences that confer retention in the ER (Paabo et al., 1987; Nilsson et al., 1989; Jackson et ai., 1990) . Others are targeted to the cis-C-olgi network by ER-derived membrane vesicles, and some of these integral membrane proteins contain sequences that confer retention in the Golgi membranes (lVlachamer and Rose, 1987; Nilsson et al., 1991; Wong et al., 1992) . Most integral membrane proteins that reach the Golgi complex are sorted into different populations of membrane vesicles that emerge from the TGN to become secretory storage vesicles or to fuse with lysosomes or the plasma membrane (Grifiiths and Simons, 1986; Klausner, 1989; Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Rothman and Orci, 1992) . In epithelial cells, additional sorting mechanisms are operative that target protein-containing membrane vesicles to either the apical or basolateral membranes (Rodriguez-Boulan and Nelson, 1989) .",

Proteins of the outer nuclear membrane are shared with the continuous ER membrane (Amar-Costesec et al., 1974) and outer nuclear membrane proteins have not been identified that are not also found in the ER.

Rabbit antibodies against chicken hepatic lectin were a gift from Dr. K. Drickamer and have been previously described (Loeb and Drickamer, 1987) . Antibodies that recognize the amino-terminal domain of chicken LBR were made against a synthetic polypeptide of sequence S-P-K-Q-R-K-S-Q-S-S-S-S-S (The Rockefeller University/Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer Facility, New York, NY). The polypeptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA) by previously described methods (Muller et al., 1982) . The conjugate was injected into rabbits to produce polyelonal antibodies as described (Posnett et al., 1988) . Anti-LBR antibodies were purified from rabbit serum by affinity chromatography against the synthetic polypeptide coupled to Affi-Gel (Bio Rad Labs, Hercules, CA). Coupling using EDAC reagent was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Affinity chromatography was performed as described elsewhere (Harlow and Lane, 1988) . Anti-LBR antibodies were characterized by immunoblotting of proteins of chicken erythrocyte nuclear envelopes, rat liver nuclear envelopes and COS-7 cell lysates. Chicken erythrocyte nuclear envelopes were prepared as described for turkey erythrocytes (Worman et al., 1988) and rat liver nuclear envelopes were also prepared by methods used previously (Courvalin et al., 1990) . COS-'/cell lysates were made by scraping cells offpetri dishes and immediately boiling them in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) . SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (1970) . References for immunoblotting can be found elsewhere (Courvalin et al., 1990) .",

A diffuse fluorescence labeling of the entire nucleus, similar to that seen with the DNA-binding dye DAPI, was observed. The fluorescence intensity of the nucleolus was relatively decreased indicating that the polypeptide is excluded from this organelle. After transfection and growth in culture for up to 72 h, only nuclear fluorescence was observed without significant cytoplasmic labeling or disruption of nuclear architecture.

COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmid LMBR-CHL that codes for a chimeric protein containing the amino-terminal domain of LBR fused to the amino-terminal side of the transmembrane segment of chicken hepatic lectin. In cells transfected with this plasmid, nuclear rim fluorescence without ER labeling was observed consistent with an inner nuclear membrane localization (Fig. 5 a) . No appreciable ER fluorescence was observed even 72 h after transfection. Hence, the amino-terminal domain of LBR can function as a nuclear envelope targeting signal and direct an integral membrane protein synthesized on the ER to the inner nuclear membrane. To confirm this hypothesis, the majority of the aminoterminal domain was deleted from full-length LBR and replaced by c~-globin. The expressed chimeric protein was detected in the ER and nuclear envelope of transfected cells (Fig. 5 b) . An exclusive fluorescence labeling of the nuclear envelope, which was seen with LBR and the LBR-chicken hepatic lectin chimeric protein, was never observed even when cells were examined only 12 h after transfection. Fluorescence labeling of the ER and nuclear envelope does not exclude the possibility that some of the expressed protein is in the inner nuclear membrane or nuclear pore membranes; however, a large portion of the ot-globin-LBR chimeric protein is retained in the ER. Therefore, even if some of the ex- Figure 5 . The amino-terminal domain of LBR is a nuclear envelope targeting signal for integral membrane proteins.

LBR is synthesized without a cleavable amino-terminal signal sequence and therefore the amino-terminal domain likely faces the cytoplasm when synthesized on the ER membrane. With this topology, the first putative transmembrane domain would function as both an uncleaved signal sequence and a stop transfer sequence (Blobel, 1980) . Hence, LBR is synthesized on the ER membrane with a topology analogous to type II integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane. This topology of LBR is supported by the finding that a residue in its amino-terminal domain is phosphorylated in vivo by p34 '~c2 protein kinase (Courvalin et al., 1992) , an enzyme that is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm and not likely the ER lumen or the perinuclear space. When reaching the inner nuclear membrane, the amino-terminal domain of LBR would have a nucleoplasmic orientation like the amino termini of type II plasma membrane proteins have a cytoplasmic orientation. As LBR amino-terminal domain can reach the nucleus after synthesis in the cytoplasm, cytoplasmically exposed amino-terminal domain should also be able to reach the nucleus by the same mechanism when attached to transmembrane segments in the ER membrane. The nuclear translocation of LBR amino-terminal domain would then \"drag\" the transmembrane segments of the protein that remain embedded in the proteolipid bilayer to the inner nuclear membrane. The ultrastructure of the nuclear pore complex would have to be such that there is no steric hindrance and that membrane-embedded proteins can freely diffuse in the pore membrane domain.",

Many nuclear proteins contain short stretches of basic amino acids called nuclear localization signals (NLS's) that are responsible for nuclear transport (Garcia-Bustos et al., 1991) . NLS's can direct transport to the nucleus when fused to normally cytoplasmic proteins (Goldfarb et al., 1986) . Most NLS's are similar to the sequence P-K-K-K-R-K-V found in SV-40 large T antigen (Kalderon et al., 1984) . Cytosolic and pore complex proteins that bind to these NLS's target proteins to the nuclear pores and facilitate transport into the nucleus (Silver, 1991; Adam and Gerace, 1991; Moore and Blobel, 1992) . Proteins that contain SV40-type NLS's transported to the nucleus by this mechanism may first be concentrated in the nucleolus after passing through the pores (Breeuwer and Goldfarb, 1990; Meier and Blobel, 1990; Moore and Blobel, 1992 ) and recent evidence has shown that an NLS binding protein may shuttle between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm (Meier and Blobel, 1992) . The LBR amino-terminal domain does not contain a stretch of amino acids similar to the \"classical\" NLS of SV-40 large T antigen, and the finding that the polypeptide is excluded from the nucleolus also suggests that its nuclear transport does not involve proteins that shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleolus. It would also be unlikely that translocation to the nucleolus could be achieved for intact LBR where most of the protein would be embedded in the nuclear envelope membranes.",

As fluorescent-labeled dextrans with molecular masses <60 kD can passively diffuse through the nuclear pore complexes (Paine et al., 1975) , the LBR amino-terminal domain is small enough (~22.5 kD) to enter the nucleus by diffusion. If LBR amino-terminal polypeptide can diffuse through the nuclear pores, its concentration in the nucleus may result from its ability to bind to nuclear components. In vitro experiments have shown that LBR binds to lamin B (Worman et al., 1988) , and it is possible that the lamin B binding domain of the protein is in the nucleoplasmic amino terminus. If the free amino-terminal domain were binding only to lamin B in vivo, a nuclear rim fluorescence pattern would be expected on immunofluorescence microscopy. The diffuse localization in the nucleus observed when free aminoterminal domain is expressed in transfected cells argues against lamin B binding being solely responsible for nuclear accumulation of this polypeptide. Therefore, in the nucleus in vivo, the LBR amino-terminal polypeptide may bind to other nuclear components in addition to lamin B. The aminoterminal domain of LBR also possesses characteristics of a chromatin binding protein (Worman et al., 1990) including a basic pI and three S/T-P-X-X motifs that have the capacity to bind to DNA (Suzuki et al., 1989) . The diffuse staining of the nucleus in immunofluorescence microscopy suggests that the LBR amino-terminal domain may bind to chromatin and that this binding, in addition to lamin B binding, may be responsible for its concentration in the nucleus. When embedded in the ER membrane via a transmembrane segment after synthesis, the cytoplasmically exposed aminoterminal domain of LBR may cause the protein to diffuse through the interconnected proteolipid bilayers of the ER, outer nuclear and nuclear pore membranes to reach the inner nuclear membrane where the exposed amino terminus can bind to intranuclear components such as chromatin or lamin B.",

            "text": "In summary, the amino-terminal domain of the inner nuclear membrane LBR can function as a nuclear envelope targeting signal and can direct a type II integral membrane protein synthesized on the ER to the nuclear envelope, likely the inner nuclear membrane. The targeting polypeptide may be accumulated in the nucleus either by active transport used by proteins that contain nucleoplasmin-like bipartite NLS's or by diffusion and ligand binding. Future experiments examining the details of lamin B binding, chromatin binding, and in vitro transport of the LBR amino-terminal domain will help further elucidate the mechanism of how this polypeptide functions as a nuclear envelope targeting signal.",
