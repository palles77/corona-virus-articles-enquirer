On March 29, 2003, only one month after the discovery, Dr. Urbani died from the disease, largely because of his belief that it is a doctor's duty to \"stay close to the victims.\" His wife, Giuliani, mother of three, challenged her husband on the point; Dr. Urbani replied, \"If I can't work in such situations, what am I here for?\" With the question of avian epidemics (indeed pandemics) looming ahead, we might well consider the extent of risk that is incumbent in the physician's role when facing such contagious populations. While the level of risk embraced by Dr. Urbani far exceeds what I believe should be expected, I will show, nonetheless, there is a general duty to treat at a professionally appropriate level of risk grounded in natural moral obligations and the medical profession's reciprocal standing as a public trust.",

The present essay borrows substantially from that argument, but it will be argued further that the duty not only enlists fiduciary and contractual features of a professional public trust, but there are natural aspects of the obligation to assist that bind us all. The claim will be that our natural obligations are elevated if there are enhanced capacities to render aid, particularly in times of critical need.",

Indeed, when faced with contagious populations, many famous physicians, including Galen, fled for their lives. Hence, the declaration made by the AMA, in 1847, was at once dramatic and professionally defining.

[5] It is interesting to note that after 1957, the language of personal risk disappears from the AMA Code without argument or explanation. [6] Huber and Wynia argue that since the language of accepting personal risk was largely crafted as a response to the threat of pestilence, it disappeared thus, because the threat no longer seemed to be a serious danger. What happened, they write, was that \"by the 1950s, the era of massive epidemics was perceived to be ending in America.\" [7] They further note that statements on epidemics were quietly withdrawn in 1977 as \"irrelevant 'historical anachronisms'\" [8] .",

[9] The key portion of the Declaration reads as follows: \" We, the members of the world community of physicians, solemnly commit ourselves to: 4. Apply our knowledge and skills when needed, though doing so may put us at risk.\" [10] The crucial years for the duty to treat at personal risk arose thus after AMA's proclamation of 1847.

[11] In this book, Starr refers to the medical profession in the United States as the \"sovereign profession\" and ultimately locates the key to the profession's transformation in its acquisition of social authority. While the most influential single explanation for the ascendancy of American medicine can be found with the rise of medical science, Starr is quick to qualify this by noting that if it was science alone, things easily might have gone in another direction. Indeed, rather than elevating medicine into professional sovereignty, \"[t]he growth of science might have reduced professional autonomy by making doctors dependent upon organizations.\" [12] For the profession to succeed in the way it has, the profession has had to persuade the public not only that it has the scientifically grounded capacity and competence to address the concerns of patients and the public, but that it will faithfully address those concerns -as a fiduciaryin recognition of the reciprocal terms of a public trust. This fiduciary posture at once distances the profession from the norms of free market competition, and its reigning ethos of caveat emptor, and also spikes the view that the medical profession simply functions as a monopolistic power elite that has self-servingly driven its way into social control.

[13] Accordingly, the accomplishment of the medical profession required having established itself publicly as the unchallenged authority for medical matters and as the institution most willing and capable of deploying those skills. Crucially, the notion of \"authority\" that Starr considers flows from its \"classical sense\" as that which \"signifies the possession of some status, quality, or claim that compels trust or obedience.\" [14] Starr furthers the point noting that doctors, as professionals, \"...claim authority, not as individuals, but as members of a community that has objectively validated its competence.\" [15] Since I have used the AMA's Code of Ethics as part of the literature providing strong notice of a duty to treat a personal risk, it might be well to mention some prominent confusions that have arisen in the interpretation of the AMA Code.

That is, by taking a narrow interpretation of \"emergencies\" (e.g., bystander cases, emergency room duty), some might think the autonomy rights of AMA physicians actually trump broader public service duties. Such a reading, on its face, seems well out of keeping with the broader spirit of the AMA Code. However, the narrow focus does speak to a libertarian strain that should be give us pause. The narrow construal of \"emergencies\" must be seen as defensible in some legitimate form if the libertarian interpretation is to sustain itself.

Second, if they do, does that involve an obligation to assist, even at a physician's peril? As to the first question, the logic of the principles requires an answer in the affirmative. In an essay from 1996, I took this question to task and concluded that as a matter of logical consistency, the narrow construal can not be sustained. \u2026 if we have included an independent reference to societal obligations and allowed that except in emergencies (narrowly construed) such obligations may be overruled in any case, then in principle, we have allowed physician autonomy to overrule in every case. However, this would render the societal pro-vision altogether pointless. \u2026 it appears that the narrow construal of emergency would arbitrarily foreclose on the responsibility to society clause. Thus, a close reading of the AMA document reveals a derivable, although indirect constraint on physician autonomy for at least some societal emergencies. [17] While it might be objected that even under this interpretation a particular physician's autonomy remains free and unconstrained in selecting which societal duties are to be undertaken, it should be understood, nonetheless, that such a consideration arises secondary to the more general principle -of the interpretation -that some societal duties must trump physicians' autonomy rights, Principle VI terminology notwithstanding. Once it is allowed that broader societal emergencies sometimes trump physicians' autonomy rights, the question shifts from \"whether or not\" to questions of \"when and to what extent.\" This analysis leaves the position regarding public service and service at risk as an open question not to be foreclosed even by the narrow reading of Principle VI.",

He writes, \"[w]e must believe that there are some limits, however vaguely specified, to the risks physicians have agreed to face.\" [23] Daniels then constructs a basic argument for the duty to treat in terms of what he calls a middle ground or a \"modified AMA position.\" Generally speaking, his argument runs as follows: Since physicians have consented to some (vaguely defined) standard of risk when they enter the profession, if the circumstances (HIV, bioterrorism, etc.) fall under that standard of risk, then there is a duty to treat even at personal risk if the risks fall within that standard. The point of this argument, while it might seem vague, actually aims to settle one point with finality: Namely, is there such a duty or no?",

That public information and understanding of the physician's role is readily available is evident in the long list of medical programs stretching back to Doctor Kildare, Marcus Welby, and Ben Casey. More recently, shows such as M*A*S*H, General Hospital, ER, Chicago Hope, Grey's Anatomy, House, and Scrubs have also focused their gaze on various dimensions of the role of doctoring. I take it as uncontroversial, thus, that there is abundant public information regarding the physician's role. The dedication and sacrifice suffered by physicians for the sake of their patients is always a thematic undertone, whether the protagonist lives up to the standard or not, and whether or not such is the explicit subject of the particular episode or show. While Daniels appears to rely on this kind of general understanding of the physician's role, he draws back from endorsing the extreme language of the 1847 code that indicates physicians should accept risks up to and including the risk of their own lives. Certainly, the idea of physicians risking their lives as a moral duty is aimed much too high to be realistic and, consequently, some discussion of what is meant by acceptable risk is needed.",

Yet as with other public service professions, including the fire and police forces, risk has traditionally been part of medical care ...\" [24] While Daniels' argument makes a strong conceptual point, it lacks certain moral and applied considerations that are needed if our goal is to affect behavior and policy. This essay aims at provoking such policy ambitions. As to the moral side of the issue, what is absent in the consent argument is the covenantal character of the medical role. The idea of a covenant harbors greater moral weight than does consent or contract. Consent and contract are well captured by our sense of \"rational agreement,\" but one can consent and contract quite rationally where one does not promise (e.g., think of consenting to work for low wages due to lack of options). Normally, in promising, we do more than agree to follow a certain course of action; we commit ourselves rather to the rightness of that course. This promissory quality of the medical role can be seen distinctly in that most well recognized feature of the medical profession: the publicly sworn oath of service to patient care.",

Following this conception of applied ethical analysis, a general standard for rendering aid at personal risk will be articulated. The standard will focus on a conception of a \"reasonable physician.\" This reasonable physician standard has the practical value of being analogous to the \"reasonable person\" standard used regularly in tort law as a guide for the jury in determination of the facts regarding cases of alleged negligence.
