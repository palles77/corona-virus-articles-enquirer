To examine the role of other host factors in MHV infection in mice, IFN-g-deficient mice with a BALB/c background (BALB-GKO) were infected intraperitoneally with MHV and compared with B6-GKO mice. In contrast to B6-GKO mice, BALB-GKO mice died within 1 week due to acute hepatic failure. The viral titer of the liver in BALB-GKO mice was significantly higher than that in B6-GKO mice. All hepatocytes in BALB-GKO mice were necrotic at 5 days post-infection, which was clearly distinct from large but limited lesion in the liver from infected B6-GKO mice. The serum alanine aminotransferase activity of infected BALB-GKO mice were higher than that of B6-GKO mice and was paralleled with the severity of the pathological changes and viral titers in infected mice. Administration of exogenous IFN-g to BALB-GKO partially inhibited the acute death. These results indicate that BALB-GKO and B6-GKO mice clearly show different diseases following MHV infection, although wild type counterparts of both mice apparently showed the same clinical course after MHV infection.",

Due to frequent outbreaks of murine coronavirus infection in laboratory animal facilities, the viruses are detested as the most detrimental infectious agent for laboratory mice. On the other hand, experimental murine coronavirus infections provide useful animal models of human diseases. In particular, murine coronavirus-induced demyelination is utilized in investigating the pathogenesis of demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis in humans (Liu et al., 2000; Marten et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2000) . We previously reported a reduced viral clearance and a resultant systemic persistent infection associated with disseminated granulomatous serositis in IFN-g-deficient C57BL/6 (B6-GKO) mice after intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection with murine coronavirus, strain JHM (JHMV) (Kyuwa et al., 1998) . The disease bears a resemblance to feline infectious peritonitis, another coronavirus-induced fatal disease in cats. The same disease was also observed in naturally infected B6 mice deficient in IFN-g (France et al., 1999) as well as IFN-g, IL-10 double knockout mice (Boivin and Smith, 1998) . This experimental infection may provide a unique model to examine the pathological mechanism of virus-induced peritonitis.",

The essentially same phenomenon was observed in mice with a BALB/c background. The viral titers of BALB-GKO mice were 20-and 6-fold higher than those of heterozygous mice at 3 and 5 days post-infection, respectively. However, it is worth noting that values of a BALB/c background were greater than those of a B6 background. For example, the viral titer of BALB-GKO mice at 5 days post-infection was significantly higher than that of B6-GKO mice. served in heterozygous or wild type mice with the same background and administration of exogenous IFN-g into BALB-GKO mice, in part, protected the virus-induced acute death. These results suggest that IFN-g play an essential role in protecting mice with a BALB/c background from JHMV infection. The disease, however, was noticeably distinct from subacute granulomatous peritonitis in IFN-g-deficient mice with a B6 background that we reported previously (Kyuwa et al., 1998) . Whereas hepatitis was observed in B6-GKO mice in the acute phase, it was not progressing and had been almost cured in the subacute phase when granulomatous peritonitis was evident (Kyuwa et al., 1998) . This result was unexpected, because wild type mice with both genetic backgrounds are resistant to i.p. infection with JHMV (Kyuwa et al., 1988 (Kyuwa et al., , 1996 Stohlman et al., 1992) and both strains have the same genotype of MHV receptor (Ceacam1) that is believed to be important in determining mouse susceptibility (Ohtsuka and Taguchi, 1997) . Taken together, the data presented here suggest that genetic factor(s) other than IFN-g or MHV receptor affect MHV infection in mice.",

On the other hand, it has been reported that some gene-knockout mice show no typical phenotype due to being compensated by other genes, which have the same function to the gene disrupted (Doetschman, 1999) . The gene-knockout technology thus, not only offers a good opportunity to see the function of the gene in vivo, it sometimes show us the existence of other gene(s) involved in the phenomenon of interest.",
