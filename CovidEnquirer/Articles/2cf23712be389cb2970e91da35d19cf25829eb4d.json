            "text": "The re-emerging porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) variant related diarrhea has been documented in China since late 2010 and now with global distribution. Currently, a virulent PEDV CH/YNKM-8/2013 and a CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M have been successfully isolated from the clinical samples. To dissect out the underlying pathogenic mechanism of virulent PEDV and clarify the differences between virulent and CV777 vaccine strainlike PEDV infections, we performed an iTRAQ-based comparative quantitative proteomic study of Vero cells infected with both PEDV strains. A total of 661 and 474 differentially expressed proteins were identified upon virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like isolates infection, respectively. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was employed to investigate the canonical pathways and functional networks involved in both PEDV infections. Comprehensive studies have revealed that the PEDV virulent strain suppressed protein synthesis of Vero cells through down-regulating mTOR as well as its downstream targets 4EBP1 and p70S6K activities, which were validated by immunoblotting. In addition, the virulent strain could activate NF-\u03baB pathway more intensively than the CV777 vaccine strain-like isolate, and elicit stronger inflammatory cascades as well. These data might provide new insights for elucidating the specific pathogenesis of PEDV infection, and pave the way for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Biological significance: Porcine epidemic diarrhea is now worldwide distributed and causing huge economic losses to swine industry. The immunomodulation and pathogenesis between PEDV and host, as well as the difference between virulent and attenuated strains of PEDV infections are still largely unknown. In this study, we presented for the first application of proteomic analysis to compare whole cellular protein alterations induced by virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infections, which might contribute to understand the pathogenesis of PEDV and anti-viral strategy development.",

            "text": "Until now, reports about the interaction between PEDV and host interactions are rarely covered. It is well known that Vero cells are most commonly used not only for PEDV isolation, propagation and basic research, but also for many different human pathogens, including SARS-CoV [23] , influenza virus [24] , and respiratory syncytial virus [25] . Vero cells are interferon-deficient when infected by viruses while they still have the interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor, permitting productive growth of pathogens and reducing bystander effect in uninfected cells [16] . Although this may limit the comprehensive understanding of innate immune responses of virus-infected Vero cells, a map of Vero cell proteome is tremendously valuable. Recently, the protein changes of Vero cells contributing to a virulent PEDV variant and a classic PEDV strain CV777 were investigated, respectively [26, 27] . However, comparative proteomic analysis focused on PEDV strains with different virulence under the same circumstances has not been reported. In this study, we employed a quantitative proteomic analysis based on iTRAQ coupled with LC-MS/MS, to capture the differential protein expression profiles of Vero cells upon infection with virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV strains. These differentially expressed proteins were classified into many signaling pathways, and interacting networks involved in PEDV infection were also constructed. Importantly, we noticed that the virulent PEDV strain could suppress protein synthesis of infected Vero cells through mTOR and its downstream targets inactivation. Moreover, the virulent strain could induce stronger inflammatory responses than the CV777 vaccine strain-like strain. Overall, this is the first report on comparison of whole cellular protein alterations induced by virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like strains of PEDV by application of iTRAQ based proteomic analysis, which might accelerate our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in different PEDV infections.",

According to the PEDV growth curve in Vero cells, we obtained that both of these two strains peaked at 48 h pi, and then gradually declined (SI Fig. 1 (B) and (C)). In addition, we also noticed that the cellular cytoskeleton of these two strains was severely collapsed at 48 h pi as a result of obvious CPE. The result of IFA indicated that PEDV began to replicate at 12 h pi, and most of the cells were infected at 36 h pi (Fig. 1B) .

            "text": "The host protein synthesis machinery can be subverted by viruses to synthesize viral proteins and stifle host innate defense to facilitate its propagation [30] . One important finding in this study was that virulent PEDV infection suppressed ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) phosphorylation through mTOR complex inactivation. Similarly, eIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2) signaling was also dramatically inhibited during virulent PEDV infection, which was documented to be advantageous for some virus propagation Each experiment was repeated three times, and here are the representative results. [31] [32] [33] . Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key downstream effector of PI3K/AKT pathway, is commonly targeted by viral proteins for its central role in protein synthesis and cell growth with two different complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) [34, 35] . mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70S6K and 4EBP1, which enhance mRNA and cap-dependent translation, respectively [30, 36] . mTOR signaling was manipulated by many viruses to achieve high protein levels for both host and virus itself. For example, to facilitate viral protein synthesis, HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) simultaneously activated mTORC1 and eIF4E through inactivation of 4EBP1 [37] . By upregulating AKT level, human papillomavirus (HPV) activated mTORC1 which might be required for the initiation of viral replication [38] . Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [39] , human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [40] , and vaccinia virus (VacV) [41] all augmented the content of mTOR following by 4EBP1 phosphorylation, thus promoting viral protein synthesis and viral replication.",

            "text": "In contrast, some viruses suppressed host translation machinery by down-regulated mTOR activity to contribute to cell cytopathology and apoptosis. Encephalomyocarditis virus [42] , vesicular stomatitis virus [43] , or adenovirus [44] infection restrained the cap-dependent translation by promoting the 4EBP1 hypophosphorylation. Influenza virus infection was also reported to decrease the abundance of phosphorylated eIF4E, which might assist to inhibit host translation [45] . Treated with rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, the PRRSV titer was dramatically enhanced in host cells than the mock-treated [46] . In our study, the mTOR signaling and its downstream targets of 4EBP1 and p70 S6K were remarkably down-regulated in virulent PEDV CH/ YNKM-8/2013 than that by the CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M strain. It was noteworthy that the content of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) was reduced in virulent PEDV infection, while increased in CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infection, which closely associate with the differences in mTOR signaling of Vero cells infected with these two strains. Particularly worth mentioning was that the virulent strain exhibited higher amount of viral protein and nucleic acids production compared to CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M at the time-point tested. One possible explanation was that virulent PEDV subverted the translation apparatus of Vero cells to combat against innate antiviral responses for higher virus yield, resulting in earlier evident cytopathic effect and ultimately cell death. Besides, the difference in protein synthesis induced by the two viruses might be related with their different pathogenic mechanism in Vero cells. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway was intimately linked with cellular autophagy, which acted pivotal functions in viral replication and pathogenesis [47, 48] . The elaborate mechanism between autophagy and PEDV pathogenesis is currently under investigation in our laboratory.",

            "text": "During infection, the viruses initiate various strategies to suppress host immune system and many antiviral responses are conversely generated by host cells. The balance between host and virus confrontation determines the outcome of viral infection and disease progression [49] . The cell-mediated immune responses and inflammatory pathways remain poorly understood to PEDV infection, much less about the differences between virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M strains. Previous studies have shown that PEDV infection could cause deficiency in the synthesis of type I interferon (IFN), and nucleocapsid (N) and papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) proteins functioned as IFN antagonist in vitro [50, 51] . Xu et al. reported that E and N proteins could activate NF-\u03baB and aggrandize interleukin-8 expression using a porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) line [52, 53] . Whereas it was also noticed that transient expression of N protein in HEK-293T cells could inhibit NF-\u03baB signaling [50] . Besides, the recent report revealed that PEDV infection induced NF-\u03baB activation through the TLR2, TLR3, and TLR9 pathways in porcine intestinal epithelial cells [54] . In our study, many immune regulatory pathways described above were constructed based on the differentially expressed proteins using IPA tool. To further investigate the differences regarding immunomodulation manipulated by virulent or CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infection, we examined the expression of specific inflammatory cytokines which were hallmarks of immune responses by real-time RT-PCR. It was noted that the expression of inflammatory cytokines detected were sharply up-regulated during virulent PEDV infection. As is well accepted that NF-\u03baB acts at the crossroads of many signaling pathways, exerts central roles in regulation of the immune responses and cell survival/ proliferation [55] . Immunoblotting analysis indicated NF-\u03baB pathway was more significantly activated after virulent PEDV infection through p65 phosphorylation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, while moderately activated after CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M strain infection. Activation of NF-\u03baB can facilitate replication of some viruses, such as TGEV and PRRSV [56, 57] . Yamamoto et al. noticed that inappropriate or overactivation of NF-\u03baB could lead to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [58] . Here, the more dramatically activation of NF-\u03baB signaling in virulent PEDV strain infected cells might be due to the characteristics of virulence and pathogenicity, as well as stronger replication capability and infectivity of virulent strain than that by the CV777 vaccine strain-like strain, followed by more severe inflammatory cascades to aggravate Vero cells destruction. PEDV infection is marked by acute enteritis with mortality approaching 100% in sucking piglets up to one week of age, especially for virulent strain. We speculated that the acute enteritis caused by virulent PEDV might be associated with the excessive inflammatory cascades responses, which lead to devastating damage of epithelial cells in small intestine of the piglets.",

The phosphorylation and translocation of STAT1 lead to the transcription of interferon stimulated genes that provide an antiviral state for the host cells [59, 60] . It was reported that animals with STAT1 disruption were extremely susceptible to viral disease [61] . Robert J. et al. reported the mouse model deficient in STAT1 possessed an increased viral titer, lung pathology and susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection over the wild type mouse [59] . Our proteomic data showed that the STAT1 displayed no obvious change during CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infection, but notably decreased with 2-fold ratio in virulent PEDV infection, which was confirmed by western blot. STAT3, another important STAT family member, regulates cell proliferation, survival and anti-apoptosis process [62] . Moreover, the activation of STAT3 was closely associated with virus replication [63, 64] . In this study, STAT3 protein was found with up-regulation in both virulent (6.51-fold change) and CV777 vaccine strain-like (4.27-fold change) PEDV infected cells, which might facilitate cell survival and virus propagation. Take all these observations into account, the virulent PEDV might try to manipulate infected cells to sustain cell survival for maximizing viral replication and titers, coupled with cytopathologic changes and finally lead to dramatically pathological changes in host cells.",

            "text": "The GTPase family which contains three subfamilies, Rho, Rac and Cdc42, regulates various biological processes including the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton, vesicle trafficking, cell adhension and apoptosis [65] . It is well recognized that re-configuration of cytoskeleton is closely related with transcellular membrane trafficking and therefore facilitates viral replication [66] . Cytoskeletal changes have also been detected in proteomic studies of virus infections, such as infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) [67] , TGEV [20] , and PCV2 [68] . Our proteomic study showed that the Rac and Rho signaling were significantly changed after virulent PEDV infection. Detailed analysis demonstrated that the alteration was caused by the differential expression of the key upstream regulator PI3K upon virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infection. In addition, integrin (another key upstream regulator), ARP2/3 (an initiation complex of actin polymerization), IQGAP and CYFIP1 which also played important roles in GTPase family, were all dramatically down-regulated in virulent PEDV infection. We inferred that virulent PEDV might manipulate these differentially displayed proteins to generate actin cytoskeleton networks collapse and cell-cell detachment in host cells, leading to an unstable cytoskeletal structure. The cytoskeletal disruption may contribute to virus multiplication and dissemination by facilitating its release and entry, conferring higher virus titer and infectivity to virulent strain. While no such obvious alterations were confirmed in CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M infected cells, this might be resulted from the less severe cell pathological changes due to the lower viral titer and pathogenicity.",

Adherens junctions (AJs) and tight junctions (TJs) are essential components to maintain the integrity of the intestinal epithelium, which is crucial for proper functions of the barrier that regulates the absorption of nutrients and restricts uptake of luminal bacteria [69, 70] . It is widely acknowledged that porcine intestines are the primary site for PEDV multiplication, and structural alterations of adherens and tight junctions have been mentioned in intestinal epithelial cells infected with PEDV in vivo and in vitro [71, 72] . In our study, adherens and tight junctions were both found under dysregulation during virulent PEDV infection, while slight changes were induced by CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV. Previous report indicated that PEDV infection lead to watery diarrhea and severe dehydration in piglets, and meanwhile accompanying with severe villous atrophy, a reduction in the villous height and crypt depth. These might be results of the interruption of digestion and absorption of nutrients and electrolytes, caused by the alteration of adherens and tight junctions in the process of PEDV infection. Furthermore, many significantly altered proteins covered in these signaling pathways were identified and quantified. The precise mechanism concerning host cellular structure alteration and diarrhea might be elucidated based on these substantial evidences.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is considered as an important component in regulating pathogenesis of many infectious diseases. In the process of virus infection, apoptosis inhibition can prevent premature cell death and thus maximize viral replication, while apoptosis induction can facilitate virus release and dissemination from infected cells [73, 74] . The initiation of apoptosis is usually controlled by the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway, and the mitochondrial-involved intrinsic pathway. In the present study, two apoptosis related proteins were detected and quantified. AIFM1, a mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), functions as a key pro-apoptotic factor in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by releasing from the mitochondria and translocating to the nucleus. Significant up-regulation of AIFM1 was confirmed in virulent PEDV infected cells and therefore apoptosis might be potentially induced. This was consistent with a previous report that PEDV infection could induce apoptosis through activation of mitochondrial apoptosisinducing factor [75] . Besides, caspase-8 is critically involved in extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway in mammals, which is triggered by stimulation of death receptors. Caspase 3, the main executioner caspase, can be activated by the initiator caspase, caspase 8, to bring about the apoptotic phenotype. The down-regulation of caspase-8 expression during virulent PEDV infection implied that an apoptosis inhibition mechanism might exist at early PEDV infection to achieve a higher virus titer, which was also confirmed by Zeng et al [26] . Based on these evidences, a mechanism that weakens virus-induced cell apoptosis to facilitate virus proliferation to a higher virus titer at early virus infection, and mitochondrial AIF-mediated apoptosis to favor virus dissemination and pathogenicity might coexist during virulent PEDV infection, just like the case of SARS-CoV [76] .",

Calnexin is a molecular chaperone in ER, regulating the folding and maturation of glycosylated proteins [77] . Previous studies have demonstrated that calnexin strictly monitored the maturation of viral proteins, such as HIV gp160 and S protein of SARS-CoV, which were important for their infectivity [78, 79] . In addition, calnexin was also observed with increased expression in HCV infection [80] . Similarly, calnexin was significantly up-regulated by 7.92-and 2.88-fold change, in virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like PEDV infections, respectively. This was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis. These evidences supported our hypothesis that the higher expression of calnexin might promote the maturation of S protein, resulting in conferring more severe infectivity on the virulent PEDV than the CV777 vaccine strainlike strain.",
