To evaluate porcine lung lesions associated with P. multocida, populations of inflammatory cells were examined by immunohistochemistry in necrotic lung lesions from nine pigs and exudative lung lesions from eleven pigs. Lungs from five pigs served as controls. All cases were selected from naturally infected pigs using co-infection based criteria to make them as comparable as possible. The inflammatory cells demonstrated by immunohistochemistry were T-lymphocytes (CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + subsets), B-lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and IgA + , IgM + and IgG + cells.",

No differences in the numbers of CD4 + T-lymphocytes, IgG + and IgM + positive cells were found between necrotic and exudative cases. The results show that P. multocida significantly alters the inflammatory response in the lung and that lesions associated with P. multocida display diverse inflammatory responses according to their distinct morphological pattern.",

In lungs where P. multocida was present, a larger number of all cells identified by immunohistochemistry were found. This demonstrates that P. multocida contributes to the inflammatory reaction of the lung during natural infection. The perivascular cuffing with T-lymphocytes, predominantly seen in group B, has been described in experimental infections of pigs with P. multocida (Berndt and Muller, 1995) , and could therefore be a specific host response against P. multocida also in natural infections.",
