[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Recently, the Internet has become a transformative technologic advance for dispersing information to a widespread audience. Because searching, organizing, and sharing information has never been easier, authors of medical and scientific articles have been incorporating Internet references to support material in their publications. 6, 7 Approximately 3% of all references within recently published scientific and medical journals are Internet references. 6,7 In our own experience retrieving Internet references, we found that many of them were no longer active or no longer contained the material originally referenced in the article. Using Internet references within published articles becomes problematic for the readers of scientific and medical journals if the supporting material for factual statements disappears. This problem has been identified in high-impactfactor journals such as Journal of the American Medical Association, Science, and New England Journal of Medicine. [7] [8] [9] Our objective was to evaluate the accessibility of all Internet references appearing in Annals of Emergency Medicine for 2000, 2003, and 2005 .

Of these inaccessible Internet references, 55% could not link to an active Web site, and 37% would link to a generic but related Web site that did not contain the authors' intended information. During our attempts at accessing these Internet references, we often could not decide whether we were viewing the material the authors had viewed when writing the article. A central function of references is to provide support for statements put forward by an author. If a reader questions a fact, he or she can go to the supporting reference and review that information. Traditionally, if a journal article is cited in a reference section, that journal can be accessed and the reader can be confident that the article he or she is reading was the exact article that the author intended to cite. The reader may then participate in a dialogue with the author by challenging his interpretation of the data presented in the reference. If this dialogue is held in a public forum such as in a letter to the editor, the readers may benefit from a deeper insight into the topic at hand. Authors are held to a high degree of accountability for the factual statements they make and reference. If the supporting material in a reference disappears or changes over time, components of a meaningful dialogue and author accountability are damaged.",

From 2000 to 2005, Internet references increased from 1% to more than 5% of the total references. Because of the convenience of the Internet, authors are recognizing the value of the Internet as a resource. If the use of Internet references continues to increase, the problems associated with inaccessible information will increase also.",

            "text": "Several solutions to the problem of inaccessible Internet references have been proposed. Published reports have suggested that the author or publisher keep a digital or hard copy of the information contained within an Internet reference. 8, 9, 11, 12 These solutions are not intuitively appealing because authors may become unavailable and publishers may go out of business. Now that the technology exists to digitally archive information, a better solution available to authors and publishers is the archiving of Internet references. The 2 archiving systems that are available are Internet Archive (available at http://www.archive.org) and WebCite (available at http:// www.webcitation.org). [9] [10] [11] [12] Both of these systems can be used free by authors, readers, journals, and publishers. 9,10 In comparing Internet Archive to WebCite, we feel that WebCite is the better system. Internet Archive is limited in that it can store only static information, thus excluding video, representation of databases, and other dynamic sources. 12,13 In addition, Internet Archive acts as a crawler, so Internet references that have password restrictions or restrictions to \"crawlers\" may not be accessible. 12 WebCite, on the other hand, takes a \"snapshot\" of the Web site and immediately provides a \"permalink\" URL that the author can publish. 10 The permalink URL will immediately take the reader to the snapshot of the Web site. The WebCite's use of the permalink would ensure that the reader was viewing the exact Web site the author had viewed when writing the article. Last, WebCite has formed partnerships with libraries and preservation consortia that have legally agreed to support the service to ensure long-term availability to authors, readers, and publishers. 10 There is no standardized requirement among scientific or medical journals' instruction to authors for archiving Internet references. 14 As of 2003, 99% of high-impact journals do not provide instructions to authors on archiving digital information. 11 Given the increasing inaccessibility of Internet references over time, we concur with previous recommendations that the time to require archiving of Internet references has arrived. 6-9,11,12",
