            "text": "A novel microarray was constructed with DNA PCR product probes targeting species specific functional genes of nine clinically significant respiratory pathogens, including the Gram-positive organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes), the Gram-negative organisms (Chlamydia pneumoniae, Coxiella burnetii Haemophilus spp., Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as the atypical bacterium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In a \"proof-of-concept\" evaluation of the developed microarray, the microarray was compared with real-time PCR from 14 sputum specimens from COPD patients. All of the samples positive for bacterial species in real-time PCR were also positive for the same bacterial species using the microarray. This study shows that a microarray using PCR probes is a potentially useful method to monitor the populations of bacteria in respiratory specimens and can be tailored to specific clinical needs such as respiratory infections of particular patient populations, including patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis.",

More recent studies have utilised their potential for simultaneous detection of unlimited numbers of pathogens to diagnose infection in a range of sites One such study focused on the rapid diagnosis of bacteraemia by universal amplification of 23S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) followed by hybridisation to an oligonucleotide array (Anthony et al., 2000) ). They found that rapid identification and discrimination between bacteria could be achieved, and that adding further oligonucleotides to the panel without increasing significantly the complexity or the cost, could continually extend the accuracy, range and discriminatory power of this assay. A similar conclusion was found in another study which looked at a DNA array to detect bacterial pathogens in environmental samples (Call et al., 2003) . Wang et al. (2002 Wang et al. ( , 2004 investigated intestinal bacteria in human faecal samples using 16S rDNA PCR and oligonucleotide microarrays. The sensitivities of the array assay were comparable to classic culture. Chizhikov et al. (2001) developed a microarray targeting sequences from six genes encoding bacterial antigenic determinants and virulence factors to detect enteric pathogens (Salmonella spp, Shigella spp and Escherichia coli). The specificity was superior to culture on the array as identification relied on complementary hybridisation with the oligonucleotide rather than with agarose gel analysis based on the size of the PCR product.",
