            "text": "Although mucosal immune responses are critical for protection of hosts from clinical illness and even mortality caused by mucosal pathogens, the molecular mechanism of mucosal immunity, which is independent of systemic immunity, remains elusive. To explore the mechanistic basis of mucosal protective immunity, gene transcriptional profiling in mucosal tissues was evaluated after the primary and secondary immunization of animals with an attenuated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a prototype of Coronavirus and a well-characterized mucosal pathogen. Results showed that a number of innate immune factors including toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic-acid-inducible gene-1 (RIG-1), type I interferons (IFNs), complements, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1b) were activated locally after the primary immunization. This was accompanied or immediately followed by a potent Th1 adaptive immunity as evidenced by the activation of T-cell signaling molecules, surface markers, and effector molecules. A strong humoral immune response as supported by the significantly up-regulated immunoglobulin (Ig) gamma chain was observed in the absence of innate, Th1 adaptive immunity, or IgA up-regulation after the secondary immunization, indicating that the local memory response is dominated by IgG. Overall, the results provided the first detailed kinetics on the molecular basis underlying the development of primary and secondary mucosal immunity. The key molecular signatures identified may provide new opportunities for improved prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to combat mucosal infections. #",

This suggests that the development of mucosal immunity relies on the direct interaction of local epithelial cells with pathogens (Cavanagh, 2003; Dhinakar and Jones, 1997) .

The long-recognized innate factors that are important in enhancing adaptive immunity include, but are not limited to, toll-like receptors (TLRs), complements, type I interferons (IFNs), inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. Indeed, cytokines, complements, and molecules derived from microorganisms such as cholera toxin (CT) and CpG DNA, which are capable of activating TLRs, cytokines, and chemokines, have been employed as vaccine adjuvants to enhance local and systemic adaptive immunity (Fearon, 2000; Holmgren et al., 2003; Staats and Ennis, 1999) . But it still remains elusive on the molecular basis for the regulation of mucosal immune response introduced by mucosal vaccination, including the induction of mucosal innate immunity, the communication and transition from local innate to local adaptive immunity, as well as the commitment to memory response which is rapidly recruited upon reencounter of the same mucosal pathogen.",

            "text": "It was the aim of this study to characterize the specific gene expression profiles of the upper respiratory tract (the trachea) at defined time points after vaccination of animals with a model virus and to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of mucosal immunity. The disease model we chose to use is chicken infectious bronchitis (IB). Chicken IB is a well-studied disease localized mainly to a mucosal site (the trachea) and is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the prototype of the Coronavirus family (Cavanagh, 2005 (Cavanagh, , 2003 Dhinakar and Jones, 1997) . The disease can be prevented by vaccination of chickens with attenuated live virus vaccine only when administered locally (intranasal or intra-ocular), not systemically (Cavanagh, 2005; Gillette, 1981; Seo and Collisson, 1997) . Studies also indicated that local cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play an essential role in the clearance of IBV during early IBV infection (Seo and Collisson, 1997) , while mucosal antibody response plays a critical role against subsequent infections (Gillette, 1981) . Additionally, the kinetics of epithelial cells and antigen specific immune cells during IBV infection or after vaccination has been well characterized in previous studies (Kotani et al., 2000a,b) . In light of the well-characterized mucosal immunity of chicken IBV and the availability of a well-designed and validated chicken cDNA microarray for global gene expression study (Burnside et al., 2005) , we believe that IBV serves as an excellent model to better understand the molecular regulation of mucosal immunity by looking at the gene expression profiles at defined times after vaccination. We are particularly interested in identifying the sequential molecular regulation of epithelial cells that may contribute to the activation and recruitment of antigen specific immune cells in the trachea. Because the mucosal surfaces are under constant exposure to a variety of pathogenic organisms, a better understanding of the molecular regulation of mucosal immunity is critical in designing novel strategies for prophylactic and therapeutic control of mucosal-related infectious diseases.",

TLR7 is required for single stranded RNA virus recognition and the subsequent cytokine production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and activation of B cells (Lund et al., 2004) . TLR2/6 pathway is responsible for recognition of peptidoglycan and lipoprotein from Gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas, mycobacteria, and spirochetes (Hoebe et al., 2005) . However, unlike its counterpart of type 2, type 1 TLR2 possesses less ability to act as a receptor for bacterial LPS and is likely to be a novel sentinel for viral infection (Fukui et al., 2001) . Overall, it appeared that TLR3, TLR7, and type 1 TLR2/6 all played some roles in the local recognition of the RNA virus, IBV-Mass.",

Firstly, IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1, 4.3-, 2.0-, 2.4-fold for d1, d3, and d5) was responsible for sustained IFN transcription after infection. Secondly, IFNs triggered a Jak/Stat signaling cascade and induced p53-dependent antiviral protection (Shin-Ya et al., 2005) . This was revealed by the activation of STAT (STAT-1, 6.4-, 3.4-, 3.7-fold for d1, d3, and d5; STAT-4, 3.4-, 2.5-, 3.0-fold for d1, d3, and d5) p53 (p53-inducible proapoptotic scotin, 9.1-, 5.5-, 6.8-, 2.4-, 4.0-, and 2.3-fold for d1, d3, d5, d8, d12, and d24; CD82/R2 leukocyte antigen, 2.0-, 2.2-, 2.4-, 3.9-, and 2.6-fold for d1, d3, d5, d12, and d24; liver LKB1-interacting protein, 2.6-, 1.9-, 2.1-, and 2.1fold for d1, d3, d5, and d21) and caspase cysteine proteases (caspase-6, 2.7-, 2.6-fold for d1 and d3; and CARD-9, 3.1-, 3.6-, 2.4-fold for d1, d3, and d5) (Fig. 2) . Thirdly, IFN antiviral state was enhanced via IFNresponsive genes. Myxovirus resistance protein Mx (increased 18.4-, 4.1-, and 2.7-fold for d1, d3, and d5) has intrinsic GTPase to sense nucleocapsid-like structures during infection and traps viral components to locations unavailable for new particle generation . The novel very large inducible GTPase VLIG-1 (increased 20.2-, 5.3-, and 8.8-fold for d1, d3, and d5) is responsible for regulation of several hundred genes in pathogen defense at the transcriptional level (Klamp et al., 2003) .

CXCR4 is important for the regulation of stem/ progenitor cell trafficking (Tamamura et al., 2006) . It has been reported that CCR6 is responsible in regulating the positioning and recruitment of DCs and T cells during inflammatory and immunological responses in small intestine (Lugering et al., 2003) . CHEMR23 interacts with chemerin and plays a key role to direct macrophage and immature DC trafficking from blood to tissue sites (Zabel et al., 2005) . SDF4 is a novel calcium-binding protein that localizes to the Golgi compartment, and its role in immune cell recruiting remains to be defined. Chicken has a different repertoire of chemokines from those of mammals, and little is known about the function of ah221 and ah294, which could be an orthologue of mammalian CCL5 (Hughes et al., 2007) .

Abundant transcription factor Spi-1 promotes macrophage differentiation (DeKoter and Singh, 2000) . GMF is an intracellular signal transduction regulator to stimulate p38, NF-kB, and GM-CSF and promote CD4 \u00c0 /CD8 + cell differentiation (Yamazaki et al., 2005) . M-CSF is essential for macrophage linage development. Neutrophils induce respiratory burst through NADPH oxidase enzymes (p47-phox, 2.0-, 2.8-, 2.6-, 2.9-, 2.7-fold from d1 to d12; p40-phox, 4.2-, 2.9-fold for d1 and d3; NADPH dehydrogenase, 2.1-, 1.9-, 2.3-, and 3.1-fold for d1, d3, d5, and d21; NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase ASHI, 2.3-, 2.7-, 3.0-, 2.1-fold from d1 to d8), which produce large quantities of reactive oxygen species to kill the phagocytosed pathogens. Neutrophil function was also accomplished via degranulation, a process that release antimicrobial cytotoxic molecules, such as protease cathepsin S (2.2-, 2.4-, 2.0-fold for d1, d3, and d5) and bactericidal permeability-increasing protein BPI (25.8-, 4.0-, 4.9-fold for d1, d3, and d5). BPI is recognized as a ''molecular shield'' for mucosal surface protection (Canny et al., 2002) . Since neutrophils are generally specific to bacterial defense, its unexpected influx locally may suggest a previously unappreciated protective mechanism against virus infections.",

P2X7 functions as a major regulator in IL-1 bmediated inflammation via its cation channel (Chen and Brosnan, 2006) . HMGB1 is derived from activated macrophages and functions as a late mediator of systemic inflammation (Yan et al., 2000) .

Exogenous viral antigen was processed and presented by MHC class II (b chain, 3.1-, 2.6-, 2.0-fold for d1, d3, and d5; invariant chain, increased 2.2-, 2.4-, 2.5-, 2.0-fold from d1 to d8) on mature DCs (mDC marker CD83, 4.4-, 1.9-, 2.0-fold for d1, d3, and d5). Interaction of TCR on CD4 + T cells with the MHC class II-peptide complex resulted in activation and differentiation of T lymphocytes via a series of biochemical events. Full activation required the interaction of other surface proteins and costimulatory molecules, e.g., CD8a (2.3-, 3.1-fold for d5 and d8) is activated by lymphoid-restricted zinc finger transcription factor Ikaro (2.5-, 3.9-fold for d3 and d5) (Urban and Winandy, 2004) , and CD3 complex (CD3d/g homolog, increased 3.6-, 4.8-, 8.1-, 6.9-, 2.3-, 1.9-, 2.1-, 3.3-fold from d1 to d24; CD3e, 3.1-, 3.6-, 7.0-, 3.4-, and 2.5-fold for d1, d3, d5, d8, and d24).

In addition, T-cell activation was further facilitated by lymphocyte cytosolic protein LCP-1/L-plastin (11.4-, 9.7-, 9.5-, 3 .7-, and 2.2-fold for d1, d3, d5, d8, and d24), which binds to actin to promote surface transport of the T-cell activation molecules CD69 and CD25 (Wabnitz et al., 2007) .

Ig g chain was activated after primary immunization and surged immediately after the secondary immunization (5.1-, 6.6-, 1.0-, 5.1-, 4.9-, 7.8fold from d5 to d24). Surprisingly, no activation of Ig a chain (IgA) was observed. Instead, data obtained from real-time RT-PCR revealed that the transcription of Ig a chain was suppressed (\u00c027.33-, \u00c017.86-, \u00c04.51-fold for d8, d12, and d22, respectively). This is further supported by the suppression of TGF-b (\u00c02.4-, \u00c02.2-, \u00c03.6-fold for d5, d8, and d12, respectively), a regulator for IgA. Taken together, the results suggested that IgA might not be an important arm of local primary and secondary immunity against IBV-Mass and the dominant local IgG immunity after secondary immunization provided protection from virus entry by neutralizing viruses.",

            "text": "Since transcriptional control is one of the most important aspects in regulating any biological process, transcriptional profiling has been widely used to uncover the underlying mechanisms of a number of complex biological processes including development and diseases. Here, we have intended to identify the molecular mechanism of mucosal immunity by examining the local gene transcription profile at defined time points after primary and secondary immunizations. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to characterize the molecular control of the protective mechanisms in mucosal immunity. We recognized that a diversity of cellular and molecular factors are involved in the induction and regulation of mucosal immunity. A number of innate factors such as TLRs and RIG-1 worked synergistically in the initial sensing of the danger signals, which is followed by the induction of type I IFNs, IL-1b, MIP-1b, SOCS 3, and other soluble mediators which not only triggered the antiviral state of adjacent cells, but also facilitated the activation and migration of T cells to local tissues by modifying the local microenvironment and dictating the type of adaptive immunity. More recent studies have suggested that TLR3 and RIG-1 are also involved in the local recognition of other respiratory RNA viruses including influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (Le Goffic et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007) , suggesting that multiple universal innate factors are activated in the local respiratory tract upon virus entry and they may play a critical role in triggering a potent local adaptive immunity by working synergistically. We observed that potent innate and Th1 adaptive local immunity were induced by IBV-Mass primary immunization and they were mainly responsible for the viral clearance from the local infection sites. A strong humoral response dominated by mucosal IgG, the specific antibody already primed earlier, was activated after the secondary immunization and provided protection against virus entry by neutralizing virus particles. These observations are consistent with the previous studies showing the importance of local CTL response in primary infection and local neutralizing antibody response against secondary exposure to the same virus (Gillette, 1981; Seo and Collisson, 1997) . The molecular transcription profile further provides proof for the hypothesis that strong innate and adaptive local immunity are efficiently induced locally by mucosal vaccination (Cavanagh, 2003; Dhinakar and Jones, 1997) , and it is this regional immune response that plays a critical role in providing effective protection against mucosal pathogens.",

Surprisingly, T-cell activation was detected as early as day 1 after primary immunization, suggesting the efficient trafficking of T cell to local tissues. Several chemokines including CXCR4, CCR6, and cell adhesion molecules such as syndecan-4 were activated locally and may be partly responsible for the migration of activated T cells. New evidence clearly suggests that cytokines such as IL-1b might be critical for the induction MMPs and the subsequent migration of immune cells such as neutrophils and CD4 + T cells to local tissues (Flannery et al., 1999; Gurney et al., 2006; Koshy et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; Wertheimer et al., 1995) , a process that has long been recognized to be mediated mainly by chemokines. A transient block of CD4 + T-cell migration to the lamina propria of the intestinal tract was observed in MMP3-deficient mice . We reason that MMP3, possibly activated by IL-1b as described previously (Flannery et al., 1999; Wertheimer et al., 1995) , may facilitate the migration of T cells to local tissues, leading to development of a Th1 dominant local immunity and the eradication of virus from local tissues. This is supported by the observation that a significant increase in MMP3 from d1 to d8 after primary immunization occurred concurrently with the up-regulation of T-cell receptors locally, suggesting that MMP3 may be important in the migration of T cell to local respiratory mucosal tissues, similar to what was found in the gut and intestine tract . Further investigations are needed to confirm the potential role of MMP3 in facilitating the migration of activated T cells to the respiratory tract.",

Instead, local IgG was induced after primary immuni-zation and surged immediately after secondary immunization, suggesting a dominant local IgG in the stimulation of memory response against viral reinfection. Our data is consistent with the recent study showing that chlamydial re-infection is successfully prevented by heightened IgG2a and IgG2b responses in secretions in IgA deficient (IgA \u00c0/\u00c0 ) mice (Morrison and Morrison, 2005) . More recent studies have also suggested an important, protective role of IgG against influenza virus infection in mice, where IgA is not indispensable to confer protection, and IgG1, IgG2a, and IgM may be effective in preventing influenza virus infection in IgA knockout mice . Similarly, complete protection of both the upper and lower airways was correlated with the presence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-specific IgG in mucosal secretions at the time of challenge (Valosky et al., 2005) . Others have elucidated that IgA might be only important in non-pathogen induced antibody responses Mbawuike et al., 1999) . Taken together, local IgG response is one of the dominant responses in secondary immunity against pathogens and may provide an in situ defense of the mucosa against invasion. Results from our and others' studies challenged the role of IgA in secondary immunity in virus infection. It will be of interest to further examine the secondary immunity against other bacterial and viral infections to see if this is a universal mechanism.",

Together with the rapid increase of IgG after secondary immunization, we suspect that the virus was immediately neutralized by local IgG after administration to avoid recognition locally by innate factors and the subsequent activation of CTLs. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that complete protection by local IgG is the reason why no local innate and CTL responses were induced. The role of memory CTLs in preventing local virus entry appeared to be minimal, if any. The result is contradictory to the previous study showing that memory CTLs mainly reside in local nonlymphoid tissues and is ready to react after second pathogen exposure (Masopust et al., 2001) . Since the authors did not examine the activation of the memory CTLs following a second exposure to the same pathogen, the role of memory CTLs in preventing pathogen entry remains unclear. We prefer the notion that memory CTLs may only be activated if the virus breaches the innate barriers and enters the host and that they are important in combating local infection and eradicating infected cells. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate the role of memory CTLs in local protection.",

As schematically shown in Fig. 4 , multiple innate factors were activated, worked synergistically, and orchestrated the activation of T cells as supported by the up-regulation of Fas, granzyme, porimin, and other weapons of CTLs used to kill virus-infected cells, which is followed by the activation of B cells and increased expression of Ig gamma chain locally. The kinetics of molecular signatures identified here by transcriptional profiling not only provides a proof for the mechanistic basis of mucosal immunity to respiratory viral pathogens but also confirms the previous observations on mucosal immunity defined using traditional immunology tools (Gillette, 1981; Seo and Collisson, 1997) . It should be noted that the molecular signatures defined here may not be complete due to the lack of certain genes on the 13 k cDNA array and the inevitably missed time points. Nevertheless, expressional kinetics reveals the molecular mechanisms of primary and secondary mucosal immunity and provides guidance on how vaccines could be best designed to confer efficient protection against mucosal infectious diseases in respiratory tracts. Fig. 4 . A proposed model on the molecular kinetics of mucosal immunity following local immunizations of IBV-Mass. IBV antigen is firstly recognized by two independent innate mechanisms including TLR and RIG-1. Cytokines such as IL-1b and IFNs activated by the innate pathways regulated the activation of T cells and induced cells to an anti-viral state. In addition, a number of other innate responses are also induced, including phagocytosis, complement, inflammation, cell death, and antigen presentation, which created an ideal microenvironment for T-cell activation and served as a bridging factor for connecting the local innate and adaptive immune systems. Once the T cells are activated, two branches of adaptive immune responses are initiated with CTLs being activated initially, followed by humoral immunity. CTLs, together with parts of the innate immunity, are responsible for the virus clearance from the local infection sites. Local IgG is the only and dominant arm of local secondary immunity against subsequent virus exposure.",
