            "text": "Porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is a common cellular receptor for swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). To investigate single-chain fragment variable (scFv) repertoire against pAPN, the genes encoding the immunoglobulin light chain variable region (VL) and heavy chain variable region (VH) were amplified by reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a series of degenerate primers from the spleen of BABL/c mice immunized with native pAPN. The VL and VH amplicons were combined randomly by a 12 amino acid flexible linker by splicing by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR), which produced the scFv gene repertoire. After ligation of the scFv gene repertoire into the T7Select10-3b vector, a mouse scFv phage library specific for pAPN was produced through in vitro packaging. The primary scFv library against pAPN contained 2.0 \u00d7 10 7 recombinant phage clones, and the titer of the amplified library was 3.6 \u00d7 10 9 pfu/mL. BstNI restriction analysis and DNA sequencing revealed that 28 phage clones from the primary pAPN scFv library showed excellent diversity. The effectiveness of the scFv library against pAPN was verified further by phage ELISA using the recombinant protein of the pAPN C subunit as coating antigen. The construction and evaluation of a murine scFv library against the common receptor pAPN of porcine coronaviruses TGEV and PEDV using the T7 phage display system are described.",

In the past 30 years, disease caused by TGEV and PEDV has broken out frequently in many swine-raising countries, and has led to heavy economic losses (Jung and Chae, 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Vemulapalli et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010) . Many studies of these viruses have been reported over the past decades, but TGEV and PEDV still exist and cause frequent occurrences of piglet diarrhea in various countries, notably in China (Sun et al., 2007 (Sun et al., , 2008 Elia et al., 2010; Ribes et al., 2011; Nogales et al., 2011) . Most researchers have focused mainly on how to kill or control the pathogens TGEV and PEDV.

(2004) were chosen to amplify the immunoglobulin light chain variable region (VL) and heavy chain variable region (VH) genes. It has been revealed that these primer sets showed good coverage for amplification of the whole VL and VH gene repertoire by RT-PCR. The VL and VH amplicons were connected by a flexible linker of 12 amino acids by SOE-PCR, to generate the scFv gene repertoire. A number of studies have shown that the length of the linker region between the VH and VL genes affects the activity of scFv molecules, and a linker 12 amino acids in length is suitable to maintain the affinity of the scFv molecules . In this study the mid-copy number vector T7Select10-3b with EcoRI/HindIII arms for directional cloning of appropriately prepared inserts was used to construct the scFv phage library against pAPN. Generally, each recombinant T7 phage produced by the T7Select10-3b vector is capable of displaying 5-15 copy scFv molecules, and is suitable for the stable expression of the scFv gene and other genes up to about 750 bp in size. The size of the primary scFv library and the amplified scFv library specific for pAPN was 2.0 \u00d7 10 7 pfu/mL and 3.6 \u00d7 10 9 pfu/mL, respectively. Although this is considered to represent a sufficiently large scFv library, the size of both the primary library and the amplified library was slightly lower than the recommended size (6 \u00d7 10 8 pfu/mL and 10 10 pfu/mL, respectively). It is suggested that the inserted scFv genes may affect the growth of the recombinant phages to a certain extent.",

The phage ELISA indicated that, in the output phages of the third round of biopanning, forty percent of phage clones demonstrated a positive reaction with the recombinant protein pAPN-C. This result suggests that a large number of mouse spleen lymphocytes were activated and had proliferated as a result of the repeated immunization using the well-characterized native pAPN as immunogen.
