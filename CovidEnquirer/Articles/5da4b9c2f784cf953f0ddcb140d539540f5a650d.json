[1] [2] [3] Increasingly, antibiotic-resistant pathogens including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) are associated with HAP. 4 Respiratory viruses have also recently been identified as potentially important causative pathogens for HAP. 5 Antibiotic-resistant bacteria as well as respiratory viruses pose an ongoing challenge to hospitals, both in patient treatment and in the prevention of transmission of these pathogens from patient to patient. Unfortunately, most clinical studies assessing the impact of HAP on patient outcomes [6] [7] [8] and guidelines for the prevention of HAP 1, [9] [10] [11] are directed at VAP, with little attention focused on nonventilated HAP (NVHAP). This is likely the result of the greater severity of illness in patients in the ICU setting, as well as the ability to more precisely define the presence of true infection in ventilated patients with pneumonia using diagnostic techniques such as BAL with quantitative cultures.",

The Charlson comorbidity index was used as a summative score of underlying disease states. 16 The presence of a new or progressive radiographic infiltrate was based on the interpretation of the chest radiograph by board-certified radiologists blinded to the study. All patient charts identified as having new or progressive infiltrates were reviewed by one of the investigators (M. H. K.) to confirm the radiographic findings and by two other investigators (S. T. M., B. C.) to identify patients meeting the case definition for NVHAP. Pneumonia was classified as pathogen-negative if all respiratory culture results and applied molecular techniques failed to identify a pathogen. Pathogenpositive pneumonia was defined as growth of a pathogenic organism from sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoscopic or blind BAL fluid when tracheal aspirates and bronchoscopic or blind BAL fluid were obtained in patients with NVHAP within 24 h after respiratory failure developed. Additionally, a positive urinary antigen test result for Legionella qualified as a positive culture result, as did positive qualitative nucleic acid multiplex test results for respiratory viruses, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (FilmArray Respiratory Panel, BioFire Diagnostics).",

Hospital resource use was also found to be greater for patients in whom NVHAP developed, as evidenced by greater ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and longer length of stay. Thirty-day hospital readmission was not found to be different between patients with and those without NVHAP. We also found that a viral cause for NVHAP was common, accounting for 24.4% of all cases. The case-control study identified a strong association between hospital mortality and NVHAP. More recently, with the routine application of commercially available viral multiplex testing, Crotty 14 Despite a lower proportion of identified pathogens in the patients with NVHAP compared with those with VAP, the type of microbiological isolates and clinical outcomes were similar regardless of whether pneumonia was acquired during or without mechanical ventilation. This finding would suggest that patient-specific findings, such as severity of illness and immune function, may be more important factors predisposing to nosocomial pneumonia than previous intubation. Moreover, both types of patients should receive similar empirical antibiotic treatment and benefit from preventive measures that are preferentially directed at intubated individuals. Hospital-based quality-improvement initiatives have primarily focused on preventing the occurrence of VAP and not NVHAP. 19, 20 However, it has been difficult to demonstrate attributable mortality from VAP because of the overall severity of illness in the \"at risk\" ventilated patient population. 6 This may account for the inability of the majority of VAP prevention studies to demonstrate reductions in mortality. Our data suggest that NVHAP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality excess and that the prevention of NVHAP could potentially improve patient outcomes.",

            "text": "The emergence of MDR pathogens as a cause of HAP has also resulted in greater administration of inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy, which is associated with excess patient mortality. 21 MDR infection in NVHAP is increasingly common in many parts of the world, resulting in the delayed administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy. [22] [23] [24] Moreover, attributable mortality from HAP may be greater than that associated with VAP because of the lower severity of illness existing at baseline in patients with HAP compared with those with VAP. 25 Several limitations of our study should be recognized. First, the retrospective design did not allow for determination of the cause of mortality. Furthermore, it is possible that we did not identify all cases of NVHAP given that we used respiratory culture results and not International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes to screen for study entry. This was purposely done to obtain a patient cohort for whom the treating physicians had a high enough suspicion for pneumonia to obtain microbiological cultures. Second, the data are derived from a single center, and this necessarily limits the generalizability of our findings. As such, our results may not reflect what one might see at other institutions. For example, Barnes-Jewish Hospital has a regional referral pattern that includes community hospitals, regional long-term acute care hospitals, nursing homes, and chronic wound, dialysis, and infusion clinics. Patients transferred from these settings are more likely to be infected with potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This may explain the relatively high rates of infection with potentially antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria and S aureus. Third, given our sample size, we may have lacked power to identify all important confounders that could affect our mortality end point. Fourth, we did not use a protocol for obtaining specific types of culture samples in all patients, rather deferring this evaluation to the treating physicians. This may have contributed to sampling errors in identifying cases of NVHAP. Fifth, we limited the number of matching variables to maximize the number of patients with NVHAP in our study analysis. This may have contributed to unidentified differences in the case and control populations, such as severity of illness or admission diagnoses, which may have contributed to the outcome differences observed. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that bacterial coinfection was present among patients with a viral cause of NVHAP. Antibiotic administration may have limited the ability of conventional culture methods to identify antibiotic-susceptible bacteria in that setting.",
