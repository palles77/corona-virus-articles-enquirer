We performed additional sensitivity analysis reducing the to 3.7, an estimate of the average value across mainland China studies of COVID-19. 9 We further estimated a counterfactual scenario of the infections dynamics assuming no interventions were implemented, in particular no removal and subsequent isolation of ill persons. We assumed an infectious period of 10 days, with a contact rate remaining the same as in the initial phase of the outbreak. Additionally, in the stratified model of crew and guests, the contact rate was assumed to be different due to the assumption that crew could not be easily quarantined as they had to continue their services on board for all the passengers and possibly had more homogeneous mixing with all the passengers, whereas passengers may be mixing more within their preferred circles and areas.

We found that the reproductive number of COVID-19 in the cruise ship situation of 3,700 persons confined to a limited space was around 4 times higher than in the epicenter in Wuhan, where was estimated to have a mean of 3.7. 9 Interestingly, a rough estimation of the population per square km on this 18-deck ship is 286 by 62 meters (0.32 km 2 ). Assuming that only 50% of decks are being used, approximately 24,400 persons are confined per km 2 on a ship compared to approximately 6000 persons per km 2 (9,000,000/1528) in urban Wuhan. This means that the population density was about 4 times higher on the cruise ship. Thus, both R 0 and contact rate are dependent on population density, as also suggested by previous research. 21 In population-based models on observational data the population per square km is often substantially different, affecting the R 0 and coefficient implicitly by changes in the contact rate expressed as:",

The modelled cumulative number of cases on 19 February, 2020, is 613 out of the 3700 people at risk, while the observed reported number of cases is 619. The counterfactual scenario assuming homogenous rates among crew and guests without any interventions (no removal off the ship or isolation of ill persons nor any quarantine measures for the remaining passengers on boat), estimated the number of cumulative cases to be 2920 out of the 3700 after 30 days, that is by 19 th of February (Figure 2). The net effect of the combined interventions was estimated to prevent a total number of 2307 cases by 19 th February, 2020 (Figure 2).",

The predicted cumulative incidence rates were overestimated for crew while underestimated for guests based on available tests results at the time of writing (Figure 4). These data still need to be validated against the empiric data of test results in all crew and passengers which should soon become available. Instead of keeping all passengers on board, another option would have been to evacuate all individuals onboard the cruise ship earlier, and allow them to go home for a potential quarantine in their respective home countries. We modeled that an evacuation by 3 rd February, 2020, would have resulted in 76 latent cases (cases during the incubation time), while an evacuation by 19 th February would have resulted in 246 latent cases.",
