The model is fitted to data from the Ontario (Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto, Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between March 31st and April 6th, followed by a significant slowing in the number of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto, although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model. It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission, SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that computed for some strains of influenza (J. Math. Biol. 27 (1989) 233). Although it would not be surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than 10% in some regions of the world (if unchecked), lack of data and the observed heterogeneity and sensitivity of parameters prevent us from predicting the long-term impact of SARS. The possibility that 10 or more percent of the world population at risk could eventually be infected with the virus in conjunction with a mortality rate of 3-7% or more, and indications of significant improvement in Toronto support the stringent measures that have been taken to isolate diagnosed cases. r",

SARS is not merely a local endemic disease: it poses a serious risk to the medical community, is a threat to international travelers, is having a substantial negative economic impact in parts of East Asia and is spreading world-wide. The serious danger SARS poses to the medical community is illustrated by the numerous cases of transmission to health-care workers. Startlingly, the man who awakened the world to the dangers of SARS, Dr. Carlo Urbani, succumbed to the disease. Cases of transmission between aircraft passengers are suspected, and relatively short visits to epidemic regions have resulted in infection. The most striking feature of SARS, however, has proven to be its ability to rapidly spread on a global scale. One man with SARS made seven flights: from Hong Kong to M .",

Another individual, a 26-year-old airport worker, appears to have transmitted the disease to 112 people (McNeil and Altmann, 2003) . Clearly, there is an unfortunate interaction between the incubation period of the virus, the widely distributed severity and infectiousness of SARS in different people and the speed and volume of passenger air travel. The adverse economic impact in parts of East Asia far exceeds the disruption of previous outbreaks of avian influenza, earning comparison with the 1998 financial market crisis in that part of the world (Schoen, 2003; MSNBC News Service, 2003a,b) . Although the causative agent of SARS has been determined (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003) , a detailed understanding of the causative virus' pathogenticity and routes of transmission and the dynamics of the epidemic is still at a very early stage. It is uncertain how the virus is transmitted: by droplet or airborne transmission or person-to-person contact. The recent development of laboratory tests promises to improve the epidemiological situation somewhat (Gerberding, 2003) .",

Most infected individuals either recover, typically after 7-10 days, or suffer 4% mortality or higher (C Health, 2003; International Society for Infectious Diseases, 2003a; BBC News, 2003) . SARS appears to be most serious in people over age 40, especially those who have other medical problems such as heart or liver disease. Its symptoms are similar to pneumonia or other respiratory ailments and include a high fever \u00f0X38 C\u00de; shortness of breath, dry cough, headache, stiff or achy muscles, fatigue and diarrhoea (Stein, 2003b) .

The model is used in conjunction with global and local SARS data to estimate the initial growth rate of the SARS epidemic. These rates are used to estimate SARS' basic reproductive number, R 0 ; the classical epidemiological measure associated with the reproductive power of a disease. R 0 estimates the average number of secondary cases of infection generated by a typical infectious individual in a population of susceptibles (Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000) and hence, it is used to estimate the initial growth of a SARS outbreak. We estimate (using data from Ontario, Hong Kong and Singapore) that R 0 is about 1.2. This value is not too different from past estimates of R 0 for influenza (see Castillo-Chavez et al., 1989) despite the fact that superspreaders of SARS have been identified. In fact, the parameter values resulting on this R 0 ; on our population-scaled model, can lead to extremely high levels of infection. We show, via simple extrapolation, that the estimated rate of growth is consistent with the reported date for the first cases of SARS in Hong Kong, however the first cases in Toronto may be several weeks earlier than the February 23 date of the first case reported by the Canadian Health Ministries (Canadian Ministry of Health, 2003) . Our best ''rough'' estimate for Toronto is that the first case occurred sometime around January 29th, and not later than February 28th. The data for Hong Kong are fitted by fixing the parameters k; d and g 1 based on estimates of the observed rates for the corresponding processes. The growth rate b is estimated from observed ''modelfree'' exponential growth in Singapore and Hong Kong.",

Limited data and inconclusive epidemiological information place severe restrictions on efforts to model the global spread of the SARS etiological agent. Thus, we model single outbreaks, ignoring demographic processes other than the impact of SARS on survival. The model is applied to data from Toronto, Hong Kong and Singapore. Because the outbreak dynamics in Singapore and Hong Kong are different from those in Toronto, some of the results may only be indicative of what is happening in those regions of the world (in particular our parameters a and l may change).

The goal is to use the results for single outbreaks as a first step in our efforts to gauge the global impact of SARS. Hence, we focus on three ''closed'' populations (Southern Ontario (Toronto), Singapore and Hong Kong) and postulate differences in the degree of susceptibility to SARS (McNeil and Altmann, 2003; Stein, 2003b ). These differences may be due to varia-tions in contact rates, age-dependent susceptibility or ''unknown'' genetic factors. This last assumption is handled (in a rather crude and arbitrary way) via the introduction of two distinct susceptible classes: S 1 ; the most susceptible, and S 2 ; less so. Initially, S 1 \u00bc rN and S 2 \u00bc \u00f01 \u00c0 r\u00deN where r is the proportion of the population size N that is initially at higher risk of SARS infection. The parameter p is a measure of reduced susceptibility to SARS in class S 2 (Stein, 2003b; McNeil and Altmann, 2003) . E (''exposed'') denotes the class composed of asymptomatic, possibly infectious (at least some of the time) individuals. Typically, it takes some time before asymptomatic infected individuals become infectious. The possibility of limited transmission from class E is included, in a rather crude way, via the parameter q (see Table 1 ). The class I denotes infected, symptomatic, infectious, and undiagnosed individuals. I-individuals move into the diagnosed class J at the rate a: Individuals recover at the rates g 1 (I class) and g 2 (J class). The rate d denotes SARS' disease-induced mortality. The classes R is included to keep track of the cumulative number of diagnosed and recovered, respectively. Furthermore, it is assumed that diagnosed individuals are handled with care. Hence, they might not be (effectively) as infectious as those who have not been diagnosed (if l is small). The parameter l takes into account their reduced impact on the transmission process (small l represents effective measures taken to isolate diagnosed cases and vice versa). Table 1 includes parameters' definitions and the initial values used. Our SARS epidemiological model is given by the following nonlinear system of These parameters are used to compute the basic reproductive number R 0 : differential equations:",

We did not explore the sensitivity of the model to variations in p and q because they are not known and cannot be controlled.

We assume that the population at major risk of SARS infection lives in Ontario's southern part (particularly Toronto), and is approximately 40% of the total population (r \u00bc 0:4 in our model). It is worth pointing out that this value of r is not critical (that is, the most sensitive) in the model. The ''model-free'' approximately exponential growth rates for the various regions of the world are roughly similar except for Canada from March 31st (day 61) to April 6th (beginning the day of the jump in the number of reported Canadian cases), the number of diagnosed cases grew Bexp \u00f00:081t\u00de; where t is measured in days. This rate is substantially higher than elsewhere in the world. In the subsequent week (beginning April 7th, day 68) the number of probable or suspected Canadian cases rapidly rolls over to a smaller growth rate not too far from the rest of the world. We conclude, based on the coincidence of the Canadian hospital closures, the jump in the reported number of Canadian SARS cases on March 31st and the rapid rise in recognized cases in the following week, that Canadian doctors were rapidly diagnosing pre-existing cases of SARS (in either class E or I on March 26th). If we make the assumption that the fundamental disease spreading parameters other than a and l are roughly constant throughout the world prior to March 26th, we can reach two important conclusions. Beginning on March 26th, in Toronto: * a changed from a number 1=aE1=g 1 \u00c0 2E6 days to 1=a 1 p3 days, and * l changed from an uncertain and relatively large value l > 1=2 to lp0:1:",

Similarly, the SEIJR model requires fairly small values of l to achieve a rapid roll-over in the growth rate of recognized cases. The parametric details of how a ''second'' initial condition for Toronto on March 26th is generated do not affect the qualitative aspect of this argument: the Canadian data prior to March 31st (the day of the large jump) are probably not as meaningful as data after that date, and hence only bound the model from below prior to March 26th. The essential aspect of this before-and-after hospital closure argument is that there were substantially more undiagnosed people in classes E and I than in class J on March 26th. This is a reasonable assumption given that the number of cases reported by Canadian officials more than double Fig. 3 . The circles are the cumulative number of suspected or probable SARS cases in Ontario beginning on day 61 (March 31st, the day of the jump) and the number of probable cases up until day 60. The data prior to day 61 only bound the model from below. The lines are the cumulative number of ''diagnosed'' cases C from the SEIJR model (C is the running sum of all diagnosed cases J). The fit to the data is given by a change in the values of a and l on March 26th. Prior to March 26th, a \u00bc 1=6; l \u00bc 0:76: Because the model is poorly constrained prior to day 61, the real purpose of this part of the model is to generate sufficiently large classes of E and I relative to J on March 26th to give the fast increase in C from day 61 to day 67. After March 26th, three scenarios are shown. The fit to the data is given by a \u00bc 1=3; l \u00bc 0:05 (rapid diagnosis and effective isolation of diagnosed cases, dashed line). The second curve is given by a \u00bc 1=6; l \u00bc 0:05 (slow diagnosis and effective isolation, dotted line) and the third curve by a \u00bc 1=3; l \u00bc 0:3 (rapid diagnosis with improved but imperfect isolation, dashdot line). An index case is assumed on February 1st. The transmission rate b is computed using the estimated rate of growth \u00f0r \u00bc 0:0543\u00de for the Ontario data as described in the text.",

We then use our SEIJR model to examine the non-exponential dynamics of the Toronto outbreak. Two features of the Toronto data, the steep increase in the number of recognized cases after March 31st and rapid slowing in the growth of new recognized cases, robustly constrained the SEIJR model by requiring that lE0:05 and a > 1=3 days \u00c01 :",

The fitting of data shows that the initial rates of SARS' growth are quite similar in most regions leading to estimates of R 0 between 1.1 and 1.2 despite the recent identification of superspreaders. Model simulations are fitted to SARS reported data for the province of Ontario, Hong Kong and Singapore. Good fits are obtained for reasonable values of a; the rate of identification of SARS infections; ''reasonable'' values of the control parameters l (a measure of isolation); possible values of p; a crude measure of reduced susceptibility (due to genetic factors, age or reduced contact rates); q a crude measure of the relative degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals; possible values of r a measure of initial levels of population heterogeneity; and, reasonable values of N the effective population size. It is worth noting that for values of N larger than 100,000 the predictions (proportion of cases at the end of the outbreak, etc.) are roughly the same. The introduction of behavioral changes that follow the identification of the first case (reduce values of l at the time of the identification and moving aggressively to identify cases of SARS by increasing 1=a) result in a dramatic reduction in the total number of cases and on mortality in Toronto. Given the fact that SARS appears to kill between 3% and 7% of infected (diagnosed) cases (BBC News, 2003) , it seems quite appropriate to isolate diagnosed people. Although we do not examine the effect of quarantine by varying q; it seems intuitive that quarantining those who came into close contact with positively diagnosed individuals will reduce the total number of cases.",

Recent disclosures (Pomfret, 2003c) reaffirm the importance of carrying out the analysis excluding data from China. We have redone the analysis including the data collected up to April 25 and, our conclusions, remain the same. Current data seem to support higher values for SARS induced mortality rates (BBC News, 2003) . However, our model is most sensitive to the parameters l (effectiveness of isolation) and \u00f0a\u00de diagnostic rate. It is not as sensitive to changes in d: In fact, the consideration of a 7% mortality (dE0:01) rather than 4% reduces the number of cases by about 12%: In Toronto, we have estimated 612 diagnosed cases with (l \u00bc 0:05 and a \u00bc 1=3 after March 26th). Perfect isolation after March 26th \u00f0l \u00bc 0:00\u00de reduces this number to 396 diagnosed cases. The assumption of homogenous mixing implies that our model is likely to overestimate the size of the outbreak. Hence, the situation in Toronto seems to support the view that this outbreak is being contained. Obviously, the case of the crude model (by design) cannot handle high levels of variability (a stochastic model would be desirable). This possibility is tested (as it is often done in deterministic models) by looking at the sensitivity of the model to parameters (a and l being the most critical). Such sensitivity analyses can also help ''estimate'' the variability in R 0 :",
