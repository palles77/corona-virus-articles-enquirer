Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than non-overlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains 32% or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.",

There is no plausible path by which two non-overlapping genes could re-encode an equivalent protein sequence as overlapping; instead, an overlapping pair arises either when a second gene is born de novo within an existing gene, or when the boundaries of an existing gene are extended to create overlap [38] . In the latter case of \"overprinting\" [7] , [19] , [36] , the extended portion of that gene, if not the whole gene, is born de novo. One overlapping protein-coding sequence is therefore always evolutionarily younger than the other; we refer to these as \"novel\" versus \"ancestral\" overlapping genes or portions of genes. Genes may eventually lose their overlap through a process of gene duplication followed by subfunctionalization [19] , enriching overlapping genes for relatively young genes that have not yet been through this process. However, gene duplication may be inaccessible to many viruses (in particular, many RNA, ssDNA, and retroviruses), due to intrinsic geometric constraints on maximum nucleotide length [6] , [9] , [11] .",

Elevated ISD in the ancestral member of the gene pair might have already been there at the moment of gene birth, or it might have subsequently evolved, representing two subhypotheses within the overall hypothesis of constraint. The overlapping gene pairs that we observe are those that have been retained; if either member of the overlapping pair was born with low ISD, then constraint makes it difficult to adapt to a changing environment, and that pair is less likely to be retained. When the ancestral member of the pair already has high ISD at the moment at which the novel gene is functionalized, long-term maintenance of both genes in the face of constraint is more likely. The \"already there\" or \"preadaptation\" [52] version of the constraint hypothesis predicts that the pre-overlapping ancestors of today's ancestral overlapping genes had higher ISD than other genes, perhaps because these gene pairs are the ones to have been retained. While these ancestral sequences are not available, as a proxy we use homologous sequences from basal lineages whose most recent common ancestry predates the origin of the overlap. For simplicity, we refer to these sequences as \"pre-overlapping\" to distinguish them from \"non-overlapping\" genes never known to have overlap. The preadaptation version of the constraint hypothesis predicts higher ISD in pre-overlapping genes than in non-overlapping genes.",

We perform for the first time the appropriate control, by predicting what the ISD would be if codons were read from alternative reading frames of existing non-overlapping genes. Any DNA sequence can be read in three reading frames on each of the two strands, for a total of 6 reading frames. We focus only on same-strand overlap, due to superior availability of reliable data on same-strand overlapping gene pairs. We classify the reading frame of each gene in an overlapping pair relative to its counterpart; if gene A is in the +1 frame with respect to gene B, this means that gene B is in the +2 frame with respect to gene A. We use the +0 frame designation just for nonoverlapping or pre-overlapping genes in their original frame. If the high ISD of overlapping genes is primarily driven by the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, then we expect their ISD values to closely match those expected from translation in the +1 vs. +2 frames of non-overlapping genes.",

The artifact hypothesis plays no appreciable role in elevating the ISD of overlapping regions; while reading frame (+1 vs. +2) strongly affects the ISD of individual genes, each overlapping gene pair has one of each, and the two cancel out such that there is no net contribution to the high ISD found in overlapping regions. Surprisingly, novel genes are more likely to be born in the frame prone to lower ISD; this seems to be a case where mutation bias in the availability of open reading frames (ORFs) is more important than selection favoring higher ISD for novel than ancestral genes.",

The two members of an overlapping pair share the same %GC content, and random sequences with higher %GC have substantially higher ISD [1] , so this could be responsible for the trait correlation. A facilitate-birth bias toward high ISD in newborn genes might do so in part via high %GC in the overlapping region at the time of birth, causing overlapping sequences to be biased not just toward high-ISD novel genes, but also toward high-ISD ancestral genes. Our 32% estimate attributes all of the ISD elevation in ancestral overlapping genes to constraint, but given the trait correlation shown in Figure 5A , some of this might also be due to birth facilitation, making 32% an underestimate. Note that novel genes born into the +2 frame have high ISD above and beyond the intrinsic correlation ( Figure 5B ), and are thus responsible for the statistical difference between ancestral vs. novel when frame is controlled for ( Figure 4B ).",

One artifact of the genetic code is that +1 frameshifts yield more start codons and fewer stop codons, and hence fewer and shorter ORFs [2] . In our control set of 150 non-overlapping viral genes, we confirm that stop codons are more prevalent in the +2 frame (1 per 11 codons) than the +1 frame (1 per 14) , decreasing the mean ORF length, and that start codons are more prevalent in the +1 frame (1 per 27 codons) than the +2 frame (1 per 111). Similar results were found in the pre-overlapping ancestral homologs, with more start codons in the +1 frame (1 per 33) than the +2 frame (1 per 169), and fewer stop codons in the +1 frame (1 per 20) than the +2 frame (1 per 13). This is reflected in the relative numbers and sizes of our frameshifted ORF controls. Prior to implementing a minimum length requirement (see Materials and Methods), we found 465 ORFs in the +1 frame of our non-overlapping genes, with a mean and maximum length of 24 and 149 amino acids, respectively, while only 92 ORFs were found in the +2 frame with a mean and maximum length of 19 and 92 amino acids. The same pattern was found in the pre-overlapping ancestral homologs, with 65 ORFs found in the +1 frame with a mean and maximum length of 36 and 315 amino acids, vs. 13 ORFs in the +2 frame with a mean and maximum length of 36 and 173 amino acids.",

As a result, when frame is not considered, ancestral and novel overlapping sequences encode very similar levels of disorder (0.41 \u00b1 0.03 vs. 0.42 \u00b1 0.04, respectively), making it easy to miss the evidence for the facilitatebirth hypothesis.",
