            "text": "The vaccine industry is composed of companies that are engaged in any of the following activities: research (including that performed in industry and biotech), development, manufacture, or sales, marketing, and distribution of vaccines. They receive their revenue chiefly from sales of vaccine products or expectations thereof. The vaccine industry is relatively small, compared to the pharmaceutical industry, but growing. We estimate that total infectious disease vaccine sales in 2013 were more than $25 billion worldwide and expected to grow to about $35 billion by 2020. Although components of the vaccine industry are found in 50 countries worldwide, the large vaccine companies are primarily U.S.-or European-based and have the dominant share of vaccine business on a revenue basis; but regional companies are gradually growing their market share on a dose basis (Table 4 .1). 1 In the past 20 years, the vaccine business, a former laggard in the pharmaceutical business, has shown remarkable growth powered by new innovative vaccines coupled with superior pricing strategies ( Fig. 4 .1). 2 Specifically contributing to this spectacular growth were the varicella, hepatitis A, pneumococcal conjugate, shingles, rotavirus, meningococcal conjugate for A, C, Y, W, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines, as well as myriad combination vaccines.",

Process development may be as costly as clinical development and is critically important to the overall success of a vaccine development program. As development proceeds toward licensure, costs escalate as clinical studies become larger, manufacturing scales up, and facilities must be built. Postlicensure studies of safety and efficacy (phase 4) of vaccines are essential and represent a large additional cost. It is important to note that, unlike pharmaceuticals, vaccines that pass early proof-of-concept studies in humans have a very high probability of achieving licensure. Clinical activities are more visible than bioprocess development and clearly drive the go/no-go decisions that direct progress.

[7] [8] [9] These estimates take into account all costs, including R&D costs of products that fail, postlicensure clinical studies, and improvements in manufacturing processes. Approximately 50% of the cost is for construction; the remainder is the cost of capital interest. These numbers have been debated (others estimate $100 million to $200 million); however, the higher estimates have been validated in two ways. First, the number of new vaccines brought to licensure annually by a company or the industry is very small compared with other products, and correlates with R&D expenditures of $600 million to $800 million for each new product. Thus, if a company spends $100 million annually for vaccine R&D, one might expect one new product every 6 to 8 years, and this appears to hold true. Second, biotechnology companies that are focused on one vaccine and have successfully brought it to market have spent $500 million to $700 million on R&D as exemplified by the development of the live attenuated influenza vaccine by Aviron, now Medimmune. In summary, vaccine development from concept to licensure is a lengthy process as illustrated by timelines for some of the currently licensed vaccines (Table 4 .3).",

With few exceptions, each vaccine requires a different plant because of unique manufacturing requirements and the regulatory difficulties associated with changing over to a different product. Some processes are scalable, such as bacterial or yeast fermentation, so that increasing the size of the manufacturing unit (i.e., fermenter) will greatly increase the yield; unit cost will decrease with volume increase. Other manufacturing processes, for example, those dependent on viral growth in embryonated hen eggs or cell lines, are not scalable. Additional plants or modules within plants must be built to increase the throughput, so unit costs do not appreciably decrease with volume increases. Despite the complexity of bulk vaccine manufacturing, 3 to 5 years post-product launch, the fully burdened bulk cost of production for most of the older vaccines declines to as little as $0.50 to $1.00 per dose, and significant elements of product cost are primarily driven by activities related to filling, vialing, and packaging (Table  4 .2).

Through the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the CDC recommends usage of vaccines, and is responsible for most of the public purchases (directly through the Vaccines for Children program for approximately 41%, and indirectly through other federal, state, and local government purchases for approximately 16%, together totaling approximately 57% of all childhood vaccines in the United States), thereby playing a major role in determining the demand and potential profit associated with vaccines. Professional organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians also make recommendations for vaccine usage. There is no federal vaccine program for adults, although Medicare does reimburse for influenza and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Historically, many adults with private insurance were not covered for immunizations. However, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 requires health plans to cover vaccines recommended by the ACIP prior to September 2009 with no copayments or other cost-sharing requirements when those services are delivered by an in-network provider.",

Butantan Institute is another government-owned institution that supplies the full demand for a smaller number of vaccines under the Brazilian NIP. Ataulfo de Paiva Foundation is nonprofit private institution that primarily supplies the BCG vaccine for the Brazilian market. Ezequiel Dias Foundation (FUNED) is a public institution and part of Minas Gerais state. Since 2009, it has supplied the meningococcal conjugate vaccine after transferring the technology from Novartis.",

China is on the verge of the transition from a domestic-only provider to a vaccine exporter, and is demonstrating solid progress in vaccine innovation. Brazil is approaching the point of supplying its own domestic needs, largely with technology transferred from the developed world.

            "text": "Pricing is a critical component of success for large companies and for venture funding of small companies since potential sales determine the desirability of an investment decision. The public expectation is for low vaccine prices, although this has changed somewhat in recent years with the introduction of several new, higher priced vaccines, such as varicella, rotavirus, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, zoster vaccine, and HPV vaccine ( Fig. 4.3) . Large companies believe that vaccines should be priced according to value to society such as reduction in health care and related costs, relief from pain and suffering, and/or prevention of death, and that they should be rewarded for taking the enormous risks inherent in early vaccine development. Such prices far exceed manufacturing costs, but are essential to produce the revenue streams that allow vaccines to be competitive for R&D and manufacturing resources within large pharmaceutical companies or that make biotech companies attractive investment opportunities. In general, vaccine prices have declined when more than two companies have competed in a single vaccine market and profitability has fallen sharply. The influenza vaccine market highlights this cyclical ebb and flow of competitors, most recently with the H1N1 outbreak and shortages in 2009 leading to expanded competition and a vaccine surplus, followed by lower prices in 2010. A vigorous large-company vaccine industry is dependent upon several factors: 1. A rich research environment sponsored largely by the NIH and mostly carried out in academia, as the source for new creative ideas. 2. Strong patent laws and protection of intellectual property. 3. Freedom to price products at fair levels related to value of product to society. 4. Well-implemented immunization practices. U.S. vaccine price evolution polio vaccine grows in developing countries, alternative approaches for local production will be explored, including access to bulk injected polio vaccine, tech transfer by big pharma as a part of their strategic alliances in developing markets, and potential introduction of alternative injected polio vaccine strains such as the Sabin strain. Another key driver will be the expansion of vaccine markets in India, China, and Brazil. Vaccine uptake rates in India, China and Brazil are still low compared with western countries (e.g., India's flu vaccine uptake in 2014 was 1.0 million doses vs. 140 million doses in the United States). 23, 24 The immunization rates are also expected to increase in other low-income countries, which will increase vaccine dose requirements substantially. Most of this demand in low-income countries is expected to be met by manufacturers of DCVMN network. As the DCVMN expands its role, one would expect significant downward pressure on vaccine prices.",

The top four companies are slowly losing market share in doses to the DCVMN sourced doses and when polio eradication is achieved their dose share will drop to less than 20% of worldwide dose volume. In the coming years, as the eradication of polio becomes a reality, the developing country manufacturers will phase out their oral polio vaccine production.
