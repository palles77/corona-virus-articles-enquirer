            "text": "A simple and accurate reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay was developed and evaluated for the detection of porcine pegivirus (PPgV). The specific RT-LAMP primers targeting the conserved regions of NS5A genes were designed and used to detect PPgV. The optimal reaction parameter for RT-LAMP assay was 63\u2103 for 60 min. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 10 copies of PPgV genome, which was 100 times more sensitive than that of the conventional RT-PCR and comparable to nested RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). There was no cross amplification with other related RNA viruses. In the clinical evaluation, the RT-LAMP assay exhibited a similar sensitivity with nested RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. The results indicated that RT-LAMP assay developed in this study could be a highly specific, sensitive, and cost-effective alternative for a rapid detection of PPgV in field settings.",

            "text": "Porcine pegiviruses (PPgV) are small enveloped viruses with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that have recently been assigned as the Pegivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family (Berg et al., 2015) . PPgV genome contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein, which is cleaved into individual proteins including E1, E2, X, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Pegiviruses are detected in diverse mammalian hosts including pigs, humans, horses, chimpanzees, bats, monkeys, and rodents (Yang et al., 2018) . All known Pegiviruses have been classified into 11 species (A-K), and PPgV is a member of Pegivirus K. PPgV was first discovered in Germany in 2016 (Baechlein et al., 2016) , and then reported in the United States in 2018 (Yang et al., 2018) . In China, PPgV was first identified in Guangdong province (Lei et al., 2019) , where vesicular diseases broke out in a swine farm in 2017. The serum samples were submitted to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory of Jiangxi Agriculture University, China for diagnosis. The tested results indicated that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and Seneca Valley virus (SVV) were negative but positive for PPgV by a RT-PCR assay. Although it remained yet unknown about the association between PPgV infection and the disease, more epidemiological studies are needed to address the clinical effect of PPgV on swine health. Currently, there are some methods available for PPgV diagnosis, including conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Yang et al., 2018; Lei et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019) . Therefore, a rapid and accurate method to detect PPgV is urgently needed for monitoring its presence.",

LAMP is a nucleic acid amplification-based method that generally requires a group of four specific external and internal primers (Notomi et al., 2000) . Besides, additional loop primers can be used to further accelerate the reaction (Nagamine et al., 2002) . In this study, a reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) assay was established and evaluated for surveying the prevalence of PPgV in porcine serum samples. A set of three specific primers pairs was designed to amplify the NS5A gene, which is suitable for RT-LAMP and relatively conserved in PPgV genome. The developed RT-LAMP assay showed high sensitivity and specificity for detection of the PPgV. The results tested by RT-LAMP assay on clinical samples were 100% correlated to that of nested RT-PCR and qRT-PCR, indicating the assay could be used for the surveillances of PPgV infection.",

Extraction Kit (TaKaRa, China), and then stored at -80\u2103 until use. The extracted RNA was converted to the first strand of cDNA using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. For the construction of plasmid standards, an 889-bp fragment of the NS5A gene of PPgV was initially amplified using a pair of primers (Table 1) with the 1st strand of cDNA as template. Afterwards, the purified fragment was cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To assess the successful construction of the plasmid, designated as pMD-PPgV, DNA sequencing was performed by Sangon Biotech Company (Shanghai, China). The concentration of pMD-PPgV plasmid was measured by a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The copy number of the cloned gene was quantified as follows: [copy/ \u03bcL = plasmid concentration (g/\u03bcL) / [(plasmid length) \u00d7660) \u00d7 (6.022 \u00d7 10 23 )] (Park et al., 2018) . Serial dilutions of plasmid standards (1 \u00d7 10 6 -1 \u00d7 10 0 copies) were used as templates for the determination of detection limit of PCR, which would be used as a positive control in the RT-LAMP assay system. The three pairs of RT-LAMP primers targeting the conserved regions of NS5A genes were designed based on the sequences of the reference strain (PPgV_GD/CH/2017, GenBank: MG874672.1; PPgV_S8/7/Ger/ 2014, GenBank: KU351671.1; PPgV_903/Ger/2013, GenBank: NC_ 034442.1; PPgV_80 F/Ger/2012, GenBank: KU351670.1; PPgV_33/ ND/2017, GenBank: MG595747; PPgV_29/MO/2017, GenBank: MG595746; PPgV_22/IA/2016, GenBank: MG595745) using the online software Primer Explorer V4 (http://primerexplorer.jp/e/), which included an outer pair (F3 and B3), an inner pair (FIP and BIP), and a loop pair (LF and LB). The inner primers FIP and BIP contained F2 and B2 sequences with the complementary sequences of F1 and B1 (F1c and B1c) in their 5\u2032-terminal, respectively (Fig. 1) . A pair of primers (F4 and R4) was used for amplifying the NS5A gene in conventional RT-PCR and meanwhile served as outer primers for the nested RT-PCR (Table 1 ). The primer pair of F3 and B3 was used as inner primers for nested PCR. A pair of primers (F5 and R5) was used for qRT-PCR targeting the NS5A gene which was designed using the online software Primer 3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/). The specificity of the primers was then examined by a basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast) against the NCBI database. The results demonstrated that there was no hits, that is, no nonspecific primer binding site was observed.",

To determine the optimal reaction conditions, the RT-LAMP reactions were incubated at different temperatures of 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, and 65\u2103 for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 min, respectively. Finally, the reaction was terminated by heat inactivation at 85\u2103 for 10 min. The amplified DNA products from the RT-LAMP were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with the addition of 0.01% ethidium bromide using a gel electrophoresis system (Liuyi, China). The results were also observed directly by color change from orange to green with staining due to the presence of SYBR Green \u2160 (Thermo Scientific, USA). After the amplification was completed, 1 \u03bcl of coloring agent was added to each reaction tube, and the results were then examined visually. In RT-LAMP assay with PPgV RNA as template, the amplified DNA products showed characteristic ladders of multiple bands on an agarose gel, indicating that the final products were a mixture of stem-loop DNA with different stem lengths (Khan et al., 2012) . The results of the RT-LAMP reaction were also determined by direct visualization of the color change under daylight and UV light as shown in Fig. 2 . In contrast, LAMP-specific DNA bands and color changes were not observed in the negative control. Meanwhile, the DNA products of RT-LAMP showed the highest intensity when the reaction was carried out for 60 min (Fig. 3) . In regard to temperature, the optimal reaction temperature of RT-LAMP was 63\u2103. Therefore, the optimized parameter for the established RT-LAMP was 63\u2103 for 60 min.",

The sterile distilled water was set as a negative control template. Nested RT-PCR was performed based on the protocol established in our laboratory (Lei et al., 2019) . For the PCR step of the nested RT-PCR, the primer sets of F4/R4 and F3/B3 respectively served as outer (1 st set) and inner primers (2 nd set) ( Table 1 ). The reaction system contained 1 \u03bcl of plasmid standards of pMD-PPgV (1 \u00d7 10 6 -1 \u00d7 10 0 copies) or 1 \u03bcl of the first PCR product, 2.5 \u03bcl of 10 \u00d7 PCR buffer (Ta-KaRa, China), 0.3 \u03bcl of rTaq (5 U/\u03bcl), 2 \u03bcl of MgCl (25 mM), 1 \u03bcl of dNTP (2.5 mM), and 1 \u03bcl of each primer (10 \u03bcmol). Two rounds of nested PCRs were performed under the following conditions: 94\u2103 for 5 min; 35 cycles at 94\u2103 for 30 s, 55\u2103 for 1 min, and 72\u2103 for 1 min; and a final extension of 72\u2103 for 10 min (Wang et al., 2017) . The conventional RT-PCR was carried out under the same reaction condition as above in nested RT-PCR using the primer pair of F4 and R4 based on the procedure described previously (Lei et al., 2019) . The products of nested RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis with 0.01% ethidium bromide. For qRT-PCR, the primer set of F5 and R5, targeting conserved region of the NS5A gene of PPgV, was used ( Table 1 ). The qRT-PCR assay was performed by using a commercial qPCR kit (TaKaRa, China) based on the manufacturer's procedure. Each 20 \u03bcl reaction mixture consists of 10 \u03bcl of TB Green Fast qPCR mix, 1 \u03bcl of plasmid standards of pMD-PPgV (1 \u00d7 10 6 -1 \u00d7 10 0 copies), 0.8 \u03bcl of (10 \u03bcmol) each forward and reverse primers and 0.4 \u03bcl of ROX. The amplification parameters included an initial denaturation at 95\u2103 for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u2103 for 5 s and 60\u2103 for 1 min. The melting curve analysis was measured using the software supplied with ABI7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The results demonstrated that the detection limit of the developed RT-LAMP was 10 copies/\u03bcl, which was much higher than conventional RT-PCR (10 3 copies/\u03bcl), while it was comparable to that of the nested RT-PCR (10 copies/\u03bcl) and qRT-PCR (10 copies/\u03bcl), respectively (Fig. 4) .",

PPgV epidemics have been confirmed in Germany in 2017, the United States in 2018, and China in 2018. Although several pigs positive for PPgV exhibited vesicle and lameness (Yang et al., 2018) , there is limited evidence that infections were associated with a clinical disease. Therefore, the clinical significance and epidemiological investigation of PPgV infection should be further studied. Nevertheless, the establishment of a sensitive, cost-effective, and rapid assay for detecting PPgV is urgently needed. In this study, a RT-LAMP assay was developed to monitor PPgV in pig populations. Compared to other diagnostic methods, such as conventional RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR (Baechlein et al., 2016) , RT-LAMP assay may eliminate a need for complex procedures and expensive instruments, which makes it suitable for poorly equipped laboratories and clinics (Lopez-Jimena et al., 2018) .",
