            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) represents a natural endogenous mechanism that cells utilize to regulate RNA expression (for review, see [1] [2] [3] ). It is possible to harness this pathway, through multiple means including micro-RNA (miRNA), vector-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA). Gene silencing can be induced by siRNA through a sequence-specific cleavage of perfectly complementary messenger RNA (mRNA), whereas miRNAs mediate translational repression and transcript degradation for imperfectly complementary targets (Figure 1 ). The ability of siRNA to potently, but reversibly, silence genes in vivo makes it particularly well suited as a therapeutic. In addition, because they enter the RNAi pathway later, siRNAs are less likely to interfere with gene regulation by endogenous miRNA [4, 5] . Synthetic siRNAs also have other potential advantages, as drug-like properties of siRNA can often be improved through introduction of chemical modifications, and manufacturing processes are usually amenable to scaled-up production. As a result, siRNAs are the class of RNAi therapeutic that are in most advanced preclinical and clinical studies.",

Having identified potentially optimized siRNA with drug-like properties, the major hurdle of effective delivery to the target cell remains. This typically involves investigation into in vivo efficacy and safety, along with additional studies examining pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and cellular uptake of the formulated siRNA ( Figure 2 ). Multiple approaches for the delivery of siRNA have been published ranging from the relative simplicity of direct administration of saline-formulated siRNA, to liposome-based and polymer-based nanoparticles approaches, to siRNA conjugation and complexation approaches [6] . With the formulation and delivery approaches employed today, silencing can be achieved in several tissues and cell types, most notably through direct delivery of siRNA to the central nervous system and lung epithelial cells, and through systemic delivery of siRNA to hepatocytes and tumor cells [3, 7] . Although multiple routes of administration using siRNA have been published, ranging from direct injection into target tissues to systemic administration, use of siRNA for the treatment of respiratory diseases has tended to focus on direct intratracheal or intranasal delivery of siRNA to the lungs (Table 1 ). In addition, while several different formulations have been investigated for the delivery of siRNA to the lungs, most reported successes have used simple saline formulations (Table 1) .",

Delivery of siRNA directly to the lung has the advantage that, as for any drug, the dose of siRNA required for efficacy is substantially lower when administered near the target cell type. In addition, direct delivery might also reduce any theoretical undesired systemic side effects. Lastly and most importantly in the context of treating respiratory disease, instillation of siRNA (for instance by intranasal or intratracheal administration) allows direct access to lung epithelial cells, important cell types in a variety of pulmonary disorders. Among the myriad of lung pathologies in which epithelial cells are thought to play an important role are diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, multiple viruses infect the lung epithelium, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza, rhinoviruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus (SCV). As a consequence many viral and endogenous gene targets, especially those pertaining to lung epithelial cells, have been silenced using siRNA.",

            "text": "Multiple airborne diseases infect lung or use it as an entry site for systemic infection. SiRNA can be rapidly designed to target the causal agent of viral infections -the virus itself. Not surprisingly, siRNA therapeutics have been designed targeting many different respiratory viruses, including RSV [8 ] , PIV [8 ] , SARS-SCV [9 ] , and influenza [10] [11] [12] (Table 1 ). In an important study Barik and colleagues demonstrated in mice that a single intranasal administration of 70 mg of siRNA targeting either the RSV or PIV P protein (an essential subunit of the viral RNA polymerase) reduced viral titers for both RSV and PIV by more than three orders of magnitude when administered before infection either unformulated or in the form of a lipoplex with Transit-TKO [8 ] . Moreover, therapeutic application of the RSV siRNA up to three days post-infection reduced viral titers by more than two orders of magnitude. Disease pathology associated with RSV infection was also significantly alleviated by RSV siRNA treatment with no observable side effects. Importantly, the specificity of this antiviral effect was clearly demonstrated as the RSV-directed and PIV-directed siRNA only affected replication of the intended virus. The authors also showed that a combination of a RSV-directed and PIV-directed siRNA could be administered and was effective even in the case of viral coinfection [8 ] . Using a similar approach, intranasally administered siRNA, targeting the SARS corona virus, formulated in 5% glucose substantially inhibited viral replication and improved lung pathology in a nonhu-siRNA and lung de Fougerolles and Novobrantseva 281 RNA interference in mammalian cells. RNA interference (RNAi) pathways involve either small interfering RNA (siRNA) or micro-RNA (miRNA). The siRNA pathway involves cleavage of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by the Dicer enzyme complex to yield siRNA. These siRNA are then loaded into Argonaute 2 (AGO2) and the RNAi-induced silencing complex (RISC). If the loaded RNA duplex has perfect sequence complementarity, AGO2 cleaves the passenger (sense) strand so that active RISC containing the guide (antisense) strand is produced. The active RISC with guide strand recognizes target sites on mRNA and AGO2 then performs site-specific cleavage of the mRNA. RNAi therapeutics developed to harness the siRNA pathway usually involves delivery of synthetic siRNA into the cell cytoplasm. By contrast, the miRNA pathway begins with endogenously encoded primary micro-RNA transcripts (pri-miRNA) that are transcribed by polymerase II (Pol II). These are then processed by the Drosha enzyme complex to form precursor micro-RNA (pre-miRNA), and exported to the cell cytoplasm by exportin 5. The precursor miRNA is bound in the cytoplasm by the Dicer complex which processes it further for loading into the AGO2-RISC complex. When the RNA duplex loaded into RISC has imperfect sequence complementarity, the passenger (sense) strand is unwound leaving a mature miRNA bound to active RISC. The RISC-AGO2-bound miRNA then recognizes target sites (usually in the 3 0 -UTR) in the mRNA, leading to translation repression. Binding of miRNA to target mRNA may also lead in certain cases to mRNA degradation in processing (P)-bodies.

In two separate but related studies, it was shown that the same siRNA molecules directed against the nucleoprotein (NP) and acid polymerase (PA) influenza genes could protect mice against lethal influenza infection, including H5N1 virus [10, 12] . In one study, polyethylenimine (PEI) complexes of siRNA were injected intravenously and shown to reduce viral titers by about 10-fold [10] . PEI-complexed siRNA reduced viral load even when administered postinfection. In the second study, a hydrodynamic injection of siRNA followed by intranasal administration of oligofectamine/siRNA complexes reduced viral titers by at least 10-fold and conferred 100% survival to lethally 282 Respiratory Figure 2 Developing an RNAi therapeutic. Several steps are typically required in the identification of an RNAi therapeutic. Selection of lead siRNA candidates usually begins with bioinformatic design, extends through empiric testing of potential siRNA lead candidates in a variety of in vitro assays for those with an appropriate selectivity and immunostimulatory profile. Lead optimization then proceeds with the introduction of stabilizing chemical modifications as required, along with additional in vitro testing for selectivity and potency. The final step involves the identification of an effective and safe delivery formulation. Multiple delivery strategies exist including siRNA conjugation or siRNA encapsulation into nanoparticles, such as liposomes. Beyond the assessment of efficacy and safety, other in vivo parameters such as pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and cellular uptake are also usually investigated. Success typically leads to further research and development activities including formulation optimization and manufacturing, analytic method development, and comprehensive safety/pharmacology analyses in multiple species.

Given the potent immunostimulatory properties of the flu siRNA utilized in these studies (and relative lack thereof in the control GFP siRNA used), the protection seen in the flu infection model may be mediated in large part by siRNA stimulation of innate immunity. The ability of certain unmodified siRNAs to elicit the production of proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-a and interferons, highlights the care that must be taken when examining in vivo endpoints which are sensitive to the release of such cytokines.

[23] assessed the in vivo efficiency of GL67-mediated uptake of siRNAs into airway epithelium in mice. Intranasally delivered GL67-formulated siRNA localized mostly to alveolar macrophages and functional silencing in airway epithelial cells was marginal as siRNAs specific to beta-galactosidase reduced mRNA levels in the airway epithelium of K18-lacZ transgenic mice by one-third with no decrease in protein levels detected [23] . Another established approach for direct lung delivery of nucleic acids involves chitosan nanoparticles. Chitosan is a welltolerated natural biodegradable polymer that forms cationic complexes with nucleic acids. Chitosan-siRNA duplexes, ranging in size from 40 to 600 nm, were shown to reduce by 40% EGFP expression in bronchiole epithelial cells of transgenic mice after the intranasal administration of chitosan/EGFP siRNA formulations [24 ] . A chitosan-based nanoparticle was also used to directly deliver a shRNA targeting the RSV NS1 gene and resulted in significant antiviral activity [25] . More recent work has identified degree of deacetylation and higher chitosan molecular weight as important parameters for efficient siRNA-mediated knockdown [26] . Further formulation optimization is probably required before chitosan can be considered a robust formulation for siRNA lung delivery. A third approach involves the use of cationic cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) such as Tat to mediate siRNA delivery across the cellular membrane. Unfortunately, despite previous studies showing efficacy of siRNA/CPPs in vitro, conjugation of siRNA to Tat-(48-60) and penetratin failed to result in siRNAmediated knockdown of p38 MAPK mRNA in mouse lung in vivo [27] . Lastly, influenza virus envelopes or virosomes have been published to deliver siRNA to the lung [28] . The use of virosomes can be especially beneficial for antiviral siRNA delivery in the lung, because virosomes are expected to be taken up by the cells infected with the virus. However, progress in virosome research is hampered by the difficulty in manufacturing viral envelopes.",
