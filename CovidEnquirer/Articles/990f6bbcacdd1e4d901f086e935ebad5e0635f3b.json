In an all-too-familiar story, there was no inpatient bed, and the woman's son stayed overnight in the ED.",

We pride ourselves in our abilities in caring for the sickest of the sick, patients with trauma, acute coronary syndromes, life-threatening infections, broken bonesdthe list goes on. And as specialists, emergency physicians and nurses excel at providing this care to some of the most fragile patients anywhere. But we are not experts at providing ongoing, inpatient care. We are not, by and large, trained to do this; our processes and environment are not designed to facilitate this; and our staffing is not funded to support this. Every minute that an ED nurse spends drawing daily blood tests and providing medications for a ''boarded'' inpatient is a minute he or she is not spending providing care for a new ED patient. Every ED stretcher that is occupied by a patient awaiting an inpatient bed is a stretcher that is not available for the next patient waiting on an ambulance stretcher or in the waiting room.",

So why do we continue to accept the status quo with a shrug? Inpatient units and ICUs have well-established nursing ratios designed to promote safe and high quality patient care. Medicine units typically mandate a maximum 5-or 6-to-1 ratio of patients to nurses; ICUs establish rules for which patients require 1-to-1 care versus those who can be ''doubled.'' If the available nursing staff is unable to care for additional patients within these predetermined ratios, no further patients are admitted to that unit, period.",

Dr. Peter Viccellio of Stony Brook Hospital in Long Island, NY, has championed the ''full-capacity protocol'', 6 which is based on the concept that selected patients who require admission but for whom no inpatient beds are available should be distributed throughout the hospital rather than all being held in the ED. Admittedly, such an approach is not the answer for all admitted patients; those requiring respiratory isolation, for instance, represent as much of a risk on a ward hallway as they do in an ED hallway. However, at least this serves to reduce the number of admitted patients in the ED so that staff is better able to provide care to those ''boarded'' patients for whom ward hallway placement is inappropriate.",

The majority of these patients spent less than 1 hour in the hallway of the appropriate inpatient unit before moving into a bed; more than a quarter of the patients went directly to a room. 7 But as successful as initiatives such as the full-capacity protocol may be, they are stopgap measures that do not address the underlying, systemic problems that result in ED crowding. What is needed is a paradigm shift in the way we look at access to emergency care in North America. Can it be done? It can, and it has been.",

The National Health Service established an ambitious goal: that patients, on average, would spend less than 4 hours in an ED, regardless of whether they were admitted, discharged, or transferred. At the outset of their program of reform in early 2002, this target was being achieved only 77% of the time. By 2004, more than 96% of ED patients in England spent less than 4 hours in the ED regardless of disposition. 8 To achieve this remarkable degree of success, changes were required at all levels of the system, from the community and the emergency medical services system to ED processes themselves, through to the inpatient units and post-acute care system and back to the community.",

Expanded roles of nurses and allied health professionals in the ED and the use of ED nurse practitioners are just 2 examples of initiatives that significantly contributed to the success story in England. 8 But the first step, as is true of so many challenges in life, is accepting that we have a problem.
