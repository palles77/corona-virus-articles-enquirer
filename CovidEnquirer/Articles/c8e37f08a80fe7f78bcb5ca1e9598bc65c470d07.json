The number of PLS components and the number of variables per component were 182 optimized using the PLS Q criterion and the cross-validation prediction error (mean squared error of prediction 183 (MSEP), leave-one-out), respectively. This method allowed for down-selection of early innate markers explaining 184 most of the variability in the antibody responses (Liquet et al., 2012, Liquet et al., 2016).185 The predictive value of the multivariable linear model was assessed by the root square residuals (RSR), which is the 186 ratio of the root mean square error between predicted and observed values to the standard deviation of cell surface markers were imputed by non-parametric simple imputation based on Random 189 Forests, a method that takes into account the multidimensional and correlated nature of the immune markers Breiman, 2001).Values of cytokine concentrations below the standard curve were also imputed, based on Gaussian 191 Kernel estimation of the density function windowed between 0 and the corresponding Low Level Of Quantification 192 (LLOQ) of the standard curve. The cytokine marker selected by sPLS (IP-10 plasma concentration on day 3) was 193 not concerned by this imputation. 194 For the analyses of differential gene expression after vaccination, we used the voom/limma pipeline, an empirical 195 Bayes estimation of a linear model accounting for the inherent heteroscedasticity of RNA-seq data pipeline for 196 differential expression analyses of RNA Seq data (Law et al., 2014). We first applied a filter to exclude genes with 197 very low mean count from statistical comparisons (exclusion of genes with mean raw count <5) and then used TMM 198 (Trimmed Mean of M-values) normalization and logCPM (logarithm of counts per million reads) transformation. 199 TMM allows for between-sample normalization under the null hypothesis and serves as correction factor for library 200 size in the analyses (Robinson and Oshlack, 2010). The voom method relies on linear modelling of logCPM 201 transformed normalized data, with TMM library size correction, with an estimation of mean-variance trend through 202 a LOWESS curve. This non-parametric approach avoids the negative binomial distribution assumption by instead 203 estimating precision weights. Using these weights, the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline, based on the normal 204 linear model, can then be applied to RNA Seq data. We tested the null hypothesis of log2 fold change =0 (compared 205 to Day 0) for each gene, and used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for controlling FDR to account for multiple 206 testing (Benjamini Y, 1995). Multiplicity-adjusted p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.207 In our analysis, we first applied a filter to exclude genes with very low mean count from statistical comparisons 208 (exclusion of genes with mean raw count <5) and then used TMM (Trimmed Mean of M-values) normalization and 209 logCPM (logarithm of counts per million reads) transformation.
