This along with supporting documents gives a detailed structure of the role of the NHS in any type of major incident from man-made disaster to pandemic flu. This has required preparation of communication, transport, security, military and healthcare systems. Included is also how the response is handled at a more local level and for different levels of response. The Royal Colleges have responded by including specialist training at the higher and advanced level for trainees so that victims are triaged at the scene and received by consultants with appropriate training in such work. Hospitals, ambulance services and intensive care units across the country are able to use networks to ensure not only logical and rapid access to major trauma centres but also to network highly sophisticated skills when advanced life support is required. The NHS is better able to cope with major incidents than ever before.",

Average transfer times have therefore reduced considerable in London and are now 17 minutes.

This may require activation of plans for military intervention to protect emergency departments and pharmacies. This was seen recently during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak. In one area over 80% of MERS cases were coming from within the hospitals.

Since then central funding has established five ECMO centres in England, with retrieval teams trained to manage this caseload (Figure 4) . Team structure and patient pathways A typical patient receiving team is changing as new specialities emerge. When multiple cases arrive simultaneously, leadership and trained personal working with that leadership are vital. Currently in most trusts a consultant in emergency medicine (EM) and/or orthopaedics and trauma will be the team leader. They will be assisted by an anaesthetist, primary and secondary circulating nurse and a radiology technician. In England now all EM doctors are trained in airway control, basic ultrasound and trauma care. Pre-hospital emergency medicine (PHEM) is a subspeciality of anaesthesia, intensive care, EM and acute internal medicine, with the first doctors completing this training in 2015. This training will give the skills required to not only be the trauma team teader (TTL) but also to provide the clinical skills required when patients arrive.",

Rather than waiting for results and tests, damage control runs in parallel, this is 'damage control resuscitation'. During retrieval and initial assessment administration of blood, blood products and tranexamic acid amongst other things can be used empirically in certain scenarios. Blood bank resources need to be considered and diverted appropriately. Much has been learnt from the military medical emergency response teams in this regard. The overall approach to acute clinical management is covered in more detail in Trauma resuscitation and the damage control approach on pages 430e436 of this issue.",
