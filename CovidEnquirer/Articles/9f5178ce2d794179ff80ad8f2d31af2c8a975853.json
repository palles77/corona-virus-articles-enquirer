The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between IgE reactivity to the vaccines and immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs. Sera from 10 dogs that developed immediatetype allergic reactions such as circulatory collapse, cyanosis, dyspnea, facial edema, and vomiting within 1 h after vaccination with non-rabies monovalent or combined vaccines and sera from 50 dogs that did not develop allergic reactions after vaccination were collected. Serum IgE reactivity to the injected vaccines was measured by fluorometric ELISA using a mouse monoclonal anti-dog IgE antibody. Then, IgE reactivity to fetal calf serum (FCS) and stabilizer proteins (gelatin, casein, and peptone) included in the vaccines was measured in sera that had high levels of IgE to the vaccines. Levels of serum specific IgE to the vaccines in dogs with immediate-type allergic reactions (59-4173 fluorescence units [FU], mean AE S.D.: 992.5 AE 1181.9 FU) were significantly higher than those in control dogs 92.4 AE 43.3 FU) (P < 0.001). Of the eight dogs that developed immediate-type allergic reactions and had high levels of serum specific IgE to the vaccines, seven had specific IgE directed to FCS. The IgE reactivity to the vaccines in sera from these dogs was almost completely inhibited by FCS. The other one dog had serum IgE directed to gelatin and casein included in the vaccine as stabilizers. The results obtained in this study suggest that immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs were induced by type I hypersensitivity mediated by IgE directed to vaccine components. In addition, FCS, gelatin, and casein included in vaccines could be the causative allergens that induced immediate-type allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs. #",

Although canine vaccines play a very important role in prevention of the infectious diseases, various adverse reactions after vaccination have been observed in dogs (Brooks, 1991; Greene, 1998; Roth, 1999; Gaskell et al., 2001) . Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis are one of the problematic adverse events after vaccination. Anaphylaxis after vaccination is known to be an immediate-type reaction induced byIgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity (Greene, 1998) . Clinical signs of type I hypersensitivity in dogs after vaccination include hypotensive shock, dyspnea, facial edema, pruritus, weakness, and diarrhea (Greene, 1998) . Anaphylaxis is the most severe reaction after vaccination, and it was reported that postvaccination anaphylaxis resulted in death in some dogs (Ohmori et al., 2002) . Allergic reactions after vaccination are considered as an important practical problem in dogs; however, their immunological mechanism has not been well understood.",

FCS contains a variety of proteins including BSA, fibrinogen, lipoprotein, macroglobulin, and transferrin. Although it was reported that vaccination with rabies vaccine induced the elevation of the serum IgE specific to the vaccine antigens including BSA and bovine fibronectin in some healthy dogs (Hogenesch et al., 2002) , at present, there has been no data on the specific protein(s) included in FCS to cause allergic reactions after vaccination in dogs.

In humans, some children who showed allergic reactions after vaccination also manifested immediate-type allergic reactions to food containing gelatin before the vaccination (Sakaguchi et al., 1996) . Moreover, in dogs, beef is known to be a predominant food that cause food allergy (Jeffers et al., 1996) . From these findings, the dogs that showed allergic reactions after the first vaccination might have been already sensitized to beef allergens. It is unclear when these dogs were sensitized to FCS, gelatin, or casein. In humans, it was reported that a baby developed egg allergy after consumption of large amounts of eggs by the mother during pregnancy and breast-feeding (Reininger et al., 2003) . In our study, when the dogs were 2-3 months old, they exhibited allergic reactions after the first vaccination. It may be possible that prenatal uptake of beef allergens and/or uptake of beef allergens during breast-feeding contributed to the sensitization of FCS, gelatin, or casein. On the other hand, in other dogs that showed allergic reactions after several vaccinations, it is unclear whether these dogs had been sensitized to FCS, gelatin, or casein by previous vaccination or other routes.
