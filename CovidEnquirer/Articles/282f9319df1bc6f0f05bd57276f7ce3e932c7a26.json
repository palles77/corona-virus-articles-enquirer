Microcantilevers translate the molecular recognition of biomolecules into a nanomechanical motion that is commonly coupled to an optical read-out system. A rectangular beam, clamped at one end, is the most used transducer as it is the simplest mechanical structure that can be easily batch-fabricated at micrometer scale . Microcantilevers can be fabricated in arrays of ten to thousands, and for that reason, they are a promising alternative to current biochips as they could permit the parallel, fast, and real-time monitoring of thousands of analytes (proteins, pathogens, DNA strands, etc.) without the need for labeling (Baller and Fritz, 2004) .",

The cantilever deformation depends mainly on the forces involved in the bioreaction process and is not directly related to the receptor-ligand binding energy. These forces could arise from the bond strength between the receptor and the surface (lineal response) and from the intermolecular interactions between neighboring molecules (non-lineal response). Although the factors and phenomena responsible for this change are still not fully understood, forces coming from electrostatic, steric, and van der Waals interactions, changes in the surface hydrophobicity or conformational changes of the adsorbed molecules could play an important role (Hagan et al., 2002) .",

The quality factor in liquids could be up to 100-fold lower than in air, reducing the frequency resolution. There are different ways to overcome this limitation: by fabricating cantilevers with higher resonance frequency and quality factors, by measuring the resonance frequency in air under controlled humidity before and after the biochemical recognition, by working with higher order vibration modes, or by using external excitations, among others. For the above reasons, this way of operation is more difficult to implement and most of the cantilever biosensors are based on the static mode.",

In general, they are made of silicon, silicon nitride, polymers, or piezoelectric materials. The microcantilever properties and sensitivity are determined by the cantilever dimensions and material (Young's modulus and Poisson coefficient). The selection of the appropriate characteristics depends on the working detection method (static or dynamic), the final application, and the available fabrication technology. In general, smaller spring constants give softer cantilevers, which are more sensitive to bending. Making thinner and longer cantilevers could improve the sensitivity, but they are also more fragile and therefore more difficult to handle. In addition, the thermomechanical noise increases.",

Light from the cantilever is injected into the output waveguide, called the \"receptor,\" separated from the free end of the cantilever by a short gap (see Figure 10 .3). Both the cantilever and the receptor are total internal reflection waveguides. If the gap is in the order of several microns, the energy transmitted into the receptor changes dramatically with the displacement of the cantilever's free end. The idea is to monitor the changes in the power transmitted into the output waveguide in order to register the deflection of the cantilever caused by any biomolecular interaction occurring on its surface. The device presented by Zinoviev et al. (2006a) was fabricated using standard silicon technologies. To obtain a straight cantilever free end aligned with the output waveguide, with precision better than 1 ~m, a thermally grown silicon oxide film was used. The input waveguide used for delivering the light into the cantilever should be made out of high temperature low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) silicon nitride because the silica layer cannot work as an optical waveguide on the silicon substrate, due to its lower refractive index. If the input waveguide is fabricated thin enough and utilizes a taper, all the energy can be transmitted into the cantilever, due to the large evanescent field tail of the waveguide mode propagating along the silicon nitride layer.

The efficiency of biomolecule attachment, the accessibility to its targets, and the degree of non-specific binding have to be taken into account. The immobilization process should avoid any change in the biological properties of the receptors, but, at the same time, must keep the chemical and physical properties of the cantilever as uniform as possible in order to generate a large surface stress. The current interest in nanometer-sized cantilever is demanding new immobilization techniques for the manipulation at nanometer scales; newer strategies from synthetic chemistry will become essential for the manipulation of biosensor surfaces and subsequent assembly of receptors. Controlled chemical functionality can be accomplished using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The strong affinity of sulphur compounds (thiols, thioethers, and disulfides) for gold and other noble metals make them excellent candidates for nanomechanical biosensing (Nuzzo and Allara, 1983; Ferretti et al., 2000) , since the cantilever surface usually has one surface coated with a thin layer of gold (20-100 nm) to increase reflectance of the laser beam. The immobilization of both DNA and proteins on gold surfaces using thiol-SAMs has become the most widely employed method.",

Thus, the appropriate immobilization procedure must be chosen in order to avoid inactivation or a decrease in the activity of the protein receptor. Several strategies could be employed which have already been useful in many other analytical systems, such as surface plasmon resonance (Boozer et al., 2004) , QCM (Mannelli et al., 2005) , or electrochemical measurements (Hianik et al., 2001) . A very interesting one is to covalently immobilize carboxylate-terminated alkanethiols onto the gold surface, followed by the esterification of the carboxylic groups with 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Staros et al., 1986; Grabarek and Gergely, 1990; Patel et al., 1997) . Another alternative is using a cystamine modified with glutaraldehyde and the subsequent attachment of the protein through an amine group Pavlov et al., 2004) . In addition, we can immobilize biotinylated proteins on avidin monolayers previously attached to the surface using EDC or cystamine chemistry. The immobilization procedure developed by Park and Kim employs the reaction of sulfosuccinimidyl 6-[3-(2-pyridyldithio)pro-pionamido] hexanoate (sulfo-LC-SPDP) with the protein NHz-groups to give amide linkages. The subsequent addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) reduces the disulfide to give a thiol, which finally self assembles onto the gold surface (Park et al., 2002) . Alternatively, a protein, such as antibody, protein A, or avidin, can be thiolated, with the thiol group subsequently used for immobilization on the metal surface; however, there is a high risk of denaturing the protein and therefore losing its biological function (Pyun et al., 2005) .",

Herne and coworkers demonstrated that a mixed-layer with mercaptohexanol enhanced the hybridization rate and minimized the physical adsorption of DNA probes on gold surfaces by eliminating the weaker adsorptive contacts between the nucleotide chain and gold. In this way, the majority of the immobilized DNA probes are accessible for hybridization with the Cantilever biosensors 431 complementary strand.

Frequently used silicon modifications, such as aldehyde activation or coating with poly-lysine or nitrocellulose, are typical for the biomolecule attachment (MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000) . The highly reactive epoxysilane surface, for example, reacts not only with amino groups, but also with other nucleophilic moieties on protein surfaces like alcohol, thiol, and acid groups, exhibiting a high binding capacity (Zhu et al., 2001) . Other methods employ amine-terminal silanes such as aminopropyl-triethoxysilane to provide a reactive amine group at the nitride surface. Thus, alkylamine coupling using glutaraldehyde is simple and fast, giving an aldehyde derivative that can form an imine linkage with primary amines on the protein (Williams and Blanch, 1994). The direct immobilization via thiol-terminal silanes is also a well-known methodology. Using crosslinkers such as EDC and NHS, it is possible to control the directional immobilization with more than 90% of specific binding to the surface (Shriver-Lake et al., 1997).",

The core of the dispensing head consists of a glass capillary which is surrounded by a tubular piezo actuator. At one end, the capillary forms a nozzle. By applying a voltage pulse, the piezo actuator creates a pressure wave which propagates through the glass into the liquid. This platform has been used for uniform deposition of thiolated DNA and others alkenothiols (Bietsch et al., 2004) . The Nanojet technology, also from Microdrop (www.microdrop.com), forms a liquid jet by means of a dispenser system controlled by time and pressure. Provided that the micro valve switches at a very fast rate, volumes down to 200 nl can be dispensed. Moreover, a combination of the Autodrop and Nanojet systems, called \"Dropjet,\" is also available, allowing the generation of a large number of drops with well-defined size (www.microdrop.com).",

In the following years, the concept of a device able to provide a direct conversion between the chemical stimulus and the mechanical energy was developed, focusing attention on miniaturized devices (Kuhn et al., 1950; Steinberg et al., 1966) . At the end of 1960s, some integrated miniaturized devices were developed (Newell, 1968; Newell et al., 1968) . However, the idea of fabricating floating structures was given up due to the microelectronics fabrication limitations at that time. As early as 1986, with the appearance of AFM (Binnig et al., 1986) and improvements in microelectronic technology, micro-mechanical transducers started to be used routinely and mass production at low cost was possible. Atomic force microscopy arose as a surface characterization technique, in air and subsequently in liquid, measuring the cantilever deflection induced by the interaction between a tip placed at its free end and the surface of the sample. Expansion of AFM techniques showed the microcantilever sensitivity for measuring intermolecular forces between two complementary biological molecules (Force Spectroscopy), such as the interaction between proteins (avidin~iotin) (Lee et al., 1994) , hybridization between complementary single-stranded DNAs (Lee et al., 1994) , or antigen-antibody interactions (Dammer et al., 1996) .",

            "text": "The sensitivity of microcantilevers for measuring intermolecular forces, the commercial availability of cantilevers, and their fabrication using standard microelectronic technology resulted, around 1994, in a new type of sensor where the transducer system is based on a silicon microcantilever with a tipless free end (Figure 10 .6) (Gimzewski et al., 1994; Chen et al., 1995) . Biochemical applications for this type of sensor have been specifically developed for bending-based modes of measurement, with an optical read-out, due to the complexity required for working with the dynamic mode in liquids. The first experiments in solution were focused on ion detection and measurement of changes in surface stress induced by changes in pH or ion concentrations. It was found that the cantilever response depended upon both pH and the ionic strength of the aqueous medium (Butt, 1996) . Among other biochemical applications, induction of surface stress by formation of SAMs Datskos and Sauers, 1999; Fritz et al., 2000b) or by non-specific adsorption of proteins such as BSA or lipoproteins has been studied (Moulin et al., 2000) . However, the largest growth in cantilever-based biosensor research has occurred after the landmark paper of Fritz et al. (2000a) , in which sensitive discrimination of single-base variations in DNA strands was demonstrated without using fluorescent labels. This paper had a wide impact and marked the beginning of a major research effort in this field. Shortly afterwards, microcantilever sensors were also employed to detect diverse biomolecular interactions. Several commercial platforms (Carrascosa et al., 2006) based on microcantilever array sensors are now available.",

Using this methodology, DNA hybridization has been sensed using DNA strands linked to the cantilever by gold-thiol covalent bonding and gold nanoparticle-modified probes. After hybridization, the gold nanoparticles act as a nucleating agent for the growth of silver particles, which leads to a detectable frequency shift by increasing the cantilever effective mass.

The interaction of biotin with streptavidin has been measured in liquids by working with higher cantilever resonance harmonics (Ghatkesar et al., 2004) . As an alternative, the integrated piezoelectric microcantilevers are becoming increasingly popular, showing quality factors one order of magnitude greater than thermal-driven cantilevers, allowing for mass virus detection in the femtogram range (5-10 fg) in air (Johnson et al., 2006) . A nanomechanical lead zirconium titanate or PZT thin film cantilever, composed of SiO2/TafPt/PZT/Pt/SiO 2 on a SiN~ supporting layer, was used for detection of different concentrations (1-100 ng/ml) of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in liquids (Hwang et al., 2004) .

These requirements have led to an increase in the development of integrated detection read-outs with a CMOS electric circuitry incorporated . In addition to an integrated read-out, the biotechnology field requires that biosensors be capable of working with small amounts of reagents, with highly reproducible surface functionalization and subsequent recognition processes. For this purpose, an integrated microfluidics system that allows liquid handling in an easy and reproducible approach is needed (Bietsch et al., 2004; Yue et al., 2004;  http://www.protiveris.com/ products/pages/sensorcartridge.html).",

Other techniques based on piezoresistive and piezoelectric microcantilevers allow an easy and more integrated readout and are becoming important during the past several years, although their sensitivities are presently inferior to those obtained with the optical method.",

Development of an integrated microfluidic system would be especially valuable for improving the signal reproducibility, reducing the volume required and the total system size. The possibility of working with several cantilevers at the same time, in completely independent microfluidics channels, would allow the detection, in real time, of many different reagents simultaneously, providing this sensor with a greater capability of measurement and higher versatility than other current techniques (such as ELISA or DNA microarrays).",
