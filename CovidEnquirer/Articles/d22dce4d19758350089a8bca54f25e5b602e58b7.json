The World Health Assembly produced a resolution to try to address the crisis at its May 2007 meeting. I examine how the parties to this controversy used international law in framing and negotiating the dispute. Specifi cally, I analyze Indonesia's use of the international legal principle of sovereignty and its appeal to rules on the protection of biological and genetic resources found in the Convention on Biological Diversity. In addition, I consider how the International Health Regulations 2005 applied to the controversy. The incident involving Indonesia's actions with virus samples illustrates both the importance and the limitations of international law in global health diplomacy.",

Indonesia's decision reportedly stemmed from its reaction to an Australian company's development of an avian infl uenza vaccine derived from a virus strain that Indonesia provided to WHO (3) . WHO's acknowledgment that patents had been sought on modifi ed versions of infl uenza (H5N1) samples shared through the Global Infl uenza Surveillance Network (GISN) without the consent of the countries that supplied the samples reinforced Indonesia's discontent. Indonesia argued that this incident exposed inequities in the global infl uenza surveillance system. Developing countries provided information and virus samples to the WHO-operated system; pharmaceutical companies in industrialized countries then obtained free access to such samples, exploited them, and patented the resulting products, which the developing countries could not afford. Avian infl uenza's spread and fears about pandemic infl uenza heightened this perceived inequity; experts argued that developing countries would have little access to vaccine for pandemic infl uenza without major changes in global vaccine production (4, 5) .",

Restarting sample sharing and improving vaccine access proved diffi cult and contentious. Before the WHA meeting in May 2007, negotiations between Indonesia and WHO did not produce agreement. For example, neither the Joint Statement issued by Indonesia and WHO in February 2007 (7) nor subsequent attempts to end the impasse succeeded (8) . Independent efforts to increase vaccines access, such as the agreement of the United States and Japan in March 2007 to provide $18 million to 6 developing countries (Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam) to facilitate the building of vaccine-manufacturing capacity and of a vaccine stockpile (9), did not alter the stand-off.",

This section analyzes how the stakeholders used international law to shape the debate. This incident illustrated the importance and limitations of international law in global health diplomacy. By withholding samples, Indonesia asserted sovereignty over them because they originated within its territory. Despite controversies surrounding it, the principle of sovereignty remains a central tenet of international law (12) . Traditionally, sovereignty holds that a state has authority and control over the people, resources, and activities within its territory (12) . International law supplements sovereignty with the rule prohibiting states from intervening in each other's domestic affairs (12) . Limits on sovereignty arise when the state agrees to follow rules of international law found in treaties or customary international law.",

            "text": "One reason Indonesia stressed the CBD is that it provided a way to fi nesse the implications of the revised IHRs adopted by WHA in May 2005 (IHR 2005) (19) , which provide that \"[t]he provisions of the IHR shall not affect the rights and obligations of any State Party deriving from other international agreements\" (article 57.1). Appeal to this rule begs the question raised by the fi rst sentence of article 57.1, which states that \"the IHR and other relevant international agreements should be interpreted so as to be compatible.\" Thus, interpreting IHR 2005 became important in the controversy over infl uenza virus (H5N1) sharing. IHR 2005 is a treaty, \"an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law\" (20 (21)-demonstrate that Indonesia could be considered in violation of its duty to not defeat the object and purpose of IHR 2005 before its entry into force. This argument is supported by the claim that had IHR 2005 actually been in force, Indonesia would have violated its obligation to share samples. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan argued at the WHA meeting in May 2007 \"that countries that did not share avian infl uenza virus would fail the IHR\" (22) . Addressing the credibility of these legal claims requires interpreting what IHR 2005 mandates States Parties to disclose and share with WHO. At least 2 differing interpretations exist. The fi rst interpretation argues that IHR 2005 requires States Parties to share relevant biological samples as part of the duty to provide WHO with accurate and detailed public health information about all events that might constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Given that the spread of highly pathogenic infl uenza viruses is considered a PHEIC, the IHR 2005 mandates that States Parties provide WHO with samples for surveillance purposes without preconditions or expectations of benefi ts in return.",

This list refers to things that would fall within the ordinary meaning of \"information\" and contains nothing that could be considered biological samples, substances, or specimens. The absence of express reference to biological samples is particularly telling in light of the fact that WHO and its member states were, at the time IHR 2005 was being negotiated, aware of concerns about the failure of countries to share samples of pathogens of global concern (e.g., the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, the infl uenza [H5N1] virus) for surveillance and other purposes.",

Technically, IHR 2005 had no binding force under international law until it offi cially entered into force on June 15, 2007. Thus, IHR 2005 created no international legal obligations for Indonesia with respect to the withholding of samples in the period before the Regulations entered into force. However, IHR 2005's imminent entry into force made its substantive provisions relevant to the negotiations over Indonesia's position on virus sharing. Under international law, a state must refrain from acts that would defeat a treaty's object and purpose when the state has expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty, pending the treaty's entry into force (20). Indonesia had expressed its consent to be bound by IHR 2005 because it did not reject IHR 2005, or submit reservations to it, by the December 2006 deadline to do so. Thus, whether Indonesia's decision to withhold samples constituted an act that would defeat the object and purpose of the IHR 2005 became a relevant question.
