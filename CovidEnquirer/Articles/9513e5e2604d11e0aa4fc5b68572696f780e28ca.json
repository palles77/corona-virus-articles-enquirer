The corollary assertion of this principle is that, when potentially serious risks arise, measures must be taken to minimize that risk. It could therefore be argued that the PI of blood products represents the quintessence of the precautionary principle: almost all potential for transfusion-transmissible disease is eradicated often before the responsible agent is even recognized, let alone conclusively established as a risk to the health of the recipient.",

            "text": "Prevention of transfusion-transmitted infections has traditionally been accomplished by testing donors for infectious disease markers. This approach has certainly achieved some great successes in reducing the risk of blood transfusion. The risk of transfusion-acquired hepatitis, for example, has been reduced from nearly 30% to near zero through the combination of more restrictive donor selection and increasingly sensitive screening assays. 2 This reduction in risk, however, occurred over a period of decades, and during the interim, countless transfusion recipients were harmed. Hepatitis B virus, for example, was first recognized as a transfusion risk in 1940, but it was only in 1970 that blood donors could be effectively screened with the first-generation assays for the historical Australia antigen, now known as the hepatitis B surface antigen. This assay was quickly refined and, in combination with the adoption of an allvolunteer donor system, reduced the overall risk of transfusion-acquired HBV to less than 1%. Nevertheless, transfusion-acquired hepatitis of all causes continued to occur at an incidence of approximately 10% throughout the 1970s, primarily because of a disease identified syndromically in 1975 as non-A/non-B hepatitis. The adoption of surrogate assays for this disease (eg, elevated donor alanine aminotransferase levels), the exclusion of donors for behavioral risk factors, and the decreased volume of blood transfused all combined to decrease the incidence of transfusion-acquired hepatitis to around 4% by 1989. It was only with the introduction of a specific serologic assay in 1990 for what was then recognized as HCV that the incidence of transfusion-associated hepatitis fell to less than 0.5%. By that point, however, much damage had already been done. If one assumes that 3 million patients are transfused per year in the United States, then it follows that some 4.8 million people acquired transfusion-acquired hepatitis between 1970 and 1990. Most of these cases were HCV, a disease that carries an 80% risk of chronicity and a 20% risk of cirrhosis and which is now the leading etiologic cause of liver transplantation in North America.",

            "text": "The interval between recognition of a transfusion-transmissible disease and the implementation of measures to prevent it has, over time, shortened. Thus, whereas it took 30 years to introduce screening for HBV and 15 years for HCV, it was only 3 years between the recognition of HIV and the development of a donor screening test, and for WNV, the interval was only 1 year. Yet, there continue to be exceptions to this trend: donor testing for Chagas disease was first recommended in 2002 by the Blood Products Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration but is only being implemented 5 years later. Perhaps more importantly, there is often an earlier period of delay, during which a disease is not appreciated as posing a risk to recipients of blood transfusion or, indeed, to human health in general. The harm caused by such diseases has been called a \"fixed and inevitable property of transfusion practice.\" 3 Where do these diseases come from? Many are zoonotic in origin, their transition into significant human pathogens the result of primate viruses entering the food supply in Africa (eg, HIV) or a shifting geographic relationship between disease vectors and humans who then serve as incidental hosts (eg, WNV). Having largely safeguarded the blood supply against HIV and transfusion-transmitted hepatitis, the transfusion medicine community is confronted with an ever-growing list of new adversaries: malaria, dengue, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, borreliosis, human herpes virus 8, and Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease), to name just a few. Each of these is known to be pathogenic and to be transmissible by blood transfusion. Indeed, dengue fever may well emerge as the next true threat to the blood supply: it already causes approximately 100 million cases and 25 000 deaths around the world each year. Most cases of dengue fever are asymptomatic, with a median viremia of 5 days, and both the virus and its mosquito vector are expanding in global distribution. 4 On the other hand, the blood industry may initiate screening tests for dengue only to find itself confronted with a completely unanticipated threat from a different pathogen. The dilemma we face, therefore, is whether to wait and see which pathogens emerge as serious risks to the blood supply before taking action (in which case we inevitably consign thousands and perhaps millions of patients to infectious harm during the interim) or simply start testing donors for all potentially transmissible pathogens (which would be prohibitively expensive).",

Transfusion-transmitted WNV, for example, infected 23 people in the United States, including 16 with neurologic disease, before the implementation of a donor screening assay in 2003. 5 An estimated 3200 other patients experienced subclinical disease. None of these infections, however, occurred via fractionated plasma products, because of the prior implementation of a solvent/detergent (SD) method of PI by the plasma fractionation industry. It is sobering to contemplate how much harm could have been avoided had this additional safety measure been implemented in the early 1980s, when the hemophilia community was just beginning to be ravaged by HIV and HCV. Although SD treatment is not applicable to cellular blood products, such as RBCs and platelet concentrates, other processes that target nucleic acids (eg, amotosalen or riboflavin) are now available. In addition to blocking transmission of both known and unknown pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, spirochetes, and protozoa, PI may also prevent transfusion-associated graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) by disabling donor lymphocytes.",

Although PI invariably involves the addition of novel chemical substances to blood products, these substances are either benign (eg, riboflavin) or are subsequently removed, with residual levels far below established toxicity thresholds (eg, amotosalen [S-59]-treated platelets; the toxicity of residual S-303 [amustaline] in treated RBCs requires further investigation). The reduction in product yield that PI necessitates is generally modest (10%-20%) and consistent with other accepted product modifications such as cell washing or leukoreduction. The additional costs of PI are considerable, but so are the potential savings that may be subsequently realized via elimination of existing donor screening assays (eg, Chagas disease), product testing (eg, bacterial testing of platelets), and product modification (ie, irradiation). Future costs from new screening assays could also be avoided, as could the growing cost from the otherwise inexorable progression from mini-pool to single-unit nucleic acid testing (NAT). Finally, the additional layer of safety offered by PI might allow blood collection agencies to loosen donor exclusion criteria (eg, geographic exclusions for malaria) and thereby increase the size of the available blood supply.",

The goal should be a practicable multicomponent system that will maximize safety, maintain adequate product yield, and have acceptable toxicity. Accomplishing this in a reasonable period will require additional governmental funding, both to improve existing technologies and to develop new processes, particularly with regard to PI of RBCs. However, we must not make the perfect the enemy of the good. Until this idealized multicomponent system is a reality, existing pathogen reduction technologies should be implemented for platelets and transfusable plasma, an approach already undertaken in many parts of Europe. Taking this next step in North America will require an investment of resources and political willpower and, perhaps most importantly, a change in our collective mindset regarding the notion of acceptable risk. Pathogens in blood components may be intracellular or extracellular, and techniques to inactivate or remove them should not incur any significant biologic or chemical alterations upon the therapeutic product itself. Success is thus predicated on the existence of specific targets in the pathogens, which are absent in, or irrelevant to, the component's function.",

Methylene blue (MB) is a phenothiazine dye that, when added to an individual unit of plasma at 1 \u03bcmol/L and photodynamically activated by UV light at 590 nm, produces singlet oxygen. Deoxyribonucleic acid is damaged by dye intercalation with free radical roles in strand cross-linking, guanosine oxidation, and indirect depurination. 8 Like SD, the application of MB is restricted to plasma and is also limited in its PI abilities. However, the basis for these limitations is different. Red blood cell hemolysis can occur from the effect of reactive MB singlets on lipid and protein components of membranes. On the other hand, the capsids of nonenveloped viruses, and the membranes of bacteria, protozoa, or the infected leukocytes that persist after plasma freeze-thaw, may resist not only these perturbations but MB penetration itself.

INTERCEPT (Cerus Europe BV, Leusden, The Netherlands), an S-59 (amotosalen) system, has been tested in plasma as well as platelets.

Some S-303 may remain bound to proteins, on or within RBCs, and thus serve as an immunogen with respect to acquired or preformed antibodies of unclear significance.",

To be effective, these substances must have a high degree of lethality against the wide variety of living organisms that might contaminate a blood product, from viruses to simple eukaryotic parasites, while at the same time minimizing any collateral injury to the normal components of the blood product. Although SD treatment, which disrupts lipid membranes, is an option for plasma products, the only viable approach to achieving this selective toxicity in cellular blood products is to target nucleic acids. Several such technologies have been developed and have entered clinical trials. Most, such as MB, amotosalen, riboflavin, and thionine, require activation by light, whereas others may be activated by shifts in pH (eg, S-303) or are activated upon binding to the negatively charged phosphate groups present on nucleic acids (eg, PEN110). These products have demonstrated, to various degrees, a high degree of selective toxicity, in that they successfully inactivate a wide variety of transfusion-transmissible pathogens with minimal effect on the therapeutic potency of the blood product.

A modern toxicology test battery begins with pharmacokinetic studies and is followed by assessment of single-dose toxicity, repeated-dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. To detect all potential hazards, the dosages selected for study should range to high enough to induce generalized toxicity syndromes in test animals, such as weight loss and decreased food consumption. The combined results of these toxicity studies provides a comprehensive hazard assessment, which comprises all potential adverse effects at maximal tolerated doses and the dose-response relationship for these toxic effects. The comprehensive risk assessment is in turn weighed against an exposure assessment, which involves assumptions regarding the typical dose of the substance, the frequency with which it will be administered, and the expected duration of treatment. Ideally, the maximum safe dose determined by animal studies should have a 1000-fold safety margin: a 10-fold margin to account for extrapolation from animal to human physiology, another 10-fold margin to account for physiologic variation in humans, and another 10-fold margin again to account for variability in the detection of all toxicology end points.",

The dose threshold for acute toxicity from UV-A-activated amotosalen, for example, is 150 mg/kg in rats (mortality) and 30 mg/kg in dogs (central nervous system effects). These doses are 150 000 and 30 000 times higher, respectively, than what would be delivered in a typical dose of amotosalen-inactivated blood products. For other toxicities, however, the safety margin is below 1000. Reproductive toxicity (determined by histologic rather than functional assessment), for example, was demonstrated at a threshold of 0.35 mg/kg, or 350 times the expected clinical exposure. 16 The reproductive risk of PEN110 has also been found to have an appropriate safety margin. 18 It should be borne in mind that many widely used medications, such as acetaminophen, have safety margins of only 100-fold. It should also be noted that all PI substances are water soluble and rapidly excreted, and therefore, the trace amounts infused in treated blood products will not bioaccumulate. The pharmacokinetic characterization of amotosalen has been published. 20 Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity are particularly important concerns with PI substances because these substances actively target nucleic acids and do not have any particular tissue specificity. Because carcinogenicity is now known to be caused by damage to nucleic acid, a battery of assays to measure chemical-induced DNA mutations have been established and are designated as genotoxicity assays. 17 For example, positive indicators of genotoxicity include induction of DNA repair in cultured rat hepatocytes (as manifested by unscheduled DNA synthesis); induction of mutations in bacteria such as the Ames assay (Salmonella base pair substitutions, frame shifts); and the induction of mutations in mammalian cell lines such as the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay. A positive result in these assays means not that the chemical is carcinogenic but that it does have an increased risk of causing cancer, and exposure assessments are particularly important. A negative result is strong assurance that the chemical is not carcinogenic.",

In a 70-kg patient, this dose would be equivalent to receiving nearly 40 000 U of PEN110treated RBCs per week. The carcinogenicity of a more typical human exposure can therefore only be calculated by extrapolating backwards from the doseresponse curve observed in experimental studies, and unsurprisingly, the degree of added risk is very small.

This substance has been demonstrated to be mutagenic, carcinogenic, and teratogenic in animal studies, and hypersensitivity reactions in patients undergoing hemodialysis have shown strong correlation with immune responses to the ETO used to sterilize dialysis device. Nevertheless, the US FDA is proposing to approve the use of ETO to sterilize the components of cord blood processing systems and storage containers, so long as the residue level does not exceed 5 mg per device. The residual quantity of amotosalen in treated platelets, in contrast, is 50 \u03bcg, whereas the residual concentration of PEN110 in treated RBCs is only 15 \u03bcg. The issues concerning ETO use as a sterilant for disposables processing stem cells has been reviewed. 21 In addition to the risks described, another type of toxicologic effect is the elicitation of an immune response to the PI blood product. This occurs because of the modification of macromolecules on the cell surface so as to create a new antigen (neoantigen). The elicitation of the immune response can result in the product of antibodies, which can bind to the blood cell product and cause them to be cleared from the circulation. During the conduct of a phase 3 trial, PEN110 was determined to have elicited such an immunologic response with PEN110-treated RBCs. As a result, the PEN110 technology has been put on hold until this technical issue can be resolved. A similar immunologic problem was observed with the S-303-treated RBCs, causing a delay in that product development effort; however, new trials with a modified S-303 process for RBCs are currently underway with this technology.",

The risk of transmission is further exacerbated by the fact that SD plasma batches are made from pools of up to 2500 individual donations; in the United States, 37 lots of SD plasma were voluntarily recalled because of parvovirus B19 contamination, although none of these cases involved clinical disease. In one phase 4 study, 18 of 77 volunteers seroconverted against parvovirus B19 after infusion of SD plasma, and it was found that all implicated lots had high levels of viremia (N10 7 GEq/L). Individual plasma donations in SD plasma batches are now checked for parvovirus B19 and HAV using NAT , with European Union regulations requiring that all lots with B19 viremia exceeding a considerably lower threshold of 10 4 GEq/L be discarded (approximately 1 in 800 lots will exceed this threshold for parvovirus B19). It should be noted in passing that, although SD treatment is less effective than other PI processes against bacteria or other cellular organisms, these pathogens are already eliminated in all plasma products via the physical processing that clears most cellular components and the freezethaw cycle that destroys whatever remains. Reports of bacterial contamination from plasma transfusion are for the most part attributable to contamination of the water baths used for thawing.",

For transfusion-transmissible diseases such as vCJD, in which the pathogenic agent can neither be tested for nor demonstrably eliminated by available PI technologies, the high number of donor exposures per transfusion from any pooled product is especially worrying. On the other hand, pooling also greatly dilutes the infectious load present in any single donation, possibly to levels below the minimal infectious dose, particularly if the pool also contains a neutralizing antibody. It is notable that with more than 6 million doses of SD plasma transfused worldwide, there has not been a single report of either transfusion-transmissible vCJD or transfusion-related acute lung injury (ALI) (TRALI) with this product. In the case of TRALI, the effect of pooling has been demonstrated to reduce the concentration of donor antileukocyte antibodies, thought to contribute to TRALI, to below the limits of detection. Pooling of plasma from donors of varying ABO groups, when performed in proper proportions, also allows for the production of universally ABOcompatible plasma. Additional precautionary steps available to blood collection agencies include the importation of plasma from North America (to avoid vCJD risks) and use of plasma from male donors (to avoid donations with a higher risk of containing antileukocyte antibodies.) The United Kingdom has recently adopted imported SD plasma as its PI plasma product of choice for patients with TTP despite the aversion toward the use of pooled products in the United Kingdom due to vCJD concerns.",

It must be acknowledged, however, that the evidence base for the efficacy of FFP is itself not very strong. In a recent systematic review of 58 trials that evaluated the efficacy of FFP, the only clinical indication found to be adequately supported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was TTP. For other standard indications, the evidence of efficacy of FFP was limited to either nonrandomized trials (massive transfusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation, reversal of coumarin, correction of congenital coagulation factor deficiencies) or expert opinion (neonatal hemorrhagic disease). Most of the trials identified were either small or had inadequate protections against bias. 35 Even with this caveat in mind, the evidence that PI plasma is therapeutically equivalent to FFP is not always convincing. Most of the published clinical studies on MB plasma are case reports or uncontrolled observational studies, and comparative studies on MB plasma vs FFP in healthy volunteers 36 or patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass 37 are too small and of insufficient methodological rigor to conclude therapeutic equivalence. Moreover, more recent studies comparing MB plasma and FFP in patients with TTP suggested that MB plasma may actually be less effective. [38] [39] [40] It is notable that the introduction of MB plasma in the Catalonia region of Spain in 1997 was followed by a dramatic increase in the ratio of plasma to RBC transfusions and was accompanied by growing demand for fibrinogen in the form of cryoprecipitate. 41 The implication of this observation is that MB plasma has reduced hemostatic quality, perhaps due to the 20% loss of fibrinogen that is observed after MB treatment of native plasma. 42 Experience elsewhere shows little difference between the use of FFP and MB plasma, 43 and the extensive experience with MB plasma in Europe would tend to support this observation. Although all licensed PI plasma products have approximately 20% to 30% less coagulation factor VIII than native plasma, this is unlikely to be clinically significant except in patients with congenital factor VIII deficiency.",

Although there have been several published RCTs and controlled observational studies suggesting equivalence with FFP, most of these studies were underpowered. 44 Postmarketing surveillance in the Republic of Ireland, where SD plasma was introduced in 2002, has not raised any concern regarding inadequate hemostasis in several high-risk populations such as women with obstetric or gynecologic emergencies, critically ill neonates, and patients with liver disease. 45 Although there is less clinical experience with amotosalen plasma than with the other 2 licensed pathogen-inactivated plasma products, the trials evaluating its clinical efficacy have been more rigorously designed. In one observational study, the transfusion of amotosalen plasma achieved incremental coagulation factor recoveries comparable with FFP, with the exception of fibrinogen, prothrombin, and factor XIII, and provided clinically effective hemostasis. A subsequent RCT of amotosalen plasma vs FFP in patients with acquired coagulopathy (predominantly patients with liver disease) showed noninferiority in the correction of the prothrombin time; although statistical noninferiority was not demonstrated in correction of the activated partial thromboplastin time, there was in fact a trend toward greater efficacy with amotosalen plasma, and no difference in clinical outcomes was observed. 46 In a separate RCT comparing amotosalen plasma with FFP for the treatment of TTP, no differences in clinical outcomes were observed, although the study was underpowered to prove noninferiority. 47 Cost If one only takes account of those viruses screened for by transfusion services, the marginal cost effectiveness of SD plasma, and probably PI plasma products in general, is astronomical (NUS$2 000 000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). For SD plasma, avoidance of TRALI may reduce this to acceptable levels (approximately US$100 000 per QALY). 48-50 For untested or emerging pathogens, there are theoretical benefits of PI plasma use, if testing can be avoided, but these are difficult to quantify.",

A number of clinical trials with INTERCEPT platelets have been completed in healthy subjects and thrombocytopenic patients in both Europe and the United States, with the largest number evaluated in the \"Transfusion of pooled buffy coat platelet components prepared with photochemical pathogen inactivation\" study (euroSPRITE) (phase 3 RCT, n = 103, 4 centers) 57 and the \"Therapeutic efficacy and safety of platelets treated with a photochemical process for pathogen inactivation\" study (SPRINT) (phase 3 RCT, n = 645), 56 respectively. The primary end point of 1-hour count increments were comparable for equivalent doses of INTERCEPT and conventional buffy coat platelets (P = .53), and all secondary end points were similarly comparable (platelet transfusion refractoriness, acute transfusion reactions, intertransfusion intervals, RBC transfusion requirements, and hemorrhages). Analogous phase 3B evaluation in apheresis platelets, with and without PI, revealed similar primary and secondary end points once again. 58 The platelet concentrates obtained for the INTERCEPT Blood System, during either the apheresis platelet collections or whole bloodderived buffy coat platelets (in pools of 6), demand less than 10 minutes of hands-on time and permit same-day, overnight, or next-day processing. Inter-Sol platelet additive solution maximizes the divertible plasma yield from donors, with the hope that reduced plasma content in platelets may reduce transfusion reactions.

This is not unexpected given that human sera contain an amazing variety of antibodies to chemicals, 67 the presence of some of which are probably due to environmental exposure to these chemicals (eg, polyethylene glycol is present in a wide variety of foods and cosmetics); thus, the antibodies can be found in healthy donors and patients. Other antibodies are present because of inadvertent immunization with the chemical used in the PI process. This would involve the same mechanisms occurring in drug-induced immune reactions, that is, the antibody could be directed against the chemical/drug itself (eg, penicillininduced serology) or to a combination of the chemical and the RBC membrane. Two further possibilities are that (1) the chemical/drug may change the RBC membrane, creating a new antigen (neoantigen); or (2) the changed RBC membrane may adsorb proteins nonimmunologically, leading to a positive antiglobulin test (in vitro and possibly in vivo). All of these mechanisms have been observed after PI processes, although the evidence for antibodies to neoantigens is slim. The finding of antibodies due to this phenomena (eg, naturally occurring antibodies to chemicals, drug-induced antibodies, or immune response to chemicals used in PI) does not necessarily mean that decreased RBC survival will occur.

As a result, a modified process to reduce S-303 binding on the RBC surface was developed by the company.

In the Quebec experience, 30% of hemolytic reactions were due to ABO incompatibility with the balance due to alloimmune or autoimmune hemolysis. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions commonly result from antibodies that were previously identified but which are no longer reactive in the pretransfusion specimen. Preventing such reactions depends upon retrieval of data from patient blood bank records. Because patients receive health care at multiple hospitals, sharing data regarding prior sensitization to blood groups between hospitals would be expected to reduce the rate of hemolytic reactions. This strategy was put to the test in Quebec, where all hospital blood banks were given access to a common database of patient records during the period from 2003 to 2005. Importantly, the incidence of both acute and delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions significantly decreased after implementation of this online interhospital database. Reactions were cut by more than 50% at a cost of approximately $6 per RBC (or $3 per component) transfused (P. Robillard, personal communication, 2007). Centralized data registries such as this could also store data obtained from high-throughput gene chip technologies applied to donor and recipient antigen typing. 76 Such prospective matching may further decrease hemolytic events by reducing rates of alloimmunization to RBC antigens.",

Phase 3 clinical trials should be conducted to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of PI-treated products in a patient population requiring repeated transfusions of these products with functional end points (ie, control of hemostasis in trials assessing platelet products and oxygen delivery in trials assessing RBCs) as well as transfusion end points (ie, frequency of transfusions and transfusion increments).",

Because transfusion products will be infused into patients who have significant underlying disease, there is potential for a different toxicity profile. In addition to the mentioned toxicity studies, the PR processes should also be evaluated in models that mimic the physiologic stresses induced by various clinical situations. One example would be an animal model of plateletmediated organ toxicity, the ALI murine model. 79 In this model, platelets mediate the pathophysiology of acid-or septicemia-induced ALI by anchoring neutrophils to lung endothelial cells. Platelet Pselectin mediates neutrophil accumulation in the lung, with the hypothesis being that platelets expressing more P-selectin could support more neutrophil accumulation in lungs and exacerbate ALI symptoms. A hypothetical clinical scenario that reflects this mechanism could apply to an immunosuppressed thrombocytopenic patient who develops sepsis and mild ALI. Some PI-treated platelets have higher Pselectin expression than control platelets, and in this setting, infusion of PI-treated platelets could exacerbate the ALI symptoms. Examples of other such models that implicate platelets in pathophysiology of disease include mouse models of allergic pneumonitis 80 and ischemia-reperfusion models. 81 After preclinical trials, clinical trials should monitor all adverse events to identify unexpected toxicities and evaluate immune response for antibody development.

Available data indicate that PI platelets are activated with increased P-selectin expression and damaged with decreased recovery and survival. Currently available animal models present a plausible mechanism that involves activated platelets in the mediation of respiratory adverse events similar to those seen in a large clinical trial with PI-treated platelets. 84 Until further elucidated, the current safety profile of PI-treated RBC and platelet products argues against justifying ageneral clinical use oftheproducts at this time.

The peer-reviewed, published evidence for SD FFP highlights the challenges in conducting meaningful economic analyses of PI. A 1994 publication estimated a cost effectiveness of US $289 000 per QALY, but a 1999 update of this same analysis using more recent estimates of the risk transmission of HIV, HCV, and HBV coupled with a 5-times-higher estimate of the cost of the technology generated a result of $9.7 million per QALY for the US setting. 48,93 A 1999 study from Spain evaluating a similar SD technology had a cost effectiveness of US $2.2 million per QALY. 49 These studies focused on the risk of transmitting viral infections with and without SD treatment. However, a recent study from the United Kingdom included the noninfectious threat of TRALI. Under the assumption that the SD treatment and component manufacturing processes can reduce the risk of TRALI, the cost effectiveness of SD FFP improved to \u00a323 000 to \u00a399 000 per QALY (US $45 000-$194 000 per QALY). 94 Psoralen light treatment (INTERCEPT) for single-donor apheresis (AP) and random-donor (RD) platelets has the largest body of available economic evidence. An analysis conducted for the US setting predated current bacterial culture. Results were reported for 4 different patient groups (pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia, hip 24 WEBERT ET AL arthroplasty, coronary artery bypass grafts, and adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and with and without bacterial culture. Depending on the patient population, baseline results ranged from US $4.8 million to $23.0 million per QALY with bacterial culture and US $1.3 million to $4.5 million per QALY without bacterial culture for AP platelets. 95 There are limitations to the evidence generated by cost-effectiveness studies, and future analyses will need to take these factors into consideration. Studies should compare each technology with all interventions in place in a given setting. Studies should be based on infectious threats reduced or inactivated by each technology including analyses on known emerging agents such as chikungunya virus in Reunion Island as opposed to unknown emerging agents. Noninfectious threats may hold potential to be incorporated into economic analyses, but clear evidence of the effectiveness of PI in reducing these threats will first need to be established. The measure of increased product use resulting from the loss of component therapeutic activity from PI will also need to be considered.",

The problem of hemolysis after virucidal photoinactivation of RBC suspensions using these agents has been a common theme reported in several laboratories. This theoretically may be minimized through the use of dyes such as MB and dimethylene blue, which bind strongly to nucleic acids. This provides a basis for specificity because pathogens, unlike RBCs, contain genomic nucleic acid. Hemolysis upon illumination with these compounds may occur by several mechanisms: (1) freely floating dye near RBCs produces singlet oxygen when illuminated, which results in RBC damage; (2) many nucleic acid binding dyes also bind to the RBC membrane, resulting in photo-induced hemolysis.

            "text": "Development of flexible photosensitizers. In general, photosensitizing dyes are rigid, planar aromatic compounds that are activated by light whether free in solution or bound to a substrate. However, the structure of some sensitizers permits separated aromatic ring systems to rotate about adjoining covalent linkages of partial single-bond character when they are not rigidly bound to substrate. This rotation permits the energy from absorbed light to be dissipated as heat through bond rotation. However, once these dyes are intercalated into nucleic acids, they become rigid photosensitizers. The discovery of flexible dyes has allowed the development of RBC cell inactivation systems that are more specific for pathogens and that do not cause excessive RBC cell damage. The first example of a flexible photosensitizer used for RBC cell decontamination was a nucleic acid staining dye, thiopyrylium (TP). Because TP bound to RBCs cells in addition to nucleic acids, a second substance, dipyridamole, a commonly used vasodilator drug, and also an antioxidant, may be added to inhibit binding and photodamage to RBC membranes. Thiopyrylium phototreatment of RBC suspensions containing 200 \u03bcmol/L dipyridamole with 1.1 J/cm 2 of red light resulted in robust inactivation of a number of intracellular and extracellular viruses as well as bacteria and parasites. 64,102 After storage for 42 days, the RBCs exhibited acceptable levels of hemolysis, morphology scores, extracellular pH, ATP, glucose use rates, and lactate production. However, treated samples exhibited substantially increased potassium efflux compared with controls, and day 42 ATP levels were significantly different from controls. 64 Autologous infusion of fresh TP-phototreated canine RBCs cells resulted in comparable 24-hour recovery and survival as untreated fresh canine RBCs. 103 One disadvantage of the TP system is the requirement for the presence of a second drug, dipyridamole, to limit RBC photodamage because any commercial development of the system would require toxicological investigation of TP, dipyridamole, as well as the combination of the 2 drugs. This would likely make it very difficult to get such a system approved by a regulatory agency. The identification of a flexible dye that binds poorly to RBCs may make the addition of a competitive inhibitor unnecessary. One such a dye, thiazole orange, a nucleic acid-intercalating dye that has been used as a stain to identify reticulocytes and malaria-infected RBCs, has showed promise as a photosensitizer for RBC decontamination without the need for a second drug because thiazole orange binds to RBCs less than TP. Treatment of RBC suspensions with 80 \u03bcmol/L thiazole orange and up to 7.9 J/cm 2 cool white light also resulted in robust inactivation of intracellular and extracellular viruses (6 to 8 logs). 104 Bacteria were photoinactivated with thiazole orange to differing extents depending on the species, but at least 2.3 logs, and for some species, more than 7 logs of bacteria were inactivated. 104 The discussion opened with a question about the utility of this emerging technology (PI) for the prevention of transfusion-related infections in the developing world. It was acknowledged that PI technology in its present form is expensive and could not be implemented in many less developed regions of the world at this time. There was optimism, however, that with refinement, PI technologies could eventually have a major impact on the prevention of transfusion-transmissible infections in less financially capable nations. This was seen as a significant impetus to the continued need for the development of PI technology. An additional point made was that it was likely not feasible to continue to introduce additional tests for every emerging pathogen. The finite resources available to ensure transfusion safety precluded such an approach because the costs of introducing additional tests for emerging pathogens would be considerable. It was suggested that a cost-effectiveness model would be invaluable for assessing the impact of new technologies in the context of the resources available, particularly in disadvantaged countries.",

It was thus suggested that PI should, therefore, not be pursued without adequate public consultation as well as the introduction of active surveillance. The latter must involve the follow-up of large cohorts of transfusion recipients. Many surveillance systems currently in place are voluntary and passive in approach. Surveillance of potential complications arising from 28 WEBERT ET AL the widespread introduction of PI technology must be active and must also have regulatory oversight. In addition, such surveillance must be long term, following recipients for many years. There was considerable discussion around the level of informed consent necessary for postmarketing surveillance. It was pointed out that precedents exist in some countries, such as Canada, where active surveillance for severe adverse reactions to vaccinations is carried out without the requirement for specific informed consent. Another ethical consideration raised concerned the approach to be taken in the event that universal implementation of PI technologies is not feasible. Ideally, a universal approach to implementation of PI should be pursued; however, with the limitations of currently proposed PI technology, a universal approach to PI of all blood components would probably not be possible at this time. For example, obstacles to the PI of RBCs remain substantial. Under these circumstances, implementation of PI technology would likely result in 2 levels of safety for the different blood components, and the attendant needs to continue to perform microbiological screening of RBC components. If universal implementation of PI for all blood components were not possible, the ethical considerations of selective implementation of PI technology would have to be addressed, including issues relating to varying the levels of the safety of blood products and the need for explicit informed consent by the patient receiving the PI products. For example, would it be appropriate to offer PI-treated products to the pediatric population exclusively, similar to the approach taken in the United Kingdom with the transfusion of MB-treated plasma to persons younger than 16 years? Similar concerns could arise during the crossover from the existing inventory to a PI inventory. Moreover, if significant differences were known to exist between PI and non-PI products, this could become an important element of informed consent for transfusion. It was also pointed out that policy makers must retain flexibility in making decisions with respect to the appropriate allocation of limited resources if a universal approach to PI is not attainable.",

It was further suggested that the requirements for the testing of a new technology have become so detailed as to be counterproductive to the rational assessment of new approaches to transfusion safety. It was recommended that the regulators clearly define what data might be required for licensure of a new technology. In the past, manufacturers were required to develop the concept and move it through the regulatory process to bring new technology to the market. This was felt to be a time-consuming and laborious approach, which has become cost prohibitive based on the sophistication of newer technologies under development.

American Red Cross Blood Services, Southern California Region, University of California, Los Angeles, CA In 2000, Lublin 65 wrote an editorial in Transfusion concerning various efforts to modulate the RBC membrane to produce safer transfusion products. 65 These included the following: (1) converting group A, B, and AB donor RBCs to group O by treating RBCs with specific enzymes, in vitro, to remove the immunodominant A and B sugar, yielding group O RBCs (ECO RBCs) 66 ; (2) bonding polyethylene glycol to the RBC membrane to block all RBC antigens, creating \"stealth RBCs\" that would not be antigenic or immunogenic 66 ; and (3) PI of leukoreduced RBCs. Lublin used a cartoon showing a conveyer belt making leukoreduced ECO-pegylated PI RBCs. He projected this would be happening in blood centers in 2005. So far (in 2007)",
