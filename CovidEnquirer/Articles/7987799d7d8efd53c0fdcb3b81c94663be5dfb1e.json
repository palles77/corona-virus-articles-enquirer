            "text": "Although the need for global health curricular content is increasingly recognized, there has been a paucity of research examining the development of global health content for medical curricula. 5 In general, the literature reflects a fragmented and insufficient response on the part of medical schools to the increased student demand for global health content. 6, 7 Much of the literature to date regarding global health medical education focuses on international electives or activities at individual medical schools. 8, 9 A survey of global health training in Canadian medical schools in 2006 found that global health content was haphazard and lacking in uniform objectives or guidelines. 5 The lack of coordination in curricular development has resulted in wide variations between medical schools in the type, quantity, and quality of global health content offered. Where global health components are provided, there are variations in the format and content of global health materials, the year in which it is taught, whether the courses are required or elective, and whether they are didactic or experiential. 5 While variations in educational approaches are an important source of innovation, the lack of consensus that characterizes contemporary global health training may have detrimental consequences. In the absence of formal learning opportunities, medical students are pursuing their own programs and electives in global health, often with little or no faculty oversight. 5 This situation presents the risk of students practicing beyond their competency level, which may lead to harm for patients, themselves, and the educational and clinical institutions in which they study. 10 Beyond the clinical aspects, medical graduates lacking appropriate global health training will be unprepared to recognize and meet the challenges of an increasingly interdependent world and the needs of the patients and populations they will serve. 3 Coordinating the development of medical education systems for a new global context of medical care requires a systematic approach supported by key organizations and accreditation bodies. 5 The lack of consensus among schools and leaders regarding what constitutes fundamental elements in global health training must be addressed in order to counter the fragmentation and inconsistency of current pedagogical approaches. 3, 5 One step in this process is to seek consensus regarding the core competencies that all medical students, regardless of their interest in global health, should possess before graduating. Although particular themes have been identified in the literature, 7,11 a common set of criteria will help to ensure that all medical students receive appropriate and comparable global health training.",

This review identified 32 relevant articles; 11 retrieved articles described curricular competencies including the global burden of disease, travel medicine, health care disparities between countries, immigrant health, primary care within diverse cultural settings, and skills to better interface with different populations, cultures, and health care systems. Whereas each of these topics was mentioned in more than 1 article, no single topic was discussed in more than 5 of the reviewed articles, suggesting a lack of consensus within the literature regarding the essential global health competencies for medical students. The review also highlighted variations in the educational approaches used to teach these competencies.",

This training includes competency in cross-cultural communication and interactions. In 2004, 763 million people crossed international borders. 12 Each year, up to 8% of travelers seek health care while abroad or upon returning home. 13 Although travel medicine has emerged to accommodate the need for expertise in providing pre-travel and post-travel advice, 14 all physicians should know how to take a basic travel history and when to refer or treat individuals with possible travel-related illnesses. Health professionals also require some understanding of how the global economy and travel contribute to the spread of communicable diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. These experiences demonstrate the undeniable link between global and domestic health systems, the need for training in public health practice, and the need to better comprehend the medical risks of an interconnected world.",

These barriers may include inadequate local health system infrastructures; poor public infrastructure such as roads, schools, and telecommunications; cultural and linguistic barriers; low literacy rates; lack of health insurance; costs of medicines and therapies; advanced presentation of disease; lack of provider access to continuing education; and underutilization of available resources. Medical students should be aware of the realities of health care delivery in resource-poor settings and standards of clinical appropriateness in different environments. Further, students who travel abroad to participate in elective programs in low-resource settings should receive appropriate specialized orientation and training.

As a new field, faculties and schools may benefit from resources and guidance to develop global health modules and teaching materials. The GHEC/AFMC GHRG core competencies project was undertaken with the goal of providing guidance for those programs interested in adding global health content to their curricula. In addition, it is hoped that these recommendations will stimulate discussion among medical educators, students, professional educational organizations, and accreditation bodies regarding global health training in medical education to facilitate consensus on necessary competencies for students. Through the use of the proposed set of core competencies established by this project, it is hoped that this model will be shared among medical educators and programs in an effort to build a coordinated approach to global health in medical education.",
