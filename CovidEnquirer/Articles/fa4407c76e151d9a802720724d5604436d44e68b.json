[6] on samples from 13 outbreak cases found the virus to be associated with a novel recombinant clade that predominated in Saudi Arabia in 2015 [7] and was exported to South Korea and China [8] . Importantly, genetic analysis also revealed 2 unique mutations resulting from substantial deletion events-a 48-nucleotide (nt) in-frame deletion in accessory open reading frame (ORF) 4a present in sequences from 13 outbreak cases and an additional 9-nt in-frame deletion in ORF3 in a subset of case specimens collected later in the outbreak-leading the authors to conclude that all cases were infected following a single introduction of the virus [6] . We conducted an investigation that included additional viral genome and serologic analysis to describe the transmission patterns and epidemiology of MERS-CoV deletion variants during the 2015 Jordan outbreak. We reviewed outbreak investigation records, conducted key informant interviews with clinicians and infection control staff at the affected hospitals, and reviewed medical charts of confirmed cases. A confirmed MERS case met the World Health Organization case definition [9] and was laboratory-confirmed at the Jordan Central Public Health Laboratory using MERS-CoV N2 and/or N3 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays [10] . A case was considered health care-associated if they were a patient, visitor, or health care personnel (HCP) at a health care facility during the 14 days before symptom onset (exposure period), and if exposure to a known MERS case occurred exclusively in this setting [11] .",

The 2 cases with the earliest dates of illness onset (cases 1 and 2) were both present at the same coronary care unit (CCU) in hospital A on a single day (case 1 as a patient and case 2 as a visitor); however, no direct contact was documented between them. Before the 2015 outbreak involving the MERS-CoV deletion variants, the last identified MERS case in Jordan had been 8 months earlier, in December 2014. In the 2015 outbreak, cases 1 and 2 had both recently traveled to Jordan from locations on the Arabian Peninsula (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait City, Kuwait, respectively). Interestingly, viruses genetically similar to the viruses detected in cases 1 and 2 in Jordan, but without deletions, were concurrently circulating in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the period corresponding to the earliest cases in Jordan (August 2015) [15] . Neither case 1 nor case 2 reported contact with a known MERS-CoV patient, camels, or a health care setting outside of Jordan during their exposure period. A review of previous CCU admissions did not reveal other likely index case candidates. Genome sequence analysis could not definitively identify the antecedent virus. Despite an extensive investigation, epidemiologic evidence did not definitively determine which of these 2 cases may have been the index case. Subsequently, 3 patients (cases 3, 5, and 6) and 1 visitor (case 8) at hospital A were identified as cases. Cases 5 and 6 had been admitted in the CCU at hospital A MERS before symptom onset. No cases were identified among HCP at hospital A, including from the CCU.

Although all outbreak specimens exhibited the ORF4a deletion, an additional deletion in ORF3, which was observed later in the outbreak first reported by Lamers et al. [6] , was predominantly associated with a cluster at a single hospital. Additionally, we observed transmission of a unique 726nt deletion spanning ORF4b and ORF5 between a husband and wife as well as detection of multiple other deletion variants within the same hosts. The overall epidemiology of this outbreak, including prominent transmission among health care contacts, a less pronounced role of household transmission, a high case fatality rate (44%), presence of comorbidities among fatal cases, and retrospective evidence of asymptomatic infections, is all consistent with previous descriptions of hospital outbreaks, despite the distinctive genomic variation we observed [17, 18] . The genomic variability of this MERS-CoV deletion virus and the accumulation of genetic mutations observed as the outbreak continued, as well as information from other recent reports [19, 20] , highlight the critical importance of ongoing contemporaneous molecular and epidemiologic surveillance for the persistent emergence of MERS-CoV. This outbreak was unique in having many deletions detected from multiple patients, the accumulation of deletion mutations over time, and that these deletion variants retained transmissibility and virulence. The observed deletion mutations allowed us to link all outbreak patients to a single originating virus (ORF4a) and revealed some degree of transmission directionality in the outbreak. We observed multiple deletion mutations of varying size mostly distributed among accessory ORFs of the Jordan outbreak viruses. Deletion variants of MERS-CoV present as mixed infections with wild-type virus involving the ORF5, and E protein genes [20] and spike protein gene [19] have been previously reported from patients.",

            "text": "MERS-CoV has 5 group-specific ORFs (3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 8b) that encode accessory proteins whose functions are not fully characterized [21] . Although certain ORFs have been shown to be nonessential for virus replication in vitro [22] , evidence exists that they may play a role in modulation of the host innate immune response [23] [24] [25] . For example, ORF 4a, ORF 4b, and ORF 5 proteins have been shown to be potent interferon antagonists [23] . Using an ORF3-5 deleted MERS-CoV infectious clone, Baric et al. observed increased stimulation of the interferon response in vitro and reduced viral replication and pathogenesis in a mouse model, compared with a wild-type virus [26] . Although deletions in accessory ORFs hypothetically could modulate the host response during infection, no apparent changes in pathogenicity were observed during our investigation; variant viruses with deletions in ORF 4a, ORFs 3, and 4a, and ORFs 4a, 4b, 5 each resulted in symptomatic illness and death in some cases. The ORF 4a deletion we observed is in-frame and located within the dsRNA-binding domain. The impact on the functionality of the protein with the deletion is unknown and warrants future study. Notably, deletions in accessory ORFs were also observed in SARS-CoV after its introduction to human hosts, and viruses containing a specific ORF 8 deletion were predominant later in the SARS epidemic [25, 27] . Viral genomic changes may have arisen due to selective pressures exerted by the human host, or due to the lack of such pressures on genes that are required specifically for sustained replication in camels, as suggested by Lamers et al. [6] . The combination of serologic and epidemiologic data improved our understanding of viral transmission patterns, including a seropositive HCP that may have been the link between 2 patient cases. We found that the majority of seropositive or indeterminate HCP were either respiratory therapists or nurses, demonstrating risks for these occupations in outbreak settings [28] . We also identified a nonclinical HCP (radiology clerk) who was seropositive. Infection among nonclinical HCP has been less commonly reported; however, these findings highlight the importance of including nonclinical HCP in contact tracing and monitoring efforts and the need to further evaluate specific health care activities associated with risk of MERS-CoV transmission.",

Conversely, we identified individuals who reported no symptoms and tested MERS-CoV negative during outbreak contact tracing but were subsequently seropositive. Several exposed individuals had detectable anti-MERS-CoV S-serum antibodies by ELISA, including 1 who exhibited acute respiratory symptoms but did not have detectable neutralizing serum antibodies (serologic result classified as indeterminate). These individuals may have developed anti-S antibodies to non-neutralizing epitopes, neutralizing antibodies may have decayed to below detectable levels at the time we collected the sera (~8 months after infection), or they may have never mounted robust antibody responses during the initial acute infection. The natural history of the immune response to MERS-CoV infection as related to disease severity needs further investigation. The role of mildly ill or asymptomatic individuals in transmission of MERS-CoV remains a particularly critical question in health care settings where patients with underlying conditions might be at increased risk for infection. Direct epidemiologic links between some health care-associated cases could not be established. In addition to potentially unrecognized human cases, indirect contact or fomite transmission in this outbreak also remains a possibility. Although contamination of environmental surfaces is a suspected mode of transmission for some respiratory viruses in certain settings [32] , this has not been confirmed as a route of transmission for MERS-CoV. Key informant interviews with hospital infection control officers and clinicians working during the outbreak, as well as hygienic observations during the investigation, suggest that patients admitted before MERS-CoV was recognized could have contaminated shared hospital equipment with transmissible virus (specifically, an x-ray table and portable echocardiogram machine). Viable MERS-CoV has been recovered from surfaces after 48 hours at 20\u00b0C and 40% relative humidity [33] , suggesting plausibility that MERS-CoV survives on indoor surfaces in a climate-controlled setting. Viral contamination of commonly handled surfaces in a hospital setting was reported during the 2015 South Korea outbreak [34, 35] . The importance of fomite transmission compared with other transmission routes in nosocomial outbreaks of MERS-CoV remains uncertain but could have important implications for infection prevention and control guidance.",

We did not capture all health care and household contacts in our seroepidemiologic investigation, and we are unable to assess whether those captured were similar to those not captured. An overall limitation of the MERS-CoV outbreak investigation is that RT-PCR testing of contacts might miss cases depending on the timing of nasopharyngeal swab swab collection.
