            "text": "A rapid, convenient and reliable pseudorabies virus (PRV) detection system was developed by using the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method. Six special primers were designed successfully based on the PRV DNA-binding protein (DBP) gene. The assay was optimized to amplify PRV DNA by incubation at 63 \u2022 C for 1 h. The LAMP products had a ladder-like pattern of bands from 188 bp when electrophoresed on an agarose gel and its specificity was confirmed by digestion with Hinc II enzyme. Two naked-eye detection methods were developed for use in the field. The detection limit of the LAMP assay was found to be 10 fg DNA sample which was 100-1000-fold higher than that of PCR. By using DNA (or cDNA) samples extracted from three different PRV strains and six other viruses known to be related genetically to PRV or to cause similar clinical signals in pig, the system was identified to amplify only the PRV DNA. A comparison between the LAMP and PCR assay using five clinical samples showed good correlation.",

This virus disease causes serious reduction to the pig industry and leads to severe financial loss, which requires a better detection system for improving the virus surveillance (Pejsak and Truszczy\u0144ski, 2006) . Traditionally, PRV detection is based on direct virus isolation (Pensaert and Kluge, 1989) or detection of antigens by an immunohistological method (Ducatelle et al., 1982) . However, both methods are time-consuming, requiring at least 2-3 days. PCR has allowed detection of the virus rapidly, but requiring precise instruments and an elaborate method for detection the amplified product (Osorio, 1991; Balasch et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2007) .",

Initial experiments were performed to optimize the assay conditions by using different concentration of MgSO 4 , dNTPs, primers, amplification temperature and reaction time. Among all factors analyzed, Mg 2+ had the greatest affect on LAMP; it is possible that Mg 2+ affects DNA polymerase activity and primer annealing (Saiki et al., 1998 ). The LAMP system developed in this study worked well during 60-65 \u2022 C, which would be useful for PRV detection in field practice when using a regular laboratory water bath. The results demonstrated that LAMP amplification products could be detected in 0.5 h, faster than PCR, so that diagnosis, including DNA extraction, amplification and product detection could be completed within 1 h after arrival of the samples. It could make the technique far more suitable for practice in the field.",

Positive amplification exhibited a green color while a negative reaction corresponded to an orange color (Dukes et al., 2006) . The two visual inspection of LAMP product (Fig. 3(B and C) ) are better detection methods as there is no need for gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide.

Six other viruses were used in the study to confirm the specificity of LAMP; the results showed no DNA amplification in all viruses used, which makes LAMP more attractive for PRV detection in the field. The high specificity of LAMP is most probably attributable to recognition of the target sequence by six independent sequences in the initial stage and by four independent sequences during the second reaction stage (Notomi et al., 2000) . A good correlation was obtained between the LAMP and PCR results when using five clinical samples collected from suspect cases of pseudorabies, which demonstrated the value in practice of LAMP.
