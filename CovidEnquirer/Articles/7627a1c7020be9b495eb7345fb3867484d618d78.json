What actually happened? As was typical of early telehealth projects in Africa, the project was faced with challenges related to procuring appropriate equipment and setting up infrastructure, as well as difficulties in achieving connectivity. Disappointingly, the project never actually made an online consultation between Kampala and the rural health centres, and it would be remiss to say that it resulted in any direct beneficial health outcomes for the rural population.",

The drop was explained by the following factors: \"Kiosk Operator's ability to administer the kit properly, acceptability by the villagers, identification of the Kiosk in a place where medical care is already dispensed, lack of awareness of the service, distance of the doctor from the village, and availability of competing services such as Registered Indian Medical Practitioners Primary Health Centres, local doctors, etc.\" 1 Although the project faced challenges with respect to sustainability, it was, contrary to the Ugandan experience, able to function as a working telemedicine project.

The pilot network consists of six medical stations within community health centres and a station for each referral hospital, health office and test laboratory. The pilot found that human resource capacity-building -in particular, training to facilitate the adoption of computer and telemedicine technology -required significantly more time than expected. The project therefore demonstrated the important role that human resource development plays in the sustainable implementation of ICT-based telemedicine systems. However, as before, no findings were documented on the actual effect the pilots had on people's health or on health systems. 2 What parameters were to be used for evaluating programs? Textbox 1 lists those factors that were felt to be relevant and important according to a report, commissioned by IDRC, that unfortunately ranked all projects \"low\" with respect to demonstrated health benefits. Common deficiencies included a lack of planning and health needs assessment, a need for sustainability planning, difficulty in the management of change, and a need for better evaluation, dissemination of findings, and knowledge transfer to influence policy-making. A comparison of respondents from the two countries showed, as expected, that most received information on antiretroviral treatment (ART) from traditional media. However, increased access to information technology in South Africa resulted in 30% of respondents receiving information from cellphones (versus 10% of respondents in Tanzania). Hence the assumption is that, as access to mobile telephony and the Internet rises in Africa, so will the number of people accessing health information through these technologies.",

They also pointed out that the use of \"modern\" ICTs is still very limited, but that there is huge potential; that because institutions and health workers remain reliant on \"conventional\" ICTs there is a need to integrate both \"modern\" and \"conventional\" to get the best results; and, perhaps most important, that changing perceptions and behaviours requires careful planning and patience.",

However, the prospectus also affirms that the first generation of largely donor-driven \"telemedicine\" projects has generally had only a marginal impact on people's health. Indeed, many of the technologies previously developed and tested were too expensive to be widely adopted in resource-poor settings. Much like Acacia, PAN sees the advent of more pervasive technologies, such as mobile phones and PDAs, as a new generation of health applications that have actually made a demonstrable difference. As mobile telephony use in Asia is more widespread than in Africa, it is clear that the potential for these types of applications is significant in Asia.",

However, the fast pace of innovation in both ICTs and health research means that there is also a need to develop, implement and evaluate new applications, particularly in the area of demographic surveillance of disease incidence and medical compliance, using new technologies such as mobile phones. According to the prospectus, another area that has recently come to the forefront in Asia is the issue of pandemics. First severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and now the potential for an Avian flu pandemic are perceived as serious threats to the health of Asian populations as well as the rest of the world. A key to mitigating the spread of these infectious diseases is to ensure that data on outbreaks are captured and communicated to the relevant experts in real time. ICTs can play a critical role in helping to prevent or control pandemics, although more research and experimentation need to be done to identify the most appropriate and cost-effective effective means of developing health communications processes in rural and remote areas, where many of these outbreaks start.",

ICTs and the Internet, for example, can bring to these communities (at low cost) contacts with larger health centres located in urban areas, opening access to health prevention measures, consultations, updated valuable medical information, coordination in the treatment of patients, adequate and timely distribution of medicines, collection and effective distribution of valuable data on profiles and patterns of threatening epidemics, contagious diseases and other ailments, among others.

However, there is an ongoing need to support research that demonstrates these benefits within the framework of a cost-benefit analysis in order to justify the often significant up-front costs associated with the implementation of comprehensive, system-wide telemedicine solutions. This, of course, is particularly significant in the context of developing countries with limited financial resources and telecommunications infrastructure. Although these constraints are limiting in many ways, there are significant opportunities to develop innovative approaches to telemedicine that often do not have to contend with legacy systems and bloated bureaucracies in these environments.",
