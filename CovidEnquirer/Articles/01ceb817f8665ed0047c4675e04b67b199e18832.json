Altogether, these data demonstrated that JZ-1 has an 383 anti-HSV-2 effect, which may be related to its induction of autophagic flux. Therefore, Rapa also decreased the release of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6, but treatment with 3-MA 413 dramatically increased the secretion levels of these cytokines (Fig. 6A) . The kinase mTOR is a complex of two mTOR components, mTORC1 and 417 mTORC2, which have different protein components (Bhaskar and Hay, 2007) . 418 mTORC1 is a major negative regulator of autophagy, and the PI3K/Akt pathway is a major upstream major modulator of mTORC1 (Schmelzle and Hall, 2000) . To 420 investigate the mechanism by which JZ-1 induces autophagy, we assessed the changes 421 in the classic PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in the VK2/E6E7 cells. The results from 422 qRT-PCR assays and western blot analyses showed that, compared with that of the 423 control, the expression of PI3K and phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR (p-Akt 424 and p-mTOR) in the HSV-2-infected cells were significantly increased, and these 425 proteins all were decreased significantly in the JZ-1+HSV-2 group (Fig. 5B, Fig. 7C ). showed that, compared with that of the HSV-2 group, the expression levels of PI3K, 433 p-Akt and p-mTOR were significantly reduced in the LY + HSV-2 group, indicating 434 that it indeed inhibited the PI3K/Akt/ mTOR pathway (Fig. 6C, Fig. 7D ). On this 435 basis, we measured the expression levels of LC3B and Atg5 and found that, in the 436 JZ-1 +HSV-2 +LY -treated group, the LC3B and Atg5 mRNA expression levels and 437 the LC3B-II and Atg5 protein expression levels were not different from those in the 438 LY+HSV-2 group (Fig. 6C, Fig. 7D ).

            "text": "88 sexually transmitted diseases in the world and is mainly caused by HSV-2. HSV-2 89 affects approximately 16% of the world's population in the age range of 15-49 years 90 Looker et al., 2008), and it has been shown to increase the risk of human 91 immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sexual acquisition (Freeman et al., 2006). 92 Currently, antiviral drugs are mainly based on three nucleoside analogs: acyclovir, 93 famciclovir and valacyclovir. These drugs significantly inhibit virus replication and 94 improve symptoms in patients, but cannot cure the infection or prevent the spread of 95 HSV-2, and the problem of drug resistance is becoming increasingly pronounced. 96 Patients with impaired immune function may not benefit from the treatment. Besides, 97 the HSV-2 vaccine efficacy trials with individuals with recurrent HSV-2 infection 98 were mostly unsuccessful (Hofstetter et al., 2014). Therefore, the development of new 99 antiviral drugs continues to be explored by scientists and technicians.100 As a cellular defense mechanism, autophagy, a highly conserved catabolic 101 pathway, has received increasing attention in the defense of microbes. Autophagy is a 102 cell homeostasis process that is maintained by fusion of autophagosomes, consisting 103 of intracellular protein aggregates and damaged organelles coated with a double layer 104 of isolated membrane, with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. Autophagy reportedly 105 removes damaged organelles and misfolded proteins, protects cells from nutrient 106 deprivation and microbial infections, and prevents metabolic, heart and 107 neurodegenerative diseases (He et al., 2017). Increasing evidence suggests that host 108 cells attempt to control herpesvirus infection by activating autophagy (Cavignac and itching, and frequent urination to verify and confirm the protective effects of JZ-1 on 152 cervicitis caused by U. urealyticum (Wei et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2007). Our previous 153 research showed that JieZe-2(composed of JZ-1 and the spermicide nonoxynol-9 154 (N-9) can prevent C. albicans and T. vaginalis infection in vivo and in vitro (Chen et 155 al., 2009a; Chen et al., 2009b; Chen et al., 2009c). Taken together, these results 156 suggest that JZ-1 is a valid prescription for damp-heat syndrome, with an action 157 similar to that of Yihuang Tang. Furthermore, some studies have shown that 158 traditional Chinese medicines that can clear heat or remove dampness have an 159 excellent effect on HSV-2 infection (Cheng et al., 2008a; Cheng et al., 2008b; Chin et 160 al., 2010; Sheng, 2010). Therefore, we investigated the effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 161 infection in vitro, and fond it to be a potent anti-HSV-2 herbal medicine. Our previous 162 experiments showed that JZ-1 decoction could protect human vaginal epithelial cells 163 against HSV-2. The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 is superior to that of berberine or 164 penciclovir, and the effect is mainly achieved by augmenting the host cell defenses 165 ability and blocking the adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 (Duan et al., 2019). In a 166 model of HSV-2-infected VK2/E6E7 cells, the expression of the HSV-2 envelope 167 protein gD increased gradually over time, and JZ-1 reduced this gD expression but 168 had no effect on HVEM in the human vaginal epithelial cells infected by HSV-2 (Ai 169 and Chen, 2017; Qiao and Chen, 2016). Moreover, the mechanism involved in the 170 anti-HSV-2 action of JZ-1 may be related to the regulation of the Toll-like receptor 171 signaling pathway and likely is promoted by the secretion of interferon and other 172 downregulating inflammatory factors (Huang and Chen, 2018). However, the related 173 antiviral mechanism of JZ-1 is not fully understood and needs further explanation. 174 Recent studies have shown that HSV-2 blocks autophagic flux but host cells increase 175 autophagy levels to inhibit viral infection in the later stages of the viral replication 176 cycle (Kristen et al., 2015; Petrovski et al., 2014). Therefore, this study explored the 177 underlying mechanisms of JZ-1 in treating HSV-2 infection by inducing autophagy. of 10 traditional Chinese medicines, and the details of the herbal 185 ingredients are shown in",

Changes in LC3B provide a handy marker of autophagy 322 that can be monitored by immunofluorescence and western blotting. In addition, as 323 autophagic flux increases, SQSTM1/p62, another autophagy marker, is recruited to 324 autophagosomes(Klionsky et al., 2016). During the formation of the double-layer 325 autophagy isolation membrane, the ubiquitin-like conjugate ATG12-ATG5 localizes to 326 the autophagosome precursors, and plays an essential role, with LC3, in their 327 development into autophagosomes(Mizushima et al., 2001). Besides, the 328 SQSTM1/p62 protein is the link between LC3 and ubiquitinated substrates, and both 329 LC3 and SQSTM1/p62 serve as indexes of autophagic flux(Bjorkoy et al., 2005). To 330 examine the effects of HSV-2 infection on autophagy, we examined the protein 331 expression levels of LC3B, SQSTM1/p62 and Atg5. The results from the 332 immunofluorescence analysis showed that LC3B was increased in the HSV-2-infected 333 cells(Fig. 2B), a result similar to that from the western blot analysis(Fig. 1A),334    suggesting an accumulation of autophagic elements in the infected cells. Increased335 LC3B-II levels may be the result of autophagy activation or reduced autophagic 336 turnover due to defects in the late stages of autophagic degradation. Was the increased 337 LC3B-II level induced by HSV-2 infection due to the activation of autophagy or 338 reduced autophagy-related protein turnover? Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) was used to 339 determine the cause for the increased level of LC3B-11. Baf A1 is a V-ATPase 340 inhibitor that inhibits autophagosome degradation by blocking the fusion of 341 autophagosomes with lysosomes, and we used it to monitor changes in autophagic 342 flux (Shacka et al., 2006). 343 The immunofluorescence and western blot data showed that the numbers of LC3B 344 puncta and the LC3B-II and SQSTM1/p62 protein expression levels were both 345 decreased in the Baf A1+HSV-2 treated group compared with puncta numbers and 346 expression levels in the Baf A1 group (Fig. 2), suggesting that autophagosome 347 turnover was blocked in the HSV-2-infected cells. Consistently, the protein expression 348 of autophagy-related Atg5 in the HSV-2-infected cells was decreased compared with 349 that in the control group cells. To better study the effect of HSV-2 infection on 350 autophagic flux, the VK2/E6E7 cells were transfected with the mRFP-GFP-LC3B 351 lentivirus, which served as a reporter of autophagic flux (Kimura et al., 2007). Since 352 the GFP signal is pH sensitive, this method can be used to quantify the number of 353 autophagosomes and autolysosomes. The yellow spots represent overlapping red and 354 green spots, indicating autophagosomes that have not fused with lysosomes, while the 355 red spots correspond to autolysosomes (Klionsky et al., 2016). Twenty-four hours 356 after infection, we found a marked increase in the number and proportion of yellow 357 puncta in the cells infected with HSV-2 compared with the number and proportion in 358 the nontreated cells (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results indicate that HSV-5. JZ-1 acts against HSV-2 infection and inhibits HSV-2-induced inflammatory 362 response by inducing autophagic flux 363 The levels of HSV-2 structural viral proteins, such as ICP5 and gD, can be 364 measured as representative of virus replicating events in the cell (Liu et al., 2016; 365 Peretti et al., 2005), and gD, as a major component of the virion envelope, has been 366 previously found to be essential for viral fusion and thus plays a vital role in the 367 cell-to-cell spread of the virus (Spear et al., 2000; Spear and Longnecker, 2003). The 368 results from the western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of ICP5 and 369 gD were increased in the HSV-2-infected cells, indicating enhanced viral replication.370However, the expression levels of ICP5 and gD were significantly reduced in the 371 JZ-1+HSV-2 treated group, suggesting that JZ-1 has an anti-HSV-2 effect(Fig. 4A",

Rapamycin (Rapa) is an 387 inhibitor of mTOR, which can induce an increase in autophagic flux, and388 3-methyladenine(3-MA) is an inhibitor of the class III PtdIns3K, which can block an 389 mRFP-GFP-LC3B lentivirus reporter to determine the number of autophagosomes 391 and autolysosomes. The number of autolysosomes increased after Rapa treatment in 392 the HSV-2 group and in the JZ-1 + HSV-2 group but decreased significantly after 393 3-MA treatment in both groups (Fig. 3B). Consistently, the immunofluorescence and 394 western blotting showed that the numbers of LC3B puncta and the LC3B-II and Atg5 395 protein expression levels were both increased in the Rapa+HSV-2 group but 396 decreased in the 3-MA+HSV-2 group (Fig. 5). The expression levels of virus proteins 397 ICP5 and gD were measured to evaluate the anti-HSV-2 effect, and the results showed 398 that, in Rapa+HSV-2 group, the expression levels of ICP5 and gD were decreased 399 compared with that in the HSV-2 group, while in the 3-MA+HSV-2 group, the levels 400 were further increased compared with that of the HSV-2 group. Moreover, the ICP5 401 and gD protein expression levels of the cells in the JZ-1+3-MA+HSV-2-treated group 402 were higher than those of the cells in the JZ-1+HSV-2 group (Fig. 5A and C), which 403 indicated that the inhibition of autophagy weakens the anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1. Our 404 results indicated that the activation of autophagy protected against HSV-2 infection 405 and that the anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 was mediated by the induction of autophagic 406 flux. 407 Furthermore, HSV-2 infection induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, 408 including IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 and proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, which are 409 important innate immune factors against viral infection (Chew et al., 2009).

            "text": "439 enhanced activity of JZ-1 on the autophagy. Based on the above results, it can be 440 inferred that JZ-1 can induce autophagy in the VK2/E6E7 cells by inhibiting the a linear, double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the subfamily of 445 \u03b1-Herpesviridae. Similar to most viruses, HSV-2 infects host cells following the key 446 steps: virus entry, viral gene expression, viral DNA synthesis, and assembly/egress of 447 progeny virions(Taylor et al., 2002). The virus is taken into the cell by direct fusion 448 with the cell membrane (independent of pH changes) or by endocytosis mediated by 449 specific cell receptors. Both gD and the ICP5 of HSV play essential roles in the two 450 uptake processes described above(Spear et al., 2000). Regardless, the binding of viral 451 glycoproteins to cell attachment sites, usually heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs),452    mediates the entrance of HSV-2(Shukla and Spear, 2001). It has been reported that 453 glycoproteins B and C (gB and gC) of HSV-2 are also necessary for the initiation of454 virus-to-cell attachment. Therefore, the expression levels of the related viral proteins 455 can represent the degree of virus infection and the activity of antiviral drugs. 456 Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular process involving the 457 formation of a bilayer membrane structure called an autophagosome that 458 phagocytoses cytoplasmic macromolecules and damaged organelles and delivers them 459 to the lysosome for degradation and recycling. Autophagy can be divided into three 460 classic types: chaperone-mediated autophagy, microautophagy and macroautophagy, 461 the most extensively studied autophagy (simply referred to as autophagy) (Deretic et 462 al., 2013). As one of the body's immune mechanisms against pathogen infection, 463 autophagy selectively recognizes and removes invading pathogenic microorganisms, 464 such as bacteria and viruses (Sui et al., 2017). Upon induction, phagophores elongate 465 and subsequently enclose a portion of the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of 466 autophagosomes. The outer membrane of the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome 467 (forming the autolysosome), in which the contents of the autophagosome are 468 degraded. In this process, the Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 complex binds to the outer 469 membrane and then dissociates upon completion of the autophagosome. Upon 470 receiving the signal to induce autophagy, Atg7 and Atg3 mediate the conjugation of 471 LC3-I to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3B-II. LC3B-II 472 integrates into both the outer and inner membranes of the autophagosome and 473 facilitates membrane elongation and closure. SQSTM1/p62 is selectively incorporated 474 into autophagosomes through direct binding to LC3; at the end of autophagy, both 475 proteins are effectively degraded. The total cellular expression level of SQSTM1/p62 476 inversely correlates with autophagic activity, while the LC3B-II level positively 477 correlates with autophagic activity (Mizushima et al., 2010). As mentioned in the 478 Introduction, autophagy pathways and autophagy proteins play crucial roles in 479 combating viral infections. Several studies have found that repression of autophagy 480 led to increased viral replication and pathogenesis (Orvedahl et al., 2010), whereas its 481 activation decreased virus infection (Clark et al., 2018). 482 Different from many RNA viruses that induce autophagy and use membrane 483 structures to create scaffolds for virus replication or support the release of viral 484 particles during viral replication, many DNA viruses inhibit autophagy to prevent 485 their own intracellular degradation and phagocytosis or to damage MHC presentation 486 during antigen processing (Paul and Munz, 2016), especially herpesviruses, such as 487 the \u03b1-herpesvirus HSV-1 (Orvedahl et al., 2007), the murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 488 (MHV-68) (E et al., 2009) and the \u03b2-herpesvirus HCMV (Mouna et al., 2016). 489 However, few studies have addressed the changes in autophagy induced by HSV-2. 490 Generally, increased LC3B-II levels with decreased SQSTM1/p62 levels are 491 considered to be the result of increased autophagy. In our study, we found the same 492 results: HSV-2 induces the accumulation of LC3B-II and increases the degradation of 493 SQSTM1/p62. Does this finding indicate that HSV-2 infection induces autophagic 494 flux? Through TEM observation, applying autolysosome inhibitor (Baf A1), and using 495 the lentivirus vector mRFP-GFP-LC3B to track the LC3B marker, we assessed the 496 true influence of HSV-2 on autophagic flux. Compared with that of the group treated 497 with Baf A1 alone, the expression level of LC3B-II, SQSTM1/p62 and Atg5 in the 498 HSV-2 +Baf A1 group was reduced. In lentivirus experiments, the number of unfused 499 autophagosomes was significantly increased in the HSV-2-infected cells. These data 500 indicated that HSV-2 inhibits autophagic flux. As for explanations about LC3B-II 501 being elevated while SQSTM1/p62 is decreased in the HSV-2 infected cells, the 502 increased LC3B-II may be attributed to a partial block of autophagic flux in the 503 HSV-2-infected cells (degradation of LC3B-II is reduced), and SQSTM1/p62, which 504 has been decreased, may be degraded in pathways other than the autophagy pathway 505 (Barth et al., 2010; Moscat and Diaz-Meco, 2009).",

            "text": "As an in-hospital preparation of Tongji Hospital (Approval Number: Z20103135),507    JZ-1 has been widely used for many years. JZ-1 is a prescription based on the 508 modification of Yihuang Tang. In Yihuang Tang, Dioscoreae Rhizoma, Euryales 509 Semen strengthen the spleen and reinforce the stomach, tonify the kidney and inhibit 510 leucorrhoea. Ginkgo Semen convergence and dehumidification, and can also arrest 511 leucorrhoea. Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex clears heat and resolves dampness to treat 512 the syndrome of dampness-heat in the lower jiao, and then, the Plantaginis Semen 513 clearing heat and promoting diuresis. The medicines described above are used 514 together, focusing on invigorating the deficiency, and supplemented by promoted 515 diuresis, they clear heat and eliminate dampness, thereby the deficiency of in the 516 kidney can be recovered, heat cleared and dampness dispelled; then, leucorrhea can 517 be cured. Genital herpes mostly presents with typical symptoms of dampness and heat.518 To strengthen their role in clearing heat and resolving dampness, medicinal 519 ingredients such as Solanum Nigrum, Taraxaci Herba, Herba Patriniae, and Moutan 520 Cortex are added, and those medicinal ingredients that based on tonifying and 521 promoting diuresis are removed. In the JZ-1 prescription, Phellodendri Chinensis 522 Cortex and Ginkgo Semen are used as monarch drugs; the minister drugs include 523 Solanum Nigrum, Taraxaci Herba, and Herba Patriniae; Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma, 524 Dictamni Cortex, and Moutan Cortex are assistant drugs; and Menthae Haplocalycis 525 Herba and Borneolum Syntheticum adjuvant drugs. 526 Many studies have shown that the main components of JZ-1, Phellodendri 527 Chinensis Cortex, Ginkgo Semen, Solanum Nigrum, Taraxaci Herba, Herba Patriniae, 528 Moutan Cortex or their extracts have a protective effect during virus infection. 529 Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex has various pharmacological actions, which have been 530 widely prescribed to remove damp heat, eliminate dampness, counteract toxicity, 531 purge pathogenic fire, relieve consumptive fever, diarrhea and other syndromes(Chen 532 et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex has the 533 immunomodulatory effects of a broad-spectrum antiviral activity by inducing an 534 antiviral state through a type I IFN stimulation mechanism (Kim et al., 2016). Ginkgo 535 Semen, which can converge and eliminate dampness and cure leucorrhoea, is a 536 potential phytomedicine with various pharmacologic effects, including 537 anti-inflammatory effects on inflammatory cells, beneficial effects on neuron 538 degenerative diseases through the prevention of chronic oxidative damage and useful 539 effects for the treatment of diseases related to the production of free radicals 540 (Yoshikawa et al., 1999). In addition, Ginkgo Semen can markedly reduce the 541 infectivity of viruses by preventing their adsorption onto host cells (Haruyama and 542 Nagata, 2013). The functions of Solanum Nigrum are heat-clearing, detoxification 543 and diuresis. Solanum Nigrum plays a role in viral clearance during natural HCV 544 infection, and it might be an alternative treatment for chronic HCV infection (Javed et 545 al., 2011). Taraxaci Herba has the ability to eliminate heat and toxins, as well as to 546 reduce swelling, choleresis, diuresis, and inflammation, and it can inhibit viruses by 547 suppressing viral nucleoprotein synthesis and polymerase activity(He et al., 2011). 548 Herba Patriniae can clear heat and induce detoxification, eliminating phlegm and 549 removing blood stasis, thereby promoting blood circulation. In the model of \u03bb-lysogen, 550 which is used to study the inhibitory effects of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome 551 (SARS) conferred by traditional Chinese medicines, Herba Patriniae effectively 552 quenched the free radicals generated in the process of \u03bb-lysogenic cells by UV 553 radiation, which suggests that Herba Patriniae is a potential Chinese medicine against 554 the SARS virus (Li et al., 2006). The function of Dictamni Cortex is to clear heat and 555 eliminate dampness, induce detoxification, clear hurricane and itching. The function 556 of Smilacis Glabrae Rhizoma is dehumidification and detoxification. Moutan Cortex 557 has the function of clearing heat, cooling blood and removing blood stasis. It is used 558 in TCM as a hepatoprotective and anti-inflammatory herb, which can effectively 559 prevent the entry of HCV and the related Zika flavivirus virus (Behrendt et al., 2017; 560 Poon et al., 2011). Menthae Haplocalycis Herba has the effect of dispelling wind and 561 heat, relieving sore throat, promoting eruption. All these medicines are used together 562 to treat abnormal leukorrhea and erosion of the vulva of genital herpes caused by 563 attack of wind, dampness, heat and toxin, and can achieve good antiviral effects. 564 Our results showed that JZ-1 could significantly reduce the expression of the 565 viral proteins gD and ICP5 in HSV-2-infected VK2/E6E7 cells, suggesting that it also 566 exerts a significant anti-HSV-2 effect. As the main active ingredient in Phellodendri 567 Chinensis Cortex, berberine can induce autophagy by activating the AMPK pathway 568 to inhibit mTOR signaling (Fan et al., 2015). Dandelion root extract has the potential 569 to induce autophagy (Ovadje et al., 2012). It has been shown that paeonol 570 (2'-hydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone), isolated from the Moutan Cortex, can 571 up-regulate autophagy by activating the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway, and the 572 autophagy inhibitor CQ notably attenuates paeonol-induced autophagy (Wu et al., 573 2017). Cao et al. proved that Ginkgo Semen leaf extract can restore autophagy 574 through inhibition of mTOR signaling (Cao et al., 2017). Based on this evidence, we 575 postulate that JZ-1 protects against HSV-2 by inducing autophagy, a supposition 576 confirmed in our later experiments. The TEM images, the mRFP-GFP-LC3B 577 lentivirus reporter observations and results from applying autolysosome inhibitor Baf 578 A1 showed that JZ-1 induces autophagy flux. To confirm whether JZ-1 exerts 579 antiviral effects by regulating autophagy, we treated cells with the autophagy inducer 580 Rapa and inhibitor 3-MA, which are widely used at the early stage of autophagy. 581 3-MA inhibits class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) as well as class III 582 PtdIns3Ks. Class I enzymes generate products such as PtdIns (3,4,5) P3, which inhibit 583 autophagic sequestration, whereas the class III product (PtdIns3P) generally 584 stimulates autophagic sequestration. 3-MA has different temporal patterns of 585 inhibition, causing long-term suppression of the class I PI3Ks but only transient 586 inhibition of the class III form of the enzyme. Therefore, the correct concentration and 587 incubation times are important for interpreting the final results. We conducted many 588 treatment duration and concentration experiments and pretreated the cells with 2.5 589 mM 3-MA for one-half hour finally. 590 One hypothesis has suggested that the antiviral response of autophagy is 591 controlled by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (Shelly et al., 2009), which is known as 592 a key regulator of autophagy. Research has shown that HSV-2 infection results in the 593 activation of PI3K and Akt in the host cells, and BX-795 (a PI3K inhibitor) treatment HSV-2 infection. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy 600 induction by JZ-1 in the HSV-2 infection model, we assessed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR 601 pathway in our study. Our results showed that the autophagy induced by JZ-1 might 602 be mediated upon inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The use of LY, a 603 specific inhibitor of PI3K, to block the JZ-1-induced autophagy confirmed this 604 molecular mechanism. Some limitations of our study are noted. For example, after 605 using LY, the expression of the HSV-2 virus proteins gD and ICP5 could have been 606 further explored to clarify the relationship between the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and 607 the virulence of the infection and the replication rate of HSV-2.608 609",

Moutan Cortex and Menthae Haplocalycis Herba were separately extracted, and the distillate was collected for use. The other herbs were boiled for 3 h, and the herbal 189 mixture filtrate was concentrated to a relative density of 1.08~1.14. The Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex, Moutan Cortex and Menthae Haplocalycis Herba extracts were 191 added to the herbal mixture described above. The final concentration was adjusted to 192 0.5-0.55 g/mL (crude herbs/extract). After cooling for 24 h, borneol (dissolved in 193 anhydrous ethanol) was added, and then the stock solution was filtered through a 194 0.22-micron filter. Nine other drugs in addition to Borneolum Syntheticum were obtained from Hubei Shengdetang Chinese Herbal Pieces Co., Ltd. (Qianjiang, China) and identified by professor Lijun Xu. The following product batches were used: 2018101, and 20181024. Borneolum Syntheticum was obtained from the TCM 199 pharmacy of Tongji Hospital.autophagosomes that has not fused with lysosomes. However, when the autophagosome fuses with the lysosome, the GFP signal is sensitive to the acidic environment in the lysosome and is quenched; therefore, the mRFP punctum that do not emit GFP correspond to an autolysosome.",
