Maintaining the full amino acid sequence of the signal peptide is thought to be important for proper signal processing and protein secretion. We show that at least for one protein, a synthetic human interferon, the presence of a Gateway recombination site within the signal peptide is fully compatible with high levels of protein secretion. The amino termini of the secreted interferon proteins cloned with Gateway and cloned with restriction enzymes and ligase are identical, and the proteins were highly active in biological assays. Compatibility with Gateway cloning simpliWes construction of plasmids directing secretion of recombinant proteins from P. pastoris.",

Because it can attain very high cell densities in chemically deWned medium, and because it naturally secretes few proteins of its own, P. pastoris can be an eYcient producer of secreted proteins. Secretion of the protein of interest is often directed by fusing the gene to be expressed to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating factor (AMF) signal sequence [3] . The AMF signal sequence comprises the amino terminal 89 amino acids of the AMF protein. During secretion of the AMF from S. cerevisiae the signal peptide is removed by two processing enzymes. The enzyme Kex2 cleaves after a speciWc lysinearginine, then Ste13 clips oV the dipeptides EA and EA to yield the mature AMF [4] (Fig. 1 ). Homologous enzymes operate in P. pastoris. It is preferable to keep the amino acid sequence of the signal peptide unchanged if possible while fusing it to a gene to be expressed. The standard way to do this is to remove part of the cloning vector from the XhoI site 6 amino acids upstream of the processing sites to a point downstream, then to construct the XhoI fragment containing the gene of interest with a 5\u0408",

Since both expression vectors had lost 23 bases of the mating factor signal peptide coding sequence as a result of the XhoI digestion, the Hy3 gene was PCR ampliWed with primers that added those 23 bases to the 5\u0408 end of the Hy3 coding sequence. For REaL cloning the PCR primers contained XhoI (5\u0408) and Shaded codons in B derive from the attB1 site, and represent amino acids that are added to the signal peptide by conversion of the secretion vector to the Gateway system.

The upper and lower bands of the Gateway and REaL Hy3 proteins (Fig. 5) had the same sequences, NH2-EAEACDL,, showing that while the Pichia homolog of Kex2 had cleaved at the expected site (Fig. 4) , the Ste13 homolog did not. IneYcient Ste13 processing of the AMF signal peptide in Pichia is common (for example, see [5, 6] ). Migration of IFNs as doublets on SDS-PAGE is presumably due to disulWde bond formation, since extensive heating with reducing agent considerably diminished the doublets (our unpublished observations).",

Comparison to the 2c standard on both the SDS-PAGE gel and the antibody dot blot suggested concentrations of secreted Hy3 protein of 100-150 mg per liter. Since neither of these expression strains was selected for multiple copies of the expressed gene, we assume that each contains one copy per P. pastoris genome, the most common number.
