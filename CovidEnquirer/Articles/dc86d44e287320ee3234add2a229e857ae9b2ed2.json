            "text": "Brefeldin A (BFA), a unique fungal metabolite of a 13-membered lactone ring, exhibits various biological actions, including antitumor, antifungal and antiviral activities. In the present study, mouse LB cells were treated with various concentrations of interferon (IFN) and/or BFA overnight and infected with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) after removal of IFN and BFA. Doses of BFA which neither inhibit the metabolism of the cell nor the infectivity of EMCV, decreased the IFN-induced antiviral activity against EMCV as demonstrated by virus titer from supernatants. Since 2-5A synthetase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) have been suggested to be involved in the antiviral action of IFN against EMCV, their activities were investigated in LB cells after BFA treatment. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed a decrease (2-3-fold) in the mRNA of 2'-5' oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase after BFA treatment. BFA also inhibited the activity of 2-5A synthetase, 2-5A dependent RNase i and phosphorylation of PKR in cellular extracts, indicating that BFA may be exerting its inhibitory effect both at theltranscriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This study reports a new biological action of BFA, demonstrating that BFA antagonized the antiviral action of IFN by inhibiting IFN-induced enzymatic pathways. These studies also suggest that both 2-5A and PKR are important in the antiviral activity of IFN against EMCV.",

The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by addition of 2 x SDS-gel sample buffer, and heated at 90\u00b0C for 5 min. Phosphoproteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography.",

BFA did not have any effect on the infectious cycle of adenovirus because adenovirus did not involve the glycoprotein secretion for its infectivity (Maynell et al., 1992) . BFA inhibits the replication of poliovirus, a non-enveloped virus, possibly by preventing the formation of vesicles which are required for RNA replication. In the present study, BFA did not inhibit the EMCV, a non-enveloped virus which is similar to poliovirus. While studying the effect of BFA on poliovirus replication, BFA was present in the medium during the period of replication of virus, however, in the present study, 20-fold lower concentration of BFA was used and removed before EMCV adsorption and replication. The discrepancy in the inhibition of poliovirus and EMCV by BFA may be due to the BFA dosage and the incubation of the drug during the virus replication cycle.",

During EMCV infection, enhanced phosphorylation of PKR has been reported, probably due to its binding to replication complexes of EMCV (Aujean et al., 1979; Levintow, 1974) . Data reported in this paper show a significant increase in the level of phosphorylated PKR in IFN-treated uninfected or EMCV-infected LB cells. BFA treatment along with IFN inhibited either the phosphorylation or expression of PKR in IFN-treated cells, whether EMCV-infected or uninfected, thereby suggesting an overall decrease in the phosphorylation of elF27.

In the presence of dsRNA, 2-5A synthetase polymerizes ATP into 2-5A. 2-5A activates endonuclease which then degrades mRNA , and as a result viral protein synthesis is inhibited. In the present study, Northern and in situ hybridization analysis show that the 2-5A synthetase gene was highly expressed in IFNtreated cells but was significantly decreased in these cells by BFA. Since 2-5A synthetase is an index of 2-5A, it would appear that there was a concomitant reduction in the level of 2-5A, leading to inhibition in the activation of 2-5A dependent RNase. The level of 2-5A dependent RNase was reduced in IFN plus BFA-treated cells, whether infected or uninfected, as compared to infected or uninfected cells treated with IFN alone. The loss of 2-5A dependent nuclease activity has been monitored both by loss of the 2-5Abinding protein (presumptive nuclease) and directly by loss of activatable nuclease Cayley et al., 1982) . Mixing experiments failed to demonstrate the presence of any soluble inhibitor of the nuclease and 2-5A which could compete for the binding with nuclease in the inhibited extracts. Therefore, the decrease in the 2-5A dependent RNase may be attributed to the loss of the nuclease or its inactivation by and BFA (0.2/zg/ml) for overnight. Using first set, RNA was prepared, blotted and hybridized with 2-5A synthetase probe. The autoradiogram was scanned and the inhibition in the transcripts was obtained. Cellular lysate was obtained from the second set and the activity of the enzyme was obtained using radiobinding assay at each dose of IFN in the presence of BFA. The data was plotted to find whether the inhibition of the enzyme by BFA is at transcriptional or post-transcriptional level.",
