However, newly emerging infectious diseases (EID) and more well-established tropical disease pathogens present complex challenges to vaccine developers; in particular, neglected tropical diseases, which are most prevalent among the world's poorest, include many pathogens with large sizes, multistage life cycles and a variety of nonhuman vectors. EID such as MERS-CoV and H7N9 are highly pathogenic for humans. For many of these pathogens, while their genomes are available, immune correlates of protection are currently unknown. These complexities make developing vaccines for EID and neglected tropical diseases all the more difficult. In this review, we describe the implementation of an immunoinformatics-driven approach to systematically search for key determinants of immunity in newly available genome sequence data and design vaccines. This approach holds promise for the development of 21st century vaccines, improving human health everywhere.",

Old world pathogens such as Dengue and Chikungunya virus, previously restricted to the Middle East, Africa and Asia have now appeared in the Americas [1] . Newer pathogens such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), an entirely new coronavirus affecting humans, have been spreading beyond the region of the world from which they derive their names [2] . Meanwhile, human populations in developing areas of the world continue to be threatened by neglected tropical diseases (NTD). More than two billion people -nearly 30% of the world's population -suffer from one or more NTD [3] , which include leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, among others (TABLE 1 ). In addition to climate change and airline travel, economic conditions leading to transmigration contribute to the spread of NTD. Recent examples include the reemergence of Leishmania in Spain [4] and Chagas disease in Texas [5] .",

In contrast, vaccines for important emerging infectious diseases (EID, TABLE 2) are being developed, to a certain extent, by large biotechnology companies, particularly when these companies receive guaranteed purchase agreements or other incentives to accelerate vaccine development. Examples include the development of a vaccine for H7N9 (an emerging avian influenza) by Novartis and Novavax in 2013 [6, 7] and work toward the development of a new MERS-CoV vaccine in 2014 [8] . However, the standard approach to develop new vaccines for emerging (and reemerging) infectious disease threats, which is to implement previously existing vaccine design methodologies such as cloning and expressing the dominant surface antigen [9] , frequently results in the development of vaccines that are only effective when given with strong adjuvants [10] . This approach is particularly unlikely to work for pathogens that have complex lifecycles (such as parasites) or are highly mutable (such as RNA viruses). This article will discuss new, computational approaches that may accelerate and improve the design of vaccines for NTD and EID.",

Although vaccines are in development for several NTD pathogens [11] , lack of financial incentive to invest in research and development programs for diseases concentrated in lowincome countries has mired the progress of vaccine efforts among large pharmaceutical companies [3] . Preventative chemotherapy mass drug administration (MDA) programs employing donated or extremely low-cost generic drugs are currently in progress to control lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, leprosy, trachoma and helminthiases in many areas of the world [12] . A complication inherent in this strategy is that because the regions affected by different NTD overlap, coinfections can be difficult to manage with antiparasitic agents [13] . The success of these long-term efforts and off-target effects of mass-eradication campaigns at the individual and population levels remain to be determined [14] . As has been observed for polio, geopolitical upheaval may hamper global efforts to eradicate NTD. Thus, effective NTD vaccines are still needed [15] . New cost-effective design methodologies can help to bridge the gap between the great need for these vaccines and return on investment for pharmaceutical companies. Fortunately, genomes for many newly emerging pathogens and neglected tropical disease-associated pathogens are becoming available due to research efforts worldwide [16] . The availability of these genomes now makes it possible to apply computational vaccinology tools to these diseases of global health importance.",

Innate immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer cells are responsible for the first line of defense, while adaptive immunity provides a more targeted response to pathogens that establishes immune memory for more rapid responses upon repeated exposures. B cells produce antibodies which are capable of recognizing and neutralizing pathogenic antigens. T cells support antibody production, activation and memory development, and are capable of lysing infected cells. The potent response from T and B cells, however, comes at a cost. Whereas innate immune cells can respond within 24-72 h, the primary adaptive response normally takes 7-14 days to mature. Secondary adaptive responses driven by immune memory are much faster and much stronger. This is the principle behind vaccination: pre-exposure to pathogen-derived antigens can induce pathogen-specific immune memory. The discovery of critical antigens that drive protective memory is facilitated by new computational tools.",

Since T cells play a critical role in adaptive immunity and the development of immune memory required for an efficacious vaccine, computational tools have been used to search for small linear peptides (T-cell epitopes) derived from protein antigens that drive class I and class II T-cell responses. These peptides are displayed on the surface of APC by multiple alleles of the MHC. As human beings express multiple alleles of class I and class II MHC molecules, called human leukocyte antigens (HLA), computational vaccinologists now search for T-cell epitopes that can bind to the most common HLA alleles in the human population, reasoning that broad HLA coverage will contribute to the development of effective genome-derived vaccines. Computational tools can also be used to select epitoperich surface proteins that are better immunogens to drive B-cell response. Fortunately, while B cells and antibodies generally recognize surface proteins, T cells recognize epitopes derived from a broader range of proteins, giving the computational vaccinologist many possible sources (internal and external proteins as well as secreted proteins) for the selection of T-cell epitopes for vaccines.",

This response may include T cell help for induction of higher antibody titers, T-cell-mediated lysis of infected cells and the expression of cytokines to coordinate other cell-mediated immune processes such as activation of APC. Breadth of T-cell response (responding to many different epitopes) appears to be correlated with protection from severe disease for many pathogens that affect humans. More specifically, for HIV, HBV, HCV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and malaria, protection from disease has been correlated with broad T-cell epitope response to both 'immunodominant' and subdominant T-cell epitopes [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . These discoveries have contributed to the concept that vaccines can be made directly from genomes by selecting sets of epitopes that will stimulate immune responses and protect against diseases.",

Proof of principle exists for a number of disease models: cellular immunity elicited by epitope immunization provided complete protection against respiratory syncytial virus challenge, partial protection of BALB/c mice against sporozoite challenge, elimination of malaria-infected hepatocytes in vitro, partial protection of BALB/c and CBA against encephalitis following intracerebral challenge with a lethal dose of measles virus, complete protection from intraperitoneal HSV challenge, protection against infection with malaria or influenza A virus and full protection of sheep against bovine leukemia virus (these examples are reviewed in [23] ). We have demonstrated complete protection against lethal vaccinia challenge [24] and successful clearance of a chronic bacterial infection (Helicobacter pylori) following T-cell epitope-driven vaccination [25] . In earlier studies, we achieved partial protection against an aerosolized bacterial pathogen (Tularemia [26]) using a vaccine that contained only 14 epitopes. While mice are not humans, growing evidence that T-cell epitope-driven vaccines can be effective in humans has led to the establishment of a number of biotech startups and venture-backed companies focused entirely on T-cell epitopebased vaccines.",

Others may be proteins that serve as 'housekeeping' genes that are also well conserved in harmless commensal organisms. On the other hand, proteins that are highly conserved across variant strains, that are pathogen-specific and those that are upregulated during interactions with the host, particularly those that are secreted by a pathogen (presumably in an attempt to alter the host environment), are excellent targets for vaccine development.",

The Expert Protein Analysis System (ExPASy) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics offers a wide variety of proteomics tools that can be used for this purpose, including tools related to protein identification and characterization. Our groups have adapted an approach first described by Gennaro et al. for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) [49] , employing a series of ExPASy tools (SignalP, TMPred and Prosite Scan [50] ) to triage pathogen genomes, reducing the number of potential targets from thousands of proteins to several dozen candidate antigens. In our first test of this approach, we found that a subset of epitopes derived from the Mtb genome elicited IFN-g response from Mtb-exposed human samples, and prototype epitope-based TB vaccines were shown to be robustly immunogenic in murine studies [51] . reflect more epitope content than expected, while negative scores reflect less epitope content than expected [52] . Large numbers of protein sequences derived directly from the genome of selected pathogens can be ordered by potential class I (CTL), class II (T helper) or both class I and class II epitope content and placed on an immunogenicity scale (FIGURE 1). This tool allows researchers to quickly rank a given set of proteins both in relative (i.e., relative to each other) and absolute (i.e., relative to a panel of known immunogens and nonimmunogenic proteins) terms [53] . In our experience, epitope-rich proteins are good vaccine targets and elicit strong antibody responses -thus, as previously stated, T-cell epitope content is a useful proxy for overall immunogenic potential.",

For example, in FIGURE 1, we show two candidate antigens derived from B. malayi, a causative agent of lymphatic filariasis, whose life cycle is divided into multiple larval stages including a microfilarial stage [54] . In this case, TPX-2, a protein that has been identified as a potential vaccine target [55] , is shown to contain minimal T-cell epitope content, with an immunogenicity score of -27.61, and thus it may be less successful as a vaccine candidate. In contrast, Juv-p120, a B. malayi ortholog of a Litomosoides sigmodontis antigen implicated in conferring protection against microfilarial infection [56] carries substantially more T-cell epitope content, scoring +94.14 on the immunogenicity scale, in the same range as other well-known immunogens. Furthermore, as is illustrated here in the case of B. malayi, we frequently find evidence that pathogens appear to reduce T-cell epitope content in key proteins to avoid human immune responses. Epitope deletion is an established means of immune evasion in HIV and HCV [57, 58] ; thus, the mechanism may also be relevant in the context of infections that are associated with chronic infection caused by filaria, leishmania and other chronic NTD, particularly in stages associated with chronic parasitism and parasite persistence in the face of immune pressure. We will discuss additional means of immune evasion that can be uncovered by computational tools below.",

Because TCRs are produced in a myriad of possible conformations (much like antibodies, to which they are related), MHC binding is the dominant event in immune recognition. In other words, most MHC ligands are also T-cell epitopes, and T-cell epitopes are by definition, MHC ligands. The MHC-peptide interaction is well characterized [59, 60] .

To capture this concept, the EpiMatrix immunogenicity scale presents proteins by the EpiMatrix protein score, and compares them to other known immunogens. The EpiMatrix protein score is the difference between the number of predicted T-cell epitopes expected in a protein of a given size and the number of putative epitopes predicted by the EpiMatrix. The EpiMatrix protein scores are 'normalized' and can be plotted on a standardized scale. 'Average' proteins score near zero. Protein scores above zero indicate the presence of excess MHC ligands and denote a higher potential for immunogenicity, while scores below zero indicate the presence of fewer potential MHC ligands than expected and a lower potential for immunogenicity. The EpiMatrix protein score is correlated with observed immunogenicity in vitro and in vivo. As shown here, proteins scoring above +20, such as Brugia malayi antigen Juv-p120, are considered to have a significant immunogenic potential.

The EpiMatrix algorithm compares the amino acid sequence of each given 9-mer peptide to the coefficients contained in stored probability matrices and produces a raw score. In order to compare potential epitopes across multiple HLA alleles, EpiMatrix raw scores are converted to a normalized 'Z' scale. Peptides scoring above 1.64 on the EpiMatrix 'Z' scale (typically the top 5% of any given sample) are likely to be MHC ligands [63] .

Our group has been investigating epitope crossconservation with the human genome and its association with diminished or regulatory immune responses. Using a recently developed tool called JanusMatrix we first determined that published effector T-cell epitopes can be distinguished from reported regulatory T-cell epitopes on the basis of TCR-specific cross-reactive potential with the human genome and human microbiome [67] . JanusMatrix differs from whole-sequence alignment tools such as BLAST [68] in its basis upon T-cell receptor homology. Pathogenic peptides whose TCR-facing residues are identical to the epitopes contained in multiple self may be recognized by T cells specific to those human proteins. Of course, even though the MHC-facing residues may differ, these peptides must still have the capacity to bind to the same MHC as the pathogen sequence, provided that binding is preserved. Taking this into account, JanusMatrix compares the TCR-facing contour of pathogen ligands to other genomes of interest, identifying matches therein that are predicted to bind the same MHC. TCR-homologous epitopes shared between pathogens and humans, or pathogens and other microbes, can be uncovered with remarkable speed using the JanusMatrix tool.",

It has been shown that putative epitopes for HLA class II are not often distributed evenly across protein sequences, but instead tend to cluster in specific regions, where it is not uncommon to observe several reactive 9-mer frames in close proximity [76] . These 'clusters' of unusually high predicted epitope density can be identified in silico using the ClustiMer algorithm. In general, T-cell epitope clusters identified by the ClustiMer algorithm tend to be promiscuous MHC binders and are frequently T-cell epitopes [52] . Due to overlapping peptide-binding preferences among HLA-DR alleles, it is also possible to identify single 9-mers capable of binding four or more HLA alleles [76] . These sequences have been dubbed 'EpiBars' due to their horizontal, band-like signature in readout from EpiMatrix (FIGURE 3) . T-cell epitope clusters can be very powerful, and EpiBars may be a characteristic feature of highly immunogenic, promiscuous class II epitopes. These compact, highly reactive peptides are relatively easy to deliver and show great promise as vaccine components when cross-reactivity with the human genome is limited (see above). We have used these clusters extensively in our own work [24, 43, 51] .",

The problem of pathogen variability significantly complicates the selection of epitopes for vaccine design. To address this problem, EpiVax has developed EpiAssembler [80] to identify sets of overlapping, conserved and immunogenic epitopes and to assemble them into extended immunogenic consensus sequences (ICS, FIGURE 5 ). The theory behind developing ICS is that processing and presentation of these sequences would allow for presentation of the highly conserved class II-restricted epitopes contained in the ICS in the context of more than one MHC. The resulting peptide is not a 'pseudo-sequence' as such, since each constituent epitope occurs in its corresponding position in the native protein; adjacent epitopes may be similarly conserved but not in the same variant of the pathogen. The ICS approach has been useful for identifying highly immunogenic epitopes for HIV vaccine design [38] . Using HIV as an example, while the full composite ICS peptides happen to be exactly conserved in a few individual strains of HIV, each peptide represents a significant percentage of circulating strains because every constituent overlapping epitope is conserved in a large number (range 893-2254) of individual HIV-1 strains [38] .",

An ideal vaccine might include whole proteins in addition to some epitopes; some or all of these antigens could be optimized using the ICS approach.

Putative epitopes derived from known antigens or from proteins overexpressed during early stages of infection or proteins known to be exposed to immune surveillance as reported in the literature may be prioritized. Furthermore, putative epitopes with the in silico profile of potential regulatory T-cell epitopes (based on JanusMatrix analysis) are removed from further consideration. Figure 3 . Example of an EpiBar: EpiMatrix analysis of candidate lymphatic filariasis epitope. In addition to providing an overall immunogenicity score, EpiMatrix can be used to analyze epitopes at the local level. A Brugia malayi Juv-p120 peptide is shown above, parsed into 9-mer frames and analyzed for predicted immunogenicity. EpiMatrix assessments above 1.64 constitute the top 5% of predicted HLA binders and are shaded medium blue, while scores above 2.32 fall in the top 1% and are shaded dark blue. This Juv-p120 peptide registers significant scores for all eight alleles in EpiMatrix in a single 9-mer frame, and based on the EpiMatrix method, has a cluster score of 16.81 (reflecting the number of predicted binders per amino acid length). Cluster scores higher than 10 are considered to be significant based on retrospective and prospective studies carried out by the EpiVax group. The band-like pattern illustrated in frame 35 is called an EpiBar and is characteristic of promiscuous epitopes. Algorithms can also be helpful to interpret vaccine component responses in preclinical and clinical studies. In studies of immune response to therapeutic proteins and vaccines, the authors have observed that subject-to-subject variation in T-cell response closely relates to subject HLA type and the number of motifs or peptides that match the subject's HLA haplotype. To describe this relationship, EpiVax researchers have developed a metric that may be useful in clinical assessment of immune response to vaccines, called the 'individualized T-cell epitope measure' or iTEM. For a given T-cell epitope, an individual's iTEM score can be calculated by weighting and summing the epitope's EpiMatrix Z-scores for each HLA allele in a given subject's haplotype. This calculated score allows for individualized immunogenic potential to be predicted based on the number of putative epitopes contained in a protein and a given individual's HLA haplotype. Using this score, it is possible to analyze the contribution of haplotype to the corresponding T-cell response. In prospective and retrospective evaluations, significant correlations were found between the IFN-g response to a given antigen and the iTEM scores for individual subjects [42] . In addition, correlations between the iTEM score and patient HLA have been observed for antibody titers [40, 81, 82] , reflecting the importance of HLA-restricted T-cell responses to the genesis of a robust antidrug antibody response.",

Peptide sequences contained in the junctional regions between the target epitopes are evaluated for potential immunogenicity. The highest scoring junction is identified and the algorithm optimizes the order of epitopes by evaluating potential alternative sequences. The process is repeated until no additional reductions in junctional immunogenicity can be achieved or until all junctional immunogenic potential has been eliminated. When the potential for junctional immunogenicity cannot be sufficiently reduced, a cleavage promoting spacer sequence, typically 'AAY' for class I restricted constructs [86] or a binding inhibiting 'breaker' sequence such as 'GPGPG' for class II restricted constructs [87] is placed between the two offending epitopes.

Compared to conventional strategies, this approach has the potential to create more effective and safer next-generation vaccines, as carefully selected epitopes focus immune responses on the minimal, essential pathogen-specific antigenic elements; epitopes directed against conserved 'self' (host) antigens are eliminated. This approach is also well suited for highly variable pathogens, as selection of epitopes that are conserved across multiple strains or subtypes enables the development of a broadly applicable, multipathogen vaccine. The genome-derived vaccine strategy has been applied by our team to a wide range of pathogens, including F. tularensis, variola, HIV, Mtb, H. pylori and influenza. These studies demonstrate that immunoinformatic-predicted epitopes are immunoreactive in vaccinees and survivors of infection, and stimulate de novo, protective immune responses in vivo in HLA transgenic mice (e.g., [24] [25] [26] 51] ). Epitope-driven vaccines offer distinct advantages over traditional subunit vaccines. Multiple epitopes derived from several antigens can be packaged together. Thus, a broad-based immune response directed against several different antigenic proteins can be elicited without manufacturing and administering the entire protein, much of which will be immunologically irrelevant. This may reduce formulation challenges, cost and safety risk. The use of epitopes also mitigates safety concerns arising from the use of intact recombinant proteins that may have undesired biological activity.",

A major caveat concerning the use of the iVAX toolkit is that none of the vaccines designed using these tools have advanced to the clinic. Given the cycle of vaccine development, this is not surprising (it may take up to 20 years to develop a vaccine with full industry support).

ICS: Immunogenic consensus sequences. A similar approach was used during the emergence of SARS and completely failed to protect against rapidly evolving SARS viruses in animal challenge models [9, 90] . Application of advanced immunoinformatics tools to NTD vaccines has also lagged for a number of reasons. NTD researchers do not use the tools because they lack access to and familiarity with them, and there are no widely publicized examples focusing on diseases that impact the developing world. A series of technical challenges for NTD vaccines have been described recently, including antigen discovery, process development, preclinical development, clinical trials in resource-poor settings and the immune response to NTD infection, including what is commonly referred to as the IgE trap, through which certain individuals, perhaps especially those in endemic regions, may have elevated preexisting IgE antibodies for potential NTD vaccine antigens, leading to increased risk with vaccination [91] . Computational vaccinology cannot currently address all of these challenges; however, the approach described here offers a unique opportunity to address certain hurdles early in the developmental process. Early in the pipeline, antigen discovery using T-cell epitope prediction and ranking, along with candidate epitope triage using cluster analysis and crossreactivity prediction provide valuable leads. Selected peptide candidates can be screened ex vivo in order to verify the phenotype of the immune response prior to inclusion in a final vaccine product.",

A pertinent example for NTD and EID applies to vector-based targets. Vaccine components based upon the salivary proteins of arthropod vectors are already under investigation [92] . However, vector salivary antigens also have known immunomodulatory properties allowing for extended host tolerance [93, 94] .

Vaccine efficacy may also improve, as the selection of targets can be refined by comparing the antigen to other genome sequences, such as the human genome and the human microbiome. The in silico-based approach to vaccine design may also alleviate many of the funding-associated challenges common to traditional vaccine design, by reducing the number of assays that need to be performed to select vaccine targets. Reduced cost should allow for the reallocation of critical funding to the testing of in silico-predicted targets and constructs. And finally, improved safety, by eliminating human genome cross-conserved epitopes, may reduce unwanted adverse effects.
