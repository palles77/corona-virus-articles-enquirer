The present study evaluated parameters of importance for spray drying of siRNA-loaded poly(D,Llactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) into nanocomposite microparticles intended for inhalation. The spray drying process was optimised using a statistical design of experiment and by evaluating powder characteristics upon systematic variation of the formulation parameters. Concentration, carbohydrate excipient (trehalose, lactose and mannitol) and the ratio of NP to excipient were varied to monitor the effects on moisture content, particle morphology, particle size and powder yield. The identified optimum conditions were applied for spray drying of siRNA-loaded nanocomposite microparticles, resulting in a product with a low water content (0.78% w/w) and an aerodynamic particle diameter considered suitable for inhalation. The use of mannitol in the formulation allowed a significantly lower moisture content than trehalose and lactose. The inclusion of 50% (w/w) or higher amounts of NPs resulted in a marked change in the surface morphology of the spray-dried particles. Importantly, the integrity and biological activity of the siRNA were preserved during the spray drying process. In conclusion, the present results show that spray drying is a suitable technique for producing nanocomposite microparticles comprising siRNA-containing PLGA NPs for potential use in inhalation therapy.",

            "text": "The concept of RNA interference (RNAi), mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), provides an opportunity for a whole new class of drugs directed towards disease-associated genes. However, before RNAi can be used to its full potential for treatment of a variety of diseases, challenges regarding the delivery of siRNA need to be overcome [1] . A promising approach to overcoming delivery challenges related to stability and cellular targeting of siRNA is local delivery of siRNA directly onto the diseased tissue using a delivery system capable of protecting the siRNA from degradation [1, 2] . Poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) have been proposed for delivering macromolecules, such as siRNA, to the cytosol of cells in vitro [3, 4] . The NPs have been shown to be taken up by endocytosis and can escape the endosomes to a certain degree before degradation [4] and subsequently release the drug, although the mechanism of endosomal escape is unclear at present. Once present in the cytosol, the PLGA is suggested to be degraded slowly, sustaining the release of encapsulated siRNA, a property which might be very useful for therapeutic purposes [3] .",

            "text": "In this perspective, the airways are interesting sites for local delivery of siRNA. The lungs are exposed to a variety of pollutants on a daily basis and are therefore also susceptible to a wide range of diseases. Examples of airway-located diseases, which would be treatable with siRNA, are cancer and infections like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza [2, 5] . Diseases may affect different parts of the airways, which branch out approximately 17 times before ending up in the alveoli [6] . However, many infections are localized in the lower airways [7, 8] , so efficient delivery systems must be developed to treat airway diseases. Even though the total alveoli surface area of 100-150 m 2 in adults provides a large surface for drug deposition [9] , the branching, mucociliary clearance and breathing are mechanisms that prevent particles from entering the lower airways. To overcome these barriers and achieve particle deposition in the lower airways, the size distribution and aerodynamic behaviour of the particles intended for inhalation are of great importance. The aerodynamic diameter can be used to predict the behaviour of a given particle in an airstream and thereby predict the site of impact with airway epithelium. Larger particles with an aerodynamic diameter above 5 \u00b5m will most likely impact with the tissue of the mouth, throat or upper lung mucosa and be eliminated from there, whereas particles smaller than 1 \u00b5m will often suffer from being exhaled and thus not be deposited in the alveoli. When formulating drugs for pulmonary delivery, another issue to be considered is the clearance mechanism for particles deposited in the deeper areas of the lungs. The clearance in the deeper areas of the lungs is mostly provided by pulmonary macrophages, which are mobile phagocytic cells monitoring the inner surface of the alveoli by ingesting and degrading pathogens and particles. Even though microsized particles will be processed by the pulmonary macrophages, NPs with a diameter smaller than approximately 260 nm might escape macrophage clearance [10, 11] .",

The methodology of spray drying enables formation of particles of a size suitable for inhalation comprising both NPs and an excipient [12] [13] [14] . Furthermore, nanocomposite microparticles composed of PLGA NPs and sugars, such as trehalose and lactose, have been shown to decompose in the lung lining fluid, releasing the NPs from the formulation [12] [13] [14] . The spray drying process is widely applied for production of inhalable particles, and allows for a large degree of variation of the final product. Spray drying has previously been used for a number of applications, including the preparation of dry powder protein particles intended for inhalation [15, 16] , as well as dry powder containing cationic PLGA nanoparticles, the latter to prevent aggregation and loss of transfection potential when subsequently complexed to pDNA [17] .",

Several parameters in the drying process itself, as well as the composition of the feed formulation, greatly influence the characteristics of the dry end product [18, 19] . Carbohydrate excipients function as bulking agents that enable production of stable particles of a size suitable for inhalation and allow a rapid release of the NPs in the lung lining fluid upon inhalation. Also, the excipients are added to the formulation to provide some degree of protection of the NPs and the encapsulated drug (in this case siRNA) during the process of spray drying, in particular against shear forces and increased temperatures. Excipients like mannitol, trehalose and lactose are commonly used in spray drying with satisfying end products [13, 20] . These carbohydrates are dissolvable in water [21] and possess good safety profiles and are thus good choices for the production of the nanocomposite microparticles, which should decompose quickly in the lung lining fluid.",

The instrument employed a time of flight principle, measuring the velocity of the individual particles where the aerodynamic diameter was defined as the diameter of a spherical particle with the same velocity and behaviour as the analyzed particle. The resulting particle size distribution accounted for the density, was number based and was afterwards converted to a mass based particle size distribution by the software provided with the instrument. A few mg of spray dried powder was placed on the turntable inside the Small-Scale Powder Disperser and introduced into the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer by a Venturi aspirator. The flow rate and the rotation rate of the Small-Scale Powder Disperser were controlled to yield a particle concentration in the range of 0.3-3.0 mg/m 3 and analysis was carried out continuously for 20 s. It was assumed that the shear forces present in the Small-Scale Powder Disperser were sufficient to deagglomerate the spray dried particles, which might not be the case for pharmaceutical devices used for inhalation therapy. For powders dispersed with metered dose inhalers the aerodynamic particle size obtained with the Aerodynamic Particle Sizer Spectrometer 3321 correlated well with the aerodynamic particle size obtained with cascade impactors [24, 25] . The formulation in the present study was spray dried and the dry powder was assumed to be chemically homogeneous making the chemical analysis of the cascade impactors less important.

Factors showing a significant effect on the aerodynamic diameter of the nanocomposite microparticles were ratio (P = 0.0023) and concentration (P = 0.0005) of the sample. High ratios provided particles of slightly smaller MMAD, whereas high concentrations resulted in higher MMAD. The dry powder yield was significantly affected by the ratio of NPs to excipient (P = 0.0063), as increasing the ratio lead to a lower yield. Also, the yield was dependent on the concentration of total dry substance in the feed formulation (P = 0.0016), since a higher yield was obtained at increased concentrations. However, the effect of concentration on the yield could also be due to a reduced loss in the collection process, since larger amounts were used with increasing concentrations.

The nanocomposite microparticles were all shown to be of acceptable quality, proving that the chosen fixed parameters were suitable. However, nanocomposite microparticles containing mannitol showed a significantly lower water content than the other formulations. The low water content in the powder is highly desirable, since it will decrease interparticulate cohesion and thereby increase the respirability of the powder [15, 27] . A high water content might also have a negative effect on the stability of the product [15] . For these reasons, mannitol was chosen for all succeeding studies. The ratio of NPs to excipient was also shown to have an effect on the water content; increasing the ratio provided a lower moisture content. However, this effect was minor compared to the effect of using mannitol and was thus not taken into consideration.

The concentration of total dry substance in the feed formulation had a positive effect on the particle size, as the particle size increased with a higher concentration. This effect has previously been described in literature [16, [28] [29] [30] and is thought to be caused by a larger amount of dry substance in each droplet after atomisation in the spray dryer. The ratio had a small negative effect on the particle size, as the particle size decreased when the amount of NPs in the feed formulation was increased. This could be correlated to the observation of corrugated particles appearing when higher amounts of NPs were used. The corrugated surface morphology changes the aerodynamic properties of the particles and thus also the MMAD. The ratio and concentration in the feed formulation were also shown to have an effect on the yield of dry powder. Increased concentrations resulted in a higher yield, whereas a high ratio reduced the yield. An increase in yield at higher concentrations has previously been reported [16, 19] and corresponds well with the results. Since the cyclone used for product recovery relies on centrifugal forces for collection of the final product, larger particles will have a higher recovery rate. As it has already been shown that increased concentrations lead to larger MMAD, the observation that increasing concentrations increase the yield corresponds well with this. The finding that increasing the ratio provides lower yields also corresponds with this, since the increased ratio has been shown to decrease the MMAD. Besides providing the optimal formulation, the experimental setup for determination of the optimal factors proved that the fixed spray drying parameters were suitable for the formulation of nanocomposite microparticles with a size range applicable for inhalation, since almost all samples were of the appropriate size and with moderate water content. Thus, based on the results of the statistical evaluation a high concentration and a low ratio combined with mannitol as excipient were chosen for further studies.",

This effect is not seen from the values measured in this study. Particles containing mannitol in this study have very low water content, and this may be the reason for the different results, since the particle aggregation will be significantly reduced. The analysis method in this study differs from the method used for measuring the respirable fraction in the study by Bosquillon et al. [20] , where the methods of tap density and electrical zone sensing on spray-dried powders suspended in saline was combined to provide an aerodynamic diameter. The aerodynamic behaviour was investigated using an Andersen cascade impactor. The difference in analysis methods could also explain the difference in results, but it is very likely that the low moisture content seen in this study provides a significant reduction in particle aggregation leading to the different conclusions. The redispersibility of non-loaded NPs from the spraydried powders were successfully demonstrated for the developed method of spray drying for each of the three different excipients, and it is highly likely that the results for siRNA-loaded NPs spray dried with mannitol will also apply for nanocomposite particles with the remaining two excipients.",

            "text": "The surface morphology of the produced nanocomposite microparticles was also investigated. There was a difference in surface corrugation when the content of NPs was varied. Some degree of surface corrugation has been shown to be beneficial for particles intended for inhalation, and it is suggested that the improved aerosolization properties of corrugated particles is not only due to the lower aerodynamic particle size but also to a reduction in interparticulate cohesion [31, 32] . Surface corrugation has also been reported to reduce the influence of the inhaler device on the aerosol generation [32] . Even a small degree of corrugation is sufficient to obtain the described effects [31] . Corrugated particles might also be more appropriate for dissolution in the lung fluid due to a larger surface area. This could be an advantage in the case of the nanocomposite microparticles since the rapid release of the NPs into the lung fluid is necessary to avoid macrophage clearance. The discovered possibility of modifications of the surface corrugation in the nanocomposite microparticles represents an interesting possibility for further optimisation of the system for delivery by inhalation. In addition, since the siRNA-containing NPs were produced by a modified version of the double emulsion solvent evaporation method, the size of the NPs can easily be modified to provide smaller particles by making small changes to the production method. Smaller NPs could possibly minimize loss by macrophage clearance of released NPs following inhalation [10, 11] .",

            "text": "Importantly, the data confirms that the siRNA is preserved during the spray drying process. The siRNA extracted from the microparticles was shown to be of the same size as before spray drying when analysed by PAGE. To ensure that the biological activity of the siRNA was preserved, two cell transfection studies were performed. The first study showed that the biological activity of the siRNA was retained after spray drying by evaluating the gene silencing effect of siRNA extracted from NPs combined with the commercial transfection reagent lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 5A) . The second study evaluated the silencing efficiency of the NPs before and after spray drying and with or without the addition of lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 5B) . The NPs displayed a good gene silencing efficiency in combination with lipofectamine 2000. However, there was no observable effect with the NPs without lipofectamine. Preliminary results indicate that the lack of silencing activity for the NPs alone might be due to a very slow siRNA release, which can be accelerated in the presence of lipofectamine 2000, resulting in the release of a dose sufficient for gene silencing within the 48 h of the in vitro experiment. No cellular toxicity was observed upon addition of lipofectamine 2000. In addition, the NPs seem to be capable of endosomal escape, which would therefore not be the cause of the lack of silencing in this shortterm cell study. We are currently testing the effect of modified PLGA matrixes on the release profile and the gene knock-down efficiency of the siRNA-loaded NPs. Such modifications should ideally not compromise the favourable safety profile of the polymer, and still enable the preparation of nanocomposite microparticles with optimal characteristics for inhalation therapy.",

At least two mechanisms are suggested to be responsible for this protection: 1) The PLGA matrix protects the siRNA during the spray drying process, and 2) the excipients enhance the in-process stability of the siRNA. The ratio of NPs to excipient was assessed after spray drying in order to eliminate an uneven loss of NPs and carbohydrate excipient as a cause of the decrease in siRNA content. The ratio was not affected by the spray drying, suggesting that the decrease in siRNA content must be due to degradation.",

The NPs used for spray drying were easily redispersed when the nanocomposite microparticles were dissolved in water. The siRNA encapsulated inside the NPs could be extracted and successfully used for gene knockdown in a cell transfection study using a commercial transfection agent. Also, the NPs showed a significant knockdown when mixed with lipofectamine 2000, probably due to a change of the release profile making the silencing measurable in a short term in vitro study. The ratio of NPs to excipient was found to have a significant effect on the surface morphology of the spray-dried nanocomposite microparticles. This discovery could provide the basis for further optimisation of the nanocomposite microparticles with respect to aerosolization properties. This study has proven for the first time that it is possible to obtain a spray-dried formulation containing siRNA with characteristics known to be optimal for inhalation therapy, without compromising the activity of the siRNA. Future work will address the preparation and in vivo test of this type of nanocomposite microparticles.",
