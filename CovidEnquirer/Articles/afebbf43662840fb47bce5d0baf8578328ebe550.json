It was found to be the major serum antibody in hens, and termed IgY due to its enrichment in egg yolk (Leslie and Clem, 1969) . Since then, the avian immune system, and IgY, has been studied extensively, revealing many important characteristics and applications of IgY. The laying hen is an ethical alternative for the production of large quantities of specific antibodies at a low cost (Schade and Hlinak, 1996) . Owing to its favorable immunochemical characteristics when compared to mammalian IgG, IgY has found many applications in the medical and research fields, including areas such as diagnostics and biomarker discovery. IgY has perhaps received the most attention for its immunotherapeutic potential.",

            "text": "The use of chickens for antibody production provides several advantages over the conventional method of IgG production in mammals. Antibody production in chickens is much less invasive, requiring only the collection of eggs, rather than the collection of blood, and therefore is less stressful on the animal (Fig. 17 .2) (Karlsson et al., 2004) . Owing to the genetic distance between chickens and mammals, it is possible to produce antibodies against highly conserved mammalian proteins that otherwise would not be possible in mammals. In contrast to mammalian systems, much less antigen is required to produce an efficient immune response, and sustained high antibody titers reduce the need for frequent injections (Larsson et al., 1998) . In fact, it has been estimated that the productivity of antibodies in hens is nearly 18 times greater than that in rabbits, based on the weight of antibody produced per animal (Nakai et al., 1994) , which translates to an overall reduction in animal use for the same level of antibody production. A laying hen typically lays around 240-280 eggs per year (Sim et al., 2000) , and an egg yolk contains 100-150 mg of IgY. Therefore, around 28-42 g of IgY per year may be obtained from a single chicken (Karlsson et al., 2004) .",

Both IgG and IgY contain Asn-linked oligosaccharides; however, the structure of oligosaccharides in IgY differ from those of any mammalian IgG, containing instead unusual monoglucosylated oligomannose-type oligosaccharides with Glc 1 Man 7-9 GlcNAc 2 structure (Ohta et al., 1991; Matsuura et al., 1993) . The isoelectric point of IgY is lower than that of IgG (Polson et al., 1980) , IgY does not associate with mammalian complement, and the binding of IgY with human and bacterial Fc-receptors on cell surfaces is less than that of IgG (Gardner and Kaye, 1982) .

However, the stability of IgY under various processing and physiological conditions needs to be considered when they are to be used in industrial, food or medical applications (Shimizu et al., 1993b) . IgY is stable in the pH range of 4-9, and up to temperatures of 65 \u00b0C (Shimizu et al., 1992; , however this range may be extended by the addition of stabilizers such as sugars, complex carbohydrates, or polyols (Shimizu et al., 1994; Chang et al., 2000; . IgY is relatively resistant to treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin, but sensitive to pepsin digestion (Shimizu et al., 1988) . Hatta et al. (1993b) found that almost all of the IgY activity was lost following digestion with pepsin; however, activity remained even after 8 hours incubation with trypsin or chymotrypsin.",

In order to circumvent the inactivation of IgY following oral administration, a number of encapsulation techniques have been examined. The microencapsulation of IgY using liposomes (Shimizu et al., 1993a) and multiple emulsions (Shimizu and Nakane, 1995) have been previously described; however, these have shown limited effectiveness, in some cases destroying antibody activity by the encapsulation procedure itself. The macroencapsulation of IgY using enteric-coated gelatin capsules has also been examined, and was found to significantly improve antibody stability (Akita and Nakai, 2000) . The use of a pH-sensitive methacrylic acid copolymer and chitosan-alginate microcapsules (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine, 2005; Li et al., 2007 Li et al., , 2009a have also been shown to increase IgY stability to gastric conditions both in vitro as well as in vivo.",

Specific IgY, which can easily be produced on a large scale required for industrial applications, would provide an ideal replacement for other polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies currently used in immunoaffinity chromatography (Li-Chan, 2000) . Although IgY is more sensitive to low pH than IgG, it was found that an IgY immunoaffinity column was capable of retaining stability when subjected to standard affinity chromatography conditions, and could be reused over 50 times without a significant decrease in binding capacity (Akita and Li-Chan, 1998) .",

Immunoaffinity fractionation is one of the most effective methods used during sample preparation to improve the ability to detect low-abundance proteins (Huang and Fang, 2008) .

            "text": "Antibodies serve as essential components in a variety of diagnostic assays used for the qualitative and quantitative determination of a wide range of substances (Schade and Hlinak, 1996) . While the antigen-binding specificity of IgY is comparable to that of IgG (Hatta et al., 1997b) , IgY presents several advantages that make it well suited for applications in medical diagnostics. A number of proteins exist whose amino acid sequences are well preserved among mammals, and when used as an antigen in mammals have limited or no antigenicity (Hatta et al., 2008) . Evolutionary differences allow the production of high avidity IgY against conserved mammalian proteins, with a more diversified antibody repertoire than is possible in mammals (Olovsson and Larsson, 1993; Woolley and Landon, 1995; Carlander et al., 1999a) . The use of IgY as a substitute for IgG in clinical testing can potentially eliminate false positives and often results in low background and less interference (Xiao and Gao, 2010) . Human serum samples often contain an active complement system, which would be activated by mammalian antibodies. IgY, which does not activate the human complement system, eliminates the interference that would otherwise be caused by IgG (Larsson and Mellstedt, 1992) . Human serum can also contain rheumatoid factor (RF) and human anti-mouse IgG antibodies (HAMA), which are well-known causes of false-positive reactions in immunological assays (Carlander et al., 1999a) . RF reacts with the Fc portion of IgG, and HAMA, which can occur naturally in human serum, will bind to any mouse antibodies being used in an immunoassay (Carlander et al., 1999a) . Since IgY does not react with RF (Larsson and Sjoquist, 1988; Larsson et al., 1991) or HAMA (Larsson and Mellstedt, 1992) , it has been suggested as a replacement for IgG in immunological assays of human serum.",

IgY against S. mutans was examined for the passive prevention of dental caries (Hamada et al., 1991; Otake et al., 1991; Chang et al., 1999) , and it was found that supplementation of 2% IgY-containing yolk powder to a cariogenic diet significantly lowered caries scores. Likewise, levels of S. mutans were decreased in volunteers who gargled with a mouth rinse containing anti-S. mutans IgY (Hatta et al., 1997c) . IgY produced against the S. mutans glucan binding protein B (GBP-B), which is believed to be involved in S. mutans biofilm development, has also been examined. Using a rat model of dental caries, Smith et al.

Salmonella possesses several surface components which are virulence related, including outer membrane protein (OMP) (Isibasi et al., 1988) , flagella (Fla) and, in some strains, fimbrial antigens (Thorns et al., 1990 (Thorns et al., , 1992 . The ability of IgY specific for OMP, LPS or flagella (Fla), to passively protect against experimental salmonellosis in mice has been demonstrated. In vitro using a cultured human intestinal cell line (Caco-2), Chalghoumi et al. (2009) found that IgY against OMP of SE and ST reduced the Salmonella-induced decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of the infected Caco-2 cell monolayers and blocked Salmonella sp. adhesion in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that passive immunization with Salmonella OMP-specific IgY could be useful to prevent Salmonella colonization in broiler chickens and the subsequent carcass contamination during processing. In vivo in mice challenged with SE or ST, treatment with IgY against OMP, LPS or Fla resulted in a significantly higher survival rate when compared to control mice (Yokoyama et al., 1998b) . Salmonella infection in calves is also a significant problem, with ST and S. dublin accounting for most cases of salmonellosis. Passive protection against ST and S. dublin was investigated by challenging calves with SE or S. dublin, and then orally administering anti-SE or anti-S. dublin IgY. All control calves died within 7-10 days, whereas only fever and diarrhea were observed in calves given the high titer IgY (Yokoyama et al., 1998a) .",

Finally, the production and testing of IgY against influenza virus H5N1 and H1N1 has also been described.

            "text": "Transgenic pigs are promising donor organisms for xenotransplantation as they share many anatomical and physiological characteristics with humans (Klymiuk et al., 2010) ; however one of the most important barriers with such xenografts is hyperacute rejection, mediated by natural antibodies in humans against pig antigens, complement fixation, and the rapid onset of intravascular coagulation (Sandrin and McKenzie, 1994) . The major target of these natural antibodies is the carbohydrate epitope, Gala1-3Gal, which is expressed by all mammals except for humans, apes, and some monkeys. Besides humans and monkeys, chickens also lack Gala1-3Gal expression (Bouhours et al., 1998) . Since IgY does not bind human complement or Fc-receptors, anti-a-Gal IgY may be a suitable candidate for use as blocking antibodies to inhibit the interactions that may contribute to xenograft rejection. Fryer et al. (1999) demonstrated that anti-a-Gal IgY blocked human xenoreactive antibody binding to both porcine and rat tissues in vitro, and inhibited lysis of porcine cells by human serum, suggesting that IgY could be of potential use in inhibiting pig-to-human xenograft rejection. Anti-a-Gal IgY was also found to significantly reduce the infectivity of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), an a-Gal bearing virus which has emerged as a potential zoonotic agent, with possible pig-to-human transmission (Leventhal et al., 2001) .",

            "text": "The production of IgY in chickens and the extraction of specific antibodies from egg yolk is increasingly attracting the interest of the scientific community, as evidenced by the significant growth in the amount of IgY-related literature (Schade et al., 2005) . Indeed, the immunization of hens represents an ideal alternative to efficiently generate large quantities of polyclonal antibodies since housing is inexpensive, egg collection is non-stressful and noninvasive, and the isolation and purification of IgY is relatively simple and high-yielding (Zhang, 2003) . Recently, it has also been suggested that the selective transport of IgY from the blood into the egg yolk may also provide a new strategy for delivering substances into the egg yolk in an attempt to produce designer eggs (Bae et al., 2010) , and may further expand the application of IgY. Immunization protocols and adjuvant systems continue to be modified in order to increase specific antibody production, and the identification and production IgY against of new antigens will continue to lead to new applications of egg yolk antibodies for human health and research applications.
