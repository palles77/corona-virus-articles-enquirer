All 6 palm civets at the restaurant were positive for SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Partial spike (S) gene sequences of SARS-CoV from the 2 patients were identical to 4 of 5 S gene viral sequences from palm civets. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SARS-CoV from palm civets in the restaurant was most closely related to animal isolates. SARS cases at the restaurant were the result of recent interspecies transfer from the putative palm civet reservoir, and not the result of continued circulation of SARS-CoV in the human population.",

Early casepatients were more likely to be persons with occupational exposure to animals, such as animal sellers or restaurant cooks (1, 2) . Tracing the source of infection has been complicated, given the sporadic nature of index cases without a clear history of contact with animals. After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the end of the SARS epidemic, 4 new cases of SARS were reported from December 16, 2003, to January 1, 2004 , in Guangzhou in Guangdong Province. These cases were not linked to any laboratory accidents. All patients had a temperature >38\u00b0C, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and serologic evidence of SARS infection. Fever lasted from 6 to 18 days (median 7), no mechanical ventilation was required, and the clinical course of the disease ranged from 21 to 24 days with full recovery. All 4 patients had communityacquired infections without any apparent epidemiologic link. A total of 257 contacts, including 113 close contacts, of these patients were observed for 2 weeks, with no secondary transmission identified. These patients had mild symptoms and no secondary transmission, which was remarkably different from patients in the 2003 epidemic.",

However, 1 of these patients reported no contact with palm civets or other animals in the preceding 2 months. The second patient was a 20-year-old waitress from a restaurant that served palm civets as food (4, 5) . Based on the virologic and epidemiologic findings, provincial officials took aggressive action on January 5, 2004, ordering a sweep through farms and food markets to destroy any animals that might harbor SARS-CoV. No additional SARS cases have since been reported. This information highlights the necessity for investigating restaurants as a possible source of infection, understanding that the virus can be transmitted from animals or environmental sources to humans, and clarifying the genetic basis of pathogenicity and infectivity of SARS-CoV from animal sources.",

However, we lack evidence that eating civet could transmit the virus because the employees had not eaten palm civet before SARS developed.

This situation may be similar to those earliest index cases linked to markets or restaurants that occurred in winter of 2002-2003 (18) .

These findings support our observations that SARS-like illness did not develop in any of the 257 contacts of the 4 patients, or in any of the health care workers attending them. However, epidemiologic data can only provide clues to the biologic characteristics of the virus. Therefore, experimental infection using animal models is necessary to measure the relative pathogenic potential of various strains of SARS-CoV isolated from human and animals.
