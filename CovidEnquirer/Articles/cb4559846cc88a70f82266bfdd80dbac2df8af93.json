            "text": "Purpose: To assess the utility of \"influenza-like illness\" (ILI) and whether it appropriately tests influenza vaccine effectiveness. Principal results: The WHO and CDC definitions of \"influenza-like illness\" are similar. However many studies use other definitions, some not specifying a temperature and requiring specific respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, making many samples non-comparable. Most ILI studies find less than 25% of cases are RT-PCR-positive, those which test for other viruses and bacteria usually find multiple other pathogens, and most identify no pathogen in about 50% of cases. ILI symptom and symptom combinations do not have high sensitivity or specificity in identifying PCR-positive influenza cases. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are increasingly used to screen ILI cases and they have low sensitivity and high specificity when compared to RT-PCR in identifying influenza. Main conclusions: The working diagnosis of ILI presumes influenza may be involved until proven otherwise. Health care workers would benefit by renaming the WHO and CDC ILI symptoms and signs as \"acute respiratory illness\" and also using the WHO acute severe respiratory illness definition if the illness is severe and meets this criterion. This renaming would shift attention to identify the viral and bacterial pathogens in cases and epidemics, identify new pathogens, implement vaccination plans appropriate to the identified pathogens, and estimate workload during the viral season. Randomised controlled trials testing the effectiveness of influenza vaccine require all participants to be assessed by a gold standard (RT-PCR). ILI has no role in measuring influenza vaccine effectiveness. ILI is well established in the literature and in the operational definition of many surveillance databases and its imprecise definition may be inhibiting progress in research and treatment. The current ILI definition could with benefit be renamed \"acute respiratory illness,\" with additional definitions for \"severe acute respiratory illness\" (SARI) with RT-PCR testing for pathogens to facilitate prevention and treatment. also varied over time. The French nationwide Sentinelles system reports ILI cases during influenza epidemics and found 1999-2012 that A(H3N2) predominated in seven epidemics (82-99% of all isolations), A(H1N1) (58-99%) in four and B in two (48-55%) [3].",

They vary in using WHO or CDC definitions or their own. (Table 1) . Two were in the US. In a retrospective study of 32,922 patients seen for acute respiratory problems in a US emergency department 2009-2010 1233 were tested for respiratory viruses by RT-PCR, 773 met the CDC ILI definition and 12.5% were positive for A H1N1, and the sensitivity of the CDC ILI definition was 79.2% and specificity 57.5%. The CDC definition excludes proven other causes and when patients were tested for four common alternative diagnoses 13.5% had a chest X-ray positive for acute bacterial pneumonia, 6.7% a positive rapid RSV antigen, 0.3% a rapid streptococcal throat culture and 0.2% a positive Mononucleosis spot test and the sensitivity of the CDC definition increased to 86.4% and specificity declined to 40.7% [9] [11] . Two studies were in China. At Peking University People's Hospital all patients \u226516 years at the fever outpatient service during 2010 were screened for WHO ILI, 279 were tested by RT-PCR and 23.7% were positive for Influenza A, 0.7% Influenza B, 1.1% Rhinoviruses, 1.1% Adenovirus, 0.7% Coronaviruses, 0.4% RSV, and 2.5% multiple viruses [12] . A study assessed whether China's national ILI sentinel surveillance system (554 sentinel hospitals across China, 2.5% of all hospitals) could identify new strains. In 2013 laboratory systems reported 130 cases of A/H7N9 but only five were first identified by the sentinel system [13] . Table 2 ). Four studies were in Asia. In India trained investigators assessed all 10,080 patients admitted to hospitals over two years: of the 3179 ILI cases, 13% <5 years and 22% \u2265 5 years were Influenza A PCR positive and 6% Influenza B. For children <5 years the SARI definition had a very low sensitivity of 11% and a high specificity of 87%. If shortness of breath was omitted sensitivity increased to 69% and specificity decreased to 43%, if reported fever was allowed sensitivity increased to 87% and specificity decreased to 5%, and if cough was added sensitivity decreased to 77% but specificity increased to 33% [14] . A study of the H1N1 epidemic in Singapore June-October 2009 found paired samples from 727 ILI cases yielded an influenza estimate of 17% (Bayesian CIs 14-20%) and an average of baseline and final samples a rate of 15% (BCI 10 to 25%) [15] . A study in Vietnam 2006-2010 of 15 sites in the National Influenza Sentinel System identified 29,804 ILI cases: 14.5% were Influenza A and 7.3% B, and there were 12 peaks during the five year period [16] . A study of 15 African countries 2006-2010 reported 69,860 WHO ILI cases: 21.7% tested RT-PCR positive for influenza (range Angola 6.9%-40.4% Madagascar) but there was a low adult consultation rate [17] . Thus in studies with WHO or CDC ILI definitions there was a wide range of viruses, some bacteria, and influenza rates were usually <25%.",

Asymptomatically infected persons can shed detectable influenza virus and may transmit influenza to others, although data supporting the frequency of transmission prior to symptoms is limited\" and \"In most instances, individual cases of influenza are difficult to identify reliably by clinical examination and routine clinical laboratory findings alone, and the appropriate use of influenza diagnostic tests is helpful.\" [36] ILI can be caused by more than 200 viral species, and patients \"exhibit widely overlapping symptoms, rendering clinical diagnosis unreliable. . .\" [23] ILI patients tended to have rates of the three key ILI symptoms of fever, cough and sore throat above 70%, but there were several studies which reported symptoms at the 40% level (Table 3) , which could be due to differences in the illness of the patients or questioning by the health care professionals. The Marseille 2009 H1N1 pandemic study demonstrated the remarkable similarity of influenza A/H1N1p and human rhinovirus symptoms: 75% had ILI symptoms (89% of H1N1p cases, 74% HRV) and similar percentages of other symptoms [11] . Some studies assessed up to 14 other symptoms, which showed a wide range of variation (Table 3) . Several studies assessed which symptoms predicted a positive laboratory test for influenza. Schnepf's study of French ILI patients found that patients with no virus detected were less likely to have a cough (77.8%) than those with H1N1v (89.5%, p = 0.01) and more likely to have pharyngitis (21%) compared to those with H1N1v (10%, p = 0.003), but Schnepf was not able to predict PCR-positivity [19] . The Hutterite colony study found that combinations of fever, cough, sore throat and muscle aches predicted PCR influenza positivity, but the confidence intervals were wide [27] . The Indian Council of Medical Research influenza surveillance network study found that only three symptoms correlated with influenza PCR-positivity: cough (p < 0.0034), fatigue (p < 0.001) and chills/rigours (p < 0.001). The 2068 with SARI also had wide variation in symptoms and only body ache correlated with influenza PCR-positivity [32] . The Belgian general practitioner network ILI study enquired about 16 symptoms (but did not report fever) and noted that the most frequent symptoms for the 426 with confirmed influenza were similar to those for RSV [18] . The Portuguese study found that only fever \u226538 \u2022 C correlated with laboratory-proven influenza [31] . The San Diego military study 2007-2008 found for that acute onset \u22643 days, T > 38 \u2022 C, cough, and body aches all correlated p \u2264 0.001 with PCR proven influenza [30] . In Australia different definitions were used for two states and different definitions for two years for Western Australia. For the combination cough, fever, fatigue and myalgia sensitivity ranged from 34.8 to 72.1% and specificity from 46.6% to 86.9%, and for cough and fever sensitivity ranged from 56.5 to 88.5% and specificity from 27.6 to 61.7% [26] . A systematic review in 2005 identified seven studies of influenza symptoms and no symptom or sign had a summary likelihood ratio high >2, and cough, nasal congestion or no fever were the only signs with a likelihood ratio <0.5 that decreased the likelihood of influenza [36] . A study of 964 Amsterdam patients used the Netherlands Medical Assistance for Accidents and Disasters ILI definition and tested them by RT-PCR. The CDC, WHO, and UK Health Protection Agency ILI definitions were also tested and the average sensitivity was 66% and specificity 70%. The authors concluded that all four case definitions \"seemed comparable but rather useless.\" [20] A review of 15 studies 1997-2007 found the sensitivity of clinical diagnosis compared to viral culture or RT-PCR was 65% (55%-74%) and the specificity 67% (57%-76%), but the studies showed marked heterogeneity (I 2 = 95.4) [37] . ILI cases thus show wide variation in symptom frequency. Although fever and cough correlate positively with PCR-proven influenza in many studies, there is a ceiling effect as fever and cough are often >70% or even 90%, and the predictive value is not strong enough to rely on them to discriminate from PCR negative cases. Symptoms and symptom combinations vary between studies and do not provide statistically stable patterns to predict which ILI patients have influenza or other pathogens.",

            "text": "Several factors improve diagnostic test accuracy. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and washes followed by nasopharyngeal swabs and mid-turbinate swabs from each nostril provide higher yields than throat swabs. Flocked swabs release samples into transport media better than mattress swabs. Samples obtained within 2-4 days of symptom onset provide higher yields than those in the first 12 h. RT-PCR is more sensitive than culture because it does not require infectious virus, and remains positive longer in transport. Results in experienced laboratories which monitor test performance are better [38] . Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are increasingly used for ILI screening. Sixteen studies 2002-2009 of the QuickVue Rapid Flu test found marked heterogeneity (I 2 = 92.5%). Compared to viral culture or RT-PCR random-effects sensitivity was 72% (62%, 81%) and specificity 96% (93%, 97%) [37] . A study of the patients in six US states found the Quidel QuickVue A + B test had 59% sensitivity and 97% specificity compared to RT-PCR [29] . A meta-analysis of 159 studies (35% during the H1N1 pandemic) of 26 RIDTs found many methodological defects: only 33% defined recruitment criteria, 41% were blinded, and 13% provided information on symptom duration. The RIDT was compared to RT-PCR in 54% of studies, to viral culture in 43% and to both in 3%. RT-PCR is more sensitive than culture, and RIDT pooled sensitivities compared to RT-PCR were lower (53.9%; 48.2%, 59.6%) than compared to viral culture (72.3%; 66.8%, 7.9%). RIDT specificity was high (98.8%; 98.3%, 99.3%) compared to RT-PCR and (96.7%; 95.2%, 98.3%) compared to viral culture. Sensitivity was higher in children (66.6%; 61.6%, 71.7%) than adults (53.9%; 47.9%, 59.8%) because they have higher viral loads and shed longer. Sensitivity was also higher in Influenza A (64.6%; 59.0%, 70.1%) compared to Influenza B (52.2%; 45.0%, 59.3%) [39] . There are few head-tohead comparisons of RIDTs. Directigen Flu A had the highest pooled sensitivity (76.7%; 63.8%, 86%) but it was not statistically better than the next best test (QuickVue Influenza Test), and Directigen Flu A + B (p = 0.011), QuickVue Influenza A + B (p < 0.001) and BinaxNOW (p = 0.028) were statistically inferior to the other RIDTs combined [39] . Seven FDA-approved RIDTs were tested for their ability to detect variant Influenza A viruses, and all detected the seasonal A/Georgia/01/2011 and six of the seven detected H1N1pdm09 A/California/04/2009, but only four detected all A(H3N2)v viruses and at different concentrations [40] . Thus RIDTs have high specificities but very variable and modest sensitivities, and if used to assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccines inaccuracy will be introduced.",

Thus hearing \"influenza\" as the only pathogen in the ILI definition may cause inappropriate certainty in the public, politicians, decision-makers and health professionals that influenza is the cause of far more acute respiratory illnesses than is true. The use of the ILI concept reduces the focus of the public and health professionals' attention on proven measures to reduce the transmission of all acute respiratory pathogens. Because influenza vaccines and anti-viral medications have no effect on the other 200+ viruses and pathogens involved in acute respiratory illness there is a diversion of societal, medical and financial resources away from interrupting the transmission cycles of other pathogens and suggests to patients, health care workers, organisers and funders that anticipation of influenza pandemics, the prevention of influenza by vaccines and treatment by influenza-specific anti-virals are the key activities for health systems. Attention also needs to be given to detecting which pathogens are circulating and using proven barrier and hygiene methods to prevent transmission of as many pathogens as possible, which would also reduce the overall workload of the medical system.",

Renaming would focus on funding the identification of all viral and bacterial epidemics. Randomised controlled trials testing the effectiveness of influenza vaccines require all participants to be assessed by a gold standard (RT-PCR) and follow patients for long enough to measure influenzaspecific mortality. ILI has no role in measuring influenza vaccine effectiveness. ILI is well established in the literature and the operational definition of many surveillance databases. However, would tuberculosis specialists accept a definition that included many unrelated pathogens? Imprecise definitions inhibit progress in research and treatment. Should ILI be added to the list of 146 once recommended but now contradicted medical practices we should stop using and rename it? [45] .",

A study of 1855 persons who crossed the US/Mexico border 2004-2009 who met the CDC ILI definition and were tested by viral culture or PCR found that 19% were Influenza A positive, 4.5% Influenza B, 4% Adenovirus, 1% Parainfluenzavirus, 1% Picornavirus, 0.6% RSV, 0.4% Enterovirus or HSV, and 7% bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, \u2424-hemolytic streptococcus, group C streptococcus or Moraxella catarrhalis) [10]. One study was in Europe. In Marseille during the 2009 H1N1p pandemic a GP network assessed 660 patients as CDC ILI cases and by RT-PCR 24% were A/H1N1p positive. Of the 502 RT-PCR influenza-negative patients a random sample of 296 were tested for 18 viruses: 82 were positive for \u22651 other virus (20% Rhinovirus, 3% Parainfluenza viruses, 3% Coronoavirus, 1.4% Adenovirus, 1.3% Herpes viruses, 0.7% human Metapneumovirus, 0.4% Enterovirus) and 46.2% were negative for all 18",
