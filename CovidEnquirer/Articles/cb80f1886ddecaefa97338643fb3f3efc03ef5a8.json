All members are part of the subfamily Caninae, which is the only extant group of three subfamilies in the fossil record of this family. Evidence suggests that the Eastern wolf should be considered a distinct wolf species (Canis lycaon) that is more closely related to the red wolf (C. rufus) than to the gray wolf of which it has been historically considered a subspecies (C. lupus lycaon). 21 The most common canid, the domestic dog, derived from the gray wolf (C. lupus) through close association and interactions with humans approximately 12,000 years ago. The dingo and the New Guinea singing dog are considered feral populations of domestic dogs that have reverted to a wild status and are thus considered subspecies of C. lupus.",

The red fox, which is present on five continents, and the gray wolf, present on three, span some of the largest geographic ranges of any terrestrial mammal. Canids have diversified to inhabit a wide variety of habitat types. Species occur in desert environments, savannas, tropical and temperate forests, coastal areas, and arctic environments. Individual species range in size from members of the Vulpes genus weighing 1 kilogram (kg) or less, to subspecies of the gray wolf exceeding 60 kg. Sexual dimorphism occurs in a majority of species, and males are typically larger. Some species are solitary, some form monogamous or seasonally monogamous pairs, whereas others have large, complex packs of multiple generations within a social unit. Large packs of some species make formidable and efficient units capable of preying on larger animals and fending off predators. Many smaller canids forage for prey alone, in pairs, or in small groups. Some species such as the coyote (C. latrans) exhibit extreme social flexibility, being capable of existing as solitary individuals, in pairs, or in large complex packs.",

Chemical restraint is recommended for prolonged or invasive procedures involving most large canids.",

Box traps have been successfully used for trapping wild canids and are considered more humane and less stressful than other alternatives 47 but are less effective for capturing the majority of wild canid species. Foothold traps (metal \"jaw\" traps and cable \"noose\" restraint devices) 6 are used to capture wild canids, specifically wolves, foxes, and dholes, although their use has been outlawed in some countries. Traps should be properly padded and inspected to ensure proper functioning and minimal risk to the animal. Every consideration should be made for humane usage and exclusion of nontarget species. Foothold traps may cause injuries to the feet, legs and teeth, 32 and individuals may develop hyperthermia or myopathy if restraint is prolonged. When initially restrained, some animals may actively dig and pull against the trap and may self-mutilate in trying to escape. If multiple traps are set within a short distance, an animal may be caught in more than one trap, or the mechanism may close around nontarget body parts as the animal rolls, pulls, and tries to escape from the primary restraint. The use of remote monitoring devices (e.g., motion sensors, cameras, and remote alarms that link to personal communication devices) has greatly improved the ability to minimize restraint time, and their use information is lacking for most species' needs. Canine diets based on raw meat are commercially available and form the basis of captive diets for some species, whereas others may be maintained on dry kibble. Dietary intolerance manifested by gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, skin reactions, poor pelage, and cachexia have been reported in individuals that are maintained on cereal-based or highly processed grain diets. Omnivorous canids probably require high amounts of dietary fiber and may benefit from the addition of natural fiber sources to their diet, including produce and fruit.",

Feeding whole or partial carcasses of wild or domestic ungulates often is used to stimulate pack behaviors and for social enrichment. Caution should be exercised to ensure that the carcasses are fresh, free of parasitic or other diseases, and harvested by using methods that do not contain harmful substances (such as lead shot, euthanasia solution, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], or toxins). Additional caution should be exercised in areas where prion diseases (such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE] or chronic wasting disease [CWD]) are present, since carnivore species may be susceptible to prion-associated neurologic disease. The USDA Animal Welfare Act (Section 13, 9 CFR, Subsection F, Section 3.129) specifically discourages feeding roadkill to large felids but outlines guidelines for proper handling if it must be fed. The same guidelines are applicable to canids. If whole carcasses are fed to animals intended for reintroduction, only carcasses from natural prey species should be offered, and domestic animal carcasses should never be offered, as canids will likely learn to recognize the species offered as possible prey items. 35 It has been suggested that the maned wolf has lower animal protein needs compared with other canids. 35 Scat studies of wild maned wolves suggest that plant material may account for 50% of their diet, with small mammals, insects, and birds accounting for the rest. 8 Taurine levels should be monitored in captive maned wolves, and supplementation may be necessary on an individual basis. 8 A soy-based pelleted diet has been commercially developed specifically for captive maned wolves, and preliminary results of experimental feeding show improved fecal consistency and body condition scores.",

GDV is an acute, lifethreatening condition and often is recognized on postmortem examination following unexpected and sudden death. The antemortem diagnosis of GDV and GD is made on the basis of clinical signs and appearance and confirmed by radiography. The predisposing factors in these species are unknown, but the same risk factors as in domestic dogs have been considered, including the protein source of the diet, the kibble size, the amount of food offered, and the individual' s age. Feeding an animal shortly after an anesthetic event has been anecdotally linked to GDV. Prompt recognition is vital to survival, and surgical intervention is the only way to correct GDV. All known parasitic diseases of domestic dogs are likely to affect wild canids within a certain geographic range. Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Eimeria, and Isospora are often seen in nondomestic canids; clinical signs are similar to those seen in domestic dogs and are most significant in juveniles. Babesiosis has been reported in maned wolves in the United States 31 and in South America. 4 Roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms affect all canids and are suspected to be pathogenic in pups, but clinical disease is often absent in adults. Dirofilaria immitis (the cause of heartworm disease) may affect all canid species, although it has been suspected that other parasites may cause cardiac infections. Cardiac ultrasonography detected adult nematodes, suggesting the presence of heartworms in the right pulmonary arteries of two maned wolves that had been prophylactically treated with ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg, orally [PO], monthly) for 2 years prior to detection. Neither wolf showed signs of clinical infection, and blood-based screening tests had been negative for both animals. 10 Trichinosis has been diagnosed in wild Arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus), and infection is often attributed to feeding on polar bear carcasses.",

Close monitoring of maned wolves for stranguria is an essential part of the routine care of this species. Pododermatitis may cause significant morbidity in canids 35 and is an important disease in neonates. Because of their predisposition to dig, many canids suffer traumatic lesions to their pads, including abrasions, pad or nail avulsions, and lacerations. Wounds may become infected, often leading to pododermatitis. Neonates housed on rough surfaces or den boxes may dig or repeatedly push aside bedding material, leading to lesions that often get infected because of the limited mobility of the neonates. Staphylococcus spp. and gramnegative bacteria often invade pododermatitic lesions and likely reflect contamination from the adjacent skin or of enteric origin. Interdigital dermatitis and edema have been seen in maned wolves, Mexican gray wolves, fennec foxes (Vulpes zerda), and other species. Although the etiology is unknown, tissues between the digits and pads on the plantar surface become erythematous, abraded, and moist. Some of these lesions may be the result of excessive moisture leading to dermatitis and resolve with appropriate disinfection and oral antimicrobials. In some instances, biopsy of nonhealing lesions has been suggestive of an auto-immune component and has responded to treatment with oral prednisone in addition to antibiotics.",

Most canids exhibit monogamy, exceptionally long proestrous and diestrous phases, a copulatory lock, behavioral suppression of mating in the subordinate young within a social group, and obligate pseudopregnancy in subordinate females. 2 Most wild canids are seasonal breeders, but notable exceptions exist in the small or tropical canids such as bushdogs, in which the females do not have a rigid, single breeding cycle. 8 Some species may naturally exhibit seasonality in the wild, but not in captivity, and the seasonality of tropical species may be dependent on prey cycles, which follow seasonal rainfall. 2 Mounting evidence suggests that some species, notably the smaller canid species, likely have induced estrus cycles. 3 The copulatory lock is an important mechanism in canid mating behavior, and it may be extremely prolonged in some species such as the fennec fox, with a mean duration of almost 2 hours. 43 but the eggs are shed in canid feces and ingested by an intermediate or aberrant host where clinical signs may occur. Three Echinoccoccus species (E. granulosus, E. multilocularis, and E. vogeli) maintain their cycles through a definite canid host and its herbivorous prey (rodents, rabbits, sheep, goats, deer, camels, macropods). Dipylidium caninum may affect wild canid species, and transmission usually occurs by ingestion of fleas. 18 Pancreatic flukes (Eurytrema procyonis) have been documented in maned wolves in the Midwestern United States 15 and in foxes throughout the United States. Clinical signs are associated with maldigestion and include weight loss and poorly formed stools.",

Hypoproteinemia, specifically hypoalbuminemia, is a significant component of the disease, often leading to ascites. Profound hypoalbuminemia and ascites are poor prognostic indicators. IBD is an inflammatory cell infiltration of the lamina propria (typically lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, macrophages, and neutrophils), but the predominance of each cell type may correspond to slightly different disease characterization, prognosis, and treatment needs. The term \"IBD\" should never be used to characterize clinical signs, as these are shared with other conditions. Differential diagnoses include other malabsorption diseases, pancreatic disease (exocrine insufficiency), parasitic and infectious diseases (viruses and bacterial overgrowth), enterocolitis, dietary intolerance, and neoplastic disease. IBD is not synonymous with dietary intolerance or a food allergy to a dietary component.",

Bacteria in the gut lumen and parasitic or dietary agents may serve as antigenic initiators to an excessive, chronic gut immune inflammatory response. A presumptive diagnosis of IBD often is made on the basis of clinical signs after excluding other differential diagnoses, but a confirmatory diagnosis requires gut biopsies. Primary treatment modalities mimic those used in IBD in domestic dogs and require supportive care based on the severity of signs and clinical pathology findings. Immunomodulation (either through corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, or sulfasalazine), dietary modification (hypoallergenic diets, easily digestible diets), antibiotics (to decrease bacterial overgrowth), and supportive care (fluids, possibly colloids in cases of hypoproteinemia) are the main components of therapy. Supplementation of cobalamine and folate may be beneficial.",

            "text": "Cystinuria is a prevalent condition in maned wolves, both in human care and in the wild, and may have a genetic basis. 15 Cystinuria is often subclinical, 15 but the precipitation of calculi in the urinary tract may have life-threatening consequences if urinary obstructions occur. Obstructions are more likely to occur in males (because of the size and length of the urethra) than in females, although cystinuria occurs equally in both sexes. The persistence of cystine crystals in the urinary tract may predispose to urinary tract infections. Long-term (likely lifelong) medical therapy is essential to managing cystinuria. Surgery is indicated in cases of urethral obstructions that cannot be relieved or when large calculi (stones) are present. Medical therapy is aimed at affecting the solubility of cystine to prevent crystal precipitation and stone formation and reducing the concentration of cystine in the urine. Urine alkalinization has been a mainstay of medical management, as urine pH affects the solubility of cystine. Potassium citrate is the preferred urine alkalinization agent. Sodium bicarbonate has been used as a urinary alkalinization agent, but it is not preferred, since sodium intake increases cystine excretion. Dietary manipulation, specifically decreasing Pseudopregnancy is the term used to refer to the prolonged luteal phase following ovulation in canids, which often may be as long as pregnancy. In a pack setting, the hormonal changes associated with pseudopregnancy likely prepare subordinate females to assist in the communal rearing of offspring, and some females may even lactate. 2 Table 46 -5 summarizes the reproductive features of select species.",
