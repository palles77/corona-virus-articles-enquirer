To evaluate possible sources of infection, virus survival was studied in aqueous suspensions and on absorptive and non-absorptive surfaces representative of a hospital environment. Virus susceptibility to chemical disinfection with standard products was also characterized. Virus survived in saline solution for as long as six days but less in culture medium, with or without added cells. After drying, HCoV-229E infectivity was still detectable after 3 h on various surfaces (aluminum, sterile latex surgical gloves, sterile sponges) but HCoV-OC43 survived 1 h or less. Of the various chemical disinfectants tested, Proviodine \u00ae reduced the virus infectious titre by at least 50%. This study suggests that surfaces and suspensions can be considered as possible sources of contamination that may lead to hospital-acquired infections with HCoV and should be appropriately disinfected.",

Human coronaviruses (HCoV), with two known serogroups designated OC43 and 229E, are responsible for up to one-third of common colds. 1 They may also be involved in more serious diseases. For example, we have previously reported hospital-acquired upper respiratory tract infections in premature newborns with apnoea and bradycardia. 2 The incidence of hospitalacquired HCoV infections was estimated at about 25% in a prospective evaluation of hospitalized premature newborns with a gestational age of under 32 weeks. 3 Moreover, in a prospective study of elderly people attending a day care centre, coronavirus 229E was found to be a common cause of hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infection. 4 Prevention of such hospital-acquired infections is based on knowledge of the mode of transmission. The route of entry of HCoV appears to be the nasal mucosa since common colds can be produced after intranasal inoculation of healthy volunteers. 5,6 Infection via the conjunctival mucosa, as described for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), has not been demonstrated for HCoV. Horizontal transmission via small particle aerosols is theoretically possible because airborne HCoV-229E has previously been shown to survive for as long as 86 h under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. 7 Hand contamination from environmental surfaces is also theoretically possible by analogy with RSV 8 and rhinoviruses; 9 however, survival of HCoV on surfaces has not yet been studied.",

Respiratory viruses, such as RSV, 8 rhinovirus 9 and parainfluenza virus 15 have been shown to survive for extended periods in suspensions and on surfaces. Contaminated environmental surfaces are considered to represent a significant vector for hospital-acquired viral infections, which occur frequently in paediatric units. 16 Therefore, appropriate disinfection of surfaces is important for the control and prevention of such cross-infections. Although HCoV were also found to be involved in hospital-acquired infections, 3,4 their survival in the environment had not yet been tested in conditions similar to other respiratory viruses. Therefore, we tested the survival of the two known HCoV strains, 229E and OC43, in suspensions and on surfaces, using laboratory conditions designed to reproduce those found in a hospital environment as well as possible. Table I ) are shown. One hundred percent infectivity represents the infectious titre of virus incubated in PBS in the chemical disinfection assay. The current study demonstrates the survival of a PBS suspension of HCoV for up to six days, with no difference between the two HCoV strains. Culture medium with susceptible cells was tested to mimic human respiratory secretions, without possible interference from contaminating pathogens that might have been found in sputum. These laboratory conditions have been used in previous studies with the same goals as our own. 8, 15 Survival was apparently shorter for these two viruses when incubated in culture medium with or without susceptible cells, when compared with PBS. Presumably, the pH stability of PBS could explain this observation: infectivity of HCoV-229E was previously shown to be optimal at pH 6.0 and to decrease rapidly at pH :5 or 98, while the virus was found to be very stable to cycles of freezing and thawing. 17 We also tested HCoV survival after drying, according to a published protocol, 12 modified in order to test different environmental surfaces which are found in hospitals. In particular, we tested porous and non-porous surfaces since differences in survival according to these types of surfaces were described for other respiratory viruses. 8, 15 As expected, virus survival after drying was shorter than in suspension, without any differences between surfaces or virus strains. Variations according to temperature or humidity were not tested.",

            "text": "Our study indicates that HCoV are able to survive for several days in suspensions and for a few hours after drying. These results are consistent with the possibility of person-to-person virus transmission via hand contamination from surfaces, as described for other respiratory viruses. For example, RSV was recoverable from counter tops for up to 6 h and from rubber gloves for up to 1.5 h. 8 Human rhinovirus type 14 could survive for more than 20 h when incubated in suspension in tryptose phosphate broth, and for a shorter time in bovine mucin or in nasal secretions. 12 Also, parainfluenza virus type 2 could be recovered from non-absorptive surfaces for as long as 10 h if the contaminated site remained moist but only 2 h if it was dry. On absorptive surfaces, survival varied between 2 and 4 h, depending on the material tested. 15 On skin, infectivity of parainfluenza virus decreased rapidly but remained detectable for up to 1 h. 15, 18 On the other hand, RSV could be recovered from a skin surface for not more than 20 min 8 and rhinoviruses could survive for 1-3 h. 9 We have not tested survival of HCoV on human skin because of ethical concerns regarding the risk of acute respiratory tract infection and possible neurological damage. 19, 20 To prevent or reduce the possibility of personto-person transmission of viruses via surfaces, their disinfection is important. Therefore, we tested the disinfecting activity against HCoV of four classes of disinfectants that are widely used in hospitals. We observed that HCoV-OC43 was more sensitive to Proviodine \u00ae than HCoV-229E since it was neutralized with a lower concentration of this chemical disinfectant. The virucidal activity of domestic bleach and soap could not be established because of their inherent cytotoxicity, despite dilution of virusdisinfectant mixtures in PBS or medium. This dilution (1/100) reduced our initial virus titre to 10 3 TCID 50 /mL, so that a 10 4 -fold reduction in the infectious viral titre, as recommended in the German DVV and French Afnor guidelines for assessment of efficacy of disinfectants, 21 was impossible to observe. For RSV, Krilov and Harkness demonstrated a 10 3 -fold reduction with providone-iodine at a 10 93 dilution. 22 The use of 70% ethanol did not allow the detection of virucidal activity since it fixed the virussusceptible cells in the immunoperoxidase assay. The presence of lipids makes enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses more sensitive to disinfection or damage by lipid solvents. Thus, the use of soap and ethanol should be effective since alcohol and detergents destabilize the lipid bilayer of enveloped viruses.",
