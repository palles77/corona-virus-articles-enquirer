Germany has proposed the concept of smart manufacturing to realize the fourth industrial revolution, that is, Industry 4.0 (Qian et al., 2017) . Industry 4.0 is a \"strategic PCAST (2011) focuses in its report on advanced manufacturing, a family of activities that (1) depend on the use and coordination of information, automation, computation, software, sensing, and networking, and/or (2) make use of cutting-edge materials and emerging capabilities enabled by the physical and biological sciences, for example, nanotechnology, chemistry, and biology. According to that report, this involves new ways to manufacture existing products, and especially the manufacture of new products emerging from new advanced technologies Technological change can reduce some risks while aggravating others or even creating new ones (OECD, 2003) . ILO (2010) indicates that in the occupational safety health (OSH) field, recent decades have seen significant technological advances in the workplace, which, together with rapid globalization, have transformed work for many throughout the world. The effects of such changes on OSH have also been significant, so that in some cases, more traditional hazards and risks have been reduced or eliminated, for example, through plant automation, but new technologies have also created new risks (ILO, 2010) .",

And the ISO 45001 standard (the current version is the ISO/DIS 45001.2: 2017) defines an occupational health and safety risk as the combination of the likelihood of an occurrence of a work-related hazardous event or exposure, and the severity of injury or ill health that can be caused by the event or exposure (ISO, 2017a) .

These risks may be relatively low in frequency, but they have broad ramifications of human health, safety and security, the environment, economic well-being, and fabric of societies. IRGC (2010b) aims to shed light on emerging risks with a perspective that has three elements: sources of risk, drivers of risk, and governance issues. IRGC (2010a) defines as emerging a risk that is new, or a familiar risk that becomes apparent in new or unfamiliar conditions. The concept of familiarity assumes the existence of recognizable patterns and management regimes that are relatively stable and have proven to be effective if implemented according to certain rules. By contrast, emerging risks are characterized mainly by uncertainty regarding their potential consequences and/or probabilities of occurrence (IRGC, 2015a) .",

To solve this problem, Brocal and Sebasti\u00e1n (2015a) have developed a new risk model whose objective is to characterize the NER. Nevertheless, this model has two limitations (Brocal et al., 2017) . First, the model does not contemplate the possibility of considering independently the new risks (NR) and increasing risks (IR). Second, this model does not allow monitoring the evolution of NER over time, therefore it is not currently possible to determine, in general, the temporary validity of such risks. In order to solve these problems, Brocal et al. (2017) have developed a theoretical framework for the modeling of the NER that allows its monitoring through the technology lifecycle (TLC), especially in industrial processes. Zhu et al. (2013) considered two major classifications of manufacturing processes: the first by Swift and Booker (2013) classifies processes into casting, cutting, forming, and fabrication. The second by Kalpakjian and Schmid (2010) is more comprehensive; they classify processes into casting, machining and finishing, joining, sheet metal, polymer processing, and bulk deformation processes.",

These authors consider that the flexibility and borderless resources provided by cloud technology motivated manufacturers to take advantage of the cloud application service in an effort to improve and innovate their manufacturing process. The cloud application service provided manufacturers with cloud-based software application, Web-based management dashboard, and cloud-based collaboration, which bring the manufacturing process, management, and monitoring to the cloud, hence the birth of cloud manufacturing (Ooi et al., 2018) .

(2010) state that increased automation involves an increased risk of accidents from human errors, and they usually affect users, butdespecially in the case of high-risk industriesdhave the potential for serious consequences beyond the operator to include fellow workers, the community at large, and the environment. With this increased automation, operator tasks have been reduced from directly controlling the process to monitoring the control systems and controlling them (Chidambaram, 2016) . This drop in hands-on knowledge and responsibility can lead to a lack of sufficient understanding of the underlying process, which can in turn lead to an accident due to someone doing something inappropriate or not knowing what to do when something goes wrong (Stacey et al., 2017) . New technologies, when introduced poorly, entail the risk of increasing operators' mental workload and also of reducing their degree of control over the task, so that if the measures taken are not appropriate increases the risk of negative health effects such as stress and is likely to result in overreliance on automated safety systems (Flasp\u00f6ler et al., 2010) . b. Psychosocial and musculoskeletal risks: these risks are intimately related, and can be studied together or independently, depending on prevention targets. From the joint perspective on new and emerging risks, Flasp\u00f6ler et al. (2010) states that in automated processes, psychosocial and musculoskeletal problems are caused by reduced physical activity, more static postures, and higher mental workload (e.g., when monitoring and controlling); less privacy at work (as technology allows closer and more intrusive supervision); and more decision-making problems.",

The glossary terms are divided into three categories: (1) Terminology on basic concepts; (2) Terminology on related concepts, methods, procedures; and (3) Terminology on risk management actions. The definition of risk governance is one of these key terms. Its definition is the following: risk governance as the application of governance principles to the identification, assessment, management, and communication of risk. Governance refers to the actions, processes, traditions, and institutions by which authority is exercised and decisions are taken and implemented. Risk governance includes the totality of actors, rules, conventions, processes, and mechanisms concerned with how relevant risk information is collected, analyzed, and communicated and management decisions are taken. IRGC Risk Governance Framework (IRGC, 2005) is illustrated in Fig. 2 .4. This framework is divided into three main phases: preevaluation, appraisal, and management.",

In the report on emerging systemic risks developed by the IRGC (2010b), it is indicated that some emerging risks do not prove to be as significant as originally feared, but others may prove to be worse than expected, with a high potential for major losses. In this report it is added that typically, the future consequences of emerging risks cannot be defined in monetary terms, at least not to any satisfactory degree of precision, so the conventional approaches to projecting loss size, relative frequencies, or probability distributions over time or severity of consequences are ineffective. Indeed, it is often difficult to establish causality between the source of the emerging risk and its consequences using conventional technical or scientific data (IRGC, 2010b). Brocal and Sebasti\u00e1n (2015a) have developed a new risk model whose objective is to characterize the NER. This characterization is based on the so-called risk model.

(2017) have developed a theoretical framework for the modeling of the NER that allows its monitoring through the TLC, especially in industrial processes. This new framework allows characterizing and differentiating the new qualities from the increasing qualities associated to risk. With this theoretical framework, Brocal et al. (2018) have designed a technique that is compatible with standards ISO 31000:2009 31000: (ISO, 2009a and ISO/IEC 31010:2009 (ISO, 2009b and permits the NERs generated by a system and its components to be identified and characterized. This technique is called the technique to identify and characterize NERs (TICHNER) and is one of the main results of the Spanish research project A2NERSYS (\"Analysis and Assessment of technological requirements for the design of a New and Emerging Risks standardized management SYStem\"). TICHNER can be applied at any stage of the lifecycle of a manufacturing process and it may also be used in combination with other risk identification techniques (Brocal et al., 2018) .",

CWA 16649: 2013 gives guidance on steps for applying/implementing the proposed emerging risk management framework (ERMF) in industrial organizations. This CWA has a number of additional (informative) parts dealing with emerging risks related to (A) new technologies, (B) new materials, (C) new production processes and new production networks, (D) new policies, (E) uncertainties in measurements and characterization, (F) factors of emergence, (G) used tools, and (H) sample list of emerging risk. Fig. 2.3 shows a diagram with the relationships between annexes A, B, C, and D.iNTeg-Risk 17 of such technologies are proposed as so-called emerging risk representative applications (ERRAs). These ERRAs are considered as sources of \"multiple risk\" in iNTeg-Risk Project (Jovanovi c and Balo s, 2013).
