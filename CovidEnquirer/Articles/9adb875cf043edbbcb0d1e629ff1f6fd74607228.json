The virus is enveloped with a nucleocapsid containing 8 (types A and B) or 7 (type C) segments. Type A subtypes vary in type of hemagglutinin (H1, H2, or H3 subtype), the protein that is important for host cell attachment. Antibodies directed at the hemagglutinin provide human immunity to infection. In addition, the virus possesses either N1 or N2 neuraminidase (N subtype), which also assists viral entry into the host cell and elicits the production of neutralizing antibodies (De Jong et al., 2003) . Influenza is a highly communicable disease transmitted by aerosolized droplet-nuclei produced by coughing and/or sneezing, and by direct contact. All age groups are susceptible to this infection, although the very young, elderly, individuals with chronic medical complications, such as those with compromised pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions, kidney impairment, diabetes or immunosuppressive disorders, and pregnant women in the second and third trimester are at increased risk.",

            "text": "Although the reservoir is primarily human, influenza A viruses have been documented in pigs, horses, seals, ducks, chickens, and whales. Certain subtypes of influenza A are species specific, although all subtypes have been documented in birds. Prominent human subtypes include H1N1, H3N2, H2N2, and H1N2. The influenza A virus has 18 distinct H and 11 distinct N subtypes, although H1, H2, and H3 and N1 and N2 are prominently associated with disease outbreaks in humans (see: http://www.cdc.gov/ flu/about/viruses/types.htm) [Accessed 03/27/2014]. Subtypes of influenza A viruses that are prominent in one species may on occasion infect and cause disease in another. In 1998, for example, the H3N2 subtype crossed from humans to pigs, causing serious disease in the swine population. In addition, influenza A viruses from birds can be transmitted to humans directly or indirectly by an intermediate host. In this way the eight genetic elements of influenza A virus may reassort to form a new subtype (H \u00c3 N \u00c3 ) against which humans are not immune (Schweiger et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2013) . In this situation a worldwide pandemic can occur. Documented instances of avian influenza viruses infecting humans are numerous. The H5N1 designate emerged in southern China in 1997 continues to cause human infections, but causes the highest incidence of infectivity in domestic poultry and wild birds (Webster et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2013) . Infection with a novel H7N9 subtype has received recent attention and in addition to infecting domestic and wild birds has also been shown to infect ferrets and pigs (Gao et al., 2013; Uyeki and Cox, 2013; Zhu et al., 2013) .",

During the second week of infection complementfixing and hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies are present and can be readily detected.

Chemoprophylaxis for pregnant women and compromised patients can be accomplished with amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, or oseltamivir (Hayden, 2001; Schmidt, 2004) . Antipyretics and analgesics are typically used for the symptomatic relief of fever and myalgia. At present there are four drugs for treatment: oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), rimantadine (Flumadine) and Amatadine (Symmetrel). Both rimantadine and amantadine are only active and useful for influenza A. However, the CDC has advised against the use of these drugs due to the development of resistance. The neuraminidase inhibitors (see above) oseltamivir and zanamivir are active against both type A and B influenza. Unfortunately, oseltamivir, zanamivir and amantadine need to be administered within 48 h of infection and resistance to both oseltamivir and amantadine have been documented (see: http:// wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/16/1/09-1304_article.htm).

It was approved in 1966 for chemoprophylaxis and in 1976 for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza type A virus in both adults and children ! 1 year of age. Amantadine may cause central nervous system side effects (13%), including anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, light headedness, and concentration difficulty, and gastrointestinal side effects (1-3%), including nausea and anorexia, at dosages of 200 mg per day. Because its effects on pregnant women and their fetuses are unknown, it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risks. Drug resistance develops in approximately one-third of patients, with cross resistance to rimantadine. Maximum blood levels are attained within 4 h of administration of a single 100 mg dose. The peak excretion rate of amantadine is 5 mg h \u00c01 , and the mean half-life of the excretion rate is approximately 15 h. Clearance of amantadine is reduced 2-3-fold in adults with renal insufficiency. In otherwise healthy elderly adults (!65 years) the renal clearance is reduced and plasma levels therefore increased. The drug, like rimantidine, influences viral uptake by preventing membrane fusion and affects maturation of the hemagglutinin (H) to lower the infectivity of progeny virus. It is 70-90% effective in preventing illness in healthy adults and, if administered for prophylaxis within 2 days of illness, can reduce flu symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness by 1 or 2 days Rimantadine Rimantadine is effective against influenza A but not influenza B viruses. It was approved in 1993 for the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza A infections in adults and prophylaxis in children. Some consider it appropriate for the treatment of disease in children. Rimantadine may cause central nervous system side effects (6%), including anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, light headedness and concentration difficulty, and gastrointestinal side effects (1-3%) such as nausea and anorexia, at dosages of 200 mg per day. Because its effects on pregnant women and their fetuses are unknown, it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risks. Drug resistance develops in approximately one-third of patients, with cross resistance to amantadine. Rimantadine is 70-90% effective in preventing illness in healthy adults and, if administered for prophylaxis within 2 days of illness, can reduce flu symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness by 1-2 days Zanamivir",
