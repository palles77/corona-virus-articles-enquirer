            "text": "This work is concerned with the transmissibility of a disease, on observation of an outbreak of limited size. When such an outbreak occurs, an accurate estimate of the transmissibility of the responsible pathogen is essential for an appropriate response to future outbreaks. Transmissibility is usually characterised in terms of the reproduction number, R , which is the mean number of new cases of infection produced by a single infectious individual. A subcritical reproduction number ( R < 1) guarantees that an outbreak will eventually die out of its own accord. By contrast, a supercritical reproduction number ( R > 1) does not guarantee spread of the disease, since even with appreciable transmissibility, an outbreak may become extinct due to stochastic effects associated with a small number of infected individuals. Once the number of infectious individuals is conditioned on extinction, we show that an exact symmetry of the underlying theory ensures two distinct values of R , one larger than unity, the other smaller than unity, for which all outbreak properties are identical, with no signature of difference. Therefore a disease with a subcritical R , or its supercritical counterpart, when conditioned on extinction, have, for a given outbreak, identical individual likelihoods. In the full likelihood, this symmetry is lost, since the individual likelihood for a subcritical R is weighted by an extinction probability of unity, but the individual likelihood of a supercritical R is weighted by a sub-unity extinction probability. However, the inference can still benefit from the underlying symmetry, since it yields a mapping of all supercritical reproduction numbers onto the subcritical domain ( R < 1), thereby speeding up evaluation of the likelihood profile. The symmetry holds in the standard situation, where the distribution of secondary cases is Poisson, as well as where this distribution has a negative binomial form and super-spreading can occur.",

Typically, characterisation is achieved by estimating either the basic reproduction number R 0 , which applies in a large population that is fully susceptible, or the instantaneous reproduction number R t , which applies at time t after start of an outbreak, and which accounts for past exposure and any interventions which have mitigated the spread of the pathogen. Such estimates of transmissibility have been used to assess the level of intervention required to control an outbreak. For instance, if R 0 > 1 and vaccination is possible, then treating a proportion of the population that exceeds 1-1/ R 0 will bring an outbreak under control ( Fine et al., 2011 ) . Furthermore, the reproduction number (either R t or R 0 ) has multiple uses including: (i) forecasting future incidence of a pathogen , (ii) monitoring the impact of newly implemented control strategies ( International Ebola Response Team, 2016 ) , and (iii) predicting current and future attack rates ( Ferguson et al., 2016 ) .",

            "text": "While the collapsing of supercritical dynamics conditioned on extinction onto subcritical dynamics has been known ( Guttorp and Perlman, 2015; Kendall, 1956; Waugh, 1958 ) , it is clearly underexploited, or has not been appreciated in the literature of infectious disease dynamics. As highlighted by Nishiura et al. (2012 ) , studies of minor outbreaks typically adopt ' the key assumption that a subcritical process ( i.e. R 0 < 1) resulted in the observation ' ( Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013a , b ; Cauchemez et al., 2013; Ferguson et al., 2004; Kucharski and Edmunds, 2015 ) . However, we show the likelihood of a supercritical process can also be explored, therefore we see no reason to restrict any such analyses to subcritical process assumptions. We provide a simple way to explore the full range of reproduction number values (i.e. beyond the subcritical range) using likelihood framework. Such framework is easily applicable and has already been in part implemented in an R package (see http://github.com/reconhub/branchr) and used in a recent publication .",

While public health and clinical interventions ( Cori et al., 2013 ) , as well as behaviour ( Funk et al., 2009 ) , can affect the reproduction number during an outbreak, we believe that it is reasonable to assume a constant reproduction number when the outbreaks are of limited durations and sizes. As well as there often being limited available time to intervene, for many diseases (including emerging zoonotic diseases), we have limited knowledge of how to curb transmission, which is further complicated by availability and access to treatment. Additionally, when interventions have been implemented, one could view the estimated reproduction number as an effective reproduction number, see e.g., Blumberg et al. (2015 ) . In practical terms, once again, our conclusions best applies in the context of relatively small outbreaks of short duration, where the conditioning on extinction is realistic. For large outbreaks, it is likely that other factors such local depletion of the susceptible population or the implementation of public health interventions, played a stronger role in the extinction process than stochasticity by reducing the reproduction number.",

The symmetrical property of the dynamics emerging for either a small R or a large R conditioned on extinction may appear initially counter-intuitive. However, a simple intuition may come from the following: when R is small, large outbreaks are unlikely to occur, while when R is large, large outbreaks are unlikely to remain finite, therefore after conditioning on extinction, only small outbreaks will be observed. The occurrence of extinction when R is larger than unity must not be under-estimated. For instance, perhaps slightly counterintuitively, when a disease reappears, a full-blown outbreak is more likely to occur following a small extinct outbreak rather than following a moderately large one, assuming the same transmissibility applies to the new and extinct outbreaks. However, as the size of an outbreak becomes larger, there is a shift in the impact of stochastic factors toward deterministic behaviour: moderately large (ultimately extinct) outbreaks reflect an R close to unity, but given extinction occurred despite a relatively large outbreak size, stochastic factors have a decreased influence, leading to higher confidence that R lies below 1. Conversely, a small outbreak may reflect a small R , but the large uncertainty means a large R cannot be ruled out.",
