            "text": "The purpose of this study was to detect porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) subclinically infected pigs shipped from non-case farms to slaughterhouses. Systematic sampling was conducted at two slaughterhouses. A total of 1,556 blood samples were collected from 80 case and non-case farms from pigs over 6 months old. Blood samples were centrifuged to obtain sera. Serial serum dilutions were subjected to serological examination for PEDV presence using Neutralization test (NT). The cut-off titer was set at titer of 1:2 dilution and farms with at least one positive sample in duplicate were classified as PED-positive farms. Several non-case farms (9.4%, 6/64) and 100% (16/16) of the case farms were indeed positive for PEDV. The proportion of seropositive animals from case farms was 63.7%, significantly different from that of non-case farms (4.3%, P<0.05). In both case and non-case farms, the proportion of seropositive animals in farrow-to-finish farms was significantly higher than in wean-to-finish farms (P<0.05). Seropositive animals in non-case farms were detected by NT in a sero-survey by sampling at slaughterhouses. Therefore, subclinically infected pigs should be considered prior to shipment.",

PEDV results in significant economic losses due to the high morbidity and mortality in neonatal piglets [1, 2, 10, 11, 17, 21] . There is an age-dependent resistance to pathogenic PEDV infection in pigs [15] , where 2-and 7-day-old pigs inoculated with PEDV developed severe diarrhea and died. On the other hand, 2and 4-week-old pigs presented with mild diarrhea and survived after inoculation with PEDV. The 8-and 12-week-old pigs did not show any clinical signs, but antibody against PEDV were detected by Neutralization test (NT) and immunofluorescence assay [15] .",

In Japan, PED cases were first observed in 1982 [18] and only sporadic cases were reported between 1997 and 2006, with no cases were reported from 2007 to 2012 [9] . However, large-scale PED outbreaks occurred during 2013-2015. Over 800 infected farms were identified in 38 out of 47 prefectures, resulting in at least 40,000 mortal cases, predominantly in piglets [8, 9] . Out of these cases, over 40% were confirmed in Kyushu island which possesses the largest",

Subsequently, PEDV infections are confirmed by veterinary authorities at Prefectural Livestock Hygiene Centers using immunofluorescence assays and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect PEDV antigens and the PEDV genome, respectively. Based on examination results, farms declared as PED-positive are classified under \"case farms\" [8] . \"Non-case farms\" in Japan are defined as farms with no pigs showing PED clinical signs [8] . According to the Japanese procedure for pig transportation from farms to slaughterhouses, pigs are basically shipped by trucks that are managed by logistics companies. Even though these trucks may visit different farms on the same day, the procedure requires that trucks must ship the pigs from each farm directly to the slaughterhouse before proceeding to the next farm. Loading ramps and holding pens are not separated between farms at the slaughterhouse. To prevent possible cross-contamination between case and non-case farms, different trucks are assigned to carry pigs from different farms based on their PEDV infection status. Animals from noncase farms are shipped and slaughtered in the morning, followed by case farms in the afternoon [8] . Based on this definition, if a non-case farm has subclinical infected animals, there is a likelihood that the PEDV may spread from that premise to other non-case farms, free from PEDV, via slaughterhouse trucks. It is therefore critical to examine if farms categorized as non-case are indeed free from PEDV and that there are no subclinical infected pigs. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the presence of PEDV subclinically infected pigs shipped from non-case farms to slaughterhouses.",

Therefore, it is important to detect subclinical infected animals in non-case farms. Our findings show a significant difference between not only infectious status (case/non-case farms), but also production type (FF/WF).

A passive surveillance system is currently used in Japan to detect PED status. Our results showed that some non-case farms defined as farms with no pigs demonstrating PED-like clinical symptoms indeed contain subclinical PEDV-positive animals. These results indicate that the current passive surveillance system fails to detect subclinical PEDV infection. The actual infection status in the population can be misinterpreted when subclinical infections are present. These hidden subclinical animals are ultimately overlooked. Consequently, appropriate epidemiological analyses and effective control measures are not performed. While passive surveillance can rapidly detect symptomatic disease, the sensitivity of the surveillance system is affected by many factors, such as the presence of clinical cases, attentiveness of the animal producers, and performance of the diagnostic system [4] . It is particularly difficult to detect all cases of PEDV infections by passive surveillance as some PEDV-infected animals appear healthy [3] .",

However, the PEDV detection period by these methods is very short as it is limited to the acute phase only. After that, the virus is often eliminated and disappears from the infected animals [6] . In contrast, serosurveys-such as the NT used in the present study-can detect antibodies against PEDV long after infection and can be useful in diagnosing both recent and past infections [15, 19] . The presence of infectious animals increases the risk of transmission whereas recovered animals indicates that the farm may still harbor infectious individuals capable of transmitting the virus. However, sero-surveys are unable to differentiate between infectious and recovered NT-positive cases, as both cases are positive for specific antibodies against PEDV. NT-positive animals in this study were either infectious or completely recovered with no capacity for disseminating the virus. In addition, cytopathic effect was sometimes inhibited nonspecifically by low dilution. Diagnosis of PEDV infection using NT should be considered comprehensively in conjunction with detection of PEDV or PEDV genome. RT-PCR would be more appropriate to accurately classify cases in regard to the presence of PEDV genome. Therefore, the monitoring system should utilize sero-surveys as a screening technique to enhance detection of subclinical animals. Subsequently, non-case farms with sero-positive animals should be further examined using RT-PCR to confirm if infectious animals exist. However, the cost-effectiveness of this strategy must be further evaluated. And further research will be required to confirm the sensitivity and PED, porcine epidemic diarrhea; FF, farrow-to-finish production type; WF, wean-to-finish production type. a, b) Values with different superscript letters are significantly different from case and non-case farms (P<0.05). specificity of NT test.
