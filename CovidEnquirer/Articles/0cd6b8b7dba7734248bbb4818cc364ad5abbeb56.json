The elaboration of antibodies through the humoral immune system has been highly effective in the neutralization of many bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. The cell-mediated immune response also plays a major role in containment of infectious agents. T lymphocytes comprise a diverse set of cells, and their functional activity depends on helper T cells, which elaborate a variety of cytokines and stimulate B cells to produce antibodies and induce the formation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). CTLs recognize processed antigen on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and lyse infected cells.",

The function and specificity of these cells has provided the foundation for understanding MHC restriction and its importance in protection against viral infection. 1 , 2 Such cellular immune responses help control infectious diseases, particularly when it is difficult to generate neutralizing antibodies, as in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria, or tuberculosis. Humoral immunity is more readily induced with purified proteins or inactivated viruses together with appropriate adjuvants; gene-based vaccines appear to be particularly effective at inducing T-cell responses, both CD4 and CD8. At the same time, some gene-based vaccines can induce humoral immune responses when used with specific vectors or in specific prime-boost combinations. A variety of vectors, nonviral and viral, have been developed for these purposes ( Figure 62-1 ) , the most common of which are reviewed here.",

In contrast, gene-based vaccine vectors can stimulate both humoral and cellular immunity, thus providing greater selective pressure on infectious agents. In this chapter, the major gene-based vaccines progressing into clinical trials are summarized, together with the advantages and disadvantages of the individual vectors and their influence on different effector arms of the immune system. Although there is considerable experience with inactivated viruses and protein-based vaccines, the development of gene-based vaccine vectors is in its infancy. Their ability to induce cellular immunity, and their immunogenicity, safety, mode of antigen presentation, and other attractive features, are countered by limitations in knowledge about clinical efficacy, production methodologies, and concerns about antivector immunity ( Table 62 -2 ). Nevertheless, it is likely that these vectors will make unprecedented contributions to vaccinology in the future.",

            "text": "The possibility of vaccination with naked DNA generated excitement in the early 1990s when four independent groups simultaneously reported that plasmid gene delivery could result in in vivo antigen expression with resulting immune responses to the plasmid-encoded antigens. Stephan Johnson's laboratory used a device called the gene gun to \"shoot\" gold beads coated with a plasmid encoding human growth hormone as a gene therapy technique in mice. 3 Surprisingly, the animals seroconverted to this gene therapy. Other groups were attempting to harness the power of plasmids for vaccination purposes and presented their work in a session at the Cold Spring Harbor Vaccines meeting in the fall of 1992. The laboratories of Margaret Liu (Merck) and Harriet Robinson (University of Massachusetts) vaccinated mice intramuscularly with plasmids expressing influenza antigens and showed that antigen-specific immunity 4 , 5 could be induced. David Weiner (University of Pennsylvania) reported that plasmids containing HIV envelope or tumor antigens were capable of driving cellular and humoral immune responses in mice. 6 These novel results, combined with the simplicity and obvious manufacturing utility of DNA , spawned research into DNA vaccines for a plethora of viral, bacterial, parasitic, and cancer targets. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The DNA vaccine platform was perceived by the scientific community to be important as, conceptually, DNA has multiple advantages over traditional live attenuated, killed, peptidebased, and viral vector vaccines. 13 , 14 For example, DNA is easy to manipulate, and it combines the simplicity of synthetic chemistry or bacterial production with the power of genomics, allowing the rapid design and construction of potential vaccines, removing entirely the requirement to develop vaccines using pathogen-derived materials. Second, DNA vectors are extremely stable, reducing the need for a cold chain and increasing product shelf life. Therefore, the ease, stability, and cost effectiveness of this platform make it ideal for manufacturing vaccines for the developing world. Furthermore, DNA vectors themselves are not immunogenic, which allows repeat homologous vaccination without immune interference. Importantly, DNA vaccines combine the immune power of live replicating vaccines for induction of broad cellular and humoral immune responses with the safety and ease of manufacturing of a nonlive, nonspreading platform. 15 , 16 As DNA vaccines are nonreplicating, they eliminate the risk of attenuation reversions, spread in the subject, or unintended secondary infections in vaccinated populations. With some constraints, DNA vaccine products can be developed in repeat-use manufacturing facilities, thus providing enormous savings in product development and manufacturing. The implied safety advantage implicit in DNA vaccine technology has so far translated into the clinic, where DNA has provided an unparalleled safety profile over the past decade and a half of clinical study. 17 This safety profile allows expanded studies of this platform in development of vaccines for at-risk groups, including subjects with compromised immunity, the elderly, and persons on chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Understanding the mechanisms by which DNA vaccines induce antigen-specific immunity is of considerable importance. To put it simply, an antigen sequence of interest is optimized and inserted into a mammalian expression plasmid vector. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] For clinical use, such vectors tend to share specific features, including a high-copy-number origin of replication for production purposes, a human cytomegalovirus immediateearly (CMV-IE) promoter to drive expression in vivo, an RNA polyadenylation sequence (usually derived from bovine growth hormone or a similar sequence) to facilitate ribosome function, and a plasmid growth selection sequence such as a limited kanamycin bacterial gene or a nonantibiotic selection sequence to maintain stable expression of the plasmid of interest during production. 15, 17 The plasmid vaccine is delivered to the skin (intradermally) or muscle by one of several delivery methods. Once inside the cytoplasm of the cell, the plasmid enters the nucleus of transfected local cells (eg, myocytes, keratinocytes, or local resident antigen presenting cells [APCs]). 26-28 Inside these cells, the plasmid-encoded sequences drive host cell transcription, resulting in production of the foreign antigen in vivo. These host-synthesized antigens then become the subject of immune surveillance in the context of both MHC class I and class II molecules of the vaccinated host. There are specific differences between DNA vaccination and live infection. For DNA, antigen delivery remains local after plasmid transfection into cells, as there can be little spreading of antigen expression to other regions of the body. The plasmids themselves are not live but inert; they represent a focused antigen, epitope, or multiple antigens of the pathogen rather than the entire pathogen.",

Intramuscular (IM) injection is the most common mode of DNA vaccine delivery and has been shown to induce CD8 + T-cell responses with more limited antibody production. 7 For IM injection, it is likely that myocytes are directly transfected after vaccination. Dendritic cells transfected in muscle have also been shown to efficiently cross-present antigens to activate CTL and may play a role in activating MHC I restricted T cells after intramuscular vaccination. 27 Alternatively, APCs in the muscle can be directly transfected and express antigen via the MHC I pathway to activate CTL. 29 In contrast to IM injection, intradermal (ID) administration has been reported to result in a more robust humoral response consisting of IgG1 antibody production. 4, 30 The dermis is rich in APCs such as Langerhans and dendritic cells, which may enhance vaccine-induced immunity. ID vaccination, like IM vaccination, may result in APC transfection and antigen secretion, MHC class I presentation, or MHC class II presentation through cross-representation presentation. APCs are also constantly sampling the environment through endocytosis, resulting in the uptake of secreted antigen and expression, predominantly on MHC class II cells. Additionally, activated APCs express chemokines that may enhance immune cell trafficking of activated antigen-specific cells. Substantial work continues in this area.",

The goals of these studies were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune potency of the platform. These studies examined diverse DNA vaccines for a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic applications, including first HIV-1, 31 influenza, cancer antigens, hepatitis B, and malaria, 32-36 and others. 37 Although the initial DNA vaccine studies in humans demonstrated excellent tolerability and safety, 15,37 the immune responses they elicited were weaker than expected on the basis of preclinical data, stimulating concerns about the technology's immune potency. These concerns drove the development of the important prime-boost field, which combined the immune focus of the DNA platform with the immune expansion power of live recombinant vaccine platforms. 38 Highly attenuated live recombinant poxviruses, including NYVAC, the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), and the ALVAC canarypox-based vector, 39-43 and the important recombinant adenoviral platforms 44-46 were of great interest. Although these viral platforms induced strong antigen-specific cellular responses in preclinical models, preexisting poxvirus or adenovirus immunity has been reported to diminish the immune responses induced by immunization with the matching recombinant vaccine vector. [47] [48] [49] This limits the potency of these vectors in multiple-dose regimens. Furthermore, other issues regarding preexisting immunity are also possible and problematic. 50 As the DNA approach could induce a small but focused immune response that could be expanded by the subsequent boost with a recombinant vector encoding the same antigen as the DNA vaccine, this combination was viewed as a boon to the development of focused immune responses.",

The DNA-MVA combination was safe, and it induced cellular immune responses that provided partial protection against an irradiated-sporozoite malaria challenge in humans. DNA prime-pox-viral boosting is one preferred strategy, as well as boosting by adenoviral vectors and by recombinant protein antigens, among others. Studies by GeoVax (a biotechnology company ) in collaboration with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) showed that DNA priming followed by MVA boosting in humans can drive high levels of CD4 T-cell responses against HIV antigens and some level of antibody responses, which has moved this vaccine program forward. 59 The NIH Vaccine Research Center (VRC) reported on a phase 1 trial using a DNA prime and a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector as a boost, which demonstrated that this approach induced both cellular and humoral immune responses against HIV antigens. 49 , 60 Currently, a focused phase 2 study is evaluating this regimen of an HIV-1 DNA prime followed by a rAd5 boost for its ability to prevent infection or to reduce viral loads in study participants who become infected after vaccination. 61 A possible advantage of a heterologous prime/boost regimen is induction of responses that differ from those induced by repeated dosing of either vaccine modality. Specifically, a report by Cox and colleagues 62 showed that the cellular responses to an HIV vaccine expressing Gag, Pol, and Nef in a heterologous DNA/rAd5 regimen induced a greater Gag-specific CD4 T-cell response than that induced by the homologous rAd5/ rAd5 regimen in humans. 63 Furthermore, studies by Schneider and coworkers 64 and Robinson and colleagues 65 of heterologous DNA/poxvirus prime-boost immunization strategies found that T-cell responses generated with a heterologous DNA/poxvirus strategy produce immune responses 10 times higher than either platform given separately. 58 , 66 , 67 Taken together, these studies established that heterologous DNA prime-boost immunizations elicit immune responses of greater breadth than can be achieved by priming and boosting with the same vector. Overall, this strategy now has a central role in many vaccine efforts targeting diverse difficult pathogens.",

            "text": "DNA technology is highly malleable, which has contributed to systematically attacking basic platform questions, recently yielding a much-improved DNA vaccine immune profile. Major areas that have been addressed are plasmid construction and design, including the optimization of promoters and enhancer elements; polyadenylation; 68-78 incorporation of leader sequences; 79-85 vector design; antibiotic resistance and selection sequences; origin of replication choices for production; and efficient slimmer backbone designs deleted of extraneous DNA sequences, all of which can contribute to improved platform performance. An important consideration for increasing plasmid-driven immune potency involves sequence optimization. 18-25 Bacterial RNA is rich in AU sequences, whereas mammalian DNA is rich in GC. Therefore, the pool of tRNAs needed for translation in human cells is favored for sequences enriched in GC. Because of the redundancy in codon usage, unique transcriptional differences exist between bacteria, diverse viruses, parasites, and even host tumor antigens, which may benefit from attention to genetic design. DNA sequences can be codonoptimized to favor tRNA pools available in human cells, allowing the encoded mRNA to be more efficiently translated. Perhaps an even more important modification is RNA optimization, where changes are made to the RNA sequence that do not affect the amino acid sequence of the final vaccine antigen. For example, sequences rich in GC are more likely to form secondary structures and slow translation, lowering in vivo protein production. RNA optimization also involves removing internal cis-acting motifs such as TATA boxes, repeat sequences that can cause instability, cryptic splice sites, and unwanted ribosomal binding sites. A combination of these and other gene optimization strategies can have a dramatic positive effect on protein expression and vaccine immunogenicity. 100-102 More recent studies have examined some of these improved approaches in the clinic. For example, a study of a West Nile virus vaccine DNA using an improved promoter induced relevant antibody responses in most of the 30 trial participants. 267 This study extended the findings reported in trials of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Ebola plasmid vaccines, which resulted in positive serology induced by the vaccine, with lower T-cell responses. 103, 104 A major advantage of the DNA platform is the ability to rapidly customize the vaccine antigens with high precision to address specific vaccine design limitations. For example, the diversity in the HIV envelope sequence can reach greater than 15% within a subtype and greater than 30% between clades, and similar diversity issues plague influenza, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and malaria vaccine development, among others. Therefore, vaccination with a single viral sequence is unlikely to drive the diversity of responses necessary for cross-protection from the variety of sequences circulating in the population. Approaches to overcome these limitations combine computer predictions for immunogen design with synthetic chemistry to generate vaccine antigens that improve on nature. Important approaches include consensus antigen, ancestor gene, and center-of-tree designs; 105-108 mosaic antigens; 109-111 or epitope string approaches. 112-117 All of these approaches seek to focus the immune response induced by a synthetic gene cassette to specific epitopes or regions of a native antigen or an antigen predicted by computer analysis to be more conserved or invariant in the population. These strategies seek to maximize crossreactivity of the T-cell responses induced against divergent strains of the pathogen. Consensus antigens, mosaic antigens, and epitope strings are currently being studied in the clinic, and these studies should be highly informative.",

Accordingly, GM-CSF became a widely studied DNA molecular adjuvant that has been examined in macaques and in human clinical studies of a malaria vaccine. 129 However, in human studies, the adjuvant effect was not as clear as in the initial animal studies. It remains under investigation as part of a new delivery format in prime-boost. 128 Another cytokine gene, interleukin (IL)-12, has also received a great deal of attention as a DNA vaccine adjuvant. 120,124 IL-12 is a strong T-helper cell type 1 adjuvant that expands T-cell immunity, including CD8 + T-cell function. In mouse models, IL-12 increased CD8 + T-cell lysis of target cells 4.5 fold. 120 HIV-1 vaccination of nonhuman primates with IL-12 demonstrated increased cellular responses that corresponded with control of viremia and improved clinical outcomes after a SHIV98.6P challenge. The ability of IL-12 vector adjuvant to increase HIV-1-specific responses against an HIV-1 DNA vaccine is currently being studied in the clinic by the HVTN, where the adjuvant effect of plasmid-codelivered IL-12 with enhanced delivery appears promising. 125 Additionally, IL-2-Ig, a T-cell growth expansion factor, has shown positive results in mouse and macaque model systems and has been moved to human testing. 123 The ease and specificity of such combination adjuvant approaches in the DNA vaccine arena has generated an enormous amount of study of important cytokine genes, costimulatory molecules, chemokine genes, heat shock antigens, and other immune modulating molecules.

These compounds can have dual roles, facilitating plasmid entry into the cell as well as providing an adjuvant effect. Polyethyleneimine, aminefunctionalized polymethacrylates, cationic poly (\u03b2-amino) esters, poloxamers, and polyvinylpyrrolidone polymers are some important examples of molecules that can enhance DNA vaccine immune potency in specific systems. 93, 96 The poloxamer CRL1005 has demonstrated improved immune potency in preclinical models for simian HIV vaccines. 87, 98 In fact, Vaxfectin, a related delivery molecule, has exhibited enhancement of antibody responses to a DNA vaccine for influenza in recent clinical studies. In addition to polymers, ongoing studies have shown that liposome vehicles can improve DNA vaccine-induced immune responses. Studies in general support a greater effect on antibody responses than on improved T-cell responses.

The major limitations to clinical use of jet injection are the requirement for large amounts of DNA, and the DNA degradation from the high-pressure delivery. However, it is a relatively simple technique that has shown improved immune responses compared with needle and syringe in experimental model systems. Uniquely, the gene gun uses high pressure to deliver DNA-coated gold nanoparticles to the dermis.

Another important phase 2 study is being conducted by GeoVax through the HVTN to evaluate the efficacy of a DNA prime followed by a MVA virus boost. 59 An alternative clinical approach uses a DNA prime to develop T-cell responses as well as to prime for B-cell immunity, followed by a recombinant protein boost to generate more-potent antibody responses. Preliminary data from these studies are encouraging. An important HIV study of a stand-alone DNA product is being tested under protocol HVTN 080. This study of multiply optimized DNA plus an IL-12 adjuvant is testing a particular formulation (Pennvax) of DNA. Preliminary data from this study have shown clear induction of T-cell immunity in the absence of a viral vector boost.

With respect to animal models, the replication-defective adenovirus has been shown to elicit potent immune responses and protection against Ebola virus, administered either alone as a single injection, or in primeboost combinations. 155,156 The prime-boost approach induces a more potent and durable immunity, desirable for a preventive vaccine in routine use, whereas a single rAd vaccination induces a more rapid response that is sufficient for immediate protection (Figure 62-2) . This latter approach may be useful in containing acute outbreaks of Ebola infection and could be applicable to other pathogens. 33 In addition, both rAd5 vaccines and DNA prime/rAd5 boost combinations have been shown to confer partial protection in rhesus macaques against multiple HIV isolates, including SHIV-89.6P, 31,157 SIVmac239, 158 and SIVmac251. 159-161 Replication-defective adenovirus has also been used in a variety of additional animal models of infectious disease, including plague, anthrax, influenza, and malaria. 45 Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies with replication-defective adenoviral vectors for HIV-1 have been developed independently by the Merck research laboratories and the NIH VRC in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The Merck vaccine used only rAd5 vectors and encoded the Gag, Pol, and Nef genes of HIV-1. A clinical efficacy study of this product, called the STEP trial, began in 2005; it evaluated the effect of vaccineinduced T-cell responses to these gene products internal to the virus on controlling viral load. Despite the immunogenicity of this vaccine, no reduction in acquisition or long-term control of postinfection viremia was observed. 162 Further analyses revealed that persons with specific human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) types, as well as those who developed a CD8 + T-cell response to certain Gag and Nef HIV epitopes, selected against viruses that contained the vaccine epitope in vivo. 163 There was also an unexpected association between infection in vaccine recipients and those who were both uncircumcised and immune to Ad5 before vaccination.

Novel vectors based on rAd35 and rAd11 have been developed, and preclinical studies suggest that they are resistant to anti-Ad5 immunity in mice. 48, 181 The usefulness of these vectors has been compared with rAd5. Although some of the alternative vectors show less seropositivity, they are often also less immunogenic in preclinical animal studies. There also appear to be regional differences in seropositivity to diverse \"rare\" serotype rAd vectors. For example, although the rAd26 and rAd28 B serotypes have shown promise in early clinical trials and their seroprevalence is low in North America, seropositivity to these viruses approaches 80% in parts of Africa, 182,183 complicating development and regulatory issues for such vectors.",

These vectors are well tolerated and highly immunogenic at moderate doses. Whether the frequency of preexisting Ad5 immunity may compromise their usefulness in humans remains to be determined; however, a variety of strategies are under development to overcome this effect should it be found. Novel delivery vectors, as well as molecularly engineered rAd5 with development of alternative Ad serotypes from humans or other species, should provide a number of options to expand their use in the future.",

In addition, there are commensal strains such as Streptococcus gordonii, lactobacilli, and staphylococci that have been used for the induction of humoral and cellular responses. For gene-based vaccination, L. monocytogenes has been a particular focus of research. This gram-positive intracellular pathogen has been studied as a model for understanding class I MHC-restricted immune responses. These responses are normally seen against the bacterial proteins or coexpressed antigens. This microorganism uses a specialized system to introduce proteins into cells and facilitate processing and presentation through MHC class I, and different mutations have been used to develop attenuated strains that retain the ability to deliver antigens. Similarly, Salmonella bacterial strains are intracellular pathogens that become restricted to the endosomal compartment of eukaryotic cells, where they are resistant to lysis. 258 A variety of mutations have been introduced into Salmonella to generate several different live vaccine carriers, and these vaccine prototypes have undergone further development for vaccine delivery. Among the other bacterial carriers, M. bovis Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) has been a widely used bacterial vaccine; for example, this organism has been used to express HIV antigens. 259, 260 In some instances, expression of mammalian genes has required modification of codons more consistent with the host cell type, which has improved immunogenicity. At present, however, the ability of such microorganisms to induce cellular immunity is limited.",

In this instance, the aim is for the bacteria to deliver plasmid DNA into the cytoplasm of infected cells; organisms such as Shigella and Listeria have been used for this purpose. 261, 262 In addition, attenuated Salmonella has been evaluated for these purposes and has shown some promise in both infectious disease and tumor models in experimental animals. [263] [264] [265] Although the use of such bacterial vectors has been attractive in theory, it has been more difficult to reduce this method to practice. Among the concerns is the possibility of reversion or reactogenicity of these potentially pathogenic bacteria to wild type forms, the stability of the recombinant bacteria, and the possibility that preexisting immunity from exposure to natural pathogens may limit their infectivity. A variety of host genetic factors can modulate the immune response induced by the bacterial carrier, and variability in the innate immune responses to such pathogens may limit their consistency in vivo. Finally, perhaps the most challenging problem has been the ability to effect a gene transfer from bacteria into mammalian cells. It is likely that very specialized transport pathways are required for the successful implementation of this technology, and additional improvements will be necessary to improve the efficacy of this approach, which remains limited in its present form.",

Several trials using the poxvirus technology have advanced into clinical evaluation. These include canarypox, MVA, and NYVAC, which have been evaluated in various phase 1 to 3 human studies. Because the production technology for poxviruses is well known, and goodmanufacturing-practice procedures for amplification of these viruses followed protocols similar to those developed for vaccinia virus, the path into clinical studies has been relatively straightforward, as have the several trials of MVA, which has been evaluated both as a vaccine for HIV (alone and in primeboost combinations) and as a potentially safer next-generation vaccine for smallpox.",

Proof-ofconcept efficacy studies with these viruses have been performed first in animal models with either DNA or in prime-boost combinations. In such studies, impressive protection has been demonstrated. 155,266 Based on these findings, several phase 1 trials have been completed for Ebola, SARS, and West Nile virus disease targets. 103, 104, 267 In the case of influenza, both naked DNA and DNA adjuvanted with gold microparticles (by biolistics) have advanced into clinical testing. Of particular interest is the development of prime-boost strategies to stimulate the production of broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza viruses, demonstrated initially in mice, ferrets, and monkeys. 268 Phase 1 studies testing this concept in humans have revealed that even a single injection of a DNA vaccine can prime for an effective traditional vaccine boost against the H5N1 virus. This regimen also showed that more broadly neutralizing anti-stem antibodies can be elicited by vaccination in humans. 269 It is likely that licensure of a gene-based vaccine remains several years in the future. Recently, two DNA vaccines have been approved for veterinary use, including a DNA vaccine for West Nile virus in horses, developed by Fort Dodge, 270 and a DNA vaccine for infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, developed by Merieux for use in farm-raised fish. An additional vaccine is being developed against viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in farmed salmon. In these studies, a single injection of microgram amounts of DNA induces rapid and long-lasting immune protection. 271 A recombinant yellow fever vaccine has advanced into efficacy studies as well. 272 The precedent set by these studies provides hope that additional gene-based vaccines will become available for human use and may contribute to the development of protective immunity for a variety of challenging infectious diseases that have thus far eluded the grasp of vaccine-induced immunity.",
