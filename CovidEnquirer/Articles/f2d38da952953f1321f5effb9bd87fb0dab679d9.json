            "text": "In temperate climates in the northern hemisphere, the predictable yearly epidemic of colds begins in September and continues unabated until spring. This sustained epidemic curve is a result of successive waves of different respiratory viruses moving through the community ( Fig. 26.1 ). The epidemic begins with a sharp rise in the frequency of rhinovirus infections in September (after children return to school), which is followed by PIVs in October and November. RSV and HCoVs circulate during the winter months, and infection due to influenza virus peaks in the late winter. The epidemic ends with a small resurgence of rhinovirus infections in the spring. Adenovirus infection occurs at a constant rate throughout the cold season.",

A 10-year study in the 1970s of families with children who did not attend a childcare facility showed that the peak incidence of colds occurs in preschool children 1 to 5 years old, with a frequency of 7.4 to 8.3 colds per year. 5 In a 52-week longitudinal study of 108 individuals in 26 households in Utah, which included diaries of illness and testing of weekly self-collected or family-collected anterior nares specimens by FilmArray, an automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system for virus detection, respiratory symptoms were identified for 38% of person-weeks for children younger than 5 years and 20% for older children and adults. Sixty percent of respiratory illnesses were associated with virus detection, but only approximately 50% of virus detections were associated with symptoms (especially rhinovirus and bocavirus). 6 Viral transmission occurs primarily in the home setting, although the exact mechanism of spread has not been established. Colds can be spread by a small-particle (<5 \u00b5m in diameter) aerosol, which infects when 21 A yellow or white nasal discharge may result from the higher number of PMNs, whereas the enzymatic activity of PMNs (due to myeloperoxidase and other enzymes) may cause a green nasal discharge.",

            "text": "A potent chemoattractant for PMNs is produced by cells in culture infected with rhinovirus. 22 The chemoattractant has been identified as interleukin-8 (IL-8). 23 Elevated levels of IL-8 and other cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) also have been demonstrated in the nasal secretions of infected individuals. 24, 25 Elevated levels of albumin and kinins (predominantly bradykinin) in nasal secretions coincide with the onset of symptoms in experimental rhinovirus infection. 20 The elevated concentration of albumin and kinins likely results from exudation of plasma proteins due to greater vascular permeability in the nasal submucosa. The method by which viral infection initiates this vascular leak has not been determined. The release of kinins resulting from plasma exudation may augment the symptoms of the cold. Bradykinin alone can cause rhinitis and sore throat when sprayed into the noses of uninfected individuals. 26 The paranasal sinuses usually are involved during an uncomplicated cold. In one study, CT scans obtained during the acute phase of illness revealed abnormalities of one or more sinuses in 27 (87%) of 31 young adults. 27 Without antibiotic therapy, there was complete resolution or marked improvement of the sinus abnormalities in 11 (79%) of the 14 subjects for whom second CT scans were obtained 2 weeks later. In another study, MRI revealed that 60% of children with URIs had major abnormalities in their paranasal sinuses, which tended to resolve without antibiotic therapy. 28 It is not known whether sinus abnormalities result from viral infection of the sinus mucosa or from impaired sinus drainage due to viral rhinitis. Nose blowing can generate enough pressure to force fluid from the nasopharynx into the paranasal sinuses, suggesting that nose blowing may force mucus containing viruses, bacteria, and inflammatory mediators into the paranasal sinuses during a cold. 29 The middle ear can be involved during uncomplicated colds. Studies have shown that two thirds of school-aged children develop abnormal middle ear pressures within 2 weeks after the onset of a cold. 30 Otitis media was not diagnosed during the study because ears were not examined, and none of the children sought medical care. It is not known whether the abnormal middle ear pressures result from viral infection of the mucosa of the middle ear and eustachian tube or from viral nasopharyngitis with secondary eustachian tube dysfunction.",

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of preschool children with URIs showed that treatment with an antihistamine-decongestant combination (i.e., brompheniramine maleate and phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride) produced no improvement in cough, rhinorrhea, or nasal congestion, although a larger proportion of the treated children (47% vs. 26%) were asleep 2 hours after treatment. 35 Numerous decongestants, antitussives, and expectorants are available over the counter, but there is no evidence to support their use in children. A study of phenylephrine, a topical decongestant, for the treatment children 6 to 18 months old showed no decrease in nasal obstruction with its use during a URI. 36 In a study comparing placebo, dextromethorphan, and codeine for cough suppression in children 18 months to 12 years old, cough decreased in all patients within 3 days, but there was no difference in cough reduction among the three treatment groups. 37 Guaifenesin, an expectorant, has not been shown to change the volume or quality of sputum or the frequency of cough in young adults with colds. 38 Echinacea preparations, often thought to be effective in the treatment of the common cold, have no effect on the prevention or treatment of rhinovirus infection. 39 Similarly, intranasal zinc gluconate has had no effect for the treatment of colds 40 or prevention of experimental rhinovirus colds. 41 In January, 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration issued an advisory strongly recommending that over-the-counter cold and cough medications not be given to infants because of the risk of life-threatening side effects.",
