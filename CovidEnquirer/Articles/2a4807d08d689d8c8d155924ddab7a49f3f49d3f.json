Two years later, HTLV-2 was isolated from the cells of a patient with atypical hairy cell leukemia. Morphologically, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are type C viruses, which make up a group of retroviruses known as the primate T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus. Both are single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome that undergoes reverse transcription into a DNA provirus that integrates into a host T-cell genome. This integration process allows the retrovirus to cause lifelong infection, evade immune clearance, and produce diseases of long latency.",

HTLV-1 infection has also been reported in central and West Africa, Melanesia, and parts of South America and the Middle East. HTLV-2, however, consists of type A, B, and C and is reported mainly in intravenous drug users and their sexual contacts. Endemic areas include the United States, Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia.

Among children, the prevalence rate of both sexes is low, about 1%, and the male-to-female ratio is 1. Starting with adolescence, however, the prevalence increases and infection rates between males and females diverge, with female rates exceeding male rates. This trend continues into adulthood, and whereas male rates plateau by the age of 40 years, female rates continue to increase and peak at about age 60 years [7] . The reason for this divergence is ascribed to the fact that although sexual transmission is bidirectional, male-to-female transmission occurs 10 times much more efficiently. For example, some studies report that after 10 years of sexual contact with an infected partner, a woman has a 61% likelihood of being infected, as opposed to only 0.4% for a man [8] . In a Japanese cohort study of 100 discordant couples practicing unprotected sexual intercourse, there were seven seroconversions during 5 years of observation.

A study of young pregnant women (<30 years old) in French Guiana demonstrated that factors such as high gravidity, a high parity, and a negative Rhesus factor were independently linked to an increased risk of HTLV-1 seropositivity [10] . It has been postulated that the increase in HTLV-1 prevalence rates in the younger than 30 age group could be the result of high levels of sexual transmission in this population. In Jamaica or French West Indies, for example, women who were HTLV-1 seropositive were slightly more likely to have had more than three lifetime sex partners, earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and a history of sexually transmitted diseases [10] [11] [12] . In many studies an increased risk of seropositivity has been seen with increasing age but also with prior miscarriages, caesarian sections, and high gravidity. These factors are known to be associated with a low socioeconomic level, and they could reflect sexual activity and a high number of lifetime sexual partners [10] .

Virus shedding occurs primarily during the third trimester of pregnancy and usually ceases in the immediate postpartum period [16, 17] . Both JC and BK virus shedding may occur, although JC virus viruria is more common [17] .",

Compared to pregnant controls, women with reactivation of the virus tended to have a monocytosis earlier in pregnancy, a lower neutrophil count, and a significant lymphopenia [7, 16] . The only detailed data concerning polyomavirus transmission comes from nonprimate studies: perinatal transmission of virus can occur in mice if the mother develops a primary infection during pregnancy. At present there is no definitive evidence that perinatal transmission of polyomavirus occurs in the setting of maternal viruria. In one study immunoglobulin M (IgM) to BK virus was detected in three of six infants whose mothers had serologic evidence of BK virus infection during pregnancy [7] .

In patients with underlying hemolytic disorders, infections lead to transient aplastic crises.

Infection is rare in infants younger than 1 year old, presumably as a result of passively acquired maternal antibodies. The virus is transmitted via direct contact, droplet nuclei, or fomites and enters through the nose or mouth; the peak period of contagion is at the onset of parotitis. The virus replicates in the epithelial cells of the upper-respiratory tract and is spread to regional lymph nodes; primary viremia follows during which the virus is seeded to parotid glands, the CNS, pancreatic tissue, and seminiferous tubules. The clinical syndrome develops after an incubation period of 16-18 days; symptoms may be nonspecific at first, soon followed by tenderness and enlargement of the parotid gland. CNS involvement is the most common extrasalivary manifestation of mumps, but clinical meningitis or encephalitis occurs in only 0.1-10% cases [8] .

VZV is a member of the Herpesviridae family and the alpha subfamily, which also includes herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and herpes B virus. Like all herpesviruses, it induces lifelong latency in the host. Initial infection with VZV leads to the clinical syndrome of chickenpox in most susceptible hosts, although infection can be subclinical, especially in young children. Primary VZV infection in adults tends to be a more severe illness than in children, and in individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity fatal outcomes can be seen. After primary infection, latent VZV can be demonstrated in the dorsal root ganglia. Prior to an outbreak of shingles, VZV reactivates in the dorsal root ganglion and travels down the sensory nerves to the skin, where it causes the characteristic painful rash of shingles. Whereas chickenpox is primarily a disease of children, shingles is primarily a disease of adults. Decreased cell-mediated immunity puts individuals at increased risk of zoster, and outbreaks may be more severe and last longer than in nonimmunocompromised individuals. VZV infections occur worldwide and affect both sexes equally. Morbidity and mortality of primary VZV infection is more severe in adults than in children. Pneumonitis, the most frequent complication of varicella infection, is 25 times more common in adults than in children and accounts for most of the fatalities ascribed to VZV infection.",

            "text": "Primary varicella infection during pregnancy is associated with more severe disease than in other immunocompetent adults. In particular, the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of varicella pneumonitis and increased mortality. Before specific antiviral therapy was available for VZV, the mortality rate of varicella pneumonia was 11.4-15% in nonpregnant adults but increased to 36-41% in pregnant women [35] . Better supportive care and specific antiviral therapy have decreased this mortality to 13-14% [36] , and more recent reports show further reductions [37] . Maternal smoking, 100 or more skin lesions, and the third trimester of pregnancy are associated with a higher risk of varicella pneumonia [38] . Because of these findings, varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) is recommended as prophylaxis for pregnant women who are VZV seronegative who have had significant exposure to chickenpox. VZIG provides passive immunization against VZV and is effective in preventing or ameliorating disease in children. It is effective if given within 72 hours of exposure and may be effective if given up to 96 hours after exposure, but once disease is established, its efficacy is questionable. A new formulation of VZIG appears to result in higher maternal antibody levels and is comparable in efficacy and safety to standard VZIG. Acyclovir may also be used to protect against VZV infection and to treat established infection. Data on outcomes from 1129 prospectively followed acyclovir-exposed pregnancies (712 involving first-trimester exposure) were reported to a voluntary registry from June 1984 through December 1997. The data fail to show an increase in the number of birth defects identified among the fetuses exposed to acyclovir when compared with those expected in the general population. In addition, no pattern of defects was seen, suggesting that maternal acyclovir use in pregnancy is safe [39] . Varicella vaccine was licensed in 1995 to prevent chickenpox. Because it is a live-virus vaccine, its use is contraindicated in pregnancy. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) had received 87 reports of inadvertent vaccination of pregnant women as of July 25, 1998 . None of these exposures resulted in characteristic features of congenital varicella syndrome in the exposed fetuses [40] . It is interesting that 19 pregnant women received varicella vaccine by mistake (instead of VZIG) after chickenpox exposure, suggesting that health care workers need to be educated to eliminate confusion between these agents.",

Babies exposed to maternal varicella in the first 28 days of life also have increased risk of severe infections. VZIG is therefore recommended for all infants exposed to maternal varicella from 7 days prior to delivery up to 28 days after birth. Infants of mothers with zoster during the perinatal period are protected by maternal antibody and are not at increased risk of serious infection. Similarly, infants born to seropositive mothers who are exposed to chickenpox in their siblings are not at increased risk of serious infection.",

Although usually asymptomatic, primary CMV infection can be characterized by a mononucleosis-like syndrome of fever, lymphadenopathy, and lymphocytosis, especially in young adults. Like all herpesviruses, CMV establishes latent infection with polymorphonuclear cells, T cells, vascular tissue, renal cells, and salivary glands, all potentially harboring the virus. Reactivation, except in the case of immunocompromised individuals, is usually asymptomatic, and although reinfections can occur, they too are usually asymptomatic. Complications in the immunocompetent host are rare but can include pneumonia, hepatitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, thrombocytopenia, and rash. Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and bone marrow and solid organ transplants are at highest risk of complications from CMV infection. In patients with AIDS, CMV infection of the retina, CNS, and gastrointestinal tract are of particular importance. CMV has multiple different potential routes of infection. It is shed asymptomatically in saliva, urine, semen, and cervicovaginal secretions. Transmission can occur during intrauterine life, during the perinatal period, through breast milk, through close personal contact, through sexual intercourse, through blood transfusions, and through organ donation.",

To date there is only one retrospective study that has attempted to answer this question. The study looked at more than 900 patients with schizophrenia born in France between 1949 and 1981, using nonschizophrenic siblings as controls, and documented that significantly more patients with schizophrenia than controls had been exposed to the virus during the fifth month of pregnancy [60] . Currently inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for routine use in women who will be in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy.
