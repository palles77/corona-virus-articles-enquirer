Twenty-six of the patients also had measles. Viruses were found in 52 of the 123 patients (43 per cent) and rotavirus occurred in 38 children (31 per cent). Enteroviruses were found in 10 patients, adenoviruses in nine and 'small round virus' in one (six patients had dual infection). Four patients died and only one of these children had viral particles in the stools. Breast milk formed part or all of the diet in 77 children (63 per cent) and virus isolation showed a similar pattern in breast fed infants and those not receiving breast milk. In 26 patients with measles only five were excreting viruses in their stools. Therefore no strong evidence was found to link the diarrhoea associated with measles in Tanzanian children to any particular virus. The pattern of virus infection causing infantile diarrhoea was similar in Dares Salaam to other parts of the world.",

In the main hospital in Dares Salaam it was the commonest reason for admission to the paediatric wards (children aged seven years and under) in 1976. In that year 2410 children were admitted with a diganosis of gastroenteritis (Kigadye, Kimboi and Kimati, 1976) and 75 of them died (3.1 per cent). This study was carried out to examine viral aetiological agents in diarrhoeal illness: bacterial diarrhoea is not included in this study. A number of patients with measles who also had diarrhoea were included in the study to see whether diarrhoea in measles was caused by a detectable viral agent. Such diarrhoea occurring in children in the tropics indicates severe measles and often these infants require parenteral fluids (Morley, 1969) .",

Reports from Africa have been less frequent and have been mostly confined to those from South Africa. The present study attempted to investigate the viruses associated with diarrhoea in Dares Salaam and, since electron microscopy was considered essential, the study was limited to the number of stools that could be sent in one consignment by air to Scotland. Examination of stools from 123 children resulted in the detection of 58 viruses of which 38 were rotaviruses. Viruses were isolated in similar patterns both in breast fed and weaned babies. Any antibody or other inhibitory substance in breast milk (Matthews, Nair, Lawrence and Tyrell, 1976) should present an immediate barrier to any organism attempting to colonise the gut. That it failed to do so in a number of cases suggests that later breast milk may be more deficient in inhibitors, antibody or otherwise, than colostrum and investigations into the content of breast milk after prolonged lactation have yet to be done; our numbers would not permit detailed analysis by age. It is also possible that in an area where protein malnutrition is common the quality of breast milk may be poorer than elsewhere. Chrystie, Totterdell and Banatvala (1978) have reported that breast-fed babies excrete fewer rotavirus particles than bottle-fed babies in symptom free infections. The amount of virus seen in the stools of our breast-fed infants appeared to vary considerably but we were unable to standardise our methods enough for any conclusions to be drawn.",

There is evidence that measles virus may be found in the cells of the gut (Fraser and Martin, 1978) but there has been little investigation into its relationship to the associated diarrhoea which occurs in children with measles in the tropics.
