The objective of this study was to identify pathogen-specific risk factors associated with epidemic respiratory disease in calves. A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 128 outbreaks (29 dairy, 58 dairy-mixed, and 41 beef) in Belgium (2016Belgium ( -2018. A semiquantitative PCR for 7 respiratory pathogens was done on a pooled nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage sample for each herd. Potential risk factors were collected by questionnaire and derived from the national cattle registration databank. Most outbreaks occurred between October and March, and single and multiple viral infections were detected in 58.6% (75/128) and 13.3% (17/128), respectively. Bovine coronavirus (BCV) was the most frequently isolated virus (38.4%), followed by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV; 29.4%) and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI-3; 8.1%). Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni were detected in 33.3, 41.2, 89.1, and 36.4% of the herds, respectively. Specific risk factors for BCV detection were detection of M. haemolytica [odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.1-7.5)], increasing herd size [OR = 1.3 (1.0-1.8) for each increase with 100 animals] and detection of BCV by antigen ELISA on feces in calves in the last year [OR = 3.6 (1.2-11.1)]. A seasonal effect was shown for bRSV only {more in winter compared with autumn [OR = 10.3 (2.8-37.5)]}. Other factors associated with bRSV were PI-3 detection [OR = 13.4 (2.1-86.0)], prevalence of calves with respiratory disease [OR = 1.02 (1.00-1.04) per 1% increase], and number of days with respiratory signs before sampling [OR = 0.99 (0.98-0.99) per day increase]. Next to its association with BCV, M. haemolytica was more frequently detected in herds with 5 to 10 animals per pen [OR = 8.0 (1.4-46.9)] compared with <5 animals, and in herds with sawdust as bedding [OR = 18.3 (1.8-191.6)]. Also, for H. somni, housing on sawdust was a risk factor [OR = 5.2 (1.2-23.0)]. Purchase of cattle [OR = 2.9 (1.0-8.0)] and housing of recently purchased animals in the same airspace [OR = 5.0 (1.5-16.5)] were risk factors for M. bovis.",

To reduce the selection pressure from antimicrobial use in the long run, better prevention and control of RTI is urgently needed (EMA/EFSA, 2017). Airway inflammation and bronchopneumonia result from a complex interplay between multiple viral and bacterial pathogens and environmental or host factors weakening defense mechanisms or stimulating pathogen spread (Griffin et al., 2010) . A long-lasting concept is that viruses are primary pathogens, paving the way for bacterial infections (Griffin et al., 2010) . Also, Mycoplasma bovis is increasingly recognized as a primary pathogen, although this remains controversial in the scientific community (Calcutt et al., 2018) . Despite the importance of BRD, most available studies on pathogen identification in live animals are limited in number of herds and pathogens studied (Autio et al., 2007; Pardon et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2018) .",

Different sampling methods are available, of which deep nasopharyngeal swabs, transtracheal washes, and nonendoscopic broncho-alveolar lavage (nBAL) have found their way into practice (Doyle et al., 2017; Timsit et al., 2017; Van Driessche et al., 2017) . Next to classic bacterial culture and susceptibility testing, PCR is increasingly popular (O'Neill et al., 2014; DGZ, 2016) . According to practitioners, the main advantage is that many different pathogens, both viruses and bacteria, are tested and that the high sensitivity makes it possible to test pooled samples, which complies well with their desire to obtain a group diagnosis (O'Neill et al., 2014) . Also, contamination of the sample does not interfere with the test result as much as with culture. Main disadvantages are the lack of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and difficulties in the interpretation of detection of opportunistic pathogens such as Pasteurellaceae (Fulton and Confer, 2012) .",

With the exception of M. bovis (Gille et al., 2018; Schibrowski et al., 2018) , hardly any studies explored pathogenspecific risk factors for detection of the pathogen itself. In bovine mastitis, identification of pathogen-groupspecific risk factors has led to targeted control and prevention, which is economically more efficient than a standard approach (Passchyn et al., 2014; Tolosa et al., 2015) . Also, for respiratory pathogens, the eliciting risk factors might be different, enabling the possibility for customized advice instead of the current general approaches, conferring multiple and often expensive changes on farm. Additionally, being able to predict the most likely pathogen (virus, M. bovis, or Pasteurellaceae) involved at the time of the first visit based on easily measurable environmental or circumstantial factors would be of great practical value to justify antimicrobial use. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to identify at the herd level pathogen-specific risk factors for respiratory viruses and bacteria involved in epidemic outbreaks of respiratory disease.",

This project aimed at developing an accessible monitoring tool for RTI in cattle, continuously available on a webpage to offer farmers and veterinarians a view on the prevalence and spread of respiratory pathogens in their surroundings. Collection and use of data were in compliance with local ethical requirements. To stimulate sample submission, the PCR analysis of the samples was at the expense of the Flemish Animal Health Service. The target population was all cattle herds from the northern part of Belgium (Flanders). The study population was conveniently selected based on willingness to participate at a firstcome, first-serve basis until the budget was completed.",

Only ill animals were sampled. The advice to sample acute cases, which were not treated with antimicrobials in the last 14 d, was given. Animal selection was left at their discretion and consisted of a combination of the following signs: fever (>39\u00b0C), nasal discharge, ocular discharge, (induced or spontaneous) cough, increased respiratory rate (>45 breaths/min), adventitious lung sounds, and depression. For each farm 5 animals needed to be sampled. This sample size was based on the limitations of PCR to be used on pooled samples. Diagnostic performance of the PCR was identical to individual samples when the pool was limited to 5 samples (in-house validation). A separate sterile nBAL catheter was used for each animal. Lung lavage fluid was collected in sterile tubes and the 5 samples were sent to the laboratory as quickly as possible. All sampling techniques have been previously approved by the local ethical committee for use in routine sampling in practice (Ghent University EC 2014 /189, EC 2016 .",

A semiquantitative real-time PCR (Screening Pack Ruminant Respiratory Pathogens, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was conducted. Seven individual PCR reactions per sample were performed, each targeting a single respiratory pathogen: bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV; N gene), bovine parainfluenzavirus type 3 (P gene), bovine coronavirus (N gene), M. bovis (target gene = polC), Histophilus somni (RpoB), Pasteurella multocida (16S), and Mannheimia haemolytica (plpE). The DNA and RNA were extracted from bronchial alveolar lavage fluid samples using the MagVet Universal Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions and using 200 \u00b5L for extraction. The real-time PCR was performed on the ABI7500 detection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following cycling conditions: 10 min incubation at 45\u00b0C, 10 min incubation at 95\u00b0C, and 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The fluorescence data were collected during the 60\u00b0C, 1 min stage. The real-time PCR used TaqMan technology (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For each pathogen target, a duplex PCR was performed using a probe labeled with the FAM dye for the target gene and a probe labeled with the VIC dye for the internal positive control. This internal positive control is a bovine housekeeping gene whose detection is used to check for PCR inhibition and the presence of host genomic DNA. The PCR detection limits for all 7 pathogen targets range from 10 to 40 copies of nucleic acid per PCR reaction. The efficiency of the PCR reactions for the 7 pathogen targets comprised between 89.3 and 108.2%. The PCR results were classified according to the manufacturer's instructions as positive if the threshold cycle (Ct) value was <38. If no Ct value was obtained, samples were considered negative.

Noninterpretable results were not included in the analysis. Risk factors for each of the 7 pathogens were identified using multivariable logistic regression. A generalized linear mixed model was used with binomial distribution and logit link function with Wald statistics for type 3 contrasts (PROC GLIMMIX). First, all predictors were tested univariably for their association with the outcome. A total of 45 predictors (Table 1) and the PCR results for the other 6 pathogens besides the outcome pathogen were considered for the analysis. Categorical predictors were regrouped if the number of observations within a group was lower than 8. All predictors with P < 0.2 were maintained for the multivariable model. Next, the multivariable model was built stepwise backward, gradually excluding nonsignificant variables. A variable was considered a confounder if it was not an intervening variable based on a causal diagram and induced changes >25% in the coefficient of another variable. For the final models, pairwise comparisons for categorical predictors were made using Bonferroni adjustments. All biologically relevant 2-way interactions of significant fixed effects were tested. Significance was set at P < 0.05 and P < 0.10 was considered a trend. Model fit was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for logistic models (Dohoo et al., 2009) . Differences in management factors between dairy, dairy-mixed, and beef herds were determined by logistic regression (PROC GLIMMIX; as described above) for binary outcomes, and linear regression (PROC MIXED) for continuous outcomes. In the linear model, maximum likelihood was used, and Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons.",

For correct interpretation of this work, some points need to be clarified to the reader first. We used PCR, which is increasingly popular and accessible, but has important drawbacks for its interpretation at the herd level (Parker et al., 2018) . For what are considered primary pathogens (viruses and M. bovis), detection at the herd level likely represents involvement in the outbreak. For opportunistic pathogens, in this case the Pasteurellaceae family, no such conclusions can be drawn, because these species can be isolated from healthy animals as well (Van Driessche et al., 2017; Timsit et al., 2018) . Also, PCR detects the smallest amount of even dead bacteria, pointing toward the importance of sample contamination by nasal passage with the nBAL technique. Therefore, in our opinion PCR results for Pasteurellaceae both at the herd and individual level can only be interpreted as presence of the pathogen in the herd/animal. We opted for the nBAL, even though deep nasopharyngeal swabs are easier to perform, because it has a higher sensitivity to detect bRSV (Kimman et al., 1986; Doyle et al., 2017) . Many participating veterinarians also requested bacteriology to obtain an antibiogram, which is more straightforward to interpret on samples from the lower respiratory tract. The sample pooling procedure we used was evidenced in a previous study to increase the detection rate of respiratory viruses (O'Neill et al., 2014) . Unfortunately, in many occasions the PCR returned noninterpretable results for some of the pathogens, reducing the power of the study. Most likely, noninterpretable results can be judged as negative, but we took the precaution not to include them in the analysis.",

Detection of P. multocida on almost every farm, makes it different to interpret its role in BRD, when using PCR for diagnosis. The study was subject to several sources of potential bias, as with many cross-sectional studies. First, using a convenience sampling holds the risk of selection bias. We could not demonstrate any significant differences in herd size between the study and target population, which is favorable in this regard. Also, working with many different veterinarians potentially having differing motivations (e.g., the attractiveness of a free analysis) holds the inherent risk that inclusion criteria were not respected to the same extent in every outbreak. We clearly targeted epidemic outbreaks using the inclusion criteria. However, in endemic BRD herds, a short-lived increase in disease prevalence can occur for various reasons (exposure to another risk factor or infection, increase in the amount of susceptible animals, and so on). Nevertheless, in this case the outbreak will also present as an epidemic according to our case definition. It is important to realize that when using more sensitive techniques such as thoracic ultrasonography, lung lesions are found in more than 40% of the calves in herds not reporting any issues with respiratory disease (van Leenen et al., 2019) . Also, at the level of the calf, PI-3 = parainfluenzavirus type 3; b = regression coefficient; OR = odds ratio. *Winter was also significantly higher than spring-summer (P < 0.01). the use of clinical criteria for BRD diagnosis holds the risk of a substantial between-observer variation (Buczinski et al., 2016) . The use of thoracic ultrasonography, currently the most accurate field diagnostic tool for pneumonia (Buczinski et al., 2014) , would have improved our study. Unfortunately not enough veterinarians have mastered the technique in the study region. Also within the questionnaire, misclassification bias for the evaluated risk factors is possible because many different persons were interviewing. We also faced information bias because in some questionnaires not every question was answered, and sometimes handwriting was not legible.",

            "text": "The study clearly shows that epidemic respiratory disease peaks in winter months and is primarily of viral origin. We found a much higher prevalence of viruses than the only other PCR study so far, available from Ireland (O'Neill et al., 2014) . Possibly, more strict case definitions and sampling earlier in the disease course in our study explains these differences. However, we still suspect an underestimation of the viral component, as viruses can only be detected for a limited number of days (Saif, 2010) , and part of the samplings were later than a week after the start of the outbreak. Also, not including bovine herpesvirus-1 and bovine viral diarrhea virus in our analysis might have contributed to an underestimation. However, Belgium has official eradication programs for both diseases and outbreaks of these viruses have become scarce. Also, not including bovine adenovirus type 3 can be considered a flaw, given the high seroconversion rates in earlier work in this region (Pardon et al., 2011) . However, the role of adenoviruses in BRD is still not clear (Caldow et al., 1988; Giusti et al., 1998) . As seen in Ireland, BCV was the most prevalent virus, followed by bRSV (O'Neill et al., 2014) . In recent years, although still under debate, a primary role of BCV in BRD is more and more recognized (Ellis, 2019) . Bovine coronavirus has been linked as a single pathogen to lethal outbreaks of respiratory disease and diarrhea in adult dairy cattle (Decaro et al., 2008; Saif, 2010) , but within the BRD complex this virus is basically still considered an initiator of secondary infections (Ellis, 2019) . The association between coronavirus and M. haemolytica in our study might be pointing in this direction, as was previously observed for H. somni as well (Workman et al., 2019) . The question remains whether BCV or other viruses are a necessary initiator for these Pasteurellaceae to cause pneumonia. Regardless, with this large prevalence of respiratory BCV in Western European countries (Ohlson et al., 2010; Pardon et al., 2011; Toftaker et al., 2016) , it deserves better control and prevention. In contrast to North America, to our knowledge no licensed respiratory coronavirus vaccines are available within the European Union, leaving only biosecurity options accessible. Indeed, biosecurity is the core of the recently initiated BCV and bRSV eradication campaign in Norway (Toftaker et al., 2018) . Larger herds were at increased risk for a BCV outbreak in our Pardon et al.: RESPIRATORY PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS (Toftaker et al., 2016) . In contrast to that study, purchase of animals was only univariably associated with BCV detection in our study. The routine use of antigen-ELISA in cases of neonatal diarrhea might be useful to identify herds at risk in time, as the pathogen is not seasonal and potentially persists on farm.",

The detection likely represents primary involvement in the outbreak, rather than persistent infection, as it was not detected more frequently on farms reporting endemic respiratory disease besides the outbreak. The M. bovisspecific risk factors identified in our model all relate to purchase activities, which are the major risk factors for this pathogen (Maunsell et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Pasteurella multocida was ubiquitous, whereas this was not the case for M. haemolytica and H. somni, each being present in approximately one-third of the herds. For H. somni, the prevalence was higher than usually detected by culture methods, likely because the bacteria require specific growth conditions and are easily overgrown (Pardon et al., 2011; Timsit et al., 2017) . For M. haemolytica, next to simultaneous BCV detection 2 interesting risk factors were identified. First, the bacteria appears to be more prevalent in herds with larger groups of calves (>5 per pen). Group housing and increased number of animals per pen are well-known risk factors for respiratory disease (Buczinski et al., 2018) , and perhaps this is related to M. haemolytica. Second, housing on sawdust appeared to be a risk factor for both the presence of M. haemolytica and H. somni. Sawdust bedding is a known risk factor for mastitis associated with Klebsiella spp. (Schukken et al., 2012) . Possibly, also the gram-negative Pasteurellaceae thrive well in this environment, facilitating spread or infection. The use of sawdust might also signify a supplemental dust challenge to the airways and wet bedding might worsen cold stress. Sawdust also clustered within dairy herds, so potential confounding by another, unmeasured factor typical for dairy herds cannot be excluded.",

In our study we could not confirm this hypothesis for any of the studied pathogens. Questioning the efficacy of the vaccines would be one option (Theurer et al., 2015) . However, a more likely explanation is that most vaccines do not prevent infection, but rather reduce shedding and clinical signs (Theurer et al., 2015) . Anyway, it does illustrate that vaccine efficacy is hard to judge based on PCR analysis. The observation that herds that vaccinated for M. haemolytica faced higher odds for H. somni is difficult to explain. Cross-protection or more H. somni instead of M. haemolytica in herds vaccinating for the latter is possible, or the association can be explained by the cross-sectional nature of the study. ",
