This excess is higher in seasons dominated by influenza virus A(H3N2) (3, 4) . Ecologic design approaches have been used to estimate deaths caused by influenza and other respiratory viruses on the basis of weekly virus surveillance data (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Because a small proportion of persons are tested for influenza virus before death (6) , the actual contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality is not well known. Other respiratory viruses are responsible for some influenza-like illnesses and related deaths (7) and have been related to deaths of unknown cause (8) . We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of detecting influenza and other respiratory viruses in recently deceased persons and of estimating the prevalence of infections in persons who died within an influenza epidemic period.",

Respiratory viruses were found in nearly half of the persons who died of natural causes in an influenza epidemic period, and 18% were confirmed for influenza virus A(H3N2), which was the same influenza virus subtype that dominated in patients during the 2016-17 season (10, 11) . The 2016-17 influenza season was characterized in Europe by an increase in deaths (2) . Other respiratory viruses were detected during the influenza circulation period and may have contributed substantially to hospitalizations and deaths (1, 5, 12) . RT-PCR seems to have high sensitivity for the detection of respiratory viruses in deceased persons, as previously shown in studies based on coronial autopsies (8, 13) .",

Respiratory viruses can trigger secondary bacterial infections or exacerbate existing chronic conditions, and these concurrent conditions usually prevail as the underlying cause of death. Half of the deaths with influenza virus detection in the postmortem test were registered as having a noncardiorespiratory cause of death, which is consistent with a previous hospital study (6) . This finding demonstrates the difficulty in estimating the deaths related to respiratory viruses by using the mortality registers. These results raise relevant implications. Only a small proportion of deceased persons whose respiratory virus was detected in the postmortem test had been hospitalized and received this diagnosis before dying; therefore, the contribution of viral infections to death may be underestimated. Deaths related to respiratory viruses could be distributed among all causes of death. Although the burden of death has been estimated by indirect approaches (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) , this study offers a complementary novel approach to assess the impact in terms of the proportion of all-cause deaths with respiratory virus detection (14) .",

Similar characteristics of participants and nonparticipants rule out selection bias.
