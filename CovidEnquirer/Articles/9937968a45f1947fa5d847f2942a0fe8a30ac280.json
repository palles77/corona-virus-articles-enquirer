            "text": "During the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, traditional intervention measures such as quarantine and border control were found to be useful in containing the outbreak. We used laboratory verified SARS case data and the detailed quarantine data in Taiwan, where over 150,000 people were quarantined during the 2003 outbreak, to formulate a mathematical model which incorporates Level A quarantine (of potentially exposed contacts of suspected SARS patients) and Level B quarantine (of travelers arriving at borders from SARS affected areas) implemented in Taiwan during the outbreak. We obtain the average case fatality ratio and the daily quarantine rate for the Taiwan outbreak. Model simulations is utilized to show that Level A quarantine prevented approximately 461 additional SARS cases and 62 additional deaths, while the effect of Level B quarantine was comparatively minor, yielding only around 5% reduction of cases and deaths. The combined impact of the two levels of quarantine had reduced the case number and deaths by almost a half. The results demonstrate how modeling can be useful in qualitative evaluation of the impact of traditional intervention measures for newly emerging infectious diseases outbreak when there is inadequate information on the characteristics and clinical features of the new disease-measures which could become particularly important with the looming threat of global flu pandemic possibly caused by a novel mutating flu strain, including that of avian variety. r",

            "text": "In order to contain the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the government in Taiwan implemented numerous measures of intervention and control (Kaydos-Daniels et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2003; Twu et al., 2003) . Prominent among which is the Level A quarantine, implemented on March 17, for all possible contacts of suspected SARS cases which eventually reached a total of 55,632 individuals quarantined, and Level B quarantine, implemented on April 28, of all travelers arriving at borders from affected areas which totaled 95,828 (see Table 1 in Hsieh et al., 2005) . Other intervention measures implemented during the outbreak include temperature monitoring, SARS fever hotline, hand washing, restricted access to all medical facilities, fever screening at designated local hospitals, as well as mandatory face mask wearing while in hospitals, public transportation, and other enclosed public places, most of which were also implemented on April 28, the day after the first SARS fatality had occurred in Taiwan. Mathematical modeling has also pinpointed the turning point of SARS infections in Taiwan to April 28 . It is generally acknowledged that intervention measures such as isolation of symptomatic cases and the quarantine of their traced contacts had been instrumental in controlling the past SARS outbreak (Chau and Yip, 2003; Diamond, 2003; Enserink, 2003; Ou et al., 2003; Pang et al., 2003) . A recent modeling study (Fraser et al., 2004) suggests that SARS, along with smallpox, is easier to control using these simple public health measures than HIV and Influenza. However, due to the current lack of evidence regarding infectivity of SARS-CoV prior to onset, quarantine for SARS did not seem to directly prevent infections during the incubation period in the traditional sense. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that quarantine served as a screening process for SARS whereby previous quarantined persons who showed onset of symptoms can be more swiftly diagnosed and sufficiently isolated once onset of symptoms occurs (Hsieh et al., 2005) .",

(Zhang et al., 2005) used a continuous-time compartmental model to study the impact of quarantine for SARS in China.

These 134 cases were identified from a subsequent TCDC-sponsored large-scale seroepidemiological follow-up study to search for previously undiscovered SARS cases (Hsieh et al., 2005) . All seropositive cases from this study were confirmed by two different serological tests to detect anti-SARS-CoV antibody once discrepancies occurred. The ongoing laboratory test results of these newly laboratory confirmed cases are updated as of November of 2004. The resulting percentages of all Level A and B quarantined persons who had been confirmed as SARS-CoV(+) cases are, respectively, 0.041% and 0.001%.

The quarantine rate q gives a measure of the efficiency, or the speed, at which a potential Level A quarantine case is actually being quarantined. Thus quarantine rate of 0.047 estimated over the time period 2/25-6/25 indicates that, on a daily basis, only one out of every 21 exposed persons who should be quarantined was actually quarantined. This reflects the need for more efficient real-time contact tracing during the outbreak in order to seek out potential infected persons for quarantine, observation, and swift diagnosis when onset of symptoms occurs. One should note, however, that the data used includes many mild cases that were not clinically diagnosed and hence their exposed contacts were not traceable. This would result in a significantly lower quarantine rate than the one computed from using clinically diagnosed SARS cases only. Hence the efficiency of contact tracing and quarantine is also dependent on correct diagnosis of symptomatic infective individuals, which could be severely lacking in the early stages of a newly emerging disease such as witnessed during the past SARS outbreak.",

In fact, 80% of the officially confirmed SARS cases in Taiwan were acquired in hospitals (Ho and Su, 2004) , but the many of them occurred prior to the patients' hospitalization as a suspected SARS case, while they were in outpatient clinics, observation rooms, and emergency rooms, sometimes for other illness, where the patients often stayed for hours and sometimes for days before being moved (Jiang et al., 2003a, b) .

However, it is intuitive that if all imported cases were effectively isolated, there would be no local outbreak. Indeed, from our result the timeliness of Level B quarantine is important, as indicated by the difference in the reduction of cases by the two quarantined imported cases. Given the controversial nature of fullscaled quarantine of international travelers, appropriate mathematical modeling is required to provide evidence-based criterion for public health authority to determine its swift implementation. The difficulty and scope involved in a successful quarantine, as quantified in Tables 3 and 4 , gives strong indication that quarantine must be combined with other intervention measures for successful and swift containment of an outbreak. The results also corroborate with previous studies of intervention measures for SARS outbreak where hospital-wide case isolation is found to be more important than quarantine (see e.g., Day et al., 2006; Gumel et al., 2004; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2003; Webb et al., 2004) . (4) The simulation results in Tables 3 and 4 highlight the effect an efficient quarantine measure could have on significantly reducing the magnitude of the outbreak. We emphasize, however, that the numbers of reduction and increase in cases and deaths shown in Tables 3 and  4 are not to be taken literally, but to be consider qualitatively as a measure of the magnitude of the effect brought on by the various hypothetical scenarios for the purpose of comparing different control measures. However, there is ample evidence that superspreading events had played a significant role in the 2003 outbreaks (Li et al., 2004; Riley et al., 2003) which was not singled out in our model. (5) Finally, the effect of public response to outbreak and behavior change to prevent infection is most difficult to quantify. Question remains as to how one can pinpoint the degree of effectiveness or the relative importance of different measures implemented. One may never know for certain how important temperature monitoring or hand washing had been to the containment of the outbreak, or what role, if any, did mandatory face mask wearing in public transportation systems play, or whether the decrease in infection rate is merely due to the psychological effect of outbreak and the subsequent behavior change by the general population to simply try to stay home and avoid contacts-especially since multiple prevention measures were co-operating at the same time in blocking all possible channels of the transmission of SARS-CoV. One thing is certain, all of these intervention measures and the subsequent in-dividual behavior changes combined to prevent the past SARS epidemic from being more catastrophic than it was, and will be our best defense when the next emerging infectious disease approaches.",

Two-stage least-squares (2SLS) and three-stage least squares (3SLS) can both provide a very useful estimation procedure for simultaneous equation. However, 2SLS is inefficient when the system of equations contains lagged dependent variables, which account for adjustments that take place over time. We can achieve a gain in efficiency by applying 3SLS. It involves applying generalized least-squares estimation to a system of equations, each of which has first been estimated using 2SLS. The 3SLS procedure, also used for the parameter estimation in the simpler linear model in , yields more efficient parameter estimates than does 2SLS because it takes into account the cross-equation correlation and hence is utilized here for parameter estimation. Furthermore, we make use of the 3SLS subroutine in SAS package to estimate the model parameters.",

Moreover, to perform hypothesis tests for our model, we assume that the error terms follow a Gaussian distribution in order to test whether each parameter is significantly different from zero. We would like to test for H 0 :b \u00bc 0 (null hypotheses) versus H 1 :b6 \u00bc0 (alternative hypotheses). Large value of t-statistic or small value of p-value leads to conclude that H 1 :b6 \u00bc0. The p-value is less than the specified level of significant a \u00bc 0.05, we could conclude H a directly. The last column of Tables 2 and 3 give the p-values for the estimations, indicating that the data are not consistent with b \u00bc 0. Note that the p-value is sometimes called the observed level of significance, with which one can conduct a test at any desired level of significance a by comparing the p-value with the specified level a.",
