            "text": "Among the most relevant elements contributing to define the One World One Health programme we find epidemics. The reason is that in recent decades, infectious diseases such as HIV/SIDA, SARS and Influenza have shown that we need new approaches and concepts in order to understand how biological emergencies and health alerts deploy new scales of action. Especially relevant has been the case of A(H1N1) influenza. This reached the status of global threat virtually from its onset, triggering an international response with a diffusion, visibility and rapidity unparalleled in previous health alerts. This article maintains that this global condition cannot be explained solely by the epidemiologic characteristics of the disease, such as mortality rate, severe cases, propagation capacity, etc. Resorting to the approach proposed by the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), this paper suggests that the action of certain sociotechnical operators was what built a heterogeneous network of ideas, concepts and materials that turned the A (H1N1) influenza into a global-scale phenomenon with unprecedented speed. Among these operators, the most important ones were: the speaking position, a discourse about threat, the protocols and guidelines that were used and, lastly, the maps that allowed a real-time monitoring of the influenza. The paper ends with the notion of panorama, as defined by Bruno Latour: a suggestion to describe the common denominator of the aforementioned operators, and a means to foresee the development of global scales for certain health alerts. The paper will conclude by proposing that this type of analysis would allow the One World One Health to understand with greater precision the dynamic of epidemics and thus make its principles of action much more specific as well as its definition of what global health should be.",

The Manhattan Principles, recognizing the link between human, domestic animal, and wildlife health, and the threat disease poses to people, their food supplies and economies, and the biodiversity essential to maintaining healthy environments and functioning ecosystems, put forward the imperious necessity of a Global Medicine e one without limits among species and one with a scope in different scales.",

Nonetheless, this global scale can be analyzed and understood from a different angle. Rather than regarding it as a biological effect, it can be described as a production, a scale that is built and requires a series of operators to elaborate it and make it effective. As some authors have pointed out, the high visibility of an epidemic is not always tied to biologic effects, as these are not noticeable, but to a retrospective historical and demographic analysis (Rosenberg, 1992; Ranger and Slack, 1992; Watts, 1997; Van Loon, 2005) .

            "text": "Thus, the examination of how an epidemic acquires this global condition is fundamental to One World One Health for various reasons. In the first place, because epidemics are not only a biological or medical problem; along with these dimensions we find other problems, such as political, discursive, and technological ones. All these dimensions are entangled in a single totality with a homogeneous logic. Secondly, all these dimensions transform the social, political, technological, and medical aspects of our daily life. That is to say, an epidemic is something more than a medical threat: it is an event that completely transforms our immediate reality. Thus One World One Health amounts to something much greater than a medical program. Its relationship with epidemics and its proposals for action make it into something that aspires to participate in the immediate constitution of our reality. This article will examine how epidemics achieve their global condition, looking beyond simply epidemiological data, and focusing on the A(H1N1) flu outbreak. It puts forward the view that the global condition of A(H1N1) influenza was not merely declared due to the medical features of the illness such as the virus's ability to mutate, its easy transmission or its death rates. Rather, we suggest that the global effect of H1N1 influenza should be sought in the activity of specific techno-social operators, which generated and brought together the necessary conditions for this global possibility. In order to prove the aforementioned hypotheses, first of all this paper will analyze the way in which medicine, and, more concretely, epidemiology, regards the global condition of an epidemic. Secondly, it will argue that the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) gives us instruments to conceptualize that condition in a different manner. Rather than tying it to the biological nature of the phenomenon, the concepts of operator and panorama allow the global scale to be defined as a production based on the articulation of a complex infrastructure, made of heterogeneous elements. Thirdly, it will describe the operators that had a specific role in the creation of an important global condition for the A(H1N1) influenza. Finally, it will resort to the notion of panorama, as proposed by Bruno Latour (2005) , to describe the global status of certain biological phenomena in contemporary society. The paper will conclude by proposing that this type of analysis would allow One World One Health to develop a broad and socio-technical way of understanding the dynamic of epidemics and their consequences.",

The same country was then affected by the first confirmed death attributed to the above-mentioned outbreak (CDC, 2009) . From this date on, the epidemic of A (H1N1) has been surrounded by a vigorous debate, which has been documented and fueled by the media (Yang et al., 2009) . The reasons for this debate are not to be found in the strictly medical or biological aspects of the outbreak. In this respect, it might be useful to recall a few facts. First of all, the influenza was classified as new not because it is a type A outbreak, or a H1N1 subtype e the well-known pandemic of influenza of 1918 was a type A/H1N1, and since the seventies this type of virus has been detected in seasonal outbreaks; it was because a different strain was found, the so-called S-OIV. This is the real novelty of this epidemic, which, to be precise, should be called A/H1N1 virus influenza and S-OIV strain (Webby and Webster, 2003; Zimmer, 2009 ). Secondly, from its onset until September 15, 2009 it has caused the deaths of 137 people in Europe, and almost 4.000 worldwide, but the number of deaths in Europe is between 40,000 and 220,000 every year. Furthermore, unlike in other outbreaks, the population most at risk is not aged between 50 and 70, but between 25 and 49.",

Similarly, on April 29, 2009, only 12 days after the first two confirmed cases, Margaret Chan, the General Director of the WHO, increased the level of pandemic alert, declaring Phase 5 and calling on WHO member states to activate the emergency plans to respond to an influenza pandemic. A month later, on June 11, 2009, the WHO raised the pandemic alert to Phase 6. This was the official declaration of the first pandemic of the 21st century caused by the A/ H1N1 S-OIV virus. From its onset, the new A influenza had entailed the emergence of an exceptional situation in our everyday life.

Its founders define this theory as a simple toolbox to explain social transformation. The main principles of this approach can be summarized in the following points. First, ANT is a collection of explanations about social reality in which the analyst looks and defines relations and not essences, fixed entities or taken-forgranted categories. Second, these explanations do not respect either the mainstream academic frontiers (sociological, psychological or historical, given the questions are mixed) or methodological frontiers. Another frontier it breaches is that of mainstream social sciences dualisms: social versus natural, molar versus micro or agency versus structure (Krarup and Blok, 2011) . Third, ANT accounts are based on conventional ethnographies, discursive analyses, interviewers, etc. Fourth, ANT talks about social reality in terms of practices. Finally, in these practices the activity of human beings is as important as the action of materiality. In fact, ANT is very well known in social sciences thanks to the role and relevance that materiality has in its explanation (Latour, 1999 (Latour, , 2005 Law, 2004; Law and Mol, 1995 , 2001 , 2002 .",

The macro is neither above nor below the interactions, but added to them as another of their connections, feeding them and feeding off them. There is no other known way to achieve changes in a relative scale. For each of the macro places, the same type of questions can be raised.

Finally, some authors have insisted on the social globalization entailed by all epidemics. That is, they have shown how an epidemic represents an ideal chance for information, objects, practices and capital to interweave in one seamless fabric (Wagner-Egger et al., 2011) . All these contributions have been relevant in order to understand epidemics in a broad sociotechnical way. In this sense, the insights provided by the ANT allow us to go into such an analysis in greater depth. Specifically, they provide the tools to describe in detail the operators, which are the starting point for building the global scale of an epidemic, and how to deal with it. In the next section we will clarify the relevance of operators in Actor-Network Theory and in our proposal for a new understanding of pandemics.",

The notion is massively present in the philosophy of Michel Serres and is called mediator in Actor-Network Theory. An operator or mediator points to the existence of an event or action that creates a relation.

At present this is made up of an extensive global network of laboratories, national influenza centers and collaborating centers, established in more than 100 countries. In addition to monitoring the evolution of the influenza virus, this system acts as a mechanism of global alert in the event of outbreaks with a pandemic potential. The virological information provided by the GISRS centers is entered into a specific system called FluNet, which processes the information and shows it by means of graphics, tables or maps, available to the public on the WHO website.

With the information collected through the surveillance system and the advice of the Emergency Committee, the Director of the WHO progressively declared the pandemic phases e established according to a scale from 1 to 6 e while the disease was spreading across the world.

The number of people affected by A(H1N1) influenza could not stand comparison with other diseases or outbreaks that did not have the same features. Therefore, a strong challenge to the criteria used by the WHO to declare a pandemic emerged. Actors from different backgrounds and points of the globe and media of different countries, medical journals and supranational organizations e like the Council of Europe e produced allegations ranging from unjustified alarm generation to alleged conflicts of interests, with some WHO advisers related to the pharmaceutical industry. Faced with these challenges, the WHO argued that its actions were not intended to benefit the pharmaceutical industry and that their declaration of a pandemic was based solely on scientific criteria, in this case, virological and epidemiological causes. Indeed, we consider that the WHO acted following expert and specialized parameters. In fact, what happens is that, as suggested by several authors (Latour, 1999; Ong and Collier, 2005) , such parameters currently include the global condition in the way they define and act upon certain phenomena.",

This is for a simple reason: our scientific knowledge and expertise is deeply linked to these panoramas, their production and management. In that vein we have confirmed two things. First, the A(H1N1) influenza was a kind of flash point that showed how many medical phenomena act in e and thanks to e the generation of panoramas and therefore are quickly installed on a global scale that articulates and stands in for local elements or practices. In fact panoramas are just that: local products.

            "text": "Our study has three important conclusions for the One World One Health programme. First, it has shown that the global condition, which an epidemic may reach, is not solely determined by biological or medical elements. Many other factors are involved, among them institutional actors, scientific representation materials and the action of laboratories and monitoring systems etc. When we refer to a phenomenon, which has a global scale, we are not describing a situation present in every corner of the planet. On the contrary, we are referring to the constitution of a heterogeneous network of entities, which has the capacity to cause generalizable and homogenized effects. For this reason the first conclusion that should be drawn by One World One Health is that epidemics are much more than health problems. Our article suggests conceptualizing epidemics as a socio-technical phenomenon, which means that the analysis should simultaneously include e in their entirety e dimensions related to medicine, politics, science, technology, public opinion, etc. In the case of A(H1N1) influenza, it has been shown how its global condition can be explained on the basis of the action and articulation of different operators that has nothing to do with the biological component of the problem. Secondly, our work has shown that these operators have given A(H1N1) its global status in a very short time, and their observation shows that they all share a common denominator: they produce panoramas. These in turn have the ability to represent and contain totality in a simple, manageable locality. As suggested by Latour (2005) , the production of panoramas has been a privilege of science, and they have articulated themselves in special spaces, such as laboratories. The A(H1N1) influenza outbreak shows that certain institutions, such as the WHO, generate and use panoramas. They produce and articulate them within their activity in order to represent certain phenomena, and they end up establishing them in our everyday life, presenting them as assumptions, or truths that are difficult to question. From this fact there immediately arises a second conclusion for the One World One Health focus; the Manhattan Principles, the studies and statistical models that support it and the general demands made on the international community may themselves operate as panoramas and articulate themselves on specific occasions with other elements to contribute to producing a global condition in certain phenomena related to health. Thus the One World One Health should be capable of reflecting on and analyzing the type of networks, which involve all the demands and materials of various sorts that are being generated. In fact, all of this can be summarized in the necessity for an internal ethical reflection that would examine the consequences of the simple existence and activities of the movement itself. That is, the One World One Health movement should start to regard itself as a new way of understanding our daily life and our relation with our planet.",

Its search for global welfare is a proposal that is social in nature and its activities are techno-scientific and governmental in nature. The analysis of all these dimensions in the future will demand a real coming together of social and medical science.",
