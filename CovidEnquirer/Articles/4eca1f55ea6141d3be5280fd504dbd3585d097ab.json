The results showed that the vicarious traumatization scores for front-line nurses including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the vicarious traumatization scores of the general public were significantly higher than those of the front-line nurses (P < 0.001); however, no statistical difference was observed compared to the scores of nonfront-line nurses (P > 0.05). Therefore, increased attention should be paid to the psychological problems of the medical staff, especially non-front-line nurses, and general public under the situation of the spread and control of COVID-19. Early strategies that aim to prevent and treat vicarious traumatization in medical staff and general public are extremely necessary.",

China has taken active and effective actions to provide medical support for aiding in the control of the rapid spread of COVID-19. From January 24, 2020 (Chinese New Year's Eve), China has sent more than 30,000 medical staff to Wuhan city and Hubei province to provide medical support. Researchers have validated that these efficient and feasible strategies and measures are timely and effective. Medical staff often has a variety of psychological problems under a high-pressure and risk anti-pandemic situation (Kang et al., 2015) . Therefore, psychological assessment and intervention in victims and rescuers, such as medical staff and volunteers, are of great importance for the control of large-scale disasters and pandemics. This notion is not only beneficial for early actions and measures for psychological intervention, but also for tremendously improving disaster and pandemic control and rapid social recovery (Liu et al., 2013) .",

The term initially referred to the phenomenon where professional psychotherapists are involuntarily affected by the bidirectional interactions of the relationship between consultation and interview due to long-term contact with patients with mental diseases. In other words, psychotherapists experienced mental symptoms similar to psychological trauma (Collins and Long, 2003) . Currently, the scope of application of vicarious traumatization is extended to a large number of cruel and destructive disasters, where the degree of damage exceeds psychological and emotional tolerance and indirectly leads to various psychological abnormalities (Mathieu, 2014) . These psychological abnormalities are derived from sympathy for survivors of a trauma, which causes serious physical and mental distress, even mental breakdown (Sinclair and Hamill, 2007) .",

The study employed licensed registered nurses who worked in hospitals and general public (non-medical staff). Front-line nurses are engaged in the process of providing care for patients with COVID-19. Owing to the fact that the investigation was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the current isolation policy calls for reduced face-to-face contact and communication and avoidance of large gatherings and activities.

This finding may be highly related to the fact that China has adopted a strict isolation policy to deal with the epidemic, thus calling on the public to reduce face-to-face contact and communication to reduce the probability of viral transmission. During this period of COVID-19 proliferation, the majority of the general public is staying at home for isolation. Thus, they gained more time to gather knowledge about the epidemic and the lives of other people, especially those of patients with COVID-19, through the internet and media (Hu et al., 2015) . The general public not only feels sympathy for patients with COVID-19 but is also concerned about the medical staff. In the issue of public health, psychological endurance is lacking. This notion suggests that during the spread and control of COVID-19, propaganda strategies should be wellorganized and effective. In addition, early intervention measures should be taken to alleviate the psychological issues faced by the general public (Kang et al., 2018) .",

This group is mainly composed of middle-level backbone members, where most of them are single children and have not given birth. Close contact with patients with COVID-19 and direct exposure to the patients' physical and psychological sufferings have been well recognized to render front-line nurses prone to suffer from vicarious traumatization; therefore, the society and psychotherapists should actively pay more attention to the psychological problems of front-line nurses (Borenstein, 2018; Taylor et al., 2016) . However, the results of the study imply that the vicarious traumatization severity of non-front-line nurses, regardless of physical or psychological responses, is more serious than that of front-line nurses. This finding suggests that non-frontline nurses are more likely to suffer from psychological problems, whereas the psychological endurance of front-line nurses is stronger. This notion may be due to the fact that front-line nurses are voluntarily selected and provided with sufficient psychological preparation. Second, the selected front-line nurses are mainly middle-level backbone staff with working experience and psychological capacity. In addition, the vicarious traumatization of front-line nurses is typically derived from sympathy for patients with COVID-19, whereas non-front-line nurses not only feel sympathy for patients with COVID-19, but also bear the worry and sympathy for front-line colleagues. Finally, the front-line nurses are more knowledgeable about the epidemic than the general public and non-front-line nurses. Therefore, a transparent announcement of epidemic information is very beneficial to social and psychological constructs and psychological intervention at a later time (Wang et al., 2006) . Collectively, the abovementioned factors may be possible reasons for the higher severity of vicarious traumatization in non-frontline nurses than in front-line nurses.",
