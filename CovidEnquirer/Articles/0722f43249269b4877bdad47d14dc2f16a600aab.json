A recent report from M\u00e9 decins Sans Fronti\u00e8 res 6 highlights not only the destruction of health care facilities and the difficulties in treating injured people, but also describes the absence of childhood immunizations in many areas, lack of pharmaceuticals including antibiotics, and the lack of access to clean water and surge in diarrhea cases. Furthermore, medical facilities and staff have been deliberately targeted; 7 the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria wrote in a report this month, ''Medical personnel and hospitals have been deliberately targeted and are treated by parties to the conflict as military objectives.'' 8, 9 The conflict is expected to reverse the recent gains seen in the falling infant mortality rate and increased childhood immunization rate. 10 Under these circumstances a surge in infectious diseases in both Syria and neighboring countries can be expected.",
