This study investigated the impacts of MERS epidemic on emergency care utilization and mortality in South Korea. Materials and Methods: A natural experimental study was conducted using healthcare utilization and mortality data of the entire Korean population. The number of monthly emergency room (ER) visits was investigated to identify changes in emergency care utilization during the MERS epidemic; these trends were also examined according to patients' demographic factors, disease severity, and region. Deaths within 7 days after visiting an ER were analyzed to evaluate the impact of the reduction in ER visits on mortality. Results: The number of ER visits during the peak of the MERS epidemic (June 2015) decreased by 33.1% compared to the average figures from June 2014 and June 2016. The decrease was observed in all age, sex, and income groups, and was more pronounced for low-acuity diseases (acute otitis media: 53.0%; upper respiratory infections: 45.2%) than for high-acuity diseases (myocardial infarctions: 14.0%; ischemic stroke: 16.6%). No substantial changes were detected for the highest-acuity diseases, with increases of 3.5% for cardiac arrest and 2.4% for hemorrhagic stroke. The number of deaths within 7 days of an ER visit did not change significantly. Conclusion: During the MERS epidemic, the number of ER visits decreased in all age, sex, and socioeconomic groups, and decreased most sharply for low-acuity diseases. Nonetheless, there was no significant change in deaths after emergency care.",

The administrative units of Korea include eight metropolitan cities and nine provinces that are divided into cities and counties. Korea implemented National Health Insurance (NHI) in 1989, covering the entire population. The Korean government runs NHI as a single insurer, compulsorily covering inpatient, outpatient, and emergency services. 14, 15 While NHI service ensures high accessibility to medical care, the gatekeeper function of primary clinics is weak, meaning that people can visit tertiary-care hospitals freely, with low out-of-pocket costs. Korea has a total of 420 registered ERs, which are open to all beneficiaries without restriction, and overcrowding of ER is a serious problem in tertiarycare hospitals. 16, 17 The National Health Information Database (NHID) from NHI Service was analyzed. 15, 18 The eligibility database (DB), healthcare utilization DB, and death information DB contained within NHID were used for this study. The eligibility DB (patients' demographic information) included age, sex, and insurance premium as an indicator of SEP. 19 The healthcare utilization DB contained insurance service fee codes and diagnostic codes. The total number of diagnostic codes was five, including one principal code, one secondary code, and three additional diagnostic codes, based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition. All healthcare use covered by NHI was included in the NHID, but cases involving traffic accidents covered by auto insurance (accounting for approximately 2.6% of total healthcare use) and cases involving foreigners not covered by the Korean NHI were excluded. 14, 18, 20 We individually linked the eligibility DB and healthcare utilization DB with the death information DB, including date of death, to investigate the mortality after ER visits.",

In Gyeonggi Province, Suwon, where the infection control hospital is located, and Pyeongtaek, where the first patient was diagnosed, were defined as high-risk areas, while Anyang and Seongnam, which are similar to Suwon and Pyongtaek in terms of population size and number of ER visits, were defined as comparison areas.",

            "text": "Patterns of medical service use in infectious disease outbreak may vary according to the characteristics of an infection, such as infectivity and lethality of the disease. Both SARS and H1N1 influenza were epidemics that caused global panic, but the pattern of healthcare utilization changed in the opposite direction. Healthcare utilization decreased in the 2003 SARS epidemic due to fear of nosocomial infection, whereas it explo- sively increased in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic due to fear of influenza itself. [2] [3] [4] 10 In the case of MERS, since the main transmission route was nosocomial transmission and the mortality rate was high, healthcare utilization decreased during the epidemic. 12, 13 This effect was dramatic in the ER rather than other departments in hospitals, as most of the nosocomial infections occurred in a crowded ER. 6 When we analyzed the monthly number of ER visits by type of ER using the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) data, the number of ER visits decreased in all three types of ER (regional emergency medical center, local emergency medical center, and local emergency medical institution) in MERS epidemic, regardless of the type of ER. 16 Since only 186 patients were diagnosed with MERS during the epidemic in Korea, the explanation for the impact of MERS on ER use was fear, not the MERS disease itself. The effects of fear impacted everyone in the society regardless of age, sex, and SEP groups. 7 The greater reduction in the epidemic areas than in other comparison areas also corroborates the explanation that the fear of MERS infection caused the reduced utilization of healthcare. As in previous studies examining changes in healthcare utilization according to disease severity, the results of this study showed that the reduction in emergency care utilization was most prominent for low-acuity diseases. 1, 12, 13 The reduction in visits for high-acuity diseases was relatively small, and the most severe diseases did not show a decrease even in June 2015, when the epidemic was at its peak. Patients decide to use medical care based on their consideration of risks and benefits. During an infectious disease epidemic, patients use medical care when they feel that the benefits of healthcare utilization are greater than the risk of infection. 1 When there were concerns about nosocomial infections, those with low-acuity diseases, which are considered to have little benefits from emergency service use, were less likely to visit the ER. In Korea, due to the absence of limitations on healthcare utilization and the weak gatekeeping role of healthcare delivery system, unnecessary hospital utilization of low-acuity patients is prevalent. 28, 29 As a result, overcrowding in a tertiary-care hospital ER caused the MERS epidemic, and low-acuity patients decreased most when the risk of infection overwhelmed the benefit of emergency service use. A study of the SARS epidemic showed that restriction of non-urgent hospital utilization during the epidemic did not increase mortality and complication rates. 30 The authors of that study concluded that restriction of non-urgent visits is a safe public health strategy to control nosocomial infections and to maintain hospital surge capacity. Examining the scale of ER visits for low-acuity diseases with little benefit from service use is important, not only for preparing appropriate emergency surge capacity but also for providing evidence to redesign emergency service to decrease healthcarerelated infectious disease outbreak.",

This implies that the number of patients with serious conditions visiting the ER did not change, even though overall emergency care utilization decreased. As shown for cardiac arrest and hemorrhagic stroke in this study, the reduction in ER use for high-acuity diseases is expected to be minimal in infectious disease outbreak. When fear of an epidemic spreads and ER visits decrease, preparations for serious conditions need to be focused, and patients with severe diseases should not face barriers to emergency care use.",

            "text": "This study had some limitations. First, our analysis was based on the assumption that no meaningful changes in factors affecting ER visits, except for the MERS epidemic, occurred during the study period, which might not have been completely true. For example, the ratio of ER visits in December 2015 was relatively low compared to the ratio in other comparison months (87.3%; Supplementary Table 1 , only online). This may have been due to the influenza epidemic in December 2016, which occurred a month earlier than usual (influenza epidemic alarm was announced by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 2, 2014; January 22, 2015; January 14, 2016; and December 8, 2016). However, our analysis on the utilization by region (MERS risk area versus comparison area) corroborated our explanation. Second, the scope of this study only included patients who visited the ER. The health outcomes of those who did not use emergency services were not investigated. Although ER visits for the most severe conditions did not decrease, the reduction in emergency care utilization for MI and ischemic stroke, where acute care is important, might have led to complications other than short-term mortality. 31, 32 Supplementary Fig. 5 (only online) employing mortality data among the entire Korean population from Statistics Korea shows no apparent changes in overall mortality according to the MERS epidemic. However, further study is needed to investigate the long-term outcomes of reduced emergency care utilization. Third, ER visits due to traffic accidents, which account for a considerable proportion of injured patients, were not included in this study, as these cases were covered by auto insurance in Korea and not by the NHI. However, based on the estimates from NEDIS database in Korea, 5.1% of ER visits were covered by auto insurance. 33 Changes in the ER visits covered by auto insurance would not critically change the findings.",
