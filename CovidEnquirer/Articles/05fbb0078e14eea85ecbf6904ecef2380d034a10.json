During recent decades in which the challenges for biodiversity conservation and public health have escalated, zoos have made significant changes to address these difficulties. Zoos increasingly have four key areas of focus: education, recreation, conservation, and research. These key areas are important in addressing an interrelated global conservation (i.e. habitat and wildlife loss) and public health crisis. Zoo and public health professionals working together within a One Health framework represent a powerful alliance to address current and future conservation and public health problems around the world. For researchers, practitioners, and students, the collaboration between zoos and public health institutions offers the opportunity to both teach and operationalize this transdisciplinary approach. Using examples from our programs, we give a template for moving forward with collaborative initiatives and sustainable solutions involving partners in both zoos and public health institutions. We provide examples of cooperative programs and suggest a model for consideration in the development of further activities in this area.",

Zoological health professionals study the epidemiology, pathology, and clinical implications of infectious diseases that play an important role in the long-term survival of species and often also have direct human health consequences (e.g., zoonotic diseases and diseases associated with degraded environments). These include, among many others, Ebola virus in human and non-human primates, rabies and canine distemper in carnivores, fibropapillomatosis in sea turtles, and chytridiomycosis in amphibians [14] . Further, the animals housed at accredited zoos may serve as sentinels of disease for humans, wildlife, and domestic animals [2] . For example, based on the bird species that did or did not experience morbidity and/or mortality at the Bronx Zoo in New York, public health officials were made aware of the presence of West Nile Virus (WNV) in the western hemisphere by veterinary staff at the Zoo [15] . In fact, the public health concerns associated with the arrival of WNV in the USA led to the launch of the National Surveillance of West Nile Virus in Zoological Institutions, which later became the AZA Avian Influenza Network [16] . These programs were the start of a partnership between zoos and public health agencies to utilize zoo collection animals as part of a nationwide disease surveillance system [17] .",

Chronic non-infectious diseases globally cost US$30 trillion dollars, 48% of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2010 [19] . Also, losses attributed to mental illness will account for an additional US$16.1 trillion loss over the next 20 years [19] . By 2020, it is estimated that 7 out of 10 deaths in developed countries will be due to non-infectious diseases [18] . Accredited zoos have the potential to offer direct health benefits to visitors which may help to lower risk factors associated with chronic disease. For example, recent studies explore the direct benefits zoos offer for human health. In one study, a single zoo visit was shown to decrease blood pressure and result in approximately 6000 steps walked per visit [20] . In another study, visitors interacting with stingrays in a touch tank at a zoo felt happier, more energized, and less tense after their visit [21] . The impact that zoo visits have on human health and well-being are still poorly understood, but warrant further study. Engagement with the outdoors provides humans with psychological, emotional, spiritual and even physical benefits and it is thus imperative that we also understand how zoos impact human health [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

Also, being outside can help vision by lowering the chance of nearsightedness and improving distance vision [26] , can reduce stress levels in children [24] , aid in emotional development [29] , foster an improvement in critical thinking skills [30] , and result in a reduction in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms [31] .

Together, in the first four years, we have created opportunities for 7 Master of Public Health (MPH) students to gain realworld experience alongside Zoo staff. The MPH field placement students have researched the impacts of endocrine disruptor chemicals on human and wildlife health, and EID among camels in Kenya, as two examples. A number of these students have contributed to the growing body of One Health literature by publishing their work [12, 33, 34] . Through these projects, public health students have gained a better understanding of the conservation challenges that threaten human health and, more importantly, the actions that may be taken to help both human public health and wildlife and wild land conservation. Partnerships such as this can provide students the knowledge and tools to address the public health challenges of the 21st century in a transdisciplinary One Health approach.",
