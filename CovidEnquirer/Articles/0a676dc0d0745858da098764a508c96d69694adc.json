The influence of various parameters on the performance of the treatment process has been considered, namely the UV irradiation light intensity, the initial concentrations of iopromide and peroxydisulfate, and the initial solution pH. Iopromide degradation increased with UV light intensity and peroxydisulfate concentration, but decreased with initial pH. Under specific conditions complete removal of iopromide was achieved within 30 min, and near-complete mineralisation (loss of solution TOC) within 80 min. Degradation was believed to be caused by a combination of direct photolysis, sulphate radical attack, and, to a minor degree, direct oxidation by peroxydisulfate. Approximate values for the reaction rate constants have been determined and found to be equal to 1-2 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 s \u22121 for sulfate radicals, and 1-2 M \u22122 s \u22121 for S 2 O 8 2\u2212 . Overall compound degradation was observed to follow first-order kinetics where the rate constant decreased with initial solution pH. During the reaction, the solution pH decreased as a consequence of sulfate radical scavenging.",

One specific group of compounds, iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM), has become the focus of environmental concern due to the presence of these compounds in wastewaters and potential contamination of, and harm to, the aquatic environment. As halogenated compounds, they are the main contributors to the burden of total adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) in clinical wastewater [1] and several ICM compounds have been measured at relatively high concentrations (>1 g L \u22121 ) in many aqueous environments, including water treatment plant effluents, groundwaters, creeks, rivers, and drinking water [2] . At present, it is unclear whether ICM compounds themselves at the concentrations likely to be present pose a significant risk to human health, but iopromide has been shown recently to have estrogen activity [3] . There is also concern about the ecotoxicity of metabolite/transformation products of ICM, whose presence in environmental waters is suspected [4] .",

Peroxydisulphate (S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ion) is a strong oxidant (E \u2022 = 2.05 V) which has been used widely in the petroleum industry for the treatment of hydraulic fluids or as a reaction initiator [8] . The peroxydisulfate is normally available as a salt associated with ammonium, sodium or potassium. Potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) recently was shown to be an effective disinfectant and/or oxidant for the Norwalk virus, foot-and-mouth disease and Coronaviridae (causing severe acute respiratory syndrome-SARS) [9] . It has also been reported to be effective for degrading organics in hazardous wastewaters in acidic or basic media through direct chemical oxidation [8] , where peroxydisulfate is used as a sacrificial reagent [10] . However, since the reactions of peroxydisulfate are generally slow at normal temper- atures, the thermal or photochemical activated decomposition of S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ion to SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical has been proposed as a method of accelerating the process [11] , as summarised in the following reactions (Eqs.

The SO 4 2\u2212 is practically inert and is not considered to be a pollutant; the USEPA has listed it under the secondary drinking water standards with a maximum concentration of 250 mg/L (1.43 mM), based on aesthetic reasons [13] . Theoretically, sulfate ion can be regenerated electrolytically to peroxydisulfate for reuse in water as shown by Balazs et al. [14] . Since peroxydisulfate will start reacting exothermally only at 100 \u2022 C [15] , it is not recommended for use in conventional water purification processes. The potential use of photo-activated peroxydisulfate at ambient temperature is of interest and has been investigated as a treatment method for the endocrine disruptor chemical, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) [16] . At neutral pH, photo-activated (UV 254 ) peroxydisulfate achieved a complete degradation of 2 mM BHA within 5 min, and a complete mineralisation within 45 min.",

As expected, the rate of compound degradation increased systematically with light intensity, and an overall degradation of 90% was achieved in 30 min for both isomers under a light intensity of 6 lamps (\u22489 \u00d7 10 \u22126 Einstein L \u22121 s \u22121 ). The degradation kinetics were found to be approximately first-order (viz. ln C \u2212 ln C 0 = \u2212kt), and the first-order rate constant was linearly related to the light intensity (number of lamps), as shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that there was a noticeable difference in reactivity between the two isomers, with the reaction rate of isomer 2 significantly greater than isomer 1. The linear relationship between the rate constant and the light intensity can be explained by the effects of both direct photolysis and SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical reactions. For direct photolysis, the compound degradation rate, k P (s \u22121 ), can be shown to be directly proportional to the light intensity as follows [19] :",

The values of k SO 4 are relatively low which may reflect the recalcitrance of the iopromide molecular structure and the discriminating nature of SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical reactions, involving electron transfer, addition or hydrogen abstraction [20] . Similar values have been reported for SO 4 \u2212\u2022 reaction with acetic acid (1.4-20 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 s \u22121 ; [20] ), which is another compound generally resistant to oxidation. Previously, it was observed that under otherwise constant conditions the iopromide degradation rate was linearly related to the UV irradiation intensity (Fig. 3) . By reference to Eq.

The decrease was <8% with increasing pH for the initial pH range of 3-8, but was greater between pH 9 and 11 (22-29%) . At pH 11, the iopromide degradation rate was close to the theoretical rate for direct photolysis alone (0.038 min \u22121 ), indicating a high degree of SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical scavenging under such conditions.

In Fig. 7a , the influence of KPS concentration is shown whereby the decrease in solution pH increased systematically with KPS concentration for the initial period (0-5 min). This is consistent with the direct relationship between sulfate radical generation and KPS concentration, as represented by Eq. (9), thereby leading to increasing H + ions being generated as a consequence of aqueous SO 4 \u2212\u2022 scavenging (Eq. (10)). After the initial period, the further decrease in pH with time was relatively gradual and similar for all the KPS concentrations. It seems reasonable to speculate that in the initial reaction period (0-5 min), substantial degradation of iopromide occurs leading to intermediate products, some of which may behave as weak organic acids leading to the buffering of solution pH, both during the initial period and subsequently. Similarly, the results shown in Fig. 7b , for the same specific oxidation conditions (4 lamps, 0.126 mM iopromide, 2 mM KPS) but different initial pH values, show a reduction in solution pH with time corresponding to approximately equivalent H + production as a result of the scavenging of sulfate radicals. Although no investigation of reaction products was carried out in this study, there were clear indications that substantial quantities of reaction intermediates were formed. Changes in iopromide concentration and solution TOC (total organic carbon) can be seen in Fig. 8 , which demonstrated that there was very little loss of TOC (conversion to CO 2 -'mineralisation') in the early stages of the reactions (<10 min) where the corresponding degradation of iopromide was substantial. Continuation of the oxidation conditions beyond the point of full iopromide degradation leads to near-complete mineralisation of the reaction products (i.e. loss of solution TOC) after approximately 70-80 min. In general, little work has been reported on the degradation mechanisms of ICM compounds, but one recent study has indicated that oxidation by OH \u2022 radicals of iomeprol lead to the conversion of hydroxyl moieties on the compound side chains by hydrogen abstraction to aldehyde or ketone groups [22] ; similar products have been reported for iopromide undergoing biodegradation [23] . In contrast, Ning and Graham [6] observed in ozone reactions with ICM compounds the release of iodine during the period of compound degradation, suggesting cleavage of the iodine-carbon bond on the aromatic ring. Further work is required to investigate the degradation mechanisms for iopromide in the UV/KPS system, and the pathways arising from direct photolysis and sulphate radical reaction.",

            "text": "The aqueous degradation behaviour of iopromide, as a representative non-ionic ICM compound, in the presence of photo-activated potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) has been studied under various conditions of UV 254 light intensity, reactant concentrations, and solution pH. As iopromide has been found to be a recalcitrant environmental contaminant, the application of advanced oxidation processes to wastewaters containing ICM compounds represents the most viable method of treatment. The results of laboratory experiments with photo-activated KPS have shown that under specific conditions complete removal of iopromide was achieved within 30 min, and near-complete mineralisation within 80 min. The mechanisms of degradation are believed to involve a combination of direct photolysis, sulphate radical attack, and, to a minor degree, direct oxidation by peroxydisulfate. Approximate values for the reaction rate constants have been determined and found to be equal to 1-2 \u00d7 10 4 M \u22121 s \u22121 for sulfate radicals, and 1-2 M \u22122 s \u22121 for direct reactions with KPS (S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ). The rate constants appear to be relatively low compared to published values for sulphate radical reactions with other organic substrates, but this is believed to be due to the discriminating nature of SO 4 \u2212\u2022 radical reactions, involving electron transfer, addition or hydrogen abstraction, and the recalcitrant nature of the iopromide molecule. Overall compound degradation was observed to follow first-order kinetics where the rate constant decreased with initial solution pH. During the reaction the pH of the solution was observed to decrease with time, which was believed to be the consequence of sulfate radical scavenging.",
