            "text": "This presents a more difficult problem. Serum may be a source of a variety of microorganisms, but mycoplasmas, and viruses (including bacteriophages) are especially important. Much can be done to limit the bioburden of serum by careful collection of blood from animals known to be free from specific viral infections. Unfortunately, such a source is not always practical when large amounts of serum are required, especially for the manufacture of therapeutic proteins. The problem is exacerbated if the cells will grow only in medium containing fetal serum, which is frequently contaminated with bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) virus. This can be controlled by heating the serum or exposing it to gamma radiation. The presence of BVD virus may jeopardize production, but it does not offer a hazard to staff or the environment. A more serious problem is that posed recently by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle (Report, 1989 ). This appears to be due to the agent which causes scrapie in sheep and it passed to cattle in recycled animal feed. It is not certain if this poses a threat to human health: there is no evidence that scrapie offers an occupational health hazard to those who work with sheep or sheep products. Since the virus has only recently crossed the species barrier into cattle, it is too early to judge whether it poses a threat to humans. The official committee set up to review the potential hazard considered that the risk is very remote (Report, 1989) . There is no evidence as to whether BSE or scrapie will replicate in animal cells in culture, but experiments to test this are underway.",

Thus, tissue from the central nervous system (CNS) is the most abundant source of the agent and the injection of the agent into CNS is the most successful route of infection. By contrast, serum contains many orders of magnitude less of the agent and seems to be an unlikely hazard within a properly engineered plant operating to good manufacturing practice standards. Little is known about aerosol transmission of the agent, but control of aerosols (Chapter 11 ) is an important part of plant design and operation for other reasons. The best solution is to obtain serum from areas of the world where BSE and scrapie do not occur, i.e. New Zealand and Australia. Risks to the staff and public are remote.",

Continuous cell lines are usually heteroploid and have an unlimited life span in the laboratory. Examples are Vero cells, derived from monkey kidney, and CHO cells derived from Chinese hamster ovary.

            "text": "Cells that can be maintained in culture for long periods escape most of the problems of viral contamination once they have been established and characterized. There remains the problem of latent viruses with complete or partial integration of the viral nucleic acid into the host gene. Thus C type particles are frequently visualized in cell lines by electron microscopy and it is becoming practical to identify the specific sequences by DNA probes and to amplify them for study by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There is no evidence of hazard from the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus or C type particles that have been found in such cell banks. The viruses appear to be defective and are not produced in a highly infectious form in cultures of the cell (Onions and Jarrett, 1987). Moreover, the processing of the products -vaccines, therapeutic proteins or antibodies -is designed to free them from extraneous protein and nucleic acids. Tests for residual virus or viral nucleic acids (NA) in the purified product should be developed. Low levels of cellular DNA (of the order of 10 pg per mg of product) may be present in the final product: if the viral NA is integrated into the cellular DNA, e.g. for herpes or retroviruses then a highly sensitive PCR test may reveal it. This may indicate a false positive result because it is infectious virus that is the potential hazard rather than DNA sequences. Tests for residual infectious virus or viral NA are therefore to be preferred using permissive culture conditions. The hazard from transformed cells is hypothetical. Attempts to transfer tumorigenicity from cell lines to animals using subcellular fractions have not been successful. The cells themselves may cause tumours in susceptible hosts including man after large numbers of them have been injected into an immunologically privileged site or into immunosuppressed animals, but even under the most favourable experimental conditions non-viral subcellular components have not been found to induce tumours. A laboratory worker developed a local tumour after accidental needle stick injury with a human tumour cell line (Gugel and Sanders, 1986) . It would appear, therefore, that there can be no danger from the mass culture of cells in a well-designed and well-operated plant where aerosols and spillages to the environment are kept to a minimum. This opinion is supported after extensive consideration in a WHO group (Report, 1987) and addressed by a Working Party of the European Federation of Biotechnology (Kuenzi et a/., 1987; Frommer et al, 1989 Frommer et al, , 1991 .",
