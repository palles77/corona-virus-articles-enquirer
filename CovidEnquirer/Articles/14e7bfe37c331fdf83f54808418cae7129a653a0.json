Immunohistochemistry revealed small numbers of macrophages around necrotic foci that were positively stained for antimouse feline coronavirus. Electron microscopically, the cytoplasm of the macrophages contained viral particles, which were identified as coronavirus.

The procedures for animal care and housing were in compliance with the institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. At necropsy, a white, quail egg-sized mass in the mesentery, enlarged spleen and white foci in the lungs were found. After necropsy, tissue samples from the mesenteric mass, liver, kidneys, heart, gastrointestine, pancreas and urinary bladder were fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin for histological examination. The tissue samples were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned at 3 microns and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The sections of the mesenteric mass, lung and spleen were also stained by the Gram, Ziehl-Neelsen and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) methods. For immunohistochemical examination, the sections of the mesenteric mass were subjected to a labeled polymer method using Histofine Simple Stain Rat MAX-PO (MULTI) (Nichirei Biosciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for antimouse FCoV (MCA2194, 1:100, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK)",

Electron microscopic examination revealed that the cytoplasm of the macrophages around necrotic foci contained enveloped particles (Fig. 5 ).

One of the previous reports indicated that the average age at the time of diagnosis was 11 months and a sex predilection was not apparent 2 . Common clinical findings included anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea and large palpable intra-abdominal masses, and less frequent findings included hind limb paresis, central nervous system signs, vomiting and dyspnea 2 . Our ferret was 14 months old at necropsy and had shown anorexia and weight loss, in agreement with the disease properties. Aggregated plasma cells were also observed around some blood vessels surrounding granulomas in our ferret. However, no viral antigen was detected surrounding granulomas, and vasculitis was not observed in any other tissues examined histopathologically. Immune-mediated vasculitis seems not to be an essential feature of this disease in ferrets, although in cats affected with FIP, both the effusive and noneffusive forms, vasculitis is generally observed in some tissues 2,3 .",

Diagnosis of AD in ferrets is based on the presence of the typical clinical signs with hypergammaglobulinemia and a positive antibody titer 6 . We did not perform hematological or AD virus antibody examinations, so we cannot completely exclude AD. However, as already mentioned, no histopathological change was observed in the kidneys, the plasmacytic infiltration in the mesenteric mass was not severe and vasculitis was not observed in any other tissues. These findings in our ferret indicated almost no possibility of AD.",
