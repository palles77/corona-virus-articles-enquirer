One view, supported by Dales (1973) , stresses the absence of precise structural requirements for cell-virus interactions. The second view proposes specific cellular receptor sites in the plasma membrane of host cells which recognize one or several attachment proteins for a virus (cf. Lonberg-Holm and Philipson, 1981) . In the latter view cellular receptor sites, therefore, serve to specifically bind viruses as the first event in infection.",

The problem of artifacts in electron microscopy, rightly noted by Dales, has frequently provided the researcher with incorrect conclusions. In cell-virus interactions the most common artifact develops as a result of inadequate preservation of membranes. As pointed out by Dales, such artifacts may, for example, show a virus particle existing free in the cytoplasmic matrix, when in reality, it is enclosed by an inconspicuous membrane around a phagocytic vacuole. Again, in thin sections in the range of 500 to 1000 nm in thickness, this measure is equal to or greater than the width of many viruses. In random slices through cell-virus complexes, virus particles that are attached at the surface where invagination had occurred may appear as if they had lost morphological integrity at the site of contact and had merged with the plasma membrane.",

In this regard our understanding of bacterial receptors for bacterial viruses is more profound than that of cell receptors for animal viruses (Philipson, 1981) . The reasons for this situation are believed to be the difference in structural complexity of the two host types and the availability of mutants for bacteria but not for animal cells. The lack of virus receptor mutants among eukaryotic host cells is considered to have hampered identification of specific receptor molecules such as proteins. It is held that rapid development of methods to identify mutants in membrane components of mammalian cells, for example, would lead to progress in this area of research, and also aid in our understanding of the role of other surface proteins in the differentiation processes of mammalian and other eukaryotic cells (Philipson, 1981) .",

For both enveloped and nonenveloped animal viruses it seems likely that many cell receptor units are proteins or glycoproteins (Holmes, 1981; Boulanger and Philipson, 1981) . A few glycoproteins present in large amounts in cell membranes have been isolated and characterized. Such glycoproteins are believed to act as receptors for viruses (Hughes, 1973 (Hughes, , 1976 Hughes and Nain, 1978; Hennache and Boulanger, 1977; Marchesi and Andrews, 1971; Marchesi et al., 1976; Nakajo et al., 1979; Yamada and Olden, 1978) . Methods have been devised for the analysis of glycoproteins present in limited amounts in cell membranes. Such procedures will aid in determining whether these glycoproteins also serve a receptor role for viruses (Kulczycki et al., 1979; Lotan and Nicolson, 1979; Vitetta et al., 1977) . Crowell, Landau, and Siak (1981) analyzed the pathogenesis of picornavirus receptors. They note that a number of studies with cultured cells have revealed that receptors are present on cells which are targets for virus replication, but absent on cells which are not susceptible. The authors advise that extrapolation of such data to intact organs in vivo is justified only when the karyotypic, histologic, and physiologic characteristics of the cultured cells are similar to their in vivo counterparts. Cultures of cells which more accurately reflect in vivo conditions are needed to analyze the factors which control expression of functionally active viral receptors. Such cultures might reveal a relationship between expression and defined stages in differentiation (Goldberg and Crowell, 1971; Chairez et al., 1978) . Bramhall and Wisnieski (1981) have reviewed the nature of the envelope possessed by many viruses. Enveloped viruses are coated with a lipid matrix of varying complexity. This is present in a bilayer and is an essential constituent since in some virus systems, treatment with lipid solvents, detergents, or lipase inactivates infectivity or other essential processes such as hemagglutination (Kuwert et al., 1968) . With several groups of enveloped viruses it has been shown that the lipid composition of the virus reflects that of the plasma membrane from which the virus membrane is derived during virus assembly or other intimate processes such as budding (Klenk and Choppin, 1969; McSharry and Wagner, 1971; Renkonen et al., 1971) . Differences noted in specific virion lipids from those in the host plasma membrane may be attributed to a number of factors:",

The ligand which binds to the cellular receptor unit is presumed to be some element of the caps id protein (Bramhill and Wisnieski, 1981) . The corresponding component of an enveloped virus is normally a glycoprotein spike which projects from and is intimately associated with the envelope lipid matrix (Blough et al., 1977; Bramhall et al., 1979; Chen et al., 1971; Collins and Knight, 1978; Inuma. et al., 1971; Mountcastle et al., 1971; Mussgay et al., 1975) . The glycoprotein spikes are virus specific. Even though the structure of their carbohydrate moieties is largely determined by the host cell (Klenk and Choppin, 1970) , the amino acid sequence of the glycoproteins is specified by the genome . The number of glycoproteins differs among viruses, with one glycoprotein in rhabdovirus, two in myxoand paramyxoviruses, and as many as seven in pox virus (Scheid, 1981) . Figure 1 illustrates some of these points.",

            "text": "The spike glycoproteins of most enveloped viruses, e.g., the paramyxo glycoproteins, are anchored in the lipid bilayer of the viral membrane by a hydrophobic portion of the protein. This mode of spike attachment has been inferred not only from the arrangement of the glycoproteins on the surface of the virion, but also by their solubility properties. They can be solubilized by non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 or NP-40, and on removal of the detergent, the proteins aggregate by hydrophobic regions into rosettelike clusters (Scheid et al., 1972; Shimizu et al., 1974) . Studies with Sendai virus suggest that the glycoproteins extend through the entire depth of the lipid bilayer (Lyles, 1979) . Peplomeric glycoproteins serving as virus attachment proteins have been isolated from a number of viruses including orthomyxoviruses (Collins and Knight, 1978) , paramyxoviruses (Nagai et al., 1976; Scheid and Choppin, 1974) , rhabdoviruses (Kelley et al., 1972) , coronaviruses (Sturman et al., 1980) , alphaviruses (Helenius and Soderlund, 1973; Simons et al., 1973) , and retroviruses (Strand and August, 1976) . (Refer to Fig. lc. ) Meager and Hughes (1977) in their review on virus receptors summarize our present knowledge of the chemical nature of the components of the capsid (for nonenveloped viruses) and the envelope surface of viruses. These surface components are mainly proteins and possibly glycoproteins in nonenveloped viruses and glycoproteins and glycolipids in enveloped viruses. The virus surface, as the first component in virus attachment, is envisaged as an electrostatically charged surface, often covered with projections, composed of proteins, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, or combinations of these, arranged in a regular manner and having varying degrees of freedom of movement relative to one another. The virus surface should be regarded as being in a dynamic state rather than the static picture presented in electron micrographs. The projections are proteins and glycoproteins and are believed to be involved in the recognition between viruses and susceptible cells.",

These differences probably result from variations in the lipid composition of the host membrane at the site of virus attachment (Haywood, 1975) .

A detailed study of the penetration mechanism for SFV into BHK21 cells shows that the virus preferentially binds on microvilli and then probably migrates on the cell surface to the special structures referred to as coated pits, where epidermal growth factors and low-density lipoproteins are also bound. Subsequently, the virus is probably endocytosed, mainly in coated vesicles. The time the virus spends in the coated vesicles is short, and within minutes virus can be seen in larger uncoated vacuoles within the cytoplasm of the infected cells. These vacuoles may have arisen through fusion with coated vesicles. Some virus-containing vacuoles are ultimately transformed into secondary lysosomes. The final step of the penetration of SFV nucleoprotein containing the viral genome and the capsid protein probably occurs from the lysosome .",

In contrast to release by budding, some enveloped viruses also gain their release from host cells following lysis of the host plasma membranes. The mechanism responsible for membrane damage is obscure. Cytocidal viruses appear to cause alterations in cellular membranes and, in many cases, have profound effects on host membrane lipid composition following infection (Blair and Brennan, 1972; Collins and Roberts, 1972; Pfefferkorn and Hunter, 1973; Poste, 1970) . Many cytocidal viruses stimulate lipid metabolism in infected cells. Examples include adenoviruses (Mclntosh et al., 1971) , picornaviruses (Penman, 1965; Plagemann et al., 1970) , paramyxoviruses (Gilbert, 1963) , and pox viruses (Gaush and Younger, 1963) . Exceptions have been reported for enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. The Sindbis virus causes a decrease in phospholipid synthesis (Pfefferkorn and Hunter, 1973) . The temperature-sensitive mutants of SV40 virus inhibit phospholipid synthesis and this fact correlates with their ability to induce the release of cytoplasmic proteins from infected cells (Norkin, 1977) .",

The nucleocapsids of the NPVs exist as single rod forms or as groups of single virus particles, bundles. In each case an envelope, or in Bergold's terminology, a developmental membrane, surrounds the virus particles-the single forms and the bundles. The envelope or developmental membrane was reported by Bergold to be about 75 \u00dc thick. Proceeding from the envelope inward, a space of about 60 & and of lesser density than the envelope exists between it and an inner or intimate membrane. The inner membrane was reported to be about 40 \u00c4 thick. A layer of lesser density about 60 A thick follows, and, finally, the central, dense corelike column of the virus proper with a diameter of about 300 A. The average diameter of an enveloped nucleocapsid of the NPV of the silkworm, Bombyx mori L., was about 85 nm, and the average length was 330 nm. Cross and longitudinal sections through GV capsules revealed that there was almost exclusively one, and rarely two, virus particles in each capsule. Each GV nucleocapsid was also surrounded by a developmental and intimate membrane. The average diameter and length of an enveloped nucleocapsid within a capsule of the GV of Caeoeoia murinana Hubner, was 47 A x 260 K. For the NPVs and GVs studied by Bergold (1963) , there was no evidence of spherical or disk-shaped subunits, a central channel, or protrusions at one or either end of the nucleocapsid.",

            "text": "Subjecting inclusion bodies to weak alkali (Bergold, 1953) liberates the nucleocapsids. Alterations in morphology Jiave been noted using this procedure. In many cases the developmental membrane becomes removed from the nucleocapsid and the inner membrane can be studied. Kozlov and Alexeenko (1967) in such studies concluded that the inner membrane was composed of subunits or capsomeres. They considered the inner membrane to be double layered and more dense than the developmental membrane. Teakle (1969) noted that virus particles from alkalitreated polyhedra of the NPV of Anthela varia possessed structures resembling a claw at each end and a nipplelike structure at one end. Other investigators have also occasionally observed protrusions from one or both ends of similarly prepared virus particles (Bird, 1957; Smith, 1962; Ponsen et al., 1965; Summers and Paschke, 1970; Mazzone and McCarthy, 1981) . Among alkali-liberated nucleocapsids from polyhedra of NPVs, Harrap (1972a) observed enveloped, naked, and empty particles. He regarded the developmental membrane surrounding the nucleocapsid to be a three-layered virus envelope: an outer layer in which no detailed substructure could be resolved, a layer of hexagonally packed subunits referred to by Harrap as peplomers, 20 nm in diameter, and a flexible membrane or virus membrane composed of 4 nm subunits packed hexagonally. Moreover, Bergold's inner or intimate membrane was considered to be a capsid composed of subunits, 3 nm in diameter, arranged in a loose type of lattice. In this regard the notion of the inner membrane being a capsid has also been considered by other investigators (Hughes, 1958 (Hughes, , 1972 Kozlov and Alexeenko, 1967; Arnott and Smith, 1968) . In Harrap's observations, the capsid surrounds a core of internal component containing a central hole or channel, 10-15 nm in diameter. The less electron-dense region between the densely staining rod-shaped particle and the virus envelope seen in sectioned virus particles was believed to possibly represent condensed nucleoplasm of the virusinfected cell (Harrap, 1972b) . From his studies, Harrap concluded that the capsid construction of the NPVs must be similar.",

Positive transparencies of electron micrographs of virus particles were prepared and analyzed by optical diffraction. Beaton and Filshie concluded, in agreement with Harrap (1972a) , that the periodic lattice structure of the capsids of the two NPVs and the two GVs were indistinguishable. Each capsid was composed of stacked rings of subunits spaced 4.5 nm. They also were in agreement with Harrap (1972a) that the viral envelope was a triple-layered structure. To provide a more current terminology for baculovirus, Beaton and Filshie encouraged the use of the terms virus envelope and capsid for the older terms, developmental membrane and inner (intimate) membrane, respectively. They also pointed out that their results showing the close structural relationship of the capsids of NPVs and GVs supported Bellett's (1969) taxonomic observations on the close serological and genetic relationships between these two groups of baculoviruses.",

The routes of infection may determine the necessity of a viral envelope. From their study on the NPV of the silkworm, Kawarabata and Aratake (1978) concluded that peroral infection is largely the result of an enveloped virion, the peroral infectious unit. Infection of cells in the hemocoel was largely the result of the virion without an envelope, the hemocoelic infectious unit. In the case of in vitro observations, nonenveloped virions are reported to be highly infectious to cell cultures (Raghow and Grace, 1974; Henderson et al., 1974; Knudson and Tinsley, 1974; Dougherty et al., 1975; Knudson and Harrap, 1976) . Summers and Volkman (1976) attempted to clarify the controversy of the infectious form of the nucleocapsid. They made biophysical and morphological comparisons of the infectious virions from insect hemolymph and from cell culture medium with virions derived from inclusion bodies after alkaline treatment. They concluded that the nucleocapsids from hemolymph and cell culture media were predominantly loosely fitting enveloped single nucleocapsids. These virus forms, from two different sources, were similar with regard to morphological and biophysical characteristics, but were quite different from the enveloped virus particles derived from alkali-treated polyhedra. Peplomers, observed on the surface of enveloped nucleocapsids from hemolymph and cell culture media, were not associated with polyhedra-derived virus. This study supports earlier reports of nucleocapsids with loose-fitting envelopes derived from hemolymph (Summers, 1971 ) and from cell culture media .",

Extracting fatty acids from the inclusion bodies with acetone and then inoculating them per os into armyworm larvae did not affect the infectivity of the viruses, Extracting phospholipids from inclusion bodies with chloroformmethanol and then inoculating them per os into armyworm larvae almost completely inactivated the infectivity of the viruses.

Isoelectric focusing of enveloped virions demonstrated that the total electric charge distributed on the surface of the envelopes of nucleocapsids was negative in neutral and alkaline solutions. Although there was little difference in charges between enveloped virions from the NPV and GV, the charge was less negative in the former than in the latter.

(197 5) noted that the attachment of free enveloped virions to midgut cells was enhanced by a factor found in the capsule protein of the Hawaiian strain of a GV which was also infectious to the armyworm (Tanada and Hukhuhara, 1971; Tanada et al., 1973; Hara et al., 1976) . The synergistic factor from the GV had a molecular weight of approximately 126,000, and contained polypeptides and phospholipids (Yamamoto and Tanada, 1978a) . The phospholipid fraction appears to be essential for the enhancing activity. Yamamoto and Tanada (1978a) treated the synergistic factor with phospholipase C and with phospholipase A2 . Phospholipase C did not decompose the synergistic factor, but did destroy its capacity to enhance the NPV. In contrast, phospholipidase A2 had no effect on the synergistic factor. The investigators believe that the different reactions of the two phospholipases on the synergistic factor indicates that the hydrophilic group of the phospholipid fraction was exposed to the action of phospholipase C and was associated with the synergistic activity.",

In such occurrences virus particles lacking envelopes were seen within the cells. Particles attached to the microvilli exhibited varying degrees of contiguity with the microvilli membranes. In some observations the juncture of the envelope and plasma membrane appeared indistinct while in others the two membrane elements were more distinctly confluent (Kawanishi et al., 1972) . Single as well as bundles of nucleocapsids were encountered within microvilli at varying distances from the columnar cell body (Kawanishi and Pashke, 1970; Kawanishi et al., 1972) . The virus envelope appeared to be lost at the cell surface since the virions were observed in the microvilli without the envelope. Tanada et al. (1975) noted that virus particles also appeared to enter the cells at points other than the microvilli. Moreover, groups of single viruses from bundles appear to enter together into the cytoplasm of a microvillus. co-workers (1975, 1977) in their extensive study on invasion and replication of baculoviruses in vivo and in vitro noted that fusion of virus envelope and plasma membrane occurred as one step of the infection process. However, entry of virus particles' into in vitro cells probably occurred by phagocytosis. In this latter case, nucleocapsids were found in envelopes in vesicles and naked and in envelopes in the cytoplasm. Phagocytosis of many nucleocapsids was believed to involve lysosomes and/or microbodies. Those virus particles that reach the nuclear membrane may have gained entry by causing an inpouching and phagocytosis by the nuclear membrane in cell cultures, or through nuclear pores of cells in vivo. Virions may acquire an envelope within the nucleus but also from the nuclear membrane when exiting or from the plasma membrane at the time of release from the cell. In infected hemocytes, Kislev et al. (1969) maintain that phagocytosis is the mechanism of penetration regardless of whether the virus is introduced into the body per os or by intrahemocoelic injection. Kislev et al. conducted electron microscopic studies on hemocytes of the Egyptian cottonworm, Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) infected with an NPV. Of the four major types of hemocytes differentiated in the blood of the insect, virus formation was found to occur mainly in the plasmatocytoids, and only to a much lesser extent in the granular hemocytes and oenocytoids. Plasmatocytoids were observed phagocytosing free virus particles as well as several whole polyhedra. Virus particles originating, presumably, from the nucleus of the cell were found in cytoplasmic extensions of infected plasmatocytoids. Kislev et al. noted many protuberances of the nuclear membrane of the hemocytes but did not report the budding of viruses from the nuclei.",

Uncoating was also stated as occurring by this procedure for infected cells in vitro (Raghow and Grace, 1974; Hirumi and Hirumi, 1975) . Adams et al. (1975 Adams et al. ( , 1977 observed no peplomers on those virions which replicate in the nucleus and are occluded in polyhedra. It was uncertain whether these nucleocapsids in acquiring an envelope from the nuclear membranes had peplomers upon exit from the cells. The peplomer morphology was most evident on those nucleocapsids passing through the plasma membrane. These investigators believe that occluded virions may differ from nonoccluded virions as to the existence or timing of peplomer formation. Moreover, the peplomers may differ biochemically, perhaps being triggered upon release from the polyhedron prior to invasion of the microvilli of the gut.",

Nappi and Hammill (1975) studied the envelope acquisition of viral particles of the NPV of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispa?, Linnaeus) in host hemocytes. The most apparent pathological change was the development of numerous protrusions or buds of the nuclear membrane, many of which contained naked virus particles. The process of budding which was expressed by such protrusions involved an extension of both inner and outer lamellae of the nuclear membrane. The exact process by which viruses emerged from infected gypsy moth hemocytes was suggested as involving vesicles in cytoplasmic extensions of the hemocytes. The vesicles were formed as extensions of the nuclear envelope that had been pinched off into the cytoplasm. Enveloped nucleocapsids were observed as present in many of the vesicles. The nucleocapsids were believed to be transported within the vesicles to the periphery of the cell and released by exocytosis. During this process, the vesicular membrane, i.e., the outer lamellae of the nuclear envelope, could fuse with the plasma membrane to liberate the enveloped nucleocapsids into the hemolymph. This was believed to be one mode of transmission of the virus from cell to cell during the early stages of infection before the rupture of the nuclear membrane.",

Such structures are believed to be similar to the glycoprotein spikes of vertebrate viruses, serving the function of attaching the enveloped nucleocapsid to the cell (Adams et al., 1975 (Adams et al., , 1977 . However, the virus receptor concept also requires sites on the cell which serve to bind the virus particles. In the primary infection occurring in the larval gut, receptor elements may have been identified on host cells. On the surface of the microvillus, filaments have been observed to which virus particles are attached (Tanada et al., 1975) . Moreover, in the secondary infection occurring in cells of organs and tissues in the hemocoel, receptor sites may also have been observed. Dense materials have been noted along the inner lining of the plasma membrane which are in contact with spikes of the entering particles (Kawamoto et al., 1977) .",

The synergistic factor with an estimated molecular weight of 126,000 contains polypeptides and phospholipid (Hara et al., 1976; Yamamoto and Tanada, 1978a) . The phospholipid is intimately related to the enhancement which is abolished by the action of phospholipase C but not phospholipase A2. The different reactions of the two phosphoUpases on the synergistic factor suggested that the hydrophylic group of the phosphophipid was exposed to the action of phospholipase C and was associated with synergistic activity (Yamamoto and Tanada, 1978a) . Attachment of the NPV virus particles also appears to be enhanced by a phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, in the envelope of the nucleocapsid. Phosphatidylcholine is believed to enhance NPV infection by overcoming the negative potential of the viral envelope, thus increasing the attachment of virus to cell (Yamamoto and Tanada, 1978b) .",

T., and Omi, E. M. (1975 Ohba and Tanada (1983) reported on the enhancement of in vitro infection of an insect baculovirus by a synergistic factor (SF). The SF, derived from the Hawaiian strain of the GV of P. unipuncta, markedly enhanced infection of cells of Leueania separata by the typical NPV of P. unipuncta.At a concentration of 75 yg/ml of SF, the NPV infection was enhanced approximately 100 times over that observed when no SF was used. Moreover, the enhancement obtained under in vitro conditions was higher by 56 times that obtained under in vivo conditions. This is the first report of enhancement of insect viruses under in vitro conditions. The SF is believed to act in vivo and in vitro as an enhancer in the fusion of enveloped virions to the cell membrane.In terms of alternate pathways of infection, Granados and Lawler (1981) observed that some nucleocapsids pass directly through the cytoplasm of midgut cells and into the hemocoel as early as 1/2 hr post infection. These nucleocapsids do not replicate in the midgut. In other studies, it has been noted that while uncoating of nucleocapsids may occur at the nuclear pores, the process may also take place in the nucleoplasm (Hirumi et al., 1975; Granados, 1978; Walker et al., 1982) .
