While numerous reports have described the development of small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery systems for in-vivo applications, only a small number of siRNA-based therapies are currently under clinical development. This is essentially due to the lack of efficient and safe siRNA delivery systems for intravenous administration. However, the delivery of siRNA after local injection could represent an attractive route of administration to limit the issues of toxicity associated with systemic injection. We will describe here the different synthetic vectors which have been developed for the local delivery of siRNA in various organs.",

            "text": "The discovery of RNAi has generated much enthusiasm within the scientific community. In fact, siRNA molecules hold great promise as biological tools and novel therapeutic agents, particularly in the areas of oncology and infectious diseases. In several studies, siRNA has been shown to allow specific targeting of selected genes without the common adverse effects of less-specific drug-based therapies or the dangers of viral gene therapy. The development of efficient RNAi-based therapeutics faces some challenges, such as the design of optimized siRNA molecules and of suitable delivery systems able to deliver siRNA efficiently, safely and repeatedly for in-vivo applications. Concerning the design of optimized RNAi molecules, two strategies are usually described. The first consists of the chemical synthesis of small double-stranded RNA molecules of approximately 20 nucleotides with asymmetric 3' overhangs, which are directly taken up by the RISC complex in the cytoplasm. Conversely, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is composed of a small RNA sequence in a tight hairpin-turn structure and is loaded into a plasmid vector which ensures the expression of the shRNA in the nucleus. ShRNA is then cleaved by DICER complexes to produce small interfering siRNA which is taken up by the RISC complex. Thus, depending on the type of RNAi molecule used, specific vectors have to be developed. These must be optimized depending on the route of administration, the tissue or cell type expressing the target gene and on whether short-or longterm effects are required. To achieve efficient siRNA delivery, these systems must ; a) condense siRNA in nanoparticles, b) protect siRNA from enzymatic degradation, c) facilitate cellular internalization, d) promote endosomal escape, and e) not stimulate innate immunity. In this report, we will focus on the delivery of chemically synthesized duplex siRNA and not on plasmid-encoding shRNA. Non-viral delivery systems represent a promising method of efficient siRNA delivery. Non viral delivery systems consist usually of lipidic, polymeric and peptides molecules. We will report different strategies which have been developed to efficiently deliver siRNA by local administration, using non viral vectors, including mucosal and non mucosal applications.",

Direct application onto mucosal surfaces such as respiratory, gastro intestinal or vaginal epithelium is an attractive alternative to systemic delivery. Indeed mucosal delivery is a non-invasive method allowing drug delivery directly to target sites which are the main points of entry of numerous pathogens. The mucosal route reduces nuclease degradation, nanoparticle hepatic clearance and serum-induced aggregation, and facilitates direct contact with target cells. Nevertheless, major hurdles to efficient mucosal delivery include the presence of mucus lining all mucosal surfaces and a tight epithelial cell arrangement sweeping away potential penetrative material using apical cilia. While some reports have described efficient mucosal delivery of naked siRNA in the lung [1] , large volumes and significant amounts of siRNA were necessary to obtain a good deposition of siRNA on mucosal surfaces. Recent improvements have been made in mucosal siRNA delivery, leading to efficient inhibition of the targeted gene with a low dose of siRNA (Table I ).",

The majority of respiratory diseases, especially infectious diseases, are localized in the lower airways, thus siRNA delivery systems need to traverse the upper airways to reach their target in the alveolar surface of the lower airways. The upper airways present a highly branching structure with high mucocilliary clearance and the presence of mucus, preventing the entry of exogenous particles into the lower airways. To reach the lower airways, siRNA particles size and hydrodynamic behavior need to be optimized. The behavior of particles may be predicted by their aerodynamic diameter. Indeed, larger particles, with an aerodynamic diameter greater than 5 \u00b5m are mainly deposed in the mouth, throat or upper lung tissues and rapidly eliminated. Similarly, particles smaller than 1 \u00b5m are directly exhaled and eliminated before deposition in the alveoli. Clearance mechanisms also need to be considered carefully. In the lower airways, pulmonary macrophages ingest and degrade micro particles bigger than 260 nm, but smaller particles may escape macrophage clearance. The use of nanoparticles such as poly(lacticco-glycolic acid) (PLGA) could represent a suitable delivery method [2] .",

In this case, formulation of the siRNA is a critical step, because lyophilization or aerosolization of siRNA could affect their efficiency and deposition in the lung. As reported by Lam et al. [4] , different inhalation devices can be used, such as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) and nebulizers. MDIs, in which siRNA are dissolved or suspended in propellants, are commonly used but are not the ideal system for siRNA delivery because of the limited biostability of the siRNA formulation. DPIs present promising advantages for siRNA delivery: siRNA are inhaled as a cloud of particles allowing improved stability of siRNA formulations. An alternative to MDIs and DPIs is nebulization, which can be used for the delivery of large volumes. In all cases, it is very important to ensure the protection of the siRNA formulation. Indeed, siRNA could be damaged by the sheer force during the nebulization or drying process. Thus, formulation vectors need to protect siRNA from degradation. To date, no studies have reported on siRNA delivery by the inhalation method, due to the complexity of siRNA formulations required for inhalation [2] .",

Intratracheal administration ensures optimal efficiency of siRNA delivery with minimal drug loss, but it remains an invasive and non-physiological procedure and cannot be considered for applications in clinical trials or human use. In experimental animal studies, pulmonary delivery is often achieved by the instillation of small volumes of suspensions into the tracheae of mice by endotracheal intubation using an aerosol device such as a Penn Century Microsprayer (in the case of liquids) or a Dry Powder Insuflator which enables precise quantification of the delivered dose [5] . The traditional procedure for intratracheal administration required micro-surgery in order to insert the catheter between the tracheal rings. Recently, an alternative method has been developed that does not require an incision in the tracheal tract, but rather the catheter is inserted in the trachea via the mouth, the trachea remains intact.

RSV infects the uppers and lower respiratory tract leading to croup, pneumonia and bronchiolitis. RSV and PIV infections could, notably, be reduced by the deletion of the P protein of RSV and PIV, which may be implicated in viral replication. Thus, Bitko et al. reported lung delivery of siRNA targeting the P protein of respiratory syncitial virus or parainfluenza virus [1] . Two siRNA against RSV and one against PIV were selected for an in vivo study. Mice were administered intranasally with approximately 70 \u00b5g siRNA complexed with TransIT-KO reagent, which is a polycation/liposomal formulation from Mirus Corporation (Madison, United States). Four hours later mice were intranasally infected with RSV or PIV. Evaluation of siRNA efficacy was assessed five to six days after viral infection, when the maximum RSV replication in the lung occurs. At this time, viral titers were reduced by approximately 99 % in mice treated with RSV or PIV siRNA compared with untreated mice. Notably, naked siRNA was also able to inhibit pulmonary viral titers. Furthermore, virus inhibition was highly specific, as RSV siRNA did not inhibit PIV and vice versa, and the TransIT-KO reagent did not cause discomfort in uninfected mice. When mice were co-administered with the three siRNA at 70 \u00b5g each and co-infected with RSV and PIV, both viral titers were significantly reduced. In addition, Bitko et al. also evaluated whether siRNA delivery was associated with curative effects once infection was well established. In this case, mice administered with siRNA at the same time as, or one day after, viral infection, showed stable, or increased body weights, compared with uninfected mice. The administration of siRNA later, two to four days after viral infection, led to less-effective protection against RSV resulting in a decreased mouse body weight, with a late increase in body weight. Altogether, these results suggest that RSV siRNA delivery in the lungs enables a protective or curative effect on RSV replication.",

To assess the efficiency of siRNA delivery, mice were pretreated with 50 \u00b5g naked siRNA by intravenous injection, followed 16 to 24 h later by infection with H1N1 influenza virus. A second dose of 20 \u00b5g siRNA formulated with the lipidic carrier OligofectamineTM, at a charge ratio of 3:2, was administered intranasally. Two different siRNA against influenza virus protein NP and PA were tested, alone or in combination.

Although knowledge in the field of lung cancer research has increased, the median survival time for primarily non-curable tumors is still less than 12 months [16] . Xu et al. assessed the potency of siRNA formulated with poly(ester amine) delivery for the treatment of lung cancer [17] . Protein kinase 1 (Akt1) is one of the most-frequently hyperactivated signaling pathways in cancer, notably in lung cancer. Poly(ester-amine) is a biodegradable polymer with a high transfection efficiency and low toxicity compared with polyethyleneimine (PEI). Anti-Akt1 siRNA was formulated with the polycation poly(ester amine) at a poly(ester amine)/siRNA charge ratio of 45, and administered in a mouse model of K-rasLa1 or urethane-induced lung cancer by a nose inhalation system. Mice were exposed twice a week, for total of four weeks, to aerosol in a nose-only exposure chamber, as described by Tehrani et al. [18] . Analyses of Akt1 expression and tumor growth were performed at the end of the protocol. This in vivo study clearly demonstrated the anticancer effect of Akt1 siRNA in the lung through aerosol inhalation and showed Akt1 protein expression knockdown of about 80 % in the lung. This was sufficient to suppress pulmonary tumor progression in K-rasLA1 mice and urethane-induced lung cancer mice. Moreover, aerosol delivery of Akt1 siRNA did not affect Akt1 protein expression in other organs.",

            "text": "RNA interference is also a promising strategy to inhibit the expression of pathologically (over-)-expressed genes, notably in inflammatory pathologies such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moschos et al. investigated knockdown of p38 MAP kinase by conjugating siRNA with different non-viral delivery vectors such as cholesterol, TAT (48-60) peptide (derived from the transactivator of transcription (TAT) of human immunodeficiency virus) and penetratin peptide [19] . p38 MAP kinase is known to be implicated in the release of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-1. Inhibition of p38 MAP kinase could be a promising approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and psoriasis [20] . Intratracheal administration of approximately 15 to 750 \u00b5g siRNA conjugated either with TAT (48-60), penetratin or cholesterol in mice resulted in a 30-45 % knockdown of p38 MAP kinase expression at 6 h, as observed with naked siRNA. Nevertheless, increasing amount of siRNA did not lead to an improvement in mRNA expression knockdown, but rather to an improvement of the duration of knockdown, except when siRNA were conjugated with penetratin. TAT (48-60) peptide alone was also able to reduce p38 MAP kinase expression, suggesting that TAT (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) peptide is a modulator of p38 MAP kinase. It is interesting that TAT (48-60) peptide and cholesterol-conjugated siRNA did not elicit an innate immune response, contrary to penetratin-conjugated siRNA. This study suggests that conjugation of siRNA with CPP or cholesterol may extend, but not increase, siRNA knockdown in the lung, compared with naked siRNA. Moreover, some CPPs, such as TAT peptides, are able to suppress unintended immunostimulation by recognition with the toll-like-receptor (TLRs) that are usually observed when siRNA is internalized in the endosome. Further studies are required to characterize the mechanisms of action of CPP on gene expression and immune activation.",

The aim was to target the M cells present in Peyer's patches in the intestinal wall in order to reach macrophages where Map4k4 siRNA could modulate cytokine expression. By oral delivery of GeRPs loaded with approximately 400 ng siRNA, the authors reported the internalization of siRNA-GeRP particles in macrophages as expected, followed by a marked inhibition of Map4k4 mRNA levels of 40 % in the lung, 50 % in the spleen and 80 % in the liver, respectively, compared with controls. Moreover, the gene-silencing effects persisted for up to eight days after the last oral siRNA delivery, with no unexpected immune stimulation response. Of interest, oral delivery of GeRP particles loaded with only 400 ng siRNA lead to the efficient inhibition of mRNA expression: a dose five to 250 times less than the dosage usually used for systemic siRNA delivery [22, 23] .",

The advantages of vaginal administration are numerous: this method is non-invasive, bypasses hepatic clearance and provides local delivery directly to the target tissue, reducing the amount of therapeutic agent required for efficient gene silencing. Vaginal siRNA delivery has already been described in pre-clinical trials for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) [26] , but the method remains challenging as siRNA molecules have to cross mucosal barriers and be taken up by cervicovaginal epithelial cells, while avoiding nuclease degradation.",

            "text": "Considering this, intravaginal siRNA delivery systems need to be effective, safe and non-irritating to mucosal surfaces, as inflammation of vaginal tissues renders them more permissive to infection. The majority of the developed systems are based on liposomal carriers. Palliser et al. showed that FITC-labeled siRNA formulated with the commercial reagent Oligofectamine, and delivered intravaginally, is efficiently taken up by the vaginal and ectocervical epithelium [26] . Moreover, when siRNA-targeting EGFP were administered intravaginally with Oligofectamine to EGFP-expressing mice, GFP expression was reduced three days later and this effect persisted for at least nine days without systemic silencing in distant organs. Nevertheless, it has been reported that lipoplexes remain toxic and unstable at high ionic conditions, leading to serious concerns regarding the use of liposomal carriers to deliver siRNA to mucosal surfaces [27] [28] [29] [30] . Woodrow et al. have developed biodegradable polymer nanoparticles enabling efficient siRNA delivery in mucosal surfaces [31] . These authors reported that poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, with biodegradable and biocompatible properties, could be formulated with siRNA and delivered to the vaginal mucosa leading to efficient gene silencing. A single administration of siRNA/PLGA nanoparticles into vaginal mucosa produced effective and sustained gene silencing throughout the female reproductive tract for at least 14 days. In order to efficiently encapsulate siRNA, the authors chose to pre-encapsulate siRNA with spermidine which acts as a counterion, following which the siRNAspermidine was encapsulates in PLGA nanoparticles at a charge ratio of 8:1 (N/P ratio), with a loading efficiency of 75 ng siRNA per milligram PLGA. After topical administration to the cervicovaginal tract, PLGA nanoparticles were detected in the vaginal canal and the uterine horns. Intravaginal delivery of siRNA targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) formulated with PLGA in transgenic GFP mice led to a reduction of GFP expression by 50-60 % in the reproductive tract up to ten days post administration using approximately 2 \u00b5g siRNA. Mice receiving siRNA formulated with PLGA showed earlier inhibition of EGFP expression without histological modification of the vaginal epithelium compared with mice receiving siRNA formulated with commercial liposomes (Lipofectamine RNAiMax from Invitrogen) which showed thickened vaginal epithelium with the presence of neutrophils. Thus, PLGA nanoparticles are attractive carriers for vaginal siRNA delivery as they are able to penetrate deeply into tissues and to silence gene expression efficiently using only a single dose of siRNA.",

They developed a novel alginate scaffold system containing muco-inert PEGylated lipoplexes based on DOTAP and cholesterol lipid, which provide a sustained vaginal presence of lipoplexes and facilitate the delivery of siRNA into the vaginal epithelium [32] . These PEGylated, lipoplex-entrapped alginate scaffolds (PLAS) were fabricated using a freeze-drying method. The use of PEGylated liposomes enabled better particle stability in the mucus, and the alginate scaffold facilitated the retention of these particles in the vaginal cavity following intravaginal administration. The authors compared the efficiency of intravaginal siRNA delivery of the PLAS system with that of cationic lipoplexes. The results showed a six-fold increase in the percentage of uptake of siRNA into vaginal tissues for the PLAS system compared with cationic lipoplexes. To assess the level of siRNA knockdown, mice were treated with 8 \u00b5g lamine A/C-siRNA formulated in PLAS system per dose, and two doses were administered intravaginally to each mouse on two consecutive days. Twenty-four hours later, the knockdown of lamine A/C in vaginal tissues was of 85 % in mice receiving lamine A/C siRNA treatments compared with control mice. This study was the first to demonstrate vaginal siRNA delivery using biodegradable scaffold and liposomes. This novel system is a promising approach for vaginal siRNA delivery and its ease of administration offers vital features for rapid clinical development.",

            "text": "The vaginal mucosa is one of the main entry points for numerous viral and bacterial pathogens which cause infectious and inflammatory diseases. Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) infection causes significant morbidity and is an important cofactor in the transmission of HIV infection. SiRNA based-therapies could be promising treatment for these diseases as the durability of an RNAi-based virucide does not require an administration just before sexual intercourse, limiting the problems of compliance which are usually encountered with the use of classical microbicide. To investigate the ability of anti-HSV-2 siRNA to protect mice from HSV-2 virus, Palliser et al. pretreated mice with a progesterone derivative to arrest the mice in the diestrous phase of the estrous cycle, which may facilitate epithelial penetration [26] . The mice were then infected with a lethal dose of HSV-2 virus and treated with anti-HSV-2 siRNA formulated with the commercial lipid Oligofectamine\u00ae, two hours before and four hours after viral infection. Two siRNA were tested, targeting different essential viral protein, UL29 (a DNA-binding protein) and UL27 (envelope glycoprotein B). The results showed that only 25 % of mice treated with 500 pmol (approximately 7.5 \u00b5g) UL29 siRNA died compared with 75 % in control groups. On day 11 after viral infection, analysis of the disease severity showed robust protection against HSV-2 infection in UL29 siRNA-treated mice. Of interest, mice treated with UL27 siRNA were less protected, with only 60 % survival. Analysis of the vaginal mucosa of siRNA-treated mice on day 6 showed an intact epithelium with few apoptotic bodies compared with control mice, which showed a denuded mucosal epithelium and a high level of inflammatory cells. In a second study, these authors investigated the effect of an anti-HSV-2 siRNA treatment post infection. In this case, siRNA were administered alone or as a mixture, three and six hours after viral infection. Mice receiving only one siRNA present no survival advantages compared with control mice but, interestingly, mice receiving a mixture of siRNA had 80 % of survival, showing that post-exposure treatment could also be effective. It is also important to note that siRNA treatment does not elicit an immune response and inflammatory infiltrate. Nevertheless, Wu et al. showed that a lipidic reagent facilitated viral infection by eliciting a slight inflammation, which may be sufficient to enhance viral uptake [33] . Wu et al. investigated improving the durability of protection and to optimizing delivery systems in a mouse model of herpes simplex virus [33] . They developed cholesterol-conjugated siRNA with a single phosphothiorate linkage that protects against siRNA degradation by genital fluid RNAses. They identified the cell surface receptor nectin-1 which is a receptor for HSV-2, as a possible target for RNAi-based therapy in the case of HSV-2. To assess the efficiency of chol-siRNA conjugated for vaginal delivery, mice were pretreated with a progesterone derivative, as previously described, and challenged with 2 \u00d7 LD50 HSV-2. Mice receiving two times approximately 30 \u00b5g nectin-1-siRNA conjugated with cholesterol were efficiently protected against HSV-2 infection only when the siRNA was administered prior to infection (up to seven days prior to infection). The authors reported that combining nectin-1 and UL29 siRNA led to uniform and significant protection against HSV-2, irrespective of the time of siRNA administration, before or after HSV infection. Moreover, intravaginal administration of chol-siRNA did not induce interferon or an inflammatory response. Thus, the use of cholesterolconjugated siRNA seems to improve protection against HSV-2 viral infection as cholesterol does not elicit an immune response.",

These authors identified a target gene encoding the b-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1), which is implied in Alzheimer's disease pathology. To assess the efficiency of Toc-siRNA/HDL in vivo, these particles were administered to the mouse brain by direct intracerebroventricular infusion with osmotic pumps, as described by Thakker et al. [42] . As compared with free Toc-siRNA, continuous injection of approximately 45 \u00b5g Toc-siRNA/ HDL particles for seven days led to a broader and intense transduction of Toc-siRNA with a significant reduction in target BACE1 mRNA expression at the hippocampal and parietal cortex (up to 60 % with Toc-siRNA/HDL compared with free Toc-siRNA in the parietal cortex). Thus Toc-siRNA/HDL particles enabled efficient gene-silencing in the brain using a 1000-fold lower amount of siRNA than in a previous study. Improvements in gene-silencing efficiency could be explained by a better uptake of siRNA, as the Toc-siRNA/HDL vector system may utilize the physiological lipid metabolism. Indeed, \u03b1-tocopherol may be transferred from glial cells to neurons via the receptor-mediated pathway with HDL-like particles.",

Bisanz et al. reported intratumoral siRNA delivery in a model of human PC3 cancer prostate cells induced in tibia [49] . One microgram of anti-integrin alphaV siRNA was formulated with a cationic liposome-based formulation composed of dipalmitoylethylphosphocholine,dioleoylphosphoethan olamine, dipalmitoylphospho-ethanoamine, and polyethyleneglycol. The authors reported a reduction of integrin alphaV expression and of 75 % reduction in tumor growth. To improve the targeting of siRNA delivery and considering that some tumoral cells have high folate receptor expression, Yoshizawa reported intratumoral siRNA delivery using folate-linked lipid-based nanoparticles in a model of human oral epidermoid carcinoma cell (KB) xenograft [50] . Another strategy consisted of using PEI-based delivery systems. Based on a tumor model of brain cancer, specifically a mouse model of glioblastoma with U87 cells growing intracranially, Grzelinski et al. demonstrated that intratumoral administration of 8 \u00b5g siRNA targeting the growth factor pleiotrophin complexed with PEI, led to the inhibition of xenograft growth [51] . In the same way, PEI-based delivery systems have been widely used for intratumoral siRNA delivery, as reported by Kim [56] . Interestingly, Han et al. have developed a chitosan-based hydrogel which displays a temperature-dependant liquid-solid phase transition and could be directly injected into the tumor site and gradually degraded by enzymes at tumor sites after complete release of siRNA [57] . In another approach, Crombez et al. used an N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG) peptide-based delivery vector for intratumoral siRNA delivery in different mouse tumor models [58] . Intratumoral administration of siRNA formulated with the peptide carrier MPG functionalized with cholesterol promoted efficient delivery of siRNA and reduced tumor growth in the different mouse tumor models.",

This is notably the case for siRNA therapeutic siRNA-027 (termed AGN211745), which is a chemically modified siRNA targeting the VEGF receptor 1 and which has entered a phase II trial seemingly proving a clinically significant improvement in visual acuity with no serious adverse events or dose-limiting toxicity in a relevant subset of patients [44] . * As reported here, various synthetic vectors for local siRNA delivery have been developed to improve efficiency of gene silencing. However, most of the synthetic vectors used for local siRNA delivery have been essentially optimized for in vitro applications, including Oligofectamine, TransIT-KO, chitosan or PLGA delivery systems. Moreover, some of them are commercial reagents without known composition, which would impair their optimization for further clinical development. Concerning mucosal siRNA delivery, lipid based delivery vectors are not the ideal vectors due to possible interaction with surfactants, notably in the lung. In the case of lung siRNA delivery, polymer-based delivery systems such as chitosan and conjugated delivery systems would be preferred. In the same way, vaginal administration of siRNA requires the use of polymer-based delivery systems, such as PLGA nanoparticles that are biodegradable and biocompatible. The use of PEGylated lipoplexes also seems to be efficient for vaginal siRNA delivery. Conversely, non-mucosal siRNA delivery does not require the development of sophisticated siRNA delivery systems. Indeed, efficient siRNA delivery in the central nervous systems is achieved using the commercially available vectors Lipofectamine and JetSI, or with conjugated siRNA as an alternative method. Nevertheless, intracerebral administration of siRNA is a highly invasive method that must be improved. In the same way, efficient intratumoral siRNA delivery is achieved using polymer-based delivery systems such as PEI or chitosan. All of these systems have previously been used for gene delivery but need to be optimized in order to reduce toxicity and improve efficiency. In this way, some studies have developed synthetic siRNA delivery especially designed for siRNA delivery such as aminoglycosides derivatives [59] . In the same way, GeRPS particles derived from baker's yeast or NiMos particles composed of b-gelatin nanoparticles have been specifically designed for oral siRNA delivery in order to avoid degradation of the siRNA by gastrointestinal enzymes, while promoting siRNA internaliza- Local siRNA delivery by non-viral vectors tion into target cells. This review clearly shows that siRNA delivery systems must be optimized depending on the route of administration by considering the specificity of each system. The major challenge remains the improvement of safety, which currently clearly impairs further clinical development of siRNA delivery systems. Moreover, it remains difficult to translate the results obtained in animal models to the human, because of anatomical and physiological differences between humans and other animals. Routes of administration used in experimental animals are also generally not suitable for the future administration of the treatment in humans. ",

When delivered orally, siRNA-TKNs remain stable and intact in the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract, protecting siRNA and preventing its release into non inflamed tissues. At the site of intestinal inflammation, the presence of high levels of ROS enables the degradation of TKNs, leading to the release of siRNA at the target site of inflammation.
