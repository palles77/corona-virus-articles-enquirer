In fact, the G+C% of influenza A viruses isolated from humans is lower than that of strains isolated from avian and the CG dinucleotide in an A/U context was preferentially eliminated from classical H1N1 influenza viruses during human-to-human transmission. [10] [11] [12] [13] By focusing on short oligonucleotide (2-to 5mer) occurrences, we previously found [14] [15] [16] time-dependent unidirectional changes for a wide range of oligonucleotides in genomes of influenza viruses, [17] [18] [19] Ebolaviruses and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) coronaviruses. 20 Notably, some oligonucleotides showed the time-dependent unidirectional changes occurring commonly across three influenza A subtypes that invaded independently from nonhumans at long intervals (for example, several decades). 16 We thus proposed that such changes should reoccur at a high probability after future invasions from their natural reservoir hosts.",

When focusing only on target sequences, 47 oligonucleotides were obtained; 42 were 19 nucleotide (nt), and the other 5 were 21 nt in length. To search siRNAs with long utility, we analyzed the time-series change in an abundance ratio of strains having the target oligonucleotides in the viral population, as follows. From the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) Influenza Virus Resource, 27 we first selected \u223c 10 000 influenza A strains isolated from humans who had a full set of eight segment sequences, and grouped the strains according to the serological subtype and the isolated year (or month). Specifically, as conducted in the previous time-series study, 16 we first selected a year with at least 10 strains of one subtype and then a subtype with 45 years fulfilling the threshold (\u2a7e10 strains). We thus selected H1N1, H3N2 and H1N1/09 (refs 17-19) (starting from 2009 and abbreviated pH1N1 in the database). In the case of pH1N1, a sufficient number of strains fulfilling the above threshold (\u2a7e10 strains) were available even per month; thus, the data for the conformable months were analyzed that allowed us to study the changes occurred within one outbreak.",

Timeseries analyses of all 47 siRNA targets, which are listed in Supplementary Figures S1-S3 , showed that approximately half of the targets were absent at least in one subtype. Here, to search siRNAs with wide utility, we focus on the residual half, each of which is present in all three subtypes, although the occurrence significantly differs among subtypes. Because of high mutation rate of RNA viruses, most targets clearly fluctuate in their occurrence and often disappear after or during a certain period ( Figure 1 ). Three subtypes are distinguished by different colors: H1N1 (blue), H3N2 (brown) and pH1N1 (green). Disappearance of targets in the viral population denotes a loss or reduction in usefulness of the respective siRNA. The most desirable target for long and wide utility should maintain an abundance near 1.0 in viral populations of all three subtypes during the most epidemic period; that is, almost all strains of the three subtypes always have the target in their genomes. There was no such target 19-mers, but there were two 19-mers maintaining the abundance near 1.0 for two subtypes, although the abundance for the residual subtype was very low (Figures 1a and b) . The data specified by green X-marks for pH1N1 in Figure 1b (Figures 1e and f) . These two are located in almost the same area in M gene (one base difference in their start position) but have one base change (G -4 A) on the inside that is responsible for the time-dependent compensatory change. The former is maintained by most strains in the early stage after invasion for all three subtypes, which have occurred independently at long intervals, but unidirectionally reduces its occurrence during human-human transmission (Figure 1e ). In contrast, the latter ( Figure 1f ) is almost absent in the early stage after invasion but begins to increase unidirectionally in H1N1 and H3N2 after a certain period. A strain that undergoes the G -4 A mutation progressively increases the abundance of its descendants. Because this unidirectional increase is observed for two independently invaded subtypes, the change may have a certain biological significance.",

Understanding the changes that occur during the early stage after a new invasion is undoubtedly important for preventing its worldwide pandemic, and the important issue is to know how quickly a major population of newly invaded viruses will change their oligonucleotide sequences and how long it takes to detect the directional decreasing trend of the interested oligonucleotide and assign its compensatory pair with the increasing trend.",

In this era of big data accumulation, the participation of experts in big data analysis is increasingly important for interdisciplinary efforts against worldwide threats posed by infectious microorganisms. In this study, we focused on zoonotic RNA viruses, whose reservoir hosts are vertebrates, but it is undoubtedly important to analyze other RNA viruses spread by bugs (for example, ticks and mosquitoes) that have caused serious emerging infectious diseases, such as Dengue fever and Zika virus disease. 31, 32 Notably, the present strategy is also useful for designing diagnostic reverse transcription-PCR primers with long utility.",

We calculated occurrences of siRNA target sequences in each influenza virus genome. To prevent possible misassignment from a large number of pH1N1 strains, relatively small numbers of human classical H1N1 strains isolated from 2009 were omitted from the present analysis. From VIRsiRNAdb, target sequences for 4 siRNAs for EBOV were downloaded on 30 September 2016. EBOV genome sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Virus Variation Database 29 on 3 January 2016.
