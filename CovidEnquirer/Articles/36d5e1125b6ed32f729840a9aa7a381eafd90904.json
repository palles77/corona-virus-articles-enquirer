Mice survived acute encephalitis if more than 5 \u00d7 105 cells of either type of the virus-specific T cell clones had been transferred into H-2-matched recipients by 1 day post-infection. Although the adoptive transfer of both types of the T cell clones suppressed viral growth and viral antigen-positive cells in the brains, a significant inhibition of virus replication by the cytotoxic T cell clone was detected prior to that induced by the helper T cell clone. Histologically, cell destruction was prominent in the brains of mice which received the cytotoxic T cell clone. These results demonstrate that both the CD8 \u00f7 cytotoxic T cell and the CD4 \u00f7 helper T cell can protect mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection in the central nervous system.",

Intracerebral (i.c.) infection with MHV-4 induces an acute fatal encephalomyelitis in almost all the laboratory strains of naive mice (Stohlman and Frelinger, 1978; Knobler et al., 1981) . Survivors show evidence of chronic demyelination and occasionally suffer severe hind leg paralysis. Various factors including virus strain, route of infection, genetic background and immune status of the host are known to modify the infection. Recently, some reports have focused on immunological therapy of MHV-4 infection in the CNS and demonstrated that in vivo treatment with antiviral monoclonal antibodies protected mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection (Buchmeier et al., 1984; Fleming et al., 1989) . In addition, adoptive transfer of CD4 + helper T cell (Th) clones which induce a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response also protects mice (Stohlman et al., 1986) . However, viral replication in the brains of these mice is scarcely affected by these therapeutic treatments.",

In this study we transferred MHV-4-specific T cell clones into infected mice and examined whether these T cell clones could protect mice from acute fatal encephalitis. Both types of T cell clones protected H-2-matched mice, accompanied by a significant inhibition of virus replication and clearance of viral antigen-positive cells in the CNS; however, the CTL clone was more active in terms of viral clearance. Thus, not only CD4 + Th but also CD8 + CTL can protect mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection in the CNS.",

The adoptive transfer of antiviral monoclonal antibodies specific for three structural proteins (S, M and N) can protect mice from a lethal infection (Buchmeier et al., 1984; Fleming et al., 1989; S.A. Stohlman, personal communication) . In addition, the adoptive transfer of CD4 \u00f7 DTH-inducer T cell clones also resuits in protection of mice from the infection (Stohlman et al., 1986) . Interestingly, protection mediated by adoptive transfer into C57BL/6 mice was not associated with a decrease in viral replication within the CNS but rather with neuronal protection. In the present study we demonstrate that the adoptive transfer of virus-specific CD8 \u00f7 CTL clones also protects mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection. In this case, however, protection is associated not only with decreased neuronal infection but also with a significant inhibition of viral growth. Thus, protection of mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection is always accompanied by inhibition of neuronal infection, irrespective of the therapeutic treatment. These findings support the hypothesis that neuronal infection is a major fatal factor in acute fatal encephalomyelitis induced by MHV-4 (Knobler et al., 1981 .",

While viral replication in the CNS was not inhibited in their study, viral replication was slightly suppressed following transfer of the CD4 \u00f7 Th clone P12B. The absence of detectable antibody in the recipients suggests that this was probably not due to provisional help for the secretion of neutralizing antibody. Although both CD4 \u00f7 Th clones (4B10 and P12B) induce a virus-specific DTH response, no other functions have been identified, which may be important for virus clearance.

Therefore, two components are necessary for target cell lysis. First, potential targets must be infected with MHV-4.

In addition, elevation of MHC class I antigen expression on glial cells following murine coronavirus infection has been described (Suzumura et al., 1986) . Taken together, these results suggest that glial cells represent the most probable targets of MHV-4-specific CTL. In fact, the adoptive transfer of the CD8 \u00f7 CTL clone PllD induced cell destruction and decreased the number of viral antigen-positive cells. To our knowledge, this finding is notable because there is little direct evidence that CTL can kill target cells in vivo as they do in vitro (Mullbacher and Ada, 1987) . Complete clearance of infectious virus from the brains was not observed by 8 days p.i. This phenomenon is similar to incomplete clearance of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus from the CNS following adoptive transfer of CD8 + T cells (Oldstone et al., 1986) . These findings may be due to the limited expression of MHC antigens in the CNS (Vitteta and Capra, 1978; Williams et al., 1980) In addition to lysis of virus-infected cells, CD8 + CTL can secrete a variety of lymphokines including IFN-T after target recognition. In fact, we have detected IFN activity in the culture supernatant of CTL clone PllD after stimulation with MHV-4-infected J774.1 cells, which we used as the targets in the CTL assays (unpublished data). Although direct lysis rather than secretion of IFN-T was suggested as the antiviral mechanism of CTL (Lukacher et al., 1984; Mullbacher and Ada, 1987) , it might be still worthy of consideration, especially in the CNS, an immunologically unique site. Furthermore, IFN-~, secreted by CTL would also facilitate in target recognition by CTL as a result of the up-regulation of MHC class I molecules on cells in the CNS.",

Fleming, personal communication) . Although adoptive transfer of virus-specific monoclonal antibodies or CD4 + T cells protects mice from a lethal infection, these therapeutic treatments cannot protect mice from demyelination. Their data suggest that MHV-4-induced demyelination is immune-mediated and that CD8 + T cells are responsible for the development of demyelination. Although we did not examine the effect of our CD8 + CTL clones on virus-induced demyelination in this study, future experiments may reveal the interaction between MHV-4, CD8 + T cells and cells in the CNS, providing important information on the mechanism of MHV-4-induced demyelination.",
