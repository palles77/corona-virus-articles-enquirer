The susceptible individuals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring's rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R 0 , is not a constant, dependent on the volume fraction of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R 0 . Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.",

The key is how to theoretically determine chemical reaction rate constants like k 1 , k 2 , k 2 , k 3 , k 4 , k 5 , k 5 expressed in two chemical reactions shown above. Once these parameters are known, the fractions of S, E, I, R can be predicted. The first step in MSIR model and the second and third steps in MSEIR model are one way irreversible chemical reactions. The last step in both MSIR and MSEIR models are reversible.

Someone may argue that human movement is an athermal process, while atomic, molecular, and colloidal particle movements are thermal driven. For athermal granular powder under a tapping process, we theoretically found that they behave like thermal systems and follow the stretched exponential pattern in term of tap density changing with the number of taps 16 .

Based on the data provided by CCDC, the peak time, the peak infected, the total infected based on the recovered data, and R 0 are estimated and shown in table I.

Based on the data provided by CCDC, we predict that the infected may peak at 158 days from Jan. 21, 2020 and may take a long time, more than a year, to drop to zero, though MSIR and MSEIR models give a slightly different estimation. The data of the infected don't match with the removed for both models: based on the infected data, the removed is predicted to be 8 and 13 times smaller than the actual reported according to MSIR and MSEIR models. If the removed data, either the recovered or the recovered plus the death, are reliable, the actual infected people is between 579488 and 941668 by Feb. 17, 2020.

Mathematical modeling and analysis of infectious disease transmissions 1-7 have been performed for a century. Its importance in understanding infectious disease transmissions and developing practical strategies for disease control and mitigation have been demonstrated. Challenges remain in difficult descriptions of human contact patterns and virus evolution, due to randomness of human interactions and unpredictability of virus growth especially for a new type of virus. The problems encountered in disease transmission area are similar to many-body problems encountered in chemistry and physics fields, where many entities like electrons, atoms, molecules, or nano-sized even micro-sized particles interact each other in a disordered manner.",

Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemics initially started some time in December 2019 at Wuhan, China, has infected more than 75000 people with over 2200 deaths so far. How long time this infectious transmission is going to last and when it will peak are critical information to make proper mitigation strategy. Utilizing the data provided by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) from Jan.21 to Feb.17, 2020, the fraction of the infected is predicted with both MSIR and MSEIR models and shown inFigure 4. From these data, we are able to determine the Fraction of the infected against virus particle volume fraction in (a) MSIR model with k 2 = 1, CT 1/2 exp( E 0 k B T ) = 1;(b) MSEIR model with k 3 = 1.5, k 5 = 1, \u03c6 m = 0.72, the maximum volume packing fraction of face-centered cubic packing structure, BT 1/2 exp( E 0 k B T ) = 4.

S 0 is assumed as 1, too. and make predictions. As shown in Fig.4 (b), both models predict that the infected may peak about 150 days from January 21, 2019. For MSIR model, the exact peak time and the peak values can be calculated with Eq. 24 with the parameters obtained from Fig.4, t m = 158 days and I m = 0.854, corresponding to 170826 infected individuals. For MSEIR model, we cannot have exact solutions to the equation but can estimate using Fig. 4 (b): the peak time is a little longer than the predicted with MSIR model, about 160 days, and has a higher infected fraction about 0.9, corresponding to about 180000 infected individuals. Both models predict a skewed distribution, implying that the fraction of the infected remains at high ends for a relative long time. Please keep in mind that these predictions should be strongly dependent on how the isolation measures are executed and how accurate the data are, which may affect the rate constants used in the calculations.",

The volume fraction of virus particles should lead to a dramatic increase in transmission rate, similar to percolation transition process. The common many-body problems encountered in chemistry and physics world can be resolved with the integration of Eyring's rate process theory and free volume concept, which has been demonstrated to work well for many multi-scale systems ranging from electrons to granular particles, even the universe 41 . This approach is therefore naturally applied to the disease transmissions. Attempt made in this article is to understand physical mechanisms of infectious disease transmissions using same categorical methods popularly employed in infectious disease transmission field. Although our focus is put on coronavirus (Covid-19) currently spreading around the world, the theoretical framework proposed in this article can be applied to other transmission diseases, too.The successful predictions are dependent on data accuracy. For every new type of a virus, the test, identification, diagnostic, and counting methods need time and effort to be properly established. It is fully understandable that the initial data don't reflect the true epidemic process. We utilize the official data released by CCDC to test our models. The predicted parameters shown inTable Ishould be used cautiously.Our approach is relatively simple and straightforward without involving complicated mathematical calculations, in comparison with other theoretical models available in the literature. Extra seasonal force doesn't need to be inserted into our model for demonstrating the seasonality of infectious diseases, as rate constants are temperature dependent.All rights reserved.
