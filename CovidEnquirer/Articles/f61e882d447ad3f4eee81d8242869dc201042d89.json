Other prominent features of AIR include visual field deficits and photoreceptor dysfunction in the setting of progressive unexplained vision loss. The role of inflammation is poorly understood in AIR. Since cytokines play a central role in the initiation and development of inflammation, we evaluated the presence of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in AIR patient sera. We demonstrate that IL-6 and CXCL9 are both elevated in AIR patient sera. Moreover, the presence and concentration of these 2 molecules appear to correlate with AIR patient disease severity. This cytokine profile, IL-6 and CXCL9, has been described to participate in a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Our study provides support for an activated inflammatory process in AIR and identifies possible mechanisms that can drive autoimmunity in this disease.",

Despite an unremarkable exam early in the disease course, patients have abnormal electroretinography and visual fields (Fox et al., 2016) . Typically, patients have no chorioretinal lesions; some may have low-grade intraocular inflammation. As the disease progresses retinal atrophy, retinal vascular attenuation and optic disc pallor may ensue along with further vision loss. Interestingly, antiretinal antibodies can also be found in healthy controls, patients with degenerative retinal disorders and patients with systemic autoimmune diseases with no ocular disease (Heckenlively et al., 1999; Shimazaki et al., 2008) . Thus, unlike paraneoplastic AIR, the specificity and the role of antiretinal antibodies in npAIR are poorly understood. Clinical response to immunomodulatory agents has also been variable, casting doubt on the inflammatory nature of this disease. Nevertheless, antiretinal antibodies and visual dysfunction are the hallmarks of npAIR and most patients are typically treated with immunomodulatory agents with the hope of slowing down the progression of disease (Forooghian et al., 2008; Davoudi et al., 2017; Adamus, 2017) .",

In addition, IL-6 has been shown to mediate and regulate the immune system most notably through proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T cells, and growth and differentiation of memory B cells and plasma cells. Furthermore, IL-6 is especially well-known for its ability to trigger inflammation by inducung the acute phase response and in this way IL-6 impacts acute and perhaps chronic inflammation. Although IL-6 is most often considered to be a potent inflammatory cytokine, it has also been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties. IL-6 has a complex signaling system consisting of two distinct signaling pathways and depending on the cell type, a different pathway is initiated. Recently, IL-6 antagonists (anti-IL-6R antibody) have been developed to block IL-6 from binding to its receptor, IL-6R, and ameliorate inflammation. A variety of cells produce IL-6 and several stimuli trigger IL-6 production, such as, other cytokines, (i.e. TNF-\u03b1 or IL-1\u03b2) and TLR ligation (Hunter and Jones, 2015) .",

Standard curves were established for the individual cytokine analyzed and the corresponding concentration value (pg/ml) was determined according to manufacturer's instructions. All samples were run in duplicate and in a masked fashion. The mean value was used as the final concentration for that cytokine. It should be noted that the lowest concentration detected in IFN-\u03b3 system was 16 pg/ml. Multiplex analysis revealed that the mean concentration of CXCL9 in 18 normal individuals was 129.4 pg/ml with a range of 38.4 to 383.9 pg/ml. In order to examine the predictive value of CXCL9 as a marker for AIR case status, we examined samples above versus below the 95th percentile (384 pg/ml) of the CXCL9 distribution among normal individuals.

Our findings of elevated IL-6 and CXCL9 underscore the prominent role of these cytokines in inflammatory and autoimmune processes.

Increasing evidence for IL-6 and CXCL9 has clearly implicated the involvement of these mediators in the development of autoimmune diseases. For example, the persistent production of IL-6 has been associated with causing the onset and development of autoimmunity (Hirano, 2010; Hunter and Jones, 2015) . In these disorders IL-6 acts as a B cell stimulatory factor and activates B cells into antibody producing plasma cells. IL-6 can also mediate T cell development in autoimmunity. In combination with TGF-\u03b2, IL-6 induces the differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th17 cells, thereby, making IL-17 available within the autoimmune environment. Alternatively, IL-6 has been reported to inhibit the ability of TGF-\u03b2 to induce regulatory T cells. It is this Th17/T-regulatory imbalance that is implicated in the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases (Tanaka and Kishimoto, 2012) The presence of IFN in human autoimmune diseases was first described in SLE patients in 1979, where its detection correlated with disease activity (Hooks et al., 1979) . The presence of IFNs in many of these autoimmune diseases is now recognized as an integral component of their pathologic process (Niewold, 2016) . IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 are the cytokines that trigger the expression of CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11. A major function of CXCL9 is to attract T cells that contain CXCR3 on their surface to the site of inflammation (Islam et al., 2016) . This chemokine plays a critical role in the migration of T cells from the blood vessel into the brain or retina (Lee et al., 2007; Morrell et al., 2011) .",

In humans CXCL9 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA and multiple sclerosis (Loos et al., 2006; Simpson et al., 2000) . Furthermore, the CXCL9 signature was enhanced in a murine model of a retinal degenerative disease, experimental coronavirus retinopathy (ECOR). ECOR is a disease triggered by a coronavirus in genetically susceptible animals (BALB/c mice) and is associated with antiretinal autoimmune reactivity (Detrick and Hooks, 2010) . The virus also replicates in the retina of genetically resistant mice (CD-1) but these animals do not develop a retinal degeneration nor do the mice develop antiretinal antibodies (Hooks et al., 1993; Detrick and Hooks, 2010) . In addition, elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were detected in the sera and enhanced gene expression for CXCL9 and CXCL10 was noted in the retina early in this disease . Notably, this cytokine profile was observed one day prior to infiltration of cells into the retina. These studies implicate CXCL9 expression in the development of retinal autoimmunity.",

A notable example is seen in Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), in which IL-6 is an independent prognostic marker associated with the disease progression (Seddon et al., 2005) . Additional studies identified that CXCL10 is highly expressed in the retina of AMD patients (Mo et al., 2010) . Whether or not these cytokines contribute to retinal pathology is still unknown.
