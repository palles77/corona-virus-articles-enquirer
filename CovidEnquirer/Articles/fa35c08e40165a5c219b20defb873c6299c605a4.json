To evaluate the diagnostic performance of laboratories an external quality assurance (EQA) study was performed in 2004. Participating laboratories (9/20) correctly detected anti-SARS antibodies in serum samples without false positive results in an immunofluorescence assay. In contrast, only 4/13 laboratories detected most of the anti-SARS antibody positive samples without false positive results using enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and/or immunoblot. The overall results clearly demonstrate that serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV remains at an early stage of development, with further technical improvements required, particularly with respect to the use of SARS specific EIAs.",

Significant variation is found in the virus load in different patients and clinical samples, which may relate to the severity of the disease, timing and quality of sampling (Peiris et al., 2003a,b) . As a consequence, with current knowledge, a negative RT-PCR result cannot be interpreted to exclude SARS-CoV infection. The detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV is therefore currently a gold standard for confirmation of SARS infection (Wu et al., 2004) .

Since only few laboratories have class 3 safety laboratory facilities and the experience for developing and evaluating in-house assays, commercial assays may be more suitable for SARS serology for laboratories with a low volume of testing. These results are also likely to be the result of the fact that limited international work had been performed or published on the technical development of the assays in use during the time this EQA was performed. A follow up EQA in 12-18 months time would be expected to show substantial improvement as laboratories have a chance to develop both the performance of in-house assays and refine testing strategies.",

Also a variety of different assay formats (e.g. IFA, EIA, IB) and antigen sources (e.g. purified virus, recombinant SARS protein, SARS specific peptides), contributes to the variability in performance. In this regard, the strategy of testing with peptide based assays as a single test should be avoided, since it appears from the laboratories using this approach there is a lack of specificity.

The evaluation of these assays based on the accessibility of well-characterized SARS-CoV positive sera is still a major problem for all laboratories and companies working on this task. In the WHO recommended diagnostic strategy, seroconversion is required to diagnose acute infection. For establishing serostatus, while sensitivity is very important for screening, due to the very low seroprevalence worldwide, sequential testing using various different antigens/methodologies is required to get acceptable positive predictive value. The present EQA could not take into account this objective of testing or different testing strategies; therefore it is difficult to assess the proficiency of each participant for acute diagnosis or serostatus determination.",

Nevertheless highly sensitive and good specific serology assays will help to improve the diagnostic performance of the laboratories with a clear benefit for the patient. The EQA performed for SARS antibody diagnostic proved a clear advantage for all participants, either by demonstrating an adequate performance quality or demonstrate the need for necessary technical improvements or the training of the laboratory personal.",
