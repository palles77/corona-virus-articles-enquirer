            "text": "Our understanding of the molecular role of the KDEL sequence has been enhanced significantly by the identification of the yeast ERD2 gene that encodes the HDEL receptor Semenza et al., 1990) . Furthermore, the ERD2 gene product is also essential for proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus and the secretory pathway in general (Semenza et al., 1990) . Two closely related mammalian homologues have been cloned Hsu et al., 1992; Tang et al., 1993) . The deduced amino acid sequence predicts that the KDEL receptor is an integral membrane protein having seven hydrophobic regions and a molecular mass of ,'~ 23 kD, which has been confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using a specific antibody . We have recently proposed that the KDEL receptor (KDEL-R) is an integral membrane protein containing six transmembrane domains with both NH2 and COOH termini on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Singh et al., 1993) , although a topology with seven transmembrane domains has also been suggested (Townsley et al., 1993) . The fact that this molecule indeed functions as the KDEL receptor has now been established by evidence from genetic Semenza et al., 1990) , biochemical Wilson et al., 1993) , and cell biological (Lewis and Pelham, 1992) approaches. An important question that remains unresolved concerns the ultrastructural localization of the receptor, a question that is the main focus of this paper.",

One useful way of defining this boundary in a functional sense is the 15\u00b0C block (Saraste and Kuismanen, 1984) that inhibits the entry of newly synthesized membrane proteins from the ER into the Man I compartment (Balch et al., 1986) . Within this framework one can now identify two distinct compartments through which proteins must pass before entry into the Golgi complex. The first is the rough ER itself, the site of synthesis, and the second is the organelle that is now generally referred to as the intermediate compartment (IC) (Hauri and Schweizer, 1992; Lippincott-Schwartz, 1993) .",

In the latter study, we used cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as a model system, and we showed that this virus both buds and acquires the first O-linked sugar, N-acetyl-galactosamine, on its M membrane protein in the IC. Furthermore, conditions that blocked vesicular transport, such as 14\u00b0C in vivo or GTP3,S in vitro, had no effect on transport from the rough ER to the IC, although these conditions, as expected, prevented the M protein from acquiring Golgi sugar modifications. Moreover, the compartment where MHV buds was enriched in p58, rab2, as well as in the KDEL protein PDI, which is often considered to be exclusively found in the rough ER from immunofluorescence studies. The latter finding was subsequently strengthened by the localization to the budding compartment of a novel HDEL calcium-binding protein, ERC 55, that was identified in HeLa cells (Weis et al., 1994) . In all of our studies using markers of the IC, as well as using PDI and ERC 55, the labeling consistently extended to one cisterna on the cis side of the Golgi stack, although we emphasize that because of the three-dimensional complexity of the Golgi stack, this cisterna is not apparent in all sections through the stack. We have proposed therefore that this cisterna is part of the IC, and that the bona fide Golgi complex would start at the next, second cisterna (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994; Griffiths and Rottier, 1992 ; see also Ellisman, 1985a, 1985b) .",

Kiekbusch, E. Berger, G. Warren, and T. Nilsson, manuscript submitted for publication). Our results demonstrate that the bulk of the KDEL-R is normally localized to both the Golgi stack and the intermediate compartment, and that increased concentrations reach the TGN when the cells are stressed either by virus infection or by extremes of temperature. medium with 10% serum. The MHV A59 was propagated in sac(-) ceils and was used to infect L cells for the localization studies, with or without streptolysin O treatment, as described (Krijnse-Loeker et al., 1994) . The conditions for infecting L cells with VSV-ts045 and for accumulating the G protein at 20\"C were as desoribed earlier (Griffiths et al., 1985) . For infecting cells with the WR strain of vaccinia virus see Sodeik et al: (1993) . The use of the vaccinia recombinant expressing the M protein of MHV is described earlier (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1992) . The SA:48 cells are a HeLa cell line stably overexpressing the human a-2,6-sialyltransferase having a 10--amino acid peptide tag (P5IM epitope) from the cytoplasmic domain of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein at the lumenal (COOH) terminus (see Rabouille, C., E Hunte, R. Kieksbusch, E. Berger, G. Warren, and T. Nilsson, manuscript submitted for publication). The characterization of the PSD4 epitope was done according to Soldati and Perriard (1991) . FOr the 20\"C \"blocks the ceils were incubated in \"air medium\" (Matlin and Simons, 1983) for 2 h at 20\"C; for the heat shock treatment, they were put in the same medium for 4 h at 43\u00b0C. FOr the treatment of the SA:48 cells with bafilomycin AI (Bowman et al., 1984;  obtained from the Kamiya Medical Co., Thousand Oaks, CA), the cells were allowed to internalize BSAgold (16 run) for 3 h (pulse) followed by an 8-h chase in the absence of gold and in the presence of 500 nM bafilomycin A1. The cells were given BSAgold (5 urn) for 10 rain before fixation to label early endosomes. To be sure that the bafilomycin treatment effectively neutralized low pH compartment parallel experiments were done at the light microscopy level using acridine orange (6 ttg/ml).",

Specific antibody was affinity-purified from positive antisera with the same peptide conjugated to a solid support. Since this COOH terminal sequence is identical between the two closely related mammalian KDEL receptors (Hsu et al., 1992) , this antibody will detect both forms of the receptor, and our localization studies here represent a survey of total KDEL receptors.

In a few experiments using the HeLa cells, a three-step labeling protocol was used whereby the primary antibody was amplified by a pig anti-rabbit antibody that was then detected by protein A gold (see Fig. 4 A). The antibody against rabl was made against the purified rablA protein, as described by Saraste, J., and B. Goud (manuscript submitted for publication). This antibody also crossreacts with rablB (Goud, B. and J. Saraste, manuscript submitted for publication). Antibodies against calreticulin (CaBP3), CaBP1, and CaBP2 purified from rat were raised in rabbits. The antigens were purified as described by Nguyen Van et al. (1989 and Rupp et al. (1994) .

Pieces of fixed rat liver, pancreas, and kidney that bad been fixed in the above mixture were kindly provided by Dr. J. W. Slot (Department of Cell Biology, University of Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Mouse L cells were infected with MHV and permeabilized with streptolysin O (SLO) as described previously (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994) . The latter publication also describes the treatment of SLO-permeabilized cells with GTP3,S (50/~M). HeLa cells, as well as the SA:48-HeLa cell line (see above), were infected with the WR strain of vaccinia virus, as before (Sodeik et al., 1993) . Veto cells were infected with the ts 045 strain of VSV for the 20\"C experiments, as described by Griffiths et al. (1985) . The cells grown in 6-cm dishes were rinsed with PBS and removed from the monolayer with either proteinase K on ice (20 t~g/ml in PBS for 2-3 min) or, in the case of L cells infected with MHV (without SLO), simply by squirting with PBS. A 16% solution of paraformaldehyde was added (final concentration '~4%) to these cell suspensions before centrifugation for 3 min at 1,000 g. The supernatant was removed and 4% para~rmaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 200 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, was carefully layered on the pellet. The cells were fixed for 4-24 h and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 5 rain. The SLO-trcated cells were fixed for 30 rain with 1% glutaraldehyde in 200 raM Hepes, pH 7.4, and scraped with a piece of Teflon. Pieces of these pellets were infused with sucrose, cryo-sectioned, and labeled with immunogold as described by Griffiths (1993) . Double labeling was done according to Slot et al. (1991) using a 1% glutaraldehyde step between the two sets of antibodies (see also Griffiths, 1993) .",

We therefore prepared cryosections of pieces of the seminiferous tubules of the mouse and labeled these with anti-KDEL-R. In these sections, we searched for the early spermatid stages in which the acrosome is beginning to form around the tip of the nucleus of the developing sperm. During these stages, the Golgi complex is extremely pronounced and clearly polarized. The labeling of the Golgi stacks was extensive but essentially all the label was found on membranes at the cis side of the stack (Fig. 1) . The TGN had extremely low levels of labeling. However, in evaluating many Golgi stacks, it was clear that this low level of TGN labeling was much higher than that seen over the matrix of the nucleus, by definition, background.",

A thawed cryosection of a mouse early spermatid labeled with the anti-KDEL-R. Note the abundance of labeling associated with the cisternae on the cis (C) side of the Golgi stack. The trans/TGN (T) elements, which have extensive regions coated with clathrin in these cells (see Grifliths, 1981) , have only very low levels of label (arrowheads). The elements can also be identified by being directly adjacent to the developing acrosome (A), which overlays the nucleus (N). Bar, 200 nm. Oprins et al., 1993) . Consistent with the results in spermatids, the bulk of the label for the receptor in the PAC was associated with one side of the Golgi stack, both on cisternal, as well as tubulovesicular structures (not shown). The rough ER was very poorly labeled. Since the condensing vacuoles serve as a trans marker in these cells, we could conclude that the bulk of the KDEL-R was associated with the cis side of the Golgi stack of PAC. We also examined the labeling with anti KDEL-R on sections of liver and kidney from both rat and mouse. In both tissues, the bulk of the label was on or close to theiGolgi stack and, as in the pancreas and spermatids, preferentially concentrated on one side of the stack (results not shown).",

These observations suggest that some KDEL-R epitopes might not be accessible to the antibody because of masking by either cytosolic factor(s) or, in some structures, because of the high packing of membrane (e.g., the rough ER system in the PAC). To overcome these potential problems, we used an alternative approach, described recently (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994) , to investigate the subcellular localization of the KDEL-R. Mouse L cells, both uninfected as well as after infection with MHV for 6 h, were permeabilized with SLO to remove the bulk of the cytosol and the putative soluble masking factor(s). The ceils were then fixed and thawed cryosections were processed for immunogold labeling. This approach not only facilitates the visualization of detailed membrane structures (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994) , but it also allows us to identify the intermediate compartment, marked by the budding profiles of MHV. There was variable labeling throughout the Golgi stack (Fig. 3, D and E) . In most cases, essentially the entire Golgi stack was heavily labeled with gold particles (Fig. 3  E) . There was also a strong labeling of the IC/MHV budding compartment (Fig. 3, A-C) . A significant amount of gold particles were also detected in the rough ER (Fig. 3 , A and D) and the nuclear envelope ( Fig. 3 E) , although the extent of the labeling was clearly less than that seen over the IC and Golgi stack.",

In a recent paper, Pind et al. (1994) showed by immunoelectron microscopy that rabl is enriched in the tubular-vesicular structures where the G protein of VSV is enriched when ER to Golgi transport is blocked. By immunofluorescence microscopy these structures colocalized with p58, the marker of the IC. Whereas the well-established markers of the IC such as p58/p53 or rab2 are often in relatively low levels for immunogold labeling, when we tested an affinity-purified antibody against rabl, we noticed that this marker appeared to and p58 (small arrowheads, 10 nm gold).

Whereas the early stages of the virus acquire their membranes from the IC to form the intracellular mature virus (IMV), at a late stage in the infection, the IMV becomes enwrapped b y a cisterna that originates from the TGN (Schmelz et al., 1994) . In sections of cells infected for >8 h with vaccinia, these wrapping membranes can easily be identified. The use of a vaccinia recombinant expressing the M protein of MHV gave us a second marker for the TGN since, after a cycloheximide chase, the bulk of this protein in this system is localized to the trans-Golgi/TGN under these conditions (Krijnse-Locker et al., 1992) . Sections were made of L cells infected for 8 h with the M protein recombinant vaccinia virus. These were double labeled for the KDEL-R and for the M protein. The two proteins exten-sively colocalized and this colocalization extended to the membranes enwrapping the virions (not shown; see below). Thus, in two different viral systems, the KDEL-R appeared to be found in extremely high amounts in the TGN. This result was clearly at variance with the very low levels detected on the trans side of the stack, both in the tissues and the uninfected HeLa and NRK cells. Since the KDEL-R labeled the whole stack in the MHV-infected L cells, these data collectively suggested that, after viral infection, the distribution of the KDEL-R shifts from the cis side towards the TGN.",

These cells were then prepared for immunocytochemistry and double labeled as before for the KDEL-R and the G protein tag. A quantitative analysis of these experiments gave the following results. After the 20\u00b0C incubation, 56% of the Golgi stack-associated labeling for the KDEL-R was detected on the trans side, while after the heat shock treatment, the corresponding value was 46 %. These results suggest that the shift of the KDEL receptor towards the TGN side of the stack may be a general response to conditions of cellular stress. A recent paper from the Pelham group has provided in vitro data showing that binding of KDEL ligands to permeabilized Golgi membranes is highest at acidic pH (optimal pH. '~5) . We therefore asked whether the localization of the KDEL receptor was affected by bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton ATPases (Altendorf et al., 1989) . For this, the SA:48 HeLa ceils were filled with 16-nm gold-BSA (to mark late endosomes and Figure 9 . Double labeling of SLO treated L cells infected with the ts 045 VSV and switched to 20\u00b0C (plus cycloheximide) using anti-KDEL-R (KR; arrowheads, 10 nm gold) and anti-G protein spike (GP; small arrows, 5 nm gold). Note the extensive TGN elements (T) that label significantly for both the G protein and for the KDEL-R. The close packing of G protein into morphologically distinct quasicrystalline assays in the TGN at 20\u00b0C has been previously documented (see Griitiths et al., 1985 Griitiths et al., , 1989 . These assays (parallel bars), as well as the numerous buds that accumulate (/arge arrows), are diagnostic features of the TGN under this condition. The G protein labeling also extends throughout the stack although it is often lower on the cis side (note the stack on the lower left part of A). Some residual G is also present in the rough ER (R), and a small amount evidently leaked to the plasma membrane (P). Bars, 100 nm. lysosomes, after an overnight chase) and subsequently with 4-nm gold-BSA for 5 min (early endosomes) before fixation. For the last 8 h before fixation, the cells were treated with 500 nM bafilomycin A1. This treatment effectively neutralized low pH compartments since by light microscopy we observed the loss of acridine orange staining of endosomes/ lysosomes (results not shown). The endocytic compartmentmarked, bafilomycin-treated, SA:48 cells were then doublelabeled with anti G tail (6 nm gold) and anti-KDEL-R (10 nm gold). Under this condition, there was no significant labeling of any endocytic structure (not shown). When we quantitated the KDEL-R labeling over the Golgi stack, as above, there was no change in the distribution of the receptor (with 18% of the receptor on the trans side of the stack and 82 % on the cis). These data argue that bafilomycin has no effect on the distribution of the KDEL-R.",

These cells were sectioned and double labeled with antibodies against the KDEL-R and B-COP. After GTP-yS treatment, there was extensive proliferation of buds/vesicles that labeled with anti-B-COP in single labeling studies (not shown). When the sections of this preparation were double-labeled with anti-B-COP and anti-KDEL-R, there was extensive colocalization of the two markers (Fig. 11, A-C) . In MHV-infected cells, many of these buds were continuous with the IC, defined as membrane profiles into which the MHV assemble (Fig. 11 D; see Krijnse-l_x~ker et al., 1994) . Thus, a significant fraction of the COP buds containing detectable amounts of KDEL-R labeling appear to be derived from the IC.

We operationally define the first of the Golgi compartments as that where Man I functions. This notion would be consistent with the fact that this is the first N-linked oligosaccharide modification seen after release of the 15\u00b0C block (which defines the ER to Golgi boundary) (Balch, 1989 ). In the present paper, we provide additional support for our model. First, we show that rabl is an excellent marker for the IC since it precisely colocalizes with both p58 (which is a less abundant marker) in both uninfected cells and in MHV-infected cells. In many cases, the labeling for rabl extends to the first (and occasionally two) cisternae of the Golgi stack. Further, we provide additional evidence that KDEL proteins are also enriched in the IC. In most cases, these KDEL proteins are only in very low amounts in central parts of the Golgi stack. It should again be emphasized that a more definitive definition of the boundary between the IC and the bona fide Golgi complex awaits the availability of high titer antibodies against early Golgi proteins. A consequence of this problem is that it is difficult at present to estimate how much of the rabl is found in the Golgi compartments distal to the IC.",

Under no condition did we detect any significant amounts of this protein in any compartment distal to the TGN. In many, but not all of the cell types we examined, the labeling extended to membrane elements peripheral to the Golgi stack. The bulk of this labeling was localized to the IC, which we could convincingly identify in the SLOpermeabilized, MHV-infected L cells by the presence of budding virions. In these cells, the concentration of the receptor in the IC, as estimated by quantitation of the immunogold labeling, was similar to that observed in the Golgi stack. In these cells, we could also detect a significant (albeit fivefold lower than the IC/Golgi) labeling of the rough ER and a still lower level in the nuclear envelope. In these SLO-treated cells, the accessibility for the cytoplasmic epitopes of the KDEL-R for the antibody was clearly enhanced on the sections. This was evident from a comparison of the labeling of permeabilized with nonpermeabilized cells. Therefore, in the absence of the permeabilization step to remove cytosolic components, the anti-KDEL-R may have significantly less accessibility to its antigen on the section. This point should be considered in evaluating the absence of detectable labeling in the rough ER of cells such as the pancreatic acinar cells.",

It should be noted that, for all of the virally infected cells we used, host protein synthesis is effectively switched off.

The TGN is the major site where the endocytic pathway converges with the exocytic pathway (Griffiths and Simons, 1986; Duncan and Kornfeld, 1988; Neefjes et al., 1988; Green and Kelly, 1990) , and recent studies have shown that the effects of some toxins, which enter the cell via the endocytotic pathway, depend on their COOH-terminal, KDEL-like sequence (Chaudhary et al., 1990; Pastan et al., 1992 and references therein; Pelham et al., 1992 and references therein) . Indeed, the cytotoxic activity of some toxins could be enhanced by having the KDEL sequence on the COOH terminus (Seetharam et al., 1991) . Furthermore, a KDEL-containing ER glycoprotein, calreticulin (CaBP3), acquires significant amounts of galactose, a trans-Golgi modification, in rat liver (Peter et al., 1992) . These observations, in conjunction with the localization of some KDEL-R to the TGN, suggest that KDEL receptor-mediated retrieval from this compartment may be involved in the transport of these toxins to the ER, where translocation to the cytosol has been proposed to occur (Pastan et al., 1992; Pelham et al., 1992) . A recent study by Sandvig et al. (1992) has now directly demonstrated that endocytosed Shiga toxin could be transported to the ER, most likely via the TGN and the Golgi stack.",

A significant finding in the present study was the presence of easily detectable levels of the KDEL-R in these GTP-yS-arrested COP buds and/or vesicles. Using the MHV (as well as rabl: see Fig. 5 A) to identify the IC, we can conclude that at least some of these buds/vesicles originate from the IC, and that they are probably involved in anterograde traffic from the IC into the Golgi complex (presumably the Man I compartment). The simplest interpretation is that the \"empty\" receptor follows the normal vesicular traffic route from the ER (IC) to the Golgi. Whether any of the COP vesicles may also be involved in the retrograde trafficking pathway can only be investigated when a suitable system becomes available for following this retrograde transport step in more detail.",

This observation is significant since it is consistent with the generally accepted model for KDEL receptor function. Accordingly, the receptor would bind ligand in a downstream compartment and recycle it back to an upstream organelle that, by definition, must have a different lumenal environment necessary for the ligand to dissociate (Munro and Pelham, 1987; Pelham, 1988 Pelham, , 1989 . A recent study has shown that the binding of KDEL ligands to Golgi membranes in vitro is enhanced at relatively low pH (,05) . Although this suggests that pH may be an important factor for binding in vivo, this notion is hard to reconcile with other lines of evidence that argue in favor of a neutral pH in the pre-TGN compartment(s) of the Golgi complex (Griffiths and Simons, 1986; Anderson and Orci, 1988) . In this study, bafilomycin A1 had no effect on the distribution of the receptor. While the precise role of pH in the binding of KDEL ligands to the receptor in the cell remains to be elucidated, our data argue that the \"downstream\" organelle where the KDEL-R binds its ligands is the Golgi complex, while the upstream (dissociation) organelle would be the IC. The number of compartments comprising the Golgi is still controversial (see Mellman and Simons, 1992) . However, the finding of low but variable labeling for the KDEL-R in the TGN would necessitate, at a minimum, one additional recycling step from the TGN back to earlier compartments.",
