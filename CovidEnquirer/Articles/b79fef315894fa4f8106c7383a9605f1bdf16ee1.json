            "text": "Measles, a highly contagious infectious disease of man caused by a paramyxovirus, is associated with a CNS complication known as post-infectious encephalitis. This disease occurs with a frequency of 1 in 1000-2000 patients and has a fatal outcome in 10-20% of the cases (Miller et al., 1956) . The pathogenesis of post-infectious encephalitis is not understood. Histopathologically a perivenous demyelinating encephalomyelitis is found without detection of measles virus antigen. Most attempts to recover infectious virus from brain tissue have been unsuccessful, suggesting that measles virus probably does not replicate in the brain during post-infectious encephalitis (Gendelman et al., 1984) . At present it is thought that an autoimmune reaction to CNS tissue may play a pathogenetic role since in some patients with this CNS disease peripheral blood lymphocytes proliferate in vitro in the presence of MBP . However, definite proof of an existing immune-mediated process in post-infectious encephalitis is missing. In view of the medical importance of measles virus infection and its possible association with chronic inflammatory CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis, it is desirable to study the aspect of measles virus-induced autoimmune reactions in an experimental animal model. In the following, experiments are presented which document that in Lewis rats humoral and cell-mediated immune reactions to MBP of potential pathological significance occur during the course of a non-demyelinating subacute measles virus encephalomyelitis.",

Single cell suspensions (107/ml) were cultured in medium to which indomethacin (2 #g/ml, Sigma, Munich, F.R.G.), and the relevant antigen were added. The basic medium (BM) for all T cell cultures was RPMI 1640 (Biochrom, West Berlin, Germany), supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM), sodium pyruvate (1 mM), non-essential amino acids (1%), 2-mercaptoethanol (0.05 mM), antibiotics and 1% syngeneic rat serum. After 72 h viable cells were separated by centrifugation on a Ficoll density gradient (Pharmacia, Freiburg, F.R.G.) and expanded for 3-10 days in BM containing 10-15% TCGF and 10% FCS. T cell growth factor (TCGF) was obtained as follows. Spleen cells from Lewis rats were cultured for 24-36 h at 10 7 cells/ml in BM containing 2% fresh rat serum, 2 ffg/ml indomethacin and 5/~g/ml concanavalin A (ConA, Pharmacia). The cell suspensions were centrifuged, and the conditioned supernatants pooled and stored at -20 \u00b0 C. Their ability to maintain T cell growth was tested with a TCGF-dependent T cell line and concentrations of 15-20% were used in all experiments. After expansion the T cell lines (2-4 \u00d7 10S/ml) were mixed with irradiated (3000 R) syngeneic spleen and thymus cells serving as antigen presenting cells (APC, 8 X 106/ml) and cultured in presence of optimal concentrations of antigen. Alternating cycles of restimulation in presence of irradiated APC and antigen, and propagation in TCGF containing media were repeated at intervals of 10-14 days. At each restimulation the cells were tested in vitro for antigen specificity.",

Approximately 40% of the diseased animals died during the course of this monophasic disease and no relapses have been noted in survivors.

Infectious virus could not be recovered either directly from brain homogenates or by cocultivation techniques, and viral antigen was only occasionally detected in sporadic cells (Fig. 1B) . Animals which were killed at various intervals after recovery from clinical disease had neuropathologically either persisting inflammatory lesions or residual changes typical of a previous encephalitic attack in the absence of immunohistologically demonstrable viral antigen.

Although the observed stimulation indices (SI) for MBP are low in SAME when compared to those animals with EAE (group 4) the mean SI (2.3, groups 1 + 2) is still higher than that of those controls not exposed to MBP (groups 5, 6 and 7, mean = 0.97). This cellular response to MBP was detected for up to 270 days post-infection. However, in those animals which had recovered from SAME and histologically had no signs of an active encephalitis no significant in vitro proliferation to MBP was observed (group 3). Furthermore, positive proliferative responses to MBP in the various control groups were only seen in animals in which EAE was actively induced (group 4). Moreover, all measles-infected (groups 1-3) or immunized (group 7) animals exhibited a significant proliferative response to measles virus independent of their clinical and neuropathological status. In the control groups 4, 5 and 6 which had not been exposed to the virus no proliferative response to MV could be elicited.

In addition, graded doses of cells of the line MBP-SAME3 were adoptively transferred After harvesting cells were washed twice and injected into the tail vein in a volume of 0.5-1 ml. Animals were weighed and observed daily for clinical signs of EAE, and disease severity was graded on a scale from 0 to 5 (Lassmann, 1983) . into recipients. Cells injected were either freshly activated with MBP or ConA, or 'resting T cells' were injected following expansion in TCGF for 10 days. As can be seen in Table 5 , activation with either antigen or mitogen was effective to a similar degree. A dose above 1 x 106 of these cells was able to produce clinical signs of EAE and there was a marked increase in the clinical severity of the disease when more cells were transferred. Within 7 days 85% of the recipients exhibited clinical signs of EAE. Adoptive transfer of 6 x 107 resting T cells into naive recipients was completely ineffective. The recipients developed neither clinical nor histological signs of EAE.

These lymphocytes not only proliferate in the presence of MBP, but in adoptive transfer experiments proved to be encephalitogenic in naive syngeneic recipients.

In this model JHM virus induces in weanling rats a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) which is characterized by an inflammatory reaction with marked demyelination. In the course of a persistent JHM virus infection in brain tissue a T cell-mediated immune reaction against MBP develops. The MBP-specific T cells led in adoptive transfer experiments to the induction of EAE. There are, however, important differences to the SAME animal model. In JHM virus-induced SDE the target cells for the virus are glial cells (Nagashima et al., 1978; Massa et al., 1986a, b) , demyelinating plaques reveal infected cells, and infectious JHM virus can always be recovered from SDE brain tissue (Wege et al., 1984) . Contrary to this, the principle target cells for measles virus in SAME are neurons, the disease is inflammatory and demyelinated plaques are not detected. Infectious measles virus cannot be isolated from SAME rats and viral antigen is only occasionally found (Liebert and ter Meulen, 1987) . The different target cells and virus-cell interactions in the two models conceivably influence pathology and disease course. Yet, a T cell-mediated autoimmune reaction to MBP of unknown pathogenetic role develops in the course of both JHM and measles virus infections in brain tissue. In the case of SAME MBP-specific T cells possibly maintain the inflammatory CNS reaction in those animals with a persisting encephalitis in the absence of measles virus, whereas in JHM-SDE the autoimmune reaction to MBP is thought to be involved in the development of the relapsing SDE occurring in some of these animals (Wege et al., 1984) .",

It has been shown that viral infections may trigger the production of T and B cell responses that cross-react with host cell proteins by a mechanism termed molecular mimicry (Notkins et al., 1984) . In addition, monoclonal antibodies against viral structural proteins including those of measles virus, have been obtained which also recognized cellular antigens (Fujinami et al., 1983; Sheshberadaran and Norrby, 1984) . In few instances such cellular antigens have been identified by sequence analysis. For example, amino acid sequence homologies have been found between the encephalitogenic portion of rabbit MBP and the hepatitis B virus polymerase (Fujinami and Oldstone, 1985) , and between oligopeptides of human myelin proteins and measles virus nucleocapsid and C proteins (Jahnke et al., 1985) . However, these reported sequence homologies are not identical to the peptides which represent either the major or the minor encephalitogenic determinants of MBP for the Lewis rat (Alvord, 1984; Martenson, 1984) . In SAME animals, no cross-reactivity between antibodies directed against measles virus or MBP was observed. Furthermore, MBP-specific T cell blasts from SAME animals did not react with inactivated measles virus and conversely the MV-specific line failed to proliferate in the presence of MBP suggesting that molecular mimicry between measles virus proteins and rat MBP is unlikely. However, it cannot be ruled out that cross-reactivity exists between measles virus and other potentially encephalitogenic proteins such as the proteolipid protein (Williams et al., 1982; Yoshimura et al., 1985) which do not have any sequences homologous to MBP.",

Additionally, viral infection may result in a general polyclonal activation of the immune system including those clones which recognize self antigens. Such mechanisms acting in conjunction with the induction of Ia antigen on astrocytes (Fontana et al., 1984) could be a determining factor for the development of an immune pathological reaction in the course of a CNS viral infection (Massa et al., 1986a, b) . In the case of a high level of Ia expression on astrocytes, inappropriate presentation of self antigens may occur as has been suggested in autoimmune processes (Londei et al., 1984) .",

However, it must be noted that not only do SAME animals have a high MV-specific T cell response, but MV antigens are also detected in some animals. This observation indicates that the cell-mediated immune response to measles virus could also play some role in the development of the CNS lesions. Future experiments will clarify this point, but it is now apparent that CNS measles virus infection can lead to a putatively pathogenic autoimmune response by triggering or potentiating the proliferation of pre-existing MBP-specific T cell clones in SAME animals. In addition, there is evidence that a persistent measles virus infection in hamsters supports the development of EAE when such animals are challenged with MBP in complete adjuvant (Massanari et al., 1979) . Whether the measles virus renders the CNS more vulnerable to immunological injury or potentiates a cell-mediated immune response to myelin in this model has not yet been elucidated.",

The mean onset of clinical symptoms was 4 days post-cell transfer (6 x 10 6 cells) with all MBP-specific T cell lines. In contrast, the two MV-specific T cell lines (MV-SAME4, MV-SAME5, 6 x 107 cells) induced neither clinical nor histological abnormalities in naive recipient rats. Animals having received T cell lines were killed and the CNS was examined for neuropathological changes and for evidence of measles virus replication. Histologi-Fig. 2.
