Ensuing floods rendered intensive care units (ICUs) nonfunctional. 5, 6 News headlines in 2008 estimated that more than 100,000 people died in Myanmar 7 as a consequence of cyclone Nargis and almost 70,000 people died following earthquakes in China last spring. 8 Fortunately, in the wake of these events, medical response to disasters significantly evolved. [9] [10] [11] Most recent disasters around the world have witnessed brisk execution of well-structured, integrated response, albeit with occasional operational flaws. 12, 13 Much of this progress has occurred as a result of governmental policy shifts that followed disasters. 14 In the United States, for instance, there has been a clear increase in focus on disaster preparedness since the events of September 11, 2001. 15 At the government level, we witnessed the creation of the Department of Homeland Security to streamline and improve the efficiency of multiple response agencies. 16 In addition, the ongoing scientific, 17, 18 technical, [19] [20] [21] and educational advances [22] [23] [24] and their integration with disaster medicine 25, 26 have advanced our ability to respond to disasters. For example, we have increased capability of transporting very sick patients, 27, 28 improved early detection of unusual and previously unidentified microbes, 29 and enhanced our ability to rapidly acquire information from disaster scenes through mobile telecommunications systems, global positioning, and telemedicine technologies. 30 What lessons can we learn from these events and from other disasters over the last many decades? Despite the varied nature of these catastrophes, many critical care themes are common to all:",

Even so, lessons can be learned about the gaps in reporting and communication and the secrecy of the authorities at the time. This failure to inform generated fear, rumors, and uncertainty. 39 There could be very high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder after a major radiation exposure. Groups particularly at risk include children, pregnant women, mothers of young children, and emergency workers. Prevention is essential through openness and communication. 43 Another important lesson from Chernobyl is that a major radiation incident also results in thermal and radiation burns, wounds, fractures, and other trauma injuries, thus adversely affecting the prognosis of the patient. The immune function may become compromised, predisposing patients to sepsis. Compromised immune function was observed for Chernobyl firefighters and should be a treatment priority. 44 These lessons have assumed greater significance in the context of the current geopolitical realities. The ongoing oil crisis makes it likely that there will be more reliance on nuclear production of energy. Although global nuclear war may be less likely than in the past, terrorist use of radiologic weapons is an increasing threat. 45 ",

Posttraumatic stress disorder may have more significant longer-term negative ramifications than we earlier believed. 46 It is anticipated that in the event of a nuclear disaster, a casualty stream would include significant numbers of patients with both traumatic injuries and radioactive contamination. Critical care preparedness should include provisions (ie, decontamination access) to deal with both problems. 40 Potassium iodide is touted as an ''antidote'' to ''radiation poisoning.'' Remember, however, that this is protective only to the thyroid gland. Complete critical care planning includes a triage plan for radiation-exposure victims. This plan should incorporate a predictive matrix that projects severity of illness and probability of survival (based on probable radiation-dose exposure). Table 1 offers an example. Others employ more complicated methodologies, such as rate of lymphocyte depletion. The secondary radiation risk to health care workers from exposure to contaminated casualties (or their excreta, body fluids) is limited. 41",

As a safety valve gave way, a plume of methyl isocyanate gas escaped, killing around 4000 people immediately. 47 The injured soon overwhelmed the local hospitals, a crisis deepened by a lack of knowledge of exactly what gas was involved. 47 The number of people killed in the first few days are estimated at 10,000. 47 At least 200,000 48 and, according to some reports, more than 500,000 people were exposed to the gas.

Following the initial release of methyl isocyanate, an estimated 200,000 people sought medical care. 49 The city had four major hospitals but there was a shortage of physicians and hospital beds and no mass casualty emergency response system was in place in the city. 49 The greatest numbers of patients seeking care in such disasters are often those who perceive they have been poisoned, but do not exhibit obvious signs or symptoms of poisoning. 50 Many of these patients may have no exposure, and are merely worried. 51 Demands from these anxious people decrease the ability of the medical system to effectively triage and identify the most critically ill patients. 49 This event can be circumvented by planning for treatment of thousands of patients at the same time. 52 This event in Bhopal dramatically highlighted the threat to the first responder, as was proven later in the sarin incident in Tokyo where almost 10% of the 1364 first responders sustained injured. 53 These injuries to first responders were related to inadequate training and preparation. 54 The events in Bhopal revealed the disastrous consequences of expanding industrialization in developing countries without simultaneous investment in safety regulations. 55 Accidents involving hazardous toxic materials are predicted to occur predominantly in developing countries. 56 However, the sarin poisoning incident in Japan revealed that developed nations may be equally vulnerable. 57 The danger to communities from hazardous materials accidents is continuously on the rise. Of the 70,000 chemicals used industrially in the United Kingdom, more than 2000 are considered harmful and 200,000 tons are transported daily. 50 In the United States, 15 events of gas release exceeding the Bhopal incident in quantity and toxicity occurred during the 1980s. 49 Over 80,000 chemical agents commonly produced, transported, or used in the United States are toxic enough to rapidly produce lifethreatening conditions. 49 Even so, a survey conducted in 2003 revealed gross underpreparation. 58 With the heightened threat of deliberate offensive use of chemical warfare agents, it is imperative that hospitals be adequately prepared to handle such large-scale disasters 59 through an effective response strategy, 60 drawn on basic toxicologic principles. 49 ",

Nevertheless, these items required the same logistical support to unload or store, thus redirecting time and energy away from important relief efforts to things that were not as helpful. 97 A hasty response that is not based on familiarity with local conditions contributes to more chaos. It is prudent to wait until real needs have been assessed. 98 False alarms were raised about the probability of more deaths from secondary epidemics than from the tsunami itself. 93 These ''overly alarmist announcements'' related to problems that did not materialize provide valuable lessons in appropriate and responsible disaster communication.",

Specifically, there were numerous secondary casualties-patients with chronic critical illnesses who lost access to care rapidly became ill. 106 These patients consumed a significant amount of the available rescue medical care. 107 A number of lessons pertinent to critical care were (re)learned at a very high cost. 108 The foremost was how much the delivery of critical care services depends on support services, such as water and electricity. The worst hit hospital in New Orleans was Charity Hospital. Rising floodwaters submerged the hospital's emergency electrical generators. This left no reliable electrical power for life-support systems, such as mechanical ventilators, suction machines, bedside monitors, intravenous fluid pumps, and dialysis machines. Even air conditioning was lost. 109 Radiology and laboratory capability became extinct. Patients who required positive-pressure ventilation had to be hand ventilated with bag-valve devices in total darkness. 6 Lesson in evacuation surge capacity Many hospitals were incapacitated simultaneously. 110 This left the option to either deploy field hospitals or to evacuate. Unfortunately, portable critical care exists only at certain facilities and is generally not developed as a deployable asset. Therefore, all hospitals in general and especially those located in regions subject to hurricanes and earthquakes should make extraordinary investments to develop coalition partners and to ensure portability of sophisticated care. 111 A reasonable solution would be collaboration across regions to enable long-distance patient and staff transfer during emergencies. 112 Adequate knowledge of the operational status of surrounding facilities expedites such transfer. The Department of Health and Human Services Critical Infrastructure Data System was employed to track the local, state, and national availability of medical care for hurricane victims following Hurricane Rita in 2005. A means of rapidly assessing the needs of the affected area would allow proper resource deployment and use. 113 ",

Today, from time of injury a casualty is typically evacuated back to the United States within 72 to 96 hours, and may have had several incremental surgical procedures performed along the way. 130 This approach has resulted in the lowest died-of-wounds rate in the history of warfare. 131 These critical care teams were developed and are maintained by the U.S. Air Force. They are part of the Critical Care Aeromedical Transport Team program. 132 These teams are capable of providing all aspects of critical care, including advanced mechanical ventilatory support; invasive cardiovascular monitoring; pharmacologic support, diagnosis, and treatment of sepsis or other forms of shock; limited laboratory assessment; portable ultrasound; portable bronchoscopy; and even extracorporeal support in limited circumstances. 133 Much of this occurs in austere settings, such as the back of an Air Force cargo plane during flights from the Middle East to Germany, and again across the Atlantic Ocean. 134, 135 Relevance to Today and Clinical Teaching Points Provision of critical care in a transport setting imposes unique challenges, particularly when the duration of patient transfer is prolonged. 9,136 As a simple example, monitoring technologies must overcome limitations imposed by noise. Automated blood pressure monitors, measurement of oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide with limited electrocardiography may represent the only available cardiopulmonary monitoring. Ventilators must offer a range of tidal volumes, but a limited number of modes may be available. Variable minute ventilation must be provided over a wide range of barometric pressure conditions. Infusion devices must be compact and robust with extended battery life and pressure-activated occlusion alarms. Only point-of-care laboratory testing may be available in remote settings and in the transport environment. Finally, a limited drug list must be developed to include provision for analgesia and sedation, and to accommodate the need for vasoconstriction, inotropic support, or vasodilatation with various shock states.",

Following a disaster, existing critical care resources may be insufficient to meet demand for services. Developing a deliberate plan (5) that pre-identifies alternative care sites for ICU patients is essential. This must include access to sufficient quantities of 50 psi oxygen, suctioning, medical devices, and necessary pharmacy support. 4. Following a disaster of sufficient magnitude, non-critical care hospital personnel will be called to assist with the care of ICU patients. It is important to know, in advance what will be the scope of practice of these individuals, what education is needed to ensure that this care is efficient and of reliable quality, and who will provide supervision and assistance for these activities. 5. Following a disaster, it is vitally important to ensure the protection of ICU personnel from communicable diseases/outbreaks, as well as physical harm. This requires a plan, practice, and proper education of staff. 6. When a large scale disaster occurs, medical care processes quickly migrate below usual standards of care due to resource limitations. This degradation of care should be planned and not haphazard. This can also be pre-planned as it relates to access to mechanical ventilation, staffing ratios, aggressiveness of resuscitation based on probability of survival, etc. The goal is to predictably orchestrate transition from ''standard of care'' to ''sufficiency of care.'' Except for individuals who volunteer their time or who are engaged in disaster preparedness, there is generally a limited willingness by health care professionals to accept that these concerns as relevant to their daily professional lives.
