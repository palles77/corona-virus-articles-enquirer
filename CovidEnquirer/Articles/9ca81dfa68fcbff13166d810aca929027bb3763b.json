            "text": "While numerous studies have explored single-word naming, few have evaluated the behavioral and neural correlates of more naturalistic language, like connected speech, which we produce every day. Here, in a retrospective analysis of 120 participants at least six months following left hemisphere stroke, we evaluated the distribution of word errors (paraphasias) and associated brain damage during connected speech (picture description) and object naming. While paraphasias in connected speech and naming shared underlying neural substrates, analysis of the distribution of paraphasias suggested that lexicalsemantic load is likely reduced during connected speech. Using voxelwise lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM), we demonstrated that verbal (real word: semantically related and unrelated) and sound (phonemic and neologistic) paraphasias during both connected speech and naming loaded onto the left hemisphere ventral and dorsal streams of language, respectively. Furthermore, for the first time using both connected speech and naming data, we localized semantically related paraphasias to more anterior left hemisphere temporal cortex and unrelated paraphasias to more posterior left temporal and temporoparietal cortex. The connected speech results, in particular, highlight a gradient of specificity as one translates visual recognition from left temporo-occipital cortex to posterior and subsequently anterior temporal cortex. The robustness of VLSM results for sound paraphasias derived during connected speech was notable, in that analyses performed on sound paraphasias from the connected speech task, and not the naming task, demonstrated significant results following removal of lesion volume variance and related apraxia of speech variance. Therefore, connected speech may be a particularly sensitive task on which to evaluate further lexical-phonological processing in the brain. The results presented here demonstrate the related, though different, distribution of paraphasias during connected speech, confirm that paraphasias arising in connected speech and single-word naming likely share neural origins, and endorse the need for continued evaluation of the neural substrates of connected speech processes.",

To successfully retrieve a word, such as the name of an object, one must access at least three levels of information: conceptual (what it is), lexical (its associated word) and phonological (the sounds to select and organize). When we describe a situation, however, we do not simply name objects. Instead, we select two or three words per second from an active vocabulary spanning an estimated 40,000 words (Levelt, 1989) , and making this feat more complex, our word selection is vulnerable to \"competition\" from multiple sources. For example, errors in connected speech tend to be phonologically or semantically related word substitutions or omissions, the replacement of the intended target word with a word that we intended to use in a future production, or the perseveration on a word that was used recently (Lashley, 1951; Garrett, 1975) . Selecting a word in connected speech, therefore, requires a delicate balance of target word activation and suppression of alternatives, where alternatives come in the form of previously selected forms, subsequent forms in various stages of planning, and similar competitor forms, all coordinated across multiple hierarchical levels.",

Indeed, connected speech production likely depends on cognitive operations that extend beyond lexical processing (Fergadiotis and Wright, 2015) alongside a lexical retrieval system where activation of word forms is dynamically changing across the course of the utterance. One step in evaluating the lexical retrieval processes during connected speech has been through the use of blocked cyclic picture naming, where subjects repeatedly name pictures in sets of either semantically related or unrelated pictures, cycling several times through the pictures in each block.",

Semantic interference may result from lexical competition, such that competition grows more intense when retrieving words in a homogeneous context because of the growing number of competitors (i.e. semantically related words) but semantic interference may likewise result from impaired inhibition, such that lexical competitors cannot be suppressed 4 (Oppenheim et al., 2010) .

            "text": "A handful of prior studies have evaluated neurogenic communication disorders, such as post-stroke aphasia, to compare the distribution and properties of word-level errors (paraphasias) during connected speech and single word retrieval. It seems intuitive that the underlying processes involved in producing a paraphasia on the two tasks should be similar, and for the distribution of such errors on one task to predict the distribution on the other. However, there are reports of patients with aphasia demonstrating superior word retrieval during confrontation naming compared to connected speech (Manning and Warrington, 1996; Schwartz and Hodgson, 2002; Wilshire and McCarthy, 2002) and vice versa (Zingeser and Berndt, 1990; Ingles and Mate-Kole, 1996; Pashek and Tompkins, 2002) . It is therefore becoming increasingly evident that connected speech requires dynamic changes in the linguistic system, resulting in differing distributions of linguistic components compared to naming. An early study evaluated word retrieval deficits in picture naming (the Boston Naming Test) and word-finding difficulty for nouns during connected speech production and found a ~58% overlap in variance between the two variables (Nicholas et al., 1989) . A later study evaluated naming performance and connected speech in 14 participants with mild and moderate aphasia, finding that there was superior word retrieval and overall more self-corrected errors during the connected speech task and that naming ability was not significantly correlated with connected speech paraphasias (Mayer and Murray, 2003) . Further evaluation by other groups suggested that naming ability may relate more to the ability to retrieve nouns, in particular, during everyday conversation (Herbert et al., 2008) . Further, a recent study in 98 participants with aphasia found that picture naming ability was not predictive of the proportion of paraphasias made during connected speech, finding that paraphasias produced in discourse in isolation were not well predicted by performance on confrontation naming tests (Fergadiotis and Wright, 2015) . Taken together, these studies encourage the direct comparison of the distribution of paraphasias between connected speech and naming for improved understanding of the dynamic lexical retrieval system employed during natural speech. Explanations regarding the reason for the discrepancy of paraphasia distributions between connected speech and single word retrieval have revolved around the differential context-dependent, non-linguistic demands required by connected speech as well as by linguistic factors such as the effects of lexical neighborhood and phonemic similarity (Foygel and Dell, 2000; Penn, 2000; Pashek and Tompkins, 2002) .",

Paraphasias were coded as phonemic using pre-determined parameters for the number of shared phonemes of the production with the target. Briefly, phonemic paraphasias refer to the substitution of a word with a nonword that preserves at least half of the segments and/or number of syllables of the intended word. The specific criteria for identifying a phonemic paraphasia were as follows. For one-syllable words, consisting of an onset (initial phoneme or phonemes) plus vowel nucleus plus coda (final phoneme or phonemes), the error must match on two out of three elements: onset plus vowel nucleus, vowel nucleus plus coda or onset plus coda. The part of the syllable that is in error may be a substitution, addition, or omission. For one-syllable words with no onset (e.g., eat) or no coda (e.g., pay), the absence of the onset or coda in the error was also counted as a match. For multi-syllabic words, the error must have complete syllable matches on all but one .

This analysis was conducted on the two task groups: CS and PNT. We used the proportion of each type of paraphasia (neologistic, phonemic, semantically related, unrelated) as the dependent variable. Voxelwise data were analyzed at p<.05 (one-tailed) with 5000 permutations (Winkler et al., 2014) . Cluster thresholding was then employed (z>2.33, p<0.01) and corrected for multiple comparisons using nonparametric permutation (5000 permutations; Winkler et al., 2014) . Specifically, the order of operations for this analysis was as follows: 1) compute voxelwise statistics for 5000 permutations, 2) zero all voxels less than z=1.645 (p>0.05), 3) measure the number of voxels in the largest surviving cluster and save this variable, 4) rank order the 5000 observations of max cluster size, 5) threshold at the 100 th largest cluster size (i.e. given random data, we observed only a single cluster of this size in 1% of the permutations) and 6) zero all voxels less than z=1.645 and zero all clusters smaller than the cluster identified in step #5. This cluster thresholding is part of the VLSM software detailed in Wilson et al., (2010) as well as in our own program, NiiStat (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/niistat/). VLSM analyses were conducted on voxels in which at least 10% of participants shared a lesion. To correct for lesion volume, we used Freedman-Lane permutation correction with lesion volume as a nuisance variable (Winkler et al., 2014) . As some paraphasias significantly correlated with apraxia of speech (AOS) severity in the connected speech condition, we also regessed AOS severity (a score of 0 to 4 where 0 means no AOS; scores derived from the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale, ASRS Strand et al., 2014) from these error types using Freedman-Lane permutation.",

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/544841 doi: bioRxiv preprint assumption regarding VLSM is that results will generalize beyond the specific participants included in the analysis. There are two possible challenges for this assumption when comparing two distinct groups of subjects: 1) that lesion distribution is significantly different between task groups, and 2) that the number of participants with lesion damage per parcel is significantly different between task groups. We addressed these assumptions, below, and provided a supplementary table (Supplementary Table 2 ) of lesion proportion damage and number of participants with damage to each parcel. 1) Lesion distribution was not significantly different between task groups, which we demonstrated at both the voxel-and parcel-level (gray-and white-matter parcels derived from the Johns Hopkins University [JHU] atlas, [Faria et al., 2012] ). There was no significant difference in proportion damage at the voxel-level between task groups (z-score range: -3.34 -4.10), which was calculated using a two-tailed Liebermeister test (p<0.05) and FDR correction for multiple comparison (Rorden et al., 2007) in all left hemisphere voxels where at least 10% of people had damage. Further, there was no significant difference in lesion damage to any parcel between task groups (z-score range: -1.80-2.579), which was calculated using a two-tailed t-test (p<0.05) and FDR correction for multiple comparison in all left hemisphere parcels where at least 10% of people had damage. Prior to multiple comparison correction, six parcels had a score of z>1.96 (therefore, where the PNT task group had more lesion proportion damage than the CS task group): a posterior section of the middle frontal gyrus (two-tailed z=2.579, p=0.0099), white matter (superior corona radiata) (two-tailed z=2.572, p=0.01), precentral gyrus (two-tailed z=2.517, p=0.012), postcentral gyrus (two-tailed z=2.127, p=0.033) and white matter (anterior limb of internal capsule) (two-tailed z=2.099, p=0.036). Figure 1B displays these parcels. However, given no statistical significance after multiple comparison correction, we stipulate that lesion distribution was not significantly different between task groups.",

When both lesion volume and apraxia of speech severity were regressed, the pattern of damage associated with neologisms was similar. Phonemic paraphasias, when regressing variance from only lesion volume, were significantly associated with damage to more left hemisphere dorsosuperior areas as compared to neologisms, centering on supramarginal gyrus, precentral gyrus and middle frontal gyrus (posterior segment) but subsequent regression of apraxia of speech severity alongside lesion volume did not result in significant clusters for phonemic paraphasias. This is likely the result of sampling, where the sample with apraxia of speech also tended to present with more anterior lesion damage. Semantically related paraphasias were most associated with damage to left hemisphere posterior superior and middle temporal gyri, extending anteriorly into superior and middle temporal gyrus, and also included damage to angular gyrus and underlying white matter (superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus).

            "text": "We first explored the differences in paraphasia proportion made during connected speech and naming. In the CS+PNT subgroup, we found that semantically related paraphasias occurred more often on the naming task than on the connected speech task, while unrelated paraphasias occurred more often on the connected speech task. An explanation for this finding is that the classification of verbal paraphasias in connected speech may be inherently difficult, as it is challenging to definitively know the intended target of a word when there are many possible targets. However, as demonstrated by the excellent inter-rater reliability on error coding across raters, this is unlikely to be the driving component behind the difference in the proportion of semantically related paraphasias across tasks. Further persuasive evidence toward the argument that verbal paraphasias were correctly classified in the connected speech task comes from the clear differentiation of lesion maps for each paraphasia type in both tasks (e.g. verbal paraphasias associated with ventral stream damage; sound paraphasias with dorsal stream damage) and the similarity in lesion maps for each paraphasia type across tasks (e.g. semantically related errors in both naming and connected speech associating with damage to left anterior temporal cortex). There are reasonable explanations for the difference in verbal paraphasia proportion across the tasks. Connected speech provides additional context in the form of prior word and future word selection, and the semantically related paraphasias that do occur during connected speech likely suggest a problem with semantic selection rather than a downstream problem of lexical selection. Therefore, the naming task may require higher lexical-semantic load than the connected speech task, a supposition that is supported by semantic interference demonstrated during blocked cyclic picture naming experiments (Schnur et al., 2006; Oppenheim et al., 2010) . There is another possible explanation for the reduced proportion of semantically related paraphasias made during connected speech. During picture description, one can avoid talking about certain objects, whereas in picture naming, one is required to come up with a name for the picture. This may lead to a significantly smaller proportion of semantically related paraphasias in connected speech. Therefore, while there may be a reduced lexicalsemantic load in connected speech, there are other strategies, such as circumlocution, that contribute to the reduced proportion of semantically related paraphasias made during connected speech. The overall greater . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/544841 doi: bioRxiv preprint proportion of unrelated paraphasias (always real words) and larger proportion of phonemic paraphasias and neologisms during connected speech also suggests an increase in lexical-phonological load, in keeping with the evidence proposing that several lexical items are selected simultaneously during connected speech (Kempen and Huijbers, 1983 ). An additional contributor to increased lexical-phonological load, aside from stress imposed by prior and future word choice and multiple word selection, is that connected speech is produced at a faster rate than the words produced during a picture naming task. Dell (1986) suggested that, when speech rate is increased, the available time for the spreading of activation across the language system is reduced, therefore activating incorrect items/sounds. In this way, previously activated items remain active because they have not had enough time to decay whilst new correct items have not received enough activation to compete at the same intensity. Indeed, we found that the number of neologisms made in the CS task group significantly correlated with the number of unrelated and phonemic paraphasias also made during connected speech whilst the number of neologisms made in the PNT task group did not significantly correlate with any other paraphasia type produced during naming. This postulates that lexical bias and phonemic similarity occur more often during connected speech (Oppenheim and Dell, 2008; Nozari and Dell, 2009; Oppenheim et al., 2010) .",

While this result-that paraphasias in both connected speech and naming associate with areas of shared damageseems straightforward and perhaps not novel, few studies have evaluated brain damage associated with paraphasias during connected speech (e.g. in primary progressive aphasia: Wilson et al., 2010) . As noted in the introduction, the two larger studies to do so focused on different populations (post-stroke aphasia; primary progressive aphasia) and also evaluated only one type of paraphasia (phonemic). In the present study, we find that verbal paraphasias, made during connected speech and naming, were associated with shared lesion damage to specific brain areas in the left hemisphere. Semantically related paraphasias have been long attributed to neurodegeneration (Jefferies and Lambon Ralph, 2006; Noppeney et al., 2007) or stroke damage (Cloutman et al., 2009; Schwartz et al., 2009; Lambon Ralph et al., 2012; Griffis et al., 2017) involving left anterior temporal cortex, and this is reflected in our conjunction analysis which demonstrated that semantically related paraphasias made during both connected speech and naming localized to this area. Further, brain damage associated with unrelated paraphasias made during both tasks was localized to left posterior temporal cortex, an area which has been implicated most often in lexical .

In people with poststroke aphasia, semantic naming errors are most commonly taxonomic-or entity-specific (Jefferies and Lambon Ralph, 2006; Binder et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2011) , where the resultant error is related by category, such as \"apple\" named as \"pear\". Semantically related paraphasias in our connected speech samples, which were likewise overwhelmingly taxonomic in nature, associated with more left anterior temporal lobe damage, suggesting subtle disruption of a more specific taxonomic-or entity-specific system.",

Supportive evidence for this comes from studies of focal damage to the left middle temporal gyrus, suggesting that this damage results in profound language comprehension and semantic deficits (Hart and Gordon, 1990; Hillis and Caramazza, 1991; Kertesz et al., 1993; Dronkers et al., 2004) . We likewise showed that unrelated paraphasias made during connected speech-real words for which the target was unrelated or unknown-associated with left posterior temporal (especially middle and inferior temporal gyri) and left temporoparietal damage, indicating that disruption in areas recruited early on in the lexical-semantic system likely lead to verbal, but not phonological, paraphasias. Further, we demonstrate that damaged cortex in left posterior middle temporal gyrus area associated with semantically related and unrelated paraphasias made during both naming and connected speech, highlighting a role for this area of cortex in lexical selection. Our results, which evaluate verbal paraphasias for the first time in connected speech, support prior suppositions from single-word retrieval that the left posterior temporal lobe, in particular, has an early position in lexical-semantic access, at least during naming from visual recognition, and that the more anterior left temporal lobe, an area recruited downstream of the processes occurring in the left posterior temporal lobe, is an area whose role is more specific, likely for semantic entity knowledge.",

As neologistic errors likely arise from phonological selection and/or substitutions, this result supports the supposition of the role of the dorsal stream in phonological retrieval (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007; Schwartz et al., 2012) . In general, few studies have evaluated brain damage associated with phonemic paraphasias in aphasia comparative to verbal paraphasias, and they have differed in their conclusions as to the loading of phonemic paraphasias onto the left hemisphere dorsal or the ventral stream of language (Kreisler et al., 2000; Schwartz et al., 2012) . We found phonemic paraphasias during connected speech to be associated with frontoparietal left hemisphere brain damage. Notably, this result was only significant after removing variance from lesion volume but not apraxia of speech severity, suggesting a role for both word selection and motor planning in phonemic paraphasias produced during connected speech. Of particular interest is the robustness of VLSM results for sound paraphasias (neologistic, phonemic) derived during connected speech. In the present study, analyses performed on sound paraphasias from the connected speech task, and not the naming task, demonstrated significant results following removal of lesion volume variance and related apraxia of speech variance. Therefore, connected speech may be a particularly sensitive task on which to further evaluate lexical-phonological processing in the brain.",

While we found that underlying brain structures are shared between paraphasias across tasks, at least as measured by lesion analysis, our behavioral analysis reflects subtle changes in linguistic load across tasks. While logically, a paraphasia should arise from damage to a brain area associated with the category of the paraphasia (i.e. left hemisphere anterior temporal lobe and semantically related errors), and therefore brain damage associated with paraphasias in connected speech and naming should be similar, there is a body of literature in neurotypical adults and adults with neurogenic communication disorders that connected speech involves the interaction of brain areas important for cognitive processes not usually found in single-word retrieval, such as inhibition and working memory (Coelho et al., 1995; Wright et al., 2014; Schnur, 2017) . The multiword environment present during connected speech is prone to many processes not at play during single-word retrieval, including lexical bias (Nozari and Dell, 2009) , phonemic similarity (Dell, 1984) , and perhaps even semantic interference (Schnur et al., 2006; Oppenheim et al., 2010) . We suggest and have first shown here that studying the neural substrates of paraphasias in connected speech share brain areas also associated with paraphasias of naming, but we further suggest that studying paraphasias in connected speech extends our understanding of the neurobiology of language. In the present study, we employed lesion-symptom methods largely focused on identifying the convergence and divergence of brain damage associated with paraphasias in both connected .

Future work evaluating functional and structural connectivity may elaborate on the relative contribution of extra-linguistic cognitive processes to paraphasias produced during connected speech. In the current study, we analyzed a single naturalistic measure of connected speech, picture description, but we acknowledge that other forms of connected speech may be more naturalistic, such as story retelling and procedural descriptions, and encourage future work to evaluate these tasks in order to more comprehensively evaluate the spontaneous language system.",

When comparing lesion damage to each parcel between the CS and PNT task groups, there was not a significant difference between lesion proportion damage to a parcel after multiple comparison correction (FDR; q=0.05). Prior to multiple comparison correction, six dorsal stream parcels were significantly more damaged in the PNT task group than the CS task group at p<0.05 (z>1.96); these are shown in the figure.

As in Figure 4A , variance from lesion volume has been regressed from all analyses, and for the CS task group, we present neologistic and unrelated areas with apraxia of speech variance also regressed. Phonemic paraphasias are not demonstrated here, as there was not a significant cluster for phonemic paraphasia in the PNT task group after lesion volume regression or for the CS task group after both lesion volume and apraxia of speech severity regression. This figure demonstrates the distinction in dorsal and ventral streams associated with sound and verbal paraphasias, respectively. Figure 5 . Conjunction analysis of verbal paraphasias between tasks. As verbal paraphasias in the connected speech and naming tasks significantly associated with lesion damage, we performed a conjunction analysis to identify the region(s) that were significantly associated with semantically related and with unrelated paraphasias in both tasks. A cluster of damage to more anterior, ventral stream areas, comprising superior and middle temporal gyri, was associated with semantically related paraphasias in both tasks (top) while a cluster of damage to more posterior, ventral stream areas was associated with unrelated paraphasias in both tasks (middle). There was an area of overlap in posterior superior and middle temporal gyri significantly associated with both semantically related and unrelated paraphasias in both tasks (bottom).",

A retrospective sample of 120 participants was further classified into two mutually exclusive groups for use in the VLSM study: CS task group, which included participants with a connected speech assessment, and PNT task group, which included participants with a naming assessment. The PNT task group was matched, using case-control matching, on the aphasia severity of the CS task group. To directly evaluate behavioral distribution of paraphasias, we evaluated a subgroup of the CS task group, which we have called the CS+PNT subgroup because members of this group had both a connected speech and naming assessment. Notably, members of this group were not included in the PNT task group, as we created the CS and PNT task groups (for VLSM analysis) to be mutually exclusive. .

Table 3 : Left hemisphere voxels that, when damaged, significantly correlate with paraphasia type by task group. Here we present left hemisphere parcels containing voxels that, when damaged, significantly correlate with paraphasia type (neologistic, phonemic, unrelated, semantically related) for each task group (CS, PNT). To do this, we parcellated the lesion images using the Johns Hopkins University atlas, which includes gray and white matter (Faria et al., 2012) . We then extracted the maximum z-score of voxels reaching significance within each parcel (\"Peak Z\" in table) and reported the coordinates of the maximum voxel (\"X Y Z Coord.\"). We report areas within the significant cluster, as described in the VLSM methods. All analyses included lesion volume as a covariate.
