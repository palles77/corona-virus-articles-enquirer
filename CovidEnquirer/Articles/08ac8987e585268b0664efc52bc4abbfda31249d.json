(Top Panel) Branched PepC7 with first disulfide bond formed by dissolving the linear peptide in 0.1 M NH 4 HCO 3 (1 mg/ 3 mL, pH 8) followed by the addition of 2,2\u00a2-dipyridyldisulfide (1 mM) in methanol (0.2 mL/1 mg). (Middle Panel) Iodine oxidation of the Acm-protected Cys residues using a 10-fold excess of I2 per Acm as 20 mM I2 solution in acetic acid, 60 min at room temperature. (Bottom Panel) Iodine oxidation using a 20-fold excess of I2 per Acm, 30 min at room temperature.",
