            "text": "The maturation of SARS coronavirus involves the autocleavage of polyproteins 1a and 1ab by the main protease (Mpro) and a papain-like protease; these represent attractive targets for the development of anti-SARS drugs. The functional unit of Mpro is a homodimer, and each subunit has a His-41/Cys-145 catalytic dyad. Current thinking in this area is that Mpro dimerization is essential for catalysis, although the influence of the substrate binding on the dimer formation has never been explored. Here, we delineate the contributions of the peptide substrate to Mpro dimerization. Enzyme kinetic assays indicate that the monomeric mutant R298A/L exhibits lower activity but in a cooperative manner. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses indicate that in the presence of substrates, the major species of R298A/L shows a significant size shift toward the dimeric form and the monomer-dimer dissociation constant of R298A/L decreases by 12-to 17-fold, approaching that for wild-type. Furthermore, this substrate-induced dimerization was found to be reversible after substrates were removed. Based on the crystal structures, a key residue, Glu-166, which is responsible for recognizing the Gln-P1 of the substrate and binding to Ser-1 of another protomer, will interact with Asn-142 and block the S1 subsite entrance in the monomer. Our studies indicate that mutation of Glu-166 in the R298A mutant indeed blocks the substrate-induced dimerization. This demonstrates that Glu-166 plays a pivotal role in connecting the substrate binding site with the dimer interface. We conclude that protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions are closely correlated in Mpro.",

During the outbreak in 2003, this virus infected >8000 people and the fatality rate in humans was as high as 15% (World Health Organization). In 2004 and 2005, the discovery of two more species of CoV that infect humans, NL-63 and HCoV-HKU1, confirm the high mutating rate and genetic recombination within Coronaviridae (2, 3) . The fact that the virus is easily transmitted between humans makes the reemergence of SARS and other human CoVs a distinct possibility and has resulted in an urgent need to understand these viruses and their coding proteins.",

Recently, structures of other CoV Mpros such as TGEV, IBV, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been solved (7) (8) (9) . Although the overall sequence identity of these Mpros is only 40-50%, the three-dimensional structures, especially the regions of dimer interface, catalytic dyad, and substrate binding site, are highly conserved (10) . Therefore, the design of broad-spectrum inhibitors of Mpro appears to be feasible for drug development (11) .",

The N-terminal domain is a monomer that is able to fold correctly but is catalytically inactive (14) . The extra domain III increases the structural stability of the catalytic domain by increasing the folding rate. Furthermore, domain III is involved in the dimerization of Mpro, which has important functional implications for this enzyme (15) . The side chain of Arg-4 at the N-finger (residues 1-7) of protomer A fits into a pocket of protomer B and forms a salt bridge with Glu-290; this constitutes one of the major interactions between the two subunits (16) . Our previous studies have shown that N-terminal truncation of the whole N-finger results in almost complete loss of enzymatic activity (17) . Critical N-terminal amino acid residues up to Arg-4 and C-terminal residues up to Gln-299 have been identified as involved in dimerization and thus in generating the correct conformation of the active site (17, 18) .

            "text": "Compared with functional dimeric Mpro, the crystal structures of monomeric Mpro (G11A, S139A, and R298A) have provided direct structural evidence for the catalytic incompetence of the dissociated monomer (19) (20) (21) . In the monomer mutants, the oxyanion loop (Ser-139 to Leu-141) is converted into a short 3 10 -helix and completely collapses inward, as exemplified by the large movement of Asn-142 and Leu-141. The slipped Asn-142 interacts with the side chain of Glu-166 and blocks entry to the S1 subsite; this results in enzyme inactivation ( Fig. 1) (20) . All experimental results have indicated that the dimerization of Mpro is essential for catalysis. Here, we provide what we believe is a novel approach that shows the influence of substrate binding on Mpro dimerization. Various biochemical and biophysical techniques are used to demonstrate the importance of substrate-induced dimerization to the catalytic mechanism of Mpro. By mutagenesis studies, a key residue, Glu-166, is found to play a connecting role between the substrate binding site and the dimer interface. We believe that this study will help deepen our understanding of the correlation between protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions in Mpro. Such an understanding will aid the development of new approaches to control SARS-CoV and other CoVs.",

The polymerase chain reaction products were then treated with DpnI and transformed into Escherichia coli cells and checked by autosequencing. Next, the plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells. The cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium with 50 mg/ml Kanamycin at 37 C. After 3 h incubation, the cells were induced overnight by 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio-b-Dgalactoside at 20 C. For purification, all operations were performed at 4 C. The cells were centrifuged at 6000 \u00c2 g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellets were resuspended in the lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME), and 0.2% Triton X-100, pH 8.5). The cells were then sonicated using sixty 10-s bursts at 300 W with a 10-s cooling period between each burst. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 \u00c2 g for 25 min). Lysis buffer-equilibrated Ni-NTA slurry (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) (1 ml) was then added to the soluble lysate, followed by gentle mixing for 1 h. The mixture was then loaded into a column and washed with the washing buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 250 mM NaCl, 8 mM imidazole, and 2 mM b-ME, pH 8.5). Finally, the protease was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 30 mM NaCl, 150 mM imidazole, and 2 mM b-ME, pH 8.5).",

The sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments were performed in a double-sector epon charcoal-filled centerpiece at 20 C with a rotor speed of 42,000 rpm. The sample (330 ml) and reference (370 ml) solutions with or without different concentrations of TQ6-pNA substrate were loaded into the centerpiece. We found that the TQ6-pNA was cleaved and free pNA was released in the process of centrifugation (detected by absorbance at 405 nm). The absorbance spectrum of free pNA interfered with protein absorbance at 280 nm. Therefore, absorbance at 250 nm was chosen to detect the protein, which was monitored in a continuous mode with a time interval of 480 s and a step size of 0.003 cm. Three different protein concentrations (from 1.4 to 57.2 mM) were used to estimate the dynamic monomerdimer content. Multiple scans at different time intervals were then fitted to a continuous c(s) distribution model using the SEDFIT program (25, 26) . The partial specific volume of Mpro, the solvent density, and the viscosity were calculated by SEDNTERP (http://www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm) (cited Oct. 20, 2009). The sedimentation equilibrium (SE) experiments were performed in a sixchannel centerpiece. Three different samples (0.10-0.12 ml) were loaded into the sample channels and 0.11-13 ml buffers were loaded into the reference channels. The cells were then loaded into the rotor and run at multispeeding (8000, 12,000, and 15,000 rpm), each for 12 h at 20 C. Ten scans of absorbance at 250 nm at time intervals of 10 min were measured for every rotor speed to check the status of SE. In our studies, all Mpro and its mutants were able to achieve equilibrium state after 12 h. The SV results at three protein concentrations and the multispeed SE data were then globally analyzed using a monomer-dimer equilibrium model by the SEDPHAT program (27) , which gives a precise measurement for K d and the dissociation rate constant (k off ) (18, 28, 29) .",

This peptide is specifically cleaved by SARS-CoV Mpro at the designated site (Gln-pNA) to release free pNA, which results in an increased absorbance at 405 nm. Besides wild-type Mpro as a dimeric target, two single mutants, R298A and R298L, and one double mutant, R298A/Q299A, were chosen as the monomeric targets. According to previous studies (19) , mutation of R298 or Q299 will induce dimer dissociation and result in an~10-fold decrease in proteolytic activity (18) . When R298 and Q299 are both mutated, the enzyme activity decreases by 100-fold. Other studies also suggest that the monomeric Mpro by other mutations shows very low or no proteolytic activity (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) 31) . Indeed, in this study, we were not able to detect any enzyme activity associated with the R298A/Q299A double mutant. However, for the single mutants, R298A or R298L, the initial velocity pattern at various substrate concentrations displayed a sigmoid curve (Fig. 2, B and C) . The dimeric Mpro, on the other hand, exhibited a classical saturation curve (Fig. 2 A) . These results were then fitted to the Michaelis-Menten or Hill equations to evaluate the kinetic parameters. The best-fit results are shown in Table 1 . The K m (223 mM) and k cat (0.63 s \u00c01 ) of wild-type Mpro with TQ6-pNA substrate are close to observations from other laboratories (23, 32) . After fitting to the Hill equation, the k cat of R298A was sixfold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, R298L showed a k cat close to that of the wild-type enzyme. The Hill constants of R298A and R298L were 2.0 and 1.8, respectively. This nonunity number suggested that there is a strong positive cooperativity among the Mpro protomers. However, since the cooperativity phenomenon is not compatible with a monomeric form, we sought other evidence to examine the possibility of dimeric Mpro formation during the catalytic process.",

The line represents the best fit to the nonlinear dependence equation (Eq. 3). of R298A/L shifted from 2.9 S to 3.8-3.9 S. The distribution now became a broad peak between the monomer and dimer, but closer to the dimer. In a fast dissociated and associated system, a broad size distribution will appear between the monomer and dimer when the protein concentration is close to the K d (27) . Thus, SARS-CoV Mpro acts as a rapid monomer-dimer self-association equilibrium system. Furthermore, we also measured the size distribution of R298A at various substrate concentrations. The results clearly indicated that the distance of major species shifting was related to the substrate dosage (Fig. 4 A) . More substrates resulted in more of the dimer form and the major species became closer and closer to the dimer. The trend was a linear positive correlation (Fig. 4 B) . Therefore, we conclude that the presence of substrate can induce a quaternary structural change in the R298A/L mutants. The system described in this article prevents any further monomer-dimer equilibrium analysis of the broad size distribution among the monomer and dimer species. We therefore performed the next set of experiments to further delineate the monomer-dimer equilibrium.",

In addition, SE experiments were executed. The three SV and one SE datasets were then globally fitted to the monomer-dimer self-association model by SEDPHAT to estimate the K d and k off . The best-fit results are shown in Table 2 . The k off values for wild-type Mpro and its three mutants were all close to 0.1 s \u00c01 , which indicates that the monomer-dimer exchange is instantaneous (27) . The K d values of wild-type Mpro without and with substrates were 2.0 and 1.7 mM, respectively, when those for the R298A/ Q299A double mutant were 85 and 115 mM. Not surprisingly, the K d of the R298A/L mutants was dramatically decreased, by 12-to 17-fold, in the presence of substrate, approaching the values for the wild-type ( Table 2 ). The K d rescued by substrates suggested that the R298A/L mutants display a protein association comparable to that of the wild-type in the presence of substrates. On the other hand, by nonlinear dependence fitting, the K d of wild-type in the presence of substrates is 2.5-fold lower than in the absence of substrates ( Table 2 ). The influence of substrates on the dimerization of wild-type is minor because of the stronger association between its protomers. In contrast, the R298A/Q299A double mutant lost two important ion pairs (Ser-123 (A)$$$Arg-298 (B) and Ser-139 (A)$$$Gln-299 (B)) in the dimer interface (18) and results in complete dissociation, even in the presence of substrates.

The results showed that after removing the substrate, wild-type Mpro still maintained a dimeric form, but the three mutants were all monomeric. This suggests that substrate-induced dimerization is a reversible process. When the substrate leaves, the R298A/L dimers dissociate back to being a monomer. A similar result was obtained when the substrates were removed by the HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and then analyzed by AUC (Fig. S3) .

In the ITC experiments, 1 mM TQ6-pNA was injected into the protein solution and curve fitting based on a 1:1 binding model was carried out (Fig. 6) . Compared with wild-type Mpro (Fig. 6 A) , all three mutants (Fig. 6 , B-D) exhibited a similar N and K d . The N values are close to 1, which means that one substrate may bind one enzyme molecule. The K d of substrate to wild-type Mpro was 34 mM, whereas those of substrate to R298A, R298L, and R298A/Q299A mutants were 81, 114, and 30 mM, respectively. However, the DH values for substrate binding to Mpro mutants were decreased by three-to sixfold compared with substrate binding to wild-type. Although this might be an artifact, because the enzymatic hydrolysis during the titration might produce additional heat that will contribute to the overall DH, the DH, N, and K d values from our ITC observations still suggest that the wild-type Mpro and its mutants, especially the monomeric R298A/Q299A mutant, have comparable substrate-binding affinities.",

            "text": "To obtain direct evidence for the role of Glu-166, we mutated and purified E166A and E166A/R298A mutants and then performed the kinetic and quaternary structure analyses. The E166A single mutant had an~3-fold loss in enzyme activity based on k cat /K m (Table 1) , whereas the enzyme activity of the E166A/R298A double mutant was not detectable. Furthermore, the experimental data from ITC for the E166A point mutant and the E166A/R298A double mutant suggest that these two mutants have comparable substrate binding affinities (Fig. S4 ). This indicates that without Glu-166, the substrate can still bind to the active site. On the other hand, the SV experiments suggest that E166A is a dimer with or without substrates (Fig. 7 A) . Furthermore, the K d of E166A was 3.7 mM and decreased to 0.4 mM in the presence of substrates, which was very close to the K d for wild-type (Table 2) . It is reasonable in that Glu-166 (A)$$$Ser-1 (B) is not the main force stabilizing the dimer interface. However, when Glu-166 and Arg-298 were both mutated, the dimerization was not detected, and the K d did not decrease in the presence of substrates (Fig. 7 B and Table 2 ). The results suggest that mutation of Glu-166 in R298A mutant will block the substrateinduced dimerization. This demonstrates that Glu-166 plays a pivotal role in connecting the substrate binding site with the dimer interface. The highly conserved Glu-166 in most CoVs, including SARS CoV, MHV, TGEV, HCoV, and IBV (8) , implies that involvement of this residue in the protomeric communication may be universal in all virion Mpro.

The wild-type is a dimer, as shown in our AUC studies, but we are not very sure about the quaternary structure of Mpro under the highly diluted assay conditions (<1.4 mM). We assume that there is a rapid equilibrium between the monomer and dimer in solution. Mutation at Arg-298 will push the equilibrium to monomer. There is also a rapid equilibrium between the active and inactive protomers. Substrate binding to the protomer (either a monomer or a dimer) induces a conformational change of the enzyme that shifts the equilibrium from monomers to the catalytic-competent dimers. The protein-concentration-dependent enzyme activity experiment indicated that only the dimer is enzymatically active. Arg-298 and Gln-299 are involved in this rate-limiting step for Mpro catalysis. When both residues are mutated, there will be no substrate-induced dimerization. On the other hand, Glu-166 is critical in the following subunit association step, which pushes the equilibrium to the catalytic-competent dimer formation. Then catalysis and release of products, followed by dissociation and regeneration of the inactive protomer, complete the catalytic cycle. This mechanism is also compatible with many current and previous studies (18, 21, 33, 34) .",
