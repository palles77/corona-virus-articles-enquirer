            "text": "Thermodynamic parameters a b s t r a c t A study of the binding of niclosamide (NC) to serum proteins such as human serum albumin, hemoglobin, and globulin was carried out using fluorescence and UV-visible spectroscopy. Interactions between NC and these proteins were estimated by Stern eVolmer and van't Hoff equations. The binding constants and the thermodynamic parameters, DH, DS, and DG at different temperatures were also determined by using these equations. Data showed that NC may exhibit a static quenching mechanism with all proteins. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated. Data showed that van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds are the main forces for human serum albumin and hemoglobin. Globulin, however, bound to NC via hydrophobic interaction. The spectral changes of synchronous fluorescence suggested that both the microenvironment of NC and the conformation of the proteins changed in relation to their concentrations during NC's binding.",

            "text": "Niclosamide (5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzamide; Fig. 1 .) belongs to the family of medicines called anthelmintic drugs, which are effective against most tapeworms [1, 2] . Its action against tapeworm species is to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation, block glucose uptake, and inhibit respiration in anaerobic ATP production [3, 4] . Niclosamide is a US Food and Drug Administration approved compound that has been used in humans for 40 years [5] . It is commercially known as Bayer 73 in Germany or bayluscide or niclocide in Canada and the United States [6, 7] . It is well tolerated by rats with an acute oral toxicity. A significant decrease in hemoglobin concentration occurs when niclosamide is given to male and female rats at a concentration of 5 g/ kg/day for four weeks [6e8] . Niclosamide is effective against severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [9] . It also has antineoplastic activity and anti-anthrax toxin properties [10, 11] . Niclosamide induces LC3-positive autophagosomes and inhibits the Wnt/Frizzled pathway and mTOR signaling [12e14]. Niclosamide's interaction with proteins and enzymes explains its mechanism of action in the human body. Thermodynamic parameters are especially helpful in identifying the binding mechanism of a drug to any protein. Serum proteins are the major transport protein in human body. Albumin is a serum protein widely used to explain the binding mechanism of a small molecule to a protein. Serum proteins are capable of reversibly binding many endogenous and exogenous drugs [15, 16] . They may aid in selective delivery of the drugs to a target tissue, organ, or tumor region, thus delivering drugs into the cell. Most recently, a large number of studies on the drugeprotein interaction have been reported using techniques including fluorescence, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichoism spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance [17e21]. It is necessary to determine binding parameters during destabilization by these methods for drugeprotein systems.",

When Dl is set at 60 nm, the synchronous fluorescence spectrum has the characteristic peak of the tryptophan residues [22] . When set at 15 nm, the characteristic peak of tyrosine residues in proteins appears. The polarity changes of the surrounding environment depend on the shift of the maximum emission. Blue shift of the fluorescence spectrum indicates that the polarity decreases and the hydrophobicity increases for the protein molecule [23] . The spectral changes of all proteins on synchronous fluorescence upon the addition of niclosamide are shown in Fig. 3 . The maximum emission peaks of tyrosine residues (Dl \u00bc 15 nm) and tryptophan residues (Dl \u00bc 60 nm) exhibited a slight shift for all proteins. As Fig. 4A and C shows, however, it is obvious that the pitch of quenching at Dl 60 nm is higher than that at Dl 15 nm for HSA and globulin, indicating that niclosamide is closer to tryptophan residues than tyrosine residues. This means that the binding sites of the drug are more prevalent on the tryptophan moiety. For hemoglobin, at a low concentration of the drug the pitch of quenching at Dl 15 nm is higher than that at Dl 60 nm, whereas it is lower than that of Dl 60 nm at a high concentration of niclosamide (Fig. 4B) . These results suggest that the polarity of the surrounding environment depends on the concentration of the drug. Both the tyrosine and tryptophan moieties exert an effect on the binding mechanism of hemoglobin.",

The binding of niclosamide to HSA is carried out by both van der Waals interaction and hydrogen bonding, which involve negative values of DH and DS.

            "text": "of proteins with niclosamide was carried out in Tris-HCl aqueous solution (pH 7.4). The fluorescence intensity of HSA was enhanced and the emission band slightly blue shifted as a result of increasing protein concentration at a certain amount of niclosamide. This suggests that the polarity of the microenvironment of niclosamide decreased, which means that niclosamide entered the hydrophobic microenvironment of HSA. A good linear response of fluorescence intensity was also obtained as a function of HSA concentration. The linear equation was y \u00bc 707.06x \u00fe 18.233 (R \u00bc 0.992) for HSA whereas the concentration of HSA ranged from 17.5 mg to 2.5 mg. Niclosamide also enhanced the emission band with a slight blue shift when the amounts of hemoglobin and globulin were increased. This means that the polarity of the microenvironment of niclosamide also increased for both proteins. The results suggest that niclosamide interacted with the hydrophobic sides of the proteins. The interaction of niclosamide with both hemoglobin and globulin thus occurred. The linear equation was y \u00bc 96.649x \u00fe 47.381 (R \u00bc 0.995) for hemoglobin",
