Community-acquired pneumonia was defined as suspicion of acute respiratory tract infection with a new or progressive infiltrate on a chest radiograph and one of the following criteria: fever (temperature \u202138AE0\u00b0C) or hypothermia (temperature <35\u00b0C), new cough with or without sputum production, abnormal percussion and altered breath sounds on auscultation, dyspnoea or tachypnea or hypoxia, and leucocytosis or leucopenia.",

Real-time PCR procedures were performed as described in reference [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Briefly, nucleic acids were extracted from the throat swabs with the MagNa pure LC using the total nucleic acid isolation kit system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Each sample was eluted in 1000 ll of buffer sufficient to perform all the real-time PCRs. cDNA was synthesized by using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (RT) and random hexamers (both from Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The reaction was performed in 100 ll of reaction mixture consisting of 10 ll RT-buffer (10\u00b7), 22 ll MgCl 2 (25 mm), 20 ll dNTP-mix (10 mm), 5 ll random hexameer (50 lm), 2,5 ll Multi-Scribe RT (50 U \u2044 ll), 2 ll Rnase inhibitor (20 U \u2044 ll) (EZ RT-PCR kit; Applied Biosystems) and 40 ll of the isolated sample. After incubation for 10 minutes at 25\u00b0C, RT was carried out for 30 minutes at 48\u00b0C, followed by RT inactivation for 5 minutes at 95\u00b0C.",

In spite of using sputum samples, blood cultures, urine for antigen assays, throat swabs and serum samples, no causative agent was found in 35% of the subjects. This is in line with the literature, where levels of identification of the causa-tive micro-organisms in CAP vary from 46% to 83%. This variation is attributable to differences in detection techniques and in selection of patients who are included. We improved the yield by testing sputum samples for S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci and L. pneumophila. We identified S. pneumoniae (22AE8%) as the most common single organism in 263 patients, followed by Coxiella burnetii (6AE8%) and influenza A virus (3AE8%). This was similar to other studies, which also reported S. pneumoniae as a predominant causative agent. 1 On the other hand, we did not find many Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections in our study, even though in the literature M. pneumoniae is among the most common 'atypical' pathogens. This might be due to the fact that M. pneumoniae infections occur in cyclic epidemics every 3-5 years and infections are generally mild. Many adult cases may be asymptomatic and not in need of medical attention. 25 In the Netherlands, CAP affects about 5-10 persons per 1000 inhabitants, and only 5-20% of these cases are admitted to hospitals. Furthermore, the distribution of pathogens causing CAP may vary by country, owing to geographic differences. In our study, Chlamydophila pneumoniae was detected in throat samples of two patients only. Some studies indicated C. pneumoniae as one of the most common 'atypical' pathogens. However, a recent study by Wellinghausen et al., 29 found a low prevalence (<1%) of C. pneumonia which is in accordance with our findings. It is unclear what the reasons are for these different detection rates.",

Another limitation was the incomplete sputum sample collection. The reason was the inability of patients to produce sputum. Therefore, throat swabs were taken of all patients. As the sensitivity of throat swabs may be lower than the sensitivity of sputum, nasopharyngeal sampling or washings, it is possible that we underestimated the prevalence of viruses in our population.",

In our study, viral and bacterial pathogens were found in 65 (16%) patients. Co-infection rates have been described in 5AE7-22AE5% of CAP in other studies.

Several studies found that during antibiotic treatment sputum samples became rapidly negative for S. pneumoniae in contrast to the S. pneumoniae PCR that remained positive. In our study, S. pneumoniae was detected in all culture-positive sputum samples and in many culture-negative sputum samples by PCR, presumably reflecting the increased sensitivity of molecular technique above traditional culture methods. Of the 60 patients with S. pneumoniae as causative organism, the pneumococcal antigen assay was positive in 62%. The results of the pneumococcal antigen assay showed a lower sensitivity compared with data reported by others. 42 The reason for this difference in sensitivity is unclear but could be explained by the influence of prior antibiotic therapy, not concentrating the urine before executing the assay, and the fact that the pneumococcal antigen assay is more sensitive in patients who are bacteraemic than in patients without a bacteraemia.",
