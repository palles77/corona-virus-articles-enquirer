            "text": "Live vaccines can generate false-positive results on common influenza assays including reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), culture and antigen tests. This threatens the integrity of epidemiological data and may misdirect treatment and control efforts. We report the development of RT-PCR tests that distinguish live FluMist TM vaccine (FMV) strains from circulating influenza strains in clinical samples. Primers were validated using influenza-positive samples from unvaccinated patients, packaged FMV, and one PCR-positive asymptomatic vaccine. Furthermore, the assay was used to experimentally test our lab's collection of influenza-positive samples from the 2004-05 and 2005-06 influenza seasons and several 2005 preseason isolates to determine the rate of vaccine-derived false-positive results under differing epidemiological conditions. Analytical and clinical validations show that the assay is both sensitive and specific. Experimental results demonstrate that 51 out of 51 influenza-positive samples collected during influenza season from ill, previouslyvaccinated military personnel represent real infections with circulating strains. Finally, the assay shows that four preseason influenzapositive samples were false positives resulting from vaccine shedding. The vaccine-discriminatory RT-PCR methods described here provide the first test designed to distinguish FMV strains from circulating strains. The results show that the test is effective, and demonstrate the importance of such tests in the age of live vaccines. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

            "text": "The FMV is a live, attenuated, cold-adapted, trivalent influenza vaccine that is administered intranasally. It contains three influenza strains: B, A/H3N2 and A/ H1N1. Each strain is a 6/2 reassortant in which the two genomic segments encoding the primary surface antigens, hemaggluttinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), are derived from antigenically relevant wild-type strains [1] . The products of these genes confer the ability to induce protective immunity against currently circulating influenzas [2] and are taken from isolates that are recommended annually for inclusion in vaccine formulations. The remaining six genomic segments are derived from master donor virus (MDV) strains which are themselves derived from the A/Ann Arbor/6/60 and B/Ann Arbor/1/66 strains, originally isolated in 1960 and 1966, respectively. The original isolates were evolved by serial passage at sequentially lower temperatures to confer the temperaturesensitive, cold-adapted, and attenuated phenotype [3] . Previous studies have shown that live vaccine strains can be recovered from vaccinated individuals for up to 21 days post-vaccination and could therefore yield false influenza-positive results on RT-PCR tests, rapid antigen assays and culture-based diagnostics [4, 5] . In one study, shedding was demonstrated in 50% of the vaccinated subjects 3 days post-vaccination, and in approximately 5% seven days post-vaccination [5] . Given that our study population (military recruits) is highly vaccinated and our samples are generally collected during training within approximately 10 weeks of vaccination, the risk of generating false-positive influenza results due to FMV shedding is significant.",

The Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) laboratory uses RT-PCR as the principal diagnostic method for detecting influenza A and B in clinical samples. The universal influenza primers used by NHRC (sets 1, 2 and 7 in Table 1 ) and many of the primers described in the literature [7] target conserved regions in the matrix gene and are incapable of discriminating between the MDVs and current circulating strains. To ensure that influenza-positive samples identified by routine influenza A and influenza B RT-PCR assays are community-acquired infections and not the result of shedding from recent vaccination, primers were developed that can discriminate between the MDVs and currently circulating influenza strains.",

            "text": "Within H/N subtypes, the molecular evolution of the matrix gene follows a pattern of serial replacement in which new variant alleles arise from recently circulating alleles. Hence, their change is characterized by the accumulation of mutations (drift) over time, forming a linear phylogenetic succession [8] . With this evolutionary pattern in mind, strain-specific discriminating primers were designed for the three MDVs and for circulating strains of the three dominant influenza A subtypes (H3N2, H1N1, and H1N2) and influenza B. Each set of primers exploits polymorphisms that arose in specific subtype lineages after the isolation of the relevant vaccine strain. Fig. 1 alignment that illustrates the general pattern of influenza evolution, using the influenza A H3N2 matrix gene and the FMV_A (not H3N2) forward primer as an example. Phylogenetically, the matrix gene of the influenza A MDV (an H2N2 strain) lies directly between the currently circulating H1N1 and H3N2 clades (current H1N2 strains are very close to H3N2 strains with respect to the matrix gene). This pattern represents the fact that current H1N1 and H3N2 matrix genes have diverged independently from the MDV sequence, and hence differ from the MDV in different ways. Thus, a single pair of PCR tests cannot differentiate between the entire spectrum of circulating strains of influenza A and the FMV influenza A MDV. The FMV_A (not H3N2) primers can distinguish the influenza A MDV from circulating H3N2 strains, but will also give a positive result for circulating H1N1 strains (all primers are shown in Table 1 ). The Circ_H1N1 (not vaccine) primers, designed to yield a positive result for all current H1N1 strains, will not give a positive result for the MDV but will yield a positive result for some circulating H3N2 strains. Hence, a definitive identification of the influenza A MDV requires three results: a positive with the FMV_A primer set, and negative results with both the Circ_H3N2 and Circ_H1N1 primer sets. An analysis matrix is presented in Table 2 for clarity. There are no such issues with influenza B typing because all currently circulating influenza Bs are in the same distinct clade with respect to the influenza B MDV.",

If the pathogen has already been identified as influenza A, a paired test with the Circ_H3N2 primers and the FMV_A primers will usually definitively identify the strain as community-acquired by giving a positive result for the Circ_H3N2 primers only. However, if these tests yield a negative result with the Circ_H3N2 primers and a positive result with the FMV_A primers, then the Circ_H1N1 primers must be used to determine if the strain is vaccine or H1N1. These three PCRs should definitively discriminate between FMV shedding and circulating strains in 99% of influenza A cases (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/). Finally, rare H1N2 strains have also been identified in recent years, and some of these are slightly diverged from H3N2 at the Circ_H3N2 primer sites. Hence, we also present primers designed to catch these circulating strains.",

Supporting results include the four samples from FMV-vaccinated recruits who tested positive for both vaccine and circulating influenza A strains and the positive results from the control nasal swab sample of an author taken immediately after FMV vaccination. Most importantly, this fall our lab identified what appeared to be four very early-season influenza A infections at recruit training centers using our primary RT-PCR method, discoveries that would have been of epidemiological concern given the time of year. However, all four of these samples tested positive by FMV_A primers and negative by Circ_H3N2 and Circ_H1N1 primers (see Table 7 ), suggesting that the original FluA_Universal positive results were due to shedding of vaccine strains. This suggestion was substantiated by the facts that these recruits had been vaccinated Table 6 Negative controls used to assay specificity of vaccine discriminatory primers, shown as Species (# of strains tested) Human parainfluenza virus (6) Klebsiella pneumoniae (2) Staphylococcus aureus (2) Respiratory syncytial virus (4) with FMV within a few days of sampling and these samples did not yield culturable virus at 371C. The results show that influenza-positive RT-PCR results from surveillance of vaccinated populations during times when pathogenic influenza is not widely circulating are likely to be falsepositives from FMV strain shedding, strongly supporting the epidemiological and clinical necessity of tests that can discriminate between vaccine strains and circulating pathogenic strains. This is particularly critical at a time when public health agencies are increasing off-season influenza surveillance in an effort to protect the public from the threat of an influenza pandemic.",

In the past two vaccination seasons, MedImmune has sold between 450,000 and three million doses of the drug worldwide. The expected introduction of a refrigerator-stable version is likely to increase sales, as is increased public confidence and familiarity (FluMist was just introduced in the 2003/ 2004 influenza season, and is the first inhaled influenza vaccine).",

Vaccine-induced immunity to influenza A, on average, takes up to 14 days to confer immunity. Hence, these results are consistent with the patients' history, and suggest that these patients were simultaneously infected with a community-acquired influenza A strain and shedding FMV influenza A. It is interesting to note that these infected patients shed detectable levels of the vaccine strain while none of the seven asymptomatic patients sampled within six days of FMV vaccination gave positive results for the vaccinespecific tests (these individuals are among the asymptomatic controls shown in Table 5 ). This raises the possibility that vaccine strain survival and/or replication is supported by coinfection with community-acquired strains.",
