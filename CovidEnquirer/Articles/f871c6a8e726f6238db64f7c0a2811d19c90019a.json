In addition, all complications and microbiologic data during the first year post-transplant were assessed to determine whether adenovirus infection was diagnosed clinically outside the study evaluation. Acute rejection (Grade \u05462) was diagnosed on the basis of a transbronchial biopsy that demonstrated characteristic perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates using criteria defined by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT). 16 In patients in whom a biopsy could not be performed, a clinical diagnosis of rejection was permitted (i.e., a deterioration in lung function with no other identifiable etiology that responded to high-dose corticosteroid therapy). Effects on pulmonary function in patients with adenovirus infection were determined based on measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ). An FEV 1 decline of \u03fe15% within 3 months of adenovirus infection was considered potentially significant and occurring within a time period in which virally triggered declines in graft function may be playing a role.

In all patients with symptoms, resolution occurred without use of anti-viral therapy or reduction of immunosuppression. Viral loads were generally low in these patients (range 86 to 346 copies/ml), and viremia was not sustained. However, this did represent true replicative infection rather than detection of latent virus, because only cell-free samples (i.e., plasma) were used for viral detection. Adenovirus viremia was not associated with any evidence of indirect effects on graft function or presence of acute rejection.",

For example, in a study of pediatric lung and heart-lung recipients, specimens (swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) were prospectively tested for respiratory viruses by culture, PCR and antigen detection. 12 In 16 patients adenovirus was identified in the transplanted lungs of 8 patients. Of these patients, 2 appeared to have donor-transmitted early fulminant adenovirus pneumonitis. Overall, adenovirus infection of the transplanted lung was significantly associated with graft loss, obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) and death due to respiratory failure. 12 In another study, biopsy and autopsy specimens were analyzed for adenovirus by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in 308 lung transplant recipients. 9 Adenovirus pneumonitis was identified in 4 patients (1.3%). All cases had severe necrotizing pneumonia and were fatal. Three of the 4 cases were in pediatric transplant recipients and all cases occurred within 45 days of transplant, suggesting either donor transmission or early acquisition/re-activation in the recipient. 9 Late fatal adenovirus pneumonitis occurring several years after the lung transplant has also been described. 10 The PCR assay we used had a sensitivity of 25 copies/ml. This would be expected to be significantly more sensitive than the culture or direct antibody staining methods commonly used for respiratory specimens. Also, we assessed blood samples as opposed to respiratory specimens. Both of these factors may have partially accounted for the higher rate of infection observed compared with other studies.",

However, our data suggest that, in adults, infections are very common and often asymptomatic or associated with mild self-limited symptoms. This discrepancy may be due to several factors. First, we assessed viremia rather than infection within the allograft. It may be that the two sites of infection behave very differently in terms of symptomatology and clinical consequences. Second, used active molecular surveillance techniques, which are more likely to pick up sub-clinical cases, as compared with symptom-based diagnostic evaluation. Third, we did not assess pediatric patients, who may be more likely to have newly acquired adenovirus in the absence of pre-existing immunity. Therefore, it should be emphasized that, although no significant clinical effects of low-level viremia were observed, patients with higher viral loads may well have more severe disease or an association with rejection.",

However, the possibility of newly acquired adenovirus due to exogenous exposure cannot be excluded. Our results are consistent with recently published molecular surveillance data in other organ transplant recipients. 13 In a study of 263 adult kidney (and kidneypancreas), liver and heart transplant recipients, who had testing of blood samples at regular intervals, the incidence of detectable viremia was 7.2%. In 58% of these patients viremia was asymptomatic, whereas in the remaining patients viremia was associated with self-limited respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. In that study, the investigators did not detect an association with subsequent allograft rejection. 13 Limitations of our study include the small sample size and the fixed testing intervals. For example, testing may not have necessarily been carried out at all time-points at which patients may have had compatible symptoms (e.g., respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms). It is therefore possible that the incidence of infection may have been even higher. No additional cases of adenovirus were clinically diagnosed other than the patients who were positive by our surveillance; however, specific PCR testing for adenovirus was not routinely performed for clinical purposes during the study period. Finally, this study was considered a sub-study, part of a CMV prophylaxis study, and so adenovirus surveillance was not the primary objective.",

No association with acute rejection episodes or with a decline in lung function was observed after infection.
