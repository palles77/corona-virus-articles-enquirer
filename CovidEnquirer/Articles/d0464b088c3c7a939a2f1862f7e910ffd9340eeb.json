            "text": "Purpose: Despite the availability of molecular methods, identification of the causative virus in children with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) has proven difficult as the same viruses are often detected in asymptomatic children. Methods: Multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect 15 common respiratory viruses in children under 15 years of age who were hospitalized with ARI between January 2013 and December 2015. Viral epidemiology and clinical profiles of single virus infections were evaluated. Results: Of 3,505 patients, viruses were identified in 2,424 (69.1%), with the assay revealing a single virus in 1,747 cases (49.8%). While major pathogens in single virus-positive cases differed according to age, human rhinovirus (hRV) was common in patients of all ages. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IF), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) were found to be seasonal pathogens, appearing from fall through winter and spring, whereas hRV and adenovirus (AdV) were detected in every season. Patients with ARIs caused by RSV and hRV were frequently afebrile and more commonly had wheezing compared with patients with other viral ARIs. Neutrophil-dominant inflammation was observed in ARIs caused by IF, AdV, and hRV, whereas lymphocyte-dominant inflammation was observed with RSV A, parainfluenza virus, and hMPV. Monocytosis was common with RSV and AdV, whereas eosinophilia was observed with hRV. Conclusion: In combination with viral identification, recognition of virus-specific clinical and laboratory patterns will expand our understanding of the epidemiology of viral ARIs and help us to establish more efficient therapeutic and preventive strategies.",

Recent development of the multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay makes noninvasive identification of respiratory pathogens possible. However, a more accurate diagnosis of causative ARI pathogens does not decrease hospital admissions or antibiotic use in children with ARI. 3) Since viruses are often detected in asymptomatic children, 4) identification of a virus by RT-PCR does not always imply that it is the culprit for a current ARI. Because these viruses are sometimes asymptomatic carriers and sometimes pathogens, a diagnosis should not be based solely on viral identification in respiratory samples. Moreover, new respiratory viruses have been increasingly recognized, but their clinical significance remains unclear. 5, 6) Thus, in addition to multiplex RT-PCR assays, Korean J Pediatr 2018;61 (6) :180-186 a better understanding of these viruses is required to improve clinical management.",

RSV, hRV, and PIV were the most prevalent single pathogens in patients younger than 3 years old. After the age of three, the prevalence of RSV decreased while the prevalence of IF and AdV increased, making hRV, IF, and AdV the most prevalent after three years of age. The younger age group shows higher virus positivity compared with the older age group, which may reflect prolonged shedding of respiratory viruses in young children. 10) Cases with multiple detected viruses are more likely to be males, while the sex ratio in single-virus cases is concordant with that of cases examined. The incidence of infectious disease is also reported higher among males. 11, 12) It is possible that after viral infection, viral clearance may be delayed in males, resulting in a greater chance for viruses to accumulate. The significance of multiple viral coinfections has been controversial. While it is unlikely to be associated with more severe illness, 9, 13, 14) specific pathogen pairs such as RSV with influenza virus may be associated with increased severity. 9) Studies report strong causal attribution of RSV, IF, and hMPV, less strong evidence for hRV and no attribution of AdV, hBV and hCV, [15] [16] [17] which is in agreement with the ratio of single to multiple detections of each virus in our study. Quantitative viral analysis may help to distinguish active infection from viral shedding in cases with multiple viral coinfection. 9) Because the clinical significance of multiple viral infections remains controversial and hard to interpret, we compared single-virus cases to understand characteristics of each virus. Seasonality of some respiratory viruses is an important clue for early recognition. In addition to the strong seasonal patterns observed with IF, RSV, and hMPV, it is interesting that RSV A and B have an apparent biennial seasonality. While hRV and AdV are prevalent throughout the year, seasonal patterns of viruses are discrete. Each respiratory viruses differ in seasonal onset as well as activity, but this can slightly vary from year to year. Knowing the seasonality of each virus will help to plan effective control strategies and to make epidemiological diagnosis. Analysis of virus-specific clinical profiles showed that cases of RSV A, RSV B, hBV, PIV, and hCV affect patients who are signifi cantly younger than those with IFA, IFB, AdV, and hEV ARIs. Premature birth history, and presence of congenital heart disease and chronic lung disease are not associated with any specific virus. While fever is a common symptom of ARI, cases of RSV and hRV are significantly afebrile. Infants younger than 6 months with RSV infection tend to be afebrile, which may be due to a lack of a pyrogenic cytokine response. 18, 19) While patients with afebrile RSV cases are significantly younger than febrile RSV cases (2.6 months vs. 11.4 months, P= 0.000 for RSV A, 4.9 months vs. 13.9 months, P=0.002 for RSV B), there is no age difference between afebrile and febrile hRV cases (23.8 months vs. 25.8 months, P=0.614) in this study, suggesting that pyrogenic immune responses might be different depending on the virus. Some viral respiratory infections are associated with asthma and asthma exacerbation. 20) Cases of RSV and hRV ARI present more commonly with wheezing, but eosi nophilia and a diagnosis of asthma exacerbation are associated only with hRV infection in this study. A study performed in children with acute wheezing illness reports that RSV is the predominant virus in patients with no previous wheezing, whereas hRV is predominant in patients with a history of wheezing. 21) Whether RSV infection causes asthma is still debatable, but it is possible that lower ARI with pathogens such as hRV and RSV could precipitate the development of asthma, especially in children with atopic features. 22) The total leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte and monocyte counts, and specific associations between blood cells, especially the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio have been used as markers of inflammation and infection. 23, 24) Viral ARIs show leukocytosis rather than leukopenia and furthermore, this study shows that IF, hRV, hEV, and AdV are associated with neutrophil-dominant inflammation whereas RSV, PIV, and hMPV are associated with lymphocyte-dominant inflammation. Of note, monocytosis is observed with RSV A, RSV B, and AdV ARIs. Other inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels are not significantly increased in most viral ARIs except for AdV infection. Thus, AdV ARI present with neutrophildominant leukocytosis, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a high C-reactive protein level, which mimics the response to bacterial infections.",

In this study, antibiotics are used more often in cases of hMPV and AdV, and they are also used more when infection in young infants who are potentially immune-incompetent, manifests as a lower ARI. Concerns of bacterial superinfection often cause us to continue the use of antibiotics, even after identification of a viral pathogen. Application of a clinical rule without consideration of virus-specific clinical and laboratory characteristics may lead us to make a wrong decision. 25) This study has some limitations. Not all patients were examined for a bacterial etiology at presentation, and the use of antibiotics might affect bacterial detection. Thus, it is possible that this study overestimates the number of viral ARIs. Also, the RT-PCR assay used in this study did not quantify the viral load. It is still possible that even the single virus detected in a patient with a symptomatic ARI might not be the causative pathogen.",
