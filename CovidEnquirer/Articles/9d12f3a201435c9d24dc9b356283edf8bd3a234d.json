            "text": "Japanese encephalitis (JE) is neuroinflammation characterized by uncontrolled infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the central nervous system (CNS). We previously demonstrated exacerbation of JE following CD11c hi dendritic cell (DC) ablation in CD11c-DTR transgenic mice. Moreover, CD11c hi DC ablation led to abnormal differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes and enhanced permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in promoting the progression of JE. Here, we examined changes in lymphoid and myeloid-derived leukocyte subpopulations associated with pro-and anti-inflammation during JE progression. The analyses of this study focused on regulatory CD4 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs), IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells, and CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes. CD11c hi DC ablation resulted in the accumulation of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells in the CNS, thereby leading to lower ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells. This result was corroborated by the higher expression levels of IL-17 and RORgT in CD4 + T cells from the brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. In addition, CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed higher frequency and total number of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes, whereas CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes were detected with lower frequency and total number in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, CD11c hi DC ablation altered the phenotype and function of CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes, resulting in lower levels of activation marker and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-b) expression. Collectively, these results indicate that CD11c hi DC ablation caused an imbalance in CD4 + Th17/Treg cells and CD11b + Ly-6C hi /Ly-6C lo monocytes in the lymphoid tissue and CNS during JE progression. This imbalanced orchestration of pro-and anti-inflammatory leukocytes following CD11c hi DC ablation may contribute to the exacerbation of JE. [Immune Network 2017;17(3):192-200] ",

Among the neurotropic flaviviruses, JE virus (JEV) is considered the most serious because of its neurotropical impacts, higher fatality rate, and permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae (1) . The expanding geographical range of JEV and potential for outbreaks of JE in nonimmune populations demand an urgent effort to develop effective antiviral therapies or alternate strategies to limit the immunopathology of JE (2) . Indeed, considerable progress in immunopathological studies of JE has been made in both infected patients and murine models (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . JEV replicates in monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) as primary target cells (9) , and in these cells, the virus travels from the periphery to the central nervous system (CNS), where it causes neurological disorders (10) .",

The role of DCs in neuroinflammation caused by neurotropic viruses like JEV is not fully understood because of their complex multi-cellular interactions with innate-like NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages and functions in immune homeostasis and tolerization (15, 16) . However, CD11c-DTR transgenic (Tg) mice, which express the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) gene under the control of a cloned Itgax promoter and allow conditional DC depletion upon DT injection, have been a critical tool in the in vivo study of DC immunology (17) . Using this conditional DC depletion model, we previously demonstrated marked exacerbation of JE progression and abnormal differentiation of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes following CD11c hi DC ablation (18) . Moreover, CD11c hi DC ablation enhanced the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by affecting the regulation of tight junction and adhesion molecules during JE progression (19) .",

Here, we hypothesized that JE was exacerbated in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice through additional mechanisms such as abnormal infiltration and/or maturation of lymphoid and myeloid leukocytes related to pro-and anti-inflammatory processes. Since the roles and quantities of CNS-infiltrated CD4 + Th cell subsets, including IFN-g + Th1, IL-17 + Th17, and Foxp3 + Tregs, have been not defined, we decided to examine changes in CD4 + Th cell subsets in the spleens and brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice during JE progression. Interestingly, our data revealed that CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells in spleens at 5 dpi, but IFN-g + CD4 + Th1 cells showed no change in frequency (Fig. 1A) . The accumulation of IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells in spleens was more apparent in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice; CD11c hi DC-ablated mice contained fewer IFN-g + CD4 + Th1 cells in their spleens (Fig. 1B) .",

These data suggest that the altered balance of CD4 + Th cell subsets (IL-17 + Th17 and IFN-g + Th1 cells) and regulatory CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs may contribute to the exacerbation of JE in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. Furthermore, the frequency and total number of infiltrated IL-17 + Th17, IFN-g + Th1, and Foxp3 + Treg cells were determined in the CNS at 5 dpi. As expected, IL-17 + CD4 + Th17 cells were detected at higher levels in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice ( Fig. 1E and F) . However, CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed a higher frequency and absolute number of IFNg + CD4 + Th1 cells in the CNS, which contrasted with the results from the spleen. This discrepancy may be caused by CNS-infiltration of CD4 + Th1 cells from the spleen that is considered reservoir. Therefore, enhanced CNSinfiltration of Th17 and Th1 cells seems to contribute to the exacerbation of JE in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice. In support of this, vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed higher proportion of CNS-infiltrated CD4 + Foxp3 + Treg cells (both frequency and total number) than CD11c hi DCablated mice (Fig. 1G and H) . This imbalance in Th17 and regulatory Treg cells that infiltrated the CNS resulted in a higher ratio of Tregs to Th17 cells in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice, compared to that in CD11c hi DCablated mice (Fig. 1I) .",

This contrast in the accumulation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes in the spleens and brains of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice resulted in a markedly increased ratio of Ly-6C hi to Ly-6C lo monocytes (Fig. 3E) .

Thus, we examined the differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice during JE progression. Our data revealed that CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes from the spleens of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice expressed anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-b at lower levels, compared to those from CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 4A) . One interesting result was that splenic CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes from vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice showed higher levels of expression of some growth factors associated with the differentiation of monocytes and DCs, including G-CSF and Flt3-L. Furthermore, CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes in the spleens of CD11c hi DC-ablated mice showed lower levels of expression of activation markers, compared to those in vehicle-treated CD11c-DTR mice (Fig. 4B) . The frequency and absolute number of CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes in the brain during JE.

Furthermore, CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes likely differentiate into CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocytes and become tissue-resident macrophages at the late stage in inflammatory disease (15 ",

Thus, the ablation of CD11c hi DCs, which share precursors with cells in the monocyte-macrophage lineage, might affect the differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C hi and Ly-6C lo monocytes in inflamed tissues. Our previous study showed that CD11c hi DC ablation resulted in under-differentiated phenotypes of inflammatory CD11b + Ly-6C hi monocytes during JE progression(18). Similarly, the present results indicate additional regulation of CD11b + Ly-6C lo monocyte differentiation in response to CD11c hi DC ablation, resulting in decreased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-b) that limits excess inflammation. This inappropriate differentiation of CD11b + Ly-6C lo mono-cytes in CD11c hi DC-ablated mice may fail to regulate JE progression. Collectively, data in this study suggest that CD11c hi DC ablation induced an imbalance in IL-17 + Th17 and Foxp3 + Treg cells and abnormally differentiated CD11b + Ly-6C hi to Ly-6C lo monocytes during JE progression, thereby facilitating JE progression.This study was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean Government (MISP) (2015R1D1A3A01019213).
