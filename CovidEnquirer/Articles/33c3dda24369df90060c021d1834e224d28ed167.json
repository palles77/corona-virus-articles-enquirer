Application of advance proteomic techniques for the characterization of disease-specific proteins may provide information for the detection of potential infectious agents. In this report, two proteomics techniques, a two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and a one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and one-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS), were applied for investigating viral proteins from cultured cells inoculated with a clinical sample. The 2D-DIGE method identified five viral proteins of vaccinia virus that are only present in infected cells, these results are in agreement with findings determined by genome based methods. The GeLC-MS/MS method identified eight vaccinia virus proteins out of 428 proteins detected in the sample. These results demonstrate that proteomic techniques can be used effectively for the detection of infectious agents. Given that the methods are capable of applying to proteins without a prior knowledge of the pathogen present, proteomics has a potential of being developed as a molecular tool for pathogen discovery, and disease diagnosis of emerging infectious diseases and for bioterrorism defense.",

            "text": "Qualitative protein profiling of the complex and dynamic entities that constitute a proteome can be accomplished by multiple-dimensional gel electrophoresis, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and combinations of these techniques coupled with mass spectrometry (MS). In a gel-based approach, complex protein mixtures can be resolved effectively according to their isoelectric points and molecular weights by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-GE) (O'Farrell, 1975) . Sep-arated protein spots are then excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometry for identification. While 2D-GE is a separation technique used widely prior to MS analysis, two-or multi-dimensional liquid chromatographic techniques have been developed and used increasingly in analyzing complex protein mixtures. In a shotgun method termed multi-dimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) (Washburn et al., 2001) , protein mixtures are digested first into a pool of peptide mixtures without prior sample fractionation. Next, peptides are fractionated using two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC), which consists typically of a strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) as the first dimension and a reverse phase chromatography separation as a second dimension. Thousands of protein components in cell lysates or other complex systems can be characterized directly by this approach. In addition, the gel and LC based technologies can be combined such that one-dimensional PAGE gel electrophoresis is used to separate proteins, and nano-capillary LC-MS/MS analysis is used to analyze the peptides generated from these proteins after in-gel digestion (GeLC-MS/MS) (Wilm et al., 1996; Schirle et al., 2003) . This approach is becoming increasingly popular in the field of proteomics research due to its combination of the robust nature of SDS-PAGE and the resolving power of LC-MS/MS.",

            "text": "Another challenge in proteomics has been to identify the relative abundance of proteins between two or more samples, and a number of techniques have been developed for this purpose . 2D-GE was a classic method used extensively in the early date of proteomics. Relative abundance of proteins between two or more samples, or unique proteins present only in one sample, can be determined by comparing directly the intensity of distinct gel spots between two or more gels. With 2D-GE, however, gel-to-gel variation, location of spots and low dynamic range of standard colorimetric staining techniques, make it difficult to identify confidently differences in protein composition between samples. These limitations can be overcome by a twodimensional differential gel electrophoresis technique (2D-DIGE) (\u00dcnl\u00fc et al., 1997) developed recently. In this method, two sets of protein extracts are labeled with two distinct and spectrally resolvable fluorescent tags and the mixture of labeled proteins is then applied onto a single 2D-GE gel separation. Differentially expressed or sample-specific proteins are detected and analyzed based on the distinctive colored spots. Since both samples are run on the same gel, gel-to-gel variability does not confound the results. An added advantage is that the sensitivity as well as linearity in the amounts of protein detected can be increased by fluorescence labels. Besides gel based methods, other quantitative proteomics techniques used commonly include stable isotopic chemical labeling of peptides or proteins such as isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT) (Gygi et al., 1999) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) (Ross et al., 2004) , metabolic labeling such as stable-isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) (Ong et al., 2002) , enzyme-catalyzed 18 O incorporation (Yao et al., 2001) , and label-free spectra comparison (Chong et al., 2001) .",

For instance, the protein components of intracellular mature virions (IMV) from vaccinia virus have been investigated using various proteomics approaches and up to 80 viral proteins were identified (Chung et al., 2006; Yoder et al., 2006; Resch et al., 2007) .

In this report, proteomic techniques for the detection and characterization of infectious agents were applied to complement methods that detect antibody responses, antigens, or nucleic acids associated with the pathogen. As a proof of concept, a cell culture was inoculated with an unknown infectious patient's sample (Anonymous, 2007) and was examined using two proteomics methods, 2D-DIGE and GeLC-MS/MS. The comparative 2D-DIGE method led to the direct identification of five vaccinia virus-encoded proteins in infected cells, but not in uninfected control cells. This is consistent with the finding of the vaccinia virus by a deoxyribonuclease sequence-independent single primer amplification (DNase-SISPA) sequencing method (Anonymous, 2007) . In addition, high sequence coverage of the viral protein E3 provides information to determine the specific vaccinia virus strain. These results suggest that proteomic techniques could be used as a potential powerful molecular tool for pathogen discovery and diagnostic, particularly important with the emergence of infectious diseases and the bioterrorism threat.",

In the search of the NCBInr database, one set of peptides could match to one or more proteins, including isomers that share the sequences of identified peptides. The mass spectra data sets of the spots 4, 5, and 8 resulted in three viral proteins (glutaredoxin-1, -2 and 14 kDa fusion protein) that could be from either vaccinia virus or other poxvirus species because the sequences of these virus-encoded proteins are either highly conserved or the virusor strain-specific regions were not included in the identified peptides (data not shown). In contrast, the data of spots 1 and 2 were found to be vaccinia virus-encoded protein E3 and B2. Fig. 4 shows the alignment of protein E3s among all poxvirus and strains where identical sequences were grouped into one row. As indicated by underlined amino acids, the peptides detected in the Fig. 3 . A typical MS/MS spectrum of a peptide detected from the digested protein in spot 1 as shown in the Fig. 2 . y-type ions represent the C-terminal fragments of the peptide whereas b-and a-type ions designate N-terminal fragments (Roepstorff and Fohlman, 1984) . regions of E3 had almost all of the amino acid variations suggestive of the Copenhagen strain (VAVC COP E3L). However, a minor difference in the E3 sequences between the Copenhagen strain and the other two strains in the group of VACV ACAM2000 was noted during manual inspection. Their protein sequences are almost identical except a swap of the alanine and valine at the position 83 and 89. The peptide at m/z 938.08 was identified as VAVC COP E3L peptide 66-96 (WFMTTEADKPDADAMADVIIDDVSR), by MASCOT database searching, that included the amino acid residues at these two positions. However, the sequence of this peptide was further determined to be derived from VAVC ACAM2000 encoded protein E3 by mass spectrometric analysis of two synthetic peptides (Fig. 5) . The tandem mass spectrum of the peptide digested from the gel spot matches the spectrum of the synthetic peptide derived from the protein of VACV ACAM2000 rather than the one of Copenhagen strain. Therefore, the strain-specific identification of the infectious pathogen can be narrowed down confidently to two vaccinia virus strains, VACV ACAM2000 (AY313847) and VACV MVA (U94848), included in the VACV ACAM2000 group (Fig. 4) .",

Spot 1 on the 2D-DIGE gel was located in a similar position to the viral protein spot seen by the regular 2-DE gel. Both spots were determined to be protein E3, indicating the consistency of the two methods. The reason that E3 was the only viral protein detected in the conventional 2-DE method could be due to its high abundance revealed by the high score and high sequence coverage of this protein (Table 1) .

The identification of the tryptic peptide at m/z 938.08 as a Copenhagen strain peptide, VAVC COP E3L peptide 66-96 , by MASCOT database searching could be problematic and needs further confirmation. The swap of the two amino acid residues within a single peptide does not alter its molecular weight and may not cause a significant change on its fragmentation pattern which is used to determine peptide sequence. The tandem mass spectrum of this precursor ion and the computer assisted sequence assignment was shown in Fig. 5A . Although the majority of experimental fragments match to the different types of ion fragments cleaved theoretically from the assigned sequence, three large fragments at m/z 888.49, 1003.47 and 1074.56, could not be assigned to the putative sequence. In addition, no fragments were observed to cover the region (AMADV) containing those two amino acids that are involved in residue swapping. An effective way to validate the sequence determination of a tryptic peptide is to prepare and analyze a synthetic peptide with the same amino acid sequence as the putative one. Synthetic and tryptic peptides should yield a very similar MS fragmentation pattern if they have identical composition and sequence. For this purpose, two synthetic peptides were prepared, with the sequences derived from the positions 66-96 of two E3 proteins. MS analysis of the synthetic peptides indicated that the three unassigned fragments in Fig. 5A appear on the spectrum of the synthetic VAVC ACAM2000 peptide (Fig. 5B) but not on the other (Fig. 5C ) while all other informative fragments of the tryptic peptide were also observed on this spectrum, indicating that the tryptic peptide was digested from VAVC ACAM2000 encoded protein E3.

Several of the peptides digested from E3 and detected by mass spectrometry resulted in significant MASCOT peptide scores, indi-cating their high ionization and fragmentation efficiency (data not shown). The combination of these critical criteria and advanced proteomics techniques, such as single-and multiple-reaction monitoring (SRM/MRM) methods (Kuhn et al., 2004) , should allow the development of high throughput screening method for direct and sensitive detection of infective virus.",

However, it is often inefficient in normal proteomic procedures to carry out a single enzymatic digestion prior to MS analysis. For example, a single trypsin digestion that cleaved proteins at the lysine and arginine sites usually produces some undetectable tryptic fragments of a small or large size, or low ionizable peptides and therefore only partial sequences of a protein can be determined. This limitation can be overcome by a multiple enzyme digestion strategy that has proved to be an effective way in identification of post-translational modifications on specific proteins . In this method, a sample can be divided into two or more fractions and each fraction can be digested with different endoproteinases. The multi-protease digestion generates overlapping peptides spanning over much broader regions of target proteins through cleavages at various residue-specific sites.",

            "text": "In this study, the effects of the multiple enzymatic digestions on the protein of the spot 1 from 2D-DIGE experiments (Fig. 2) were examined. In comparison to the single trypsin digestion, the combination of four individual digestions with different enzymes leads to more detectable peptides and hence to the increase in the sequence coverage of the target protein (Fig. 6 ). This should be particularly important for identifying strain-specific virus where the amino acid variation of a protein within the species is small, requiring high sequence coverage for a confident identification of the viral strain. It is interesting to observe that different sets of viral proteins, except protein E3, were determined by 2D-DIGE and GeLC-MS/MS methods. In addition, GeLC-MS/MS detected more virus encoded proteins than 2D-DIGE did whereas 2D-DIGE method yielded higher probability scores and the number of matched peptides for individual proteins than GeLC-MS/MS technique. These differences can be attributed to the two techniques of intrinsically different protein separation mechanisms and analysis strategies. In the 2D-DIGE method, only a few well-resolved and visualized protein spots were selected for further analysis whereas the other regions of interest are buried in poorly separated spots and could be ignored. In contrast, all proteins in selected gel bands were analyzed in GeLC-MS/MS method and identification depended on chromatographic separation, ionization and fragmentation efficiency of the in-gel generated peptides. Proteins isolated in 2D gel spots may not be detectable in a mixture present in a 1D gel band and vice versa. On the other hand, individual 2D-gel spots usually contain only one or a few purified proteins but more proteins can be present in the 1D-gel bands. Without additional separation steps, fewer peptides derived from gel spots than from gel bands could be expected and this could lead to a better separation and relative higher qualities of tandem mass spectra in a single LC-MS/MS run. Overall, both proteomics methods have their own advantages. 2D-DIGE produces straight forward images for the selection and characterization of potential candidates of interest. GeLC-MS/MS is a technically simple method that can resolve large and hydrophobic proteins typically not accessible via 2D gel electrophoresis. In addition, GeLC-MS/MS approach does not necessarily require control samples which could extend its application. ",

Up to 8 viral proteins were detected and the identification of protein E3 provides information also for the determination of the specific strain of vaccinia virus. The results are consistent with the data derived previously by genome based PCR techniques. In addition to genome-based PCR techniques used commonly for the detection and identification of infectious pathogens, proteomic methods may offer a useful alternative for pathogen discovery.
