            "text": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae; HC) has been long used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of inflammation diseases. Modern research has implicated inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as a key regulator of the inflammatory process. Aim of the study: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of HC on COX-2. We examined the effects of HC on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced prostaglandin (PG) E 2 production, an indirect indicator of COX-2 activity, and COX-2 gene and protein expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages. Materials and methods: LPS-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages were employed as an in vitro model system. LPS-induced PGE 2 production was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and COX-2 protein expression was assessed by Western blot assay. Results: The results showed that HC was able to inhibit the release of LPS-induced PGE 2 from mouse peritoneal macrophages (IC50 value: 44.8 g/mL). Moreover, the inhibitory activity of HC essential oil elicited a dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity (IC50 value: 30.9 g/mL). HC was also found to cause reduction in LPS-induced COX-2 mRNA and protein expression, but did not affect COX-1 expression. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and specific COX-2 inhibitor NS398 functioned similarly in LPS-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages. Conclusion: Taken together, our data suggest HC mediates inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity and can affect related gene and protein expression. HC works by a mechanism of action similar to that of NSAIDs. These results add a novel aspect to the biological profile of HC.",

            "text": "Inflammation is a natural host-defensive process in the innate immune response. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have proven to be significantly efficacious in the treatment of various disorders with an inflammatory component. NSAIDs function by binding to the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes to inhibit the production of prostaglandins from the substrate arachidonic acid. The prostaglandins that are otherwise normally produced by COXs have been implicated in a wide array of physiological events, including progression of inflammation, immunomodulation, and transmission of pain signals (Vane and Botting, 1998) . COX-1 is known to be constitutively expressed in mouse peritoneal macrophages and RAW264.7 cells, while COX-2 is overtly induced upon stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pre-inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (Mitchell et al., 1994; Guastadisegni et al., 2002; Simmons et al., 2004) . Induced inhibition of COX-1 in humans and animal models has resulted in undesirable side-effects, whereas COX-2 inhibition has generated therapeutic effects in management of pain, inflammation, cancer and neuropathologic conditions, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (Loren, 2002; Jachak, 2006; Blobaum and Marnett, 2007) .",

Selective inhibitors of COX-2, however, have been associated with a small but definite risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. The associated gastric damage of conventional NSAIDs and the recent withdrawal of selective COX-2 inhibitors from the market due to their adverse cardiovascular side-effects have generated a considerable impetus to develop alternative anti-inflammatory agents (Debabrata, 2002; Ortiz, 2004; Coruzzi et al., 2007) .

Mouse peritoneal macrophages are commonly used for in vitro COX assay due to the convenience of their preparation and harvesting (Lee et al., 1992) . Although several other cells are often present in the harvested peritoneal macrophage population, the undesired cells can be easily removed during subsequent washing steps since macrophages stick to the plate. In addition, in mouse peritoneal macrophages a sufficient amount of PGE 2 is produced by LPS through the COX-1 or COX-2 pathway (Simmons et al., 2004) . Prostaglandins play an important role in the inflammatory process (Hennebert et al., 2008) . Therefore, a quantitative analysis of the PGE 2 level in mouse peritoneal macrophages can be a good marker of anti-inflammatory activity produced by test substances.",

Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by direct interference with the cyclooxygenase enzymes is a common mechanism of NSAIDs. Since HC appeared to have actions similar to those of NSAIDs, we hypothesized that the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS398 might affect PGE 2 production and release in LPS-induced mouse peritoneal macrophages in a manner similar to HC. As shown in Fig. 1C , NS398 significantly inhibited endogenous PGE 2 production and release in mouse peritoneal macrophages exposed to LPS, similar to that observed in response to HC treatment. The decrease in PGE 2 levels after HC treatment corresponded with the decrease in COX-2 mRNA and protein expressions; however, NS398 also reduced mRNA COX-2 levels (Fig. 2B ) and COX-2 protein expression (( Fig. 2A) to similar extents as seen with HC. The results of this study partially reinforce the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory effects of HC are related with the inhibition of COX-2 activity, which is frequently enhanced during inflammatory processes (De Leval et al., 2002) .",
