            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a member of the Pneumovirinae subfamily in the Paramyxoviridae family, has been recently recognized as a leading cause of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in children, elderly subjects and in those with comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma or immunosuppression. [1] [2] [3] The most frequently used diagnostic methods for hMPV consist of a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay performed directly on clinical samples or isolation in cell culture followed by virus confirmation by RT-PCR. 1, [4] [5] [6] However, RT-PCR assays are not commercially available and viral growth is fastidious and restricted to a limited number of cell lines such as LLC-MK2 cells. Incubation times of 2-3 weeks are typically required before hMPV cytopathic effect is seen in cell culture. Recently, direct fluorescent antibody staining of respiratory cells in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) has been reported using monoclonal antibodies, 7-9 which offers a rapid alternative to molecular assays for hMPV detection.",

The hMPV EIA is an antigen capture assay for the qualitative detection of hMPV antigens in human respiratory specimens. The wells of the EIA plate were coated with a unique combination of monoclonal antibodies against the matrix and the fusion proteins of the virus. An extraction buffer was used to pre-treat samples before addition to the assay. Specific hMPV antigens, if present, bind to monoclonal antibodies coating the surface of the plate. A volume of 165 l of respiratory secretions (for duplicate testing) was tested. Following a wash step, peroxidase-labelled anti-hMPV monoclonal antibodies were added. The bound antigen-antibody complex was then detected by addition of tetramethylbenzidine substrate (TMB), which turns blue in the presence of peroxidase. A stable yellow end product was achieved by the addition of a stopping reagent. The total incubation time for the assay was 2 h and 15 min. The presence or absence of hMPV was determined in relation to a calculated cut off value (COV). The latter was determined by adding a constant value of 0.1 optical density 450 units (as determined by the manufacturer during assay development) to the mean negative control value in each assay. Data comparison between different assay runs was facilitated by using an index value (IV) whereby sample absorbance is expressed relative to the assay COV. An IV <0.9 or >1.1 indicated sample negativity or positivity, respectively. Equivocality was indicated when the IV was in the range 0.9-1.1 inclusive.",

Because of the unavailability of specimens for repeat testing, exclusion of samples with equivocal results would result in a more valid estimate of test performance. In that case, the hMPV EIA had a sensitivity of 81.1% (95% CI: 68.0-96.6%), a specificity of 100% Ten hMPV samples identified as positive by cell culture and RT-PCR were not detected by hMPV EIA. This discrepancy was probably not related to a lack of detection of a specific hMPV genotype since we identified both hMPV types (A and B) with the EIA (Table 1) . On the other hand, discrepant results correlated with viral load, and low viral load might limit detection by EIA. Thus, mean RT-PCR cycle threshold (C T ) values of 31.5, 34.7 and 39.1 were obtained for 5 selected EIA positive/RT-PCR positive samples, 5 EIA equivocal/RT-PCR positive samples and 10 EIA negative/RT-PCR positive samples, respectively (Table 1) .

RT-PCR has been considered the method of choice for hMPV detection due to the slow replication of this virus in very few cell lines 11 and, until recently, the unavailability of rapid antigenic detection methods. [7] [8] [9] However, \"in-house\" molecular methods require expensive laboratory equipment and carefully trained personnel. Despite its lower sensitivity compared to RT-PCR, the Biotrin hMPV EIA is a more rapid, less expensive and highly specific method for detection of hMPV in clinical samples that can be used in all microbiology laboratories. Importantly, the Biotrin hMPV EIA detected both major hMPV genotypes (A and B) from patients of different ages. One limitation of our study is the use of frozen NPA samples since cycles of freeze and thaw may lead to antigen degradation and potentially affect antigen detection; thus, we may have underestimated the true sensitivity of the EIA test. On the other hand, the frozen samples provided us with an opportunity to test different hMPV genotypes collected over several years. Another caveat is the generation of equivocal results with the EIA test, which implies the need for re-testing the same specimen with an alternative method, such as RT-PCR, or taking another sample for EIA testing (which was not feasible in our study). Additional prospective studies are needed for further evaluation of this assay using fresh respiratory samples and other types of specimens.",
