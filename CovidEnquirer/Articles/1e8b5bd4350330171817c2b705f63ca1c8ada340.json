Previous and current challenges that have been encountered over time function as a collective driver for design progression. However, such challenges have remained under research to be able to draw useful lessons from them. To understand how this established motif can suit the sustainability-conscious era, this study uses Hong Kong as a representative case for sub-tropical compact cities by critiquing its PH design against multiple constraints. The objective of this study is to trace the historical relationships between challenges and design progress as well as to assess current and future implications of sustainability trends on PH design. By synthesizing data from literature, policy documents, and empirical evidence, this research develops an evolution map for PH design in Hong Kong that is driven by seven major challenges. Based on this map, a conceptual framework for intersecting considerations that envisages five main future prospects toward future PH design is also established.",

The term for PH and its eligibility criteria may vary across regions, but the objective of providing affordable dwelling to those in need remains the same. Even when urban backdrops are markedly different nowadays, PH still represents a considerable portion of the overall housing provision in some Asian economies, i.e., 46.7% in Hong Kong (Census and Statistics Department (CSD) , 2013a) and over 80% in Singapore (Housing and Development Board (HDB), 2013). Mainland China comprises 25% of the global population, but affordable housing in this area only makes up approximately 10% of its total housing portfolio (Mok, 2013) . This situation explains the ambitious target of Mainland China, i.e., an output of 36 million units by 2015 (National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), 2011) .",

However, only a few studies have mentioned that an overarching concern should be expressed toward the needs of individuals at the bottom of the economic pyramid, given that poverty and inequity significantly increase the chance of environmental and other types of crisis (United Nations (UN), 1987) . Considering that environmental degradation, population growth, and poverty are inextricably bound, and each issue is impossible to address independently (UN, 1987) , PH provides a good opportunity to manage these issues holistically. However, the unique contribution of PH to realizing the vision of multi-spherical sustainability is frequently understated. Under the triple-pillar principle (UN, 1992) , sustainable PH implies adopting intergenerational social equality to approach economical accommodation within ecological carrying capacities. Following this logic, PH design should adapt to a sustainability challenge to balance budget consciousness, environmental enhancement, and social inclusiveness.",

As a major PH provider, the Hong Kong HA has been statutorily committed to develop, retrofit, and manage an increasing stock of PH estates since 1973. By March 2013, the 162 PRH estates of HA are accommodating over 2 million people (Long Term Housing Strategy Steering Committee (LTHSSC), 2013). To address the re-emergence of PH supply deficiency, the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region plans to provide approximately 179,000 PRH units within a 10-year time frame starting in 2013.

This study aims to synopsize the history and reality of PH design in Hong Kong, as well as to contribute a conceptual framework by outlining major considerations toward sustainable PH design, in general. The history and reality referred to in this paper are divided by the year 2003. The major reason for such division is the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which heightened awareness of PH design professionals and the society as a whole on the crucial relationships between occupant health and environmental degradation. Such relationships were previously considered insignificant in vertically compact high-rise living quarters, including PH estates in Hong Kong. The three objectives of this study are as follows:",

The large influxes of immigrants since the 1930s exacerbated this problem and resulted in a sprawling area of timber squatter huts across the forested hills. Such make-shift houses, which were constructed in the face of financial hardship, posed tremendous fire risk. On Christmas night in 1953, a huge fire destroyed a squatter camp and left 53,000 people homeless. This tragic event marked the beginning of PH development, which had not yet received political priority in any period in history. Government provision became the only means to address such massive housing shortage. In 1954, the fire victims were successfully settled in emergency housing units. On average, five adults shared an 11 m 2 unit. Cooking was carried out at the corridor outside the unit, whereas tap water and sanitary facilities were centralized. The ground floor was partly reserved for basic community facilities and partly as an open space for natural ventilation. This hallmark of stilt houses, which is ubiquitous in sub-tropical southern China, remains as a feature of current PH estates.",

Considering the persistent squatter problem and the steady increase in income of local residents, the local government announced its PH policies in 1964 to accelerate the provision of resettlement estates. By 1965, PH residents reached 1 million. Nevertheless, intermittent riots, which were partly triggered by the overcongestion problem in resettlement estates, erupted during the late 1960s Hence, formulating the first Ten-year Housing Program (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) became reasonable.

By the late 1960s, most developable lands on the Island and in Kowloon had been virtually used up. The pressing need to decentralize the increasing population in these overcrowded urban regions ushered in a new town development model to practically implement the Ten-year Housing Program by stages. This new development model, which mixed public and private housing developments, also offered an unprecedented opportunity for housing architects and urban planners to work together and create a new-generation PH prototype of the Twin Tower blocks. Apart from an increase in flat size and an optimized layout, these high-rise estates were equipped with self-contained social and recreational amenities and were modeled largely on the British planning philosophy of self-contained community development.",

Flat design optimization was carried out in various aspects, including the elimination of windowless rooms in each flat, the shortening of long and dark corridors, and allowing selfpartitioning by residents. As quality public spaces and amenities increasingly became a design focus in PH estates, landscape architects started to join the scene during the 1980s and later became fully involved in designing open spaces and outdoor recreational facilities with housing architects.",

Consequently, spatial standardization was no longer a panacea for optimizing development potentials. By contrast, rigid design formulas were under intense debate because of the negative effects of their proliferation, namely, monotonous streetscapes that sharply contrast with the internationally acclaimed harbor-front skylines, cookie-cutter estates with low individual community identities, and low flexibility in furniture and fit-out arrangements for residents. Some breakthroughs were gradually made during the 1990s to provide a variety of flat mixes. The standard design approach was finally superseded in 2000 by the non-standard approach under the new site-specific strategy.",

The outbreak also caused design professionals to rethink on how energy efficiency can be simultaneously satisfied with people-oriented issues in the advent of sustainable building designs. Promoting sustainable communities became an underlying factor of subsequent housing policies to boost the local economy, and consequently, stimulate a supply-side pursuit for value-added housing design to regain public confidence. Environmental sustainability has become a priority in designing new PRH estates and retrofitting existing housing stock with continuing efforts to green PH estates and their surroundings.

A contributing factor to this shift is the relentless effort to develop nine new towns as an effective decentralizing strategy to accommodate the continuously growing population over the last four decades. Among the nine new towns, seven are situated in the New Territories and one is located in Kowloon. By 2010, the nine new towns collectively accommodate approximately 3.3 million people, and the number is expected to rise to 3.5 million by 2017 (CEDD, 2012) . The significant concentration of PH population in the New Territories and in Kowloon indicates a high concentration of low-income population in these regions. Moreover, among the 271,000 PRH flats in 2013, 37.2% are 26 years old and beyond the block age (HA, 2013b). This figure, which presents a significant increase from the record of 12.5% in 2003, indicates aging and substandard housing stock amid accelerating environmental degradation. The increasing volume of unfit housing that requires retrofitting or replacement has a considerable influence on the urban regeneration process.",

To satisfy long-term requirements for housing and infrastructure, several land supply options, including rezoning land, redevelopment, land resumption, and reuse of ex-quarry sites, have been adopted (CEDD, 2012). Among other efforts to alleviate the reemerging shortage in PH is a 9.17 ha development that can provide 13,300 PRH flats (Legco, 2012) . With the theme \"homes in the park,\" this new project is part of the 320 ha Kai Tak development to transform the former airport region into an international hub for tourism, sports, housing, and business (CEDD, 2006 ). An unparalleled advantage of this mixed-use model lies in the shared network of transportation infrastructure and public amenities. However, initiating PH development at this scale is virtually impossible in the built-up inner city districts on the Island and in Kowloon, wherein numerous market-led land-use claims are competing. From the perspectives of economy and affordability, land price is sufficiently high to discourage any attempt to turn such prime locations into PH estates.",

On one hand, pencil development can boost PH production in every bit of renewable land in already intensified living quarters with spatial, geotechnical, environmental, and regulation constraints. On the other hand, the negative effects of weakening the existing vicinity by disregarding the need to upgrade or expand key infrastructure, public amenities, and transport networks in due course still need to be controled or curbed in such sporadic developments.

Although improving poor air quality has long been a focus of environmental improvement, health and social issues that are closely associated with environmental degradation remained low on the local policy agenda even after the SARS epidemic (Ng, 2012) . In 2010, the local government began aiming for a voluntary carbon intensity reduction of 50%-60% (from the 2005 level) by 2020 to position Hong Kong as a green exemplar of China (Environmental Protection Department (EPD), 2010). This program was followed by the launching of the first sustainable building assessment tool tailored for Hong Kong, i.e., the Building Environmental Assessment Method Plus (BEAM Plus). Given the sub-tropical climate and the predominantly high-rise built environment in Hong Kong, BEAM Plus considers a sustainable building to be safe, healthy, comfortable, functional, and efficient (Green Building Council (GBC), 2012). As of 2011, 15 PRH projects were assessed under BEAM Plus and 3 achieved platinum level (HA, 2012d).",

A site-specific and value-driven approach has been developed to optimize site potential, improve flat suitability, and enhance estate identity (Legco, 2009 ). Compiled from various sources (EPD, 2013; Fung, 2007 Fung, , 2010 -2002 HAHD, 2011) , Table 2 presents nine major types of PH design initiatives and innovations established since 2004 to achieve improved design quality. For example, fully adopting a flexible housing production mix model requires strong inputs in both design and technical aspects, which leads to reforms in procuring consultancy services. Since 2004, an independent consultancy mechanism has been positioned as part of the integrated feedback and knowledge management system, upon which the modular flat design can be revised and optimized (HA, 2007) . In 2012, the updated version of BEAM Plus introduced an alternative route to assess building energy by encouraging the passive design strategy (GBC, 2012) to achieve comprehensive efficiency in space and energy use as well as in construction and operation costs. In line with the sustainable building design guidelines promulgated in 2011 (BA, 2011), model client briefs and contract specifications were introduced to ensure that all new PH projects would be BEAM Plus-ready, with a minimum of gold rating for 2015/2016 onward (HA, 2013d). Aside from fostering industry-wide awareness in building sustainability, the granted extra gross floor area concession can be used to increase the number of dwelling units. This strategy is one of the latest approaches to address the undersupply of both land and housing.",

This phenomenon conveys another important message, i.e., although a crisis may short circuit some political procedures to catalyze a paradigmatic change, continuing to make progress for the sake of the users over time requires increased determination and additional systematic inputs regardless of how incremental the procedures have been.

This logic applies to any given economy, regardless of whether PH accounts for a small or large portion of the overall housing provision. ",
