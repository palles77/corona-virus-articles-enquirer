We used uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number R 0 to assess the role that model parameters play in outbreak control. The transmission rate and isolation effectiveness have the largest fractional effect on R 0 . We estimated the distribution of the reproductive number R 0 under perfect isolation conditions. The distribution lies in the interquartile range 0.19-1.08, with a median of 0.49. Even though the median of R 0 is <1, we found that 25% of our R 0 distribution lies at R 0 > 1, even with perfect isolation. This implies the need to simultaneously apply more than one method of control.",

A slightly different model was used to quantify the role that fast diagnosis and efficient isolation of patients played in Toronto's outbreak (10) . This model predicted control in Toronto and showed that lack of immediate action would have been catastrophic (11) . The model incorporates differences in the population's susceptibility (3) by dividing the population into classes S 1 (high risk) and S 2 (low risk). A low-risk group in the age range <19 years can be observed from the age-specific incidence in Hong Kong (3) . The low-risk class (S 2 ) has a reduced susceptibility to SARS, measured by the parameter p (0 < p < 1). While p = 0 denotes no susceptibility to SARS, p = 1 indicates that both susceptible classes are equally susceptible to SARS. Initially, S 1 = \u03c1N and S 2 = (1-\u03c1)N, where N is the total population size and \u03c1 is the initial proportion of fully susceptible (S 1 ) persons. Susceptible persons exposed to SARS enter the exposed class (assumed to be asymptomatic) with a rate proportional to \u03b2 and remain there for a mean incubation period of 1/k.

The systematic decline in R 0 with increasing l in the range [0,1] is illustrated in Figure 4 . Furthermore, our results do not change if we assume the three distributions mentioned in the Methods section (sensitivity analysis) for the parameter l. Table 3 shows the partial rank correlation coefficients for the other three possible distributions of l. The transmission rate is ranked first independent of the distribution of l. The relative infectiousness after isolation is ranked second when l comes from distributions (a) and (b) and ranked third when it comes from distribution (c) (see Methods). Our sensitivity analysis is corroborated by computing local derivatives on R 0 (see online Appendix at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/ EID/vol10no7/03-0647_app.htm). Because bounds exist on how much a given parameter can change in practice, achieving control (i.e., R 0 < 1) can require changing parameters other than those with the highest partial rank correlation coefficient. For example, reference 10 showed that control of the outbreak in Toronto relied on both a reduction in l and 1/\u03b1, even though \u03b1 is ranked fairly low by the partial rank correlation coefficient.",

Our estimates for R 0 agree with the empirical R 0 observed from the data of the first week of the SARS outbreak in Singapore (8) . A stretched exponential distribution fits the resulting distributions of R 0 for the different locations ( Figure 2) . Even though the median of R 0 is <1 when perfect patient isolation is assumed (l = 0), we find that 25% of our R 0 distribution lies at R 0 > 1. That is, implementing a single method for control may not be sufficient to contain a SARS outbreak. Control may require modifying more than one parameter amenable to intervention. In our model, these parameters include the diagnostic rate (\u03b1), the relative infectiousness after isolation has begun (l), and the per capita transmission rate (\u03b2). The fact that \u03b1 and l are not independent, but are tightly coupled, favors control.",

With the exception of a few measures, such as closing schools, no clear policies would modify \u03b2 directly. This means that a substantial effort must be (and has been) made by the medical community to modify other parameters, such as the diagnostic rate. Hence, the strong sensitivity of R 0 to the transmission rate \u03b2 indicates that efforts in finding intervention strategies that manage to systematically lower the contact rate of persons of all age groups promise an effective means for lowering R 0 . Such strategies may include using face masks (the probability of transmission per contact may be reduced), washing hands, and avoiding large crowds (large public events). Associated with the role of screening, diagnosis, and the effective isolation of patients is the issue of cost. We cannot ignore or minimize the value of stringent quarantine measures and the probability of compliance combined with the economic effect of lost wages (thousands were quarantined in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore [17] ), the costs associated with screening at airports and hospitals, the cost associated with closing hospitals; and the costs associated with isolating SARS patients and exposed persons (see online Appendix for a brief discussion).
