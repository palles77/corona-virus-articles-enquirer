New human pathogens often emerge or re-emerge from an animal reservoir, emphasizing the central role that nonhuman reservoirs play in human infectious diseases. Pathogens can also re-emerge with new characteristics, such as multidrug resistance, or in different places, such as Ebola virus in West Africa in 2013 and Zika virus in Brazil in 2015, to cause new epidemics. Most human pathogens have a history of evolution in which they first emerge and cause epidemics, become unstably adapted, re-emerge periodically and then e without intervention e eventually become endemic, with the potential for future outbreaks.",

            "text": "In the 1970s, with antibiotics and vaccines at hand and the eradication of smallpox within reach, there was a general optimism that infectious diseases would soon be a thing of the past. In 1972 the Nobel laureate Macfarlane Burnet concluded that: 'If . we retain a basic optimism and assume no major catastrophes occur and that any wars are kept at the 'brush fire' level, the most likely forecast about the future of infectious disease is that it will be very dull'. The pandemic of HIV crushed this optimism, and infectious diseases were put back on the global health agenda, of which the 1992 publication Emerging Infections: Microbial Threats to Health in the United States 1 has been a landmark. Since then, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among many different pathogens, including against last-resort antibiotics, the continuous emergence of (mostly) viruses with potential for human-to-human or pandemic spread, and the intentional release of pathogens as terrorist weapons are continuously reminding us that infectious diseases are actually far from dull.",

            "text": "'Emerging infectious diseases' are defined as 'those whose incidence in humans has increased within the past two decades or threatens to increase in the near future. Emergence can be from the spread of a new agent (including known agents with a new resistance mechanism), from recognition of an infection that has been present but undetected in the population, or from the realization that an established disease has an infectious origin. Emergence can also be used to describe the reappearance (or reemergence) of a known infection after a decline in incidence. 1 Zoonotic emergence Pathogen There are >1400 known human pathogens, most (60%) of which are transmitted to humans zoonotically and depend on an animal reservoir for survival. An additional smaller proportion (5e10%) is environmentally transmitted, and the remainder consists of pathogens that can be maintained by an exclusively human-to-human transmission cycle. Among emerging infections, the proportion of zoonotic infections is even higher (73%), indicating that the humaneanimal interface presents a risk for emergence. 2 In addition, almost all (now) established strictly human pathogens have zoonotic origins: 2,3 these pathogens have moved from animals into humans and fully adapted to them during many millennia of human and pathogen evolution.",

            "text": "Because most human pathogens rely on an animal or environmental reservoir, the interactions between human populations and their surrounding ecosystem determine the local pathogen spectrum, and the interpopulation interactions determine the spread of these pathogens. Historically, there have been several profound and distinct transitions in human environmental and interpopulation interactions that have radically changed the spectrum and causes of infectious disease in human populations (Table 1) . Today, we are living through the fourth great historical transition. The invasiveness of human activity into all geographical areas of the world, the globalization of economic activities and culture, the speed and accessibility of distant contact, the spread and intensification of urbanization, and our increasing reliance on either intricate or massive Key points C Infectious disease are continuously emerging C Most known human pathogens are zoonoses, and most that are not have zoonotic origins C Globalization and human invasiveness create more opportunities for emergence C Global surveillance and research consortia and novel technologies will allow for more frequent and more rapid detection of novel pathogens C A more proactive approach to mitigation of emergence events is required technology, are reshaping the relations between humans and microbes. 4 The species jump The jump between species that initiates a first human infection by a new agent is often brought about by a novel or unusual physical contact between potential pathogen and human. Such contacts usually occur because of cultural, social, behavioural or technological change on the part of humans that affects the humaneanimal interface. The potential for subsequent spread of this 'new' infectious disease depends on many different factors, including environmental or social factors. These changes and factors (Table 2 ) are the drivers of emergence. 1 Rather than being a single event, biologically the species jump is often more a transition process involving several stages ( Figure 1 ). The pathogen has to overcome various biological barriers (interspecies, intrahuman, interhuman) to move from one stage to the next, to be able finally to cause sustained human-to-human transmission. Based on data from 1940 onwards, the hotspots for emergence of infectious diseases were mapped for zoonotic infections from wildlife and domestic animals, and for drug-resistant and vector-borne organisms. Figure 2 shows that these hotspots are primarily located in South and South-East Asia, South and Central America and Sub-Saharan Africa. 5 Various international consortia and large research programmes have been established in an attempt to predict and prevent, or prepare for and mitigate, these novel emergence events. Technical advances enable us to detect, characterize and trace these agents much more rapidly than ever before. However, experience shows us that we have not been able to appropriately predict, anticipate or tackle emergences of unknown pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, known pathogens such as Ebola and Zika virus, or even the annual reappearance of H7N9 influenza in China. A more proactive approach, for example using platform technologies to develop libraries of vaccines and monoclonal agents that can be mass-produced when needed, is therefore warranted.",

There is a rapid and increasing spread of antimicrobial drug resistance among bacteria and other pathogens. Drug resistance is a threat to the successful treatment of not only HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, but also hospital-and community-acquired infections caused by 'normal' Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria; these have been predicted to have a major economic impact if not addressed. This has been recognized as a global public health emergency, requiring a global effort to raise awareness, implement regulation and develop novel antibiotics or alternative approaches to prevention and treatment.",

Global food production and distribution processes can give rise to widely disseminated foodborne infections that are hard to tackle, and to rapid spread of bacteria with novel resistance mechanisms. Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, although avian influenza viruses attract most international attention, hand, foot and mouth disease, caused by a fluid spectrum of non-polio enteroviruses, is associated with hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations of children <5 every year; this includes with neurological and cardiopulmonary complications and a mortality of around 0.1%, showing that humans can also be a source of emerging infections (Table 3) . Table 1 Biological, social and environmental drivers of emergence of infectious disease It is crucial that each patient's history should include a travel history, which involves more than asking for the countries the patient has visited. In the end, despite sophisticated surveillance programmes, it is usually an astute clinician who, after having seen or heard one or two extraordinary patient histories, makes the connection and sees the first signs of an event of emergence.
