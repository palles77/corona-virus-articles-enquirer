            "text": "Filoviruses cause severe and fatal viral hemorrhagic fever in humans. Filovirus research has been extensive since the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Due to their high pathogenicity and mortality, live filoviruses require Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) facilities, which have restricted the development of anti-filovirus vaccines and drugs. An HIV-based pseudovirus cell infection assay is widely used for viral entry studies in BSL-2 conditions. Here, we successfully constructed nine in vitro pseudo-filovirus models covering all filovirus genera and three in vivo pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models using Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and Lloviu virus as representative viruses. The pseudo-filovirus-infected mice showed visualizing bioluminescence in a dose-dependent manner. A bioluminescence peak in mice was reached on day 5 post-infection for Ebola virus and Marburg virus and on day 4 post-infection for Lloviu virus. Two known filovirus entry inhibitors, clomiphene and toremiphene, were used to validate the model. Collectively, our study shows that all genera of filoviruses can be well-pseudotyped and are infectious in vitro. The pseudo-filovirus-infection mouse models can be used for in vivo activity evaluation of anti-filovirus drugs. This sequential in vitro and in vivo evaluation system of filovirus entry inhibitors provides a secure and efficient platform for screening and assessing anti-filovirus agents in BSL-2 facilities.",

Both ebolaviruses and marburgviruses cause severe human disease, with mortality rates of 24%-90% 2,3 . Cuevavirus is found in bats, and whether it is infectious to humans remains unknown. Ebola virus (EBOV, species Zaire ebolavirus) is the most frequently erupting filovirus. It caused the 2013-2015 EBOV epidemic in West Africa, resulting in more than 28,000 suspected cases and 11,310 confirmed deaths 4 . The etiology of Ebola virus disease remains unclear, and new cases appeared in May 2017 5 . Although some vaccines and drugs under study have shown effects [6] [7] [8] , there are still no licensed anti-filovirus agents available. Filoviruses are select agents and listed as World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogens, for which live virus research requires BSL-4 facilities 9,10 , limiting the development of anti-filovirus vaccines and drugs.",

Because of its safety, pseudovirus based on an HIV-core (pNL4-3.Luc.R -E -) is a powerful model for highly pathogenic enveloped viral entry studies in vitro (filovirus, highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and etc.) [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The bioluminescence imaging assay is a visualizing tool that has been used for viral studies in animal models [16] [17] [18] . Although some Ebola virus-like particles used for vaccine studies in vivo have been reported [19] [20] [21] , to the best of our knowledge, there is no study on the comparative in vivo pharmacodynamics of filovirus entry inhibitors on different genera of filoviruses. In this study, we constructed nine pseudo-filoviruses, covering all filovirus genera, for screening of filovirus entry inhibitors in vitro, and we successfully established three in vivo mouse infection models for filovirus entry inhibitor evaluation using the pseudotyped EBOV, Marburg virus (MARV), and Lloviu virus (LLOV) as representative viruses. The robustness of this evaluation system was confirmed by the assessment of two known filovirus entry inhibitors, clomiphene and toremiphene 22 . This sequential in vitro and in vivo filovirus entry inhibitor evaluation system in BSL-2 conditions will provide powerful technical support for the development of broad-spectrum anti-filovirus agents.",

            "text": "In the filovirus family, EBOV, SUDV, BDBV, TAFV, and RESTV are the members which belong to five species of the Ebolavirus genus. RESTV causes asymptomatic infections, and the other four ebolaviruses cause severe and fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans; the Marburgvirus genus contains one species, Marburg marburgvirus, which includes MARV and RAVV; the Cuevavirus genus contains one species, Lloviu cuevavirus, with only one member, LLOV. For all filoviruses, the glycoprotein (GP) is the only viral component responsible for entry, and the phylogenetic relationship between filovirus-GPs is shown in Fig. 1A . In this study, we prepared nine HIV-based pseudofiloviruses covering all species of filovirus. The pseudoviruses were produced by co-transfection of the HIV-core (pNL4-3.Luc. R \u2212 E \u2212 ), which contained a firefly luciferase gene, with the filovirus-GP expressing plasmid into 293 T cells. The packaged HIV/filovirus-GP virions had viral envelopes encased with filovirus-GP, which could mediate one-round viral entry into host cells, and the luciferase in infected cells could be used as a reporter for infectivity evaluation. In this system, besides the HIV/filovirus-GP virions, the HIV-alone virions, which had no envelope glycoprotein, and the HIV/VSV-G virions, with the envelope protein of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G), were also prepared as the model controls. The pseudo-filoviruses infecting 293T cells yielded 6 to 8 log signals, and the HIV-alone virions and HIV/VSV-G virions yielded 2 and 8 log signals, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Clomiphene and toremiphene, two known filovirus entry inhibitors, were evaluated on these pseudoviruses for system validation. As shown in Table 1 , the IC 50 of clomiphene on filoviruses ranged from 0.28 to 2.26 \u03bcmol/L, and the IC 50 of toremiphene on filoviruses ranged from 0.13 to 3.81 \u03bcmol/L; the specificity of the compounds was confirmed by the HIV/VSV-G model (Fig. 1C and D) . These results were consistent with the previously reported effects of the compounds on live ebolavirus and marburgvirus 22 .",

As shown in Fig. 3 , these two pseudo-filoviruses could also effectively infect mice, and the bioluminescence localization in mice was identical with the HIV/EBOV-GP group. All pseudo-filovirus-infected mice showed a chronological bioluminescence increase in intensity; after reaching the peak value, the intensity gradually descended. The time point at which the bioluminescence in pseudo-filovirusinfected mice reached the peak differed slightly: for HIV/EBOV-GP and HIV/MARV-GP groups, the peak appeared around 114 h post-infection (h.p.i.), i.e., the 5th d.p.i., while for HIV/LLOV-GP group, the peak appeared around 90 h.p.i., i.e., the 4th d.p.i. In addition, the HIV/EBOV-GP-infected mice showed a higher peak intensity of bioluminescence than the HIV/MARV-GP and HIV/LLOV-GP groups at a 160 ng p24/mouse dose. In order to obtain identical in vivo viral infecting levels among pseudofiloviruses, the viral dose of 40 ng p24/mouse, at which the HIV/ ng p24/mouse), the mice were tested with the IVIS Spectrum CT imaging system.

            "text": "Ebolaviruses and marburgviruses were discovered in 1976 and 1967, respectively, but neither anti-filovirus drugs nor vaccines have been approved until now. On the other hand, several agents have been reported to be effective against filovirus infection in vitro 7,23 , but few of them have been tested in vivo, which is partially due to the BSL-4 facilities restriction. The infection of host cells with HIV-based pseudovirus is a single round infection mediated by GP-receptor recognition 23 , and expression of the luciferase reporter gene in infected cells or organs can be conveniently used to quantify infection. These features make pseudoviruses a highly secure and efficient model for drug evaluation. Among animal models, the mouse-adapted model is the most widely used for the primary identification of antiviral drugs because of its easy operation and low cost. Therefore, in this study, we established pseudo-filovirus-based in vivo mouse models that can be performed in BSL-2 facilities for compound activity evaluation. For the live virus models, one difficulty is the nonlethal characteristic of wild-type ebolaviruses and marburgviruses in immunocompetent adult mice. Multiple rounds of virus passages had to be conducted and assayed in suckling and immunodeficient mice to obtain the lethal mutant mouse-adapted virus strains for adult mice, and this made the constructions of live ebolavirus and marburgvirus mouse models time-consuming 24, 25 . Moreover, it is also difficult to achieve in vivo live virus infection models for the virus strains of low pathogenicity and the strains that could be identified only by sequencing. Furthermore, the mutated sites of virus proteins of mouse-adapted virus models might cause some drug candidates to be overlooked, especially small compounds targeting just those sites in wild-type viral proteins. These flaws could be compensated for by pseudo-filovirus in vivo models, which could directly use the identical clinically-occurring viral GP gene to construct a corresponding in vivo imaging model. This would nicely reflect the features of clinically existing viruses and allow for quick response when new types of viruses appear.",

(A) A phylogenetic tree based on the filovirus-GP protein sequences examined in the present study was generated using MEGA 6.06 software. All species of Filovirus were included. The strains and corresponding gene accession numbers of GPs are listed in the Materials and Methods. Construction of the phylogenetic tree was conducted using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications; the numbers at the nodes indicate the bootstrap values, and the scale bar indicates the number of amino acid substitutions per site. (B) The infectivity of HIV-based pseudo-filovirus in 293T cells was represented as logarithm (lg) of relative luciferase units. HIV-alone represents the pseudovirions without envelope glycoprotein. The data are represented as the average of three independent experiments. Bars, standard deviations.

EBOV-GP virus showed a comparable bioluminescence intensity to the 160 ng p24/mouse of HIV/MARV-GP and HIV/LLOV-GP infection, was used to further assess the in vivo activity of antifilovirus compounds. To determine whether the inoculated viral doses correlated with the bioluminescence values of infected mice, linear regression analysis was carried out between the total photon flux in mice and the HIV/EBOV-GP viral doses. As shown in Fig. 4, the bioluminescence in HIV/EBOV-GP-infected mice showed a strong linear correlation with viral dose. The linear bioluminescence-dose correlations were also observed in HIV/MARV-GP-and HIV/ LLOV-GP-infected mice (data not shown). The results indicated that the HIV/filovirus-GP infection mouse model could provide accurate assessment of viral infection in living mice.",

Filovirus entry inhibitor activity in vivo can be evaluated by bioluminescence imaging of mice infected with pseudo-filovirus To validate the in vivo model, mice were pretreated with different doses of clomiphene and toremiphene (60, 12, and 2.4 mg/kg of body weight) i.p. once daily on -1 and 0 (-1 h) d.p.i., while the control mice were administered solvent solution (0.5% Tween-80/ saline) simultaneously with the compound groups. At day 0, mice were i.p. challenged with HIV/filovirus-GP virions at 40 ng p24/ mouse for HIV/EBOV-GP, 160 ng p24/mouse for HIV/MARV-GP, and 160 ng p24/mouse for HIV/LLOV-GP, all in 0.2 mL of DMEM. The bioluminescence in mice was examined at 114 h.p.i. for the HIV/EBOV-GP and HIV/MARV-GP groups and at 90 h.p.i. for the HIV/LLOV-GP group. As shown in Fig. 5, the bioluminescence in both clomiphene-and toremiphene-treated groups presented a dosedependent inhibition of HIV/EBOV-GP, HIV/MARV-GP, and HIV/ LLOV-GP viral infection. The specificity of the two drugs was also confirmed by their inability to inhibit HIV/VSV-G virus in vivo (data not shown). These results showed that pseudo-filovirus mouse models can be used for in vivo pharmacodynamics evaluation of anti-filovirus compounds.",
