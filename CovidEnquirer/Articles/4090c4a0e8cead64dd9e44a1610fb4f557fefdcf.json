During an infection with the ZIKV, immune cells have been shown to infiltrate into the tissues. However, the cellular mechanisms that define the protection and/or immunopathogenesis of these immune cells during a ZIKV infection are still largely unknown. Herein, we describe methods to evaluate the virus-specific T-cell functionality in these immunoprivileged organs of ZIKV-infected mice. These methods include a) a ZIKV infection and vaccine inoculation in Ifnar1 -/mice; b) histopathology, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry assays to detect the virus infection and inflammation in the brain, testes, and spleen; c) the preparation of a tetramer of ZIKV-derived T-cell epitopes; d) the detection of ZIKV-specific T cells in the monocytes isolated from the brain, testes, and spleen. Using these approaches, it is possible to detect the antigen-specific T cells that have infiltrated into the immunoprivileged organs and to evaluate the functions of these T cells during the infection: potential immune protection via virus clearance and/or immunopathogenesis to exacerbate the inflammation. These findings may also help to clarify the contribution of T cells induced by the immunization against ZIKV.",

Based on this theory, tetramer technology is a unique tool to elucidate the roles that antigen-specific T cells play in regulating the immune responses 15 . This protocol describes the establishment of the Ifnar1 -/mouse model for ZIKV infections, and the detection of reactive T cells in the spleen, brain, and testes of the mice by using tetramer technology. Additionally, we used the ZIKV-E 294-302 tetramer to detect and evaluate T-cell immunoreactivity induced by a ZIKV vaccine (AdC7-M/ E) in immunized mice. This study provides guidance for investigating T-cell responses in immunoprivileged organs and provides a reference for the potential applications in the placenta or fetal brain.",

Recently, the ZIKV has become a public health emergency, due to its rapid dissemination in the Americas and its unexpected link to microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome 1, 2, 3 . From epidemiological data, the ZIKV has been suspected to be the cause of the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in around 1 per 4,000 infected adults 4 . Moreover, a correlation between the ZIKV and testes infection/damage in the mouse model has been demonstrated, suggesting that the ZIKV infection, under certain circumstances, can bypass the blood-testis barrier and eventually lead to male infertility 5 . These findings highlight the importance of completely understanding the induction of protective or pathologic immune responses during a ZIKV infection.",

CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses to the capsid, envelope, and nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) have been observed in ZIKV-infected monkeys and humans 6, 7, 8 . In mice, several studies have indicated that CD8 + T cells play a protective role in controlling the ZIKV replication 9, 10, 11 . Importantly, Jurado et al. demonstrated that a ZIKV infection results in the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and perivascular infiltration of CD8 + effector T cells within the testes of Ifnar1 -/mice. Furthermore, they showed that CD8 + T cells instigate ZIKV-associated paralysis and appear to play a role in the neonatal brain immunopathology. In a previous study, we prepared the ZIKV-E 294-302 tetramer and showed that ZIKV-specific CD8 + T cells exist in the brains and spinal cords of ZIKV-infected Ifnar1 -/mice, which may have important implications for the design and development of ZIKV vaccines 10 .",

One advantage of the vaccines is their ability to elicit specific T-cell responses, which may be important for protection against the ZIKV.

            "text": "In conclusion, we present the methods of detecting antigen-specific T-cell responses in the immunoprivileged organs of the Ifnar1 -/mouse model for a ZIKV infection. This platform can be widely applied to investigate the immune mechanisms of emerging and re-emerging viruses which can bypass the barriers between the blood and the immunoprivileged organs. Moreover, this study may pave the way for the future development of candidate vaccines and immunotherapies.",

Express and prepare inclusion bodies of H-2D b and \u03b2 2 m as described previously 20 . 3. Renature and purify the MHC/peptide complex H-2D b -E 294-302 . 1. Prepare 200 mL of a refolding solution [100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 400 mM L-arginine, 2 mM EDTA-Na, 5 mM GSG, and 0.5 mM GSSG]. Add protease inhibitors: 2 mL of phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF, stock 100 mM), 100 \u00b5L of pepstatin (stock 2 mg/mL), and 100 \u00b5L of leupeptin (stock 2 mg/mL).Cool the buffer at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. 2. Add H-2D b , \u03b2 2 m, and peptide to the refolding solution. 1. Inject 500 \u00b5L of \u03b2 2 m dissolved in a guanidine solution (30 mg/mL stock) using a syringe. For this, use a 23 G needle with a 5 mL syringe and inject the \u03b2 2 m into the refolding solution drop by drop. Keep the solution constantly and slowly stirring at 150 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. 2. After \u03b2 2 m has been dissolved in the refolding solution, resolve 2 mg of E 294-302 peptide in 200 \u00b5L of DMSO and quickly inject it into the refolding solution using a pipette. Slowly stir the solution at 150 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. 3. Inject 1.5 mL of H-2D b dissolved in a guanidine solution. Keep the stir bar rotating at 150 rpm for the refolding of the H-2D b at 4\u00b0C for 8-10 h. NOTE: The solution was placed in a closed box in a cold room. 3. Concentrate the refolded protein in a pressurized chamber with a 10 kDa membrane. Exchange the buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 50",

Incubate the reaction tube overnight at 4 \u00b0C. CAUTION: Do not add any EDTA to the biotinylating reaction. 5. Purify the MHC using a S200 10/300 GL gel filtration column to remove any extra biotin. 6. Determine the biotinylating efficiency with a streptavidin-shift assay 18 . 1. Prepare three samples, A, B, and C, on ice for 30 min. Then, analyze the results by a 10% SDS-PAGE. Sample A consists of 8 \u00b5L of biotinylated MHC molecules and 2 \u00b5L of exchange buffer, sample B of 8 \u00b5L of biotinylated MHC molecules and 2 \u00b5L of streptavidin (20 mg/mL), and sample C of 2 \u00b5L of streptavidin (20 mg/mL) and 8 \u00b5L exchange buffer. CAUTION: Do not boil the sample. 7. Form multimers of the biotinylated MHC molecules. 1. Produce tetramer by mixing the biotinylated E 294-302 peptide-H 2 D b complex with phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin at a mole ratio of 1:5 to ensure a complete binding of all the biotinylated MHC molecules. 2. Calculate the amount of streptavidin-conjugate needed for tetramerization. 1. Determine the moles of the MHC/peptide complexes accounting for the protein concentration and the molar weight (example: 1.8 mg of total protein = 40 nmol). 2. Calculate the moles of the streptavidin-conjugate needed by dividing the moles of the MHC/peptide by 5 (example: 40/5 = 8 nmol of streptavidin-conjugate).",
