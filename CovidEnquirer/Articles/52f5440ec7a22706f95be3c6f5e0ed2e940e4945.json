Our hospital is a regional Journal of Infection (2005) hospital serving a population of 1 million in the northwestern part of Hong Kong. Treatment during the epidemic had been empirical. While corticosteroid had been the mainstay of treatment of SARS in Hong Kong, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] it was not a routine treatment elsewhere. [6] [7] [8] The use of corticosteroid in the treatment of SARS has since become controversial. Some had been sceptical about its therapeutic value, especially in higher dosages, which carry immediate and long-term side effects. We performed a retrospective cohort study on the effect of corticosteroid in a group of SARS patients admitted between March and May 2003. ",

The theoretical rational is the similarity of the radiological and histological features between bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP) and SARS pneumonia. Since corticosteroid has been shown to be effective against BOOP, it was postulated that it could be useful in reducing the complication of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS. Our series had a high mortality rate (26.9%). The adverse prognostic factors were similar to those in other reports, namely advanced age, presence of comorbidities and high peak LDH level. 1, 3, 6, 8, 9 Despite more favourable baseline characteristics (younger with less comorbidities) and similar peak LDH levels, the corticosteroid group had more adverse outcomes (37.9% vs. 16.7%), though it did not reach statistical significance. The adverse effect of corticosteroid therapy might have been masked by the younger age and better pre-morbid condition of the corticosteroid therapy group. We have therefore tried to eliminate this confounding effect by multivariate adjustment. Corticosteroid usage had then turned out to be a statistically significant independent adverse factor and was associated with more than 20-fold risk of unfavourable outcomes.",
