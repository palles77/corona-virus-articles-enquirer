The system, based on earlier efforts in The Netherlands and Portugal, works with the participation of the population in each country to collect real-time information on the distribution of influenza-like illness cases through web surveys administered to volunteers reporting their symptoms (or lack of symptoms) every week during the influenza season. Such a large European-wide web-based monitoring infrastructure is intended to rapidly identify public health emergencies, contribute to understanding global trends, inform data-driven forecast models to assess the impact on the population, optimize the allocation of resources, and help in devising mitigation and containment measures. In this article, we describe the scientific and technological issues faced during the development and deployment of a flexible and readily deployable web tool capable of coping with the requirements of different countries for data collection, during either a public health emergency or an ordinary influenza season. Even though the system is based on previous successful experience, the implementation in each new country represented a separate scientific challenge. Only after more than 5 years of development are the existing platforms based on a plug-and-play tool that can be promptly deployed in any country wishing to be part of the Influenzanet network, now composed of The Netherlands,",

One of the major issues is that, for diseases such as influenza-like illness (ILI), only an unknown proportion of all infected individuals see a doctor. In addition, consultations frequently occur with a considerable delay, taking place only when a complication has occurred or a doctor's certificate is required (for example, in Sweden such a certificate is not required until after 1 week of absence from work). Other issues concern: the time delay in data reporting and aggregation; the lack of information on the patterns of household transmission; the lack of uniform standards for clinical definitions, which may vary considerably between countries and even between reporters (European Influenza Surveillance Network). Furthermore, age-stratified rates of physician consultation may vary widely with different healthcare and health insurance systems. Healthcare-seeking behaviour can change unpredictably during an epidemic, making extrapolations of those statistics to the general population uncertain.",

The purpose was to inform the general population about influenza by means of a self-reporting Internet platform in Dutch (http://www.degrotegriepmeting.nl), where volunteers in The Netherlands and Belgium (the Flemish part) could answer socio-demographic, medical and behavioural questions, and report their influenzarelated symptoms each week. User participation was achieved through targeted communication and recruitment. A positive side effect of this project was the collection of almost real-time data about influenza, including from individuals who did not visit a doctor when ill. Knowledge of volunteers' postal codes allowed the real-time collection of data at the postal code level. Thanks to a vigorous communication campaign using both online and offline media, the project attracted 20 000 users during this first season.",

In Portugal, during the first 2 years of the project, approximately 5000 volunteers were attracted [3] . On the basis of this success, the computational epidemiology group of the ISI Foundation in Turin, Italy decided to deploy a similar platform during the winter of 2007, to carry out influenza surveillance with the aim of informing computational models for studying the spread of ILI on a large scale. Data collected by these four platforms have been evaluated [3, 4] (Paolotti et al., 3rd International ICST Conference on Electronic Healthcare for the 21st Century, 2010, Abstract no. 30), and the estimated seasonal influenza incidence curves have been found to be in good agreement with those from the former European Influenza Surveillance Scheme.",

The proposed network of web platforms, called Influenzanet (http://www.influenzanet. eu), saw, for the first time, the collaboration of epidemiologists, public health practitioners and modellers with the aim of collecting epidemiological data in real time through the contributions of Internet volunteers self-selected from among the general population. The epidemiology teams devised reference standard questionnaires for different diseases to collect unified data across European countries (presented in the supporting information). ILI has been the focus in the early deployment of the system, but the final goal is to considerably enlarge the portfolio of diseases and health conditions monitored. In June 2009, the plans to export the platform to other European countries were accelerated by the unfolding of the H1N1 pandemic in the northern hemisphere. A web system very similar to the Italian platform was rapidly deployed in the UK (https://flusurvey.org.uk/) to capture the whole progress of the H1N1 pandemic, with the involvement of the mathematical modelling group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. This work allowed researchers to detect the differences in healthcare-seeking behaviour between different population groups and changes over time, with significant implications for estimates of total case numbers and the case-fatality rate [5, 6] .",

These features were included in a plug-and-play implementation to lessen the burden of deploying the platform in new countries, and to let the local teams concentrate on the communication and dissemination needed to attract participants, instead of having to deal with technical problems. The new Influenzanet system started to be deployed in October 2010. The localization, translation, testing and fine-tuning activities took place between October 2010 and February 2011. This powerful and flexible new platform has been successfully adopted by all of the 'old' countries (The Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, the UK, and Italy), and, thanks to its plug-and-play features, it was deployed, in December 2011, in Sweden by the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, and by the Institut National de la Sant e et de la Recherche M edicale in France. In both cases, in <2 months, the platform saw the enrolment of several thousands of participants from all over the country. The system has since been successfully deployed in Spain at the Instituto de Biocomputacion y F \u0131sica de Sistemas Complejos, at the University of Saragoza, in September 2012, in Denmark at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, and in Ireland at the College of Engineering & Informatics, National University of Ireland, Galway in August 2013.",

The questionnaires can be used to monitor ILI in the community in real time, to track vaccine effectiveness [3, 4, 7, 8] , and to estimate risk factors for ILI (not shown here).",

The success of the data collection strongly depends on the extent of participation of the volunteers involved in the projects. The determinants of participation and the representativeness of the self-selected cohorts of participants in the various countries have been explored elsewhere [9] . In order to assess how the web-based systems for ILI surveillance can be a useful addition to the GP-based system, we present the cross-year and cross-country incidence data, which can be readily compared and easily collected, once the platforms are in place. The national platforms collect data about the health status of the active cohort volunteers during the whole duration of the influenza season. Participants are considered to be active if they have completed, on average, at least one symptoms questionnaire every 3 weeks since the registration. To define ILI, the following ILI case definition is used, which resembles the WHO guidelines [10] : a sudden onset of fever, namely, a measured body temperature of \u226538\u00b0C, accompanied by headache or muscle pain, and accompanied by cough or a sore throat. The date of fever onset is used as the date of ILI onset.",
