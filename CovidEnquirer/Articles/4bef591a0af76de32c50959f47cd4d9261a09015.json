Okwo-Bele highlighted the achievements of global immunisation: polio eradication is close, with only two countries currently reporting wild poliovirus; measles vaccination has reduced the disease by over 79% from 2000 to 2014 [1] ; regional meningitis A epidemics have been eliminated in Africa, with half of the population vaccinated [2] ; in all, around 6 million deaths have been averted by vaccination [3] . Still, challenges remain. Limitations in vaccine affordability and supply, failures in healthcare integration, disruption of immunisation by geopolitical conflict and poor-quality health data have resulted in stagnant coverage and repeated failure to reach immunisation goals. For instance, in 2014, 3.2 million children missed their 3rd dose of DTP 1 in the Eastern Mediterranean region, mostly in security-compromised countries [4] . Solutions expected from manufacturers include measures to assure the controlled temperature chain (CTC) where cold-chain facilities are lacking, implementation of improved delivery technologies for ease of use in the field, and assistance in reducing risk of shortages. The monitoring and accountability framework of GVAP identifies and responds to immunisation challenges.",

More antigens are incorporated into multi-valent combination vaccines (pentavalent 2 vaccine replacing DTP, and MMR/MR 3 replacing measles vaccine) and new, complex vaccines are being introduced. A robust vaccine development pipeline is emerging from both industrialised and developing countries. From the latter, the Serum Institute of India's meningitis A vaccine reached 217 million people in 2015 [5] , and it is anticipated that Japanese encephalitis vaccine from Chengdu Institute, China, will reach 290 million people by 2017. DCVMN members play an essential role in global vaccine supply, contributing to improving health and driving new markets. They are diverse in terms of ownership (state or private), scale, portfolio and market (local providers or emerging new multinational companies, Fig. 1 ). It is important to understand their role and plan for anticipated changes in global versus national financing and procurement of vaccines.",

Such convergence and/or harmonisa-1 DTP = diphtheria + tetanus + pertussis combination vaccines. 2 tion needs to be implemented consistently and intentionally to succeed. WHO's role in promoting access to quality medical products is to develop norms and standards and promote regulatory convergence and harmonisation. Through WHO initiatives, benefits and challenges can be identified, efficient collaboration among regulators fostered and in-country regulatory decisions supported. Collaboration should replace duplication. H. Deehan from UNICEF briefed the audience on prevention and remediation strategies to manage vaccine supply constraints. UNICEF's procurement and supply of vaccines to countries needing assistance with vaccination programmes has increased significantly over the years. Since 2013, more than 50% of doses procured annually have been from suppliers in developing countries. Recent supply constraints have included BCG 4 , yellow fever vaccine, and IPV 5 vaccine to support the polio endgame strategy. Early and transparent communication with manufacturers and close monitoring of stock levels within countries is required to allow prompt mitigation actions and ultimately reduce risk of interrupted supply. Deehan invited DCVMN members to work with UNICEF to achieve sustained global supply of affordable vaccines of assured quality.",

Pentavalent, pneumococcal and rotavirus vaccines have been steadily introduced in a growing number of countries, surpassing Gavi expectations. The volume of vaccines from DCVMs 6 continues to grow, although the value of vaccines procured from DCVMs remains relatively low. To secure global supply, Gavi has fostered procurement from multiple countries and manufacturers ( Fig. 2A and B ). In terms of activities, Gavi introduced two major changes in their co-financing policy in 2015: (i) linking co-financing to prices for all countries in transition phases and (ii) developing payment plans to help countries get out of default. Gavi's strategic goals for 2016-2020 include a vaccine goal: to accelerate equitable uptake and coverage of vaccines, a health system goal: to increase effectiveness and efficiency of immunisation delivery as a part of strengthened health systems, a financing goal: to improve sustainability of national immunisation programs, and a market-shaping goal: to shape markets for vaccines and other immunisation products [8] . With these goals, Gavi hopes to immunise 300 million additional children around the world by the end of 2020.",

This was enabled by the commitment of member countries to regional goals, the PAHO Revolving Fund and vaccine manufacturers. He then outlined challenges faced with vaccine shortages and strategies to overcome these. Latin American populations are under the threat from yellow fever virus because vaccine demand exceeds the number of doses available annually by 6-8 million [9] . To avoid supply shortages, countries need concrete demand planning, secured budgets for vaccine purchases and careful stock management. Prevention of shortages starts at country level, while PAHO acts regionally to facilitate timely and sufficient supply, and vaccine manufacturers worldwide are essential for assured global supply.",

Finlay is developing a 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine. Verez noted that, as 70% of the world's infants are not yet vaccinated against pneumococcal disease, it may be useful to have an affordable 7valent vaccine that protects against regional disease strains, while waiting for higher valency vaccines to become accessible to middle and low-income populations. Head-to-head studies may help understand the impact of multivalent vaccines compared to regionally relevant formulations. Leroy asked how a manufacturer such as Innovax could accelerate WHO PQ and how DCVMN members could support their clinical development. Huang stated that the DCVMN is able to break barriers between countries and facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing; it is a matter of calling for such an initiative. Harmonisation of the quality of clinical trials and DCVMN's role in calling for convergence between regulators was encouraged. A. Precioso commented that DCVMN has several initiatives, including workshops on clinical trial management to harmonise practices and support WHO prequalification of vaccines. DCVMN needs time to develop such complex initiatives, and collaborations between companies can contribute, by enabling joint-clinical development and international multicentric clinical trials. D. Curry (Centre for Vaccine Ethics and Policy), whose expertise lies in ethical and legal requirements for and oversight of clinical trials, suggested that one area of support to DCVMs might be development of ethical frameworks to guide clinical trial design, conduct and assessment.",

            "text": "The discussion on developing markets was moderated by J. Chu, Senior Director of Vaccine Markets at the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI). He noted that vaccine markets are unique: it requires a high investment for manufacturers, and the lengthy development times, can often result unintentionally in supply monopoly. Changes in regulatory standards can cause disruption and delays in lot release and registration. Despite the challenges, DCVMN members have been contributing significantly to increasing access to vaccines globally. In 2013, the human-vaccine market was estimated at US$25 billion and it is forecasted to reach US$38 billion by 2020 [26] . To seize the opportunities and compete successfully in this rapidly growing global market, manufacturers need to continuously innovate. M. Malhame (Gavi) raised the balance between affordability and sustainability of vaccine supply, explaining that Gavi evaluates any new vaccine that has passed phase II clinical trials for inclusion in the vaccines' portfolio financed by Gavi. This evaluation is data-driven, and includes parameters such as disease burden, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of disease prevention. However, she noted that coordination and alignment between global stakeholders need to improve and ensure development of the most needed vaccines. She also commented that the high costs of vaccine development, relative to those of drugs or diagnostics, could be overcome in part by technologies to improve manufacturing processes. K. Ella (Bharat Biotech) shared insights on building successful international partnerships and balancing private and public contributions. Privatisation of manufacturing has resulted in stable vaccine supply in many countries, and private enterprise can enhance supply of public-sector. L. Shi (Zerun Institute, Walvax) discussed corporate motivation to enter international markets while also serving the needs of domestic markets. Walvax is prioritizing product-portfolio investments to allow supply of vaccines internationally. Large manufacturing capacity is required to satisfy both domestic and international markets and many Chinese companies have this capacity, thus the world is likely to see more vaccines from Chinese manufacturers in future. F. Lobos described Sinergium's journey into the vaccine market in South America. Sinergium was a spin-off from a veterinarian vaccine manufacturer in 2009. It established technology transfer agreements with large multinationals, primarily to satisfy the national needs for influenza, pneumococcal and HPV vaccines. Importantly, partnerships with government accelerated their progress: technical support was received from the local regulatory agency in building a world-class facility complying with international standards; also, a multi-year governmental supply contract secured stability for the company. Both local and international partners were critical for rapid success. Now, with modern facilities and equipment, the company aims to expand partnerships with DCVMs.",

Sampson (APACI) on trust in vaccines. S. Jadhav described the experiences of the Serum Institute of India, one of the largest and most successful manufacturers from emerging countries, with 23 WHO-prequalified vaccines. Still reluctance to purchase products from developing countries on the basis of perceived higher reactogenicity or preference for known brands is a barrier to acceptance of new products. Measles vaccine was prequalified by WHO in 1993, however UNICEF did not immediately take it up. Serum Institute supplied more than 90% of the measles-containing vaccines used to achieve measles and rubella eradication in Latin America. For the introduction of meningitis A vaccine in African countries, community leaders were informed about benefits, resulting in high acceptance and very successful prevention of disease. The lesson is that industry needs to invest considerable effort into informing stakeholders of their products and intentions. A. Batson noted that vaccine hesitancy is often specific to a country or situation, rather than a global issue, and strongly agreed that engaging the local community leaders can have significant impact on uptake. Interestingly, mobile phones have proven useful to advocate for vaccines for teenagers, such as HPV vaccines. K. Sampson discussed the confidence in influenza vaccines, where there is a risk that the strains that make up the vaccine may not fully match those causing disease, due to antigenic drift. He noted that Asia has a large ethnically and socio-culturally heterogeneous population and a vaccine may not suit all patients. Decision-making on influenza vaccination is driven by whether it is likely to protect the vaccinated individual, and also, whether is it likely to help protect others through herd immunity. Ready availability of disease data that can be communicated to medical professionals would assist in highlighting value. P. Carrasco elaborated further on the role of health workers delivering vaccines, noting that they build patient trust by imparting their knowledge of the vaccines and vaccination, but also inspire confidence when they clearly trust the intervention themselves. Educational programs, organised by professional associations, need to provide health professionals with the right information about why and how vaccines are used, in their own language. New tools, such as smart phones, are within reach of most health workers, even in low-income countries.",

To achieve global immunisation, local authorities and community leaders play an important role in the decision-making in vaccine introduction and uptake, based on the ability of vaccines to protect vaccinated people and protect non-vaccinated in the community through herd immunity. Reducing the risk of vaccine shortages can be achieved by increasing regulatory convergence at regional and international levels. Combatting preventable diseases outbreaks remains challenging, and collective efforts for improving multi-centre clinical trials including various populations, creating regional relevant vaccine manufacturing and stockpiling security strategies, fostering stable vaccine markets and procurement, and building trust in vaccines are recommended approaches. The DCVMN members will continue to collaborate with one another, with partners and with regulators towards the goal of improving global access to immunisation, through sustainable supply of vaccines to match demand, as well as greater capacity to rapidly respond to outbreaks. The aim is to provide high quality vaccines for all people.",
