VIZIER is a multidisciplinary project involving (i) bioinformatics to define functional domains, (ii) viral genomics to increase the number of characterized viral genomes and prepare defined targets, (iii) proteomics to express, purify, and characterize targets, (iv) structural biology to solve their crystal structures, and (v) pre-lead discovery to propose active scaffolds of antiviral molecules.",

            "text": "Since the discovery of the deadly Ebola virus (filovirus) in 1976 a series of previously unknown pathogenic (emerging) viruses have been discovered, with greater human communication and mobility contributing to awareness and spread, respectively. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), since its discovery in 1983, has killed more than 25 million people and that about 40 million people are today infected with the virus. In 1993, a then unknown lethal hantavirus the Sin Nombre virus, emerged in the Western USA. Shortly thereafter, two unknown paramyxoviruses, both causing lethal diseases, emerged: Nipah virus in Malaysia and Hendra virus in Australia. Before 2002, human coronaviruses were known to cause only mild upper respiratory tract infections. However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), which appeared in 2002, was highly pathogenic and had a high fatality rate. The avian influenza virus H5N1 strain was first isolated from humans in 1996 in Hong Kong and has caused, since 2003, about 200 casualties. H5N1, as well as other avian influenza viruses, have the potential to develop, either by genetic drift or recombination with other influenza virus strains, into viruses that are highly pathogenic to humans and which have the potential of causing a pandemic. Several viruses have, in recent years, widely expanded their territory, causing the death of an increasing number of people. One such example is the West Nile flavivirus, that was introduced into the USA in 1999, and has since then become endemic in the entire USA and parts of Canada with extensions into Latin America. In the period 2005/2006, the Chikungunya alphavirus resulted in more than 500 000 cases in the islands of the Indian Ocean, probably more than 1.5 million cases in India and is currently sweeping through large parts of southeast Asia, central Africa, and recently Italy. Since the 1970s the number of people infected with the dengue virus (a flavivirus) has been dramatically increasing. In 1975, the WHO surveillance network reported 10 dengue endemic countries and \u223c60 000 dengue cases. In 2005, the WHO reported 65 dengue-infested countries, with 1 million reported cases and an estimate of 50 millions actual cases/year.",

            "text": "On the basis of this large, but non-exhaustive list, it is evident that almost all newly emerging, human pathogenic viruses belong to the group of RNA viruses. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of RNA viruses have no proofreading capability. As a consequence, these viruses have a very high mutation rate on average about one mutation/virus/replication cycle, allowing fast adaptation to new hosts and environments. Another remarkable observation is that almost all emerging viral infections are zoonotic in nature. The natural hosts for Ebola, HIV, Nipah, Hendra, SARS, H5N1, Sin Nombre, are animals such as bats, monkeys and birds, in which they often have no strong pathogenic effect. An enormous number of yet undiscovered viruses exist in vertebrates. One can state with a high degree of certainty that novel, sometimes highly lethal RNA viruses, will emerge in the future from this large natural genetic pool. Human activities such as deforestation and international travel as well as the results of climate change may facilitate the emergence of such viruses. Other RNA viruses that are known to be pathogenic to man may emerge in regions where they are not yet present, as examplified by the dengue virus in recent years. In addition, changes in the fragile balance of specific ecological niches, may favour emergence of novel pathogenic agents.",

A human population of more than 6 billion people must also be prepared for the inevitable emergence of new, highly contagious and lethal viral infections of other origins. The introduction of HIV, the Ebola virus, Sin Nombre virus, Nipah, Hendra, SARS CoV, and many other novel viruses, in the human population was not, and could not have been predicted. Likewise, we are today unable to predict which virus may emerge tomorrow. Preparedness to meet such a threat of an emerging virus includes the ability to rapidly characterize the virus and to be able to take the necessary measures for control. The latter may include vector control, development of vaccines as well as the development of selective antiviral drugs. The former two strategies are most appropriate when a threat has been recognised (i.e. effective in prevention of infection) whilst the latter are essential for quick response to an unknown threat. Today antiviral drugs are only available for the treatment of infections with herpesviruses, the hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV and influenza viruses. In addition Ribavirin has been approved and has shown clinical benefit for the treatment of Lassa virus infections. No specific therapy is available for the treatment of other viral infections. In fact, a crucial statement has to be made here. The drugs that are available against these viruses, have required decades of scientific effort both in the academic and industrial sectors for their development.",

For most of the RNA viruses, very fundamental insights into potential molecular targets for therapy are lacking. When the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the causative agent of the SARS epidemic, research on anti-coronavirus drugs was in its infancy and no knowledge was available as to how to selectively inhibit the replication of a coronavirus. Since then, many important advances have been made, although a search for antivirals against SARS-CoV has yet to produce drugs approved for human treatment. Sadly, one can state with near certainty that no antiviral drugs will be available for the treatment of infections of the next newly emerging virus.",

Stuart, Oxford, UK) was the prototype of a large-scale, European structural proteomics project launched by the European Union in 2001. Amongst the eukaryotic targets, SPINE contained one workpackage dedicated to viral proteins. At that time, the frustration of virologists facing large-scale genomic projects originated from the small genome size of viruses. It was obvious that viruses of the Herpesviridae or Poxviridae could present respectable targets. The true innovation, however, came with the proposition that studying large families of related viruses could in fact address the well-known problem of poor crystallization success rate. For example, the structure of the first flavivirus polymerase, even from an obscure virus, would immediately have an impact on the whole flavivirus field. Additionally molecular replacement techniques would then considerably speed up the structure solu-tion of more medically important flavivirus polymerases once crystals became available. We also hoped that a gallery of structures from similar viruses would uncover small, as yet-unknown differences that could translate into larger in vivo differences, impacting for example on pathogenic properties, host range and mechanistics peculiarities. In fact, this approach had been met with partial success for RNA viruses. The main difficulties originated from the shortage of properly defined viral targets. In other words, at the time, it was a bit ambitious to start structural proteomics without addressing viral genomics. VIZIER, which started as an European FP6 Integrated Project in October 2004 with a 13 million D budget, specifically addressed this limitation by providing a comprehensive structural characterization of a diverse set of RNA viruses. In the meantime, a part of the efforts in the SPINE project were devoted to method developments, and technical progress implemented in the individual laboratories were combined. This study (published as special issue in Acta Crystallogaphica Section D, Volume 62, Part 10, October 2006) provided strategic information needed to set up a pipeline adapted for Structural and Functional Genomics of viral proteins involved in replication.",

Because of their size and complex Fig. 1 . The pipeline organization of the VIZIER project, with its core (large symbols) and satellite labs (smaller symbols) represented by the numbers 1-25; The numbers 1-25 correspond to the a-z author laboratory addresses, respectively. organization, the production and crystallization of recombinant full-length viral proteins is notoriously difficult and usually associated with low expression levels, protein degradation and/or insolubility. To ensure a high success rate at the production, purification and crystallization steps, expression of each domain individually as well as combinations of domains was adopted as a main VIZIER strategy. Its success relies on a reliable dissection of the domain organization of viral polyproteins that is accomplished through the use of two complementary approaches utilizing, respectively, the VirAliS (Virus Alignment Suite) (Gorbalenya et al., unpublished) and VaZyMolO (Viral Enzymes Modular Organization) (Ferron et al., 2005) software platforms developed and advanced by researchers of LUMC/MSU (Viralis) and AFMB (VaZyMolO). The partners in the VIZIER consortium communicate with these platforms through dedicated web servers. Viralis provides a state-of-theart multi-modular environment for expert analysis of RNA virus genomes using multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis. A recent study of the origin and evolution of poliovirus (Jiang et al., 2007) is a good example. It has been used for delineation of a large variety of domains also including those that are functionally poorly characterized and those that are hard to express in soluble form. The VaZyMolO platform allows the VIZIER partners to make, or refine, their own domain predictions, using different bioinformatic tools (BLAST, HCA plot, etc.) and to access information on previously made predictions using old and new RNA virus sequences. It will be interesting to compare the crystallization success rate for domains predicted using Viralis and VaZyMolO.",

An incredible discrepancy was also observed between published viral sequences and the actual sequences of produced viral proteins. A cruel fact is that many virology laboratories work with viruses which differ appreciably in sequence from the native isolates. Likewise, there were large virus families for which complete genome sequences were quite fragmentary (see the flavivirus example below). As a consequence, VIZIER is first a viral genomics program, upon which structural genomics and early lead discovery work is superimposed. The virology section is involved in the genomics part of the project by (i) implementing viral growth and virus storage under appropriate bio-safety level conditions, (ii) sequencing the viral genomes and depositing sequences in public databases, and (iii) analyzing the sequence data for the purpose of virus identification as well as for evolution/phylogeny studies. No attempt has been made to collect and centralize biological material. Dangerous viruses are cultivated under appropriate safety conditions by laboratories already experienced with this task. Initially the tasks of the Section had to span about 145 viruses and this ambitious goal required the design of protocols adapted for large-scale genome sequencing (Emonet et al., 2007) . This procedure, by generating long cDNAs, enabled easy subsequent one-step amplifications of domains designed by Section 1 for protein domain expression.",

This strategy is validated since the Meaban virus domain was solved with the smaller construct whereas the Yokose virus one was solved with the larger (Mastrangelo et al., 2006a) .

The complementary C-terminal RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain was subsequently shown to be functional as well. Given this information, coupled with the large number of human pathogens within the genus, it is thus not surprising that flaviviruses were early targets of the VIZIER project. Progress within this important viral genus illustrates the exciting merging of traditional virology and genomics, with structural and functional proteomics.

The virtual high-throughput screening focused on the Sadenosyl-l-methionine (SAM, which is the methyl donor for the methyltransfer) binding site based on the structure of the dengue virus NS5 MTase domain (NS5MTase DV ) in complex with GTP analogs and S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) as shown in Fig. 4A (Egloff et al., 2002) . The procedure started with a pharmacophore and a 2D similarity search of a database of 2.1 million commercially available compounds. After docking a set of selected ligands, 17 top-ranking compounds, representing different scaffolds, were purchased. Inhibitory activity was tested on recombinant NS5MTase DV using the capped RNA (Grard et al., 2006) . This figure was prepared by Gilda Grard (Unit\u00e9 des Virus Emergents, Marseille). substrate 7Me GpppAC 5 to measure (adenosine-2 O) methyltransferase activity . Finally, we identified a novel inhibitor with a previously unknown scaffold (see Fig. 4B ) showing moderate inhibitory activity (see Fig. 4C ). In addition another SAH analog, sinefungin, was identified as a potent inhibitor (in the submicromolar range), as were other SAH analogs which proved to be moderate inhibitors (unpublished results) . Although capping might not be a primary target, because there is only a single RNA capping event, during replication of the Flavivirus genome, these compounds deserve further attention since they could be combined with other anti-viral molecules.",

Several flavivirus NS5 genes had their MTase N-terminal domains removed, but the largest part of the challenge was to find a soluble RdRp domain construct that was enzymatically active, but that would crystallize easily. Up to 70 constructs were designed, and of these a single (a.a. 273-900 of NS5) enzymatically active one could be crystallized which diffracted to 3.0\u00c5 resolution. Unfortunately it did not allow phase determination either using selenomethionine-substituted protein or more conventional heavy atom methods. Another construct (a.a. 317-900) gave crystals of an inactive enzyme, whose structure was solved at 2.4\u00c5, and used as a model to solve the original, enzymatically active protein . Both the construct length, and later, the coordinates were made available to the Lescar group, which expedited the crystal structure solution of the dengue virus RdRp domain in complex with a nucleotide at 1.8\u00c5 resolution (Yap et al., 2007) . We fully anticipate that these two first flavivirus polymerase structures will speed up crystal structure solution of other flavivirus polymerases, such as those of the BSL-4 hemorrhagic viruses, which could, then, be removed from the category of neglected, but deadly, pathogens. Led by the Novartis Institute of Tropical Diseases (NITD) in Singapore, there is currently a very active research programme merging high-throughput screening results (i.e. hits) with crystal soaking experiments in order to drive forward the structure-based drug-design efforts on flavivirus RdRps.",

The hunger for novel structures is often in contradiction with the crystal structure determination of many similar structures (for example using molecular replacement techniques) inside a given virus family. But it is imperative to realize that even if VIZIER did not contribute to many original folds yet, this potential disenchantment on the part of structural biologists is not shared with virologists, who foresee connection of long-known virus-specific data (e.g. host range and specificity, disease specificity, geographical distribution, to name but a few) with new structural data. We realize that an understanding of systems biology has implications and applications in host-pathogen interactions. Besides the obvious desire to be prepared to tackle an emerging disease, the information content of a large number of crystal structures within a virus family cannot be currently estimated. Likewise, the anticipated crystal structures of complexes of replicases with substrates or, perhaps more importantly, protein partners will surely benefit from the wealth of structures determined both within VIZIER project and elsewhere. Before starting the flavivirus polymerase project, it was not possible to predict which flavivirus polymerase domain would yield a crystal structure. The same difficulty will apply to the flavivirus NS3-NS5 complexes, but the availability of many helicase and polymerase structures is likely to speed up exciting crystallographic work on these complexes.",
