Both siRNAs knockdown or silenced the target RABV genes as evaluated in a plasmid based transient expression model. For efficient delivery, adenoviruses expressing the siRNAs were constructed and antiviral potential of the delivered siRNAs was investigated in BHK-21 cells. When cells treated with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged with RABV, there was 88.35 \u00b1 2.4% and 41.52 \u00b1 9.3% reduction in RABV multiplication in infected cells with siRNAs targeting RABV-N and L genes, respectively. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR revealed knockdown of both RABV-N and L gene transcripts, however, significant reduction was observed only with adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N. When mice treated intracerebrally with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs were challenged peripherally with lethal RABV by the intramuscular route in masseter muscle, there was 66.6% and 33.3% protection with adenoviruses expressing siRNAs against RABV-N and L genes, respectively. These results demonstrated that adenovirus expressing siRNA against RABV-N efficiently inhibited the RABV multiplication both, in vitro and in vivo and conferred significant protection against lethal RABV challenge. This supported the hypothesis that RNAi, based on siRNA targeting RABV-N gene can prevent RABV infection and holds the potential of RNAi as an approach to prevent rabies infection.",

It is a highly conserved natural mechanism described for plants, fungi, worms, insects, and mammals (Ma et al., 2007, for review) . The gene silencing mechanism is mediated by short RNA, named siRNAs, whereby an RNA-induced silencing complex forms an activated complex that target mRNA with sequence complementary to the siRNAs. This renders the mRNA transcripts inert and degradable resulting in a specific knockdown of the targeted gene expression. The sequence-specific knockdown of viral genes in infected cells generated great interest in development of siRNAsbased antiviral agents. siRNA-based antiviral activity has been reported for many RNA and DNA viruses in vitro and in vivo, including, human immunodeficiency virus, poliovirus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human papilloma virus, dengue virus, hepatitis delta virus, murine gamma herpesviruses, severe acute coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus infections (Sliva and Schnierle, 2010, for review) .",

There are few reports on in vitro evaluation of RNAi on rabies targeting viral structural genes like, N, and G (Israsena et al., 2009) where targeting N gene was found to be effective. RABV-G remained a unsuccessful target for RNAi because RABV-G is considered to be non-essential for virus replication in vitro in cultured cells and required only for trans-synaptic viral spread between neurons in vivo (Etessami et al., 2000; Yan et al., 2002) .

Consequently, we selected RABV-N and L as our target genes for designing siRNAs as these are conserved and essential for virus multiplication. Moreover, while selecting siRNAs, the conserved region on RABV genome with no potential region for secondary structure formation was considered using siRNA designing algorithm. Since screening of effective siRNAs with infectious viruses is tedious, time-consuming and requires intense safety conditions, a simple method for the screening of potent siRNAs was used in the present study. We demonstrated that transient co-transfection of a reporter gene construct and a silencing construct was an appropriate method to screen potent siRNAs by inducing cleavage of the mRNA fused to red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter by gene-specific siRNA. This provided a simple model for assessing the siRNA efficiency for gene silencing by analysis (reduced expression) of the fusion protein expression with fluorescent microscope. The si-N and si-L consistently inhibited the expression of RFP fusion version of RABV-N or L proteins in three independent experiments and indicated potent siRNAs for further studies. Screening of effective siRNAs using transient co-transfection of plasmids has been reported previously for targets other than RABV genes (Sanchez et al., 2005; Meng et al., 2007; Ong et al., 2008) .",

For in vivo delivery of siRNA against rabies, a technology is required that could deliver the RNAi therapeutic to neuronal cells. Adenovirus and lentivirus based viral vectors carry out precisely this task and have become a major delivery system for siRNA into nerve tissues (Sliva and Schnierle, 2010) .

Since RABV-PV-11 strain is adapted to BHK-21 cells, it served as a model to analyze the efficiency of siRNAs in vitro. RNAi functions by identifying and degrading mRNA that shares sequence complementarity with the siRNA. Therefore, real-time PCR analysis was used to analyze the effect of si-N or si-L on RABV-N or L mRNA expression, respectively. The level of RABV-N mRNA in the Ad-Ntreated, RABV-infected cells was significantly reduced (1442-fold) compared to the Ad-L-treated cells (1.43-fold). GAPDH was used as a cellular mRNA control and showed no effect of the siRNA treatment. Further, the level of RABV-L mRNA in Ad-N-treated cells was also reduced (380-fold), indicating an interrelated effect. This may be due to the fact that RABV-N performs its effect on RABV multiplication in two ways; RABV-N is a major structural protein and also plays a regulatory role in the switch from gene expression (mRNA production) to genome replication. The intracellular ratio of leader RNA to N protein has been reported to regulate the switch from viral gene transcription to genome replication (Wunner, 1991) . To confirm the antiviral potential of RABV-N-specific siRNAs, we monitored the presence of viral progeny in the supernatants of siRNA-treated-RABV infected cells. The level of fold-decrease in RABV-N expression was correlated with decrease in infective virus titer in Ad-N treated cells. The decrease in infective RABV titer in Ad-N-treated cells was 88.4% compared to 41.5% in Ad-L-treated cells.",

The protective efficacy of different siRNAs against lethal RABV challenge was evaluated by injecting recombinant adenoviruses carrying appropriate siRNAs intracerebrally in mice and challenging with mouse adapted RABV-CVS-11 strain. Mice treated with Ad-N, which showed maximum inhibitory effect on RABV multiplication in vitro in BHK-21 cells also demonstrated significantly high protection (66.6%). In contrast, mice treated with Ad-L, which was less effective in vitro, were moderately protected (33.3%). The control siRNA-expressing adenovirus could not demonstrate protection, indicating lethal nature of the challenge virus. Recent studies have also indicated that short RABV-N cDNA and artificial microRNAs could interfere with RABV replication in cells (Wunner et al., 2004; Israsena et al., 2009 ) and synthetic siRNA against RABV-N could reduce RABV multiplication in BHK-21 cells (Brandao et al., 2007) .

These findings have significant implications for the use of siRNA as therapeutic agent against RABV infection. However, to attain absolute protection other siRNA delivery methods (e.g., lentiviral), route (intravenous crossing blood-brain barrier), dose (single or multiple siRNAs) and time of therapeutic administration of siRNAs have to be carefully optimized in mice and in non-human primates before recommending for therapeutic use.",

HEK-293 cells were transiently co-transfected with target gene reporter plasmid (pDsRed-N or pDsRed-L) expressing RABV-N or L protein with C-terminal fusion with red fluorescent protein (N-RFP or L-RFP) and silencing constructs expressing siRNA (si-N or si-L or si-C). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were analyzed for RFP and EGFP expression. Cells with EGFP expression indicated presence of shRNA expressing plasmid while cells with RFP expression indicated RABV-N or RABV-L target reporter protein expression. Cells with an apparent absence of red fluorescence indicated gene silencing.",
