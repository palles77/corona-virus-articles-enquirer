Objective: To discover the utility of nasal dipsticks and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-DNA analysis in differentiating bacterial sinusitis from other causes of chronic cough and identifying pathogens from the nasal cavity. Method: We recruited 22 patients under 15 years of age with cough lasting longer than 4 weeks (group 1), 7 controls with allergic rhinitis (group 2), and 10 controls without respiratory symptoms (group 3). Based on symptoms, the results of nasal secretion assays, and nasal endoscopy, a diagnosis of clinical bacterial sinusitis was made. We identified potential pathogens by quantitative PCR of nasal secretions. Results: Group 1A (cough with clinical bacterial sinusitis n \u00bc 10): Eight (80%) patients had bacterial sinusitis associated with dominant potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB): Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Group 1B (cough without clinical bacterial sinusitis n \u00bc 12): None had dominant PPB. Group 2 (allergic rhinitis n \u00bc 7): None had dominant PPB. Group 3 (asymptomatic n \u00bc 10): None had dominant PPB. Twenty to 57% of all groups were colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. Fifty to 70% were colonized with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, and Dolosigranulum pigrum. Conclusion: In children with chronic cough, clinicians can utilize a simple and inexpensive nasal secretion dipstick assay for rapid diagnosis of sinusitis and identify PPB by DNA-PCR test for specific antibiotic treatment.",

            "text": "Chronic cough is defined as daily cough lasting 4 weeks or longer. 1 In children under 15 years of age, the causes of chronic cough include congenital defects, asthma, foreign body aspiration, infections, allergic diseases, gastroesophageal reflux, tumors, and other rare causes. 2 Among these, the most common etiologies include asthma, upper airway cough syndrome, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and nonspecific cough. 3, 4 The diagnosis of asthma or cough variant asthma can be made on the basis of NAEPP EPR-3 criteria and response to a bronchodilator. 5 Upper airway cough syndrome is a common entity, 3, 4 most likely triggered by postnasal drip due to either allergic and nonallergic rhinitis or bacterial and nonbacterial sinusitis. Protracted bacterial bronchitis is now recognized as one of the most common causes of chronic wet cough, especially in young children under 5 years of age. 6, 7 Once asthma and other conditions listed above are ruled out, upper airway cough syndrome or protracted bacterial bronchitis need to be considered as the most likely diagnoses. In approaching these clinical entities, our goal was to promptly detect the patients with bacterial sinusitis and the involved pathogens and to treat them with appropriate antibiotics. To this end, we decided to employ a novel method described by Huang and Small, 8 who reported that nasal secretion dipstick assay was highly correlated with sinus imaging studies and could be utilized for the diagnosis of sinusitis. We employed this simple approach for obvious reasons: speed, cost-effectiveness, and avoidance of radiation risk associated with sinus imaging studies. We also sought an equally simple and rapid method for identification of the pathogens for the suspected sinusitis. Positive findings in imaging studies of sinuses such as opacities and thickened lining indicate the presence of inflammation, possibly infection, but may have poor correlation with clinical disease 9,10 and do not reveal any information on etiologies. Although sinus puncture would yield such information, 11 this cannot be performed in most nonsurgical office settings. Studies have documented that nasal culture is a poor reflection of the microbes in the sinus cavity. 12 Therefore, we analyzed the microbes from the osteomeatal area utilizing a quantitative PCR method in an attempt to detect the pathogens that may cohabit both sinus and nasal cavities.",

Lee et al. reported a study of 31 adults with acute sinusitis in which 61% of nasopharyngeal and 48% of middle meatal samples grew PPB and that the concordance rate between the 2 sites was 84%. 18 We wanted to increase the sensitivity of microbial identification by employing DNA-based molecular diagnostics. Recent studies indicate that molecular diagnostic approaches yield much more accurate results with regard to diversity and quantities of microbes present in the sinus and nasal cavities. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Once the PCR results were reported, we classified these bacteria into different categories depending on their pathogenic potential. SP, HI, and MC were classified as PPB since these have been established as predominant pathogens for acute and subacute sinusitis by previous studies. 12, 24 SE is reported to be a commensal bacterium in the nasal cavity. 25 Although CP was characterized as pathogenic in some studies, 26 it was reported to be part of natural microbiota of the nares and throat. 27 DP has not been reported to cause sinusitis. 28 SA was classified separately because of its presence in the nasal and sinus cavities of asymptomatic subjects [29] [30] [31] and patient with sinusitis. 32, 33 Rhinovirus and Parainfluenza Virus were the only viruses identified and classified as potentially pathogenic viruses (PPV) since it is well known to cause upper respiratory symptoms. As seen in Tables 2 and 3 , the presence of PPB as a dominant species in the nasal cavities correlated with the clinical diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis (P < .002) indicating that dominance of microbes over others is an important element of pathogenesis. 34 The presence of a PPB in group 1B, 2, and 3 is not surprising because it is known to inhabit the nasal cavities of asymptomatic subjects. 17 The nondominance of these PPB along with other clinical features should enable the clinicians to separate these groups from the ones with bacterial sinusitis (1A). Group 1A may represent a combination of recurrent acute, subacute, and chronic sinusitis with bacterial infections. These PPB are also reported to be the most common pathogens associated with acute otitis media 33 and protracted bacterial bronchitis. 6, 7 It is possible that these patients may indeed have simultaneous sinusitis and protracted bacterial bronchitis since antibiotic treatment stops coughing in both entities. Such coexistence (via \"one airway\") needs to be explored in the future. In group 1B, chronic cough was most likely due to postnasal drip resulting from nonbacterial pathologies such as allergy (91% of the patients had allergen sensitization as shown in Table 1 ), viral infection, or chronic irritation. Although SA was present as dominant species in 2 patients in this group, its pathogenic role is doubtful due to their presence in control groups 2 and 3. Staphylococci were present in the sinus aspirates of acute, 29 chronic sinusitis, 14, 20, 21 and in the nasal cavities of those with CRS with nasal polyps, 16 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of sinusitis, especially in adults. 32, 33 But they were also shown to be present in the nasal cavities of 25% to 30% of asymptomatic subjects 30 in a competing relationship with PNPB, 22 and their presence may be a transient colonization rather than infection. 36 The presence of PNPB in all groups (Table 2 and Figure 1 ) is consistent with the recent studies revealing asymptomatic cohorts also carry diverse commensal bacteria in the nasal cavities including SA, SE, DP, and CP, and they maintain competing relationship among themselves. 20, 22 An intriguing finding was the presence of rhinovirus in all groups including asymptomatic controls, indicating that its colonization was not necessarily associated with clinical symptoms. In group 1A, 60% of the patients carried PPV and 40% carried both PPB and PPV indicating that both viruses and bacteria were coexistent. Rhinovirus, the most common viral pathogen in our study, was shown to increase adhesion of PPB to nasal epithelial cells at least 2-fold compared to uninfected controls. 37, 38 Conclusion We demonstrated, as others have, in children with chronic cough with sinusitis, microbial balance of the sinus cavity is disturbed and PPB takes the dominance. This can be detected by simple methods: dipstick assay and quantitative DNA-PCR test of the nasal secretion. Therefore, we recommend that clinicians utilize these methods as an alternative to imaging studies to make a diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis and offer a specific therapy for the pathogens in a rapid and accurate manner. Further studies are indicated to replicate these findings and refine the potential diagnostic capabilities of DNAbased methods for bacterial sinusitis and bronchitis.",
