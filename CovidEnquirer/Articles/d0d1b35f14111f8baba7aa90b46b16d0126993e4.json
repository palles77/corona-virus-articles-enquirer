Our objectives were to evaluate who is receiving funding from the NIH for topics relevant to voice disorders, and further describe temporal trends in grants awarded. Methods: The NIH RePORTER database was searched for grants relevant to voice disorders. Data were further organized by PI specialty, academic department, and funding totals. Furthermore, PI scholarly impact, as measured by the h-index, was calculated. Results: A total of 830 funded fiscal years (for 232 unique projects) totaling $203 million have supported projects examining voice disorders. A plurality of projects (32.8%) was awarded to PIs in otolaryngology departments, followed by 17.2% to speech pathology/communication sciences departments. Although year-to-year variation was noted, otolaryngology departments received approximately 15% of funding annually. Funded otolaryngologists had similar scholarly impact values to individuals in other specialties. Conclusions: The study of voice disorders involves an interdisciplinary approach, as PIs in numerous specialties receive NIH funding support. As they receive a considerable proportion of this funding and had similar h-indices compared to other specialties involved, otolaryngologists",

Nonetheless, funding opportunities have declined in recent years [14] , increasing the competition for these grants. In many cases, ability to procure external funding is necessary for the viability of a primary investigator (PI), as many institutions may be unable to provide significant funding via internal mechanisms. The management of patients with voice disorders is an inherently interdisciplinary undertaking, with close cooperation between a variety of professionals including (but not limited to) otolaryngologists and speech and language pathologists (SLP) being integral for appropriate diagnosis and management of patients. These lessons may certainly be carried over to the discipline of research, as close cooperation may be crucial, particularly in the current funding environment.

The NIH RePORTER system only reports specific dollar amounts for grants from 2000, and of these 232 projects, 167 (71.9%) had reported funding values. A plurality (32.8%) of 232 different grants was awarded to PIs in otolaryngology departments (Fig. 1) , with speech pathology/ communication departments being the next most common recipients (17.7%). When organizing awards by PI specialty, the majority (57.8%) of awards went to PIs with PhDs (excluding SLPs), followed by otolaryngologists and SLPs (Fig. 1) . Upon further examination of awards to otolaryngology departments, 37 of 76 projects (48.7%) had otolaryngologists as PIs (Table 1) , with the most common practitioners being non-fellowship-trained and pediatric otolaryngologists. Upon examination of temporal trends, year to year variation was noted, with a notable trend being a significant increase in funding from 2003 to 2012 among PIs in surgery departments ( Fig. 2A) . Nonetheless, the proportion of funding awarded to otolaryngology PIs remained relatively consistent during most years of this time period (Fig. 2B) . Upon examination of h-index of PIs receiving awards, otolaryngologists had statistically higher h-indices than SLPs (p =0.03) (Fig. 3) , while differences did not reach statistical significance compared to other specialties (p-values >0.05). Examination of aggregate NIH funding per PI organized by PI specialty is noted in Table 2 .",

            "text": "The study of laryngology and voice disorders is becoming an increasingly interdisciplinary field. Speech pathologists, PhD researchers, engineers, and of course otolaryngologists all contribute to this broad and ever-changing area of study. This can be partly attributed to new clinical practice guidelines, where clinicians are recommended to refer to voice therapy rather than prescribing antibiotics for treating routine voice disorders such as hoarseness [18] . Because of this interdisciplinary approach a healthy portion of the current research on voice disorders is being completed by speech pathologists, only occasionally in conjunction with otolaryngology departments. While PhD researchers and otolaryngologists comprise over 70% of NIH funded research on the topic, speech pathology research makes up over 13% of the total (Fig. 1B ). An increasingly collaborative approach between otolaryngologists and speech pathologists could lead further research opportunities, particularly in light of the current increasingly competitive funding atmosphere. Inevitably, this leads to a question: how impactful is the research done by speech pathologists compared to research headed by otolaryngologists? To quantitatively measure this, the authors used the h-index of each principal investigator. Upon comparison of speech pathologists to otolaryngologists that received NIH funding for their research, there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the h-indices of the two groups, with otolaryngologists having a significantly higher h-index than speech pathologists. While statistically significant, the practical significance of this result is questionable. Although this measure has utility as an objective indicator of the frequency at which an individual is having an impact upon scholarly discourse within his or her field, prior analyses have noted that scholarly impact values vary widely by factors such as size of one's field, as this may have a substantial impact on the size of audiences for a field's journals, ultimately affecting objective bibliometrics such as the h-index [10] . Laryngology as an established subspecialty is a relatively novel trend, and some have noted that the supply of fellowship-trained laryngologists remains insufficient for the purposes of training otolaryngology residents in the U.S. [19] This likely has contributed to the further proliferation of fellowship-training opportunities in recent years. A recent survey of otolaryngology residents revealed that less than half (41%) of respondents felt they had adequate operative laryngology instruction during their residency training, with approximately the same number reporting that they were comfortable providing laryngology care [20] . In light of these findings, only 6 of 42 (14.3%) projects with otolaryngologist PIs involved a fellowship-trained laryngologist (Table 1) . This suggests that there may be room for structured research opportunities in laryngology fellowships that encourage incorporation of basic and clinical research in subsequent careers. One way to encourage organization of these structured research opportunities may be to recruit and ultimately retain PhD researchers in otolaryngology departments. Over half of all NIH funded projects in voice disorders (58%) were granted to PhDs (Fig. 1) . By having PhD researchers in otolaryngology departments, residency trainees interested in voice disorders and laryngology fellows may have additional opportunities to produce meaningful and impactful research. Fundamentally, this can be achieved by receiving significant support from external funding organizations, most notably the NIH. Furthermore, this may also encourage the advancement of clinical research in the field of voice disorders due to the enhanced scholarly atmosphere. Our analysis notes a minority (6.6%) of funded projects in otolaryngology departments are headed by fellowship-trained laryngologists (Table 1) . It is only logical that if residency trainees are exposed to voice disorder research early in their training, there will be more interest and academic scholarship in the field later in their careers.",

The data were collected from the NIH RePORTER database system; funding totals in the database are only available for projects that occurred in 2000 or later. This comprised approximately 28% of the total, and included some projects that went on for many years that could potentially have been issued large NIH grants. In retrospect there may have been some limitations in our search criteria, and we could have possibly included such search broad terms as \"voice treatment\" or \"larynx\" to encompass the large amount of research being done under the topic of normal voice function. We did, however, want to stay true to our initial topic of focusing solely on voice disorders. Also, due to the large number of projects in our data analysis, it was difficult at times to group the projects into their proper specialties or categories. Many of the PIs were grouped into the \"unknown\" category by the NIH RePORTER database, and the authors used Internet searches to discover the specialties of these individuals. Certain principal investigators could not be properly categorized by Internet searches and were thus unfortunately placed into this \"unknown\" grouping, possibly clouding the true nature of categorical differences between specialties in funding. There was also the issue of not categorizing each grant into specific types, such as certain training grants given out by the NIH. This could be a direction for future research, looking into the need for laryngology fellowship programs to obtain these NIH training grants to further promote scholarship in the field of voice disorders.",

Working side-by-side with SLPs will help secure vital NIH funding and place otolaryngologists at the forefront of research that could be most beneficial to patients. The growing field of laryngology as a subspecialty could also stand to benefit from the increase hiring of PhDs in academic positions in departments.
