The latter are felt to be involved at various levels in the natural history of asthma. Acute viral infections (e.g. rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] , parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, and adenovirus) have been associated with asthma exacerbations both in children and in adults [1, 2] . Acute bacterial infections with atypical pathogens (such as Mycoplasma [M.] pneumoniae and Chlamydophila [C.] pneumoniae) have also been associated with acute asthma exacerbations, whereas chronic infection with these agents may play a role in persistent asthma. The mechanisms associating the presence of microorganisms in the airways and asthma has not been fully investigated, but likely involve increased susceptibility to infection in asthma, with the presence of infection augmenting inflammation in the lower airways.

This advice is based on the only two randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled, parallel-group trials testing routine antibiotic administration in addition to standard care to adult [6] or paediatric [7] populations with asthma exacerbations, that were published at the time of writing. Both of these rather old studies found no association between antibiotic treatment and improvement in any asthma outcome.

The authors suggested that the inflammatory response to chronic C. pneumoniae infection may interact with allergic inflammation to increase asthma symptoms, however, given our recent knowledge [10, 11] , it is also possible that chronic C. pneumoniae infection is a marker of increased susceptibility to infection, and therefore to infection-associated exacerbations.",

A biologic basis for increased susceptibility to atypical bacterial infections however, is only just beginning to emerge. Studies in mouse models of C. pneumoniae pneumonitis revealed dramatically increased pathology in IFN-\u2425R-/mice [59] and more recently it has been shown that IFN-\u2425 secretion by bone-marrow-derived macrophages controls infection and importantly, that this is IFN-\u2424\u2423 dependent [60, 61] . The recent discovery of the type III () IFNs and the realisation that they have almost identical properties in innate immunity to the type I (\u2423\u2424) IFNs, coupled with the demonstration that individuals with asthma have deficient type III IFN production in macrophages in response to both viral and bacterial stimuli [11] , provides an important likely explanation for increased susceptibility to atypical bacterial infection in asthma. Further study to determine whether macrophages from individuals with asthma also have deficient type I IFN production in response to bacterial stimuli, and to determine whether type III IFNs are also important in host defence against C. pneumoniae infections, and both type I and type III IFNs against M. pneumoniae, will be required to confirm this theory.",

The mechanisms regulating the possible role of atypical pathogens in causing acute or sustaining persistent airway inflammation have recently been reviewed [53, 62] .

Similar improvements were not observed in those receiving placebo, or in those receiving macrolide therapy but with-out evidence of infection, suggesting that the treatment effect was related to antimicrobial, not anti-inflammatory activity. Mycoplasma and Chlamydia organisms were still present in the airways of seven asthmatic subjects after treatment with clarithromycin, and two subjects had positive PCR findings after treatment only. The authors suggested that macrolides, being bacteriostatic, had difficulty in eradicating these organisms and, moreover, that this difficulty may result in a chronic state of infection/colonisation. Experimental evidence for this suggestion may be derived from a study by Kutlin et al. [67] testing prolonged treatment with azithromycin, clarithromycin or levofloxacin on C. pneumoniae in a continuous-infection model. They observed that 30-day treatment with these agents at concentrations comparable to those achieved in the epithelial lining fluid reduced but did not eliminate C. pneumoniae in continuously infected HEp-2 cells. These data suggest that the dosage and duration of antibiotic therapy currently being used may not be sufficient to eradicate a putative chronic C. pneumoniae infection.",

In the first month, clinical success was significantly more frequent among the patients who had received azithromycin and this difference was significant only for the group of patients with serology and/or PCR evidence of atypical bacterial infections in nasopharyngeal specimens, however, this study was not placebo controlled and may therefore be subject to bias.",

Assessment of C. pneumoniae and/or M. pneumoniae infection by culture, serology and PCR was included [70] . Compared with placebo, telithromycin-treated patients had clinically relevant and significantly greater reductions in asthma symptoms over the treatment period, larger improvements from baseline to the end of treatment in all PFTs, including FEV 1 , a faster median time to 50% reduction in symptom severity (5 days versus 8 days), and a greater proportion of completely symptom-free days during the treatment period (16% versus 8%). This study demonstrated statistically significant and clinically substantial benefits associated with ketolide antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbations of asthma. In this population 61% of patients had evidence of C. pneumoniae and/or M. pneumoniae infection and the effect of telithromycin on FEV 1 was statistically significant in patients with documented infection at baseline and not in those patients without evidence of infection. However, the magnitudes of treatment effects on FEV 1 were similar in the infection-positive and -negative groups, and the lack of statistical significance in the latter could simply relate to the smaller numbers of patients in that group. Further, there were no differences between infection-positive and -negative groups in terms of the other study outcomes, so that the mechanisms of benefit remain unclear.",

Serology may be useful retrospectively in defining acute infection if good paired serum samples are available, however, it will clearly not be useful in making acute treatment decisions unless decisions can be made on a single acute sample. The TEL-ICAST study suggested a single estimation of IgM [70] may be useful, but further studies are clearly required to confirm this. Serology certainly has a lower specificity and sensitivity when applied to chronic infection, as most adults have been previously exposed and high IgG levels are therefore a poor indication of current bacterial presence. It is possible though, that IgA may prove a more useful assessment than IgG [68] . Molecular biology techniques are more specific and sensitive but should be used on the right sample. Applying a PCR on sputum is probably better than using a pharyngeal swab specimen in acute infection/reactivation, but obtaining good-quality samples is difficult [70] , and sputum contains PCR inhibitors, so appropriate processing is required. Sputum PCR has not yet been studied in the context of chronic infection. PCR of peripheral blood mononuclear cells is so far the best biological approach for detection of chronic infection, but this method does not confirm the site of infection. In addition, molecular methods are not standardised and a great deal of further work is required before they could be considered clinically useful.",

Exacerbation frequency is also an important clinical outcome that has not been studied in chronic asthma. In terms of acute exacerbations studies, again in-clinic pulmonary function tests and patient-reported symptom scores are the only outcomes that have proven useful in the only placebo-controlled study reported to date [70] .

It is also likely that chronic persistent infection with and/or frequent reactivation of these agents may contribute to ongoing inflammation in the airways and possibly therefore to long-term remodelling. However, definitive demonstration of a causal association between atypical bacterial infection and asthma is still lacking. It may be that some patients with asthma (particularly in the setting of impaired innate immune responses) are more prone to infection with these agents, and the increased burden of infection may contribute to disease severity and progression. In vitro studies have identified a number of mechanisms associated with chronic C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae atypical bacterial infection that may contribute to maintaining chronic airway inflammation. Both bacterial elements activate transcription factors, thus priming most cellular elements in bronchial tissue (epithelium, endothelium, monocytes/macrophages, smooth muscle cells), resulting in a cascade of cytokine release and adhesion molecule upregulation, which favours cellular influx into the airways, persistent inflammation, and airway remodelling.",

Data from the limited number of studies carried out so far indicate that treatment with macrolides is associated with some benefit in both clinical and functional terms, although perhaps only in patients with documented atypical infection and provided that treatment be prolonged for several weeks. A key question is whether even prolonged antibiotic treatment is capable of truly eradicating C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae or rather simply temporarily suppresses the infection, which is then refuelled by long-standing reservoirs.
