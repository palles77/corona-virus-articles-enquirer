The states from which samples had been submitted were Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio. Among those samples, 435 were selected to be tested for the presence of PorCoV HKU15. A real-time reverse transcription PCR assay targeting the membrane protein gene was used to identify PorCoV HKU15. Samples with a cycle threshold value of <35 were considered positive on the basis of validation data using the cloned membrane protein gene (data not shown). Of the 435 samples, 109 (25%) from 9 states (all states mentioned above, excluding Maryland) were positive for PorCoV HKU15 by real-time reverse transcription PCR (Figure) . Of those 109 samples, 19 (17%) were also positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. This result suggests that PorCoV HKU15 is prevalent among pig populations in the major pig-producing US states.",

Furthermore, all of the isolates share high nucleotide similarity (98.9%-99.2%) with the 2 PorCoV HKU15 strains in GenBank, HKU15-155 and HKU15-44. A phylogenetic tree constructed by using the entire sequence showed that all PorCoV HKU15 strains from the United States clustered together in 1 clade of the genus Deltacoronavirus with HKU15-155 and HKU15-44 (online Technical Appendix Figure, panel A, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/ article/20/9/14-0756-Techapp1.pdf). This finding indicates that 1 genotype of PorCoV HKU15 is currently circulating in multiple US states. This result was further supported by phylogenetic trees constructed by using the full-length amino acids of spike and nucleocapsid proteins (online Technical Appendix Figure, panels B, C). Because of limitation of the samples received, only a partial genome sequence was determined for strain MN3092 from Minnesota. However, on the basis of the spike and nucleocapsid protein sequence analyses, it is highly likely that the entire genome of the Minnesota strain is genetically identical to that of the other 8 strains (online Technical Appendix Figure, panels B, C).",
