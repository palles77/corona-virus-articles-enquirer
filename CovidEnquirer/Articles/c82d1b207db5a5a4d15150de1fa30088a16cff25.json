            "text": "The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new type of coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other coronaviruses and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models. The spike protein, a main surface antigen of SARS-CoV, is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design. Overlapping peptides were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitopes in mice immunized with vectors encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein. CD8 T-cell responses were mapped to two H-2 b -restricted epitopes (S436 -443 and S525 -532) and one H-2 d -restricted epitope (S366 -374). The identification of these epitopes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in murine models of SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity of spike protein in the context of replication-defective human and simian adenoviral vaccine carriers. The optimized recombinant adenoviral vaccine vectors encoding spike can generate robust antigenspecific cellular immunity in mice and may potentially be useful for control of SARS-CoV infection. D",

The case fatality rate has been as high as 15% for patients younger than 60 years old and can be higher than 50% for patients 60 years or older. Nearly 40% of patients developed respiratory failure that required assisted ventilation (De Groot, 2003) . The severe morbidity and mortality associated with SARS make it imperative that effective means to prevent and treat the disease be developed and evaluated, especially since it is not known whether the virus will exhibit a seasonal pattern or whether it will be reintroduced into the human population through animal reservoirs, or laboratory accidences, or acts of terrorism.",

No conclusive information is available on the immune correlates of protection to SARS in patients. However, it has been reported that antibodies against SARS-CoV were detected in patients infected with SARS . Recently, using pseudotyped lentiviral particles bearing the SARS-CoV spike protein, it has been shown that spike-mediated infection could be inhibited by sera from SARS patients, demonstrating that spike is a target for neutralizing antibodies (Hofmann et al., 2004) . In addition, two identified CD8 T-cell epitopes in SARS-CoV spike protein have been shown to elicit specific T-cell responses in HLA-A2+ SARS-CoV-infected patients (Wang et al., 2004) . Therefore, we initially focused on SARS-CoV spike protein as the target antigen for our vaccine development.",

However, for the early stage of product evaluation, a small animal model, such as mice, would be very useful. We (Hogan et al., 2004) and others (Subbarao et al., 2004) have shown that SARS-CoV replicates in mice although the infection is self-limited. To study antigen-specific immune responses in mice, MHC Irestricted CD8 T-cell epitopes need to be identified. Vectors based on replication-defective adenoviruses are capable of high-level gene transfer and activation of T and B cells to the transgene product (van Ginkel et al., 1997; Yang et al., 1996) . These properties have been exploited in the development of genetic subunit vaccines (Sullivan et al., 2000; Xiang et al., 1996) . Therefore, several versions of replication-defective adenoviral vectors expressing spike protein were created to induce spike-specific T cell responses in mice and to screen for CD8 T-cell epitopes using an overlapping peptide library spanning the entire spike protein in IFN-g ELISPOT and intracellular IFN-g staining assays. Here, we report the detailed mapping of both H-2 b -and H-2 d -restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes from codon-optimized spike protein.",

Splenocytes were harvested at 8 days after immunization and subjected to IFN-g ELISPOT assay with pools of overlapping peptides from spike protein. Of all peptide pools screened, pools 9, 11, and 18 showed specific IFN-g responses in C57BL/6. The remaining pools, as exemplified by pool 5, showed no specific response (Fig. 1A) . Pools 9 and 11 were selected for mapping the individual peptide(s) responsible for stimulating IFN-g expressing T cells. Peptide 87 (TSTGNYNY-KYRYLRH, corresponding to S431 -445) and peptide 88 (YNYKYRYLRHGKLRP, corresponding to S436 -450) within pool 9 and peptide 105 (KNQCVNFNFNGLTGT, corresponding to S521 -535) and peptide 106 (NFNFN-GLTGTGVLTP, corresponding to S526 -540) within pool 11 were identified as the major positive peptides responsible for specific stimulation of T cells to produce IFN-g (Fig. 1B) . Based on the SYFPEITHI algorithm (Rammensee et al., 1999) , several potential CD8 T-cell epitopes for SARS-CoV spike protein in C57BL/6 mice were identified. Table 1 showed their sequences, positions, and scores. Indeed, YNYKYRYL (S436 -443) completely present in peptides 87 and 88 was predicted to have strong binding affinity for H2-K b ; while VNFNFNGL (S525 -532) completely present in peptide 105 and partially present in peptide 106 was predicted to have weak binding affinity for H2-K b . Since ELISPOT assay cannot readily distinguish antigen-specific CD4 T-cell responses from antigenspecific CD8 T-cell responses, the immunized splenocytes were further subjected to intracellular IFN-g staining after stimulating in vitro with peptides 87 and 105 (Fig. 2) . Subsequently, the predicted optimal CD8 T-cell epitopes, YNYKYRYL resided in peptide 87 and VNFNFNGL resided in peptide 105, were synthesized and used to stimulate immunized splenocytes in vitro for IFN-g secretion (Fig. 2) . As predicted, YNYKYRYL and peptides 87 gave much stronger CD8 T-cell responses than VNFNFNGL and peptides 105. Furthermore, optimal epitopes, YNYKYRYL and VNFNFNGL, were able to induce IFN-g responses in CD8 T cells either as effectively as or more effectively than their parental 15 mers, respectively. In conclusion, a single administration of a replication-defective human adenoviral vaccine vector encoding codon-optimized spike can generate strong spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses. We also identified two optimal CD8 T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV spike in C57BL/6 mice.",

We focused on pools 8 and 9 because of the stronger responses observed with these pools.

In contrast, spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses were observed when AdC7.CMVnSpike vector was used to immunize C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 8) . However, the magnitude of spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses was much lower than that observed in mice immunized with AdHu5.CMVnSpike vector (Fig. 8) . In order to further improve the immunogenicity of spike protein delivered by the simian adenoviral vaccine carrier, AdC7.CAG2nSpike vector was created.

Expression of spike protein in Ad vector-infected 293T cells was examined by Western blot analysis and the bands representing spike protein were quantified by Image-Quant5.1. Forty-three-fold increase of protein expression was achieved when CAG2 promoter, instead of CMV promoter, was used in the simian adenoviral C7 vector (Fig.   9 , lanes 4 and 6), while 7-fold increase of protein expression was achieved when codon optimization of spike protein was applied (Fig. 9, lanes 5 and 6) . Overall, the results supported that the enhanced immunogenicity of spike in mice injected with AdHu5.CMVnSpike and AdC7.CAG2nSpike vaccine vectors (Fig. 8) indeed correlated to high expression of spike protein in cells infected with these vectors.",

More significantly, in the postmortem lung tissue samples from patients who died from SARS, multinucleate giant cells of macrophage and epithelial origins have been observed within the damaged alveoli (Nicholls et al., 2003) . In addition, CD8 T-cell responses are necessary for clearance of other CoVs, such as mouse hepatitis virus (Sussman et al., 1989; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990) .

In this study, we have identified two octamers (S436-443 and S525 -532) as H-2 b -restricted CD8 T-cell epitopes and one nonamer (S366 -374) as an H-2 d -restricted CD8 T-cell epitope. In C57BL/6 mice, one epitope is more dominant than the other in immunized mice. The strength of these epitopes appeared to correlate with the binding affinity to H2-K b predicted by SYFPEITHI algorithm. In the preliminary study, splenocytes were collected from C57BL/6 mice immunized with AdC7.CAG2nSpike vector and in vitro cultured in the presence of the dominant H-2 brestricted CD8 T-cell epitope for a week. Subsequently, the cultured splenocytes were subjected to ELISPOT assay stimulated with MC57SV cells (H-2D b , a cell line derived from B6 mice) previously infected with either AdHu5.Null or AdHu5.CMVnSpike vector. The initial results indicated that cultured splenocytes were able to induce higher level of IFN-g response after stimulated with AdHu5.CMVnSpike vector-infected MC57SV cells than after stimulated with AdHu5.Null vector-infected MC57SV cells. These data suggested that T cells raised to the epitope were able to recognize cells expressing the spike protein and that the identified CD8 epitope is naturally processed and presented by cells. Currently, additional experiments are underway to address this issue more thoroughly.",

CoV exhibits a similar genome structure, it is only distantly related to known CoVs and Fmost like_ Group 2 CoVs, which includes bovine, murine, and human viruses (Snijder et al., 2003) . The most commonly studied coronavirus is mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), in part because the natural host for this infection, the mouse, is more easily managed in the laboratory. Two spike-specific CD8 T-cell epitopes (dominant S510 -518 and subdominant S598-605) were identified in MHV-infected C57BL/6 mice (Bergmann et al., 1996; Castro and Perlman, 1995) , while no spikespecific CD8 T-cell epitope has been recognized in MHVinfected BALB/c mice. The dominant S510 -518 epitope is located in a hypervariable region of spike protein that appears to be readily deleted without loss of viability of MHV (Parker et al., 1989) . In contrast, it was impossible to recover infectious virus with mutations in the subdominant S598 -605 epitope (personal communication, M.M. Chua and S.R. Weiss). Examination of SARS-CoV spike sequence reveals that three CD8 T-cell epitopes are present in the S1 domain of the spike protein. Specifically, the dominant CD8 T-cell epitope in C57BL/6 (S436 -443) and the CD8 T-cell epitope in BALB/c (S366 -374) both reside in the minimal region of S1 required for interaction with its cellular receptor (Babcock et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004) . Several spike-specific CD4 T-cell epitopes have also been reported in MHV-infected mice (Heemskerk et al., 1995; Xue and Perlman, 1997) . CD4 T cells are needed to help CD8 cells for viral clearance (Stohlman et al., 1998; Sussman et al., 1989; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990) . In this study, we clearly showed that both peptide 87 and peptide 88 were able to specifically stimulate immunized CD4 T cells to produce IFN-g in vitro. However, the exact sequences of CD4 T-cell epitope in the 431 -450 region of spike protein remain to be further elucidated.",

            "text": "The first step in designing a genetic vaccine is to enhance the intrinsic immunogenicity of the selected target gene. In this study, we demonstrated that codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity of spike protein in replication-defective human and simian adenoviral vaccine vectors. We showed that the expression of spike protein in vitro was greatly increased by expression cassette optimization. This provided useful information for developing spike-based SARS-CoV genetic vaccines. More importantly, this may provide us a platform to quickly generate genetic vaccine vectors based on simian adenovirus. Namely, CAG2 but not CMV promoter should be used in simian adenoviral vaccine vector. Currently, we are testing this hypothesis with other viral antigens. Since the CMV promoter has been widely used in human adenoviral vectors, it is surprising to see the inferior performance of CMV promoter in simian adenoviral vector. One possibility is that certain viral sequences only present in simian adenoviral vector have negative effects on CMV promoter activity. The other possibility is that certain inflammatory cytokines induced by simian adenoviral vector may inhibit CMV promoter activity.",

            "text": "Recently, a strategy involving priming with DNA vaccine and boosting with adenoviral vaccine vectors, each expressing a similar antigen, has resulted in the generation of unparalleled levels of specific immunity and afforded protection against infectious agents in animal models (Shiver et al., 2002; Sullivan et al., 2000) . Nevertheless, DNA vaccines have performed poorly in clinical trials so far (MacGregor et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2001) , and it is thus uncertain whether DNA vaccine prime followed by adenoviral vaccine vector boost will be as efficacious in humans as in preclinical experimental animal studies. Therefore, we developed an additional replication-defective adenoviral vaccine vector of chimpanzee origin to increase our repertoire of vaccine carriers that can be given sequentially Pinto et al., 2003 Pinto et al., , 2004 Reyes-Sandoval et al., 2004; Roy et al., 2004; Xiang et al., 2002 Xiang et al., , 2003a Xiang et al., , 2003b Xiang et al., , 2003c . The toxicity of adenoviral vectors in vivo is directly related to the dose of injection. Therefore, a major benefit of prime/boost strategy is the potential to significantly reduce the dose for immunization in order to achieve a high level of immune responses. In this study, we showed that both AdHu5.CMVnSpike and AdC7.CAG2nSpike vaccine vectors could induce robust spike-specific CD8 T-cell responses in immunized mice alone. Currently, we are studying whether strong CD8 T-cell responses can be achieved when mice were primed and boosted with these heterologous adenoviral vaccine vectors at a much lower dose.",
