The highest disease burdens are in sub-Saharan Africa (21.4% of global total) and India (20.9%) [1] . The most common cause of community acquired respiratory infections are respiratory viruses [2] and up to one-third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) among hospitalized adults are viral in aetiology [3] . Several outbreaks of respiratory viral infections in hospitalised patients have also been reported [4] . The recent influenza pandemic caused by the 2009 California H1N1strain increased awareness of the importance of influenza among hospitalized patients but there are few reports on other influenza strains and other non influenza respiratory viral infections in hospitalised patients 6 . There is also unnecessary antibiotic use in the management of respiratory viral infections on account of poor diagnostics for viruses and concern about bacterial etiologies, leading to antibiotic resistance in bacteria [6] .",

The commonest comorbidity was diabetes mellitus in 17 patients (42.5%) followed by chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 9 (22.5%) and drug induced (prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in various combinations) T cell immunosuppression in 8 (20%) patients. In 13 (32.5%) patients there were no co-morbidities. The most common respiratory virus was rhino virus in 9 (22.5%) patients followed by influenza H3/H3N2 in 7 (17.5%), H1N1 in 6 (15%) and RSV in 4 (10%). All strains of influenza taken together constituted 19 (47.5%) patients. Mixed infections were found in 5 (12.5%) patients. Most cases of influenza were seen during November ( Fig. 1) which coincides with the Northeast monsoon in Chennai and surrounding areas. Two peaks of HRV were seen in March and June. Fever was the most common clinical feature seen in 29 (72.5%) patients followed by cough in 24 (60%), rhinorrhea in 23 (57.5%) and dyspnea in 23 (57.5%). A history of contact with another person with a respiratory virus like illness was present in 22 (55%) patients. Chest X Ray was normal in 12 (30%) of the subjects and other subjects had varied findings as summarised in Table 2 . Patients infected with HRV had dyspnea at presentation in 88.9%, higher than with other viruses. H3N2, Influenza A and HMPV tended to infect patients older than 60 years. Patients infected with H3N2 and H1N1 required mechanical ventilation in more than 50% of cases. Four out of 5 deaths in the study group had infection with the influenza (H3N2, H1N1, influenza B) viruses. Twenty percent of patients infected with the influenza group of viruses required mechanical ventilation compared with only 5% of patients with other viruses, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.02). Of 40 patients studied, 33 were started on antibiotics before the receipt of respiratory viral diagnostics. After the diagnosis of the viral infection, antibiotics were completely stopped in 10 (30.3%) patients and de-escalated to a narrower spectrum agent in another 10 (30.3%) patients. The remaining 13 patients (39.4%), all >55 years of age, were continued on original or escalated to broad spectrum antibiotics due to suspected or confirmed concomitant bacterial infections, 5 of these developed ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and 1 had bacteremia due to unknown source. Seven out of these 13 patients were either organ transplant recipients or were getting immunosuppression. No patient whose antibiotics were de-escalated died, whereas there were 5 deaths in patients in whom de-escalation was not done (Table 3 ). Total 5 patients had VAP. Four out of 5 deaths were due to VAP and cause of death of the 5th patient could not be identified. All the 5 patients had some comorbidity (4 had DM and 1 was COPD).",

In our study most patients were above the age of 55, with males being more commonly affected than females (70% and 30% respectively). In a third of our patients there were no comorbidities noted; the commonest co-morbidities in the remainder were diabetes and CKD, and up to 20% were immunocompromised by medications. Respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients tend to be severe requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressors support in significant proportions of patients [10, 11] .

This is consistent with the data published by Walker et al and Seo et al. [10, 11] . Influenza strains other than H1N1 were in fact more common than H1N1 influenza, highlighting that there are many patients who may potentially benefit from oseltamivir or other antivirals.

In our study a total of 33 out of 40 patients were started on antibiotics at presentation: after diagnosis of the respiratory virus, antibiotics were de-escalated or stopped in a total of 20 (71.4%) patients. Outcome was good in all 20 patients. Our study signifies the importance of diagnosing respiratory virus and safety of de-escalation of antibiotics without adverse outcomes. There were a significantly increased number of deaths in patients in whom antibiotics were not de-escalated, this may reflect confounding factors like age of the patient, comorbidities, severity of disease at presentation and hospital acquired infections. Nevertheless our data support the practice of stopping or de-escalating antibiotics when viral pneumonia is confirmed. There is increasing data to suggest that hospital acquired pneumonia due to respiratory viruses are common, usually due to cross transmission between patients, and mandate early diagnosis and droplet isolation to prevent outbreaks [16] . Prior to the introduction of multiplex PCR for diagnosis of respiratory viruses, droplet isolation used to be done only in those patients in whom H1N1 PCR was positive: as only 6(15%) patients had H1N1 infection, there would have been a potential risk for spread of infection in the remaining 85%. With the introduction of multiplex PCR now droplet isolation could be extended for patients infected with all of the respiratory viruses.",

Patients usually present with fever, cough, a household contact with respiratory symptoms and have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Diagnosis facilitates early use of antivirals and droplet isolation, resulting in better patient outcome and prevention of cross-transmission of viruses in the hospital. Antibiotic de-escalation for patients with viral pneumonia would reduce costs and may slow development of antibiotic. A policy of looking for influenza H1N1 only may result in missing as many as 85% of respiratory viruses, including other influenza viruses which may respond to antivirals, and policy makers and clinicians should switch to a policy of routinely ordering multiplex PCR in the appropriate clinical setting for a viral pneumonia, especially when outside the peak influenza season.",
