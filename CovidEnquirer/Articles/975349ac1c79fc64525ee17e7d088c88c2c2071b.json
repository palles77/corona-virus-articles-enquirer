R provides information about outbreak control and predicted final size. Directly estimating R is difficult, while r can often be estimated from incidence data. These quantities are linked by the generation interval -the time between when an individual is infected by an infector, and when that infector was infected. It is often infeasible to obtain the exact shape of a generation-interval distribution, and to understand how this shape affects estimates of R. We show that estimating generation interval mean and variance provides insight into the relationship between R and r. We use examples based on Ebola, rabies and measles to explore approximations based on gamma-distributed generation intervals, and find that use of these simple approximations are often sufficient to capture the r-R relationship and provide robust estimates of R.",

As it is a unitless quantity, it does not, however, contain information about time. Hence, another important quantity is the population-level rate of spread, r. The initial rate of spread can often be measured robustly early in an epidemic, since the number of incident cases at time t is expected to follow i(t) \u2248 i(0) exp(rt). The rate of growth can also be described using the \"characteristic time\" of exponential growth C = 1/r. This is closely related to, and simpler mathematically than, the more commonly used doubling time (given by T 2 = ln(2)C \u2248 0.69C).",

Generation interval distributions are typically inferred from contact tracing, sometimes in combination with clinical data [7, 20, 16] . Generation interval distributions can be difficult to ascertain empirically [29, 8] , and the generation-function approach depends on an entire distribution. Multiple studies have explored how general-interval distributions affect the r-R relationship (summarized in Table 1 ). However, the use of an entire distribution makes it difficult to determine which features of the distributions are essential to connect measurements of the rate of spread r, with the reproductive number, R.

We explore the qualitative relationship between generation time, initial rate of spread r, and initial reproductive number R using means, variance measures and gamma approximations. We show that summarizing generation-interval distributions using moments provides biological explanations that unify previous findings. We further discuss the generality of the gamma approximation and provide examples of its relevance in using realistic epidemiological parameters from previous outbreaks. By doing so, we shed light on the underpinnings of the relationship between r and R, and on the factors underlying its robustness and its practical use when data on generation intervals is limited or hard to obtain. In this section, we introduce an analytical framewok, and recapitulate previous work relating growth rate r and reproductive number R. These two quantities are linked by the generation-interval distribution, which describes the interval between the time an individual becomes infected and the time that they infect another individual. In particular, if R is known, a shorter generation interval means a faster epidemic (larger r). Conversely (and perhaps counter-intuitively), if r is known, then shorter disease generations imply a lower value of R, because more individual generations are required to realize the same population spread of disease [11, 32] (see Fig. 1 ). The generation-interval distribution can be defined using a renewalequation approach. A wide range of disease models can be described using the model [15, 10, 36, 1, 44, 37] :",

We expect short intervals to be particularly important in driving the speed of the epidemic, and therefore in determining the relationship between r and R. We can address this problem by estimating gamma parameters formally using a maximum-likelihood fit to the pseudo-realistic generation intervals.

The initial value of R for an outbreak is often estimated by estimating the initial exponential rate of growth, and then using a generation-interval distribution to relate the two quantities [44, 39, 28, 40] . However, detailed estimates of the full generation interval are difficult to obtain, and the link between uncertainty in the generation interval and uncertainty in estimates of R are often unclear. Here we introduced and analyzed a simple framework for estimating the relationship between R and r, using only the estimated mean and CV of the generation interval. The framework is based on the gamma distribution. We used three disease examples to test the robustness of the framework. We also compared estimates based directly on estimated mean and variance of of the generation interval to estimates based on maximum-likelihood fits. The gamma approximation for calculating R from r was introduced by [29] , and provides estimates that are simpler, more robust, and more realistic than those from normal approximations (see Appendix). Here, we presented the gamma approximation in a form conducive to intuitive understanding of the relationship between speed, r, and strength, R (See Fig. 2) . In doing so, we explained the general result that estimates of R increase with mean generation time, but decrease with variation in generation times [44, 46, 37] . We also provided mechanistic interpretations: when generation intervals are longer, more infection is needed per generation (larger R) in order to produce 15 .

As early infections contribute most to growth of an epidemic, faster exponential growth is expected for a given value of R. Thus a higher value of R will be needed to match a given value of r.",

In particular, this framework has potential advantages for understanding the likely effects of parameter changes, and also for parameter estimation with uncertainty: since R can be estimated from three simple quantities (\u1e20, \u03ba and r), it should be straightforward to propagate uncertainty from estimates of these quantities to estimates of R.",

During the outbreak, [47] used a generation-interval argument to show that neglecting the effects of post-burial transmission would be expected to lead to underestimates of R. Our generation interval framework provides a clear interpretation of this result: as long as post-burial transmission tends to increase generation intervals, it should result in higher estimates of R for a given estimate of r.

When sample size is limited, estimates using MLE tend to be substantially close to the known true values in these experiments. As we increase sample size, our estimates become narrower. We also find that using the gamma approximated speed-strength relationship gives narrower estimates than the two naive estimates even when the sample size is extremely small (n = 10).
