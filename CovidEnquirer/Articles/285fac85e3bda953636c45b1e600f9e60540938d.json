The expression of plant flavonoids is partly regulated by fermentation. Therefore, we studied the effects of fermentation on H. cordata in order to identify the strains present during the fermentation process, and to determine whether fermented H. cordata could be used as a probiotic. Our results showed that all 6 of the bacterial strains isolated from fermented H. cordata (FHC) belonged to the genus Bacillus. As expected, fermenting H cordata also increased the flavonoid content as increases were observed in the levels of rutin, quercitrin, and quercetin. To test the effects of fermentation, we treated LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells with non-fermented H. cordata extracts (HCE) or FHC extracts (FHCE). Compared to the HCE-treated cells, the FHCE-treated cells showed increased viability. No cytotoxic effects were detected in the FHCE-treated groups in the 2 cell lines used in the study, namely, RAW264.7 and RBL-2H3. FHCE-treated HepG2 cells showed decreased growth, compared to HCE-treated HepG2 cells. These results indicate that the fermented H. cordata predominantly contained Bacillus strains. Furthermore, FHCE are able to prevent LPS-induced inflammatory effects and inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells.",

            "text": "The chemical components of H. cordata comprise 6 major types: volatile oils, flavonoids, alkaloids, fatty acids, sterols, and polyphenolic acids (Wu et al., 2009; Meng et al., 2009) . Our group recently demonstrated microbial fermentation as a promising alternative source for many flavonoid molecules, including anthocyanins, flavones, and flavanones (Leonar et al., 2006) . Consequently, there is growing interest in the fermented products of herbal plants. Specifically, fermentation can improve the nutraceutical value of a product by breaking down certain undesirable compounds and inducing effective microbial conversion (Oboh et al., 2008) . Currently, most industries employ the time-consuming traditional fermentation method, which uses sugar in its native form and requires 2 to 3 years for completion. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methodologies that would allow plants to be fermented using specific microorganisms at a large scale, over shorter durations. To compensate for the shortcomings in the conventional fermentation process and produce homogeneous fermented products, bacterial strains were identified and isolated from traditionally fermented H. cordata extracts (FHCE), produced using the conventional fermentation process. Further, we aimed to compare the effects of FHCE and H. cordata extracts (HCE) by using the aforementioned optimal fermentation conditions on the alleviation of oxidative stress. In this study, 6 Bacillus strains were isolated from FHCE. They were confirmed to belong to the genus Bacillus, and were identified as B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum FZB42 T , B. licheniformis ATCC 14580 T , B. aerius 24K T , B. methylotrophicus CBMB205 T , B. safensis FO-036b T , B. sonorensis NRRL B-23154 T , with ~99% similarity. The use of viable spores of Bacillus as a probiotic supplement raises some concerns, including safety. Several Bacillus species used as animal feed supplements, probiotics, plant protection products, or seed-coating agents are also known to cause food poisoning (Gagg\u00eca et al., 2010) . Using fermentation, the flavonoid content can be increased, thereby increasing the antioxidant activity.",

The phylogenetic tree, which was constructed on the basis of 16S rDNA sequences, is shown in Fig. 1 . The 16S rRNA gene domains of the strains 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 consisted of 1388 bp, 564 bp, 556 bp, 1441 bp, 556 bp, and 522 bp, respectively (Fig. 2) .

The different strains were designated as SMh-1 to SMh-6. Thus, all the species isolated from these extracts belonged to the Bacillus genus.

(2009) have showed that fermentation increases the flavonoid content (Philip et al., 2009) . FHCE and HCE were examined for their flavonoid composition by using HPLC. Individual constituents were identified by comparing their peaks, UV spectra, and retention times, with those of the corresponding reference standards (Fig. 2) . The percentage of each flavonoid was estimated using a calibration curve. The flavonoids present in the FHCE and HCE were rutin (2.1 mg/100 g, 1.1 mg/100 ml), quercitrin (16.6 mg/ 100 g, 11.8 mg/100 g), and quercetin (0.5 mg/100 g, 0.2 mg/ 100 g). The contents of rutin, quercitrin, and quercetin increased in the FHCE by 1.9-fold, 1.4-fold, and 2.5-fold, respectively, compared to the HCE. The increase in the flavonoid content of FHCE was attributed to the change in the organic content, which was due to fermentation carried out by the Bacillus strains identified in the FHCE. This broad spectrum of nutraceuticals with different characteristics allowed a comprehensive assessment of the cytotoxicity associated with these flavonoids as well as a comparison between the different cytotoxicity assays and the different fish cell lines, namely, RBL-2H3 and RAW264.7. To determine the cell viability of RAW264.7 macrophages and RBL-2H3 cells that had been treated with HCE and FHCE, we used an MTT assay. In this assay, a mitochondrial enzyme in living cells, succinate dehydrogenase, cleaves the tetrazolium ring, converting the MTT to an insoluble purple formazan. Therefore, the amount of formazan produced is directly proportional to the number of viable cells. The cytotoxic effects of FHCE and HCE on the 2 kinds of cells, namely, RAW264.7 and RBL-2H3, were studied at different concentrations, i.e., 1000 \u00b5g/ml, 100 \u00b5g/ml, and 10 \u00b5g/ ml. Cell viability was not affected by FHCE and HCE at any of these concentrations. Thus, FHCE and HCE are not cytotoxic.",

In our study, LPS treatment decreased cell viability with increasing doses, indicating that LPS has dose-dependent effects on cytotoxicity. We evaluated the protective effects of FHCE and HCE by testing the in vitro cell viability of RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS (LD 50 , 38.64 \u00b5g/ml LPS). Protective effects of FHCE and HCE on LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells at 1000 \u00b5g/ml, 100 \u00b5g/ml, and 10 \u00b5g/ml were 94.14%, 88.61%, and 76.28%, respectively, and 88.76%, 67.58%, and 55.70%, respectively. These results showed that fermentation of H. cordata increased the viability of LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The expression of flavonoids in LPS-induced inflammatory cells is shown in Table 1 . As expected, FHCE induced higher levels of rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin compared to HCE. The flavonoid levels in LPS-stimulated FHC-treated cells were similar to those in FHCE-treated cells. The effects of different concentrations of FHCE and HCE on HepG2 cell viability are shown in Fig. 5 . The percentages of inhibition induced by 1000 \u00b5g/ml, 100 \u00b5g/ml, and 10 \u00b5g/ml FHCE and HCE on HepG2 cell viability were 38.31%, 47.40%, and 50.54%, respectively, and 47.72%, 62.66%, and 68.66%, respectively. In addition, the detection of rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin at approximately 20 \u00b5M, 100 \u00b5M, and 20 \u00b5M correlated with the effects observed in the MTT assay (Table 1) . Viability and activity of the HepG2 cells treated with FHCE were lower than those of the HepG2 cells treated with HCE at various con-centrations. These results showed that traditionally fermented H. cordata products contain Bacillus strains. Treating cells with extracts derived from fermented H. cordata inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cell death and inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells. FHCE also have an increased content of flavonoids, including rutin, quercetin, and quercitrin. Our results also indicated that the flavonoid constituents of FHCE exhibit excellent anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated cells. These results suggest that the effects of fermentation on H. cordata warrant further investigation. abcdef Means in the same row not sharing a common superscript are significantly different between groups at p < 0.05. * p < 0.05 in two-sided student's t-test on FHCE and HCE.",
