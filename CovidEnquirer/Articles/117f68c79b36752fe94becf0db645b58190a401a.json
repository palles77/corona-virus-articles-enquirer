Methods: Cross-sectional study of CF children with a pulmonary exacerbation. Mid-turbinate swabs were tested by a direct immunofluorescent antibody assay and a multiplex PCR panel (ResPlex II v2.0, Qiagen). Resplex II was also applied to sputum or throat swab samples. Pulmonary function tests and quality of life and severity scores were recorded. Sputum cell counts, bacterial density and cytokines were measured. Results: 26/43 (60.5%) subjects tested positive for at least one respiratory virus by any diagnostic method applied to any sample type. Viruspositive patients were younger (p = 0.047), more likely to be male (p = 0.029), and had higher CF clinical severity (p = 0.041) and lower quality of life (physical) scores (p = 0.023) but similar IL-8, neutrophil percentage and elastase levels.",

Bacterial infections are the main cause of recurrent pulmonary exacerbations leading to progressive lung damage with less known about the role of viral respiratory tract infections [1] [2] [3] . The true impact of respiratory viruses in CF may have been previously underestimated as the majority of previous studies [4, 5] used viral culture and/or immunofluorescence techniques which are relatively insensitive and restricted in breadth for viral detection [1, 2] . To date, published reports of respiratory viral infections in children with CF have primarily focused on the proportion of pulmonary exacerbations associated with viruses [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The relationship between severity of these exacerbations and infection status with respiratory viruses has not been assessed. The extent to which these complications are mediated by direct viral effects or via potentiation of bacterial colonization and infection is unclear [5] . The pulmonary manifestations of CF involve both neutrophildominated airway inflammation and chronic bacterial infection. Although the temporal relationship between infection and inflammation remains unclear in early disease, later in disease there is a self-perpetuating cycle of airway obstruction, chronic bacterial infection and vigorous inflammation resulting in structural damage to the airway [9] [10] [11] . Less is currently known about the contribution from viral infections. A better understanding of the host inflammatory response following respiratory viral infections may minimize the use of prolonged antibiotic therapy.",

Informed consent (and assent from child as appropriate) was obtained from all participants and ethics approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Board at The Hospital for Sick Children.

The CFCS is an acute clinical score, based on signs and symptoms. It was chosen as a severity scale because of its reliability and its ease of use [13] . Body mass index (BMI) percentile was calculated for children \u22652 years of age and weightfor-recumbent length percentile for those under the age of 2 [14] . Mid-turbinate flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrietta, CA), collected from all enrolled patients, were placed into in 3 mL of Universal Transport Medium (UTM-RT COPAN Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA). In addition, children old enough to produce sputum provided sputum samples while FLOQ COPAN throat swabs (inoculated in UTM) were obtained from those unable to produce sputum (refer to Fig. 1 for sample collection and testing).",

To evaluate the potential interference of Sputolysin with the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction and performance of the assay, we randomly chose four known positive mid-turbinate samples (RSV B, PIV 1, HRV/INFA and RSVA) from another study and divided them each into two equal aliquots. The potential interference of Sputolysin was tested on mid-turbinate swabs instead of sputum samples as non Sputolysin-treated sputum samples would not enable appropriate nucleic acid extraction because of the sputum viscosity. We mixed one aliquot with an equal volume of 10% Sputolysin in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) and the other with an equal volume of PBS alone. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, we extracted total nucleic acids from both aliquots with the NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMerieux, St Laurent, QC, Canada ) followed by amplification with the Resplex II v2.0 assay [15] . A patient was classified as being virus-positive if a respiratory virus was detected in the mid-turbinate or throat or sputum sample by any one of the three assays used (DFA, Resplex II v2.0 or RT-PCR).",

Another study [1] conducted during a typical influenza season reported higher influenza A and B detection rates (25%) despite a high influenza vaccination uptake of 70%. These discrepancies may be related to the perfect matching of the pH1N1 vaccine to the circulating influenza viruses during our study period. Compared to another study [1] , our rate of viral coinfection was significantly higher (34.6% vs 4.3%). These discrepancies can be attributed to the broader range of virus detection afforded by the ResPlex II v2.0 assay compared to other molecular-based methods used in this study (detection of 18 viruses vs 9 viruses) [1] . Multiplex assays permit the improved identification of cases of infection with multiple agents although the impact of multiple viral infections on the clinical course of disease is at present unknown and worthy of further study [21] .",

Virus-positive subjects had significantly higher severity and lower quality of life scores. Our ability to detect a difference in severity scores between the two groups but not other metrics of pulmonary exacerbation severity may reflect the increased statistical power afforded by the quantitative nature of the severity and quality of life scores. Another study [22] suggested that children in whom a virus other than rhinovirus or coxsackie/echovirus was identified had a significantly greater decline in FEV1 from baseline compared to children with a rhinovirus infection. However, our repeat analyses after excluding the rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus-positive patients did not change the above findings other than the difference in the CFCS which became insignificant. This might reflect a decreased discriminative ability of CFCS compared to the CFQ-R, the underpowered sample size after excluding rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus-positive patients, and/or a biased estimate resulting from missing CFQ-R data.",

Our study included outpatients with milder exacerbations and consisted of a younger patient-population which may have resulted in a milder degree of airway inflammation and therefore in lower sputum neutrophil counts. We also found levels of inflammatory cytokines in both groups to be similar but reported a two-log lower mean total bacterial density in virus-positive subjects compared to the virus-negative ones (albeit not significant), likely due to the younger age of virus-positive subjects. A recent study [23] reported a trend toward lower cytokine production in CF airway epithelial cells following viral infection. Whether respiratory viruses themselves or by interaction with bacteria induce the observed inflammation remains controversial and requires further investigation.",

The difference in timing of sampling between this study (23% of samples collected during exacerbation) and ours (100% during exacerbation) might have contributed to these observed differences.

Despite the central importance of pulmonary exacerbations as an outcome measure in CF clinical trials, no standardized definition of pulmonary exacerbation that includes children under the age of 6 has been validated. In using a broader definition of pulmonary exacerbation which includes children managed as outpatients, our sample may have included more patients with mild exacerbations than other studies. However, the proportion of hospitalized patients with viral infection in our study (64%) was similar to that of outpatients (58%). Likewise, there are no generally accepted severity scores for pulmonary exacerbations that apply to younger children, including the CFQ-R, a validated and widely used patient-reported outcome. Despite its validation against PFTs as the gold standard, the CFCS has been infrequently used in clinical trials. This highlights the need for further evaluation of its applicability in clinical studies. Our small sample size did not permit subgroup analyses according to individual viruses. Finally, we did not have data on viral infection status in CF children not experiencing an exacerbation as a comparator to strengthen the association between the exacerbation and viral infections. Compared to other viruses such as RSV, rhinoviruses can shed for a prolonged period (N3 weeks vs b1 week) [25] and may have been acquired before the exacerbation. However, virus-positive subjects were more likely to present with fever upon exacerbation.",
