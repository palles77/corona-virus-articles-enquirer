Two DI-specific RNA species, DlssA of genomic size and DlssE of subgenomic size, were detected in DI-infected cells. Purified DI particles, however, were found to contain predominantly DlssA and only a trace amount of DlssE RNA. Despite its negligible amount, the DlssE RNA in virions appears to serve as the template for the synthesis of DlssE RNA in infected cells. This conclusion was supported by two studies. First, the uv target size for DlssE RNA synthesis is significantly smaller than that for DlssA. Second, when purified DlssE RNA was transfected into cells which had been infected with a helper virus, DlssE RNA could replicate itself and became a predominant RNA species in the infected cells. Thus, DlssE RNA was not synthesized from the genomic RNA of DI particles. By studying the relationship between virus dilution and the amount of intracellular viral RNA synthesis, we have further shown that DlssE RNA synthesis requires a helper function, but it does not utilize the leader sequence of the helper virus. In contrast, DlssA synthesis appears to be helper-independent and can replicate itself. Thus DlssA codes for a functional RNA polymerase.",

The negative-stranded RNA then serves as the template for the synthesis of six subgenomic and one genome-sized mRNA (Brayton et al., 1984; Lai et al., 1982b) . These mRNAs are arranged in the form of a 3' coterminal \"nested\" set, i.e., the sequences of each mRNA are contained entirely within the next larger mRNA (Lai et a/., 1981; Leibowitz et a/,, 1981) . In addition, each mRNA has a common leader sequence, which is derived from the 5' end of the genome (Lai et al., 1982a (Lai et al., , 1983 (Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et a/., 1983) .

In Dl-infected cells, the synthesis of most of the standard viral mRNAs is inhibited, but the cells contain three distinct RNA species (Makino et al., 1985) . The first species, DlssA, is equivalent to DI virion RNA, and is eventually incorporated into the virus particles. This RNA differs from the standard virus genomic RNA in that it contains multiple sequence changes distributed throughout the genome, except for regions encoding RNA polymerases and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The second species is mRNA 7, which is indistinguishable from the mRNA 7 made by the standard virus. The synthesis of this mRNA is not inhibited in DI-infected cells. Thus, a normal amount of N protein, which is encoded from this mRNA, is synthesized in DI-infected cells. The third RNA species is a novel subgenomic RNA species, which is single-stranded and polyadenylated. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting studies suggest that it represents sequences derived from various noncontiguous parts of the genome. Interestingly, this RNA differs in size and sequence at different DI passage levels. This RNA was not detected in purified virus particles (Makino et a/., 1984a) .",

Specifically, we asked the following two questions: (1) How are the novel intracellular subgenomic DI RNA species synthesized? Since subgenomic DI RNAs detected in DIinfected cells are not detected in DI particles (Makino et al., 1984a) , it seems plausible that all of the sub-genomic DI RNAs are transcribed de nova from the negative-strand RNA template of DI virion RNA. This mechanism would require multiple jumping during transcription. However, it is also possible that DI particles incorporate a trace amount of subgenomic DI RNA, which can replicate itself in infected cells. The latter mechanism would be more similar to the DI RNA of other virus systems. (2) Does DI genomic RNA code for a functional RNA piolymerase which can replicate DI genomic. RNA without helper viruses? This question arises from the oligonucleotide fingerprinting analysis of DI genomic RNA. This RNA contains multiple deletions as compared to the standard virus genome; however, the 5' end of the genome, which presumably encodes viral RNA polymerases, is essentially intact (Makino et al., 1985) . The studies presented in this report revealed that coronavirus DI RNA synthesis involves several unique features.",

However, we could not rule out the possible presence of a small amount of subgenomic DI RNA species in Dl virus particles. To reexamine this issue, intracellular RNA and RNA isolated from the purified virus released from the same DI-infected cells were compared directly. In the present study, the DI-containing MHV-JHM stock at passage level 17 was used as the source of DI particles. At this passage level, two DI RNA species, DlssA and DlssE, and mRNA 7 were detected in infected cells (Makino et a/., 1985) (Fig. 1, lane b) . The amount of DlssE was different from preparation to preparation of virus stocks (data not shown) (see below). To characterize the RNA species in purified DI particles, a modified procedure was used for virus purification to include virus particles of lower density. A single virus band with a buoyant density of 1.19 g/cm3 was detected (data not shown). This virus preparation contains both standard MHV-JHM genomic RNA and DI genomic RNA (Fig. 1, lane a) . As shown previously, the DI genomic RNA in the purified virus particles represents the packaged DlssA RNA detected in infected cells (Makino et a/., 1985) . No other RNA species are detectable. However, a prolonged exposure of the autoradiogram in this study revealed that the DI virus population contained a trace amount of mRNA 7 and DlssE (Fig. 1, lane c) , suggesting that a minute amount of these subgenomic RNAs could be packaged. The presence of DlssE RNA, though in small quantity, in DI particles necessitated the distinction between DlssA and DlssE itself as the RNA template for the synthesis of DlssE RNA in DI-infected cells.",

This study is based upon the chain-terminating effects of uv photoproducts in the RNA template. Potential sites for these uv lesions are distributed randomly along the RNA, and one uv lesion is sufficient to terminate transcription. Thus, inactivation of RNA synthesis by uv light occurs with pseudo onehit kinetics. In the present study, lesions are induced on the DI genomic RNA by uv irradiation of virus pat-ticles. Therefore, the synthesis of negative-stranded RNA is terminated at the uv lesions on input virion RNA. If DlssE RNA is transcribed from the negative template of DI genomic RNA, the inactivation kinetics of the synthesis of both DlssA and DlssE should be the same. On the contrary, if DlssE RNA is replicated directly from the template of its own size, the DlssE RNA synthesis should be more resistant to uv irradiation than DlssA RNA, since DlssA has a much larger target size.",

However, under nondenaturing conditions, both RNAs were clearly separated (Fig. 2, lanes g-j) probably due to differences in the secondary structure between both RNAs. The latter electropherograms were used for determining the uv sensitivity of DlssA. It is evident that the synthesis of DlssA RNA was inhibited by uv light at a much faster rate than that of DlssE RNA, indicating that the sizes of template RNA of DlssE and DlssA are different. The target sizes of the template RNA for both RNAs were calculated to be equivalent to the physical sizes of these two RNAs, respectively (data not shown).

To determine whether DlssE is synthesized by the same mechanism as standard subgenomic mRNAs, i.e., utilizing a free leader RNA, we determined whether the A59 leader RNA could be utilized for the replication of DlssE RNA. Cells were coinfected with MHV-A59 and the DI particles of MHV-JHM at an m.o.i. of 1 each, and virus-specific intracellular RNAs were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4) . The data showed that the synthesis of MHV-A59 mRNAs was inhibited to the same extent as MHV-JHM by DI particles. However, the synthesis of mRNA 7 was not inhibited. The synthesis of DlssE was stimulated by coinfection with MHV-A59 (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 8) . This stimulation was not observed when MHV-JHM was used as a coinfecting virus (data not shown). The structure of DlssE obtained from cells coinfected with MHV-A59 and that from cells infected with DI only were compared. As shown in Fig. 5 , the oligonucleotide fingerprints of DlssE from these two sources are indistinguishable. Both contain JHM-specific leader T,-oligonucleotide No. 8 and other DlssE-specific T, spots (Makino et a/., 1985) . The leader-specific oligonucleotide of MHV-A59, which would have been electrophoretically distinguishable (Makino eta/., 1986) was not detected in DlssE isolated from coinfected cells. This result was not due to the absence of MHV-A59 leader RNA synthesis since the synthesis of MHV-A59 mRNA 7 was not completely inhibited (Fig. 4, and data dicated that the MHV-A59-specific leader RNA was present in the same molar quantity as other MHV-A59 sequences (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the synthesis of DlssE is the result of replication of its own template, and does not involve a free leader RNA species, which is required for the transcription of standard subgenomic mRNA.",

            "text": "Oligonucleotide fingerprinting analysis shows that the DlssA RNA contains multiple deletions as compared to the wild-type genome; however, the 5'-end gene A, which presumably encodes viral RNA polymerases, is essentially intact (Makino et al., 1985) . This raises a possibility that the DlssA RNA may encode a functional polymerase. Thus, DlssA RNA could be synthesized independently of the helper functions provided by standard viruses. To prove the DlssA encodes a functional polymerase which can synthesize its own RNA independently of helper functions, we examined the effects of serial virus dilution on the synthesis of DI-specific RNAs. Since the virus stock used in this experiment contained both DI particles and wild-type MHV-JHM, serial virus dilution would reduce the possibility of a cell being coinfected with both DI particles and standard helper viruses. Thus, if DI RNA synthesis requires helper functions from the standard virus, the DI RNA synthesis should decrease exponentially following virus dilution, according to a two-hit kinetics. In contrast, a one-hit kinetics would indicate that DI RNA can be synthesized independently of helper functions. Cells were infected with serial dilutions of either DI-containing MHV-JHM stock or standard MHV-JHM, and 3zP-labeled virus-specific RNA were separated by electrophoresis (Figs. 6A, 6B, 6C) . The amounts of virus-specific RNAs were quantified by densitometry and the graphs were fitted by linear regression analysis (Figs. 6D, 6E, 6F ). The effects of virus dilution on the synthesis of standard virus-spe- cific mRNAs are shown in Figs. 6B and 6E. Since all MHV-specific mRNAs are transcribed from the same negative template of genomic RNA (Lai et a/., 1982b) , the kinetics of RNA synthesis for all mRNAs vs virus dilution follows a one-hit kinetics. Similarly, the synthesis of DlssA decreased linearly following virus dilution, according to a one-hit kinetics (Figs. 6A and 6D) , suggesting that DlssA was synthesized in the absence of helper functions. Thus the DI genomic RNA contains all the genetic information required for DlssA RNA synthesis. In contrast, the reduction of DlssE RNA synthesis followed a two-hit kinetics, suggesting that helper functions from standard viruses are required for DlssE synthesis (Figs. 6A and 6D) . This interpretation was further tested by a similar virus dilution experiment performed in the presence of a constant amount of excess standard MHV-JHM (m.o.i. = 5). As shown in Figs. 6C and 6F, the kinetics of DlssE RNA synthesis appeared similar to that of DlssA as compared by simple regression analysis. This study demonstrated that the replication of subgenomic DI RNA requires a trans-acting product(s), which was supplied by the coinfecting standard virus.",

Since MHV DI particles were previously shown to contain only the genome-sized RNA (Makino et al., 1984a) , it was suggested that DlssE RNA had to be transcribed de novo from the DI genomic RNA by a jumping transcription mechanism. The data in this report showed that a minute amount of DlssE RNA could be packaged along with other subgenomic mRNAs into virus particles. The studies of uv target size and transfection of DlssE RNA conclusively indicated that the DlssE RNA synthesis utilizes the negative-strand RNA template of its own size and does not rely on the DI genome. Thus, DlssE RNA is most likely replicated from the packaged DlssE RNA associated with the virus particles. This study thus indicated that DlssE RNA synthesis is different from the transcription of subgenomic mRNAs of standard MHV. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that DlssE RNA synthesis does not utilize a free leader RNA of a helper virus. Thus, DlssE RNA synthesis is more similar to the replication of MHV RNA genome.",

This may account for the variation in the amount of DlssE RNA synthesized by different DI-containing virus preparations, since different DI stocks may contain different amounts of DlssE RNA in the virion. Thus, it is likely that DlssE RNA lacks packaging signals, or, alternatively, DlssE RNA may be too small to be packaged efficiently. Presently we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.",

Despite the small number of cells infected with viruses carrying DlssE RNA, the DlssE RNA is the predominant RNA species in infected cultures. These data suggest that the replication of DlssE RNA has an enormous advantage over the synthesis of other MHV RNA species. The sequence analysis of DlssE RNA (unpublished data) shows that this RNA is composed of three discontiguous parts of the viral genome including the 5'-end leader and 3'-end of genomic RNA, and also contains some minor sequence changes within the leader sequence. It is not clear which part is responsible for this enhanced RNA synthesis. As suggested by the studies of the effects of virus dilution on DI RNA synthesis (Fig. 6) , the synthesis of DlssE apparently requires transacting products provided by helper viruses. It is unlikely that free leader RNA species are the helper function, since A59 leader RNA did not reassort with DlssE RNA (Fig. 5) . One candidate helper function may be viral RNA polymerase.",

It has been suggested that N protein is important for MHV RNA synthesis (Compton et al., 1987) .
