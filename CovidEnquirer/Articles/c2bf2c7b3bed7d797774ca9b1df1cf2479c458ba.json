Little effort, however, has been made to study the risk of isolation patients acquiring secondary infections from contaminated air migrating into negatively pressurized isolation rooms from adjacent spaces. As a result, an actual hospital was used to observe the transport of aerosol from a nursing station and general patient room to a nearby airborne infectious isolation room (AIIR). Aerosols 3.0\u00b5m (viruses and most airborne bacteria) were found to be capable of migrating 14.5m from a general patient room to an AIIR anteroom entrance in <14 minutes at concentrations 2-5 times greater than ambient (e.g. background). Concentrations of aerosols within the anteroom and isolation room, however, remained virtually unchanged from ambient levels, indicating the effectiveness of door position and (or) ventilation. In contrast, gravitational settling and surface deposition appeared to limit the migration of aerosols >3.0\u00b5m to the entrance of the general patient room (4.5m).",

Airborne isolation is required for patients diagnosed with varicella, rubella and tuberculosis as well as an increasing number of new and emerging diseases suspected of being transmitted via the airborne route such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] . Several organizations including the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) provide ventilation requirements for airborne isolation [2] . According to ASHRAE Standard 170-2008, an AIIR must sustain inward airflow and a -2.5Pa pressure relationship with the corridor and all other adjacent spaces. An AIIR must maintain a minimum of two outside air changes and 12 total air changes per hour (ACH). AIIR anterooms must meet the same requirements as the isolation room, except the minimum number of total air changes is reduced to 10. Moreover, the anteroom should be positively pressurized with respect to the isolation room and negatively pressurized with respect to the corridor.",

The ward consisted of twenty-eight general patient rooms, two airborne infectious isolation rooms (AIIRs) and ancillary function spaces. The ward was supplied with 136.7m 3 /min of 100% outside air (as verified by duct traverse measurements) from a single air handling unit (AHU) providing conditioned air directly to the corridor, ancillary spaces and isolation rooms and indirectly to general patient rooms via re-circulating fan coil units.

The production rate and particle size distribution was consistent with findings of other recent studies pertaining to human lung capacity and respiratory aerosol generation [4] [5] [6] [7] . Background concentrations of ambient airborne particles were sampled for 15 minutes prior to PAO aerosol injection. The PAO aerosol was then continuously injected at the approximate location of a patient's nose-mouth at rest (0.8m) in the general patient room ( Figure 2 ) using a NUCON SN-10 pneumatic aerosol generator for a total of 30 minutes (Table 1) . Particle size distribution measurements (particles/L) ranging from 0.5-10.0\u00b5m were collected using a NUCON F-1000-DD forward light scattering photometric aerosol detector at a total of five (5) sampling locations (Figure 2 ). Air samples from each sampling point were drawn at 30 second intervals for a total of 30 minutes each. Sampling instrumentation was calibrated prior to testing using 2.5mg of PAO per m3 of air as part of a calibration procedure developed with guidance from ANSI 510 and 511, ASME AG-1 and ASHRAE 52.2. During testing, the entry door to the general patient room was fully open and the entry doors to the isolation anteroom and isolation patient room were fully closed as per standard operating procedures.

In the nurse station vicinity, the model encompassed the distance between the isolation room and the patient on one direction, and it ended by the nearest walls in the perpendicular direction ( Figure 2) . A commercial software (Ansys Fluent 15.0) was used to simulate the air motion (primary phase) and the particles (discrete phase). The Realizable K-\u03b5 method was employed to model the turbulence as an inherent part of all indoor air motions. The entire domain was discretized by tetrahedral meshes with a total of approximately 2.5 million nodes. The discrete phase (particles) was assumed to move based on the resultant of forces exerted on each particle (i.e. Eulerian-Lagrangian method). For this study, the drag force, Brownian force, Saffman's lift force, and pressure gradient force were placed on each particle in addition to gravity [8] . A total of 500 particle were injected from the patient room and tracked to their ultimate fate. Particles assumed to 'escape' from the outlets (e.g. exhaust fans, pressure outlets) and 'trap' when colliding solid surfaces. Only 1.0\u00b5m particle size was modeled.",

Only 7 particles (1.4%) migrated to the nursing station and none could reach to the isolation room door way. The CFD results agreed with the experimental findings suggesting that the model was successfully simulated the particle transport mechanism. Thus, the CFD results were further analyzed to explore more details of particle behavior. Inside the patient room, almost 60% of particles were removed by the ventilation system. The deposition rate was 35% distributed over wall-, ceiling-, and floor-deposition. Statistical analysis revealed that particles traveled 44m on average (\u03c3=18.57m). The average time particles suspended in the space was 13.7 minutes (\u03c3 =11min) and the distribution was skewed to the left (g=2.729). Moreover, the average height of particles was 1.8m (\u03c3 =0.43). The height distribution seemed to be appreciably skewed to the right (g=-1.554). More than 35% of particles were observed to be in the breathing zone (0.7m<h<1.80m) [9] which showed the propensity of particles to rise and be effectively removed by the ceiling level ventilation system.",

This migration can be exacerbated when an isolation room is located right across the hallway ( 2.5m) given the negative pressurization of isolation rooms. Thus, the idea of designing the isolation room with sufficient distance from the adjacent patient rooms and placing supply diffusers near its doorway could reduce the risk of secondary airborne infection. It should also be noted that the source could have been closer in the nursing station instead of the patient room, and thus, increasing the contaminate concentration at the AIIR entrance and the risk of secondary infection to isolation patients.",
