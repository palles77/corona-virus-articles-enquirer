            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in Guangdong Province, China in 2002 and eventually spread to 30 countries. More than 8400 cases and approximately 920 deaths were confirmed as SARS-related \u2020. SARS is caused by a coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which has a positivestrand RNA genome of approximately 30 kb in length with a 5 0 cap and 3 0 poly(A) tail. 1, 2 Coronaviruses have been subdivided into three phylogenetic groups. Groups 1 and 2 infect mammals, usually resulting in only a mild respiratory distress. Group 3 infects birds and includes the causative agent of a severe disease that is economically significant for the poultry industry. 3, 4 Analysis of the complete genomes of over a dozen SARS-CoV isolates from around the world indicate that SARS-CoV is not a mutant or a recombinant of known coronaviruses, but a novel one that acquired the ability to infect humans. 5 Isolation of a nearly identical coronavirus from civet cats, raccoon dogs, and badgers, suggests SARS-CoV jumped species from its natural animal host to humans. 6 Coronaviruses produce two large polyproteins that are proteolytically processed to yield replicationassociated proteins named Nsp1-16, and several structural proteins that are translated from subgenomic RNAs. The sub-genomic RNAs have a common 5 0 leader sequence that is derived from the 5 0 end of genomic RNA. One current model predicts that fusion of the leader to the sub-genomic RNA occurs during minus-strand RNA synthesis, when the replicase ternary complex translocates at specific positions in the template RNA and then resumes RNA synthesis near the 5 0 end. [7] [8] [9] Alternatively, a leader-prime mechanism for plus-strand synthesis has been proposed. 3, 10 This model states that a free 5 0 leader anneals to a complementary sequence at one of the intergenic sites and primes transcription of a sub-genomic RNA.",

Indeed, three such proteins have been identified by sequence homology: Nsp14, a putative exonuclease; Nsp15, an endoribonuclease; and Nsp16, a putative RNA methyltransferase. 11, 12 Recently, we confirmed the predicted function for SARS-CoV Nsp15, and showed that its activity was enhanced by Mn 2C and that cleavage was specific for uridylate residues. 13 Similar results were reported by Ivanov et al., 14 who also demonstrated that the Nsp15 ortholog of human coronavirus was essential for virus replication. RNA endoribonuclease activity is unusual among plus-strand RNA viruses, suggesting that it could be a target for antiviral development. In addition, the high specificity for unpaired uridylate residues suggests that Nsp15 could be used to study RNA structure and function.",

It may also be significant that yields of three of these inactive proteins (H234A, H249A, and K289A) were approximately 1000-fold higher than wild-type protein (data not shown), suggesting that they were less toxic to bacteria. D272A was synthesized at levels equivalent to the histidine and lysine mutants, but was mostly insoluble. Thus, the final yield of D272A was low, but the high level of synthesis suggested that it was also not toxic to cells due to its complete lack of activity. Bacteria harboring these four expression plasmids also grew faster than those with wild-type plasmid or the other substitutions, suggesting that even a low-level expression of active protein was detrimental to the cells.

The molecular mass was determined by direct fitting with the Lamm equation, and the derived values were within 8% of that expected for monomers (40.8 kDa) and 1% of the predicted hexamer molecular mass (285 kDa). We previously showed that wild-type Nsp15 underwent a large conformational change when titrated with Mn 2C , but not Mg 2C , by change in intrinsic fluorescence of Nsp15. 13 Therefore, we tested the addition of 10 mM Mn 2C to see if oligomerization was responsible for this shift. We found that Mn 2C changed the proportion of hexamers from 63% to 66%, indicating that alterations in oligomerization was probably not responsible for the decreased intrinsic fluorescence observed previously. Gelfiltration chromatography performed in the presence of 5 mM Mn 2C also caused only a slight shift from monomer to hexamer, confirming that Mn 2C has only a minor effect on the oligomerization state (data not shown). When Nsp15 was examined for the ratio of monomers and hexamers at higher protein concentration (1 mM), however, the relative amount of hexamer increased to 85% (Figure 4(b) ).

The inset shows the standard curve for the protein markers (triangles) and the predicted molecular masses for the different forms of Nsp15 (squares). particles were selected and grouped into subclasses as representing various views for 3D reconstruction. During the fifth iterative refinement, the data began to converge and after the eighth refinement cycle, no further improvement was achieved (Figure 7(c) ). Although there was a scarcity of face-on projections, as shown by the asymmetric triangle ( Figure 6(d) ), there was a large number of different side-on views thus permitting a 3D reconstruction (Figure 6(e) ). The validation of the reconstruction is, however, critically dependent on choosing the correct point group symmetry. Analysis of the symmetry of the 2D crystals (Figure 7) aided this process greatly. The symmetry of the lattices formed was determined to be consistent with a p3 plane group. While the projection map (Figure 7 (c)) displays six density maxima per unit cell, the overall distribution of the protein mass followed a triangular arrangement. In addition, there was good agreement between the projection map and the 3D reconstruction when viewed faceon ( Figure 6(e) ). The large number of side-on views also supported the idea that Nsp15 has a twolayered structure. Together with the overall dimensions of Nsp15 (9 nm wide and 11 nm tall), this could explain why the molecules preferentially lie on their sides on the carbon support film. Since the face-on projections display 3-fold rotational Figure 5 .

The predicted migration of hexamers, trimers, and monomers relative to molecular mass markers is shown at the right. symmetry, and that the two-layered side-on projections display 2-fold symmetry, we conclude the point group symmetry is D3, making Nsp15 a hexamer consisting of two trimeric rings on top of each other. These findings are in excellent agreement with the biochemical data showing that one form of Nsp15 is a hexamer.",

We were unable to perform a similar analysis with E210A because the activity of this enzyme was not sufficient to obtain initial rate measurements at low enzyme concentrations. Addition of H234A at concentrations up to 300 nM to substrate revealed no significant change in fluorescence (data not shown).",

Three of these (gel-filtration, native gel electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation) allowed the possibility to detect monomers and trimers simultaneously, when present. The patterns obtained with gel-filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation for the wild-type protein correlated well, with both indicating a ratio of approximately 85-90% hexamers at 1-5 mM Nsp15. The absence of intermediate states observed in both of these assays suggests that transition between the two forms is rapid. Gradient pore electrophoresis, however, was able to capture trimers. This is possibly due to the fact that the samples were electrophoresed until protein molecules reached a point where the polyacrylamide pore size limit their further movement. Therefore, if hexamers dissociate into trimers, their rate of migration would increase and they move into a region of the gel where the pores were too small for hexamers to reform.",

This is consistent with the pore gradient electrophoresis results, as this technique yielded consistently less hexamer than the other two methods. Only hexamers and monomers were observed by ultracentrifugation, and this probably reflects the fact that normally short-lived trimers are more stable in gel-filtration than ultracentrifugation. In addition, the protein concentration in the gel-filtration experiments was fivefold higher than for ultracentrifugation. The sum of the E3 data showed that hexamer formation was impaired consistently as compared to wild-type and the other mutants under the same conditions. Electron microscopic analysis of Nsp15 provided direct visualization of hexamers, and supported the idea of a trimeric intermediate, as the structure indicated a dimer of trimers. To our knowledge, this is the first visualization of the structure of Nsp15. There are several interesting features to note about the structure of Nsp15. (i) The protein densities that participate in the ring-like structure appear to be divided into two distinct domains, making it easy to be mistaken for a hexameric instead of a trimeric ring. One of these domains is involved in providing inter-trimeric contacts. (ii) A third domain that contributes to the pronounced central density (arrow in Figure 7 (e)), may serve as a contact point for all six subunits, therefore enhancing the interactions within each trimeric ring as well as between the two trimers. (iii) Finally, the overall structure is highly cavernous, which offers many possible sites for RNA binding and processing.",

First, the rate of RNA cleavage by Nsp15 increased exponentially with protein concentration. Second, mutation of the highly conserved N-terminal residue E3 apparently altered the subunit association constant so that the equilibrium was shifted toward monomers, which also caused a significant decrease in endoribonuclease activity. Importantly, the fact that E3 enzymatic activity was restored at higher protein concentrations argues for the higher-order structure being the enzymatically relevant one. Lastly, the mutant proteins that retained enzymatic activity also retained the ability to form hexamers in the native gel electrophoresis assay. These results argue that the hexamer is the enzymatically active state for the SARS-CoV Nsp15 protein. The only observation inconsistent with the oligomer being the enzymatically active state is that the concentration required for enzymatic activity is lower (w0.1 mM) than the concentration needed to observe hexamer formation (w1 mM).

In fact, mutations of the residues corresponding to H234A, H249A, and K289A in XendoU decreased its endoribonuclease activity severely without an obvious effect on RNA binding. 15 Together, these results raise the possibility that catalytic activity involves recycling of hexamers from monomers or trimers, and that mutants that are unable to associate have low activity and inactive mutants do not recycle properly.

Similar to our observations of the Nsp15 E3A, mutagenesis of residues essential for hexamer formation decreased the enzymatic activity of RNase PH. E. coli polynucleotide phosphorylase and the yeast exosome are trimeric nucleases, where each monomer contains two repeats of an RNase PH-like domain. 18, 19 Hexameric rings of these molecules preclude entry of double-stranded RNA into the active site, indicating that specificity is at least partially structuredependent.

            "text": "Currently, the role of Nsp15 in the coronavirus infection process is unknown. Several possibilities can be imagined. First, Nsp15 could be involved in SARS-CoV sub-genomic RNA synthesis. If SARS-CoV synthesizes sub-genomic RNAs by discontinuous extension of negative strands as proposed by Sawicki & Sawicki, 9 an endoribonuclease could help untether the ternary replication complex and facilitate its translocation to the leader sequence. There is precedence for such activities in viruses. An analogous nuclease activity plays a role in retrovirus replication. The RNase H activity that degrades the RNA portion of an RNA/DNA duplex releases the polymerase complex at a strong-stop sequence, after the initial round of synthesis from the tRNA primer. 20 Alternatively, if SARS uses the leader-prime mechanism for synthesis of subgenomic RNAs, 21 the nascent leader RNA could be processed by Nsp15 for use in sub-genomic synthesis. Second, Nsp15 could be involved in degradation of the minus-strand RNA. Coronavirus minus-strand RNA is highly unstable and Wang & Sawicki 22 have speculated that turnover of minusstrands regulates plus-strand RNA synthesis and decreases recognition by cellular surveillance systems that target the dsRNA intermediate. In support of this idea, it has been shown that minusstrand RNA initiates with a polyuridylate stretch, 23 a sequence that should readily be cleaved by Nsp15. Instead of, or in addition to, possible roles for Nsp15 in viral nucleic acid synthesis, Nsp15 could digest cellular RNAs, either to disrupt cellular functions or to prevent synthesis of antiviral and proapoptotic proteins. There is precedence for this in a positivestrand RNA virus. The pestiviral structural glycoprotein E rns is also an endoribonuclease that can negatively affect dsRNAs that are inducers of the interferon beta response. 24 A final possibility is that Nsp15 has evolved in order to disrupt the function of the cellular homolog, EndoU, which is required for the processing of snoRNAs from their precursor RNAs. 25 The Nsp15 mutations analyzed in this study will be valuable as a guide to understanding the roles of Nsp15 in vivo studies. In addition, Nsp15 structural studies should benefit from the availability of mutant proteins that are defective for hexamer formation, such as E3A, and the mutants that can form hexamers, but are inactive for endoribonuclease activity.",

Samples were electrophoresed in Tris-borate buffer (pH 8.3) for 6 h at 200 V at 4 8C, a time at which it was empirically observed that the protein ceased to migrate through the gel suggesting the different species had reached their pore exclusion. Native molecular mass markers were the same as those used for gel-filtration.",

An initial 3D model was calculated from two orthogonal projections (face-on and side-on views) in C3 (one axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry) and subsequently refined in D3 (one axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry intersected by an additional orthogonal axis of 2-fold rotational symmetry). The reconstructions were iteratively refined until the structure was stable as judged by Fourier shell correlation (FSC). A molecular mass of 240 kDa was used for the surface rendering threshold of the 3D structure. 3D reconstructions were visualized using the USCF Chimera software package 30 and crystallographic images were analyzed and processed (Fourier transforms, lattice refinement, calculation of projection maps) using CRISP. 31 were visualized using the UCSF Chimera package from the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco (supported by NIH P41 RR-01081).",
