            "text": "Viruses are the main cause of respiratory tract infections. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) enables unbiased detection of all potential pathogens. To apply mNGS in viral diagnostics, sensitive and simultaneous detection of RNA and DNA viruses is needed. Herein, were studied the performance of an in-house mNGS protocol for routine diagnostics of viral respiratory infections with potential for automated pan-pathogen detection. The sequencing protocol and bioinformatics analysis were designed and optimized, including exogenous internal controls. Subsequently, the protocol was retrospectively validated using 25 clinical respiratory samples. The developed protocol using Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing showed high repeatability. Use of the National Center for Biotechnology Information's RefSeq database as opposed to the National Center for Biotechnology Information's nucleotide database led to enhanced specificity of classification of viral pathogens. A correlation was established between read counts and PCR cycle threshold value. Sensitivity of mNGS, compared with PCR, varied up to 83%, with specificity of 94%, dependent on the cutoff for defining positive mNGS results. Viral pathogens only detected by mNGS, not present in the routine diagnostic workflow, were influenza C, KI polyomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus. Sensitivity and analytical specificity of this mNGS protocol were comparable to PCR and higher when considering off-PCR target viral pathogens. One single test detected all potential viral pathogens and simultaneously obtained detailed information on detected viruses. Respiratory tract infections pose a great burden on public health, causing extensive morbidity and mortality among patients worldwide. 1e3 Most acute respiratory tract infections are caused by viruses, such as rhinovirus, influenza A and B viruses, metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. 4 However, in 20% to 62% of the patients, no pathogen is detected. 4e6 This might be the result of diagnostic failures or even infection by unknown pathogens, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2012. 7 Rapid identification of the respiratory pathogen is critical to determine downstream decision making, such as isolation measures or treatment, including cessation of antibiotic therapy. Current diagnostic amplification methods, such as real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), are sensitive and specific, but are only targeting predefined virus species or types. Genetic diversity within the virus genome and the sheer number of potential pathogens in many clinical conditions pose limitations to predefined primer-and probebased approaches, leading to false-negative results. 8 These limitations, combined with the potential emergence of new or unusual pathogens, highlight the need for less restricted approaches that could improve the diagnosis and subsequent outbreak management of infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Metagenomics relates to the study of the complete genomic content in a complex mixture of (micro) organisms. 9 Unlike bacteria, viruses do not display a common gene in all virus families, and therefore pan-virus detection relies on catch-all analytic methods. Metagenomic or untargeted next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers a culture-and nucleotide sequenceeindependent method that eliminates the need to define the targets for diagnosis beforehand. Besides primary detection, mNGS immediately offers additional information, on virulence markers, epidemiology, genotyping, and evolution of pathogens. 7,10e12 Furthermore, quantitative assessment of the presence of virus copies in the sample is enabled by the number of reads. 8 Although original mNGS studies typically aim at analysis of (shifts in) population diversity of abundant DNA microbes, detection of viral pathogens in patient samples requires a different technical approach because of the usually low abundance of viral pathogens (<1%) in clinical samples and the requisite of detecting both DNA and RNA viruses. Hence, a low limit of detection for RNA and DNA in one single assay is essential for implementation of mNGS for routine pathogen detection in clinical diagnostic laboratories. Current viral mNGS protocols are optimized for either RNA or DNA detection. 11,13e15 Consequently, detection of both RNA and DNA viruses requires parallel workup of both RNA and DNA pretreatment methods. In addition, to increase the relative concentration of viral sequences, viral particle enrichment techniques are often applied. 8, 12 These techniques are laborious and not easily automated for routine clinical diagnostic use. Moreover, during enrichment directed at viral particles, intracellular viral nucleic acids as genomes and mRNAs are being discarded. After sequencing, the bioinformatic classification and interpretation of the results remain a major challenge. Bioinformatic classifiers are often developed for use in either microbiome studies or classification of high abundant reads, whereas extensive validation for clinical diagnostic use in settings of low abundance is limited. After bioinformatics classification, the challenge remains to discriminate between viruses that play a role in disease etiology and nonpathogenic viruses. 16 Before considering mNGS in routine diagnostics, there is a need for critical evaluation and validation of every step in the procedure.",

Therefore, this study has initiated the optimization of several steps throughout the presequencing and postsequencing workflow, which are considered essential for sensitive and specific mNGS-based virus detection. Many virus discovery or virus diagnostic protocols have focused on the enrichment of viral particles 32 with the intention to increase the relative amount of virus reads. However, these methods are laborious and intrinsically exclude viral nucleic acid located in host cells. Herein, a sample pretreatment protocol was designed with potential for: i) automation, ii) pan-pathogen detection, and iii) detection of intracellular viral nucleic acids. Consequently, any type of viral enrichment was excluded (filtration, centrifugation, nucleases, and rRNA removal). The current protocol enabled highthroughput sample pretreatment by means of automated nucleic acid extraction and without depletion of bacterial or human genome, with potential for pan-pathogen detection. Several adaptations in the bioinformatic script resulted in more accurate reporting of the classification output.",

The amount of internal control reads and target virus reads has been reported to be dependent on the amount of background reads (negative correlation). 34 In our protocol, the internal controls were used as qualitative controls but may be used as indicator of the amount of background. PhHV1 showed less linearity in the dilution series, compared with EAV, which may be indicative for a potential relative difference in efficiency of amplification of PhHV1 viral sequences. Because NCBI's databases were lacking a complete PhHV1 genome, the Centrifuge index building and classification was limited to classification on a higher taxonomic rank. To achieve classification of PhHV1 at the species level, the whole genome of PhHV1 was sequenced; and based on the gained sequence reads, the genome was built. 25 The proposed nearly complete genome of PhHV1 was submitted to NCBI's GenBank database.",

Five viruses, which were not recovered by mNGS, had high Cq values, >30 (ie, a relatively low viral load). This may be a drawback of the retrospective nature of this clinical evaluation as RNA viruses may be degraded because of storage and freeze-thaw steps, resulting in lower sensitivity of mNGS. A correlation was found between read counts and PCR Cq value, demonstrating the quantitative nature of viral detection by mNGS. Discrepancies between the Cq values and the number of mNGS reads may be explained by unrepresentative Cq values (eg, by primer mismatch for highly divergent viruses, like rhinoviruses/enteroviruses and differences in sensitivity of mNGS for several groups of viruses, as has been reported by others). 35 In addition, viral pathogens were detected that were not targeted by the routine PCR assays, including influenza C virus, which is typical of the unbiased nature of the method. In addition, although not within the scope of this study, bacterial pathogens, including Bordetella pertussis (qPCR confirmed), were also detected. In the current study, only viruses were targeted because these could be well compared with qPCR results; bacterial targets remain to be studied in clinical sample types as sputum or bronchoalveolar lavages that are more suitable for bacterial detection. The analytical specificity of mNGS appeared to be high, especially with a cutoff of 15 reads. However, the clinical specificity, the relevance of the lower read numbers, still needs further investigation in clinical studies.",

This problem could be attributed to index hopping (index misassignment), as described earlier. 36 Because of the chemistry, essential for the increased speed, the HiSeq 4000 is more prone to index hopping between neighboring samples. Although the percentage of reads that contributed to the index hopping was low, this is critical for clinical viral diagnostics, as this is aimed specifically at low abundance targets. 36, 37 Bioinformatics classification of metagenomic sequence data with the pipeline Centrifuge required identification of the optimal parameters to minimize misclassified and unclassified reads.
