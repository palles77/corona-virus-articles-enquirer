            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are considered one of the most common respiratory viruses associated with respiratory tract illnesses. An emergent human coronavirus was identified as the causal agent of an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2002-2003. The severity of the disease combined with its rapid spread requires the continuous surveillance of coronaviruses in worldwide populations. Epidemiological and clinical data of HCoVs infectious in the Brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two groups of patients. Our study aimed to investigate retrospectively the presence of HCoVs in different populations of S\u00e3o Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) during the years of 2001-2010. A pancoronavirus RT-PCR was performed in this study. Coronaviruses were detected in 126 (11.5%) of 1,087 specimens. Peaks detection frequency was observed during 2002-2004 and 2008-2009, with the highest detection in 2008. The prevalence of HCoVs was higher among children with heart diseases (24.6%), patients under stem cell transplantation program (24.3%) and renal transplanted patients (20.2%). Coryza, cough and fever were the most common symptoms at presentation of positive cases and wheezing, a lower respiratory tract infection symptom was reported by 12% of the total, and 27% of high at-risk patients. HCoVs may have an important role among patients with underlying conditions and transplanted ones.",

            "text": "Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are positivestranded, enveloped RNA viruses classified within the family Coronaviridae (genus, Coronavirus) (Hendley et al., 1972) . They are associated mainly with respiratory tract illness but are also involved in enteric and central nervous system diseases (Resta et al., 1985; Murray et al., 1992; Stewart et al., 1992) . Until recently only three human coronaviruses were thoroughly studied. Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) were identified in the 1960s (Hamre and Procknow, 1966) and are well recognized as important pathogens that cause the common cold. A third novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV, was identified as the causal agent during the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respi-ratory syndrome (SARS) (Drosten et al., 2003) . The increase in research on these viruses soon led to discovery of 2 other human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 in the Netherlands and HCoV-HKU1 in China (van der Hoek et al., 2004; Woo et al., 2005) both detected in respiratory tract specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract illnesses. Since July 2003 when the last case of SARS associated with the epidemic was reported only four human coronaviruses are known to continuously circulate in the human population. Results from epidemiological studies have led to the conclusion that these viruses are worldwide distributed and circulate with biennial prevalence (McIntosh et al., 1970; Vabret et al., 2003; van Elden et al., 2004; Chiu et al., 2005; Gerna et al., 2007) . However, there are few studies that have described the epidemiological and clinical features of human coronaviruses infection among different popula-tions, such as at-risk children or adults, patients with underlying conditions, those hospitalized, the immunocompromised patients and others, mainly in South America. In the present study, we retrospectively looked for the presence of HCoVs in different populations of Sao Paulo presenting acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) from 2001 to 2010, to assess the prevalence that HCoVs infections have on different groups of Brazilian patients and to describe the clinical presentation of the ARIs caused by this virus and their circulation trends in Brazil.",

A pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay previously described (Vijgen et al., 2008) with just minor modifications (50 cycles of amplification to 40 and melting temperature from 48\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C), was performed in order to detect human and animal coronaviruses in the samples. The amplification of a 251 bp fragment of the polymerase gene was performed using the following primer set: Cor-FW (5'-ACWCARHTVAAYYTNAARTAYGC-3') and Cor-RV (5'-TCRCAYTTDGGRTARTCCCA-3'). These one-step RT-PCR assays (OneStep RT-PCR kit; QIAGEN) were undertaken in a 50 mL reaction volume containing 10 mL RNA-extract, 10 mL 5x QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, 2 mL dNTP mix (final concentration of 400 mM of each dNTP), 1.8 mL QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix (a combination of Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase and Hot-StarTaq DNA polymerase), 4 mM of each primer, and RNase-free water to 50 mL. Positive and negative controls were included in each PCR experiment. The reaction was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, 40 cycles of amplification (30 sec at 94\u00b0C; 30 sec at 50\u00b0C; 1 min at 72\u00b0C), and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min in a VERITI thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

Human coronavirus is considered one of the most common respiratory viruses associated with respiratory tract infections, mainly among children. Epidemiological and clinical data of HCoVs infectious in the Brazilian population are scarce and restricted to one or two group of patients. Bellei et al. (2008) reported 4.2% of human coronaviruses in Brazilian adults, Cabe\u00e7a and Bellei (2012) described a fatal case of HCoV-NL63 associated with pneumonia in a Brazilian adult and Albuquerque et al. (2009) reported 1.9% among Brazilian children. This is the first Brazilian report of HCoVs from distinct Brazilian population over a period of nine years.",

A pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay is a usefull molecular tool to test for all coronaviruses in a clinical sample. In addition, quick screening for several pathogens in one assay allows the identification of previously unknown coronaviruses. However, the pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay used could have led to some limitations in our study. First, HCoVs subtypes were not identified and the prevalence of our study could be overestimated and/or underestimated once the assay included non specific primers that target all human and animal coronaviruses. Therefore, the use of degenerate primers set in a conventional RT-PCR may enhance detection of coronavirus genome variations, but may also miss samples with less genome copies. To have a better understanding about it and mainly to rule out the possibility of a bias, we sequenced a portion of the coronaviruses positive cases detected in the present study using pancoronavirus primers set. The positive cases detected among hospitalized patients from 2009 to 2010 were sequenced and all samples were confirmed as human coronaviruses .",

We demonstrate the presence of HCoVs infection in all studied populations, with a significant prevalence among some at-risk group patients, such as patients under stem cell transplantation program and children with heart diseases. This higher frequency of HCoVs may be related to the functional condition of these patients. On the other hand, a lower prevalence was observed among children from community when compared with our different studied populations. Since the majority of these children presented influenza-like illness instead of common cold symptoms, the clinical pattern can explain this lower frequency among this group of patients. Underlying conditions other than cardiac/transplantation were observed among 20% of coronaviruses-infected patients. This data along with the higher prevalence of coronaviruses-infected cases found in specific at-risk group patients pointed to the relevance of coronaviruses causing respiratory tract illness in patients with comorbidities.",
