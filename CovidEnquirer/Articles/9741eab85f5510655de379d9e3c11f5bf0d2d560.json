Serum PCT was measured by the VIDAS BRAHMS enzyme-linked fluorescence assay (measurement range 0AE05-200 ng \u2044 ml; bio-Merieux, Lyon, France), and CRP was measured with an automated multichannel analyzer (model TBA-30FR; Toshiba, Saitama, Japan).

In our study, the cutoff values that best differentiated mixed bacterial infection pneumonia from viral pneumonia were 1AE5 ng \u2044 ml for PCT and 10 mg \u2044 dl for CRP. The cutoff value for PCT in discriminating bacterial infections from viral infections varies among previous studies: 0AE4 ng \u2044 ml in a study by Chirouze et al. 19 1AE0 ng \u2044 ml in a study of severe acute respiratory syndrome by Chua et al. 20 and 0AE8 ng \u2044 ml in a study by Ingram et al. 13 The variety in presented cutoff values may be attributed to the presence of a large overlap in PCT concentrations between viral and bacterial infections. 21 The utility of PCT and CRP as biomarkers has been discussed in various studies. [22] [23] [24] And the role of PCT and CRP in discriminating bacterial \u2044 mixed infection from 2009 H1N1 pneumonia has been reported in a recent study of 38 patients by Guervilly et al. 12 and their results showed that only PCT values were statistically higher in patients with mixed bacterial infections. They measured PCT values in the 24 hours after admission. With the cutoff of 0AE5 ng \u2044 ml for PCT, the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive values were 100%, 52AE5%, 100%, and 42%, respectively. Our study, in comparison, examined the PCT and CRP values on initial ED visit. Our data showed that both PCT and CRP were useful in discriminating viral infection from mixed bacterial infection, with the cutoff was 1AE5 ng \u2044 ml for PCT, and 10 mg \u2044 dl for CRP. This distinction in the cutoffs and performance of markers may be attributed to the difference in the timing of measurement of inflammatory markers, and total patient numbers between the two studies. Our study included 62 patients, all of whom had PCT and CRP measured on arrival to ED.",

We also acknowledge that, by limiting mixed infection group to those in whom microbiologically confirmed bacterial diagnosis was made, we may have created a bias.
