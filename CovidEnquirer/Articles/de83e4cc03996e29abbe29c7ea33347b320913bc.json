Viral 57, 328-334). In the present study, the fate of the residual genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide was determined. Nearly all of the genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of drug was inco~orated into nucleocapsid structures, suggesting that even in the absence of protein synthesis, genomic RNA synthesis and encapsidation are coupled in MHV-infected cells. Sufficient free nucleocapsid N protein was available for this purpose, since the pool of soluble N protein was determined to decay with a half-life of approximately one hour.",

In agreement with this prediction, negative strand RNA accumulated during the first 5-B h of infection, with little additional accumulation occurring over the next 2.5 h, In marked contrast, positive strand RNA increased 5-(i-fold over the same 2.5 h period. These results, taken in conjunction with published data, suggest that negative strand RNA is synthesized during the early period of the infectious cycle and is stable in infected cells and also suggest that treatment with cycloheximide at late times does not inhibit positive",

Only full length negative strand RNA has been detected in infected cells (Lai et al., 1982) and presumably serves as the template for both mRNA and previrion RNA.

We also confirmed the results of Sawicki and Sawicki (1986) showing that the syntheses of both genomic and subgenomic RNA were inhibited by cycloheximide at all times after infection, although we found that the synthesis of genomic RNA was slightly more sensitive to protein synthesis inhibition than was that of the subgenomic RNAs. Thus in the experiment shown in Fig. lB (Robb and Bond, 1979; Spaan et al., 1981) which are believed to be the precursors to infectious virus. To determine the effect of cycloheximide on the synthesis of these structures, cytoplasm was prepared from control and drug-treated infected L-2 cells at 5 h p.i. and divided into two parts. A portion of each sample was assayed for the presence of nucleocapsids by sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis. An EDTA-resistant structure sedimenting at about 200 S was isolated (Fig. 1A ) and shown to contain only RNA 1 (Fig. lB) , in agreement with a previous report (Spaan et al., 1981) . Pretreatment with cycloheximide caused approximately an 85% inhibition in the appearance of RNA 1 in the nucleocapsid structure. RNA was extracted from the remainder of each sample and analyzed directly by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B) . Since the syntheses of RNA 1 and viral nucleocapsids were inhibited to nearly the same extent (82% and 85% respectively), this suggested that the residual genomic RNA produced in the presence of cycloheximide was incorporated into nucleocapsids.",

At 5.5 h p.i., negative strand RNA was clearly present with little additional accumulation (less than 2-fold) occurring by 8 h p.i. From this and other experiments, we estimated that negative strand RNA represented approximately 1% of RNA at 5 h p.i. and less than 0.5% at 8 h p.i. We concluded that the inhibition of positive strand synthesis by cycloheximide at late times after infection was most likely not due to a lack of negative strand templates.",

In VSV-infected cells, 50% of N protein is present in the soluble pool after a 2-10 min label and this decreases to 8-25% after 30 min of chase (Knipe et al., 1977; Hsu et al., 1979) . In contrast, in MHV-infected cells, the pool of free N protein is much larger, since 95% of N protein was present in the soluble fraction after a 10 min label, and this decreased to approximately 50% over the next hour. Thus, sufficient N protein exists for the encapsidation of the genomic RNA synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide.",

The synthesis of MHV subgenomic RNA is believed to include synthesis of a leader sequence, which in turn serves as primer for the body of each RNA (Spaan et al., 1983; Lai et al., 1984) . The effect of cycloheximide on subgenomic RNA synthesis may reflect lability either of the viral polymerase or of some protein involved in the synthesis or processing of leader RNA. Similarly, the effect of this drug on genomic RNA synthesis may reflect a lability in one of these proteins rather than a limited supply of N protein.",

Second, negative strand RNA is synthesized maximally at 5-6 h p.i. (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986) and is the chief product observed when viral polymerase activity is assayed at 1 h p.i. in vitro (Brayton et al., 1984) . Third, our results show that negative strand RNA accumulates primarily during the early stages of the infectious cycle. These results together suggest that negative strand RNA is synthesized at early times during the infectious cycle and is a stable species of RNA in infected cells. The results also suggest that cycloheximide does not inhibit positive strand RNA synthesis indirectly via inhibition of negative strand synthesis, since the production of positive strand RNA remains sensitive to cycloheximide at times when the synthesis and accumulation of negative strand RNA is minimal.",
