Such evasion is related to the unstable nature of its RNA, in particular the S glycoprotein encoding gene, which raises great challenges with regard to the control of the disease, along with the lack of proof reading mechanisms of the RNA polymerase. The emergence of new variants might be a reason for the endemic outbreaks that are being reported in Tunisia, in addition to poor vaccination techniques and ineffective prophylactic programs.",

Spe-cific mutations were found in S1 gene as well as in 3 UTR region. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 nucleotide sequences showed that both isolates are closely related to the Algerian strains, and formed a common cluster within the genotype I. In addition, these isolates were non-recombinant ones, confirming that they are unique variants. Based on their S1 gene sequences, TN1011/16 and TN1012/16 strains were distant from the H120 vaccine strain, commercially used in Tunisia along with the variant vaccine 793B type (4/91). A comparison between nucleotide sequences of their 3 UTR region and S1 gene showed a difference in IBV classification. The obtained results have confirmed that the IBVsequence continues to drift and brings valuable information in relation with its evolution, vaccine development and better control of the disease.",

IB has a significant economic impact with production losses related to poor weight gains, condemnation at processing and mortality in broilers, suboptimal egg production and egg downgrading in laying birds (Cook et al., 2012) . Despite the applied intensive vaccination programs, outbreaks re-emerge as a consequence of infections with new variants that differ serologically from the strains used for vaccination (Chen et al., 2010; Leghari et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2018) . Besides, in the absence of a \"standard\" vaccination program against IB, the program recommended by the National Committee for Avian Pathology (NCAP) remains an alternative to prevent avian disease infections. Unfortunately, it appears that there are programs as breeding as reported by Cherif et al. (2010) . This largely explains the variability of protection outcomes and the sustainability of the disease, despite the availability of the latest generation of vaccines.",

The S1 subunit is the major target for neutralizing antibodies and carries serotype-specific antigenic determinants (Liu et al., 2007) . In addition to these roles, recently it was reported that S and 5a accessory gene are responsible for the attenuation of virulent IBV strains (Zhao et al., 2019) . The genome of IBV includes the untranslated regions (UTR) at the 5 and 3 genome 4338 regions, which play a role in RNA synthesis (Sawicki et al., 2007) and classification of IBV (Hewson et al., 2009) . The 3 -UTR is involved in the initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis and has also been used to assess variations in emerging IBV strains and other members of coronavirus group 3 (Williams et al., 1993; Breslin et al., 1999) .",

Indeed, Bourogaa et al. (2009b) conducted experimental trials to evaluate tracheal and renal cross protection in chickens vaccinated by oculo-nasal instillation. The results showed a weak protection when H120 strain was used alone. There were no reduction in tracheal and kidney damage after a challenge with the strain TN20/00. On the other hand, the combination of heterologous serotypes, based on the vaccine strains (H120) and CR88, allowed a higher protection. Thus, a vaccination protocol that combines CR88 with H120 has since been applied. The following years, the variant strain 4/91 has been also introduced.",
