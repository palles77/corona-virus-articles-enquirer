In addition, herd replacements can serve as reservoirs of economically important infectious diseases for the adult herd (eg, Johne's disease or bovine viral diarrhea virus [BVDV]) [7] [8] [9] [10] . The introduction of new pathogens, or the spread of pathogens already present in the herd to new groups of animals, can have a devastating effect on the individual dairy operation [11, 12] . In addition, several infectious disease agents commonly found in dairy heifers are zoonotic and their control has public health implications [13] [14] [15] [16] . The prevention and control of infectious disease in replacement heifers is therefore an important component of any herd health plan.",

The National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) Dairy 2002 study, which represented 83% of United States dairy operations, identified many potential opportunities for improvement in infectious disease control practices on United States dairies [18] . For example, for operations that brought new cattle onto their farms in 2002, only a quarter required testing for any infectious diseases and only half required some form of vaccination history for new herd additions. Almost half of operations did not separate calves from dams immediately after birth, and pooled colostrum was frequently fed, especially on large (500 or more cattle) operations. Only 5% of operations had any written procedures designed specifically to prevent the introduction and spread of new diseases into their herd, apart from those pertaining to milking procedures [18] . Biosecurity considerations seem particularly relevant in today's industry, where it is not uncommon for expanding dairy operations to introduce new animals into the herd [16, 18, 19] , and heifers are increasingly raised off-site with the potential for contact with animals from other herds [18] .",

Customized biosecurity and biocontainment protocols need to be developed for each facility, therefore, and tailored for the control of specific diseases. There is no ''oneplan-fits-all''; a completely closed herd that is free of Johne's disease may require excellent biosecurity with relatively less emphasis on biocontainment procedures, whereas a heifer-rearing operation that purchases calves from a large number of sources is limited in the biosecurity practices that can be applied and has to rely on biocontainment practices to limit disease. The expanding dairy that rears its own replacements needs both biosecurity and biocontainment practices to control the introduction and spread of disease. All herds, small and large, are impacted by infectious disease and are likely to benefit from a formal assessment of risks and the preparation and implementation of a biosecurity and biocontainment plan. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of general considerations for biosecurity and biocontainment at each level of the heifer-rearing enterprise.

Bovine respiratory syncytial virus has been associated with outbreaks of dairy calf pneumonia [30, 31] , but other viral respiratory pathogens seem to play a minor role in respiratory disease in modern calf husbandry systems [3, 30, 32] . Acute BVDV infection can contribute to morbidity in calves because of its immunosuppressive effects, its ability to potentiate the effects of other pathogens, and, less commonly, its direct pathogenic effects [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . In weaned heifers, another important endemic disease is infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK, or pinkeye), caused by Moraxella bovis [38] . With the exception of BVDV, some Salmonella species, some mycoplasmal species, and some specific strains of E coli, the pathogens responsible for most calfhood disease are ubiquitous and are present in a proportion of apparently healthy cattle on most dairy operations [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] .",

Most of these agents survive well in the environment, allowing for efficient indirect transmission [29, 33, [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Given the presence of a particular pathogen on a farm, risk factors for calf morbidity can be divided into those that reduce the ability of the calf to resist disease at a given level of pathogen exposure (eg, failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies; poor nutritional status; stresses, such as transportation, mixing of calves, or heat and cold stress; mixed infections; and inadequate vaccination programs) and those factors that increase the level of pathogen exposure (eg, poor environmental hygiene, deficiencies in housing design and ventilation, high stocking density, and exposure to other groups of cattle). The current understanding of disease epidemiology is incomplete for many pathogens, thus limiting the veterinarian's ability to fully assess exposure risk. For those cases in which the epidemiology is not well understood, the known risk factors for pathogens with similar transmission dynamics, for undifferentiated disease, or for the same pathogen in a different population can help provide guidance for evaluating exposure risk. For example, the importance of environmental contamination, fomites, or transmission by personnel working with calves in the epidemiology of Mycoplasma bovis infection is unknown. We do know, however, that personnel and fomites can be important in the transmission of mycoplasmal mastitis in the milking parlor, and without additional information it is reasonable to assume that these could also play a role in the calf barn.",

In many cases, calves become infected with enteric or respiratory pathogens within the first few days of life [45, [63] [64] [65] . Asymptomatic and subclinically infected cattle shed these pathogens in feces or respiratory secretions and large numbers may be shed by periparturient cows [29, 55, [66] [67] [68] . Neonatal calves often become infected in the maternity area from their dam or other cows by direct contact or exposure to a contaminated environment [55, [68] [69] [70] . Multiple-cow housing presents a greater opportunity for direct and indirect neonatal contact with infected cows than do individual maternity pens; for example, the risk for Cryptosporidium shedding in neonatal calves is higher when they are born in multiple-cow maternity housing compared with individual pens [71] . Maternity areas that are dirty, wet, or dusty increase the risk for calf disease and the risk for periparturient infections in cows [29, 72, 73] . The length of time after birth that calves remain with their dams affects the risk for pathogen exposure and therefore the risk for neonatal disease [20, 29, 42] . For example, in one study of 11 dairies in Ontario, calves remaining in the maternity area for more than 1 hour had 39% higher odds of developing diarrhea than calves separated earlier [44] .",

Contaminated environments, feed or water, fomites (eg, equipment), personnel, or mechanical vectors (eg, flies) are often important in disease transmission [29, 89] . Calves that have clinical disease typically shed the highest numbers of pathogens and are therefore likely to be the most important reservoirs of infection within the calf facility [29, 33] . The housing of susceptible neonates in contact with older preweaned calves or cattle of other age groups increases the risk for pathogen exposure. Virtala and colleagues [85] reported that housing of preweaned calves in the presence of adult cattle increased the risk for calfhood pneumonia, whereas housing in individual hutches was protective.",

The amount of exposure to direct sunlight greatly influences pathogen survival. In general, appropriately spaced individual calf hutches that are cleaned, disinfected, and moved between successive calves offer the best opportunity for limiting accumulation and calf-to-calf transmission of pathogens [73, 86] . For calves housed in a confined airspace, procedures that aerosolize pathogens from dust or feces, such as pressure washing, can increase transmission of enteric pathogens, and inadequate ventilation increases this aerosol transmission [29] . Large numbers of respiratory pathogens can be isolated from the air in barns housing calves that have respiratory disease [3, 33, 90] . Because reduced airborne bacterial counts in calf pens are associated with a reduced prevalence of respiratory disease, factors that influence airborne bacterial counts, such as pen design, barn ventilation, and stocking density, may affect transmission rates [91] . Independent of effects on bacterial load, poor air quality compromises respiratory defenses, which may increase the risk for disease [3] . Other housing factors associated with a reduced prevalence of respiratory disease in naturally ventilated calf barns in winter include the presence of a solid barrier between each pen and increased ability of the calf to nest [91] .",

Little is published on the epidemiology of M bovis within young calf populations, but there are several potential routes of initial exposure. Calves could become infected from their dams or from other adult cows in the maternity area that are shedding M bovis in colostrum, vaginal secretions, or respiratory secretions [60] . The isolation of M bovis from vaginal secretions of cows at calving [102, 103] and congenital infection of calves [104, 105] have been reported, although both events seem to occur infrequently.

Because milk in modern husbandry systems is typically batched for feeding to calves, a single cow shedding M bovis can potentially expose a large number of calves to infection, and calves may be repeatedly exposed over the milk-feeding period. The importance of colostrum as a source of M bovis infection in calves is not well defined. Whatever the mechanism (infected milk, colostrum, respiratory or vaginal secretions, or congenital infection) by which calves become infected, they may then shed M bovis in respiratory secretions and transmit it to other calves by direct or indirect contact. Once established on multiage sites, M bovis becomes extremely difficult to eradicate, suggesting that continual transmission from older animals to incoming calves occurs [63, 99, 106] .",

Distinct serovars and pilus types of Moraxella bovis exist, and new strains can be introduced by exposure to cattle from other herds [38] . The reservoir of infection is asymptomatic carrier cattle that intermittently shed bacteria in respiratory and ocular secretions [38] . The bacteria is highly contagious and transmission occurs by direct contact or, importantly, through mechanical transmission by flies (Musca autumnalis, Musca domestica, and Stomoxys calcitrans) [22, 107] . A large number of risk factors for clinical disease have been identified, including environmental factors (eg, dusty conditions and the amount of ultraviolet light exposure), season, the number of flies that visit the eyes of affected cattle, concurrent pathogens, the host immune status (eg, stress such as transportation can precipitate disease outbreaks), and the virulence of the infecting strain [38] .",

            "text": "Johne's disease is endemic to North America, and the causative agent, Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis (MAP), is widespread in the dairy population. The NAHMS Dairy 2002 study [108] found that the within-herd apparent prevalence of MAP infection based on fecal culture ranged from 0% to 50% in 62 United States herds. Herd-level prevalence was not estimated, but in an earlier NAHMS study, the apparent prevalence of MAP infection was estimated to be at least 22% of United States dairy herds [109] . Transmission occurs primarily by the fecal-oral route, most importantly to a neonatal calf from its dam or from other infected cows in the maternity area [110, 111] . The organism may be shed in colostrum and milk from infected cows, and this can be a route of transmission to calves [110] . Congenital infection occurs occasionally [110] . Susceptibility to infection decreases with age, and young calves are at highest risk for infection. The bacteria can persist for years in the environment and so environmental contamination can be important, especially in the maternity area or other areas to which neonatal calves are exposed [110] . Recent research has suggested that calf-to-calf transmission of MAP may occur when heavily challenged calves are housed in direct contact with naive calves [112] , although whether this is important in the epidemiology of Johne's disease has yet to be determined. A longitudinal study of MAP infection within one herd found that calves co-housed with animals that were later high shedders of the bacteria were at increased risk for infection, also suggesting that calfto-calf transmission may play a role in Johne's disease epidemiology [111] . Well-established risk factors for MAP infection include (1) introduction of infected cattle into the herd, and (2) practices that increase exposure of young replacement heifers to the pathogen, including failure to remove calves from dams promptly after birth, use of multiple-cow maternity areas, feeding of colostrum and milk from infected cows, and exposure of calves to feces of older cattle [46, 113, 114] . Cleaning of maternity pens after each use has been associated with reduced herd-level risk for MAP infection [48] .",

Sick cows are most likely to shed Salmonella [120] , although subclinically infected cattle can shed large numbers of the bacteria [117] . Salmonella spp can also be carried and shed by any species of mammal or bird, and these can be important means of contamination of feed or water [118, 119, 121] . The bacteria survive in the environment for several months and can replicate under certain conditions of temperature and humidity [29, 57, 117] . Established risk factors for Salmonella infection (fecal shedding) in dairy calves include a high prevalence of fecal shedding in the adult herd and frequent or occasional use of the maternity area as housing for sick cows [51] . Separation of hospital and maternity facilities has been associated with reductions in the prevalence of Salmonella spp in herds with endemic infection [52] . The role of antibiotics in Salmonella shedding in calves is unclear; routine feeding of medicated milk replacer or milk replacer containing antibiotics was identified as protective for Salmonella shedding in two large-scale studies [51, 122] . Other investigators identified antibiotic treatment as a risk factor for Salmonella shedding in heifers within herds experiencing clinical outbreaks of salmonellosis [123] . In addition to being shed in feces, Salmonella can be shed in other body secretions, including nasal secretions, saliva, and milk. Infected saliva and nasal secretions can contribute to transmission by direct contact, aerosols, or contamination of shared feed and water sources [29, 124] .",

When transplacental infection occurs during the first 125 days of gestation, it can result in the birth of a persistently infected (PI) calf [125] . Transplacental infection occurs when susceptible cows are exposed to BVDV during pregnancy or when a PI cow becomes pregnant [126] . Persistently infected cattle are the most important reservoir of virus; they shed high amounts of virus and are the most efficient sources of horizontal transmission to susceptible cattle [17, 126, 127] . Infected cattle can shed virus in body fluids, especially saliva, ocular and respiratory secretions, urine, feces, and uterine fluids; horizontal transmission can occur by direct or indirect contact with infected secretions [17, 128] . The virus is unlikely to persist for more than a few weeks in the environment [17] . Exposure to fetal fluids from PI calves, and failing to remove calves from maternity barns where PI calves were being born until 2 to 3 hours after birth resulted in infection of susceptible neonates in one study, emphasizing the need for good maternity pen hygiene and rapid removal of calves in BVDV biocontainment programs [128] .",

At the level of calf facility, the most important means of introduction to and transmission within calf facilities is likely to be the presence of PI calves [17, 126] . Interventions to reduce the occurrence of PI calves and within-herd biocontainment programs to limit spread of BVDV between age groups are likely be the most important components of control once BVDV is present in a herd [129] . Before initiating a BVDV control program it is important to determine the current BVDV status of the herd (reviewed in [17] ). The BVDV control program can then be targeted to within-herd biocontainment and removal of PI animals or to herd biosecurity as needed. The vaccination status of the resident herd and any introduced cattle influences the herd susceptibility to BVDV infection and should be considered when determining biosecurity and biocontainment priorities.",

BLV seems to be widespread in the United States dairy population; the national herd prevalence was estimated at 89% [133] . Herd size, geographic location, and management practices were identified as herd-level risk factors for infection in the NAHMS Dairy 1996 study [133] . BLV transmission generally requires transfer of infected lymphocytes to susceptible cattle, typically by way of blood [134] . A small proportion of infections occur by in utero transmission. BLV is frequently present in colostrum and, to a lesser extent, milk from infected cows, and transmission by these routes has been demonstrated experimentally (reviewed in [134] ). Whether colostrum plays a significant role in the epidemiology of infection is not clear, and some studies have not observed any affect of the BLV status of colostrum on the risk for infection in calves [135] . Maternal antibodies seem to protect calves from early infection, and the feeding of unpasteurized milk in BLV-infected herds can increase the risk for infection in calves that do not have passively acquired antibodies to BLV [136, 137] . Gouge dehorning has been associated with the horizontal transmission of BLV when instruments are not cleaned and disinfected between calves [138, 139] . Other management procedures that could result in blood transfer between calves if appropriate disinfection was not in place include tail docking, removal of supernumerary teats, castration, insertion of growth implants, tattooing, and ear tagging [134] . Use of shared needles or obstetric sleeves could also potentially transmit infected blood between heifers [134] . Hematophagous flies, including tabanid flies, such as horse and deer flies, and the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans), may play a role in horizontal transmission of BLV [134] .",

Most infections are caused by the host-adapted serovar Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar hardjo, although several other non-host-adapted serovars sporadically infect cattle [141] . Chronically infected cattle that shed organisms in urine are the major reservoir of serovar hardjo infection in cattle populations [49, 142] . For other serovars, maintenance hosts (eg, skunks, opossums, and raccoons) shed the organisms in urine, by which they can contaminate the dairy environment [49] . Infection is widespread; a survey of mature United States cows at slaughter found that 2% were renal carriers and 49% had antibodies to leptospires [141] . Transmission of leptospires on dairies is often indirect, through urine-contaminated environmental sources, such as water. Leptospires survive best in the environment when standing water is present, and infection occurs by invasion through intact oral mucosa or water-saturated skin [49] . Elimination of standing water, controlling wildlife and pests, and implementation of an effective vaccination program are the major means of reducing risk from leptospirosis on dairies [49] . Leptospires are zoonotic and farm workers can become infected through direct or indirect contact with infected animals or their urine [143] .",

Areas that should be included are the management of purchased animals or replacements returning from off-site locations; maternity barn management; colostrum management; housing of calves and environmental hygiene; milk feeding practices; feed and water management; practices that could increase the risk for pathogen transmission by fomites, vehicles, and personnel; vector control; vaccination programs; record keeping; monitoring of disease and performance data; and the use of written biosecurity and biocontainment protocols.",

Despite this, data from the 2002 NAHMS study showed that only 52.9% of dairy operations separated calves from dams immediately after birth and did not allow nursing, whereas 22.2% allowed calves to suckle but removed them before 12 hours of age, 15.9% removed calves between 12 and 24 hours, and 8.7% removed calves sometime after 24 hours [18] . The longer the cow-calf interaction, the greater the chance for pathogen transmission by way of feces, respiratory secretions, a contaminated environment, or ingestion of colostrum that contains pathogens. Udder-seeking behavior is likely to increase pathogen exposure, and so removal of the calf before standing is desirable. Although labor intensive, removal of the calf immediately after birth should be a cornerstone of biocontainment in herds where control of neonatal calf diarrhea, calfhood respiratory disease, or Johne's disease have been identified as priorities.",

Clean udders (clipped before calving, clean and dry maternity area) and good milking hygiene during colostrum collection are important to prevent contamination with pathogens, especially those spread by the fecal-oral route. Pooling of colostrum should be avoided unless it is to be pasteurized, because it increases risk for exposure to pathogens. In some situations it may be advantageous to avoid feeding colostrum from high-risk cows. For example, in herds infected with MAP, only colostrum from low-risk cows (test-negative, no clinical signs of disease) or pasteurized colostrum should be fed [149] . For the control of BLV, feeding of colostrum from seronegative cows in herds of low BLV prevalence, or freezing of all colostrum in higher prevalence herds is recommended; freezing kills leukocytes and therefore reduces the chance of BLV transmission [47] . Bloody or mastitic colostrum should not be fed. Pathogen-specific colostral antibody titers and neonatal protection against some infectious agents can be enhanced by proper vaccination of cows during late gestation [150] [151] [152] .",

Movement of calves should always be unidirectional; that is, calves should never be moved back from an area housing older calves to an area housing younger calves [20] . If animals have to be removed from a group because of injury, ill thrift, or chronic disease, they should be housed in a hospital area that is specific for postweaned calves.

On larger farms, specific people should be designated for the removal of calves from the maternity area and colostrum feeding. These people should not handle cattle of other groups or should change into clean outer clothing or coveralls before entering the maternity area. Hands and boots should be cleaned and disinfected before handling each newborn calf. If the same person is responsible for handling cows and calves in the maternity area, the calf should be handled first. Footbaths should be used to enter and leave maternity areas, each section of calf housing, and hospital facilities. In calf facilities, staff should always work with the youngest, most susceptible calves first. Sick calves should be handled last; if possible, have separate people handle sick calves and neonates. After handling sick calves, hands and boots should be thoroughly washed and disinfected; ideally, separate outer clothing should be worn in the calf hospital area. Gloves should always be worn to assist calves to nurse and to handle sick calves, and these should be changed after each calf. During a disease outbreak, it is important to consider all animals in the group or facility as potential sources of infection, not just those that are clinically ill.",

Only 13.5% had a ''no visitor'' policy and few operations provided footbaths (5.4%) or clean or disposable boots (16.3%) for visitors [18] . Veterinarians should arrive at the calf facilities wearing clean coveralls and should disinfect boots between areas of the farm.

Producers should be aware of the need to discuss any unusual health events (eg, unusual clinical signs, increased incidence of clinical disease, reduced performance, or potential biosecurity lapses) with their veterinarian. Biosecurity and biocontainment protocols should be reviewed regularly and adjustments made as priorities change. Effective monitoring is essential to determine whether biosecurity and biocontainment practices are working. For example, if a BLV control program is established with the goal being to raise seronegative heifers, then regular monitoring of the serologic status of replacements is necessary to determine if the goal is being met. When a disease outbreak occurs, infection control practices should be reviewed with all personnel. Possible areas of biocontainment lapses should be identified and changes made to prevent future lapses. If a particular practice is not working, find out why and look for other solutions, or remove it from protocols.",

A formal, written biosecurity and biocontainment program should be prepared and should be accessible so that it can be referred to as needed. Signs can be posted at critical locations to remind staff and visitors to follow particular practices (eg, to use the footbath). Incentives to aid in staff cooperation may be effective.
