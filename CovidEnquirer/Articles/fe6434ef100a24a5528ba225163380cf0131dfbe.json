Residual virus replication was assayed at 2 days post infection as described (3). The highest serum dilution giving a 90% reduction of luciferase activity was regarded as the ppNT antibody titer.",

            "text": "probe-based real-time PCRs targeting upstream of E gene (UpE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1a were used as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). We also tested each specimen with broad-range reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) conserved across the coronavirus family to detect other coronaviruses. The nucleic acid extraction methods, primers, and PCR testing protocols used have been described(1).In brief, nucleic acid was extracted from 140-\u03bcL aliquots of swab supernatants usingQIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Viral RNA was eluted in 60 \u03bcL elution buffer provided in the kit, and 12 \u03bcL was used for preparing a 20-\u03bcL reverse transcription reaction with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) produced was subjected to the detection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) by using probe-based real-time PCRs targeting UpE and ORF1a as recommended by WHO. For the upE qPCR, a 15-\u03bcL reaction was set up containing 1 \u03bcM of each of the forward (5\u2032-GCAACGCGCGATTCAGTT-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-GCCTCTACACGGGACCCATA-3\u2032) primers, 0.5 \u03bcM probe (5\u20326-FAM/CTCTTCACATAATCGCCCCGAGCTCG/3\u20326-TAMSp), and 2 \u03bcL cDNA in 1\u00d7 reaction buffer (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). The reaction was carried out in ViiA 7 real-time PCR system (Life Technologies) with 40 cycles of amplification. For the ORF1a quantitative PCR, the reaction was set up as above except with forward primer (5\u2032-CCACTACTCCCATTTCGTCAG-3\u2032), reverse primer (5\u2032-CAGTATGTGTAGTGCGCATATAAGCA-3\u2032), and probe (5\u20326-FAM/TTGCAAATTGGCTTGCCCCCACT/3\u20326-TAMSp) targeting the ORF1a gene. Cycle threshold was generated by the ViiA7 system automatically with default settings. The full genome of MERS-CoV in dromedary camel swab samples was deduced by sequencing PCR amplicons with overlapping sequence reads. Genome sequence of the virus was constructed by concatenating the amplicon sequences obtained. The sequencing was done with 3-4 times coverage. Genes of the dromedary MERS-CoV was identified by ORF prediction and with reference to published human MERS-CoV genomes. Dromedary MERS-CoV genomes were aligned with human MERS-CoV genome sequences retrieved from GenBank. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by using MEGA5 with neighbor--\u03bcL aliquot of original sample was filtered through 0.4-\u03bcm filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and 100 \u03bcL aliquots of neat 1:10 diluted and 1:100 diluted samples were inoculated into Vero E6 cell (ATCC CRL-1586) in T25 flasks with \u224880% confluence. The inoculated cells were kept in minimum essential medium without fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 6 days. The cells were examined daily to detect virus cytopathic effect (CPE). Upon appearance of CPE, or at day 6 if no CPE was observed, the cells were harvested and passaged for a second time in Vero E6 cells. The cells and supernatant of flasks showing CPE was harvested, aliquoted, and stored at \u221280\u00b0\u00b0C.",
