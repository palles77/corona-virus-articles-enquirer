Plasma proteins in the complex are responsible for the colloidal osmotic effect necessary to maintain blood volume. Other important functions of plasma proteins are the buffer function of the blood pH (15%-20% of the total buffering capacity), transport of hormones, transport of drugs, and blood clotting. Different types of proteins are indispensable for the inflammatory reaction, the immune reaction, and for the process of healing and tissue repair. So, it is easily understood that the measurement of plasma proteins and the determination of their alterations may constitute an important method for assessing the health condition of a patient. Human medicine, such as the dog and cat's, has taken advantage for decades of this valuable diagnostic tool. With exotic species, progress in the interpretation of the alteration of plasma proteins has been more discontinuous and irregular. Despite this, the usefulness of this test is indisputable. This article analyzes the different applications of plasma protein electrophoresis in small mammals, birds, and reptiles.",

In several exotic species, especially of small size, the need to work with small volumes of blood requires the clinician to collect the blood with an anticoagulant (frequently natrium heparin or lithium heparin, sometimes heparinizing the syringe to avoid the coagulation of the sample during collection); therefore, centrifugation is achieved in plasma. The main difference between the 2 products is the absence in the serum of fribrinogen, the protein involved in the processes of coagulation; the concentration of total solids of the plasma is thus slightly higher than that of serum (about 5%) and the electrophoretic pattern from it will result in a higher incidence of b-globulin fraction where the fibrinogen normally migrates. In clinical practice, the normal plasma protein concentration is measured very simply by using a refractometer: a few drops of blood are collected in a heparinized capillary whose centrifugation gives the value of the microhematocrit (percentage of blood occupied by cells compared with plasma) and a small amount of plasma. Refractometry of that plasma allows easy estimation of the concentration of total solids. This method is simple and intuitive; however, it is not reliable if the sample quality is poor. Among the factors that interfere with the measurement of total solids by refractometer include hemolysis, lipemia, hyperbilirubinemia, azotemia, severe hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, and administration of colloids, including synthetic hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. In the absence of these factors, the amount of nonprotein solids present in plasma is relatively constant, therefore by subtracting the nonprotein component (1.5 g/dL) the value of total plasma proteins is obtained.",

The decrease in total solids (hypoproteinemia), vice versa, may reflect overhydration, decreased synthesis of albumin or immunoglobulin, or protein loss associated with hemorrhage, vasculitis, nephropathy, or enteropathy. With the exception of bleeding, which causes a loss of balanced albumins and globulins, in all pathologies involving protein loss albumin concentration falls to a greater extent than that of the globulins because of lower dimensions of the molecule, which allow easier migration through vascular endothelia. The measurement of total protein is certainly very useful, but for the purposes of a diagnosis that is as accurate as possible, it becomes essential to know the alterations of each protein fraction. For this purpose is used the characteristic of plasma proteins to be separated based on their charge and the consequent mobility in an electric field specially created. This method defines electrophoresis of proteins. The distribution of protein migrants on strips of cellulose acetate or agarose gel is represented graphically by a curve in which the extension and the height of each peak is corresponding to the breadth and the density of each protein fraction on the substrate migration.",

Laboratory data have shown that a single cycle of freezing does not alter the electrophoretic pattern, whereas prolonged freezing determines a variation in the albumin/globulin ratio in favor of the latter. The serum of the rabbit contains, as in other mammals, various protein fractions: albumin, a-globulins, b-globulins, and g-globulins. The a-globulins and b-globulins are generally divided into subunits of a1 and a2, and b1 and b2 (Fig. 1) . Albumin constitutes the main fraction responsible for the oncotic pressure of body fluids, whereas the a1-globulin, a2-globulin, b-globulins, and g-globulins are a smaller fraction responsible for the humoral response of the organism.

Despite being defined as an APP, it is also found in the course of chronic processes. 9 Placed inside a magnetic field (principle of electrophoresis of proteins), because of its shape, weight, and molecular electrostatic charge, such protein migrates to the right (toward the anode or negative electrode) in the area of b-globulins and g-globulins to influence the path. Other APPs, such as aptoglobulina, a1 acid glycoprotein, and ceruloplasmin are normally found in the a and b fractions. In course of encephalitozoonosis we have seen a decrease of albumin, primarily because of the increased synthesis by hepatocytes of numerous immunoproteins (especially Ig) with consequent widening of the electrophoretic band in the region of b and g. The b-globulin and g-globulin can be found in course of chronic inflammatory processes (like bacterial, viral, or fungal infections), parasitism (E cuniculi), cancer, or immunemediated diseases. In the specific case of protozoal infection by E cuniculi, healthy animals and seropositive animal SPE patterns only differ significantly in the g fraction. 10 Results are very similar to those obtained by Didier in 1995, in a study of dogs showing clinical signs of encephalitozoon infection. 11 The hypergammaglobulinemia during encephalitozoonosis is usually mild to moderate; this value may be altered when rabbits with impaired immune response come in contact with the parasite, which may react with a decrease of circulating IgG and a possible increase in IgM. 12 The titration of IgM and IgG allows us to clarify the response against the parasite carried by the body at the time of collection. IgM increases usually in the early stages when the parasite exerts its action, decreasing up to be absent on the 38th day, whereas IgG increases more slowly in the course of infection but remains detectable for years. 13 The changes of g-globulin have been shown to not be significantly different in animals with IgM titratable compared with animals with IgG increased. This shows that the hypergammaglobulinemia is an artifact resulting in a chronic inflammatory process. In support of this theory, it is believed that the organism remains latent in the body until it occurs in a suppression of the immune system, a phase in which the body eliminates spores in the urine. 14 Contrary to what occurs in avian species, and in accordance with what occurs in dogs, hemolysis increases the b fraction, not the g fraction.",

The most characteristic alteration is described in patients suffering from Aleutian disease. This disease, fortunately is infrequent (but certainly underdiagnosed) in Italy, is caused by a parvovirus (ADV) that affects the Mustelidae family, including mink and ferret. It is transmitted by feces and all body secretions and is particularly insidious because it evolves as a chronic disease, debilitating the ferret to the invariably fatal outcome. Aleutian disease causes lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and precipitation of immune complexes in various tissues from which a variety of symptoms is shown by sick animals. Blood tests are often vague, showing nonregenerative anemia, abnormal liver enzymes, and uremia; however, electrophoresis is revealing. Patients with ADV in fact have a marked hyperproteinemia with values up to 10 to 12 g/dL or more, but at the same time an important hypoalbuminemia: g-globulins rise instead to constitute 20% to 60% of total protein, drawing a characteristic \"horned\" path and seriously altering the A/G ratio. Other diseases can cause hypergammaglobulinemia, although not as marked as ADV: other viruses such as influenza or distemper, pyoderma, kidney diseases with no protein loss, certain tumors, and systemic mycoses (Blastomycosis, Coccidioides spp). Another, more frequent, viral disease is catarrhal enteritis (ECE) caused by a coronavirus: kits are often asymptomatic carriers for adults who become instead gravely ill. In case of ECE, electrophoresis is characterized at the beginning by moderate hypoalbuminemia, which becomes more and more severe during the following weeks. Following the evolution of the disease, an increase in a2 or b1 may be noticed, meaning the production of IgA in the acute phase, then a peak of gammaglobulines even if significantly below that of ADV. After the second or third week, there is often hypogammaglobulinemia, evidence of the failure of the immune response.",

In the case of hepatic neoplasia, often the protein curve does not differ much from that of a healthy animal, except for a modest elevation of a2-globulins. More marked is the alteration in case of hepatic lipidosis and acute cholangitischolangiohepatitis, when the increase of a2-globulins is greater and reflects an intense inflammation. Chronic hepatitis and cholestasis phenomena, intrahepatic or extrahepatic, are reflected instead in a b-globulin peak, where transferrin, C-reactive protein, and generally the IgM migrate. The decrease in the percentage of globulin is uncommon and is usually associated with renal failure or lymphoma. The hypoproteinemia usually indicates a defect in protein synthesis and has a negative prognostic value. 15 ",

Clinically healthy guinea pig serum proteins are separated into 7 sections: albumin, a1-globulin, a2-globulin, b1-globulin, b2-globulin (often divided into 2 peaks), and g-globulins, and in some subjects prealbumins have been occasionally signaled (Fig. 3) . The area occupied by b-globulins and g-globulins in the complex is restricted in comparison with the well-developed area of the a-globulins and A/G ratio is high. By immunoelectrophoresis, up to 30 different protein migrants in those areas can be individuated, although not all were necessarily present in the same sample. An interesting study describes the changes in the electrophoretic pattern during the evolution of experimentally induced tuberculosis infection in a group of guinea pigs. 16 At the end of the first week, the electrophoretic pattern was still virtually unchanged, whereas at the fulfillment of the second, a large majority of individuals showed a marked increase in a2-globulins and the appearance of a new peak in the same region, characteristic of sick individuals and never found in healthy ones, named a2-T. At the third week, the a1 started to decrease whereas a2 increased further with increasing importance of a2-T peak, which persisted until the death of the subjects. More detailed studies have identified this protein as a glycoprotein, not macroglobulin. It is interesting to note that the response to tubercular infection occurs in the region of a2 in several species, including humans. Guinea pig lipoproteins tend instead to migrate in the b-globulin peak. The same study also analyzed the serum of guinea pigs inoculated with killed mycobacteria: the electrophoresis of these subjects showed no increase of a2-globulins nor the appearance of a2-T, which can then be considered the sign of an organic reaction to the pathogen, but all the samples at the third week after inoculation showed a marked hypergammaglobulinemia. In another study, reaction to infection by Entamoeba histolytica was investigated, which consisted of hypoalbuminemia and increase of a-globulins and b-globulins. 17 The importance of electrophoresis in the diagnosis of spontaneous disease in the guinea pig and chinchilla is currently studied: patterns from clinically healthy individuals are shown as a starting point for further observations (Fig. 4) .",

            "text": "The first studies of serum proteins in birds were performed on domestic chickens, showing many similarities with the layout of mammals (eg, the production of APPs 18, 19 ), but also several differences: the widespread presence of prealbumin, for example, the lowest concentration of g-globulin, and conversely the more marked response to inflammatory stimuli in the b-globulin field. Unfortunately for the needs of clinical practice, however, not only may the electrophoretic patterns of parrots differ from those of chickens, 20 but significant differences are found also among the different species of Psittaciformes (Figs. 5-10) . This variability has led some investigators to doubt the possibility of obtaining reliable results by electrophoresis in avian species, especially with regard to the differentiation between the various globulin fractions. 21 The answer to this question is probably a better standardization of the techniques of electrophoresis and graphical representation, as well as a better understanding of the normal values of the different species. Normally, electrophoresis of birds is run on plasma samples obtained from heparinized blood: the percentages are derived from densitometric analysis of each protein fraction deposited on the gel and absolute values (g/dL) calculated by multiplying the percentage of each fraction for the value of total protein obtained from the refractometer. The pattern of the normal chicken shows a marked peak of albumin, and globulins are divided between the b-globulin (IgM, IgA) and g-globulin (IgG): transferrin, APP, migrates mainly in the b-globulins. In birds, the albumin protein fraction is undoubtedly preeminent; an interspecific important difference is noted in the group of prealbumin. Whereas in some species, such as the African gray, prealbumin is nearly or totally absent, similar to chickens, other species, such as the budgerigar or the monk parakeet (Myopsitta monachus), may have even more prealbumin than albumin. Conventionally, the A/G ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of prealbumin 1 albumin for the sum of the globulins. According to some investigators, however, it may be more correct to subtract the prealbumin, because it is not properly albumin and even a globulin. The opinion of the author is that this precaution not only is of little practical value but also potentially counterproductive, being that prealbumin, as albumin, has a negative APP and therefore its quantification, when present, has validity in the diagnosis of acute inflammation.

Diseases in which we expect massive increases in g-globulin are chronic diseases such as chlamydiosis or mycobacteriosis.

Approximately 30% of patients suffering from aspergillosis show cyclical peaks in the b-globulins area, and only a small percentage show hypergammaglobulinemia. The normal response to a chronic inflammatory process is the production of a wide variety of antibodies that are expressed in a series of g-globulin peaks or, more commonly, in a single peak with a large base: this phenomenon is named polyclonal gammopathy. In some cases, however, a single or very few immunoglobulins are massively produced, a phenomenon that is expressed in a peak-to-narrow base similar to that of albumin and is defined oligoclonal or monoclonal gammopathy.

Conversely, a freezing of the sample did not show adverse effects. Hemolysis is a phenomenon unfortunately present when sampling blood from small patients and difficult to control. In the dog, the products of hemolysis tend to migrate in the b-globulin region; conversely, those of birds seem to migrate primarily in the region of g-globulin. This may be attributable to a structural difference of the protein or by a different technique analysis. 22 Lipemia is another frequent alteration especially in the serum of some South American species (Amazona spp, Miopsitta, Pionus spp): the electropherogram of a lipemic sample shows an artificial elevation in the region of b-globulins. In contrast, the b-globulins would be below the normal values related in the literature, in which serum would be used in place of plasma because the fibrinogen (absent in serum) migrates essentially in the b region. 26 This is, however, the only significant difference between the tracks from the 2 different spin cycles.",

            "text": "The use of electrophoresis in reptiles is still sporadic and most of the available data are anecdotal; nevertheless, they are interesting as a first element for future study. Serum proteins of reptiles migrate in a manner quite similar to those of birds and are divided on the track in the fractions of albumin, a1-globulin, a2-globulin, b-globulins, and g-globulins. Prealbumin appears in some species (eg, Geochelone radiata and some turtles), in which it presumably has the same function of transport as in other animals. Albumins are also the preponderant portion of the curve in reptiles, whereas the globulins as a complex, like in birds, are in minimal concentration in healthy subjects. 28 In the fraction of a-globulins and b-globulins migrate mainly APPs and complement, whereas the g-globulins are circulating antibodies; both b-globulin and g-globulin can configure a single peak or two. Even in the absence of standardization, it can be seen how the electrophoretic pattern changes in subjects markedly ill compared with healthy subjects in reptiles as well. In an iguana (Iguana iguana) with evidence of osteometabolic disease, for example, is frequently observed the decrease of albumins and the marked increase in b globulins (APPs) that indicates suffering hepatic and renal function as a cause or consequence of the metabolic problem. 28 The alteration of the ratio A/G is one of the most interesting parameters to observe and evaluate, as it can reveal a dysproteinemia even in the presence of a normal value of total protein, thus inducing the clinician to further investigation. An important obstacle to the use of electrophoresis, as well as the biochemistry as an assessment of the health status of a reptile, is the marked variability linked not only to the species but also to temperature, ambient humidity, photoperiod, and in general to the season, that for heterothermic animals has much more influence on homeostasis than in homeothermic animals. Only the collection of an adequate volume of data will clarify the actual diagnostic value of this test in reptiles.",
