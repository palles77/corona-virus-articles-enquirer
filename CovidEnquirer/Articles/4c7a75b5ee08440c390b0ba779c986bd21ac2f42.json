            "text": "The nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) is a major structural component of virions, which appears to be a multifunctional protein involved in viral RNA replication and translation. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is related to the pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translation regulation in the cytoplasm. In this report, based on the relevant biophysical and biochemical assays, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS_CoV (SARS_N) was discovered to exhibit high binding affinity to human hnRNP A1. GST pull-down results clearly demonstrated that SARS_N protein could directly and specifically bind to human hnRNP A1 in vitro. Yeast two-hybrid assays further indicated in vivo that such binding relates to the fragment (aa 161-210) of SARS_N and the Gly-rich domain (aa 203-320) of hnRNP A1. Moreover, kinetic analyses by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology revealed that SARS_N protein has a specific binding affinity against human hnRNP A1 with K D at 0.35 \u00b1 0.02 lM (k on = 5.83 \u00b1 0.42 \u00b7 10 3 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 and k off = 2.06 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b7 10 \u00c03 s \u00c01 ). It is suggested that both SARS_N and hnRNP A1 proteins are possibly within the SARS_CoV replication/transcription complex and SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction might function in the regulation of SARS_CoV RNA synthesis. In addition, the determined results showed that SARS_N protein has only one binding domain for interacting with human hnRNP A1, which is different from the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) binding case where the nucleocapsid protein of MHV (MHV_N) was found to have two binding domains involved in the MHV_N/hnRNP A1 interaction, thereby suggesting that SARS_N protein might carry out a different binding mode to bind to human hnRNP A1 for its further function performance in comparison with MHV_N.",

It has been known that SARS coronavirus (SARS_CoV) is responsible for SARS infection [1] [2] [3] [4] , and further research showed that SARS_CoV belongs to one member of the Coronaviridae and is moderately related to the other known coronaviruses [5] . SARS_CoV has 11 open reading frames (ORFs) that encode 23 putative proteins including four major structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M), and small envelope (E) proteins [5, 6] . The N protein of SARS_CoV (SARS_N) is a highly basic structural protein localized in the cytoplasm and the nucleolus of Trichoplusia ni BT1 Tn 5B1-4 cells [7] . Previous studies have indicated that the N proteins of other coronaviruses are extensively phosphorylated and associated with viral RNA to form a helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) that comprises the viral core structure [8] . Recently, we discovered the fact that SARS_N tightly binds to human cyclophilin A, which might provide a new hint in understanding the possible SARS_CoV infection pathway against human cell [9] .",

On the other hand, the genome sequence analysis for SARS_CoV has revealed that the transcription-regulating sequences at 5 0 end of each gene involve such partially conserved core sequence [5] . Structurally, SARS_N owns the SRXX repeated region that shares high similarity with that of MHV_N protein according to the sequence analysis.

Research has indicated that hnRNP A1 behaves as a global regulator of alternative pre-mRNA splicing by antagonizing the activities of several serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SR protein), thus resulting in the activation of Abbreviations: SARS_CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; N protein, nucleocapsid protein; SARS_N, the nucleocapsid protein of SARS coronavirus; hnRNP A1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1; MHV, mouse hepatitis virus; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; IPTG, isopropyl-b-D D-galactoside alternative distal 5 0 splicing sites and skipping of optional exons [12] . In structure, hnRNP A1 contains two RNA-binding domains (RBDs) and a glycine-rich domain that is responsible for protein-protein interaction. hnRNP A1 selectively interacts through its gly-rich domain with different RNA-binding proteins, especially some splicing factors (SR proteins) [13, 14] . It was proved that hnRNP A1 was involved in MHV RNA replication and transcription, certainly regulating RNA synthesis of a cytoplasmic virus [11] . A recently published paper demonstrated that the nucleocapsid protein of MHV could interact with hnRNP A1 [15] . Since SARS_N is able to bind to RNA [16] and also shares some homology with MHV_N, we think that during the SARS_CoV life cycle SARS_N might also possibly interact with human hnRNP A1 for mRNA synthesis and mature mRNA transporting and transcription.",

The pGEX4T-1-hnRNP A1 vector was transformed into BL21 (DE3) Escherichia coli (Novagen). Overnight cultures of a single colony per 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 lg/ml ampicillin were diluted to 1:10 with the same medium. After 3 h when the OD 600 reached 0.7, expression of the protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG, and cultures were incubated for 5 h at 22\u00b0C with aeration. Cells were recovered by centrifugation, quick-frozen, and stored overnight at \u00c080\u00b0C. Frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in 15 ml of the PBS buffer (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 1.8 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.4) containing 5 mM EDTA and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol per gram of cells, and then lysed by sonication for 20 min in ice bath. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with PBS buffer. The loaded column was washed by 200 ml PBS buffer at 4\u00b0C. GST-hnRNP A1 was eluted using 10 mM reduced glutathione freshly added to PBS buffer. The glutathione contained with the purified protein was removed by dialysis against PBS buffer. The purified protein was detected as a single band on SDS-PAGE gel, and protein concentration was measured by the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient of 66990 l/mol/cm.",

During the assay, SARS_N protein was immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip as ligand in 2000 RU according to the standard amine-coupling wizard. The control flow cell was activated then blocked directly without immobilizing any protein to eliminate non-specific interaction between hnRNP A1 and the sensor chip surface. The purified human hnRNP A1 protein was prepared in a series of concentrations as analyte then injected into Biacore 3000. The binding level (measured in RU) of human hnRNP A1 to the immobilized SARS_N rose and reached saturation with the increasing concentration ( Fig. 2A) , which demonstrated again that human hnRNP A1 protein can directly bind to SARS_N in vitro. The association of SARS_N with hnRNP A1 could be described in a simple equilibrium: A \u00fe B () AB. The kinetic parameters (the equilibrium dissociation constant, K D ; association rate constant, k on ; and dissociation rate constant, k off ) of the SARS_N/hnRNP A1 protein-protein interaction were determined by the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. As such, the evaluated curves were found to fit the experimental curves very well ( Fig. 2A ) and the fitting reliability was also reflected by the small chi 2 and residuals (Fig. 2B) . The K D for SARS_N/ hnRNP A1 interaction was thus simulated as 0.35 \u00b1 0.02 lM with k on = 5.83 \u00b1 0.42 \u00b7 10 3 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 and k off = 2.06 \u00b1 0.12 \u00b7 10 \u00c03 s \u00c01 , which quantitatively revealed the high binding affinity of SARS_N against human hnRNP A1.",

These fragments, designated from DN1 to DN5, were cloned into pGBKT7 vector, and then co-transformed respectively with pGADT7-hnRNP A1 into the AH109 yeast cell. After 96-h growth in high stringency nutrition medium (SD-LTH + 10 mM 3-AT) at 30\u00b0C with shaking, 300 ll cells were transferred into the 96-well microplate. The growth curves of these cells were then evaluated by measuring their absorbance at 595 nm in the 96well microplate. As indicated in Fig. 3B, DN1 (aa 81-422) and DN2 (aa 161-422) showed viability compared to the empty control, thus suggesting that these two segments of SARS_N protein have binding affinities to human hnRNP A1. It is noted that deletion of the fragment from aa 1 to 211 of SARS_N resulted in the loss of its binding activity to human hnRNP A1 as indicated by the fact that no viability was detected for DN3 (aa 211-422), DN4 (aa 291-422) and DN5 (aa 211-350). This therefore suggested that the interacting fragment of SARS_N protein involved in the SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction is most probably within the segment of aa 1-211. In addition, it is found that the growths of both DN1 (aa 81-422) and DN2 (aa 161-422) are close to each other but a little less than that of the full-length N, it seems that the N terminal 80 amino acid residues of SARS_N might be involved in SARS_N/hnRNP A1 interaction. To validate this possibility, we made two truncated fragments for SARS_N, DN2 0 (aa 1-160) and DN3 0 (aa 1-210). As indicated in Fig.   3B , DN2 0 had no binding affinity to human hnRNP A1, while DN3 0 could bind to human hnRNP A1, which thereby indicates that the N terminal 80aa fragment does not participate in the SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction and the segment of aa 161-210 of SARS_N is indispensable for this protein-protein interaction.",

It has been reported that this SRXXrepeat fragment of MHV_N is within the MHV_N/hnRNP A1 interaction parts [15] . Therefore, encouraged by these facts, we supposed that the SRXX-repeat fragment of SARS_N might be also involved in the SARS_N/hnRNP A1 interaction.

The curves of this peptide binding to the immobilized GST-hnRNP A1 (flow cell was immobilized with GST as control) were shown in Fig. 4A . The binding affinity of this peptide to the human hnRNP A1 protein was thus evaluated as K D at 148 \u00b1 12 lM by the steady-state fit model. To further confirm this specific binding of this SARS_N SRXX-repeat domain to hnRNP A1, we also performed an inhibitory experiment by using this peptide to inhibit hnRNP A1 interaction with the immobilized SARS_N protein through Biacore 3000. As shown in Fig. 4B, 100 and 625 lM of this peptide did perturb 10 lM hnRNP A1 binding to SARS_N protein, which thereby suggested that the SRXX-repeat fragment of SARS_N does contribute to the SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction.",

            "text": "In the present study, by employing a series of biochemical and biophysical methods, we have firstly reported that SARS_N protein has a specific binding affinity to human hnRNP A1, and the further yeast two-hybrid assay demonstrated that the C-terminus of human hnRNP A1 and the fragment aa 161-210 of SARS_N probably contribute to the SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction. Since both human hnRNP A1 and SARS_N proteins bind to RNA and implement their functions in RNA replication and transcription [11] , we thus tentatively proposed that, together with the bound RNA, SARS_N might probably interact with the human hnRNP A1 to form a complex in the regulation of the transcription and replication of SARS_CoV according to the reported model for MHV [11] . Therefore, it seems that the cross talk between human hnRNP A1 and SARS_N protein might be essential for SARS_CoV replication and transcription. Additionally, SARS_N protein binds to the C-terminus of human hnRNP A1 and cooperates with hnRNP A1 to recruit more proteins in forming the transcription or replication complex. As such, the C-terminal-deletion mutant of human hnRNP does not interact with SARS_N and fails to bring it into the initiation complex, possibly resulting in the failure of SARS-CoV RNA replication and transcription.",

            "text": "In addition, the yeast two-hybrid result has clearly indicated that only one fragment of SARS_N (aa 161-211) is required for SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction, which is different from the MHV_N case where MHV_N has two domains, aa 1-292 and aa 392-455 that are involved in its binding to hnRNP A1 [15] (Fig. 5) , suggesting that MHV_N/hnRNP A1 interaction seems to be stronger in comparison with SARS_N/hnRNP A1. As we know, the fragment aa 161-211 contains SRXX-repeat domain that is multifunctional and conserved in N protein of coronaviruses [19] . In this work, the fact that the synthesized SRXX-repeat peptide has weak binding affinity (K D = 148 \u00b1 12 lM) to human hnRNP A1 ( Fig. 2A) suggests that the SRXX-repeat segment of SARS_ Nis involved in but does not dominate the SARS_N/human hnRNP A1 interaction, which is also within the similar binding feature of this corresponding fragment in MHV_N (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, it has been recently reported that SRXX-repeat fragment is indispensable for SARS_N multimerization [20] and for SARS_N interaction with SARS_CoV membrane protein [19] . All these facts have indicated that SRXX-repeat fragment of SARS_N protein might play a potent role in SARS_CoV infection, even though more studies should be addressed in exploring how SARS_N regulates itself to adapt its interaction with the different partners. In conclusion, our data have shown for the first time both in vitro and in vivo that the nucleocapsid protein of SARS coronavirus has a high binding affinity to human hnRNP A1, and such a protein-protein interaction involves the region aa 161-210 of SARS_N and the C-terminus aa 203-320 of human hnRNP A1. Based on the analytical results for MHV, it is suggested that both SARS_N and human hnRNP A1 proteins might be among the SARS_CoV replication/transcription complex and their interaction may be involved in the regulation of SARS_CoV RNA synthesis. The fact that there is only one instead of two human hnRNP A1-binding domain in SARS_N indicates that the SARS_N protein interaction with human hnRNP A1 for SARS_CoV might take a different binding type compared with that for MHV, which is possibly due to the low sequence homology for SARS_CoV relative to other coronaviruses.",
