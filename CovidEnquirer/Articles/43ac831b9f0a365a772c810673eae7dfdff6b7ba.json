            "text": "Murine hepatitis viruses provide excellent animal models for the study of virus-induced diseases of the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Several studies have indirectly provided evidence that the spike glycoprotein (S) of these coronaviruses bears determinants for pathogenesis and the induction of protective immunity. In order to directly evaluate the immunogenicity of this protein, it was purified by affinity chromatography with an in vitro neutralizing and in vivo protective monoclonal antibody which immunoprecipitated the 180-kDa spike glycoprotein of the neurotropic A59 strain of murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). Mice immunized twice with approximately 1 ag of purified S in Freund's adjuvant developed high titers of neutralizing and fusion inhibiting antibodies, even though the protein was at least partially denaturated after elution from the affinity column. Moreover, these mice were protected from lethal encephalitis when challenged intracerebrally with 10 LDso of MHV-A59. This study provides a direct demonstration of the importance of the coronavirus spike giycoprotein in the induction of a protective immune response. o 1SSoAcademic press. Inc.",

In order to directly evaluate the involvement of the whole glycoprotein in the immune response against coronaviruses, the MHV-A59 S glycoprotein was purified by affinity chromatography and its immunogenicity ascertained in mice. We show that in addition to the induction of high levels of neutralizing and fusion-inhibiting antibodies, immunization with S alone was able to protect mice from lethal encephalitis induced by experimental MHV-A59 infection, despite the loss of the native protein conformation.",

After another 4 days, immune spleen cells were fused with nonsecretor myeloma cells P3-X63-Ag8.653 at a ratio of 5:l with polyethylene glycol 1000 (Sigma, St-Louis, MO). The cell suspension was cultured in 96-well plates (2.5 X lo5 cells per well) in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1 mn/l sodium pyruvate, 2.5 pg/ml fungizone, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 pg/ml streptomycin (GIBCO Canada, Burlington, Ontario). This medium was supplemented with 100 &I hypoxanthine, and 16 & thymidine for the first 4 weeks, and 0.4 &I aminopterin (Sigma) for the first week. The medium was screened for the presence of virus-specific antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Talbot et al., 198413) . Cells in positive wells were cloned by limiting dilution, expanded, and rechecked. Ascites of positive clones were produced in pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane)-primed BALB/c mice. The specificity of the MAbs for viral proteins was determined by radioimmunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled MHV-A59-infected DBT cell lysates as described below, as well as by Western immunoblotting (Talbot et al., 1984a) . Epitopes recognized by some antibodies were topographically mapped by competitive ELISA as described previously (Talbot et al., 198413) except that biotinylated antibodies (Guesdon et a/., 1979) and streptavidin-peroxidase (Sigma) were used. The sensitivity of these epitopes to denaturation by ammonium isothiocyanate (NH,SCN) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was determined by dot immunoblotting (Talbot et a/., 1984a) , with the modification that phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 was used as blocking and washing buffer.",

Moreover, our results on the immunogenicity of purified S show that despite a loss of native conformation, the protein has conserved some critical determinants. This could be expected in view of our previous study where a synthetic peptide was shown to vaccinate against MHV-JHM infection (Talbot et al., 1988) .",

            "text": "It should be interesting to verify in further experiments how the loss of some determinants on purified S, which has been partially denaturated, could modify the pathogenicity of virus after challenge of vaccinated mice. Sturman eta/. (1985) showed that cleavage of S activates cell fusing properties of MHV-A59 virions and that the two subunits, which were isolated by hydroxyapatite chromatography, both had a molecular mass of 90 kDa. On the other hand, we have observed that the purified monomeric forms consistently migrated on SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular masses of 96-97 and 87-88 kDa. These sizes correlate to those estimated from the nucleotide sequence of the MHV-A59 S gene (Luytjes et a/., 1987) . From this sequence, the molecular mass estimates are 79.8 and 66 kDa for subunits Sl (previously designated 90B) and S2 (previously designated 90A), respectively, both derived from a 146-kDa apoprotein. Assuming that the remaining 34-kDa of carbohydrate residues are added equivalently to each subunit, which both contain 10 potential N-gly-cosylation sites, the subunits obtained should have molecular masses of 97 and 83 kDa, which is consistent with the sizes reproducibly observed in our experiments. It is possible that the use of gradient gels allows the separation of such closely migrating species. Thus, the use of preparative linear gradient gels should allow the separation of the S monomers, albeit in their denatured forms. It is also possible that the growth of MHV-A59 in DBT cells leads to a different glycosylation pattern which yields two subunits of different molecular masses, unlike virus grown in L2 cells (Sturman et a/., 1985) .",

Moreover, further studies are needed to evaluate the biological importance of the 65-kDa HE viral protein which has been associated with hemagglutination and esterase activities (Luytjes, 1989) , although its presence in the nonhemagglutinating MHV-S strain (Talbot, 1989) is not consistent with a viral hemagglutinin. The relative contributions of these viral proteins and their in viva interaction will therefore need to be clarified in order to better understand the molecular basis of coronavirus pathogenesis.",
