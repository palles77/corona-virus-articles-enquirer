Identification of causative agents in severe nonbacterial pneumonia is very challenging. Microbiological culture of lower respiratory tract specimens, blood and lung tissue is considered as the gold standard for etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia. However, for viruses and atypical pathogens, culture analysis is rarely used due to delay in the results and complicated procedures. [4] [5] [6] [7] While serological tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting specific pathogens are routinely deployed, their clinical usefulness is limited in identifying a novel or rare pathogen and mixed infections. 8, 9 It has been reported that causative agents cannot be confirmed in nearly half of pneumonia episodes despite careful testing. 10 Thus, anti-infective therapy is empirically applied based on clinical features and thoracic images in the early stage of pneumonia, which may increase the rate of treatment failure and cause drugrelated toxicity. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a comprehensive assay system for prompt etiologic diagnosis of severe pneumonia.",

Without any clear indications of causative agents, antibiotic treatment is usually determined empirically, which may cause severe drug resistance, higher cost and increased mortality risk. Therefore, microbiological tests are strongly recommended for patients with severe pneumonia, in whom the probability of changing the empirical treatment is high, to reduce treatment failure and prevent antibiotic overuse. 10, 17, 18 As the gold standard of etiologic diagnosis, microbiological culture is not efficient in severe pneumonia due to its time-consuming procedures and high incidence of false negative results. 19 More importantly, culture analysis is rarely used to detect viruses and atypical pathogens due to delay in the results and complicated procedures. PCR and serological tests are popular due to the high-speed and capacity of processing large quantities of samples at the same time; however, they are not suitable for detecting novel/rare pathogens or mixed infections. Therefore, additional techniques that could facilitate etiologic diagnosis of severe pneumonia are urgently needed, especially when initial empirical anti-infective therapy has failed. In the present study, our data demonstrated that TEM had a good sensitivity in detecting nonbacterial infectious agents in BALF. The combined use of serological tests with TEM improved the detection rate of nonbacterial pathogens. Furthermore, it has been reported that mixed infections, defined as at least 2 types of pathogens contained in 1 sample, occur in more than half of cases of community-acquired pneumonia and are associated with more severe inflammatory disorders. 20, 21 Interestingly, based on our data, TEM appeared to be far more sensitive in detecting mixed infections when compared with serological tests. In spite of these combined detection modalities, the overall rate of treatment failure was 20 of 106 (18.9%) in this study, which we thought was caused by severe systemic complications and antibiotic resistance.",

            "text": "TEM has been widely used in diagnostic microbiology for decades. Even though the clinical usefulness of TEM has been gradually declined as the popularization of molecular and immunological techniques, it offers significant advantages in the detectability of viruses and atypical pathogens and the capacity of detecting multiple pathogens present within a sample by a single test. 13 Moreover, TEM examination of BALF samples only takes 48 hours, which means that clinical physicians could get fast information of what kind of infectious agents are existing in the lungs of patients. Unlike serological test and PCR, TEM does not require any organism-specific reagents for detecting pathogens. 9 However, there are several drawbacks to the TEM technique. First of all, samples must be processed individually for TEM examination, leading to a low throughput. The field of view under TEM is also relatively small, increasing the possibility that the region analyzed may not be representative of the whole sample, which could cause false negative results. In addition, the accuracy of TEM examination is dependent on the skill and experience of microscopists. Thus, in this study, 2 experienced electron microscopists were involved in imaging analysis of each sample to avoid misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the diagnostic value of TEM in bacterial pneumonia is limited, because routine TEM cannot differentiate bacterial strains and provide any information of antibiotic sensitivity, thus, had few benefits to subsequent antibiotic therapies. So far, advanced electron microscopy (EM) techniques have been applied to microbiology in basic and clinical studies, including cryogenic electron tomography, immuno-EM, 22 3-dimensional EM, 23 correlated light microscopy and TEM. 24 When TEM is integrated with immunohistochemistry or other molecular labeling techniques, it would become practical for electron microscopists and clinical physicians to distinguish various pathogens on the strain level under TEM. 25 Recently, rapid methods of sample preparation and transportable EM equipment, which makes EM an easier and faster tool to use, have also been reported to improve the identification of infectious agents. [26] [27] [28] These studies and our data collectively support that in future, TEM may be used along with other diagnostic tools, as one part of a comprehensive assay system for microbiological diagnosis of severe pneumonia. Several imitations should be noted in the present study. First of all, no BALF samples from healthy volunteer subjects were obtained, which made the diagnostic specificity of TEM unevaluable and the interpretation of TEM examination difficult, which we plan to address in future studies. In addition, the major disadvantage of TEM used in this study was that it did not identify a pathogen on the strain level. Hopefully, the application of more advanced techniques and combined use with other microbial tests would enhance the diagnostic accuracy of TEM, thus further improving its diagnostic value. Moreover, even though TEM examination of BALF appears to have a potential utility in improving diagnostic sensitivity in severe pneumonia caused by nonbacterial pathogens, its cost-effectiveness is still unknown. Therefore, clinical trials with large patient numbers must be conducted to determine whether the implementation of TEM could benefit patients with severe pneumonia through promoting the prompt initiation of anti-infective treatments.",
