To address this critical question, a method was developed for virus discovery based on a flexible nested-PCR subtraction hybridization. As a positive control, we used hepatitis C virus as a hypothetical unrecognized virus and \"discover\" it in the sample. Using template-switching universal long-PCR to produce large quantities of cDNA, our nested-PCR-based subtractive hybridization coupled with a single-strand deletion technology removed most of the common cDNA. Following subtraction hybridization, a cDNA library was constructed and displayed by differential reverse dot blot hybridization. This new genomic subtraction hybridization method will be ideally suited to identify rapidly any previously unrecognized viral agent. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

By the time a new virus, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus, is found, it is too late to save the lives of many individuals even thousands. For longer-term solutions, a powerful molecular technique is needed to rapidly identify any previously unrecognized viral agent without using virus isolation. Such a method could then be applied for investigation of future outbreaks. The most recent technologies for detecting and identifying previously unrecognized pathogens are differential display, representational difference analysis, subtractive hybridization, expression library screening, broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serial analysis of gene expression. But they are all time-consuming and not very reproducible approaches (Allander et al., 2001) .",

Basically, subtraction hybridization is a subtractive DNA enrichment technique. These methodologies all have in common that one DNA population (the driver) is hybridized in excess against a second population (the tester) to remove sequences present in both populations, thereby enriching target sequences unique to the tester. In theory, under standard conditions, subtraction hybridization has second order kinetics of hybridization (C/C 0 = 1/1 + KC 0 t) (where K is the second-order hybridization rate constant, C is the surface concentration of cDNA, and C 0 is the initial concentration of cDNA in solution) (Miner et al., 1995; Towery et al., 2001; Wang and Drlica, 2003) .
