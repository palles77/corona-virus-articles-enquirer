Of 41 patients initially screened, 10% lacked an available haploidentical donor, 29% had elevated donor-specific antibodies (DSAs), and 34% declined to proceed to HSCT. All 10 patients who were transplanted received peripheral blood stem cells. The initial 2 were conditioned with alemtuzumab/total body irradiation (TBI) 3 Gy followed by post-transplant cyclophosphamide and failed to engraft. The next 8 patients received the regimen developed at Johns Hopkins University with TBI 3 Gy. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was administered from day +12 in those with HbS < 30%. All 8 patients engrafted with a median time to neutrophil >.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L of 22 days (range, 18 to 23). One patient subsequently lost the graft, and 7 (87.5%) maintained >95% donor cell chimerism at 1-year post-HSCT. Two patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of at least grade II. One had chronic GVHD and died >1 year after HSCT of unknown causes. With a median follow-up of 16 months (range, 11 to 29), 7 patients (87.5%) are alive. Our findings suggest that limited insurance coverage, high rate of DSAs, and patient declining HSCT may limit the availability of haploidentical HSCT in adult SCD patients. The modified Hopkins regimen used here demonstrates high engraftment and low morbidity rates and should be tested in larger, multicenter, prospective clinical trials.",

This strategy was used in 14 SCD patients transplanted with bone marrow cells after conditioning with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI), antithymocyte globulin, and GVHD prophylaxis with PTCy on days +3 and +4; mycophenolate mofetil for 30 days; and tacrolimus or sirolimus for at least 1 year (the Hopkins protocol) [8] . No severe transplantrelated complications were reported, and 57% of patients achieved a stable donor cell engraftment. In a subsequent study the same regimen resulted in the engraftment of only 2 of 5 SCD patients [9] . Modifications to this regimen, including the addition of azathioprine and hydroxyurea for 3 months pre-HSCT, hypertransfusion, and thiotepa on day -7, improved engraftment to 91%, with 18% acute GVHD and 14% mortality in a pediatric series of SCD patients [9] .",

The conditioning was as follows: rabbit antithymocyte globulin (Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) (.5 mg/kg on day -9, 2 mg/kg on days -8 and -7), cyclophosphamide (14.5 mg/kg on days -6 and -5), fludarabine (30 mg/m 2 on days -6 to -2), and single-dose TBI 3 Gy on day -1.

Medical insurance denial accounted for 20% of the lack of access for HSCT. Other factors, such as high rates of DSAs in frequently transfused SCD patients and personal decisions to decline HSCT, also played significant roles. Our rate of available haploidentical donors is lower than was previously observed at Johns Hopkins University, where 90% of SCD patients referred had haploidentical donors [8] . This difference may be because many of the SCD patients reported on here were already being followed in our clinics and had not been prescreened or selected by referring physicians. The presence of DSAs is a major barrier to haploidentical HSCT in SCD that should be addressed when discussing treatment options with patients. A possible strategy to increase the donor pool could be to select patients with low DSA titers and a negative cross-match result. Desensitization protocols used in hematologic malignancies [11] should also be tested in clinical trials for SCD patients with clinically aggressive disease. Our findings are consistent with a previous report showing that a substantial proportion of eligible SCD patients do not proceed to HSCT because of fear of toxicity and satisfaction with the current quality of life [19] . The 2 main reasons that patients reported for declining HSCT were the risk of GVHD in an HLA-mismatched HSCT and the toxicity associated with chemotherapy in the conditioning regimen. Interestingly, in previous studies the severity of SCD was not associated with the degree of risk that a parent or a patient is willing to accept for cure [20] [21] [22] [23] . Only 35% of adolescents and 46% of parents would accept HSCT if recommended by their hematologist [24] . Thirty-two percent of adolescents believe that SCD will shorten their life span, and only 26% believe that SCD will prevent the achievement of life goals, which is in contrast to 86% of adults who perceived that employment opportunities are affected by SCD [21, 24] . There is a need for better education of patients about the course of SCD and for large, prospective haploidentical HSCT studies to guide the decisions of patients and their families for the risk-tobenefit assessment of HSCT. The risks of curative treatment with alternative donors will need to be carefully considered as new therapies, such as gene therapy [25] and nontransplant therapies [26] , are being developed for SCD.",

Concern for the safety of G-CSF was highlighted in a previous case series of 11 SCD patients receiving G-CSF to reduce the duration of neutropenia after chemotherapy or to mobilize autologous stem cells [27] . In that case series 7 of 11 patients had serious adverse events with G-CSF use, and a lower HbS level did not reduce the rate of adverse events. In contrast, in a pediatric cohort of children with SCD undergoing matched related donor HSCT, G-CSF 5 \u03bcg/kg/day was safely given starting on day +7 until full neutrophil recovery [28] . Only 1 patient in our study had mild lower extremity pain while receiving G-CSF consistent with tolerability of G-CSF post-HSCT in SCD. Although sickle cell trait donors did not experience any severe side effects with G-CSF mobilization, an alternative strategy to mobilize stem cells in sickle cell trait donors and to mobilize autologous stem cells from SCD patients may be the use of plerixafor, as safely demonstrated in gene therapy studies [29] .",

This study has been partially supported by a Michael Reese Research & Education Foundation endowment to D.R.Conflict of interest statement: There are no conflicts of interest to report. is a well-recognized complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Many therapeutic options are available to treat this condition, including erythropoietin, rituximab, bortezomib, plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, donor lymphocyte infusion, mesenchymal stem cells, antithymocyte globulin, and high-dose steroids; however, treatment outcomes are often variable and can sometimes lead to disappointing results. In this brief article we report our experience with 2 patients with PRCA after major ABO-incompatible HSCT who were resistant to multiple therapeutic interventions and who eventually benefited from treatment with eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin mimetic approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura or severe aplastic anemia refractory to immunosuppressive agents or not eligible for HSCT. Data from these 2 patients show that eltrombopag was effective in treating erythroid aplasia and transfusion dependence after HSCT in patients who did not benefit from multiple previous treatments. Moreover, eltrombopag was well tolerated, with only a transient thrombocytosis requiring dose adjustment and no evidence of clonal evolution. Based on the positive results obtained in these 2 patients, we suggest that eltrombopag may have a favorable effect on unilineage cytopenias such as PRCA. Further studies in a large proportion of patients are mandatory to confirm these preliminary results.",
