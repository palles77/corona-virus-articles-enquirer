Several proteases hydrolysed all or some of the membrane glycopolypeptide (M; M, 30K ) and removed about 1.3K of peptide from the amino-(N-)terminus plus both glycans, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-terminal analysis of [ 3 H]isoleucine-labeiled M after hydrolysis by bromelain revealed that the first nine residues had been removed. After the virions had been permeabilised with saponin, a further 2.5K decrease in molecular weight was produced and this was shown to be from the carboxy-(C-)terminus.",

S2 but not Sl was cleaved to a major glycopolypeptide of approximately 71 K by several proteases, and to 76K by trypsin. N-terminal sequencing of the 71K glycopolypeptide revealed that it had the same N-terminus as intact 52. After hydrolysis in the presence and absence of saponin it was concluded that 52 is very sensitive to hydrolysis near its carboxy terminus at residues close to the outer membrane surface.",

Preliminary studies using the protease bromelain indicated that M protruded only a little at the outer virion surface while most of S was exposed (Cavanagh, 1981) . S comprises two glycopolypeptides. Sl and S2 (Cavanagh, 1983b) , derived from a precursor glycopolypeptide (Stern and Sefton, 1982a) . One function of S2 is to anchor S in the membrane (Cavanagh, 1983~) . Studies with another coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), have indicated that part of M protrudes at the inner membrane surface where it probably interacts with the ribonucleoprotein (Sturman et al., 1980; Rottier et al., 1984) . The purpose of the present study was to determine if proteases could be used to elucidate further the location of the M and S glycopolypeptides of IBV. To enable proteases to enter the virions the virus membrane was permeabilized using the nonionic detergent saponin (Weigel et al., 1983) .",

(Saponin was included so as to be able to obtain hydrolysis of all S2 molecules, as described below.) Edman degradation revealed isoleucine residues at positions 15. 24 and 25 from the N-terminus of ~19.2 (Fig. 4A ). As explained in the Discussion this indicates that ~19.2 lacked the first 9 N-terminal residues present on intact M. As described below the hydrolysis of S2 was enhanced in the presence of saponin and the cleavage sites appeared to be adjacent to the outer membrane surface. Consequently it was necessary to demonstrate that the additional hydrolysis of M in the presence of saponin was a consequence of the removal of residues from the C-terminus of M. To achieve this IBV-M41 was labelled with [35S]methionine and [ 3H]glucosamine in order to label the glycans of M, the potential glycosylation sites of which are known for IBV-Beaudette to be located at residues 2 and 5 from the N-terminus (Boursnell et al., 1984) . After exposure of the virus to several proteases in the presence and absence of saponin the 35S/\"H dpm ratios were calculated. The ~27-28 generated by papain, subtilisin and V8 protease had virtually the same 35S/3H ratio as the unhydrolyzed M (Table 1 ). indicating that the glycans had not been removed. ~21.7 generated by bromelain was not associated with glycans; the small amount of \"H in ~21.7 was probably associated with amino acid residues, since a similar \"S/jH ratio was obtained for the non-glycosylated N polypeptide (Table 1 ). These results confirm that in the presence of saponin the proteases removed peptides from the C-terminus of M and indicate that this might be located in the lumen of the virion. ",

            "text": "Variability in the Sl and S2 content of IBV-Beaudette preparations precluded the use of this strain for study of the effect of proteases on Sl and S2. Thermolysin and elastase had no effect on Sl or S2 when added to virions of IBV-M41. Papain, which in the presence of saponin did hydrolyze M, had no effect on Sl or S2 in the presence or absence of saponin (Fig. 1, m-o) . Chymotrypsin hydrolyzed some Sl and S2 to give 4 products which ranged from approximately 61-74K; the extent of hydrolysis was not increased in the presence of saponin (not shown). Bromelain (Fig.  1, b) , subtilisin (Fig. 1, k) , proteinase K and pronase E (not shown) in the absence of saponin cleaved some of S2 but none of Sl. Electrophoresis of samples in one slab gel showed that the molecular weight of the polypeptides generated was very similar for all four enzymes; the mean M, from 17 determinations was 71.0 f 1.2 (~71). Only with bromelain was the majority of S2 sometimes cleaved while very little of S2 was cleaved by pronase E. In contrast, bromelain (Fig. 1, c) , subtilisin (Fig. 1, I) , and proteinase K (not shown) hydrolyzed most or all of S2 to p71 in the presence of saponin. The amount of S2 cleaved by pronase E was greater when saponin was present (not shown). After 30 min at 37\u00b0C trypsin had hydrolyzed little or no S2 in the absence of saponin (Fig. 1, q) although a small proportion of S2 had been hydrolyzed to a 76.1K glycopolypeptide (~76.1) after 4 h (not shown). No further hydrolysis of S2 was obtained when 20 mg/ml of enzyme was used at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. Addition of saponin resulted in the hydrolysis of a greater proportion of S2 (Fig. 1,  r) . In some instances the ~71 band was more intense than the S2 band from which it was derived. This was because S2 forms a broader band than p71 (and Sl). Purified S was also treated with proteases with and without saponin. Bromelain (Fig. 1, c) . subtilisin (Fig. 3, b) , pronase E (Fig. 3 , d) and proteinase K (not shown) hydrolyzed all of S2 to ~71 plus lesser amounts of smaller glycopolypeptides. Some S2 was hydrolyzed at least twice by 0.02 mg/ml of papain to glycopolypeptides of approximately 75K and 71K (Fig. 3 , f) whereas with 0.2 mg/ml of papain only the 71K product was observed (Fig. 3, g) . Trypsin hydrolyzed most of S2 to ~76.1 while some was cleaved further to p71 (Fig. 3, i) . The presence of saponin with the purified S did not increase the extent of hydrolysis of S2 by papain (0.02 mg/ml) or trypsin (not shown).",

This is confirmed by the finding that ~21.7 generated by proteases lacks glycans. Nucleic acid sequencing of the IBV-Beaudette M gene has shown that there are only two potential glycosylation sites of the type Asn-X-Thr/Ser in M, at positions 2 and 5 from the N-terminal (Boursnell et al., 19X4) ; partial amino acid sequencing has shown that the N-termina1 methionyl residue is not present in the virion-associated M protein (Cavanagh et al., 1986) . The difference in M, of 7K between the 23K non-glycosylated M precursor and the major glycosylated form of 30K indicates that both glycosylation sites are linked to glycans. In this communication several proteases are shown to be able to remove a glycopeptide from the N-terminus of M, such that the large fragment of M had an M, of about 1.3K less than that of the 23K unglycosylated M polypeptide. N-terminal sequencing of ~19.2 generated from the M of IBV-M41 by bromelain showed that isoleucine residues (I, in single-letter amino acid code) were present at positions 15. 24 and 25 from the N-terminus of ~19.2 (Fig. 4A) .

Using proteinase K and saponin they observed that approximately 2.5K and 1.5K of polypeptide were removed from the N-and C-termini. respectively. The similarity of the results obtained after treatment of IBV and MHV with proteases correlates well with the prediction, derived from nucleotide sequence analysis, that the tertiary structure of the IBV and MHV M polypeptide is very similar (Armstrong et al., 1984 : Boursnell et al., 1984 . The hydrophobic sequence nearest the N-terminus of MHV M protein starts at residue 25 in contrast to residue 20 for IBV. The apparent difference in molecular weight of the peptide moiety removed from the N-terminus of the IBV and MHV polypeptide may thus reflect a real difference in the amount of polypeptide which protrudes at the outer membrane surface of these two viruses. In addition to the similar hydrophobic character of the N-terminal half of the IBV and MHV M polypeptide. nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that the C-terminal half is neither strongly hydrophobic nor hydrophilic in both viruses. The C-terminal half of M may, therefore, be adjacent to, but not completely buried in. the inner surface of the virus membrane (Armstrong et al., 1984) . The finding that the C-terminal end of M was hydrolyzed only in the presence of saponin suggests that the last 20-25 or so residues are exposed in the lumen of the virion. It cannot be ruled out completely, however. that these residues might be in the membrane and be exposed when saponin was present.",

            "text": "The finding that urea removed Sl but not S2 from IBV led to the proposal that S2 anchored S in the viral membrane (Cavanagh, 1983~) . This conclusion has been strengthened by nucleotide sequence analysis of the spike precursor gene of IBV-Beaudette (Binns et al.. 1985) which is of the same serotype as IBV-M41. The 71 C-terminal residues (M, 7.7K) comprise a hydrophilic tail (27 residues) followed by a 44 residue stretch with a very hydrophobic character. This arrangement is typical of the membrane-anchoring sequences of the spike proteins of several other viruses. The M, of S2 minus the C-terminal 71 residues is approximately 76.3K. Trypsin hydrolyzed S2 of IBV-M41 to a glycopolypeptide of 76.1K, especially in the presence of saponin. Inspection of the IBV-Beaudette sequence shows that the first target residues for trypsin (arginyl and lysyl) after the 44 residue highly hydrophobic sequence are at positions 72. 76 and 81 from the C-terminus (Binns et al., 1985) . Cleavage at one or more of these residues would result in the generation of a peptide of 71-80 residues of M, about 8-9K and a large glycopolypeptide of about 75-76K. Since trypsin did generate .such a glycopolypeptide. especially with saponin present, and since these basic residues are conserved in IBV-M41 (M.M. Binns. pers. comm.), this suggests that S2 was cleaved in the region of 71-80 residues from the C-terminus and that this region is close to but possibly not completely exposed at the outer membrane surface. The presence of a protease sensitive site near the point of membrane insertion is a feature of the HA2 glycopolypeptide of the influenza virus haemagglutinin (Brand and Skehel. 1972) . The HA, of A/Hong Kong/l968 influenza virus is cleaved by bromelain at a position which is 10 residues away from the uncharged anchoring domain (Wilson et al., 1981) . The sites at which hydrolysis generates the 71K glycopolypeptides may be only a few residues upstream from the proposed trypsin cleavage site. S2 has a potential glycosylation site 88 residues from the C-terminus.",
