These manifest with mild symptoms like the common cold in adults and with more severe disease in infants, the elderly, and the immunosuppressed. In November 2002, unusual cases of \"atypical pneumonia\" of unknown cause occurred in Foshan City, Guangdong province, in China, where many health care workers became infected. 1 The infection was brought to Hong Kong on February 21, 2003 , by a physician who had looked after similar cases of atypical pneumonia in mainland China, leading to subsequent outbreaks of severe pneumonia in Hong Kong and labeled by WHO as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome\" on March 15, 2003 . [3] [4] [5] Several months elapsed and several hundred cases of SARS were observed before SARS-CoV was identified. A novel b CoV (SARS-CoV) of lineage B was confirmed as the cause of the atypical pneumonia cases on March 22, 2003. 4 The SARS-CoV epidemic spread to 29 countries and regions, and it was evident that the global public health, medical, and scientific communities were not adequately prepared for the emergence of SARS. Chains of human-tohuman transmission occurred in Toronto in Canada, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, Chinese Taipei, Singapore, and Hanoi, Viet Nam. The history of the SARS epidemic was short and WHO declared the end of the SARS epidemic in July 2003. There were a total of 8096 SARS cases (which included 774 deaths) 4 reported from 29 countries and regions. 5 Fig. 1 shows the geographic map of distribution of SARS cases.",

In March 2003, a novel group 2b b CoV was confirmed as the causative agent responsible for SARS-CoV infection. 4, 8, 9 The genome sequence of the SARS-CoV did not bear close relationship to any of the previously identified CoVs. 10, 11 SARS-CoV genome consists of 5\u0374 methylated caps and 3\u0374 polyadenylated tails. The partially overlapping 5\u0374 terminal open reading frame 1a/b (ORF1a/b) is within the 5\u0374 two-thirds of the CoV genome and encodes the large replicase polyprotein 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab. These polyproteins are cleaved by 3C-like serine protease and papain-like cysteine protease to produce nonstructural proteins, such as RNA polymerase and helicase, which are important enzymes involved in the transcription and replication of CoVs.

One example is that, despite the abundant expression of ACE2 in vascular endothelial cells and intestinal smooth muscle cells, SARS-CoV was not detected in these cells, whereas it was found in colonic enterocytes and hepatocytes without ACE2 expression. 23, 24 Histology Several autopsies of patients with SARS showed the predominant pathologic finding as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Lung histopathology in patients with SARS included DAD, loss of cilia, squamous metaplasia, denudation of bronchial epithelia, giant-cell infiltrate, with a marked increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium. ACE2 may contribute to the development of DAD. SARS-CoV infections and the S glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV could reduce ACE2 expression. In the mouse model, injection of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein worsened acute lung injury (ALI) in vivo that could be reduced by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway. 25 In addition, overexpression of SARS-CoV proteins such as 3a and 7a, which were expressed in the lungs and intestinal tissues of patients with SARS, could induce apoptosis in vitro. 26, 27 Splenic atrophy of the white pulp, hemophagocytosis, hyaline membranes, and secondary bacterial pneumonia were observed. 28, 29 Lesions resembling cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) in subpleural regions were also seen. 30 Extensive expression of SARS-CoV antigen in type I pneumocytes in cynomolgus macaques experimentally infected with SARS-CoV was noted at day 4, suggesting that type I pneumocytes might be the early primary target for SARS-CoV infection. 31 Diarrhea was present in up to 70% of SARS cases. 24, 32 In specimens obtained by colonoscopy or postmortem examination, active viral replication was noted within the small and large intestine with minimal architectural disruption. SARS-CoV infection was confirmed by viral culture of these specimens, while SARS-CoV RNA was detected in the stool specimens for almost 10 weeks after illness onset. 24 The presence of diarrhea and mortality were associated with a higher nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV viral load on day 10 after illness onset. 33 ",

            "text": "While innate and acquired immune responses enable containment of virus and mild disease, cytokine dysregulation, viral cytopathic effects, downregulation of lung ACE 2, abnormal immune responses, and autoimmune mechanisms may lead to more severe disease and death, disease progression in SARS may be related to activation of T-helper (Th1) cell-mediated immunity and hyperinnate inflammatory response. 28, 32 Marked increases in the Th1 and inflammatory cytokines (interferon-g [IFN-g], interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, and IL-12) were noted for more than 2 weeks after illness onset in a study of 20 adults with SARS-CoV infection, together with marked increases in chemokines such as Th1 chemokine IFN-g-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), neutrophil chemokine IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). 34 In mice infected with SARS-CoV, T cells played an important role in SARS-CoV clearance, whereas a reduced T-cell response contributed to severe disease. 35 In another study of mice infected with SARS-CoV, robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type I IFN (IFN-I) response was observed orchestrating inflammatory responses and lung immunopathology with reduced survival, while early administration of IFN-I ameliorated immunopathology. This delayed IFN-I signaling was thought to promote the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages, leading to elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular leakage, and impaired virus-specific T-cell responses, whereas genetic ablation of the IFN-ab receptor or inflammatory monocyte-macrophage depletion protected mice from fatal infection, without affecting viral load. 36 In addition, Toll-like receptors (TLR) signaling through the TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing INF-b (TRIF) adaptor protein might play a role in protecting mice from lethal SARS-CoV disease based on a study of the innate responses in mice. 37 TLR3(\u00c0/\u00c0), TLR4(\u00c0/\u00c0), and TRIF-related adapted molecule [TRAM](\u00c0/\u00c0) mice were more prone to SARS-CoV infection than wild-type mice, although there was only transient weight loss without mortality. In contrast, mice deficient in the TLR3/TLR4 adaptor TRIF were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, with marked weight loss, more pathologic conditions of the lung, higher viral titers, impaired lung function, and mortality. In TRIF(\u00c0/\u00c0) mice infected with SARS-CoV, distinct changes in inflammation occurred including excess infiltration of neutrophils and inflammatory cells that correlated with increased pathologic conditions of other known causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Aberrant proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and INF-stimulated gene signaling programs were observed following infection of TRIF(\u00c0/\u00c0) mice that resembled those seen in human patients with poor clinical outcome following SARS-CoV infection. These findings suggest the importance of TLR adaptor signaling in generating a balanced protective innate immune response to highly pathogenic CoV infections. 37 In addition, SARS-CoV M protein may function as a cytosolic pathogen-associated molecular pattern to stimulate IFN-b production by activating a TLR-related TRAF3-independent signaling cascade. 38 A case-control study conducted in Chinese patients with SARS-CoV infection and healthy controls has shown that genetic variants of IL-12 receptor B1 (IL12RB1) predispose to SARS-CoV infection. 39 Another case-control study has shown that mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a key molecule in innate immunity that functions as an ante-antibody before specific antibody response, contributes to the first-line host defense against SARS-CoV, and that MBL deficiency is a predisposing factor to SARS-CoV infection. 40 In macaques infected with SARS-CoV, there is evidence that anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) causes severe ALI by altering macrophage inflammation-resolving response in infected lungs. In acutely infected macaques, there was functional polarization of alveolar macrophages, demonstrating wound-healing and proinflammatory characteristics simultaneously. However, the presence of S-IgG before clearance of virus aborted wound-healing responses and promoted production of IL-8 and MCP1, with recruitment of proinflammatory monocytes/macrophages. Interestingly, the sera of patients who had succumbed to SARS-CoV infection enhanced SARS-CoV-induced MCP1 and IL-8 production by human monocyte-derived wound-healing macrophages, whereas blockade of the Fc-g receptor reduced such effects. The findings reveal a mechanism responsible for virus-mediated ALI and define a pathologic consequence of viral-specific antibody response, in addition to providing some insight on a potential target for treatment of SARS-CoV. 41 ",

A 26-year-old man (and visitor who had stayed on the 9th floor of Hotel M), who was admitted to a general medical ward 8A of the hospital with fever and pneumonia on March 4, 2003, 45,46 led to 138 subjects (including previously healthy health care workers) contracting the disease within a 2-week period after exposure. An overcrowded medical ward environment, inadequate air changes in the hospital ward, and the administration of nebulized salbutamol to the index patient via a jet nebulizer, for its mucociliary clearance effects, seem to have contributed to this superspreading event. 45, 46 SARS-CoV was detected in respiratory tract secretions, urine, feces, and tears of some patients with SARS-CoV infection. 44, 47 Computational fluid dynamics analysis in conjunction with investigation of the temporal-spatial pattern of spread of SARS-CoV infection among in-patients on the affected medical ward 8A, implicated airborne transmission. 48 A multiagent modeling analysis of 1744 scenarios was used to examine the contribution by different modes of transmission in the ward 8A outbreak and found that SARS-CoV most likely had spread via the combined long-range airborne and fomite routes, while fomites played a nonnegligible role in the transmission. 49 In Toronto, SARS-CoV was found on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of environmental air samples taken from a hospital room occupied by a patient with SARS-CoV infection, as well as from conventional surface swabs taken from a bed table, a patient's television remote control, and a medication refrigerator door at a nurses' station. 50 The possibility of airborne transmission as indicated by the data emphasizes that it is imperative to take appropriate respiratory protection in addition to strict surface hygiene practices.

SARS-CoV and creation of infectious aerosols that moved upward through the warm airshaft of the apartment building may have been because of dried up U-bend drainage on a bathroom floor and backflow of contaminated sewage (from a SARS patient with renal failure and diarrhea), in combination with negative pressure generated by the toilet exhaust fans. It was suggested via computational fluid dynamics modeling that long-range airborne transmission (>200 m) to nearby buildings was possibly caused by wind flow dispersion. 56",

A single negative test in an upper respiratory specimen does not rule out the diagnosis. Because viral kinetics demonstrated an inverted V-shape curve peaking on day 10 of illness with progressive decrease in rates of viral shedding from nasopharynx, stool, and urine (which might persist up to day 21), clinical progression during the second week was thought to be related to immune-mediated lung injury. 32 Specimens for viral culture require processing in biosafety level 3 facilities, but the results take too long to assist acute clinical management. Serologic diagnosis is largely retrospective and useful for epidemiologic surveillance purposes. A more robust IgG response was observed in severe SARS-CoV infections as reflected by higher IgG levels in patients who required supplemental oxygen, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, those with negative predischarge fecal RT-PCR results, and those with lymphopenia at presentation. 76 A study in Beijing has shown that, 6 years after SARS-CoV infection, specific IgG Ab to SARS-CoV eventually disappeared and peripheral memory B-cell responses became undetectable in recovered patients with SARS but specific T-cell anamnestic responses could be maintained for at least 6 years. 77 Absolute lymphopenia (lymphocyte count <1.0 \u00c2 10 9 /L) was observed in 98% of cases of SARS-CoV infection, whereas low CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts on hospitalization were associated with adverse clinical outcomes. 78 Liver dysfunction with abnormal alanine transaminases was noted in 29.6% of patients on presentation, but increased to 75.9% of those receiving systemic corticosteroid and ribavirin for treatment of SARS-CoV infection. 79 ",

Other beneficial effects included a reduction in methylprednisolone use and less nosocomial infections. 84 However, the subgroup that had received lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy fared no better than the matched cohort, and received a higher mean dose of methylprednisolone. 86 The improved clinical outcome in patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir as part of the initial therapy is supported by the observations that both peak (9.6 mg/mL) and trough (5.5 mg/mL) serum concentrations of lopinavir could inhibit the virus.",

In the event of a late detection of a nosocomial outbreak, hospital closure is required to contain onward disease transmission. However, outbreaks that are detected early Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and limited to few patients, may be managed by isolating the infected patients in place or, alternatively, relocating the affected patients to a designated location. Early case detection followed by isolation should ideally be performed in negative pressure isolation rooms if available. Implementing droplet precautions and contact precautions seemed adequate to reduce the risk of infection after general exposure to patients with mild SARS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions (hand hygiene, gown, gloves, N95 masks, and eye protection) should be implemented if aerosol-generating procedures are to be undertaken. 100 ",

SARS posed a major challenge for global public health services because of its sudden appearance, rapid spread, and disappearance. The knowledge and lessons learnt from SARS-CoV epidemiology, mode of transmission, clinical course, complications, clinical management, predictors of poor outcome, and infection control have been invaluable. Although no major outbreaks have occurred since the last reported SARS cases involving laboratory personnel in Singapore and Taiwan, and 4 residents in Guangdong, an epidemic is possible at any time. Whether SARS will reappear and cause another pandemic remains unknown. The appearance of MERS-CoV in 2012 as another highly pathogenic zoonotic CoV which continues to circulate in the Middle East is a reminder to physicians and public health authorities that the threat of CoV outbreaks is ever present.",
