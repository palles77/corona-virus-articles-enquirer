The first 8 patients tested positive for antibodies against St Louis encephalitis (SLE), a mosquito-borne illness, and mosquito-control measures were instituted. Concurrently, an unusual number of deaths were noted in birds, primarily crows, and in some exotic captive bird species in the Bronx Zoo in New York City. Since SLE does not cause deaths in birds, the human and bird illnesses were thought to be unrelated. Autopsies performed on captive birds that died in the Bronx Zoo revealed varying degrees of meningoencephalitis and severe myocarditis. Tissue specimens were negative for common avian pathogens and the equine encephalitis viruses. However, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, isolated a virus from the birds' tissues and forwarded this to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing at the CDC and the University of California at Irvine indicated that this virus was closely related to WNV and that it was identical to virus from human brain tissue from 4 encephalitis cases in New York. On retesting, all initial serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens reactive to SLE were positive for WNV by IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with higher positive-negative ratios than to SLE. An additional 18 patient samples that were either borderline or negative for SLE were positive for antibody to WNV, confirming that WNV was indeed the cause of the illness in these patients. 6 West Nile virus was recognized in the United States for the first time in 1999, when it caused an epidemic of encephalitis and meningitis in New York City, NY. Since then, the disease has been steadily moving westward, and human cases were recognized in 39 from the blood of an infected woman in the West Nile province of what is now known as Uganda. 1 Further investigations in Egypt identified the virus in birds and animals in addition to humans. The virus was recognized as causing severe meningoencephalitis during a 1957 outbreak in nursing home residents in Israel. Subsequent outbreaks of WNV infection reported from Israel and Africa were mild and consisted of a flulike illness. In the mid 1990s more frequent and more severe outbreaks were reported from Romania, 2 Russia, 3, 4 and Israel, 5 and meningoencephalitis in humans was again a prominent feature. The WNV first appeared in the United States in August 1999 and since then has spread nationwide.",

All flaviviruses are closely related antigenically, which accounts for the serologic cross-reactions observed. Members of the JE complex are even more closely related; often, specialized tests are needed to differentiate the infecting flavivirus. The WNV is a spherical particle that is approximately 50 nm in diameter. It is an enveloped singlestranded RNA virus. The viral membrane has 2 integral glycoproteins-E (viral envelope) and M (membrane). The E-glycoprotein, the viral hemagglutinin, mediates virushost cell binding. It elicits most of the virus-neutralizing antibodies. 10, 11 Genetic analysis indicates that the virus responsible for the 1999 outbreak was extremely similar (99.8% homology) to the WNV isolated from a dead goose in Israel in 1998. 12 This suggests that the virus probably originated in the Middle East. It is unclear how the virus arrived in the United States. The most likely explanations are that it was carried by infected migrating birds or possibly by infected adult mosquitoes or larvae inadvertently transported on an airplane. Because humans have extremely low-level viremias, an infected international traveler is unlikely to have been the source.",

In addition, public health departments and blood banks will cooperate to identify blood products from donors who develop a West Nile viral illness after giving blood. Prompt reporting of these cases will help facilitate withdrawal of potentially infected blood components.

The newborn had little outdoor or other exposure to mosquitoes, suggesting that the infection most likely came from the mother through breast-feeding. 19 Because the benefits of breast-feeding are well established and the risk of transmission of WNV via breastfeeding remains to be quantified, this report should not influence an individual decision to breast-feed. Between 1999 and 2002, WNV infection has been reported in only 4 infants, 3 of whom were breast-fed.

When WNV transmission is occurring in an area, pregnant women who have an illness that is clinically consistent with acute WNV infection should undergo appropriate diagnostic testing. Screening of asymptomatic pregnant women or newborns for evidence of WNV infection is not recommended because no specific treatment for this infection is available, WNV-IgM antibody might persist for more than a year, and tests of a single serum sample cannot accurately determine the timing of infection.

Overall, DEET has a good safety profile and is safe to use in infants older than 2 months and in pregnant women. 46 Currently available non-DEET repellents do not provide satisfactory or reliable protection against mosquitoes.",

Most infections are mild, with symptoms primarily being fever, headache, and myalgias. People older than 50 years are at highest risk of severe disease, which may include encephalomyelitis.

The transmission season was long, with cases occurring into December in some parts of the United States. Currently, there is no specific drug treatment or vaccine against the infection, and avoiding mosquito bites is the best way to protect against the disease.

As of August 11, 2003, the CDC has received reports of a total of 182 human cases of WNV infection from 17 states with 5 reported deaths. At the same time in 2002, 112 human cases from 4 states had been reported. In 2002 the vast majority of cases occurred after the first week of August, and if the same pattern holds true in 2003, an even larger outbreak is expected this year.
