The development of airflow dynamics of human exhalation was characterized using nonhazardous schlieren photography technique, providing a visualization and quantification of turbulent exhaled airflow from 18 healthy human subjects whilst standing and lying. The flow shape of each breathing pattern was characterized by two angles and averaged values of 18 subjects. Two exhaled air velocities, u m and u p , were measured and compared. The mean peak centerline velocity, u m was found to decay correspondingly with increasing horizontal distance x in a form of power function. The mean propagation velocity, u p was found to correlate with physiological parameters of human subjects. This was always lower than u m at the mouth/nose opening, due to a vortex like airflow in front of a single exhalation cycle. When examining the talking and breathing process between two persons, the potential infectious risk was found to depend on their breathing patterns and spatial distribution of their exhaled air. Our study when combined with information on generation and distributions of pathogens could provide a prediction method and control strategy to minimize infection risk between persons in indoor environments.",

To control and reduce the contamination risk of these infectious aerosols, many studies have been focusing on characterizing the dynamics of exhaled airflow and behaviors of aerosol containing droplets in indoor environments [5e40] . These studies on exhaled airflow behaviors are the first step to understand the potential of airborne transmission and could provide a way to predict and control disease infection. In previous studies, detailed information on exhaled airflow dispersion as an indicator of potential airborne disease transmission have been investigated using three types of objects: human volunteers [11e18], breathing thermal manikins [19e27] and computer simulated persons (CSPs) [28e40] . Although studies based on breathing behaviors of manikins or CSPs can provide relatively comprehensive prediction of airflow patterns and infection prone zones, there could be errors with the use of these two techniques for prediction of real breathing conditions without a proper understanding of breathing characteristics of actual human subjects [13, 16] .",

            "text": "There has been little information on airflow dynamics of human exhalation. Chen and Zhao [37] reported that the initial exhaled velocity could greatly influence the dispersion of droplets in the range of 0.1 mme200 mm in terms of trajectories and distances. To predict the evaporation, dispersion and transportation of respiratory droplets in indoor environment using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), boundary conditions such as expelled airflow velocity are necessary [14] . Different techniques have been used to estimate exhaled velocities during different expiration behaviors such as coughing, sneezing and breathing. Various results have been reported with different methods of study, providing little data in previous literature. Some studies [30, 37] used approximate values of exhaled velocities produced during different respiratory activities (e.g. normal breathing 1 m/s, talking 5 m/s, coughing 10 m/s, and sneezing 20e50 m/s). Chao et al. [12] applied the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique for measuring expelled velocities during coughing (11.7 m/s) and speaking (3.9 m/s). Tang et al. [16] used schlieren imaging technology to determine the maximum nasal and mouth breathing velocities of 1.4 m/s and 1.3 m/s, respectively. The maximum expiration air velocities for coughing and sneezing was found to be 4e5 m/s. Gupta et al. [13] developed a source modelling of air flow rate, flow direction and area of mouth/nose opening using human subjects for boundary settings for CFD simulations. Xu et al. [17] pointed out that even though the boundary settings complied with real human breathing characteristics, there could still be differences in the exhaled airflow of a complicated manikin than real persons. Similar problems could also occur in CSPs. The preclusion of using hazardous lasers, toxic tracer gases or particles on human subjects, which can otherwise be applied to the manikins, has so far limited research investigations and very little information on real breathing airflow has been provided. One method of studying real human exhaled airflow without the aid of hazardous techniques or materials is the use of schlieren photography [2, 15, 16] .",

Some other methods have been used in previous studies to achieve similar purpose, like the particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) [12, 14] and using smoker subjects to visualize their breaths [13] . Schlieren imaging relies only on density differences to refract the light beam to visualize an airflow [44] . Human exhaled flow differs from the surrounding air in density, especially when air is immediately expelled from the mouth or nose [17, 45] . No invasive or potentially irritant tracers are needed, so human volunteers are quite safe [2, 15, 16] . The implementation of schlieren imaging technique on human volunteers can further enhance our understanding of the behavior of real human respiration and the potential contamination risk of these breathing activities. The accuracy for the prediction of the transmission behavior could be further improved by using other additional techniques, such as CFD or breathing manikins, to provide a powerful tool for evaluating the infection risk of respiratory pathogens.",

These subjects were instructed to breathe naturally for a relatively long time (above 10 min) with each breathing pattern. However, these subjects constantly complained about their dry mouth due to saliva evaporation during their mouth only breathing with a nose clip restricting breathing from their nose. Interruption by shutting up their lips and saliva swallowing were permitted as a part of their breathing pattern. The camera recorded each breathing process for about 2 min without the subject realizing the beginning of the recording. When a subject was instructed to inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth; the air from his or her lung was actually expelled from the nose and mouth simultaneously (see Appendix A), as the nasal and oral cavities are connected and air leaks into these cavities even when a person is not intended to exhale with his/her nose.",

The rising thermal plume can be inferred to contribute to the inhaled air to a large extent for a standing person.

For mouth only breathing, most measurements were found with a downward flow trend with an averaged q 1 of about 14 , even though in most conditions of the airflow in the mouth breathing was considered horizontal [12e14,19e24,28e35]. This might be due to the longitudinal asymmetry of the mouth cavity structure.",

Fig. 5 shows the repeated breaths of one male subject with a breathing frequency of about 10 min \u00c01 and variations of amplitudes of exhaled velocities over time. The peak value of each breath was extracted and then averaged for the definition of the mean peak velocity, u m . The ratio, u m '/u m , of the standard deviation of amplitudes to the mean value was used to indicate the fluctuation degree of a person's breathing [17] . In this work, the u 0.03 '/u 0.03 was at x \u00bc 0.03 m with a variation of merely 9% to about 160%, meaning that some people was breathing regularly and some did not. The irregularity of the breathing could further increase the turbulence degree of the exhaled air. This u 0.03 should be lower than the real initial velocity that was obtained from the immediate mouth/nose opening; as there could be velocity decay with increasing distance from the origin when the measured point did not fall within the constant velocity core [17] .",

The physiological parameters of a person: exhaled minute volume (MV, the volume of exhaled air from a person's lungs per minute), breathing frequency (BF) and mouth/nose shape and area could contribute to the variation; and these could be different from person to person. In spite of smaller MV, the initial velocities of female subjects were shown to be higher than those of male subjects mainly due to higher RF and smaller mouth/nose opening [13, 17] . The air leakages from the nose could result in relatively lower mean initial velocity from the mouth when people inhale with their nose and exhaled with their mouth as shown in Table 3 . Human postures could also affect the breathing by influencing the activity of abdominal muscle [13] , but no significant relationship between postures and breathing velocities was found in our present study.",

The main reason of the deviation lies in different methods used to evaluate the exhaled velocity. Our study employed the mean peak velocity as depicted in Fig. 5 , while Tang et al. [16] used the visible propagation distance divided by the propagation time as shown in Fig. 4 . The latter method describes the propagation speed of the exhalation flow measured at the leading front edge of the flow within certain time interval rather than the initial pulsating flow generated by a person. This could also be the reason why velocities of sneezing and coughing reported by Tang et al. (4e5 m/s) [16] are significantly lower than the generally recognized velocities of sneezing and coughing (e.g. sneezing 20e50 m/s, coughing 10 m/s) [18] . The maximum propagation velocity obtained by quantification given by schlieren images should not be considered as the exhaled velocity as this might cause underestimation for boundary setting of CFD simulation. The propagation velocity of the exhaled airflow will be further discussed in Section 3.2.3.",

Although Tang et al. [16] reported the observed maximum propagation distance of mouth only breathing and nose only breathing was 0.8 m and 0.6 m, respectively; it is still difficult to know exactly where the exhaled airflow should stop; if it stops, it must be dependent on the surrounding turbulence level of the airflow in the room.",

From Fig. 7 , u p for our male subjects and female subjects in standing posture and with mouth only breathing, varied from 0.2 m/s to 0.6 m/s and from 0.3 m/s to 0.8 m/s, respectively, which is significantly lower than the u m measured near the mouth opening (about 0.03 m). Even for the maximum u p derived close to the mouth/nose opening [16] , u p was still lower than the mean peak velocity u 0.03 listed in Table 3 . Fig. 8 shows that the front of a single exhalation cycle was similar to a vortex like airflow or to a puff. The peak exhaled air velocity u m in a point close to the mouth was measured when the vortex airflow passed this point, and this was typically larger than the propagation velocity of the same vortex. This would be the typical situation for a vortex as illustrated by Akhmetov [55] .",

Fig. 9 shows that the u p would be increased with an increase in BSA \u00c2 BF for both genders. Fig. 9 also shows that the u p was basically linear in relation to the BSA \u00c2 BF. A linear regression equation was assumed as given by Equation (2) . Table 4 gives the regression analysis results of the slope k, the correlation coefficient r and the ttest for r. The r for all test groups was found to be more than 0.7 for a p < 0.05, which shows that the u p is linearly related to the BSA \u00c2 BF. However, due to the small number of points, the equation should be further validated by more measurements.",

Air flows expelled from both nose and mouth during talking were observed and flow directions from the mouth varied due to the content of the conversation. Most of the time, expiration airflows from opposite subjects would remain separate and were brought up by a constantly rising thermal plume around their bodies (with a thickness of approximate 10 cm), although occasionally the flow was shown to interact with the receptor's thermal plume layer and interfered with the breathing zone. Mouth breathing (nose in and mouth out) was shown to have a higher potential to transmit diseases to receptor subject as the flow generated by mouth breathing could spread over a longer distance as compared with talking and are more horizontally directed than nose breathing.",

The spreading angles of the exhaled plume was shown to have minimal variations between human subjects. The q 1 and q 2 of mouth and nasal breathing measured from side view were consistent in different postures with little variation. The measured mean angles obtained in our study could be used to describe the average level of the physical geometry of human breathing. C The u p and u m could be used to describe the breathing velocity from different aspects. The u p would be significantly lower than the measured initial velocity u 0.03 . However, u p would not be useful as velocity boundary condition for CFD settings as it could cause underestimation of the exhaled velocity. The u m would decay with increasing horizontal distance along the centerline and the decay could be predicted by a power function. The mean u p within the observed region was found to be correlated to human physiological parameters. Although the maximum propagation distance of exhaled airflow by measuring u m or u p would be difficult to determine, as the exhaled airflow over 0.4 m would interact with turbulent room air. We suggest more measurements with human subjects to validate the prediction method for the u m and u p . C The interaction of exhaled airflows with opposite (facing) subjects could vary between subjects and breathing patterns, implying possible complexity in prediction of infectious risk exposure of human occupants in close proximity in room air. The information on spatial distribution of airborne pathogens in the microenvironment between two persons is particularly important for identifying and implementing infection control strategies.",
