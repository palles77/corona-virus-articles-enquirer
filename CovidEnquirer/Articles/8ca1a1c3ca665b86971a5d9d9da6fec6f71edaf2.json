Initial genomic studies of the H1N1 virus were reported sensationally and in isolation without being put in the context of the larger body of research to which they contributed. Worst-case scenarios for the H1N1 pandemic were sometimes laid out theatrically without caveating possible risks with any sense of What is new?",

When high quality, specific information was available, the journalistic imperative of balanced coverage too often resulted in trustworthy evidence from credible scientists reported alongside ill-informed opinions from the most popular celebrities and conflicted lobbyists [10] . Similar concerns were raised following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 [11, 12] . Likewise, the 2014 Ebola outbreak was consistently front-page news around the world for weeksd drawing unprecedented public interest (see Fig. 1 )ddespite only a single Ebola death outside of West Africa [13] . To researchers, this ''research-to-reporting gap'' and the broader ''research-to-action gap'' that it perpetuates is frustrating. But to those people who rely on the media as a primary source of health informationdthe health professionals who provide treatment, the policymakers who direct government action, and the public who make personal health decisions every daydthis gap is potentially harmful. It means people may be routinely left to act on suboptimal information and unnecessary fear, and therefore cannot make informed decisions about how to respond to pandemics.",

Analyses confirmed that news media coverage of pandemics is not perfect, especially its scientific quality if not also its sensationalism. Slight improvements were observed between the SARS and H1N1 pandemics. Possible explanations for this improvement include the media learning from experience with the first pandemic and/or better crisis communications from public health authorities throughout the second pandemic. It could also be a reaction to the 2005 revision of the International Health Regulations [43\u00c045].",

            "text": "This study has several strengths compared to previous work in news media analysis on which it builds. First, it drew from over 15,000 sources of news records, making results more generalizable across a broader range of contexts. Second, it used pilot tests to optimize searches for maximal sensitivity. Third, it drew on existing toolsdan empirically validated index and rich pragma-linguistic frameworkd when developing new metrics for quantitatively measuring news records' scientific quality and sensationalism. Fourth, the study assessed 10,000 randomly sampled news records from a massive corpus of 163,433 records (instead of just a small sample feasible for human scoring) using recent advances in machine-learning methods and computing power. This means that population-wide estimates incorporate more information from more sources and that detailed subgroup analyses are theoretically possible given most-likely scores are available at the individual record level. Fifth, the study incorporated a relevance screening into the modeling procedures to boost specificity. Sixth, there were multiple RAs scoring the training and test set records to reduce human errors and biases. Seventh, the study validated the approach and measured its reliability and accuracy. Overall, the study showed that automated methods can quantify characteristics of news records faster (i.e., within seconds), cheaper (i.e., fewer human resources), and possibly better than humans (i.e., avoiding silly mistakes and rater drift). The specific procedure implemented in this study can at the very least identify subsets of news records that are far more likely to have particular scientific and discursive qualities.",

            "text": "This study also has several limitations. First, it has all the usual pitfalls of automated text classification, including its many assumptions and simplifications [12] . Second, its maximum entropy model leaves information on the table by relying on a multinomial regression that treats the scientific quality and sensationalism scores as nominal rather than ordinal data. Third, it required a substantial initial investment of human resources to score the training and test sets. Fourth, the final model was not perfectly accurate with classification errors compounded across two applications. Fifth, the performance of this particular machine-learning approach was not compared to others.",

This could include, for example, constructing day-by-day time series of these characteristics that could be stratified to compare countries, rank news media organizations, or even judge individual journalists (see Figs. 7 and 8) . Publishing rankings comparing news media organizations or journalists could encourage them to compete on quality and enhance their reporting practices. These data could also help find factors broadly associated with better news coverage (e.g., record length, readership, political affiliation) or predictive of rapid changes in scientific quality and sensationalism (e.g., new event, major announcement, public scolding of news media). Record-level data can also be used for rigorous impact evaluations such as quasi-experimental interrupted time-series analyses of interventions aimed at improving news media coverage. The feasibility of real-time analysis of news media coverage on emerging pandemics should also be explored.",
