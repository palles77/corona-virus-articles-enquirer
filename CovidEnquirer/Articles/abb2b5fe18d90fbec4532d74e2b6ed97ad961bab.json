            "text": "Viral pneumonia is one of the most common maladies affecting infants and children throughout the world. The World Health Organization and UNICEF report that acute respiratory infection continues to be a leading cause of mortality in young children; in 2000 it killed approximately 2 million children under the age of 5 in developing countries. 1 About 40% of these cases are due to viral infections. Pneumonia, a respiratory disease characterized by inflammation of the lung parenchyma, is usually caused by viruses, bacteria, or irritants. The term pneumonia refers to infection of the lung parenchyma and excludes the tissues of the airway such as the bronchi. However, acute viral lower respiratory tract infections in children are thought to affect all of the epithelial cells lining the airway, from the nasopharynx to the alveolar bed. Therefore, viral pneumonia is often a component of a more generalized respiratory tract infection syndrome.",

However, studies conducted during the last several decades have struggled to define precise quantitative models for the incidence of these diseases. Most large studies have been conducted in hospitals and thus lacked a known denominator of patients at risk. These studies also vary by differences in geographic location of the study, type of hospital, age of the patients, season, criteria for admission, severity of disease, and number and type of diagnostic tests performed. The relatively new use of molecular diagnostic tests has increased our ability to diagnose virus infection, but comparison of data from these studies with data from cell culture-based studies is problematic.",

Viral culture and polymerase chain reaction identification of viruses from nasal and throat samples were obtained from all surveillance children, providing population-based rates of hospitalization for RSV, influenza virus, and PIV, as well as demographic, clinical, and risk factor assessment for each virus. Of the 592 enrolled children, RSV was identified in 20%, influenza in 3%, PIV in 7%, other respiratory viruses in 36%, and no detectable virus in 39%. Population-based rates of acute respiratory illness hospitalizations in children younger than 5 years were 18 per 1000. Virus-positive hospitalization rates per 1000 children were 3.5 for RSV, 1.2 for PIV, and 0.6 for influenza virus.

The cause of viral pneumonia varies depending on the age of the child, the setting in which the virus was acquired, the season, and the presence of medical or environmental risk factors. Although a very long list of viruses has been reported to cause pneumonia, the astute clinician can narrow the cause to a short list of potential agents using a careful medical history and physical examination. Viruses are infrequently the cause of this presentation, and pneumonia often is only part of a more generalized presentation of a systemic disease. Rubella and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection associated with systemic disease in the mother can be associated with severe congenital or neonatal disease that probably is acquired by the transplacental route, presumably through the hematogenous spread of virus. Pneumonia manifests with signs of respiratory distress such as retractions, grunting, tachypnea, and cyanosis, sometimes requiring immediate resuscitation and mechanical ventilation because of depressed respiration. Neonatal viral pneumonia can present with more nonspecific systemic signs of illness, such as apnea, bradycardia, poor peripheral perfusion, or temperature instability. These signs are also frequently found in bacterial pneumonia in the neonatal period. Usually, infants with congenital CMV or rubella pneumonia have additional signs of congenital infection, such as petechiae, hepatosplenomegaly, and low birth weight. CMV infection can be detected by testing of the urine of the infant in shell vial or traditional cell culture.",

Systemic HSV infection should be treated with a prolonged course of intravenous acyclovir. Enteroviruses commonly cause symptomatic or asymptomatic infections of the gastrointestinal tract during the summer and fall.

            "text": "A large panel of respiratory viruses is capable of causing pneumonia during childhood. RSV; human metapneumovirus (hMPV); PIV types 1, 2, and 3; influenza virus types A and B; and adenoviruses make up the majority of cases. RSV is still the most frequent cause of severe respiratory infections in infants after the first weeks of life and in young children, and it is responsible for 75,000 to 125,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States. 4, 5 The role of rhinoviruses in causing lower respiratory tract illness such as pneumonia is under much discussion. Rhinovirus infection in children is so common that evidence for rhinovirus infection can be found frequently in children without symptoms of disease. Therefore, attributing causality to rhinovirus in cases of pneumonia is more difficult than with other viruses. Nevertheless, rhinovirus is present significantly more often in cases of childhood pneumonia, and some experts believe rhinovirus is the most common etiology of all types of lower respiratory tract illness in children. PIVs, commonly associated with laryngotracheitis, also cause pneumonia but in less discrete epidemics than those caused by RSV. The immunocompromised are a special population at elevated risk for these infections, especially for CMV. The major features of the epidemiology of respiratory virus pneumonia caused by common agents was determined in the United States in detail mostly during the 1960s through the 1980s in a series of seminal longitudinal studies, such as the D.C. Children's Hospital studies, [8] [9] [10] [11] Chapel Hill Pediatrics surveillance study, 12 the Vanderbilt Vaccine clinic surveillance studies, 13, 14 the Tecumseh study of respiratory illness (Tecumseh, Michigan), and the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study. The principal viruses identified in association with pneumonia in otherwise healthy infants and children were RSV, PIV, and influenza viruses. These studies used cell culture-based or serologic detection for the most part, and it is fair to say that most of these studies did not have optimal culture systems for rhinoviruses or coronaviruses. More recently, very large studies using database methods, such as the U.S. National Hospital Discharge Survey data system 15, 16 or the Tennessee Medicaid Database 17 (\u223c1% of U.S. children) have confirmed the earlier findings with larger numbers and added detail about the risk factors for severe disease. In the last several years, new data have emerged on the role of a newly identified paramyxovirus, hMPV, 18 which was shown to be one of the most common causes associated with lower respiratory tract infection in children. 19 Before 2001, studies could not address the epidemiology of this virus because it had not been discovered.",

Alveolar walls thicken, and the alveolar space becomes occluded with exudates, sloughed cells, and activated macrophages. The clinical disease is distinguished by poor air exchange, first noted by poor oxygen intake (as detected by pulse oximetry or blood gas measurement) followed by CO 2 retention. The physiology of the disease reflects an inflammatory process resulting in an alveolar-capillary block that interferes with gas exchange, resulting in elevation of the alveolar-arterial PO 2 difference. Many cases of viral pneumonia in young children are also accompanied by inflammation of the bronchioles, and air trapping contributes to the poor level of gas exchange. Children compensate for respiratory compromise better than do adults, generally by increasing the respiratory rate. Children show a remarkable resilience when faced with respiratory compromise, even though their airways exhibit a much higher intrinsic level of resistance. Unrelieved tachypnea, however, can lead to exhaustion and respiratory failure.

It is thought that the initial infection occurs in the nasopharynx after inoculation with contaminated respiratory secretions (fomite transmission) or exposure to large-particle aerosols containing virus. The viruses that cause pneumonia all have surface fusion proteins that mediate both virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion in monolayer cell culture. The viruses cause cytopathic effects following infection by inducing necrosis or apoptosis of infected cells. The viral fusion peptides of these viruses cause multinucleated cell (syncytium) formation in cell monolayer cultures. It is presumed that they cause syncytium formation in vivo, but the direct evidence for this is scarce. In fact, viruses that cause syncytium in nonpolarized cultured cells (i.e., cells that do not form tight junctions and segregate apical and basolateral plasma membrane regions) often do not cause syncytia in polarized cell lines or primary cells in culture. Most of these viruses appear to infect both ciliated and nonciliated cells in culture. Impaired mucociliary clearance caused by infection of ciliated cells probably contributes to progression to pneumonia. Whether these viruses infect type I or II pneumocytes more efficiently is not known. Some of the respiratory viruses cause an abortive round of infection in cultured macrophages.

Upon various cellular stimulations usually related to stress or pathogens, the inhibitors are degraded and the nuclear factors \u03baB translocate to the nucleus where they bind to \u03baB DNA elements to induce transcription of a large number of genes, especially those associated with immune responses. Nuclear factor-interleukin 6 (NF-IL-6) regulates expression of cytokine and adhesion molecule genes without increased transcription. RSV infection induces increased expression of several cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8, which are transcriptionally regulated by NF-\u03baB and NF-IL-6. These cytokine-regulated pathways appear to contribute to airway inflammation during pneumonia.",

The epithelial cells appear to initiate a cascade of events that represent components of the innate immune response. When epithelial cells secrete IL-6 and IL-8 and other soluble factors, they recruit and initiate activation of immune effectors. The chemokine RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) is a chemoattractant for eosinophils, monocytes, T cells, and basophils that is secreted in response to viruses such as RSV. Eventually, adaptive immune effectors such as CD8 + T cells attack the virus-infected cells to eliminate the infection. This immune cytolysis is important to disease resolution but comes at the price of inducing some level of immunopathology.

Vital signs reveal fever in about half of cases at presentation; fever higher than 103\u00b0F is much less common than in bacterial pneumonia but can occur. Systemic toxicity is less common than with bacterial infection, because respiratory viruses (other than measles virus) rarely cause viremia. Of the conventional respiratory viruses, influenza virus is the one that most frequently causes high fever and toxic appearance. Respiratory failure, heralded by a change in alertness due to hypoxia and CO 2 retention or decreased respiratory effort due to exhaustion, requires immediate action. Physical examination reveals crackles on auscultation, generally more prominent on inspiration. RSV disease in infants is commonly a mixed presentation of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in which case expiratory wheezing is present in addition to inspiratory crackles. The viruses that cause pneumonia also cause upper respiratory tract infection. Therefore, concomitant coryza is common, complicated in about a third of cases with otitis media. Nasal obstruction caused by purulent nasal secretions contributes to the respiratory distress, especially in infants.

Children who have an effusion or an empyema identified on chest radiograph may need a computed tomography scan to further define the scope of the problem, but these complications are rare in viral pneumonia. The radiologic findings on chest radiographs of viral pneumonia are similar to those of bronchiolitis and reactive airways disease. The usual findings on chest radiographs are hyperaeration, prominent lung markings due to bronchial wall thickening, and focal areas of atelectasis ( Fig. 26-1) . The hili may be somewhat prominent, but major hilar adenopathy is uncommon. The findings are commonly thought to differ from the typical case of bacterial pneumonia, which usually has been thought to present as lobar consolidation. It is true that most children with focal alveolar pneumonia have laboratory evidence of a bacterial infection, especially those with lobar infiltrates. However, half of the children with solely interstitial infiltrates on the chest radiograph had evidence of bacterial infection in some studies. 23 Therefore, radiologic presentation of interstitial infiltrates alone does not distinguish between bacterial and viral pneumonia. One also cannot differentiate viral pneumonia from bronchiolitis or reactive airways disease on the basis of radiologic findings alone. Differentiation is based on nonradiologic factors such as the age of the patient and the clinical history. The chest radiograph in newborns with viral pneumonia usually shows bilateral diffuse densities or may have a granular appearance, similar to that found in hyaline membrane disease. When infection is congenital, radiographic changes may be present at birth, whereas the radiographs of infants infected during birth may be normal initially but can rapidly progress during the first day of life.",

Culture of virus in cell monolayer cultures is considered the gold standard. Viruses are identified by characteristic cytopathic effect and confirmed by immunodetection using virus-specific antibodies and fluorescence detection. Culture techniques require a high level of expertise and generally are best performed on fresh specimens, such as secretions obtained by nasopharyngeal aspiration or nasopharyngeal swab. Rapid diagnostic tests for RSV and influenza A and B based on the immunodetection of viral proteins in nasopharyngeal secretions are widely used, but their positive predictive value is most appropriate for use during epidemics when the prevalence of positive tests is expected to be high. Antigen detection tests are not sensitive enough to determine that a hospitalized patient is no longer shedding infectious virus; therefore, negative tests should not be used to justify termination of contact precautions in a patient with viral pneumonia. Increasingly, clinical detection of viruses is being performed by molecular genetic techniques, such as reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization or sequence analysis. This technique identifies the presence of viral nucleic acid. Polymerase chain reaction tests tend to be more sensitive than cell culture during the period of viral clearance (1-3 weeks after infection). It is not clear how long viral RNAs are present following active infections, but evidence to date shows that they may persist for weeks or months even when virus can no longer be cultured. Therefore, a positive polymerase chain reaction-based test must be used with caution, because in some cases it is possible that a positive test obtained during an acute pneumonia is actually related to a recent infection. Serology is helpful to diagnose or confirm infection, particularly in the clinical research setting. A fourfold rise in serum antibodies against a virus between the preinfection period and after infection, particularly when a serology testing functional antibodies is used, suggests a specific diagnosis. In practice, the use of serologic tests to diagnose the cause of pneumonia is difficult because the rise in antibodies in young children may not achieve a significant level until 6 to 8 weeks or more have passed. evidence for the presence of two viruses in about 5% to 10% of cases of viral lower respiratory tract infection. There is little direct evidence in immunocompetent individuals that coinfection is characterized by a more severe clinical course than infection with a single agent. Bacterial superinfection does occur, but overt bacterial lung disease during viral pneumonia is unusual. Bacterial complication of viral pneumonia is suggested by an abrupt change in symptoms over several hours with appearance of generalized toxicity, and possibly with new radiographic findings of parenchymal consolidation or pleural effusions. Marked and changed leukocytosis (e.g., >20,000 cells/mm 3 white blood cells in the peripheral blood) is suggestive of a bacterial process, but not particularly sensitive or specific. Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacteria involved in complication of viral pneumonia, and influenza virus pneumonia is the most common viral pneumonia to be complicated by bacterial infection. Recent vaccine studies with a pneumococcal vaccine in a large population of children showed that a nine-valent bacterial polysaccharide vaccine prevented about a third of cases of viral pneumonia, suggesting frequent interactions of bacteria and viruses that are not apparent by current methods of clinical evaluation. 34 ",

Oxygen is required if there is grunting, flaring, severe tachypnea, and retractions, or if pulse oximetry indicates oxygen saturation below 90% to 92%, or arterial blood gas measurement indicates depressed PO 2 (<60-70 mm Hg). Retention of CO 2 is particularly concerning, especially in the face of tachypnea. Severe respiratory distress, hypoxia, and dehydration are among the indications for hospitalization. Care in the hospital is principally supportive, such as the delivery of supplemental oxygen and intravenous fluids, and the use of mechanical ventilation in the case of respiratory failure. The youngest infants with RSV pneumonia may require monitoring for the risk of apnea, although apnea usually presents near the beginning of the illness. Chest physiotherapy and mucolytics may be of value, but their efficacy is uncertain in viral pneumonia. If a specific viral diagnosis is made early in the course of illness, there are some antiviral medications available. Licensed drugs for influenza infection include the M2 ion-channel inhibitors amantidine and rimantidine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. These antiviral compounds work best when therapy is initiated in the first days of infection and are particularly relevant for those with immunosuppression or preexisting cardiopulmonary disease. Ribavirin delivered as an aerosol is licensed for treatment of severe RSV infection, but recent studies have questioned its value. Most centers do not routinely treat otherwise healthy infants with RSV pneumonia with ribavirin. RSV intravenous immune globulin and palivizumab, an intramuscular injectable humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the RSV fusion protein, are available for prophylaxis against RSV disease and are indicated for children with chronic cardiopulmonary disease and other serious risk factors. Clinical trials of therapy of acute disease using these antibody preparations, however, have not shown this treatment to be effective during hospitalization. Antibiotic therapy does not improve the outcome in viral pneumonia and has not been shown to alter the risk of bacterial complication of viral pneumonia as a superinfection. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the setting of viral infection causes the selection of antibioticresistant bacteria. If secondary infection does occur, usually in hospitalized patients in intensive care units, the selected infecting bacterium may not be susceptible to conventional antibiotics. Therefore, specific diagnosis of the etiology of severe pneumonia suspected to be of viral etiology is warranted even when an antiviral therapeutic option is not anticipated, so as to minimize inappropriate antibiotic exposure.",

Complications during influenza pneumonia in children range from acute otitis media, sinusitis, and bacterial tracheitis to rare episodes of encephalitis, myositis, myocarditis, febrile seizures, encephalopathy, or Reyes syndrome. RSV disease is commonly complicated by otitis media. Immunocompromised children, those with underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and neonates are at the highest risk for severe sequelae.

The role in humans of cell-mediated immune effectors in protection against disease on reinfection or during virus challenge following immunization is less clear, however. Macrophages are abundant in the alveolar spaces of the lung. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that the resident pulmonary alveolar macrophage population actively suppresses the antigen-presenting function of lung dendritic cells (DCs) in situ. Low numbers of DCs and high numbers of macrophages have been noted in the human alveolar compartment, suggesting that the alveolar compartment may be less efficient for mounting an immune response. Human alveolar macrophages recovered during RSV infection can yield small amounts of RSV, but replication of RSV in alveolar macrophages is restricted.

Thorough hand washing, the use of contact isolation, and patient or provider cohorting are critical to the prevention of the nosocomial spread of infection to high-risk individuals in the hospital. Vaccination of at-risk individuals with licensed vaccines for influenza virus (using trivalent H1N1/H3N2/B subunit or trivalent live attenuated virus vaccines) is wise. Amantidine or rimantidine can be used effectively as a prophylactic treatment in some for the prevention of symptomatic influenza disease during an epidemic or immediately following exposure. Polyclonal (RSV intravenous immune globulin) or monoclonal (palivizumab, IM) antibody prophylactic treatments can be used in infants at high risk of RSV disease, and these treatments prevent half or more of RSV hospitalizations during treatment.

Both subunit and live attenuated RSV vaccines have been tested in phase I or II trials, and the live attenuated vaccines appear promising. The challenge for investigators is to identify or generate attenuated viruses that are sufficiently immunogenic to induce a protective response in newborns without causing any signs or symptoms of respiratory disease. Coldpassaged or bovine strain PIV type 3 vaccines have been tested extensively in humans and appear promising. HMPV vaccine candidates have been generated but have not been tested in clinical trials to date.",

B, By 1 week of life, mechanical ventilation is discontinued, and the lung fields normalize. C, At 6 weeks of life, the child presented with RSV-positive test and respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation; radiograph shows diffuse interstitial infiltrates and atelectasis or pneumonia of the right upper lobe. D, By 7 weeks of life, the child remained on a mechanical ventilator, but infiltrates and atelectasis were improving.
