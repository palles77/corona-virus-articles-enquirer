In contrast, late genes appear to lack an untranslated leader as well as termination signals at their 3' ends, which results in readthrough by RNA polymerase. Furthermore, early termination signals are not recognized in the late phaseof infection (Smith et al., 1984) . Basic promoter sequence elements such as a TATA box or CAAT sequence are not present in vaccinia promoters. The vaccinia early and late promoters are not recognized by prokaryotic or eukaryotic RNA polymerases (Smith et al., 1984) . Vaccinia messengers appear to have a capped 5' end consisting of a Fmethyl-guanosine (m7G) residue (Wei and Moss, 1975; Urushibara et al., 1975) and they have an A-tail at their 3' ends (Nevins and Joklik, 1975) . The regulatory signals controlling the transcription and the time of gene activation reside in very short stretches of approximately 20 to 30 bp. This has been shown by translocation of promoter fragments by means of homologous recombination (Cochran et al., 1985b; Rose1 and Moss, 1985; Hanggi et al., 1986) .",

The functional analysis of the vaccinia late promoter of the 11 kd basic polypeptide revealed that the sequences from position -29 to +8 (+l is arbitrarily defined as the A-residue of the AUG) are sufficient for transcriptional activity (Hanggi et al., 1986) . This was shown through the insertion of a chimeric gene consisting of the wild-type 11K promoter up to position +8, and the coding region of the mouse dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gene into the vaccinia thymidine kinase (t/r) gene by homologous recombination (Panicali et al., 1982; Mackett et al., 1982) . We have shown that mutations within the conserved TAAAT motif result in complete inactivation of promoter activity. We further show that mutations of sequences surrounding the TAAAT motif either have no effect or increase the overall promoter strength. The mutated regions of the translocared fragment fnclude the start codon of translation; this sequence is partially conserved as reflected in the consensus sequence TAAAT (Hanggi et al., 1986) . The AUG start codon of translation is either part of the TAAAT motif or immediately adjacent to this element. This paper concerns the study of the structure of the 5' terminus of vaccinia virus late RNA transcripts. We demonstrate that the transcripts of both wild-type and translocated promoters are discontinuously synthesized and obtain a poly(A) leader sequence. We will discuss possible mechanisms involved in the synthesis of the discontinuous late transcripts.",

In contrast, the efficiency of translation can be decreased more than lo-fold as compared to the wild-type translocated-dhfr construct. This phenomenon appears to be independent of the test gene cloned downstream of the mutated promoter (unpublished data). A detailed analysis of the different mutants will be presented elsewhere. The reduction of the translatability of these messengers indicates that the sequence at the 5' end of the mRNA might be directly or indirectly involved in a translational control mechanism. We have therefore analyzed the structure and sequence at the 5' end of late vaccinia messengers in more detail.",

The reason for this is that primer elongation experiments are complicated by a high degree of complementarity in late vaccinia RNA transcripts, both DNA strands are transcribed, genes can be overlapping, and there is readthrough of the RNA polymerase (Plucienniczak et al., 1985; Smith et al., 1984) . If, however, the mature messenger is discontinuously synthesized, Sl mapping experiments can only reveal the putative junction site and not the 5' end of the mature messenger. We have been able to avoid a high nonspecific background in primer extension experiments by end-labeling the synthetic oligonucleotide primers. The results of such primer extension experiments using different gene internal primers and RNA derived from the translocated 11K promoter-dhfr gene construct are shown in Figure 1 . If the 5' end of the RNA as determined by Sl mapping (Hgnggi et al., 1986) represents the genuine 5'end of the mature transcript, we would obtain a primer elongated cDNA migrating at the position indicated by the arrows. However, the majority of the cDNA products are extended by approximately 35 bases beyond the Sl \"start site\" independent of the position of the synthetic oligonucleotide ( Figure 1 , lanes 2-4). As a negative control, we have performed primer extension with a dhfr primer and wild-type mRNA that does not contain dhfr sequences ( Figure 1, cDNA-RNA hybrids were incubated in the presence or absence of RNAase A at a final concentration of 10 Kg/ml and the hybrids were cap-selected by immunoprecipitation using a rabbit anti-m7G antiserum as described.",

The full-length cDNA-RNA hybrids are also insensitive to digestion with a combination of the RNAases A, T1, and CL3 prior to cap selection (results not shown).

As a control we have performed Sl mapping using genomic vaccinia DNA as a probe ( Figures 6A and 68 , lane 1). The 3' ends of these genomic Sl probes consist of nonhomologous plasmid sequences. This allows the separation of the input DNA probe from the Sl fragments protected by readthrough transcripts. The digestion with nuclease Sl was performed at low temperature to minimize nibbling of the nuclease at the 5' end of the RNA. The results shown in Figures 6A and 6B (lane 2) confirm the presence of the poly(A) stretch of approximately 35 nucleotides at the 5' end of the mRNA. The Si protected fragments of 350, respectively 290, nucleotides in length, which occur after mapping with the artificial DNA probe containing the 5' A-stretch ( Figures 6A and 6B, lane 2) are mapping at the position of the Sl \"start site\" and correspond to readthrough transcripts that do not have an A-stretch at the 5' end. We observed the same percentage of transcripts initiated at the translocated 11K promoter as compared to readthrough transcripts after Sl mapping using either the genomic or the artificial Sl probes ( Figure 6A , compare the band migrating at 465 in lane 1 with the band at 350 nucleotides in lane 2). This indicates that the majority of the transcripts initiated at the translocated promoter contain the A-stretch at their 5'ends. Readthrough of the RNA polymerase is again more prominent at the t/c locus in the middle of the genome than at the location of the authentic 1lK gene in the left-hand side of the genome.

An RNA leader sequence of ap proximately 35 bases is linked to RNA transcripts originating from the 1lK translocated promoter and from the authentic 11K and 4b promoters. We have shown by cap selection using a rabbit anti-mrG antiserum that the extended transcripts represent mature mRNAs with an m7G cap structure at their 5'terminus. Treatment of the cDNA-RNA hybrids obtained after primer extension with different RNAases prior to cap selection did not remove the cap structure ( Figure 2 ). This demonstrates that we are obtaining full-length cDNA and not premature stops of the reverse transcriptase within the discontinuous leader RNA. Sequencing of the RNA transcripts and of the first strand cDNA revealed that the leader RNA consists of a homopolymeric stretch of at least 20 A-residues (Figures 4 and  5) . The presence of other bases in front of the A-stretch cannot formally be excluded on the basis of the sequencing data. It has been described that reverse transcriptase can misincorporate nucleotides after homopolymeric stretches (Murphy et al., 1966) . This phenomenon could explain the observed cleavage in all four lanes in the 5' end of the cDNA sequence ( Figure 5 ). However, Sl mapping of RNA transcripts with an artificial DNA probe containing a stretch of 80 A-residues upstream of position -1 replacing promoter sequences confirms the presence of a poly(A) stretch of approximately 35 nucleotides ( Figures  6A and 66 late transcripts is a general phenomenon.",

The data that we have presented are to some extent ambiguous with respect to the length of the poly(A) stretch. Reverse transcriptase experiments point in the direction of a heterogeneity in the length of the A stretch of 5-10 nucleotides (Figures l-5) which is not observed in the Sl experiment ( Figure  6 ). This discrepancy might be due to an inability of the reverse transcriptase to read up to the methylated G-residue of the cap structure. Furthermore, homopolymeric stretches are relatively poorly transcribed even at high enzyme concentrations (Murphy et al., 1986) . The RNAase-cap selection experiments cannot completely rule out this possibility because the poly(A) sequence might be less susceptible to the RNAases under the test conditions. The exact length of the poly(A) stretch in the leader RNA can probably only be determined after the elucidation of the mechanism of poly-(A) addition.",
