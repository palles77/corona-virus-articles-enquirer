The goal of this study was to explore the potential effects of saw blade frequency and saw blade contact load on the number and size of airborne bone particles produced. The methodology involved the use of an oscillating saw with variable saw blade frequencies and different saw blade contact loads on dry human femora. Released airborne particles were counted per diameter by a particle counter inside a closed and controlled environment. Results corroborated with the hypotheses: higher frequencies or lower contact loads resulted in higher numbers of aerosol particles produced. However, it was found that even in the best-case scenario tested on dry bone, the number of aerosol particles produced was still high enough to provide a potential health risk to the forensic practitioners. Protective breathing gear such as respirators and biosafety protocols are recommended to be put into practice to protect forensic practitioners from acquiring pathologies, or from other biological hazards when performing autopsies.",

Different diagnoses ask for different examinations, some of which requiring incisions in superficial tissues to provide access to deeper internal tissues of the body. Since forensic practitioners are generally aware of potential hazards, protective clothing is used and protocols are followed to minimise contact with pathogens [1, 2] . Some contamination routes may seem more obvious than others due to explicit interaction with contaminants, such as through cuts by scalpels or punctures with needles. However, inhalation of infectious airborne particles during an autopsy could be as harmful as an accidental cut [2] [3] [4] . Powered surgical instruments, such as saws and drills, are greatly responsible for aerosolisation (solid or liquid airborne particles) of body tissues, exposure to these aerosols may be considered an often overlooked contamination route [5, 6] .",

            "text": "Oscillating saws are routinely used during autopsies, when forensic practitioners are required to make deep incisions through bone or cartilage tissues, oscillating saws have an advantage due to an increased ease of use and accessibility compared to hand or band saws. There is however a concern about the production of suspended particles (aerosols) when operating the saw. Aerosols produced by sawing can be dispersed wide in the surroundings of the site of operation, possibly reaching the respiratory tract of the operator [5, [7] [8] [9] . The aerosol's particle size determines the potential invasion depth of the aerosol in the inhaler's respiratory tract, as reported in [3] , and can possibly act as a pathway for hazardous diseases [10] . For example, for particles of 0.1 mm about 2.1% will only reach the head airways, 2.7% will reach the tracheobronchial region and 14% will end up in the alveoli. For particles of 10 mm this would be 81%, 1.5% and 1.9%, respectively. Particles smaller than 10 mm are within the respirable range [3] and have the potential to remain suspended in the air for long periods of time, increasing the time during which the air around the working area is contaminated with possibly infective aerosol [9] . Among the hazardous pathogens are Hepatitis B and C, Streptococci, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), of which transmissions have already been recorded during autopsy sessions [11] [12] [13] [14] . When inhaling such pathogens, a minimal infective dose (MID) is required to actually produce an infection. Most respiratory viruses appear to have infectious potential in humans even with low doses [15] . Concern also emerges towards unknown MIDs, as this serves as motivation for prophylaxis, see Table 1 .",

The distance between the bone specimen and the particle counter's sensor was about 450 mm, to replicate the breathing zone of the saw operator. Particles were counted at a flow of 2.83 l/m in six different sizes: 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 10 mm. It was decided that sizes over 10 mm were not of relevance to the current study, as particles of these sizes are most likely to deposit in the head airway region of the respiratory tract, whereas smaller particles will primarily deposit in the alveoli (see Introduction) [3, 5, 12, 16] .",

The results suggest that, for all particle sizes, contact loads and sawing frequencies tested, increasing the contact load exerted by the saw blade on the bone has an inverse effect on the number of aerosol particles produced. The same effect was seen when considering the total number of aerosol particles, as well as the total surface area of a particles produced. Analysing the effect of frequency on particle production, it was demonstrated that higher frequencies result in a higher number of aerosol particles produced for the smaller particle sizes, except for particles of size 10.0 mm. The deviating results for 10.0 mm aerosol particles could be explained as these bigger particles are more susceptible to disturbances, such as air resistance. Therefore these bigger particles might have taken more time than smaller particles to evenly diffuse throughout the box and reach the particle counter.",

There was however a limit to those parameters, as it was necessary to observe the saw's torque threshold: frequencies lower than 150 Hz or contact loads higher than 5 kg could lead to engine halts or failure to cut through the bone. Similarly, the cutting time was affected by the used saw blade contact loads and saw blade frequency, which together with a possible change in quality of cut could be a reason why forensic practitioners use these sawing parameters.",

Reversely, the total surface area of the produced particles was dominated by the production of 10 .0 mm particles, as their surface area is roughly 1000 times bigger than that of the 0.3 mm particles. The stacked bar graphs of the 10.0 mm particles and of the total surface area of particles show similar trends between ECs. The total number of particles produced is of interest as it indicates a number of potential pathways for pathogens to the human body. Similarly, the total surface area gives an indication of the possible amount of pathogens that could be attached to one particle. As different pathogens have different sizes and MIDs, as shown in Table 1 , it could well be that some of the counted particles are the pathogen themselves, or one particle can carry enough pathogens to acquire the MID. Lastly, even non-pathogen-carrying particles might pose health risks through mechanisms similar to the risk of inhaling asbestos particles. The effects of sawing in dry bone could differ from fresh bone due to increased presence of organic matter in fresh bone. This organic matter is mainly composed of collagen, granting greater bone elasticity, whereas diminishing organic content in dry bone changes the elastic properties from viscoelastic to brittle [19, 20] .",

Combining these findings with recommendations from other studies could further reduce the intake of bone dust when using oscillating saws: i.e. adaptations with protective casing around the saw blade [5] or moistening the saw blade to reduce spread of particles [7, 22] . Similarly, the use of protective gear, such as specialised, well-fitted respirators and filtering face pieces [16, 23] , as well as guideline inspections to ensure proper infrastructure of autopsy facilities could greatly reduce the number of aerosol particles reaching the respiratory tracts of forensic practitioners.",

Similarly, workers in environments without means to acquire ventilation systems, or where the reduction the spreading of dust is hard to achieve, e.g. in field work, emergency response work, or practices in less developed or poorer countries, could improve their bone sawing protocols with the results of the current study. Future studies should investigate realistic scenarios faced by forensic practitioners, such as aerosolisation of fresh bone instead of dry archaeological bone. Furthermore, testing different bone types (e.g. long, short, flat, irregular or sesamoid bones), and testing additional sawing parameters (such as the morphology of the saw blade), and their effects on aerosol production could be investigated.
