Although being a health care worker appears to be protective, the association is not significant, probably because only 1 health care worker had died of MERS as of July 15, 2015. Time from onset to diagnosis was not an indicator for death, which suggests that the rapidity with which a patient receives supportive care may be of marginal consequence. Similarly, although being a male patient seems to increase odds of death, this relationship was not significant.",

Because 19 (10%) of 186 case-patients reported remain hospitalized, the final CFR of the outbreak might be higher than our current estimate. However, the proportion of patients who died (18%-19%) has been fairly stable since June 27 (Figure 2) , which might indicate an asymptotic approach toward the final outbreak-specified CFR (5-7). If so, the final CFR associated with the MERS outbreak in South Korea during 2015 might be <22%. If all remaining hospitalized case-patients died, the final outbreak CFR would be 29%, which provides an upper limit for our current estimate of 22% excluding additional cases.",

This finding is comparable to that in a MERS study in Saudi Arabia, which reported a 60% CFR for a study population in which 45 (96%) patients had concurrent health conditions (8) . Although only 25 (16%) case-patients had documented concurrent health conditions, the MERS outbreak in South Korean during 2015 has been largely nosocomial in nature. This finding suggests that observed differences between average CFRs in South Korea and Saudi Arabia might be driven in part by differential rates of concurrent health conditions for susceptible persons.",

Given these epidemiologic similarities and assuming that inherent virulence of MERS coronavirus is not context specific, the CFR difference might be caused not only by differential prevalence of risk factors but also by treatment or surveillance disparities. Time to diagnosis decreased during the first 7 outbreak weeks, which probably contributed to the reduced length of hospitalization for patients who recovered and indicates that supportive care in South Korea might be highly adaptive. Furthermore, as reported by Cowling et al. (11) , intensive case-finding activities might have produced more comprehensive diagnosis and reporting, thereby capturing less severe cases. In either event, given the frequency of importation events (12) and propensity for super-spreading (13), these findings provide information about MERS and MERS coronavirus in South Korea that might be useful in improving early case detection and preventing death.",
