It was chosen as one of eight types of traditional Chinese medicine that play a unique role in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) owing to the effect of curbing inflammation. In order to validate this plausible anti-inflammatory property, the chemical composition of HCI has been analysed by GC/MS, 22 components were identified, and the inflammation induced by carrageenan in the rat pleurisy model and by xylene in the mice ear edema model was adopted to study the anti-inflammatory activity of HCI. Injection of carrageenan into the pleural cavity elicited an acute inflammatory response characterized by protein rich fluid accumulation and leukocyte infiltration in the pleural cavity. The peak inflammatory response was obtained at 24 h when the fluid volume, protein concentration, C-reactive protein and cell infiltration were maximums. The results showed that these parameters were attenuated by HCI at any dose and touched bottom at dose of 0.54 ml/100 g, although less strong than dexamethasone. This drug was also effective in inhibiting xylene induced ear edema, and the percentage of inhibition came to 50% at dose of 80 l/20 g. The results clearly indicate that HCI have anti-inflammatory activity.",

The eight medicines were chosen from a long list of 30 medicines that have already been used in clinical treatment in SARS-hit Beijing and Guangdong Province in South China. The list included HCI that is effective in curbing inflammation of the lungs (http: //www.chinanews.com.cn, 2003) , different from other traditional medicines on the list which can lessen fever, chills, headaches, muscular pain, malaise, diarrhoea, a dry cough and a lack of phlegm. But this anti-inflammatory effect of HCI was rarely reported besides few papers that showed the water extract of dried plants of Houttuynia cordata has this kind of activity and antiedematous action (Song, 2002) . In order to test whether HCI possesses a plausible anti-inflammatory property, pleurisy induced by carrageenan and ear edema induced by xylene were thus used to study the anti-inflammatory activity of HCI in this work.

Pleurisy HCI at 0.27 ml/100 g, 0.54 ml/100 g, 1.08 ml/100 g body weight was injected once intravenously everyday and lasted for 6 days. The initial concentration of methyl nonyl ketone in HCI is 1.15 g/ml. While the reference drug dexamethasone at 0.27 ml/100 g lasted for 2 days. The initial concentration of dexamethasone is 8 mg/ml and its composition is C 22 H 28 FNa 2 O 8 . Pleurisy was induced by intra-thoracic injection of 0.1 ml of 2.0% carrageenan, 24 h after the last injection of tested drugs according to a previously described method (Xu et al., 2002) . Injection of carrageenan was given between the seventh and eighth ribs under the right upper limbs through a gauge needle, with penetration restricted to 6 mm by inserting carefully it through a rubber disc (Peters et al., 1999; Shivkar and Kumar, 2004) . Another injection of treatment drugs was given to animals 3 h after the inflammatory stimulus. Control animals received the irritant and an equal volume of sterile saline. The pleural cavity was opened and rinsed with 1 ml of cold saline containing 20 IU/ml heparin. The fluid was removed by mild suction and its volume was measured. It was evaluated for leukocyte count, protein and C-reactive protein. All parameters were compared with those of rats treated with dexamethasone and control animals.",

For example, the volume of pleural fluid increased from 0.05 \u00b1 0.12 ml at 0 h to 0.95 \u00b1 0.24 ml at 24 h and decreased to 0.70 \u00b1 0.22 ml at 48 h. While protein concentration of the exudate when measured at different time-intervals showed an increase from 2.32 \u00b1 1.78 at 0 h to 26.18 \u00b1 2.18 mg/ml at 24 h and decline to 18.06 \u00b1 2.12 mg/ml at 48 h. The similar trend of the cell counts and C-reactive protein was observed. The anti-inflammatory effect of HCI was studied on carrageenan induced pleurisy and compared with that of dexamethasone used as a standard drug. The anti-inflammatory effect of the drugs was studied at 24 h. All dose of the antiinflammatory drugs produced a significant decrease in the exudate volume as compared to the control (0.95 \u00b1 0.24 ml). Although the anti-inflammation of HCI at any dose is less strong than that of dexamethasone (Table 2) , HCI at three doses showed the significant difference with respect to control. The protein concentration of the exudates administrated by three doses decreased from 26.18 \u00b1 2.18 mg/ml with administration of sterile saline to 5.47 \u00b1 5.35, 3.35 \u00b1 2.18, and 4.00 \u00b1 1.67 mg/ml, respectively and the effect at dose of 0.54 ml/100 g is comparable to that of dexamethasone (Table 2 ). This should be the result of HCI decreasing the capillary permeability. But to suppress the inflammatory cell influx and reduce C-reactive protein concentration, HCI at dose of 0.27 ml/100 g was of no effect compared to the dose of 0.54 ml/100 g, 1.08 ml/100 g and dexamethasone (Table 2) . From the data in Table 2 , the anti-inflammatory effect of HCI on carrageenan induced pleurisy at 0.54 ml/100 g or more is preferable.",

The xyleneinduced mouse ear edema method has certain advantages for natural product testing and has a good predictive value for screening anti-inflammatory agents (Jacobs et al., 1985) . The effect of HCI on xylene-induced ear edema in mice is shown in Table 3 . Topical application of xylene induced cutaneous inflammation at the ears of mice and caused significant increase in ear plug weight of the right ear when compared to the left ear. When HCI was hypodermically applied at dose of 40, 80, 160, 240 and 320 l per 20 g body weight, it provided inhibitory effect on xylene-induced ear edema formation in a dose-dependent manner (Table 3) . Treatment of HCI at 80 l/20 g gave 50% inhibition in ear plug weight (Table 3 ), indicating that HCI contains anti-inflammatory activity. As a positive control, dexamethasone (40 l/20 g) gave rise to a significant inhibition of 73% in ear plug weight (Table 3) . It is noted that the effect after the treatment of HCI at dose of 320 l/20 g is of no significance. This may be attributed to extra dose bringing hypodermic damage and inflammation again. As a result, the anti-inflammatory effect of this dose decreased.",
