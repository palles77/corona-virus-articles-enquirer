A number of restriction endonuclease enzymes were assessed for recognition of the amplicons so produced. The assay was shown to detect viral RNA from all of the 26 different TGEV and PRCV isolates examined, covering a period from 1946 to 1996. Detection of TGEV in clinical specimens was possible using a spin column method to extract RNA and sensitivity was compared to virus isolation and antigen detection ELISA. The method could provide a means of confirming positive results from immunological screening tests such as FAT and ELISA, reducing the need for virus isolation and convalescent serology. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

The causative virus, TGEV, is a member of the coronaviridae, and has a large, single-strand, positive sense RNA genome.

            "text": "Rapid methods for the detection of TGEV are important because of the highly contagious nature of the disease. Since the virus is often difficult to adapt to growth in cell cultures, the most widely used techniques are immunological, principally a fluorescent antibody test (FAT) for cryostat sections of intestine and an antigen ELISA for detection of virus in faeces (Paton, 1992) . Differentiation of TGEV from the closely related PRCV is possible using anti-S protein monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against non-neutralising antigenic sites that are lacking in PRCV (Garwes et al., 1988; Callebaut et al., 1988) . There are also reports of the use of DNA probes and of RT-PCR as detectors of TGEV RNA (Bae et al., 1991; Vaughn et al., 1996; Wesley et al., 1991; Jackwood et al., 1995) but the methods were not shown to be suitable for the direct detection of virus in clinical samples. An in situ hybridization method for detection of TGEV and PRCV has been reported, but requires tissues rather than faeces (Sirinarumitr et al., 1996) . Here we report the development of an RT-PCR method for the detection and differentiation of TGEV/PRCV. A total of 25 archived viruses were examined in this study, mainly European, but also including isolates from North America and Japan (Table 1) . The viruses had been passaged to varying extents ( > 60 in some cases) in a variety of cell cultures. To prepare stocks for this study, viruses were passaged in a pig kidney cell line (LLCPKl, Flow), maintained in modified Eagle's medium with 10% foetal calf serum.",

The TGE virus isolated from the case was designated 96-1933. Two faecal samples and three samples of small intestine were obtained from three-week-old pigs with diarrhoea. A sample of intestine was homogenised in PBS and fed to four five-day-old piglets held in isolation and fed on milk replacer. Profuse diarrhoea began within 18 h in all pigs and 8 faeces samples were collected over the next 6 h, after which the pigs were euthanased. Faeces samples from the field case and the experimentally infected pigs were all TGEV positive in a routinely used ELISA (Paton, 1992) . The dilution at which TGEV could be detected in ELISA was between 10W2 and 10e4. FAT on cryostat sections of intestine, using a commercial source of TGEV antiserum (VMRD, Inc.), confirmed TGEV antigen in two out of three of the field samples and in all four pigs inoculated experimentally. Clarified, 10% homogenates of intestine and faeces from both the field outbreak and the subsequent experimentallyinduced cases were used to inoculate cell cultures for attempted virus isolation as previously described (Paton, 1992) . Cell cultures used included secondary pig kidney, LLCPKl , secondary canine kidney and a canine rectal tumour cell line (A72). In each case, except for the secondary pig kidney cultures, virus isolation was attempted with and without added trypsin (10 pg/ml, with daily medium renewal). The 96-1933 isolate grew very poorly in the cell types assessed. No cpe was evident in any culture after four blind passages, with or without added trypsin, but immunostaining revealed a small number of infected plaques in cells within the A72 and LLCPKl cultures. Tenfold dilution of the inoculum from the third cell culture pass lead to complete loss of detectable infectivity at the fourth passage.",

Earlier experiments had shown an increase in sensitivity of up to ten-fold, when disruption buffer was used instead of PBS (data not shown). The suspensions were clarified by centrifugation at 2000 g for 2 min and 140 ~1 of supernatant was used in QIAamp spin-column kits, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Ten per cent intestinal homogenates in PBS plus antibiotics were clarified by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min. Thereafter, 140 ~1 aliquots were processed in QIAamp kits as above. All of the faeces samples were positive by RT-PCR, and the same two out of three pigs from the source outbreak for 96-1933 were positive for TGEV using both FAT on cryostat sections of intestine and RT-PCR on gut homogenates. To assess the sensitivity of the RT-PCR, three positive faeces samples were diluted in ten fold steps in disruption buffer, prior to extraction of RNA. The dilutions at which TGEV could be detected in the three samples were lo-', 10W5, and 10W6 for RT-PCR, compared to 10W2, 10e4, and 10e2 respectively for ELISA.",

However, in many European countries, TGEV has been either absent or present at very low levels in the last ten years. In such circumstances, a positive diagnosis of TGEV becomes more significant, and it may be necessary to confirm diagnoses made by antigen detection tests using an independent assay procedure. Serology is an option, but suffers from two disadvantages. Firstly, rapid diagnosis may not be possible, due to the need to allow time for convalescence and antibody development. Secondly, it usually requires a repeat visit to the farm to be made, for the appropriate samples to be collected. There are reports of the development of nucleic acid probes for detection of TGEV RNA (Bae et al., 1991; Vaughn et al., 1996; Wesley et al., 1991) , but the methods did not describe direct use on clinical samples and may lack sensitivity for such work.",

Nevertheless, a recent field isolate (96-1933) that was not readily grown in cell culture was detected with a strong RT-PCR signal, using faeces or intestine submitted from the field case. Another TGEV isolate (85-45210) could not be recovered in cell culture from an archived frozen stock of liquid culture supernatant, but an RT-PCR product was amplified. Furthermore, sequencing revealed that the amplicons obtained from each of these two viruses were unique (data not shown).",
