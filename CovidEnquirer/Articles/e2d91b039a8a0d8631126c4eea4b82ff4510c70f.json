However, in February 2017, outbreaks of severe diarrhea occurred in swine herds vaccinated against PEDV in Guangdong, China. All ill pigs showed severe watery diarrhea, and their clinical onset occurred a few days later than those infected with PEDV. In initial tests with reverse transcription PCR using specific primers for PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine group A rotavirus, or porcine deltacoronavirus, none of these viruses could be detected in all clinical samples.

We randomly selected 2 inoculated pigs in each group and performed necropsies on days 3 and 5 postinoculation, respectively. We filtrated homogenate of small intestine and intestinal contents, using the resultant supernatant for RNA extraction as described previously (2) . We extracted total RNA by using a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and eliminated ribosomal RNA with the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

According to the phylogenetic tree, the position of GDS04 is between HKU2 and BtRf alphacoronavirus. The HKU2 strain was identified in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, China, in 2007 (6), and the BtRf alphacoronavirus strain was detected in China in 2012 (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_028824.1). Both viruses are bat-associated viruses. However, the 2 strains are distributed in relatively different branches (Figure) . Based on a comprehensive comparative analysis of the genomes of various groups of coronaviruses, we classified GDS04 as an alphacoronavirus. Our sequence analysis revealed that GDS04 has 80% nt and 87% aa identity with the spike (S) protein of the HKU2 strain. Moreover, the S protein of the GDS04 genome is 6 bp longer than the S protein in the HKU2 strain, which has the smallest S protein among all coronaviruses. Nevertheless, the GDS04 strain shares 95.7% aa identity with HKU2 in nonstructural protein (nsp) 3 (adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1\u2032-phosphatase), 96.4% in nsp5 (3C-like protease), 94.6% in nsp12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), 99.8% in nsp13 (helicase), 99.2% in nsp14 (3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease), 99.4% in nsp15 (poly[U]specific endoribonuclease), and 97.6% in nsp16 (2'-O-ribose methyltransferase). These nonstructural proteins are Coronaviridae-wide conserved domains in replicase polyprotein pp1ab. A threshold of >90% in aa sequence identity suggests that 2 viruses are of the same species; our findings suggest that the GDS04 strain belongs to the same species as HKU2.",

            "text": "High frequencies of antimicrobial drug resistance were observed in O157 and non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli strains recovered from patients in Michigan during 2010-2014. Resistance was more common in non-O157 strains and independently associated with hospitalization, indicating that resistance could contribute to more severe disease outcomes.S higa toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) contributes to 265,000 cases of foodborne illness annually in the United States (1) . Most infections are caused by O157 strains; however, non-O157 STEC infections have increased (2) . Antimicrobial drug resistance among STEC has been reported (3-5) but is probably underestimated. Given the importance of resistance in E. coli pathotypes, we sought to determine the prevalence of resistant STEC infections and assess the effects of resistance on disease.We (Table) . Resistance to ampicillin (7.4%) was most common, followed by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (4.0%) and ciprofloxacin (0.3%). Compared with national rates, resistance to ampicillin and SXT was higher, but not significantly different, for O157 isolates from Michigan (online Technical Appendix Figure 1 , https://wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/23/9/17-0523-Techapp1.pdf) (6). One strain was resistant to all drugs, and all resistant strains had high MICs (ampicillin, >64 \u03bcg/mL; ciprofloxacin, >32 \u03bcg/ mL; SXT, in 1:19 ratio, >32/608 \u03bcg/mL). Notably, resistance was twice as common for non-O157 (11.1%) than for O157 (5.5%) strains. O111 strains (n = 7) had significantly higher resistance frequencies (24.1%) than other non-O157 serogroups (p = 0.03). We found variation by year and season; resistance frequencies were highest in 2012 (online Technical Appendix, Figure 2 ) and during winter/spring (online Technical Appendix Table 1 ), but neither trend was significant. We also observed a strong but nonsignificant association between resistance and hospitalization but no association for urban versus rural residence (7) or county after stratifying by prescription rates (8) in the univariate analyses.We conducted a multivariate analysis using logistic regression, with hospitalization as the dependent variable; we included variables with significant (p<0.05) and strong (p<0.20) associations from the univariate analysis as independent variables. Forward selection indicated that hospitalized patients were more likely to have resistant infections (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.00-5.82) and less likely to have non-O157 infections (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.21-0.61) (online Technical Appendix Table 2 ), suggesting that resistant infections or O157 infections may cause more severe clinical outcomes. Patients >18 years of age, women, and patients with bloody diarrhea were also more likely to be hospitalized.Although we found no significant difference by stx profile, strains possessing stx1 only were more commonly resistant than strains with stx2 alone (p = 0.27 by Fisher exact test).
