The harmonized management of biological risks in such diverse laboratories thus appears as a real challenge. Zhejiang Province in China has taken the initiative to establish a comprehensively integrated laboratory biosafety management system called SINS (Standardization, Informatization, Normalization and Systematization). The SINS model system has been introduced and adopted in 1,721 BSL-2 laboratories in Zhejiang Province, and thus lead to an increase in the number of biosafety committees from 20% to more than 95% from 2007 to 2018, and the number of biosafety laboratory managers who knows biosafety-related laws and regulations increase from 52.7% to 83.7% from 2009 to 2017. Such achievements indicate that the successful implementation of SINS model has increased the effective control of biological risks in BSL-2 laboratories of the Zhejiang Province. SINS model and its main effects on leading the improvement of laboratory biosafety management was presented in this review. The SINS model helps to strengthen laboratory biosafety and thus effectively reduces occurrence of biosafety-related incidences. This model can potentially be used by other regions or countries where harmonized biosafety management system is still under-developing.",

Pathogenic microorganisms are classified into four categories according to China's regulations on the laboratory biosafety management of pathogenic microorganisms [6] . The first type refers to those microorganisms which cause very serious disease in humans or animals, and has not been declared eliminated in China. The second type refers to the microorganisms which cause serious disease in humans or animals, and can be easily transmitted directly or indirectly from human to human, from animal to human, or between animals. Both types of microorganism are collectively referred as \"high pathogenic agents\", since they are more susceptible to human and animal; thus easily cause significant impact to health of human and animals. Diagnostic and experimental activi-ties on \"high pathogenicity agents\" should be carried out in Biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories or higher level biosafety laboratories. There have been numbers of such certified BSL-2 laboratories in China for conducting activities of the \"high pathogenicity agents\". For example, the preliminary screening of HIV is actually carried out in many diagnostic BSL-2 laboratories.",

Zhejiang Province is located on the southeast coast of China and west to the Pacific Ocean. It has subtropical monsoon climate and an area of 101,800 km 2 with a population of more than 55 million peoples. As of August 20, 2019, Zhejiang Province has 2 BSL-3, 1,721 BSL-2, and more than 500 BSL-1 laboratories. Significant efforts have been implemented in recent years to strengthen the management and safety of all those laboratories. Establishment of SINS ( Figure 1 ) counts as part of these efforts and SINS has been applied gradually for the development of a harmonized management approach of these BSL-2 laboratories [15] .",
