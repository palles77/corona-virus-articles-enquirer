Given the proven importance of the Adult Respiratory Medicine syllabus from both a national and international standpoint, it is of equal importance that said syllabus remains abreast of emerging trends so as to sustain the synchronisation of respiratory medicine in Europe. In order to develop an updated programme, a comprehensive review process of the current syllabus is a necessary endeavour and a step that the European Respiratory Society (ERS) has undertaken through the process of a needs assessment. ERS international Adult Respiratory Medicine syllabus for postgraduate training fulfilled with the publication of the curriculum in 2008. Based on these documents, the ERS HERMES examination was established to standardise the certification of knowledge following the completion of national training programmes in adult respiratory medicine [3] . The ERS HERMES summer schools were established and educational resources, such as the ERS Handbook of Respiratory Medicine, were produced to provide preparatory support for the exam. Furthermore, fundamental criteria required to provide quality training in adult respiratory medicine were defined for training centres in collaboration with EBAP. The target audience was postgraduate trainees.",

Ury et al. [6] outline that needs assessment is a vital component in the infancy stages of any curriculum design, forming part of the foundational platform on which a working curriculum is built; however, it does not end after implementation. Instead, it is an ongoing process \"which continues to provide important and useful information and feedback that ensures the sustainability of the curriculum\" [6] . Using a range of different methods, such as questionnaire surveys, focus groups, interviews and the notable Delphi method, a needs assessment has come to be recognised as a necessary and worthwhile endeavour in curriculum planning and development. Given the proven merits of the Delphi method, it was the intention of the ERS task force to employ this form of needs assessment to both inform and prioritise certain needs based upon the results of the situational analysis as well as ascertaining the specifics of what should be included within an Adult Respiratory Medicine training programme.",

Feedback from the respondents suggested that these techniques were too specialised and only available in select medical centres. Additionally, EUS is not implemented in all hospitals and seen as complementary to EBUS. The task force considered these comments and decided to merge EUS and EBUS as only knowledge about the technique, the indications and the basic technical aspects will be required by a number of pulmonologists. The ERS recognises, however, the rapidly growing need for EBUS and EUS expertise and the major technical advances within the interventional area and thus assume that these techniques will be included in the syllabus in the future.",

Comprising a simplified structure with fewer modules, the reviewed syllabus is designed to act as a guide for educational design, the planning of teaching and learning, and assessment structures as well as resource activities, supporting the ERS and other institutions using the ERS syllabus. Given the scope of this project, the needs assessment process was not without its limitations, although its merits certainly outweighed the aforementioned challenges.
