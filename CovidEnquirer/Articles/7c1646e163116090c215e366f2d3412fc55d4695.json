The major glycoprotein, gp180/90, forms the projecting spikes or peplomers . These are important for cell attachment (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) and may influence tropism for specific tissues . The minor glycoprotein, gp25, is largely an internal protein, although a small segment projects through the virion envelope (Sturman, 1982) . This protein is probably analogous to the matrix protein of other enveloped viruses and is thought to play a role in the control of viral maturation and establishment of virion stability (Holmes et at, 1982) . The nucleocapsid protein, ppGO, is intimately associated with the viral RNA . The simplicity of the struc-ture of the virion makes the MHV group an ideal subject for comparative studies of pathogenesis, as, in principle, variations in disease patterns can be correlated with changes in protein structure.",

Briefly, 25-\u00b5l serial dilutions of antibody (heat inactivated at 56\u00b0 for 30 min) were added to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate ; subsequently, 25 \u00b5l of a virus suspension containing 10-TCID6\" d o s e s ( 5 0 % t i s s u e c u l t u r e infective doses) was added to each well . The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 for 1 hr, and then 2 X 10\u00b0DBT cells were added to each well . The neutralizing titer was expressed as the highest dilution of antibody w h i c h p r e v e n t e d C P E i n 5 0 % o f t h e w e l l s . Antibody binding assay. The solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) for antiviral antibodies has been described previously (Fleming et al, 1983) . Viral antigens were used in excess; preliminary assays showed that each virus stock contained sufficient antigen to produce maximal binding with a hyperimmune anti-MHV standard serum. After cloning, 25 \u00b5l of supernatant from established hybridomas was assayed at 10 -1 dilution. Serial dilutions of antibody showed that this concentration fell within the linear region of the assay . In'eross reactive RIA, the binding of antibodies at 10-1 dilution was tested against homologous virus (JHMV-DL) and compared to the binding to heterologous viruses .",

Since viral antigens were used in excess and binding of antibodies to the glycoproteins of JHMV-DS was equal to the binding to the glycoproteins of homologous virus (see below), we do not attribute the very low binding of antibodies to JHMV-DS nucleocapsid protein, pp6O, to limited antigenic density of the viral preparation. Anti-pp6O monoclonal antibodies did not react with control viral antigens, and control monoclonal antibody did not react with MHV antigens . The relative binding of antibodies to different MHV strains in a larger series of experiments was used to construct the block diagram presented in Fig . 2 . The pattern of reactivities indicates a moderate degree of antigenic conservation of ppGO among MHV strains . By inspection, the viruses tested could be divided into two broad groups based on their reactivities . The first group consisted of A59, MHV-3, MHV-D, MHV-K, and MHV-Nuu viruses, all of which did not react with monoclonal antibodies J.1.1, J .3.14, J.3.7, and J .3.15 . The antigenic sites recognized by these antibodies are apparently conserved in the second group, composed of MHV-2, MHV-S, and MHV-1 viruses . In addition to these two groups, two individual viruses, JHMV-DS and MHV-M, were notable for their l a c k o f m a r k e d b i n d i n g ( l e s s t h a n 2 5 % r p m versus homologous virus) with any of the 10 anti-pp60 monoclonal antibodies tested .

The major virion envelope glycoprotein, gplSO/90, is capable of a number of functions, including recognition of the host cell receptor (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . It was therefore of interest to investigate the antigenic relationships of gp18O/90 in a number of different MHV strains which produce a variety of diseases. All monoclonal antibodies recognized antigenic determinants of the small plaque variant JHMV-DS equally well as the immunogen, JHMV-DL, indicating the close antigenic relationship of 'Monoclonal antibodies were obtained from hybridoma tissue culture supernatants.

Assessment by RIA and RIP showed that the degree of conservation of JHMV-DL antigens, as judged by this panel of antibodies, varied among the three principal MHV structural proteins.

Recently, oligonucleotide fingerprints of mRNA No . 7, which encodes pp60, were studied in JHMV-DL and JHMV-DS. The fingerprints of the two variants were indistinguishable (Lai, unpublished observations) . We presently have no firm explanation for the difference between the data obtained with monoclonal antibodies and oligonucleotide fingerprinting . Very likely, the monoclonal antibodies detected antigenic sites which are represented by genetic sequences not detectable by T 1 -oligonucleotide fingerprinting . This striking result implies that there is a significant antigenic change in the nucleocapsid protein of the small plaque variant, JHMV-DS . The lack of antigenic differences among JHMV-DL and JHMV-DS in the other two virion proteins suggests that the change in pp60 may be correlated with differences in pathogenicity between the two viruses (Stohlman, et at, 1982) . However, this conclusion is provisional and should be supported by further studies, such as the analysis of nonstructural proteins and the complete sequencing of the genomes of the viruses . Gp180/90 is an external protein which serves as the target for neutralizing antibody, induces cell fusion, and may play a key role in determining host cell range (Holmes et at, 1982; Collins et at, 1982) .",

The fact that these antigenic divisions to some extent correlate with pathogenicity raises the possibility that pp60 may play an important role in disease potential . However, genetic regions coding for other gene products may contain alterations which would result in variations not detectable in this study, as shown pre-viously by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of -HMV-DL and JHMV-DS (Stohlman et at, 1982) . Therefore, these conclusions should be considered tentative . Also, the major glycoprotein, gp180/90,is highly variable and may be expected to influence viral pathogenicity, e.g., by controlling tropism for specific cell types . This has already been suggested in one study in which relative hepatotropism among MHV strains may be correlated with changes in the gene for gp180/90 . Taken together, these findings imply that determinants on both gp180/90 and pp60 of MHV may play critical differential roles in pathogenesis. Such a conclusion would be consistent with the detailed information available concerning the genetic and molecular bases of pathogenicity of influenza (Rott, 1979) and reoviruses (Fields and Greene, 1982) . For these viruses, virulence has been shown to be multigenic, although individual genes are responsible for different aspects of pathogenesis. Further studies, including an evaluation of the role of nonstructural proteins, will be needed to extend these conclusions to the murine coronaviruses .",
