This can be tested by culturing macrophages from a group of mice and then backcrossing the mice whose macrophages are susceptible, to the inbred strain of C3H mice. Using this method, it has been possible to introduce the gene for susceptibility into previously resistant mice3 Now, after some 20 backcrosses, a line of susceptible C3H mice is available which differs from the resistant C~H mice presumably by only one gene, the gene for susceptiblity to mouse hepatitis virus. The gene for susceptibility has remained completely manifest and dominant despite other factors in the genetic background of the C3H mice. Since susceptibility to this virus seems to be unifactorial, it is of interest to try to determine the nature of the difference between the resistant and the susceptible cells.",

This fact is important in view of a change in host-range which occurred when large amounts of virus were inoculated onto C3H cultures, an event described in the following paper (7) . DISCUSSION Since there are now known to be a series of steps from adsorption to ingestion, uncoating, etc., before animal viruses start to develop within the cell, it may be expected that at any given stage a cell may fail to support, i.e. be resistant to, a virus. In this study it has been shown that genetically resistant and susceptible cells are equally able to adsorb and to apparently ingest the virus. This agrees with the findings of Piraino (8) and Crittenden (9; 10) on Rous sarcoma virus, and suggests that resistance to MHV(PRI) occurs at some stage after adsorption.",

This sharp decrease did not occur in C~H cells. Further, PRI cells gave rise to newly synthesized virus, while C3H cells did not. The combined findings suggest that nonpermissiveness of C3H cells lies in their failure to support viral replication. It is still possible that among the total C3H macrophage populations there are a few permissive cells.

Thus, inability to suport the growth of MHV(PRI) does not stem from a generalized failure of C3H cells to support virus, but is due to a specific failure to support MHV which has been grown in PRI mice. SUMMARY Peritoneal macrophages from genetically resistant C3H mice and genetically susceptible Princeton (PRI) mice adsorbed the MHV (PRI) strain of mouse hepatitis virus equally well. The difference between the permissive cells and the nonpermissive ones seems to reside in the ability of the former to \"eclipse\" the virus and, subsequently, support virus replication. C3H cells exposed to low multiplicities of the virus remained intact with no demonstrable viral replication. Virus, taken up by the resistant cells, was protected from heat and underwent slow inactivation while few or no virus particles were released into the medium.",
