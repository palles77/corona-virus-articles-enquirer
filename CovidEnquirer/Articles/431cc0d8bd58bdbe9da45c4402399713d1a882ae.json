The approach ties public health alerts into the diagnostic process and allows clinicians to more easily determine when an observed medical condition may be related to a more widespread disease outbreak. A prototype Alert Knowledge Repository (AKR) service using this approach was demonstrated within the Health Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) and the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) interoperability showcases in April and September 2009, respectively.",

When the West Nile virus was introduced to the United States in 1999, there was little experience in U.S. healthcare communities with this virus, which can cause a severe neuroinvasive disease in about 20 percent of those infected [1] . Beginning in February 2003, a communicable respiratory disease known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), later found to be caused by a previously unknown coronavirus, rapidly spread from China to 37 countries [2] in a matter of months, resulting in 8,098 known cases and 774 deaths. In the summer of 2008, peppers containing Salmonella serotype Saintpaul caused the largest recorded food borne outbreak in the United States [3] . In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the spread of a novel H1N1 variety of influenza had reached Phase 6 pandemic levels [4] . These new and emerging diseases pose widespread public health risks and highlight the need for closer communications between health care providers and public health officials responsible for monitoring health risks. This need is greater in an environment where additional demands are being placed on limited public health resources.",

The meeting resulted in collaboration among the CDC, General Electric (GE) Healthcare, the University of Utah (UT), and The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL). In particular, the participants determined that electronic medical records (EMRs) may potentially enhance the delivery of care by having the most recent public health alert information available for the clinician during the encounter with the patient. An emerging technical specification for EMRs, known as the T.81 or the Retrieval of Medical Knowledge Transaction construct [5] , uses the Context-Aware Information Retrieval (Infobutton) as a mechanism to obtain additional health information. Using the T.81 EMR transaction, JHU/APL created an Alert Knowledge Repository (AKR) that permits clinicians to view relevant high priority public health alerts that correspond to the patient they are currently seeing. This article describes a prototype AKR that was demonstrated within the interoperability showcases of two national conferences.",

[6] described a local health information network established in Indiana that included medical record information from fifteen hospitals, and served public health functions for county and state health departments. Maro et al. [7] discussed potential uses of a more general distributed health data network and described how such a network might serve the needs of multiple users, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. McMurry et al. [8] discussed the feasibility of an architectural model of a national health data network that uses the Shared Pathology Informatics Network [9] as a template for protecting patient privacy and providing authorized access. Hills et al. [10] described demonstrations of a model health information exchange (HIE) that uses existing semantic and syntactic standards to support data transfer in three types of scenarios: biosurveillance, case reporting, and vaccination. The CDC established a nationwide Health Alert Network (HAN) that provides communications, information, distance-learning, and organizational infrastructure to link local and state health departments to each other and to community first-responders, hospitals and private laboratories. The CDC HAN messaging system is currently capable of directly and indirectly transmitting Health Alerts, Advisories, and Updates. However, transmission is unidirectional and occurs when the state health department transmits an alert, instead of being viewed on demand by the recipient [11] .",

The AKR then matches all health alerts relevant to the chief complaint and demographics of the patient, and replies to this query by sending all active public health alerts pertaining to the current health conditions of the patient. Public health alerts retrieved this way can contain the information on the public health event (e.g., case counts, location; disease details; diagnostic procedures; prevention and treatment options; and reporting information). The EMR system can record the alerts viewed by the clinician for further reference and provide a mechanism to allow the clinician to give feedback on the relevancy of the alerts. This feedback may be conveyed back to the AKR, providing public health officials with data on diagnostic relevance of the generated alerts, alert usage, and potential new cases.",

InfoShare was developed in close collaboration with local public health agencies as part of a public health translational research effort [14] . InfoShare protects the information from unauthorized access, while allowing surveillance monitors in one public health agency to interpret their own data and share their analyses with surveillance monitors in other public health agencies. To mitigate personal health information privacy concerns, the information messages being shared adequately describe the public health situation without requiring identifiable data to be exposed. By using a grid-enabled Web-services interface, a modified standalone version of the Infoshare application was created to share information with users of the National Center of Public Health Informatics (NCPHI) public health research grid [15] . The Web-interface component of the service provides a user-friendly means of data entry and promotes the entry of information into structured fields to enable computer readability. These structured fields permit the information to be used by other visualization, algorithm, decision support, and messaging tools.",

For the AKR, the application was modified to provide for the posting of public health alerts derived from epidemiological investigations or from automated syndromic surveillance system alerts. When such investigations are determined by public health officials to be considered of epidemiological and clinical significance, the public health officials may then automatically upload the alert information via the AMWI interface. The archive of alerts provides a repository of immediate public health concerns that may be viewed by public health agencies and also queried by clinicians requesting alert information through their EMR. Software developers from GE Healthcare made modifications to GE's Centricity EMR to enable it to connect to the prototype AKR. This concept was then demonstrated using the JHU/APL AKR as a Web service, the GE Centricity EMR with the T.81 construct implemented, and the Internet. Figure 2 illustrates the internal components of the AKR, including the AMWI user interface, a chief complaint text processor, an alert/patient relevance processor, a T.81 message request receiver, a Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) alert explorer, and the alert database.

This AKR service utilizes a Web-based secure interface to allow authorized public health officials and clinicians to view and query a database of public health alerts created by public health officials. These public health alerts contain information that may include free text descriptions and interpretations, links to Web sites with additional text and graphical information, and color-coded levels of concern provided by the public health official. These alerts are processed and archived so that they may be shared among public health agencies and queried by clinicians. Clinicians can use the patient's EMR to perform a query to find a match between a de-identified profile describing their patient's symptoms and any public health alerts that may be of concern. Therefore, the public health alerts are available to the physician at the time and point of care in lieu of an E-mail or fax distributed via an alerting system.",

However, the AKR service already has the potential to allow bidirectional communication between clinicians and public health officials with minimal risk to patient privacy. The public health officials would be able to obtain improved disease incidence information and contact information of the physician or hospital seeing the relevant patients so that they may assist in follow-up and public health intervention. To reduce the burden placed on clinicians and prevent \"alert fatigue,\" the EMR system could be used to mark alerts as \"acknowledged\" to ensure that previously viewed alerts are not constantly re-transmitted for a given patient profile. The clinician is immediately able to determine if the patient they are seeing is potentially part of a larger public health concern and may obtain advice on how to address relevant public health concerns and possible case management. By improving the communication between public health officials and clinicians, the AKR potentially may help improve patient care and provide for more effective and efficient case identification, public health alert management, and disease outbreak control.",
