Here, we report the development of an improved molecular diagnostics tool that utilizes CRISPR/dCas9mediated biosensor that couples a nuclease inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) and single microring resonator biosensor, enables label-free and real-time detection of pathogenic DNA and RNA. We addressed the clinical utility of this CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor in tick-borne illnesses including scrub typhus (ST) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), whose clinical presentations are too similar to be easily differentiated. By using CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor, we achieved single molecule sensitivity for the detection of ST (0.54 aM) and SFTS (0.63 aM); this detection sensitivity is 100 times more sensitive than that of RT-PCR assay. Finally, CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor was able to clearly distinguish between ST and SFTS in serum samples within 20 min. We believe that CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor will be useful for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic tool that is suitable for immediate clinical applications.",

Hence, sequencebased nucleic acid testing has many applications in clinical fields such as diagnosis and epidemiology. However, those approaches are limited in that they are long processing time, high-cost, and relatively less sensitive for clinical use [9] .

            "text": "In vivo genome editing technologies have great clinical application potentials [14, 15] . Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) or transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs)-based editing tools have been introduced for DNA targeting and regulation, however, these proteins need to be individually designed for DNA binding, which remains a hurdle for regulating multiple loci [14, 16] . In contrast, RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) associated Cas9 targets specific genomic loci via a single guide RNA (sgRNA), which contains a 20-bp guide sequence followed by a 3-bp protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and recognizes target DNA through Watson-Crick base pairing [17] . The system uses an endonuclease Cas9 for nucleotide sequence based DNA targeting. Cas9 is guided by the sgRNA that specifically bind to and cleave double-stranded DNA in a site-specific manner [18] [19] [20] [21] . Recently, Cas9 nuclease can be used to enrich and detect the small amounts of tumor fragments in the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or Zika virus [22, 23] . Also, other types of Cas proteins such as Cas12a or Cas13 are used for rapid detection of nucleic acids [24] [25] [26] [27] . In addition to wild-type Cas9 or Cas9 orthologue proteins, catalytically inactivated Cas9 protein (dCas9) has great potential for various biological studies [28, 29] . In contrast to the wild-type Cas9, the nuclease-deficient dCas9 have the ability to bind to DNA using sgRNA without cutting. Hence, dCas9 technology is a widely useful tool for in vivo and in vitro diagnostics [17, [28] [29] [30] .",

The biosensors transduce the presence of target molecules based on binding-induced changes in the refractive index proximal to the waveguide surface [13] . In the case of combination of dCas9 and isothermal based biosensor, dCas9 can recognize the target DNA or cDNA but not cut the sequences of target. Because of the binding property of dCas9, the refractive index is changed based on the binding with target and dCas9 that could be more enhanced the sensitivity than SMR biosensor alone. On the other hand, Cas9 can recognize the target DNA or cDNA and cut the target sequences. Thus, the binding-induced changes are not affected. We demonstrated the clinical usefulness of this technology by using 3 Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus (ST), and 3 bunyavirus, the causative agent of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). ST and SFTS are tick-borne infectious diseases that are common in Eastern Asia, especially in Korea, China, and Japan [28, 29] . Moreover, the clinical presentations of these diseases substantially overlap; therefore, a rapid and highly sensitive detection method is greatly needed. Our method clearly distinguished between ST and SFTS within 20 min from serum samples.",

CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor as a molecular diagnostic tool Fig. 1A shows the design of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor that couples SMR-based isothermal nucleic acid amplification and dCas9 RNP. For simultaneous amplification and detection of nucleic acid, sequence specific primer of target was immobilized to the surface of the SMR biosensor and dCas9 RNP was in reaction chamber with single temperature for isothermal reaction with RPA. For DNA, a primer binds a recombinase enzyme to extend the DNA. For RNA, RT-RPA was used for the formation of complex of a primer and a recombinase enzyme to transcribe cDNA from RNA. The amplified nucleic acid targets were simultaneously detected by monitoring the wavelength shift. During the nucleic acid amplification process with dCas9 RNP on the SMR biosensor, the immobilized primer was hybridized with the target templates; dCas9 RNP, which allows sequence specific binding to the target nucleic acids (nearby the waveguide surface at immobilized forward primer, Supplementary Fig. S1 ), subsequently caused a dramatic increase as a signal enhancer in the proportion of each resonant wavelength. The SMR biosensors transduce the presence of target molecules based on binding-induced changes in the refractive index proximal to the waveguide surface. dCas9 binds to the amplified product on the surface of the sensor and increases the molecular weight of the sensor surface, thereby increasing the detection sensitivity by increasing the refractive index change. Therefore, the CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor detected the pathogenic nucleic acids with high sensitivity within 20 min compared to the SMR alone (Fig. 1A) .",

We observed that Cas9 RNPs induced targeted DNA cleavage and dCas9 RNPs bound target DNA in RPA buffer conditions using an in vitro cleavage assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), respectively ( Fig. 2A, B) . To determine whether dCas9 RNP could enhance the detection sensitivity of the SMR biosensor, we amplified DNA fragments from ST clinical samples; as a result, we observed that the signal was higher with ST + dCas9 RNPs than with ST alone or ST + Cas9 RNPs at all time points (from 5 min to 30 min) (Fig. 3A) . The relative resonant wavelength shift results of the ST with dCas9 RNPs showed that it is possible to clearly separate the positive and negative than ST alone and ST with Cas9 RNPs. In the case of ST with Cas9 RNPs, because of the cutting property of Cas9 RNPs, the result of relative resonant wavelength shift was reduced and looked like a negative. This improvement is due to the specific binding of dCas9 RNPs with the target fragment on the biosensor, and not a non-specific binding effect (Fig. 3B) . Remarkably, dCas9 RNPs improved both detection sensitivity and specificity. We also optimized the concentration of dCas9 RNPs for sensitive and specific detection of pathogenic nucleic acids (Fig. 3C ).",

            "text": "We addressed several features for clinical use of this assay. First, CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor enhances detection sensitivity through triple-targeting (primer, target strand, and dCas9). dCas9 shows higher sensitivity and specificity than the conventional method because it requires accurate target recognition of 20 nt of gRNA (Supplementary Table S2 ). Importantly, the triple-targeting method provides a significant advancement in terms of detection sensitivity from our previous SMR biosensor approach that utilized primer to target strand only [11, 13] . By using triple-targeting, we were able to detect a single copy target, which translates into 10 times higher sensitivity than that of SMR biosensor alone (10 copies) and 100 times more sensitive than that of real-time (RT)-PCR methods (100 copies). Second, the readout system of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor differs from other CRISPR based diagnostic assays (i.e., fluorescence dye) in fundamental ways [24] [25] [26] [27] . SMR biosensor based isothermal nucleic acid amplification assay can be simultaneously amplified and detect the target without labeling. In addition, CRISPR/dCas9 enhanced the refractive index change on the sensor surface. Therefore, the readout of sample using our assay can be carried out within 20 min. Third, the results of false-positive or false-negative are minimized by the use of sgRNA, primer, and dCas9. We have also shown that this assay is able to clearly distinguish the two pathogens in clinical samples. Our data on the clinical sensitivity and specificity highlights the utility and practicality of CRISPR/dCas9-mediated biosensor. Fourth, Gootenberg et al. developed a CRISPR/Cas13a (previously known as C2c2)-based diagnostic assay [24, 25] . Because Cas13a is a programmable RNA-guided ribonuclease, Cas13a-based diagnosis is an RNA-based detection method that exploits the collateral effect of Cas13a. Our complementary approach using CRISPR/dCas9 is a DNA-based detection method that is able to detect nucleic acids during isothermal nucleic acid amplification without in vitro RNA transcription.",
