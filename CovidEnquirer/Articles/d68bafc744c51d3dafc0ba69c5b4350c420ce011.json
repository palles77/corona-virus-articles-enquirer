            "text": "Zoonoses are diseases transmissible from vertebrate animals, other than humans, to people. Mammals, birds, reptiles, and probably amphibians are reservoirs or amplifier hosts for these viral zoonoses. Frequently, these viruses cause little or no overt disease in their nonhuman vertebrate hosts. Some zoonotic viruses have very limited host ranges; others may infect a wide range of vertebrates. Human infection may vary from unapparent to fatal disease. Both new and old viral zoonoses are especially important in emerging and re-emerging virus diseases. Transmission of zoonotic viruses may occur by a variety of routes. They include: 'direct' (rabies) or 'indirect' (hantavirus) contact; 'nosocomial' (arenavirus and filovirus); 'aerosol transmission' (SARS coronavirus); 'vertical' (in utero) (arenaviruses); and 'vector-or arthropod-borne' (yellow fever, YF). Viral zoonotic diseases occur on every continent except, perhaps Antarctica. Some are found around the world, in a variety of ecological settings. Others are found only in very limited ecologic and geographic foci. Although hundreds of viruses are zoonotic, the importance of many of these viruses has not yet been established. Some of the more important viral zoonoses will be discussed briefly.",

Animals can become infected without nervous system disease, develop antibodies, and survive, but play no role in transmission. Classical rabies is found all around the world except in Antarctica, Britain, the Hawaiian Islands, Australia, and New Zealand. Transmission occurs by the bite of an infected animal. Aerosol (droplet) transmission is rare. Dogs and cats are the main reservoirs in tropical developing countries where more than 99% of all human cases occur. In industrialized countries, wild mammals are the main reservoirs and the species involved vary from region to region. The principal species are as follows: in North America, skunks, raccoons, and foxes; in Europe, foxes; and in the Caribbean, mongooses. Bats in all enzootic regions harbor rabies with vampire bats especially important in the Neotropics, where they transmit rabies to cattle, horses, and other domestic animals, and, occasionally, to humans. Rabies virus is classified in the genus Lyssavirus of the family Rhabdoviridae. Genetic relationships between rabies isolates from different species and geographic areas have been established by genomic sequence analysis ( Table 1) .",

There are about 22 different arenaviruses in the Americas, but only four are associated with significant human disease. These pathogenic arenaviruses establish persistent infection in their rodent hosts, and the virus is shed in urine, infecting humans who live in close contact with these contaminated environments. Lassa fever is also transmitted nosocomially in rural hospitals to other people in contact with blood from viremic patients. Control of these diseases is attempted mainly by reduction of rodent populations. A live, attenuated vaccine has been developed for Argentine hemorrhagic fever, and a vaccinia-vectored vaccine has been developed for Lassa fever.

            "text": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) viruses are made up of a closely related complex of subtypes with several varieties, which have differing epidemiology, geographic distributions, and disease importance. The epizootic/ epidemic (VEE, IAB, and IC) virus variants are of greatest concern. In equine animals, the virus causes acute encephalitis, and case fatality may approach 80%. Survivors may have serious neurological deficits. Although the case-fatality rate in humans is low (less than 1%), the large numbers of acutely infected people that occur during an epidemic may completely overwhelm the local healthcare system. VEE, IAB, and IC viruses are maintained in northern South America, where they have periodically swept through Venezuela and Colombia in epidemic waves, with occasional extensions into Ecuador and massively through Central America into Mexico and South Texas. Epidemic spread depends on the availability of susceptible equine populations (the amplifying host) and abundant mosquito vectors of several species. The interepidemic maintenance systems remain undefined. There is evidence that the epizootic strains may arise by mutation of subtype ID enzootic virus. The enzootic strains are maintained in limited foci involving rodents and Culex (Melanconion) spp. mosquitoes from Florida to Argentina. With the exception of subtype IE, which has caused epizootics in horses in Mexico, these enzootic virus strains do not cause disease in equine animals, but can cause acute febrile illness in humans. The VEE complex viruses are in the genus Alphavirus of the Togaviridae. There is an effective live, attenuated vaccine for both human and equine use. Because the maintenance of equine herd immunity is costly, most animal health agencies do not carry out ongoing, intensive vaccination campaigns. Thus, the risk of reoccurrence of explosive outbreaks remains. Eastern (EEE) and western (WEE) equine encephalitis viruses occur in epidemic form in North America, but have also been found in Central and South America. Generally, EEE is maintained in eastern North America but has caused scattered epizootics and cases in the Caribbean, and in Central and South America. EEE virus can be divided into a North American-Caribbean clade, an Amazon Basin clade, and a Trinidad, Venezuela, Guyana, Ecuador, and Argentina clade. During the past several years, there have been modest increases in several US states in the number of reported human cases of EEE. In North America, WEE occurs in western and prairie states and provinces and along the west coast. WEE has caused sporadic cases of encephalitis in equine animals, but not humans, in Argentina and Uruguay. Both involve wild birds and mosquito vectors, with spillover into equine population and humans, causing clinical encephalitis and death. Central nervous sequelae may occur among survivors. Effective vaccines are available commercially for equine animals, and experimental vaccines are used for laboratory personnel. Effective mosquito abatement to control vector populations has been carried out in the West for many years. Insecticide application is used for vector control in epidemic situations.",

It is endemic in the Upper Midwest, but occasional cases occur elsewhere. Although fatality is uncommon, the disease is severe enough to cause prolonged hospitalization.

A second, and more severe, outbreak occurred in Uige Province of Angola from 2004 to 2005, when 329 of 374 infected people died (case-fatality rate of 88%). These viruses produce hemorrhagic shock syndrome and visceral organ necrosis, and have the highest case-fatality rate (30-90%) of the hemorrhagic fevers. These viruses, with their bizarre filamentous, pleomorphic morphology, belong to the family Filoviridae. They are presumed to be zoonotic, but their hosts in nature and mechanisms of transmission in the field have not been determined. Most of the Makokou, Gabon patients had very recently butchered chimpanzees. A variant of Ebola virus has been isolated from chimpanzees from C\u00f4te D'Ivoire, but since wild primates suffer severe disease, they are unlikely to be maintenance reservoirs. Nosocomial transmission of Marburg and Ebola viruses has occurred frequently; a high level of patient isolation and biosafety containment are essential to avoid hospitaland laboratory-acquired infection. Serologic diagnosis is accomplished by means of indirect immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, with antigen specificity confirmed by western blot. No vaccines or control measures are available.",

Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is endemic in rodents in West and Central Africa, with the occurrence of sporadic human cases. The case-fatality rate in humans appears to be higher in Central Africa than in West Africa, raising questions about possible difference in virulence in these two large geographic areas. The largest epidemic of human monkeypox ever documented occurred in the Katako-Kombe area of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) in 1996-97, with over 500 people becoming ill and five deaths. Rodent-to-human transmission occurred, as did subsequent secondary human-tohuman spread. Vaccinia is protective against infection, but its use has been discontinued with the eradication of smallpox. In 2003, monkeypox emerged for the first time in the Western Hemisphere and caused an outbreak in the United States (Midwestern states) affecting 37 people exposed to ill prairie dogs purchased from pet stores. The virus entered the US upon the importation of exotic rodents from Ghana (West Africa).

New subtypes emerge when human virus captures genes from animal influenza viruses via reassortment; an event that can occur when both virus types simultaneously infect a host (antigenic shift). The threat imposed by influenza virus has been further elevated with the recent introductions of avian influenza viruses into the human population. Avian influenza viruses were initially considered nonpathogenic for humans. However, this perception has changed since 1997, when 18 Hong Kong residents were infected by an avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype that resulted in six deaths. Over the next few years, several other cases of direct avian-to-human transmission were reported, including the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses in several Asian, African, and European countries. Migratory waterfowl -most notably wild ducks -are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses, and these birds are also the most resistant to infection. Domestic poultry, including chickens and turkeys, are particularly susceptible to epidemics of rapidly fatal influenza. Direct or indirect contact of domestic flocks with wild migratory waterfowl has been implicated as a frequent cause of epidemics. Live bird markets have also played an important role in the spread of epidemics. Viruses of low pathogenicity can, after circulation for sometimes short periods in a poultry population, mutate into highly pathogenic viruses. Quarantine of infected farms and destruction of infected or potentially exposed flocks are standard control measures aimed at preventing spread to other farms and eventual establishment of the virus in a country's poultry population.",

Insecticide application has become more problematic because both vectors themselves, as well as public opinion, have become more resistant to their use.

Some zoonotic viruses occur worldwide, in a variety of ecological settings. Others are found only in limited ecologic and geographic foci. Important worldwide zoonotic viruses include rabies, hantaviruses, arenaviruses, yellow fever virus, chikungunya virus, Sindbis virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, and the sandfly fever viruses. In the Americas, common zoonotic viruses include the encephalitis viruses, Colorado tick fever virus, vesicular stomatitis, and others. ",
