Although MERS-CoV can be cultured and antibody detection methods available, laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections is mainly achieved by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). 4 Recently, we have described the development of a monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based capture ELISA for MERS-CoV N protein (NP) detection and its use in field study for dromedaries. 5, 6 However, both real-time qRT-PCR and NP capture ELISA take at least several hours to complete and require specific equipments in a clinical laboratory. In this study, we developed a MAb-based rapid NP detection assay for MERS.",

Production and selection of specific MAbs against the MERS-CoV NP was performed as described previously. 6 The rapid MERS-CoV NP detection assay, in the format of a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), was developed using a similar approach as described previously, 7 using LFIA test strip (Millipore) and two highly specific MAbs against the MERS-CoV rNP (MD3E9 for coating and MD8B6 for conjugating). Testing is carried out by mixing 380 ml of each sample with 20 ml lysis buffer for 10 s at room temperature. Then, 80 ml of the pre-treated sample was transferred into the sample well of the test card slowly at room temperature. Results are read visually in 30 min. Result is considered negative when the control line is positive but the test line negative, and considered positive when both the control and test lines are positive (Fig. 1 ). If the control line is negative, the test is considered invalid. Initial assessment of the detection limit was performed using a human nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) spiked with various concentrations of MERS-CoV. First round of evaluation was performed using 56 human NPAs positive for various respiratory viruses and 10 human NPAs spiked with 10 5.2 TCID 50 /ml MERS-CoV. All human NPAs were collected from the clinical microbiology laboratory in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Second round of evaluation was performed using 81 dromedary nasal swabs/tonsils collected during necropsies at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai. These dromedary respiratory samples were tested by real-time qRT-PCR and the rapid MERS-CoV assay. All tests were performed in duplicate.",

However, its turn-around-time is about 4 h and the test requires expensive equipment, stringent laboratory set-up and personal attention to prevent cross contamination. As for the antigen capture ELISA that we developed recently, although the main equipments involved are less expensive ELISA plate washer and reader, it still requires technical expertise and 3 h to finish the test. 6 However, for the rapid MERS-CoV assay developed in the present study, it is extremely simple to perform by any health care worker with minimal training and can be finished in 30 min. Furthermore, the test does not require any specific equipment and the samples need only minimal preparation and pretreatment. In addition to being user-friendly and rapid, the test is highly specific. All human NPAs positive for other respiratory viruses, including all the four human CoVs, or dromedary nasal swabs/tonsils negative for MERS-CoV showed negative results using the rapid MERS-CoV test. In addition, results were also negative for dromedary respiratory/fecal samples spiked with our recently sequenced lineage A betacoronavirus found in dromedaries 8 (data not shown). All these confirm that this rapid MERS-CoV test has a very high specificity.",

Our results showed that the detection limit of this rapid MERS-CoV test is around 10 3.7 e10 4.2 TCID 50 /ml of MERS-CoV, which is about 25e100 times less sensitive than the antigen capture ELISA with detection limit of about 10 2.3 . A moderately high sensitivity of 81% was confirmed using dromedary respiratory samples positive for MERS-CoV by real-time qRT-PCR. It is quite well-known that similar rapid tests for antigen detection in other viruses are less sensitive than ELISA or other antigen detection methods. 9 This is because a higher antigen load is required to for these rapid tests to produce a band visible to the naked eye. Since its sensitivity is just moderately high, this rapid MERS-CoV test can be used for initial rapid screening for suspected case of MERS. If the result is positive, the patient can be isolated with other cases of MERS; but if the result is negative, the patient should be isolated in single room and further tests such as real-time qRT-PCR or antigen capture ELISA should be performed.
