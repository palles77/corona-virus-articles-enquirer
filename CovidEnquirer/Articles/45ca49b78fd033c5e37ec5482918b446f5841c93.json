            "text": "The antigenic structure of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus E2 glycoprotein has been defined at three levels: antigenic sites, antigenic subsites and epitopes. Four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) were defined by competitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) selected from 9 fusions. About 20% (197) of the hybridomas specific for TGE virus produced neutralizing MAbs specific for site A, which was one of the antigenically dominant determinants. Site A was differentiated in three antigenic subsites: a, b and c, by characterization of 11 MAb resistant (mar) mutants, that were defined by 8, 3, and 3 MAbs, respectively. These subsites were further subdivided in epitopes. A total of 11 epitopes were defined in E2 glycoprotein, eight of which were critical for virus neutralization. Neutralizing MAbs were obtained only when native virus was used to immunize mice, although to produce hybridomas mice immunizations were made with antigen in the native, denatured, or mixtures of native and denatured form. All neutralizing MAbs reacted to conformational epitopes. The antigenic structure of the EZglycoprotein has been defined with murine MAbs, but the antigenic sites were relevant in the swine, the natural host of the virus, because porcine sera reacted against these sites. MAbs specific for TGE virus site C reacted to non-immune porcine sera. This reactivity was not directed against porcine immunoglobulins. These results indicated that TGE virus contains epitope(s) also present in some non-immunoglobulin component of porcine serum.",

Then ST cell monolayers growing in petri dishes were inoculated with 0.2 ml portions of lo-fold dilutions of the virus-MAb mixtures and incubated for 1 h at 37 o C, before adding an agar overlay containing 0.2 volumes of the corresponding hybridoma supernatant per dish (diameter 35 mm; Costar). At 2 days after infection, virus from plaques were collected, and the selection procedure was carried out two more times. The mar mutants isolated were neutralized less than 100.5-fold by the homologous MAbs, whereas these neutralized the original virus more than 104.8 times. The frequency of the mar mutants was defined as the inverse of the number of PFU of virus neutralized by a MAb per each PFU resistant to the neutralization by this MAb.",

No. 162-0115, Bio-Rad Laboratories). Basically, the procedure of Hawkes et al. (1982) was followed. Briefly, native or denatured purified TGE virus (0.5 pg per well) was bound to nitrocellulose paper prewashed for 30 min with PBS buffer. Virus was denatured by incubation in boiling water for 10 min with 0.5% SDS in PBS. After denaturation the virus was diluted lo-fold in PBS and bound to nitrocellulose paper by incubating 10 ~1 samples for 1 h at room temperature. After filtration by vacuum, 250 ~1 of blocking solution (3% BSA in PBS) per well were added, incubated for 0.5 h and filtered. Then, one hundred-fold dilution of the mouse serum in PBS containing 0.1% BSA or undiluted hybridoma supematant was added, and the incubation continued overnight at 4 o C. The wells were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 using vacuum, the nitrocellulose membrane was removed from the microfiltration apparatus and incubated 0.5 h at room temperature in the presence of 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (Molico, Nestle) in PBS. Then, a 103-fold dilution of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins (heavy and light chains) (Cappel Laboratories) in PBS supplemented with 1% BSA was added and incubated for 1 h. The filters were washed, color development solution (3 mg of 4-chloro-1-naphthol per ml of methanol and five vol of 0.02% H,O, in PBS) (Hawkes et al., 1982) was added and the incubation continued until optimum staining was obtained.",

All neutralizing MAbs were specific for the E2 glycoprotein and recognized epitopes sensitive to denaturation with SDS plus 2-ME. In order to induce E2 specific neutralizing MAbs which would be able to recognize antigenic determinants representative of the major immunodominant sites and resistant to denaturation, fusions 7, 8 and 9 were performed using cells from mice immunized with native virus alone (fusion 7) or with native and denatured virus (fusions 8 and 9).

The study was performed with each possible pair of MAbs in both directions. Binding inhibition curves, as those shown in Fig. 1 , were obtained. All MAbs inhibited the binding of the homologous '251-labelled ones by more than 90%. Different degrees of competition, that are illustrated for representative MAbs, were obtained: (i) only one MAb blocked the binding completely (Fig. 1,A) or partially (Figure 1,D) . The results of bidirectional competitive RIA were processed and all MAbs that inhibited the binding more than 70% were assigned to the same antigenic site. Figure 2 shows a summary of these results. Four antigenic sites (named A, B, C and D) could be differentiated. These sites were defined by 16, 2, 2, and 1 MAb, respectively. Interestingly, all neutralizing MAbs mapped at site A. Conversely, all MAbs against site A were neutralizing. We extended this study to the 181 neutralizing MAbs selected in fusions 7, 8 and 9.

Based on this data, and on the percentage of wells with hybridoma growth (70%), we considered for statistical conclusions, that we are dealing with monoclonal reagents. Nevertheless, 68 hybridomas (48 from the first 6 fusions, and 20 from fusions 7, 8, and 9) were cloned at least three times. MAbs representative of the antigenically dominant sites were obtained. We introduced the characterization of mar mutants to subdivide the critical antigenic site in smaller antigenic areas that were defined as antigenic subsites, which most probably represented domains of the virus surface physically differentiable.",

These MAbs were secreted by a large proportion (around 20%) of the 1,015 positive hybridomas analyzed (as in our cloning conditions each well contained, statistically, around one hybridoma per well). This result suggests that the critical site A is one of the antigenically dominants, in agreement with our previous results (Enjuanes et al., 1987) . Delmas et al. (1986) also have identified an immunodominant site in TGE virus neutralization. We studied the neutralization of TGE virus (PUR 54 strain) by a MAb induced with the Miller strain of this virus (provided by R. Woods and R. Wesley). This MAb, which neutralized reversibly the PUR 54 strain of TGE virus (probably because of its low avidity) did not inhibit'the binding of MAbs representative of antigenic sites A, B, C or D (I. Correa, R. Woods, R. Wesley, and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results). These data indicated that either TGE virus has minor critical epitopes distinct from site A, or that this MAb reacted also to the critical site A, but due to its low avidity did not inhibit the binding of site A representative MAbs.",

The number of epitopes (11) defined on the E2 glycoprotein with a relative molecular weight of 200000 is in the order of the numbers defined in well characterized viruses (one epitope for each fragment with a relative molecular weight of 12000) (Jackson et al., 1982; Niman and Elder, 1982; Stone and Nowinski, 1980) . The epitopes defined with murine MAbs in the E2 glycoprotein were relevant for the natural host, as porcine sera from infected or immunized swine reacted to the four antigenic sites defined by competitive RIA with the MAbs. The MAbs reacting to antigenic site C also reacted to an undetermined non-immunoglobulin component of swine sera. Thus TGE virus infection could induce an autoimmune response, that could produce an immunocomplex disease in chronically infected animals (Oldstone, 1984) .",
