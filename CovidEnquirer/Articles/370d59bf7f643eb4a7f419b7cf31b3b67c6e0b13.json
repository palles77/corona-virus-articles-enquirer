Our objective was to develop a cell culture system to grow HRV-C. Epithelial cells from human sinuses (HSEC) were differentiated at air-liquid interface (ALI). Differentiated cultures supported 1-2 logs growth of HRV-C15 as detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Two distinguishing features of HRVs are acid lability and optimal growth at 33-34 1C. We used this system to show that HRV-C15 is neutralized by low pH (4.5). In contrast to most HRV types, replication of HRV-C15 and HRV-C41 was similar at 34 and 37 1C. The HSEC ALI provides a useful tool for quantitative studies of HRV-C replication. The ability of HRV-C to grow equally well at 34 1C and 37 1C may contribute to the propensity for HRV-C to cause lower airway illnesses in infants and children with asthma.",

HRV have a tremendous diversity and 160 subtypes have been recognized so far. Historically, HRV were classified into 100 serotypes based on cross-reactivity in neutralization tests (Hamparian et al., 1987) . These serotypes were categorized in a variety of ways such as receptor usage into major or minor group (Uncapher et al., 1991) , or according to the sensitivity to antiviral agents into group A or B (Andries et al., 1990) . Based on the full-length or partial (VP2/VP4 and VP1) coding sequences they were initially classified into A and B genotypes (Ledford et al., 2004; Savolainen et al., 2002) . With the use of molecular diagnostic techniques a novel group was discovered in 2006 (Arden et al., 2006) and was designated C species. HRV-C are not emerging viruses but had been circulating unnoticed due to the inability to culture them. Sequencing of the complete genomes of A, B and available C types confirmed their assignment into three distinct phylogenetic taxa (Palmenberg et al., 2009) .",

In addition, the number of cells per well is uniform, and the cultures consist almost entirely of epithelial cells which provides a more uniform substrate for viral replication.

One limitation of our studies is that viral titer is inferred from the quantity of viral RNA and not by the progeny virus particles produced since plaque assays for HRV-C strains await development. Previous studies have demonstrated excellent correlation between HRV measured by plaque assay and by qPCR (Mosser et al., 2005) . Addition of retinoic acid and steroids in the ALI medium is essential for development and differentiation of the HSEC epithelium.

At 90% confluence, the cells were dissociated with trypsin and seeded either as monolayer cultures or for differentiation at ALI. The cells obtained at P-0 and P-1 were frozen in liquid nitrogen for future use. For monolayers, cells were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1 \u00c2 10 5 cells/ml. For differentiated cultures, cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 \u00c2 10 5 cells/cm 2 in BEGM (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) onto the apical surface of 1.13 cm 2 Transwell polycarbonate inserts (Costar 0.4 mm pore size, 10 mm membrane thickness; Corning Inc., Corning, NY) coated with human placental collagen Type VI (Sigma-Aldrich, St.Louis, MO) in a 12-well plate. The cells were fed basally with BEGM and incubated at 37 1C for first 24 h. Media was removed from the apical surface and the basal medium was changed to BEGM and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) in a 1:1 ratio supplemented with the following additives: insulin, 2.5 mg/ml; transferrin, 5 mg/ml; recombinant epithelial growth factor, 0.25 ng/ml; hydrocortisone, 0.25 mg/ml; epinephrine, 0.25 mg/ml; triiodothyronine, 3.25 ng/ml; retinoic acid, 0.05 ng/ml; bovine pituitary extract, 1% (v/v); gentamycin, 50 mg/ml (''ALI'' medium) (Gray et al., 1996) . The medium was replaced daily for the first seven days and every other day thereafter. The cultures were allowed to mature for at least 21 days until ciliary movement was visualized. The cultures exhibited trans-epithelial resistance (TER) values from 800-1200 O/cm 2 at 21 days consistent with formation of tight junctions. The cultures on average contained 1 \u00c2 10 6 cells/well at 30 days of age and formed a pseudo-stratified epithelium (Fig. 1) . Tissues from a total of 13 donors were tested, and all except one differentiated in the ALI conditions.",
