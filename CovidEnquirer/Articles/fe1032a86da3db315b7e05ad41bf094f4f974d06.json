A control real-time RT-PCR was undertaken on GAPDH mRNA (a human housekeeping gene) was carried out to standardise the non-homogeneous respiratory samples. The real-time RT-PCR method was one log more sensitive for the detection of RSV according to the endpoint dilution technique than the culture method or a conventional qualitative RT-PCRhybridization-EIA. No cross-reactivity was observed with any of the viruses that could be found in the respiratory tract. RSV and GAPDH were quantified in nasal aspirates from 75 children hospitalised for acute respiratory tract disease: 31 (41.3%) were positive according to the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), 34 (45.3%) were culture-positive and 42 (56%) were positive according to our real-time RT-PCR method. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the real-time RT-PCR were 100, 90, 92, 100%, respectively. The samples found to be positive for RSV were classified according to the severity of the disease. The mean number of RSV RNA copies was higher in the severe disease group than in the non-severe group 4.05 )/10 7 vs 9.1)/10 6 (P 0/0.055). However, the mean ratio of RSV RNA copies to GAPDH mRNA copies was 42.8 in the severe group, and 22.2 in non-severe group (P0/NS). #",

It is the most frequently isolated agent from hospitalised infants (Freymuth et al., 1987) .

The aim of our study was to quantify RSV genomic RNA by use of real-time PCR using a Light-Cycler instrument (Wittwer et al., 1997) . As for other Paramyxoviridae , RSV particles are mostly cell-associated in infected tissues. As nasal aspirates are non-homogeneous, a method is suggested for the standardisation of samples based on the quantitation of the mRNA of a housekeeping gene, GAPDH (which is probably expressed at a constant rate). This study describes two real-time PCR techniques designed to quantify RSV genomic RNA and GAPDH mRNA. These methods were then used to assess the RSV loads in respiratory specimens from children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract disease.",

The RNA concentration was estimated by spectrophotometry and the average of four measurements was used. Aliquots were stored at (/70 8C. Once an aliquot had been thawed it was never refrozen. For each quantification, two standard aliquots were subjected to serial 10fold dilutions in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate)-treated water.

To estimate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the real-time RT-PCR assay for RSV a gold standard was required for RSV detection. Theoretically, the gold standard is the isolation in cell culture. To overcome the problem associated with the relative insensitivity of the culture method with clinical specimens (particularly due to bacterial contamination) we considered samples to be positive if they were found to be positive by at least two of the three technique. Thus 39 (52%) true-positives were obtained. A specimen that was found to be positive by only one technique was considered to be a false-positive. There were eight false positive results: two cases with IFA, three cases with the culture method and three cases with real-time RT-PCR assay for RSV. The latter three cases were probably true-positives because the real-time RT-PCR assay was the most sensitive method tested. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the three techniques were calculated (Table 4) . On clinical specimens, the real-time RT-PCR was the most sensitive (100%), followed by the culture method (88%) and IFA (82%). The number of RSV RNA copies was calculated and of GAPDH mRNA copies in the 36 specimens where the viral load could be calculated (Fig. 1) . The number of RSV RNA copies ranged from 4.6 to 8.4 log with a mean of 6.8 log and an SD of 0.99 log. The analysis of the GAPDH mRNA copies confirmed that the number of cells in nasal aspirates differed from one sample to another, ranging from 4.3 to 6.7 log with a mean of 5.6 log and an SD of 0.63 log (Fig. 1A) . As RSV particles are cell-associated in cultures and in clinical samples and as the number of copies of the housekeeping gene (GAPDH) is proportional to the number of cells in the sample, these results can be expressed as the ratio of the number of copies of RSV RNA to the number of copies of GAPDH mRNA. This allows the results obtained from the different nasal aspirates to be compared with each other, and ensures that the number of cells in each nasal sample (and thus the quality of the sampling) is not an interfering factor. Most of the specimens had comparable and low ratios of below 20 (mean ratio: 32.5), and 16 had a ratio indicating a rather high RSV RNA level.",

The two samples found to be positive only by the IFA method are likely to be false-positives. Three samples were positive only in one of the two types of cell culture (MRC5 or A-549). The presence of some inhibitors of the RT or PCR steps can be ruled out as GAPDH mRNA was amplified in these samples. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the cell cultures that were inoculated in microplates were cross contaminated. Three nasal aspirates were only found to be positive by real-time RT-PCR (even after checking on another extract). As this technique is the most sensitive of the three tested, and as these three samples had a very low viral load, it is likely that they are actually true-positives, and that conventional techniques were not sensitive enough to detect such low levels of virus in these cases.",

In this paper, we have shown that quantitative real-time RT-PCR is more sensitive than qualitative RT-PCR in infected cell cultures, and than isolation of respiratory samples in cell culture, identifying 6% more cases as being RSVpositive. However, real-time RT-PCR can also be used as a qualitative method. In this application it has many advantages over the conventional qualitative RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR is faster and cheaper taking just 45 min on the LightCycler apparatus, and including the detection of the amplification product. It is also a closed system, which prevents cross contamination. We attempted to estimate the detection limit of the real-time RT-PCR. The analytical sensitivity of the real-time RT-PCR was 10 3 RSV RNA copies/ml in vitro. However, this value is not absolute as it was obtained from a standard that was quantified by measuring absorbency at 260 nm which is not very accurate. However, as RSV RNA in respiratory samples was always quantitated using the same standard, the results are comparable and reliable.",

In other words, if the quantitative results are standardised according to the number of cells in the sample, thus accounting for the quality of the sampling, the severity of the disease does not appear to be linked to the RSV load. The mean RSV/GAPDH ratio tended to be higher in cases of severe bronchiolitis, which makes it necessary to undertake further investigations to confirm whether there is indeed a link between the severity of RSV infection and the quantity of virus in nasal aspirates. Nevertheless, factors other than intensive viral replication are likely to play a role in the severity of the bronchiolitis. These factors can include inflammatory responses and the genetic susceptibility of the patients.
