Despite the almost 100 plant-derived compounds that are in clinical trials, few target HIV-1 infection. In this study, we discovered that Sanguisorba officinalis extract (SOE) has anti-HIV-1 properties. Using a cell-based assay and single-cycle luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with envelopes from HIV-1 or control viruses, we found that SOE exhibited significant inhibitory ability against both CCR5 and CXCR4 tropic HIV-1 (ADA and HXB2), with respective IC 50 values of 1.91 AE 0.16 mg/mL and 3.70 AE 0.53 mg/mL. SOE also inhibited simian immunodeficiency virus infection but failed to block vesicular stomatitis virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and influenza H5N1 pseudoviruses. Furthermore, we showed that SOE had no effect on postentry events of HIV-1 replication. Because SOE pretreatment with the virus but not with cell lines expressing viral receptors showed the maximal inhibitory activity, we can state that SOE probably blocks entry by acting on the viral envelope directly. In addition, SOE was able to inhibit reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistant viruses (K103N, Y188L, and K103N/Y188L/G190A) and a protease inhibitor resistant strain (PI-2840). Our findings demonstrate SOE as a novel and specific entry inhibitor, which sheds light on the discovery of anti-HIV-1 drugs from traditional herbal medicines.",

TCM was developed in China as a personalized medical practice based on a tradition of more than 5000 years. As a result, thousands of plants have been used as herbal medicines for treating different types of diseases. For example, one of the most famous drugs, artemisinin, was originally extracted from the plant Artemisia annua and is now a standard treatment worldwide for Plasmodium falciparum malaria [1] . During the past decade, the use of TCM has increased globally as one of the mainstreams of complementary and alternative medicine. It also serves as a rich resource for new drug development.",

This situation continues today because HAART is still not readily accessible or affordable especially in rural areas, where the majority of patients reside. Even in the era of HAART, HIVinfected people who used herbal therapy at a high rate sought more frequent visits to TCM providers and reported helpful improvement with the treatment [2, 3] . In most cases, however, it remains unknown whether the herbs used had any anti-HIV activities, and therefore it is unknown if they were regarded as enhancing patients' immune function, as the treatment of HIV-related symptoms, or as the management of HAART-related side effects [4] . In recent years, studies have demonstrated that evidence-based research on compounds extracted from herbal plants can elucidate their biochemical activity, revealing antitumor activity in some cases and anti-HIV activity in others [5e9] . The study of some herbal compounds has been moved forward into clinical trials [6, 7, 10] . Prior to this study, however, it was unclear if Sanguisorba officinalis had any anti-HIV activity.",

We found that SOE inhibited both ADA and HXB2 pseudovirus infection to a similar degree as T-20, which blocks HIV-1 fusion (Fig. 2B) .

This blockade is HIV-1 specific because SOE does not exhibit any activities against HIV-Luc\u00fe viruses pseudotyped with envelopes of VSV, SARS-CoV, and influenza. Interestingly, SOE acts directly on HIV-1 instead of cellular receptors or coreceptors. It also exhibits potency against replication competent HIV-1 strains resistant to specific drugs targeting protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) activities. Our findings therefore provide scientific evidence for the potential use of SOE in the prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection and the search for small molecular compounds as specific entry inhibitors. Stopping HIV-1 from entering target cells is a critical strategy for both prevention and treatment [20, 21] . Until now, there have been only two drugs in this category approved by the FDA for clinical use in the market: MVC and T-20. MVC binds to the host CCR5 coreceptor to prevent binding with gp120, whereas T-20 interacts with gp41 to interrupt membrane fusion between HIV-1 and the host target cell plasma membrane. T-20 is part of the repertoire of antiretroviral drugs that have been used in combination therapy to treat HIV-1 infection [22] . Although effective, T-20 has to be administrated by injection, whereas MVC requires the screening of patients to exclude strains of CXCR4-tropism. It is therefore useful to identify new types of HIV-1 entry inhibitors. To this end, it is of great interest to discover that SOE ",

It has previously been shown that despite a significant level of sequence diversity, HIV-1 and SIV share a series of events during virus entry including binding of gp120 to CD4 and chemokine coreceptor, and fusion between viral and cellular membranes [20,23e25] . SOE probably acts upon a highly conserved element of HIV-1 and SIV envelope glycoproteins, an issue that still requires future investigation [23,24,26e28] . Because SIVmac1A11 enters target cells in a CD4-independent way [16] , SOE probably inhibits virus entry through other mechanisms rather than by blocking the CD4 binding site directly. Critically, the proven anti-HIV-1 specificity, together with the lack of antiviral effects against VSV, SARS-CoV, and influenza, also rule out the possibility that SOE simply inactivates the HIV-1 virus by acting on viral lipids like a disinfectant. In support of our findings, several small molecules isolated from plants have been reported to have some moderate inhibitory ability against HIV-1 entry. For example, polyphenols found in green tea probably interrupt membrane fusion between HIV-1 and the host cell plasma membrane [29] . Further investigations, are necessary to reveal the mode of SOE action, which may lead to the identification of a new drug targeting the HIV-1 envelope.",

This blockade is HIV-1-specific because SOE does not exhibit any activities against HIV-Luc\u00fe viruses pseudotyped with envelopes of VSV, SARS-CoV, and influenza. Interestingly, SOE acts directly on HIV-1 instead of cellular receptors or coreceptors. It also exhibits potency against replication-competent HIV-1 strains resistant to specific drugs targeting protease and RT activities. Our findings therefore provide evidence for the potential use of SOE in the prevention and treatment of HIV-1 infection, as well as in the search for small molecular compounds as specific entry inhibitors.",
