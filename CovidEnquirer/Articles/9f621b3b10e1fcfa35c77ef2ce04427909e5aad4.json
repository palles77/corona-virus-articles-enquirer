Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, adults with communityonset monomicrobial bacteremia during the 6-year period were enrolled. Clinical information was retrieved from medical records, using a predetermined case record form. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the disk diffusion method, based on performance standards of the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute in 2016. A propensity-score-matched analysis was performed to control for the baseline characteristics at bacteremia onset between the Gram-positive and Gram-negative groups. The propensity score was calculated by the independent predictors of 28-day crude mortality recognized by a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: The total 2,053 adults (Gram-positive, 566 patients and Gram-negative, 1,487) presenting with community-onset monomicrobial bacteremia between the six-year period were recruited. Bacteremia severity (a Pitt bacteremia score) at onset and initial manifestation was different between two groups. On the basis of seven independent predictors of 28-day mortality recognized by the multivariate regression.566 of the 1,487 patients in the Gramnegative group were matched to 566 patients in the Gram-positive group with the closest propensity scores. After appropriate propensity-score matching, no significant differences were observed in baseline characteristics and patient outcomes between the two groups, in terms of age, bacteremia severity, major comorbidities, comorbidity severity, and 28-day mortality.",

Results: We isolated 455 (20.5%, isolation rate) in 2012, 669 (31.4%) in 2013, 655 (30.8%) in 2014, 392 (25.7%) in 2015, 359 (22.0%) in 2016. Among the isolated bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus (740, 29.2%) was the most frequently identified pathogen followed by pathogenic Escherichia coli (646, 25.5%) Salmonella species (506, 20.0%), Bacillus cereus (223, 808%), Clostridium perfringens (219, 8.7%), Campylobacter species (188, 7.4%), Yersinia enterocolitica (8, 0.3%). Pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella species and Campylobacter species showed similar seasonality, showing a surge in the infection rate during the summer months. S. aureus, C. perfringens and B. cereus had no seasonal differences, while prevalence of C. perfringens was high particularly in 2013 and 2014. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of isolated pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella species showed relatively high resistance to ampicillin (55.1%, 39.8%, respectively) and tetracycline (41.3%, 30.3%, respectively), while only 1 of Salmonella species showed resistance to imipenem. Conclusion: This study was based on the use of systematic surveillance of diarrheal patients, providing the geographic trend of bacterial pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibilities.

Guo 1 , W. Yu 1 , B. Zheng 1 , Y. Xiao 1 *. 1 Background: Acinetobacter baumannii has gained significant attention because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains associated with outbreaks of hospital infections. It has been reported that the majority of such isolates belongs to two major global clones, GC1 and GC2, especially GC2 in Asia. But almost all the research focused on antibiotic resistance and epidemiology of these domain clones, little is known about the strategies this bacterium uses for pathogenesis. We used comparative genomics method to compare the genomic difference between blood and sputum A. baumannii isolates belonging to GC2. Methods: WGS was performed on 90 A. baumannii isolates from 45 individuals in a Chinese hospital, with one spit sample and one blood sample from the same patient. Core genome SNP were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of sequenced isolates, and the withinpatient SNP differences for every individual between bloodstream and sputum isolate was identified, at the same time, we recognized the genetic location of these SNPs and the common features of bloodstream infection isolates. Results: We observed 29% individuals with more than 300 pairwise SNPs, also had different ST types in blood-spit isolates, ST195 was the major ST type in blood isolates, but the ratio of ST195 in spit isolates was very low. We detected some candidant genes, such as capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide function related genes, had point mutations in blood isolates, which may be associated with bloodstream infections. Conclusions: Using WGS, we observed potential genes that are critical for the ability of this pathogen to cause bloodstream infections, this study lays the foundation for future research on A. baumannii genes that can be targeted to develop novel therapeutics against this human pathogen.",

Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that has rapidly acquired resistance in the past two decades. Advances in genome sequencing technology have provided a platform for the search of a panacea, resulting in a plethora of A. baumannii genome sequences in the databases. One of the interesting features of A. baumannii genomes is the presence of small plasmids (of around 10 kb or less), some of which encode antibiotic resistance genes. These plasmids tend to be overlooked in genomic analyses of A. baumannii that mainly focuses on larger conjugative plasmids and chromosomal features. Here, we aim to provide detailed analysis of the pRAY-type of small plasmids found in various Acinetobacter genomes and its possible role in the transmission of drug resistance. First isolated in South Africa from A. baumannii SUN, the pRAY plasmid confers resistance to aminoglycosides via the aadB gene. Subsequently, various pRAY derivatives ranging in size from \u223c4-8 kb were found in other strains worldwide, most of which also harboured the aadB gene. Intriguingly, there were no potential replication initiation protein encoded within pRAY or its derivatives, suggesting that its replication may mirror that of the enterobacterial ColE1 plasmids that utilize the host RNA polymerase for its replication initiation. Another feature of this group of plasmids is the presence of mobA and mobC genes along with a putative origin of transfer (oriT), inferring the potential transmissibility of these plasmids. The discovery of a 4.1 kb plasmid, pALWED1.8 from a permafrost A. lwoffii isolate containing the oriT-mobC-mobA region plus an aadA7 aminoglycoside-resistance gene indicated that the oriT-mobC-mobA region is likely the backbone and common ancestor for this group of plasmids. This common ancestor would have acquired various other genes and spread to other Acinetobacter species throughout its evolutionary history.",

This study aimed to determine the usefulness of rapid procalcitonin (PCT) in early detection of bacterial sepsis and its prognostic value. There were 132 patients recruited from intensive care unit and medical wards of clinical training centre from June to December 2016. This immunoassay uses a principle of immunochromatography and performed on day 1 and 5 of admission. Eighty microliter of whole blood was run in parallel to the negative and positive control. The PCT value will be obtained within 15 minutes and matched with the risk category of bacterial sepsis based on the manufacturer's recommendation including extremely high risk, high risk, moderate and low risk that has PCT value of >10ng/ml, 2 to 10ng/ml, 0.5 to < 2ng/ml, and < 0.5ng/ml respectively. Of 132 patients, 33 were excluded due to dengue, and remaining 97 were clinically diagnosed as having bacterial infection. Of 97 patients, 25.7% (n = 25) had extremely high risk of developing sepsis. While 12.4% (n = 12), 16.5% (n = 16) and 45.4% (n = 44) of patients had high, moderate and low risk towards sepsis. There were 13.4% (n = 13) death mainly due to septic shock and the highest number was found in the extremely high risks category, followed by moderate risk with increasing value of PCT of >5 ng/ml on day 5. Rapid PCT demonstrated a remarkable finding as it assists early detection of bacterial infection and guiding clinicians to commence empirical antibiotic therapy based on day 1 of PCT value. It also aids in predicting the prognostication in relation to severity of the infection by monitoring the PCT value.",

            "text": "Background: Selective reporting of antimicrobial susceptibilities is one strategy commonly used among antimicrobial stewardship programs. Fluoroquinolone (FQ) susceptibility reporting was suppressed at our institution from 2011 until April 2016, during which time results were released only following special request from a clinician. After April 2016, FQ susceptibility was released as part of routine susceptibility reporting. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the \"unmasking\" of FQ susceptibility results had any effect on the use of FQ for culture-directed treatment of an infection. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of inpatient intravenous and oral FQ prescriptions for culture-directed therapy during a two month period prior to and after the \"unmasking\" of FQ in April 2016. FQ prescriptions were defined as appropriate if the only appropriate alternative was a carbapenem, or if it was the only appropriate oral agent prior to discharge. Overall FQ utilization was measured six months before and after this change in protocol. Results: There were 48 FQ prescriptions per month for culturedirected treatment before the change in protocol versus 80 FQ prescriptions per month afterwards. The percentage of inappropriate FQ use also increased from 49.5% to 60.6% before versus after the \"unmasking\". The most frequent indications for culturedirected FQ inappropriate use were for the treatment of urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections in both time periods. The mean monthly fluoroquinolone utilization remained unchanged at 259 defined daily doses per 1,000 patient days before and after unmasking of FQ susceptibility. Conclusion: Selective reporting is a useful intervention in limiting the number of inappropriate fluoroquinolone prescriptions, which in turn can influence gram-negative resistance, MRSA and C.difficle rates in a hospital. strategy to decrease antibiotic resistance in hospital, particularly in intensive care setting. Methods: Antibiogram profile from Clinical Pathology Department of National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita Jakarta was retrospectively analyzed.

Namavari 1 , S. Kamkar-salehi 2 Neospora caninum, Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), and Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD) are the most important agent causes abortion in cattle worldwide. These infection agents cause reproductive disorders which can lead in economic loss in dairy and beef herds. Serological test including ELISA are calculated as the best diagnostic ways for Neospora caninum, IBR, and BVD. The aim of this study was to develop a multiplex Dot-ELISA kit for simultaneous detecting of three abortion agents: Neospora caninum, IBR, and BVD. The blood samples were collected from 184 cows with a history of abortion in the northern of Fars province. Then sera samples were evaluated by Multiplex Dot-ELISA and compare with commercial ELISA kits. Results showed that the rate of positive sera by use of commercial kits for Neospora caninum IBR and BVDV were 32. 98.9 and 64.1%, and by Dot-Elisa were 79.3 points 29.3 and 93.5 respectively. Kappa agreement assessment demonstrated that appropriate agreement between Multiplex Dot-ELISA results and ELISA kits, and McNemar test showed that both methods have the same efficacy for the identification of these abortion agents. The results of this study revealed that multiple Dot-ELISA kit, could be a simple and economical method for the simultaneous detection of three abortion agents in cattle. This experimentally kit is designed as the first step in designing a multiple kit for the diagnosis of infections in cows which could be introduced with complementary studies as a commercial kit in the future.

However, sputum is the contaminated specimen so that the big challenge must be overcome is to confirm the isolated bacteria is the pathogen, not the contaminated one. In addition, the most common pathogens of the lower respiratory tract infection are the fastidious bacteria requiring the immediate isolating on multiple media. Another specimen should be collected to detect bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia is the blood culture. The main challenge in the blood culture is the ratio of blood culture blood culture [+] in the diagnosis of pneumonia is often low and sometimes false positives because of contamination. So that blood cultures must be done at the right time on the appropriate blood cultures media. Serological and immunochemical test to detect the specific antibodies and antigens of the causative pathogens are the main solution for the detection of the pathogens that cannot be cultured routinely in most of the clinical laboratory like viruses and atypical bacteria, but these kinds of tests are often not sensitive and specificity enough (antigen and IgM detection) as well as not clinical relevant (IgG detection). Innovative and the most feasible solutions at present that can be able to detect microbial agents causing LRI are using the multiplex real-time PCR technique thank to its high sensitive and specificity, easily performed in the clinical laboratories due to the moderate investment costs and can implement automation. Methods and results: This solution has been evaluated by several studies were conducted in Nguyen Tri Phuong and Children No. 1 hospital, and now in REALS project. The received results have shown that multiplex real-time PCR capable of detecting pathogenic microbial agents with the sensitivity several times higher than the routine method. Model to implement this solution is called STREAMLINE REAL-TIME PCR with two basic devices: (1) The automatic DNA/RNA extraction machine using NK DNARNAPREP-MAGBEAD, and (2) the real-time PCR machine using kits including NK ARIbac real-time PCR for detection of community bacteria, NK ARIatypicalbac real-time PCR for detection of atypical bacteria, NK ARIvirus real-time PCR for detection of viral pathogen, NK HAPVAPbac real-time PCR for detection of nosocomial bacteria causing HAP and VAP bacterial pathogens. Conclusions: With this solution, the results of detection microbiological pathogens causing lower respiratory infection can arrive to the physicians timely, avoid the using of the empirical antibiotic treatment for longtime since the targeted antibiotic treatment can be done to the patients sort time after the clinical diagnosis.

The study aimed to evaluate the time to positivity (TTP), procalcitonin (PCT) level, and TTP/PCT ratio as reliable predictors for distinguishing true bacteremia from contaminated blood culture or intravascular catheter colonization. Methods: The study was retrospectively conducted in a university hospital in South Korea from January 2014 to December 2016. Subjects included febrile hospitalized adult patients (\u226518 years) who had one or more positive blood cultures with available TTP and PCT data. The clinical findings of the patients were meticulously reviewed by an infectious disease physician. Positive blood cultures were categorized into true bacteremia and inconclusive bacteremia. True bacteremia was defined as having two clinically relevant positive blood cultures obtained on separate occasions. Inconclusive bacteremia was defined as a contaminated, single positive blood culture or catheter colonization.",

In addition, TTP/PCT ratio could be useful in predicting true bacteremia. Keywords: procalcitonin, time to positivity, TTP/PCT ratio, bacteremia The qnrB gene is prevalent in Citrobacter freundii clinical isolates. However, there are no reports regarding the coexistence between the qnrB and bla VIM-2 genes. The aims of this study were to access the coexistence of these two genes and the potential of multidrug resistance transfer, and to characterize the mobile element involved. MICs of the antibiotics and an efflux pump inhibitor were determined in a clinical isolate, its transformant and site-directed mutant, according to guidelines of CLSI, by agar dilution method. Molecular characterizations of qnrB62 gene and its mobile element were performed by PCR amplification, DNA sequencing, PFGE and/ or Southern blot analysis. Coexistence of qnrB62 (encoding QnrB62 with Ser198Asn substitution, compared with QnrB5) with bla VIM-2 gene was detected in a Citrobacter clinical isolate resistant to fluoroquinolones and carbapenems. The reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility is attributable to the qnrB62, a Thr83Ile substitution in GyrA and a Ser80Ile substitution in ParC, and efflux pump(s) other than QepA or OqxAB. The genetic context surrounding chromosomal qnrB62 was a novel complex class 1 integron (In1148::ISCR1::qnrB62) containing a unique gene array (bla VIM-2 -aacA4\u2032-8-gucD) in a new class 1 integron (In1148). An 18 nucleotide deletion at the 3\u2032 end of pspA (\u039418) upstream of qnrB62 and an inverted repeat region (IRR2) were detected in In1148::ISCR1::qnrB62, indicating past transposition events. The fluoroquinolone and carbapenem resistance associated with the In1148::ISCR1::qnrB62 integron could be related to a potential multidrug resistance horizontal spread that is worrisome worldwide.",

Background: Combination of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) is commonly used in the treatment of Haemophilus influenzae infections. However, nowadays it is rarely used for treatment due to emergence of H. influenzae SXT-resistant strains. Resistance to trimethoprim is attributed to altered structure of dihydrofolate reductase gene while sulfonamide resistance is due to mutation in folP gene as well as, acquisition of sul2 gene. In this study, we investigated whether these resistance genes in a strain of nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) could be transferred to H. influenzae type B (Hib) by conjugation; and to determine if integrative and conjugative element (ICE) is involved in this process. Methods: Three types of mating procedures (filter-paper method, liquid-suspension method and agar-plate method) were carried out, in donor to recipient ratio volumes of 1:1 and 1:10. NTHi strain H152 resistant to SXT was the donor, while Hib strain H582, resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol was the recipient. Following overnight incubation, transconjugants bearing resistant genes were enumerated. PCR was used to detect the presence of attB in both strains, for common sequence of attachment site of ICE. Results: Repeated trials performed failed to produce transconjugants in all the mating methods. attB gene was detected in the Hib strain but absent in the NTHi strain was a possible reason that conjugative transfer of SXT-resistance genes did not occur. Conclusion: The genes responsible for SXT resistance in this NTHi strain are stable in its chromosome because this strain lacks the attB of an ICE for site-specific recombination to take place. Background: Moraxella catarrhalis is one of the important pathogen causing infectious diseases. The significance of Moraxella catarrhalis in community-acquired pneumonia is increasing with the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. The aim of the study is to detect the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern and \u03b2lactamase activity characteristics of 178 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates collected from two county hospitals in China. Methods: Antibiotic susceptibility against 11 antimicrobials were tested using the E-test method or disc diffusion. The test results were interpreted with reference to the standards of European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC). Detection of \u03b2lactamase activity was determined by the chromogenic cephalosporin nitrocefin (BR66A; Oxoid). Results: All of the isolates were susceptible to amoxicillinclavulanic acid. The susceptibility rate to meropenem was 100% according to EUCAST, as there was no breakpoints listed in CLSI and BSAC. The non-susceptibility rate to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in the two counties showed significant difference no matter which judgment criteria was used, and isolates in Zhongjiang were more sensitive than strains in Youyang. The total positive rate of \u03b2lactamase was 99.4% (177/178 cases), as it was 99.0% (100/101 cases) in Youyang and 100% (77/77 cases) in Zhongjiang. Conclusion: Almost all of the Moraxella catarrhalis isolates produce \u03b2-lactamase. The isolates showed poor susceptibility to ampicillin and erythromycin, and high susceptibility rate to the third-and fourth-generation cephalosporins and amoxicillinclavulanic. There were some significant discrepancy between different antimicrobial susceptibility breakpoint criteria of Moraxella catarrhalis.",

This is the first study conducted with the aim to determine the prevalence and drug resistance pattern of early UTI among renal transplant recipients at Human Organ and Transplant Center (HOTC), Nepal. Methods: A prospective descriptive study was conducted among renal transplant recipients transplanted between April to December 2016 at HOTC, and followed up until 3 month after transplant. Patients were screened for UTI, fortnightly for the first month and monthly for next two month and whenever sign and symptoms suggestive of UTI were present and questionnaires were filled up. Midstream urine and catheterized urine from newly inserted catheter were collected and processed according to the standard methodology. Both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases with bacterial colony count \u226510 5 cfu/ml were included. Combination disk method was applied for the detection of extended spectrum \u03b2lactamase (ESBL) and metallo \u03b2lactamase (MBL) producing isolates. Results: Total of 80 renal transplant recipients were included in the study, of which, 78% (n = 62) were male and 22% (n = 18) were female. Mean age of both genders was 35 years with standard deviation of 11 years. Total of 54 episodes of UTI were observed in 38.7% (n = 31/80) of transplant recipients, including 37% of male and 44% of female patients; (23/62) vs (8/18), (P value >0.05). Gram negative bacteria accounted for more than 90% of the UTI episodes. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the major bacteria, isolated in 42.6% (n = 23) of cases, followed by E. coli observed in 35.1% (n = 19) of cases. Other isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Citrobacter spp. All gram negative isolates were multidrug resistant. Increased level of resistance was observed against the most of drugs including; imipenem-44%, amikacin-57%, Gentamycin-61%, pipracillin tazobactam-83%, ofloxacin and ceftazidime 89% each, ceftriaxone-92%, cotrimoxazole -96%, amoxycillin and cefixime-98% each. Alarmingly high resistance to the carbapenem (78%), was observed among the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Polymixin B, colistin sulphate and tigecycline were only drugs with 100% susceptibility. The study showed high prevalence of gram negative isolates producing MBL (39.2%; n = 20/51) and ESBL (17.6%; n = 9/51). Carbapenem resistance due to carriage of MBL was alarmingly high among the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 73.9% (17/23). ESBL production was most common among the strains of E. coli, 42.1% (8/19).",

Moreover, E. coli is becoming resistant to commonly used antimicrobials in most parts of the world. Molecular characterization of class 1 integrons and prevalence of antibiotic resistance to E. coli from cattle, sheep and goats is reported. Methods: Swab stool specimens were collected from 250 cattle, sheep and goats from different parts of Fars province in Iran. Isolation and characterization were performed according to standard methodology including biochemical test for identification of E. coli and PCR for detection of the integron gene in isolates. Results: 173 E. coli strains were isolated, all of which were resistant to at least one antibiotic. 100% were resistant to amoxicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, ampicillin and co-trimoxazole, 92% to erythromycin and neomycin, 88% to gentamicin and 84% to amikacin. More than 50% were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole, enorfloxacin and cefalexin. Prevalence of integrons in the E. coli isolates was 34% and lack of antibiotic susceptibility to antibiotics was associated with its presence in bacteria. Discussion: E. coli may select a specific gene cassette through antibiotic selective pressure resulting in class 1 integron differences.

Sitthisak 1 *. 1 Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Faculty of Medical Science, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand Conjugation is the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) that provides the most important mechanism to accelerate the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in Gram negative bacteria. Our study aims to determine gene transfer of extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDR-AB) to A. baumannii isolated from environment using conjugation. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined. Carbapenemase resistance genes (bla OXA-23 and bla NDM-1 ), aminoglycoside resistance gene (aphA6) and tetracycline resistance gene (tetB) were detected in all isolates. All drug susceptible Acinetobacter spp. recipients were selected for sodium azide resistance induction. Two isolates (NU013R, NU015R) which were resistant to sodium azide were used as recipient. Conjugation assays were performed to investigate the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes of 15 strains of XDR-AB to two sodium azide resistance isolates. Transconjugants were recovered on Mueller-Hinton agar plates containing sodium azide plus ticarcillin; plus tetracycline and plus kanamycin. Conjugation experiments demonstrated that resistance to ticarcillin and kanamycin could be transferred from only four XDR-AB donors to two sodium azide resistant A. baumannii. Conjugation frequencies (CF) for ticarcillin resistance varied from 2.0-3.7 \u00d7 10 \u22125 and CF of kanamycin resistance range from 2.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 to 5.7 \u00d7 10 \u22127 . No transconjugant was detected on LBA with tetracycline. We found donor AB364 can transfer the bla OXA-23 gene to recipients, NU013R and NU015R, however the bla NDM-1 gene was negative in these transconjugants. The donors AB140, AB352 and AB405 can transfer kanamycin resistance gene (aphA6) to recipients, NU013R and NU015R. The REP-PCR profiles of donors, recipients and transconjugants were performed. The banding patterns of transconjugants were similar to the recipients. This work underlines how efficient the spread of the antibiotic resistance gene using conjugation could be among A. baumannii.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors associated with CRE fecal colonization among inpatients. Material and Methods: Rectal swabs from 50 patients in a university hospital were collected. CRE screening was performed by using selective media. Carbapenemase production was detected by phenotypic tests. PCR assays were used to detect carbapenemases genes. Clonal relatedness was investigated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: The prevalence of fecal colonization was 56% (28/50). Overall, 41 CRE isolates were identified, of which 38 were carbapenemase-producers. Eleven patients (39.3%) were co-colonized with CRE isolates. ICU hospitalization, prior antibiotic therapy, and mechanical ventilation were significant risk factors. The bla OXA-48 was the most frequent carbapenemases followed by bla NDM-1 andbla NDM-7 enzyme. Nine carpapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) isolates co-harbored bla NDM-1 and bla . Also, six CPE isolates co-harboredbla NDM-7 and bla OXA-48 . We did not detect bla KPC , bla GES , bla IMP and bla VIM . PFGE analysis showed that E. coli clones were diverse, while K. pneumoniae categorize in 3 clusters. Cluster I was the major clone carrying bla OXA-48 and bla CTXM-15 genes. Conclusions: Our study as the first investigation in Iran showed CRE not only had high prevalence in fecal carriages, but also harbored varied antimicrobial resistance elements. Background: In Republic of Korea, carbapenemase producing enterobacteriaciae (CPE) infected patients were increased every year. Critical problem could be emerged in Korean public health system. From June 2015 to June 2016, two hospitals in Republic of Korea suffered from the outbreak of CPE. Those two hospitals were included in national surveillance whereby Korea Centers for Disease Control & prevention (KCDC) were completely controlled occurring of patients of CPE by intervention and control of transmission. Herein, we described medical and epidemiological characteristics of CPE patients in two hospitals and explained how control nosocomial transmission of CPE. Method: We reviewed the epidemiologic investigation reports for all cases about CPE outbreak in each hospital (hospital A: 36 patients, hospital B: 22 patients). We also reviewed medical records to collect data about the clinical course. The isolates of CPE were analyzed by National research Institute of Health in Korea for evaluation of carbapenemase. Based on the microbiologic results, we confirmed the outbreak of CPE. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to clarify the epidemiologic correlation. Result: In hospital A, total 36 patients were involved in CPE (Klebsiella pneumoniae, KPC type carbapenemase) outbreak which occurred from surgical intensive care unit (SICU). 29 patients were transmitted in SICU, 5 patients were in medical intensive care unit (MICU), and 2 patients were exposed in general ward. We applied intensive CPE control strategies include active surveillance, patients isolation, emphasis of contact precaution to medical staffs, and preemptive isolation. About 11 months later, CPE outbreak in hospital A was terminated. In hospital B, 23 patients were in CPE (Klebsiella pneumoniae, NDM-1 type carbapenemase) outbreak which was originated from neuro-surgical intensive care unit (NSICU). Index case was occurred in SICU but he was admitted in neurosurgery (NS) department, because of cross-spread by doctors in NS, transmission of CPE in NSICU were generated. We closed NSICU for prevention occurrence of new CPE exposure. After intervention for control CPE outbreak, the outbreak was terminated within 1 month. Conclusion: We experienced CPE outbreak which occurred based on hospital setting. We successfully controlled that situation by strictly applying strategies of infection control.",

Sitthisak 1 . 1 Department of Microbiology and Parasitology, Faculty of Medical Science, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand, 2 Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium which increases in prevalence of multiple-drug resistance strains have been documented worldwide. The copper resistance is one of the important mechanisms required for bacterial survival in environments and pathogenesis. This work aimed to characterize copper susceptibility, prevalence of copper associated genes and their expression profiles in A. baumannii clinical isolates. The copper associated genes were detected by the PCR assay in 102 clinical isolates of A. baumannii obtained from 3 hospitals in Thailand. The copper susceptibility testing was performed by the agar dilution method. The association of gene patterns and copper resistance was analyzed by using Fisher's exact test. The representative isolate was selected to study the effect of copper on the expressions of copper-related genes by using RT-qPCR. The prevalence of cueR and copR genes among tested strains was 100% (102/102) and 18.63% (19/102) respectively. The copper susceptibility study revealed that strains with high MIC copper (10 mM) were found in 24.51% (25 isolates), while 75.49% (77 isolates) of tested strains have MIC copper lower than 10 mM. We found that all 19 cueR + /copR + strains (100%) were resistant to copper (MIC = 10 mM) while only 6 of 83 (7.23%) of cueR + /copR \u2212 strains were copper resistant strains (P < 0.01). We also designed additional primers to detect structural genes of both cue and cop operons in a representative strain, AB 1521. We found that AB 1521 contains two structural genes (genes encoding for copper efflux pump and multi-copper oxidase) of cue operon, while cop operon contains six structural genes (genes encoding for CopB, CopA, CopC, copD, copper efflux pump and hypothetical protein). The results from RT-qPCR showed that all genes of cue operon were up-regulated at the micro-and millimolar levels of copper, while all genes of cop operon were over-expressed only at the millimolar levels of copper. This suggested that cue operon was intrinsic resistance system found in all analyzed strains and the cop operon was associated with copper resistance at the higher concentration of copper. The future study need to conduct in order to confirm the gene functions involved in copper resistance and pathogenesis.

However, it is not known how bacteria harboring this resistant gene will respond when carbapenem therapy is initiated to a patient. This study investigates the change in plasmid copy number of bla OXA-48 under exposure of different concentration of carbapenems. Methods: Clinical isolates of E. coli harboring bla OXA-48 within IncFrepB type plasmid were grown under exposure of imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem with concentrations of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 \u03bcg/ml each. Plasmids were extracted and quantitative real time PCR was carried out to estimate the relative copy number of bla OXA-48 and fold change was normalized against housekeeping gene rpsel. Stability of bla OXA-48 was determined by serial passage without antibiotic pressure and curing of plasmid was done using different concentrations of SDS, acridine orange and ethidium bromide. Results: The copy number of bla OXA-48 was found to consistently higher as the concentration of ertapenem and meropenem was increased whereas in case of imipenem it was vice versa. Plasmids encoding bla OXA-48 were found to be highly stable and could be successfully eliminated after single treatment with SDS & is considered as the most efficient curing agent. The cured mutants became susceptible to carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides. Conclusion: This study could establish that carbapenems effectively interfere with plasmid copy number, conjugative transfer, propagation and maintenance within a host, which in turn, help in bacterial adaptability in clinical settings and also significant for future infectious disease risk assessment and minimizing the selective pressure within the hospital environment. morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance evolved in bacteria mainly include \u03b2-lactamase and efflux pump activities. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the \u03b2-lactamaseand efflux pump-mediated antibiotic resistance in laboratory-induced and clinically isolated antibiotic resistant strains of Salmonella Typhimurium. The antibiotic susceptibilities of S. Typhimurium ATCC 19585 (WT-ST), ciprofloxacin-induced antibiotic-resistant S. Typhimurium ATCC 19585 (CI-ST), and clinically-acquired antibiotic-resistant S. Typhimurium ATCC 19585 (CA-ST) were determined in the absence and presence of \u03b2-lactamase (clavulanate, sulbactam, tazobactam, and BLI-489) and efflux pump (CCCP and PA\u03b2N) inhibitors. The \u03b2-lactamase and efflux pump activity of WT-ST, CI-ST, and CA-ST were measured by nitrocefin hydrolysis and ethidium bromide (EtBr) accumulation assays, respectively. The susceptibilities of WT-ST, CI-ST, and CA-ST to most classes of antibiotics such as \u03b2-lactam, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside, and macrolide were considerably increased in the presence of \u03b2lactamase and efflux pump inhibitors. The \u03b2-lactamase activities were 11, 13, and 26 \u03bcmol/min/ml, respectively, for WT-ST, CI-ST, and CA-ST, which were increased to 13, 24, and 63 \u03bcmol/min/ml when exposed to ceftriaxone. The EtBr residues remained high in CI-ST (86%) and CA-ST (90%) when treated with PA\u03b2N. This study would provide useful information for better understating of the development of antibiotic resistance in association with \u03b2-lactamase and efflux pump activities and designing new antibiotic chemotherapy in combination with inhibitors. analysis.

Methods: Both isolates were subjected to EDTA-and phenylboronic acid (PBA)-carbapenem combined disk tests and characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Results: Both isolates were confirmed to be class A IMI-1 carbapenemase producers by the presence of the synergy between imipenem and PBA followed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The bla IMI-1 was chromosomally encoded. Both of them gave an indistinguishable ERIC-PCR pattern. Neither extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) nor plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) was found in any isolate. They lacked OmpF but contained an identical OmpC variant. Both isolates remained susceptible to the third generation cephalosporins but were resistant to carbapenems with higher level resistance to imipenem (MIC of 16 mg/L) than those of ertapenem and meropenem. In addition, they were resistant to colistin (4 and 32 mg/L). Both patients were improved after antimicrobial therapy with either coamoxiclav or meropenem. Conclusion: Few reports of the IMI-1 enzyme may be due to its poor hydrolysis activity to the third-generation cephalosporins, suggesting the awareness of the unusual \u03b2-lactam resistance profile of the IMI producers. No statistically significant trends over time were found in any country; however, both Thailand and Vietnam showed a greater rate of ESBLs than other countries. Analysis of susceptibility patterns across countries was performed using data from the last 3 years combined to increase sample sizes. Susceptibility in Southeast Asia overall was low for most cephalosporins (<62%) and fluoroquinolones (<42%). Susceptibility was especially reduced in Vietnam (<40% and 22%, respectively) and Thailand (<55% and 32%, respectively), corresponding with the high ESBL+ rates in these countries. Of the studied agents, only amikacin, ertapenem, and imipenem demonstrated susceptibility >90% in each country. Conclusion: ESBL+ E. coli rates were high in Southeast Asia but overall relatively stable. Rates varied by country, with especially high levels seen in Vietnam and Thailand. As expected considering the high ESBL+ rates and co-resistance often found in ESBL+ isolates, susceptibility was low for cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, limiting therapeutic options for UTI in Southeast Asia. Backgrounds: Opportunity for safe and successful treatment of carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter bacteremia (CRAB) bacteremia with appropriate antibiotic(s) (AA) is very limited in the real world. However, survivors without an AA does exist. We aim to review on the clinical features of these patients in order to characterize potential favorable prognostic factors for survival without an AA. Methods: All patients aged \u226518 years with CRAB bacteremia were retrospectively identified between Apr 2012 and Mar 2015 at five hospitals located in South Korea. Use of the AA was defined as administration of antimicrobial agent, to which the causative pathogen was susceptible, for more than 48 hours, within 5 days of the onset of bacteremia. Case (survivor) was defined as a patient who survived more than 28 days without use of any AA, while control (death) was defined as a patient who died within 5 days of blood culture without use of any AA. . Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the agar dilution method according to the CLSI guidelines. The following antimicrobials were tested: piperacillin, piperacillintazobactam, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin, moxifloxacin, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole. An inoculum of 10 5 CFU was applied with a Steers replicator and the plates were incubated in an anaerobic chamber for 48 h at 37\u00b0C.

The MIC for meropenem and ertapenem were changed from 4 and 8 \u00b5g/ml to 0.25 and 0.5 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. WGS analysis revealed that both the wild-type and mutant strains were found to have bla SHV-11 , bla TEM-B , bla OXA-4 beta-lactamase genes. However, there was an excision of 9 Kb nucleotide fragment from the plasmid associated with class 1 integron encoding bla CMY-10 gene in one of the susceptible mutants. Interestingly, neither inverted (IR) or direct repeats (DR) were detected, presumably due to the two transposase genes located at the 5\u2032 end which did not leave any IR/DR marks. In addition, there were SNP's in two novel efflux pumps in all the mutants. OmpK35 and OmpK36 were found to be absent in both wild type and the mutants. Conclusion: The loss of function of two novel efflux pumps along with the deletion of 9 Kb nucleotide fragment, induced by the SOS response due to radiation, might have reversed the carbapenem resistance. CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout studies are in progress to understand the conclusive role of these targets. aureus (VISA) have been associated with treatment failure and the hVISA could not be detected by a simple disc diffusion method. Currently, there is no specific genetic marker for hVISA detection. Several genetic alterations were reported to be associated with the low-level vancomycin resistance in S. aureus. The aim of this study was to compare the isaA and rplN genes expression of VISA and hVISA with those of vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) isolates. Methods: A total of 75 MRSA isolates were classified as 32 VSSA, 28 hVISA and 15 VISA by population analysis profile with area under the curve (PAP-AUC). The expression levels of isaA and rplN genes in all isolates were determined by relative quantification real time RT-PCR and using 16s rRNA as the reference gene. The minimum inhibitory concentrations to vancomycin were determined by an agar dilution method. Results: The ranges of PAP-AUC for VSSA, hVISA and VISA groups were 0.12-0.87, 0.9-1.27, 1.35-3.91 with vancomycin MICs of 1-2, 1-3, 4->16 \u00b5g/mL, respectively. The VISA isolates showed significant higher relative expression of isaA than those of hVISA and VSSA (5.3 and 7.4 folds, respectively, p < 0.001), whereas rplN mean relative expression of hVISA was 2.2 folds higher than that of VSSA ( p = 0.037). Conclusion: This preliminary study reflects the potential role of the isaA and rplN expression as tool for the differentiation of hVISA and VISA from VSSA. Nocardia species are ubiquitous bacteria which can cause severe disseminated infection in humans. As their antibiogram is largely species-specific, susceptibility testing is not routinely performed for Nocardia species and sulphonamides remain the cornerstone of treatment. However with increasing sulphonamide resistance reported and geographical variability both in species distribution and in the resistance rate, there is a need to understand the local epidemiology and to detect any emerging resistance in the institution. This study aims to survey the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical Nocardia species received in a large tertiary hospital in Australia. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed on 270 clinical Nocardia isolates received from January 2011 to December 2016 using the Sensititre\u2122 RAPMYCOI microdilution panel (TREK Diagnostic Systems Ltd, Thermo Scientific). These were identified by partial 16S rRNA and/or secA1 sequencing and the panel of antibiotics tested were amikacin, amoxicillin-clavunalate, cefepime, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, clarithromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, minocycline, imipenem, linezolid, tobramycin and tigecycline. The three most frequently isolated Nocardia species were Nocardia nova complex (n = 80; 29.6%), Nocardia cyriacigeorgica complex (n = 61; 22.6%) and Nocardia brasiliensis (n = 52; 19.3%). Other species isolated included: Nocardia farcinica (n = 38; 14.1%), Nocardia psuedobrasiliensis (n = 8; 3.0%), Nocardia beijingensis (n = 6; 2.2%), Nocardia abscessus complex (n = 4; 1.5%), Nocardia transvalensis complex (n = 4; 1.5%) and other Nocardia species (n = 17; 6.3%) Of the tested strains, 25 (9.3%) isolates displayed resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (MIC 90 , 2/38 \u00b5g/mL); 40% of resistant strains were N. farcinica followed by N. pseudobrasiliensis (24%) and N. nova complex (16%) respectively. More than half of the isolates were resistant to imipenem (59.3%; MIC 90 , >64 \u00b5g/mL). Most isolates were susceptible to linezolid and amikacin with MIC 90 values of 4 \u00b5g/mL and <1 \u00b5g/mL respectively. Majority of resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is detected in Nocardia farcinica. Linezolid and amikacin remain as active agents and are good options in the treatment of Nocardia infection in this institution.",

Infections by it especially methicillin resistant ones are often difficult to manage due to its resistance to multiple antibiotics. Macrolide-lincosamide streptogramin B family of antibiotics is commonly used to treat such infections as an alternative to vancomycin. Method: A descriptive cross sectional study was conducted over the period of one and half year (November 2013-April 2015) in the microbiology laboratory of Nepal Medical College and Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal to find the incidence of different phenotypes of MLS B resistance among S. aureus from clinical samples and their association with methicillin resistance. The study was done in 270 non-repeated isolates of S. aureus from clinical specimens ( pus, blood, urine, sputum and body fluids) from both gender and all age groups of patients attending NMCTH. Identification of S. aureus was first done using colony morphology on 5% sheep blood agar. Cream to golden yellow colonies with or without haemolysis were further identified using Gram stain, catalase test and coagulase test by standard microbiological techniques. Antibiotic susceptibility were studied by modified Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton Agar plates (12 cm diameter) using ampicillin (10 \u03bcg), cotrimoxazole (1.25/ 23.75 \u03bcg), ciprofloxacin (5 \u03bcg), vancomycin (30 \u03bcg), cephalexin (30 ug) and gentamycin (10 ug) discs. Cefoxitin (30 ug) for the detection of methicillin resistance and erythromycin (15 \u03bcg), clindamycin (2 \u03bcg) discs (Hi-media-India) at 15 mm apart were also used on same plate for the detection of inducible clindamycin resistance as per CLSI guidelines. Isolates with cefoxitin zone size \u226522 mm were considered methicillin susceptible and those with \u226421 mm were considered methicillin resistant. Isolates resistant to erythromycin and having a clindamycin zone \u226521 mm with a D-shaped zone were regarded as positive for inducible resistance ( i MLS B phenotype). Isolates resistant to erythromycin and susceptible to clindamycin were considered negative for D-test (MS phenotype) and those resistant to both erythromycin and clindamycin were regarded as constitutive resistance phenotypes ( c MLS B ). Isolates susceptible to both erythromycin and clindamycin were regarded as susceptible strains.",

Of 270 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (150 from male patients and 120 from female patients), 147 (54.4%), 60 (22.2%), 38 (14.0%), 20 (7.4%) and 5 (1.85%) were obtained from pus, blood, sputum, urine and body fluids respectively. Among the processed samples the highest positivity rate was found in pus sample (9.7.0%) followed by sputum (2.4%), blood (1.2%), body fluids (0.6%) and urine (0.2%). Among the antibiotics tested all the isolates were susceptible only to vancomycin. Gentamycin was still found to have better action as compared with other antibiotics. However, most of the isolates were resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Higher percentage of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin among MRSA indicates that there is wide use of erythromycin and clindamycin for the treatment of staphylococcal infections in our set up. As this resistant patterns can be decreased by reduction in the use of macrolides, this study emphasizes the need to do likewise in our set up to reserve it as an alternative drug of choice for treating infection caused by MRSA. Low level of susceptibility of erythromycin resistant MRSA towards clindamycin means there is a least chance of clinical efficacy of clindamycin while treating erythromycin resistant MRSA infections as an alternative to vancomycin. These findings further emphasize the need of Dtest to be performed routinely in our set up to avoid clinical failure while using clindamycin as an alternative to anti-MRSA antibiotics like vancomycin and linezolid. Keywords: Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Inducible clindamycin resistance, Nepal Introduction: The major community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strain in Korea, ST72-SCCmecVI, has been spreading in both community and healthcare setting, raising serious public health concerns. In this investigation, potential genotype-specific susceptibility profiles to host defense cationic antimicrobial peptides (HD-CAPs) were assessed using ST72-SCCmecIV and ST5-SCCmecII MRSA strains. Methods: We used 11 ST72-SCCmec IV and 9 ST5-SCCmec II MRSA clinical isolates, and assessed: (i) antibiotic resistance profiles; (ii) susceptibility to HD-CAPs (LL-37 and polymyxin B); (iii) relative net cell surface charge using FITC-labeled poly-L-lysine binding assay; (iv) transcriptional profiles of the genes involved in surface charge regulation in S. aureus (mprF and dltABCD); (v) spa type and superantigenic toxin type. Results: ST5-SCCmecII strains exhibited higher level of antibiotic resistance, especially multidrug resistance than ST72-SCCmecIV CA-MRSA strains. The ST5-SCCmecII strains also displayed higher resistance to LL-37 and PMB killing than the CA-MRSA strains, paralleling with higher level of surface positive charge linked to enhanced transcription of mprF and dltABCD among the ST5-SCCmecII strains. Conclusions: CA-MRSA ST72-SCCmecIV has been associated with lower mortality compared with ST5-SCCmecII MRSA strains, suggesting the CA-MRSA strains to be less virulent. In the current investigation, our data suggested that the lower pathogenicity of ST72-SCCmecIV MRSA compared with ST5-SCCmecII MRSA is associated with higher susceptibility to HD-CAPs, one of the critical elements in host innate immune system.

Penicillin resistance rates of 12-40% have been reported and are due to beta-lactamases. Oxacillin resistance rates are less than 10%. We attempted to observe the temporal susceptibility trends for S. lugdunensis. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, we looked at antibiotic susceptibility data for S. lugdunensis from 2014 to 2016 at a tertiary care centre in Singapore. Susceptibility was routinely performed using either Vitek II or Kirby Bauer and interpreted using CLSI criteria (CLSI, M100). Results: A total of 440 isolates of S. lugdunensis were identified. Majority were from sites other than blood and urine (83%). Penicillin resistance was seen in 51% of isolates, and oxacillin resistance in 7.83%. Most isolates were susceptible to fluroquinolones, doxycycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to erythromycin (10%) and clindamycin (7.2%) was noted. Conclusion: In comparison to a study conducted in Singapore in 2005, which showed penicillin-resistance rates of 27%, there seems to be increasing penicillin-resistance among S. lugdunensis isolates.

Wongthong 1,3 *, P. Tippayawat 2,3 , A. Chanawong 2,3 , R. Tavichakorntrakool 2,3 , C. Wilailuckana 2,3 , A. Lulitanond 2,3 . . Some VISA and hVISA isolates were reported to have rpoB mutation, which may play a major role in the development of vancomycin resistance in S. aureus. This gene encodes for a \u03b2-subunit of RNA polymerase, which is active in catalysis reaction. Some mutations in rpoB conferred transcriptional activity of the whole RNA polymerase. The most common mutation of rpoB in VISA was a substitution of H481Y. Therefore, we aimed to examine the rpoB mutations in MRSA isolates from a Thai university hospital. Methods: Ten MRSA isolates were classified for their vancomycin resistant phenotypes by using population analysis profile with area under the curve (PAP-AUC) method. The nucleotide sequences of rpoB from all isolates were determined and compared with that of the wild type isolate. Results: The 10 MRSA isolates included 3 VSSA, 2 hVISA and 5 VISA with their PAP-AUC ranges of 0.85-0.86, 0.92-1.05 and 1.46-1.91 respectively. Several isolates contained rpoB mutations. Two isolates of each VSSA, hVISA and VISA had amino acid substitution at H481N and/or S529L, similar to those previously reported in the MRSA isolates from several countries including Thailand. In addition, silent mutation was found in a VSSA, 2 hVISA, and 3 VISA isolates. Mutation of rpoB was not found in one VSSA isolate. Conclusion: Mutations in rpoB gene may be related to vancomycin resistance in S. aureus and should be further studied. Background: Vancomycin is mainly used for the treatment of patients with Staphylococcus aureus infections, and the decreased susceptibility to vancomycin is becoming increasingly common. Therefore, the finding of novel markers for the development of diagnostic tools for vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) will be important. We applied a genome-wide association approach for discrimination between VISA and vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus (VSSA) using 79 whole-genome sequences (24 clinical isolates and 55 publicly available genome sequences). Methods: Vancomycin susceptibility was determined using agar dilution, broth microdilution, and E-test. Strains with MIC of >2 \u03bcg/ml in any of the three methods were defined as VISA. Genomic DNA was isolated from an overnight culture using the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit and genome sequencing was performed using either the Illumina Miseq or PacBio RS II suquencer. We applied a quality-control to clean up raw reads using PRINSEQ version 0.20.3 and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling performed using the samtools and bcftool. Functional annotations of the SNPs were carried out using an in-house developed perl script. We performed an association study using the PLINK software package and PPFS (Predict Phenotypes from SNPs) package add-on to kSNP3.0 and confirmed the SNPs associated with VISA phenotype using ClustalW multiple amino acid sequence alignment. Results: We obtained 46 SNPs which were associated with VISA phenotype. Among them, 27 SNPs showed substitution of nonsynonymous amino acid and 10 SNPs showed no amino acid change. We selected 5 candidates associated with reduced vancomycin susceptibility among 27 SNPs, based on the location and their function. Analysis using ClustalW multiple sequence alignment indicated that two novel SNPs were possible to distinguish VSSA and VISA, including iron transport SA_RS08075 (I63T) and KtrB (L212M). Conclusion: We found two novel markers to discriminate the VISA and VSSA, but additional study will be required to identify functional differences related to antibiotic resistance that may be resulted from these SNPs. Background: Small colony variant (SCV) is a slow-growing bacterial subpopulation, generally showing lower antimicrobial susceptibility than their wild-type (WT) strains. Here, we report SCV strains of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), which has been very rarely reported previously. Methods: Two VREF isolates (2014-VREF-113 and 2014-VREF-234) showing SCV phenotype were isolated from rectal swabs of two hospitalized patients. MLST and PFGE were performed for molecular characterization of SCV and WT strains. We compared growth curve, stability of phenotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, and biofilm forming ability between SCV and WT strains. Results: In both VREF strains, MLST and PFGE patterns confirmed that SCV and WT strains were identical. Phenotype switching of 2014-VREF-234 was very stable even after 40 passages, while SCV phenotype of 2014-VREF-113 switched to the WT after 11 passages. There was no significant difference in antimicrobial susceptibility between SCV and WT strains of 2014-VREF-113 and 2014-VREF-234. However, biofilm formation of SCV strain was lower than that of WT in 2014-VREF-234. Conclusion: Two SCV rectal isolates showed the same antimicrobial susceptibility as WT strains. One SCV strain was very stable in multiple passages. Biofilm forming ability was not high in SCV strains and even one SCV showed lower ability than WT strain. All MRSA isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). SCCmec typing and spa typing were performed for all isolates belonging to ST72. Results: Seven different STs were identified: ST5 (66.3%), ST72 (19.6%), ST239 (8.3%), ST254 (3.3%), ST1 (1.3%), ST30 (0.6%) and ST89 (1.3%). Before 2005, the most frequent ST was ST5 (61.6%), followed by ST72 (17.5%) and ST239 (11.6%). Between 2006 and 2008, ST5, ST72 and ST239 accounted for 43.3%, 30% and 23.3%, respectively. After 2011, ST5 and ST72 accounted for 55% and 43.3%, but ST239 accounted for only 1.7%. Among the ST72 MRSA isolates, the most predominant spa type was t324 (57%), followed by t148 (24%) and t664 (19%). Conclusion: Our results show that ST 72 MRSA has become increasingly isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients in Korea, whereas ST239 MRSA has become decreased in prevalence over the past 1.5 decades.",

            "text": "Identification of Helicobacter pylori in water sources in Makassar D. Nurul*, T. Uleng, I. Chaidir, I. Utami. University of Hasanuddin, Makassar, Indonesia Introduction: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative, microaerophilic and spiral shaped bacterium that colonizes the human gastric mucosa. It is known that approximately 50% of the human population have been infected by H. pylori. The colonization of this microorganism is a major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma and mucose-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). The prevalence of H. pylori reached more than 80% in developing countries andup to 22.1% in Indonesia, of which most infected ethnicities in Indonesia are Papua, Batak and Bugis. Previous studies have identified the relationshipbetween the prevalence of H. pylori infections with water sources in the community. Methods: This study is an observational analytic study with a cross sectional study design and purposive sampling technique. In this study, samples were taken from water sources in 14 slum districts in Makassar to find the presence of H. pylori and examined using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The synthesized DNA fragments used as positive control were based on the sequence of glmM gene represented a 294 bp band on electrophoresis gel, whereas distilled water were used as negative control. Results: Among 50 water samples taken in 14 slum districts in Makassar, there were no H. pylori detected byPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Conclusion: We found that there were no contamination of H. pylori in water sources in slum areas in Makassar.

Yadav 2 . 1 University of Delhi, New Delhi, India, 2 Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, India Japanese encephalitis, formerly known as Japanese B encephalitis is a disease caused by the mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The (JEV) itself is a virus from the family Flaviviridae, which is a part of the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex of 9 genetically related viruses, some which are particularly severe in horses, and four known to infect humans including West Nile virus. The mosquitoes Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex vishnui are amongst the most important vectors of this disease. This disease is most prevalent in Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Asia. Japanese encephalitis viral activity has been widespread in India. The first evidence of presence of the virus dates back to 1952. First case was reported in 1955. Outbreaks have been reported from different parts of the country. During recent past (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) , 15 states and Union Territories have reported Japanese encephalitis incidence. Annual incidence ranged between 1,714 and 6,594 and deaths between 367 and 1665.",

Our hospital monitors MRSA acquisition rate by screening patients upon admission and prior to discharge. We noticed a rise in the MRSA acquisition rate in the hospital in February 2016. Method: We screened all patients in the hospital to assess the extent of the situation. Majority of them were from a male ward with 9 out of 17 patients acquiring MRSA in February 2016 during their stay. To establish how the patients acquire MRSA, we performed environmental sampling. We analyzed the positive isolates from patients and environment with Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: The same strain of MRSA was found on 3 patients, 2 curtains and 1 day room chair; another 3 patients and 2 curtains' MRSA were genetically similar from this strain ( Figure 1 ). We emptied the ward for terminal cleaning and stepped up our daily targeted cleaning of high-touch surfaces. Curtains were all changed. Although the number of MRSA colonised patients had decreased in March 2016, there were still 6 patients colonised with MRSA in the ward despite the measures taken. We then took more cultures from the environment. We found that air-cooler filters in the same ward had identical MRSA strains from the first cluster in February 2016 ( Figure 2 ). After thorough cleaning of these filters and the environment again, only 2 patients (at ward's baseline) were found to be colonised in subsequent months. Conclusion: We confirmed the epidemiology link between MRSA colonised patients and hospital environment during a pseudooutbreak using PFGE. In the presence of stringent infection control measures, meticulous cleaning of high-touch surfaces in common areas is crucial in preventing the nosocomial transmission of MRSA via the hospital environment.",

The percentage of clinical students who knew that the antibiotics should be used only for suspected bacterial infections, antibiotics should be started on doctor's prescription, importance of correct duration of antibiotic use and the importance of correct dosage interval of antibiotic use were 100%, 100%, 98.27% and 100% respectively. Significance (p) values of difference between two groups were 0.04, 0.08, 0.148 and 0.08 respectively. Of the 101 pre-clinical students 86 (85.14%) knew that the frequent and inappropriate antibiotic use could lead to development of antibiotic resistance. All the clinical students (100%) knew that frequent and inappropriate use of antibiotics would lead to development of antibiotic resistance (\u03c72 = 9.51, df = 1, p = 0.002). Conclusion: The knowledge relating to use of antibiotics was better among the clinical students in comparison to pre-clinical students. Background: Control and prevention of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission in healthcare remains a significant challenge worldwide. One of the main emphasis is on promoting hand hygiene practices among healthcare workers. However, the role of patients' contacts in nosocomial transmission of MRSA is unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate contact Methods: This was a prospective observational study of 35 MRSApositive patients and 15 MRSA-negative patients admitted to our institution from March to December 2016. All episodes of patientto-patient contact, patient-to-environment contact and hand hygiene practices were observed and recorded. Associations between key exposure variables with contact episodes and hand hygiene practices were analyzed. Results: In all, there were 7 patient-to-patient contact episodes and 3442 environmental contact episodes observed in 289 observation hours. Median contact episodes per subject in patient zone and common healthcare zone were 49 (20-86) and 1.5 (0-6) respectively. Common point of contacts were bedrails, bedside table and toilet door handles. There were no statistical significant differences in contact patterns between MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients. Among patients who were functionally independent or assisted, 57% of MRSA-positive patients had >5 contact episodes in healthcare zone compared to 36% of MRSA-negative patients. Of these, only 38% of MRSA-positive patients performed hand washing compared to 64% among MRSA-negative patients. Conclusion: Direct patient contact and shared environment between patients and infrequent hand hygiene practices among MRSA patients could play a role in nosocomial transmission of MRSA. Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging problem in developed and developing countries. In the Philippines, MDH has been actively joining the global effort to fight AMR since 2013. In this study, we aimed to assess the initial impact of ASP on the prevalence of MDROs and antibiotic consumption measured as defined daily dose. Methodology: Review of surveillance data and antibiotic usage was done from 2011 to 2016. All specimens positive for K. pneumoniae (KPC), E. coli & K. pneumoniae (ESBL), and Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) were examined. Prevalence rate was computed for the MDROs per year. Age, sex and length of hospital stay were gathered. Utilization of Cefepime, Ertapenem, Meropenem, Imipenem, Vancomycin, Pip-Tazo, Levofloxacin, and Ciprofloxacin was computed as DDD/1000 patient-days. Difference between the antibiotic consumption of before and after program implementation was evaluated using T-test. Spearman's correlation was used to test the relationship between resistance and antibiotic use. Results: The mean age of patients was 62. Most of the patients were male (58%). Patients in ICU have a longer length of stay than the patients in the 5A Station. Among the isolated MDROs, 39.71% (135 of 340 isolates) was K. pneumoniae (ESBL+). Pip-Tazo (25.04 DDD/ 1000 patient-days) and Meropenem (13.86 DDD/1000 patientdays) have the highest consumption among the monitored and restricted antibiotics, respectively. There is a strong correlation between the % resistance of E. coli and use of Cefepime (r = 0.7902, P = 0.0022). Conclusion: Increased utilization of Cefepime is correlated with the resistance in E. coli against this agent. Since the ASP was recently implemented, the true impact of ASP may not be evident as of the time of evaluation. Moreover, although subjects with latent TB infection (LTBI) are asymptomatic and are not infectious, they may eventually develop active disease. Thus, the screening and treatment of LTBI is important for a fundamental tool of TB control programs for HCWs. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and epidemiologic characteristics with LTBI among HCWs at a hospital in Seoul, South Korea. Methods: This cross-sectional study of HCWs was conducted between 2016 and 2017. Participants were administered a questionnaire on demographics. We excluded HCWs with history of TB or LTBI treatment in this study. The QuantiFERON \u00ae TB-Gold (QFT) assay was performed for the screening of 740 HCWs who worked at Konkuk University Medical Center in Korea. Epidemiologic risk factors with LTBI were identified by logistic regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of positive QFT was 10.9% (81/740). There was no significant association between risk factors for sex, working in the medical domain and employment type and positive QFT. However, working in medical domain tended to be more positive QFT than working in surgical domain (7.6% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.075, OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.952-2.570). The higher age (\u226540 years old) was significantly associated with positive QFT (OR 3.7, 95% CI 2.682-8.401, P < 0.001). All QFT positive HCWs were referred for chest Xray and examination by pulmonology specialists. None were found to have active TB, and were thus diagnosed with LTBI. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the prevalence of LTBI in HCWs may be relatively high. The risk of LTBI increases with longer working experience. As a result, active serial screening for LTBI is needed for HCWs. Introduction: Improper practices and lack of knowledge by food handlers are contributing factors for the spread of foodborne outbreaks. This study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitude/ practices of food/hand hygiene and observation of hand washing practices among food handlers at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) and the KDU guest house. Methodology: A descriptive cross sectional study was done among 103 food handlers who are involved in food production, possessing, distribution at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University and the KDU guest house. Information gathering method using a pretested validated questionnaire and direct observations were used for the data collection. An association was tested between hand/food hygiene knowledge/attitude and category of service (chefs, cooks, kitchen assistants, waiters and others including food distributing staff ), level of education (completed their primary education up to grade 5, completed GCE O/L and completed their GCE A/L) and duration of service (worked more than 5 years, for 1 to 5 years and for less than 1 year). Results: Of the 103 food handlers, 86.9% had excellent knowledge on food hygiene. Category of service and level of education of food handlers were related with knowledge /attitude of food hygiene ( p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between the knowledge of food hygiene with the duration of service of the employees ( p > 0.05). Knowledge and attitude of hand hygiene was excellent in all the food handlers (>86%) except the knowledge of 8 steps of hand washing techniques ( p > 0.05). Through direct observations, it was observed that food handlers' hand washing practices significantly related with the place of work (KDU and KDU guest house) and category of service (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Most of the food handlers at the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University have good knowledge, attitude and practices regarding food and hand hygiene. Further educational and training programs will be necessary to improve their knowledge attitude and practices of food and hand hygiene. Background: Active surveillance culture of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (ASC-CRE) is recommended in high-risk settings. We aimed to investigate the effect of AST in patients admitted to an intensive care units (ICU) and the risk factors for CRE acquisition. Methods: We prospectively conducted ASC-CRE of rectal swabs for all patients admitted to ICU during a 5.5-month at a tertiary hospital in South Korea. The ASC-CRE was done at admission and was re-tested weekly. ASC-CRE was performed by CDC methods. A PCR assay was performed to detect 5 carbapenemase genes (NDM, KPC, VIM, IMP, OXA). Results: A total of 294 patients were admitted during the study period. CRE acquisition rate was 4.4% (13/294); 46.2% (6/13) were carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). No invasive infection was found. The most common species were Klebsiella pneumoniae (76.9%, 10/13) and 5 KPC and 1 NDM genes were detected. In CRE-positive patients, in-hospital-mortality were higher (P = 0.002). Multivariate analyses showed prior exposure to healthcare facilities (outpatient visits, admission or surgery in the preceding 1 year) (aOR 13.9; 95% CI 1.6-117.1), co-colonization of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (aOR 4.9; 95% CI, 1.3-17.7) and the length of admission to CRE detection \u226510 days (5.6; 95% CI 1.5-20.4) were independently associated with CRE acquisition. Conclusion: Using ASC-CRE, CRE acquisition rate was 4.4%. Prior exposure to healthcare facilities, co-colonization of MDROs and the length of admission to CRE detection \u226510 days were risk factors for CRE acquisition. Background: The national surveillance system has been proved to reduce device-associated infection (DAI) through several studies and many countries have already applied it. Therefore, we investigated to time trend of DAI rates and factors associated with changing trend for 10 years through the Korean National Healthcare-associated Infections Surveillance System (KONIS). Methods: We investigated DAI rates from 2006 through 2015 in 190 KONIS participating intensive care units (ICUs) in 107 hospitals. DAI rates were calculated as numbers of infections per 1,000 devicedays. Data associated with ICU characteristics were collected and mixed linear regression analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: From 2006 to 2015, rate of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) significantly decreased from 3.48 in 2006 to 1.00 in 2015 ( per 1,000 ventilator-days, F = 27.62, p < 0.0001). Also, rates of catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and C-line associated blood stream infection (CLBSI) significantly decreased from 1.85 to 0.88 ( per 1,000 catheter-days, F = 10.14, p < 0.0001) and from 3.40 to 2.20 (per 1,000 catheter-days, F = 14.17, p < 0.0001). In subgroup analysis, rates of VAP, CAUTI and CLBSI were significantly decreased regardless of organizational and institutional characteristics of ICUs. Conclusion: In Korea, all of the DAIs have shown a significant reduction in the last 10 years, that might be associated with participating surveillance in the KONIS. We will need to encourage participation of more hospitals.

International societies recommend institutional antibiograms are helping in better implementation of antibiotic stewardship activities in the hospital. Little is known about how Indian hospitals compelling the antibiograms. The aim of the study was to study describe the key features of hospital antibiogram in South Indian Hospitals. Methods: Using cross-sectional research design, purposive sampling of accredited hospitals across South India was conducted using a structured questionnaire prepared based on latest CLSI antibiogram guidelines. Content validity of survey questionnaire was carried out by infectious disease physician & postdoctoral fellows. Survey questionnaire completed by consenting respondents (infection control team member or microbiology laboratory personnel) through either face-to-face interaction or through telephonic interview were taken for analysis. Data were compiled using descriptive statistics. Results: 18 of the 25 contacted respondents completed the survey. The other parameters surveyed were shown below in Table 1 . contributory. Beginning in July through September 2016, an increase in SSI's in Obstetrics & Gynaecology (OG) was noted. Our aims were to evaluate SSI cases for potential causes and clustering, measure peri-operative antimicrobial appropriateness, develop interventions to reduce SSI, and improve appropriate perioperative antimicrobial use. Methods: Data from SSI cases were collected and described. Subsequently, employing Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) methodology, results were discussed and used to develop interventions together with stakeholders, and structural changes were suggested or implemented. Repeated reviews and changes were performed, and measurable processes were tracked in addition to SSI trends. Results: We confirmed an increase in SSI from baseline of 0.7% to 1.8%. There was no temporal or spatial clustering, but 33% were obese, 97% received peri-operative antibiotics within 60 min of incision, 76% received appropriate type/ dose of antibiotics, 55% received chlorhexidine-alcohol as surgical skin antisepsis, while 75% of obstetric cases occurred >14 days post-operatively, suggesting multiple possible causes. Working with multiple stakeholders, a bundle of 7 interventions were developed as best practices for implementation. We also rectified a 'downtime' form used by junior doctors who were prescribing peri-operative antibiotics erroneously. By end March 2017, total SSI rates had decreased to 0.4% from 1.8% (see Figure 1 ). All SSI patients received timely peri-operative antibiotics, 86% received chlorhexidine-alcohol as surgical skin antisepsis, though only 57% of SSI cases received appropriate type/ dose of peri-operative antibiotics.",

Current epidemiology revealed that there was diversity in distribution of fungal isolates from one centre to another, as it may influence the clinical practice in the management of mycoses. This study was undertaken to describe the distribution of fungal isolates in the new clinical training centre, Malaysia. Ninety-three fungal isolates from 92 specimens were detected on both saboraud dextrose agar and brain heart infusion media from January 2014 to March 2017. Identification of all isolates was performed by assessment of its colonial morphology, microscopy examination and VITEK-2. Majority of the fungi were isolated from nail (n = 32; 34.7%) followed by skin scrapping, blood, bronchioalveolar lavage and tissue biopsy respectively [31 (33.7%), 13 (14.1%), 13 (14.1%) and 3(3.26%)]. Commonly isolated fungi were consists of non-albicans candida followed by Candida albicans, Fusarium spp., Trichophyton spp., Aspergillus spp., Trichosporon spp., and Cladosporium spp. [19; (20.4%), 16 (17.2%), 15 (16.1%), 10 (10.8%), 9 (9.67%), 6 (6.45%), and 5 (5.37%)]. Sporothrix schenkii, Rhizopus spp. and Penicillium spp. contributed 2.15% of each of the isolated fungi while, Verruconis gallopava, Cryptococcus laurentii, Bipolaris spp., Curvularia spp., Acremonium spp., Chaetomium spp., and Microsporum spp. added only 1.07% to the distribution. Candida albicans remains the most common isolated fungi followed by Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton spp. All three isolates were mainly isolated from blood, skin scrapping, and nail. Emphasis on the need to have continuous surveillance regarding distribution of fungal isolates need to be carried out, as these will provide a resourceful information on the commencement of empiric antifungal therapy. The aim of this study was to produce fluconazoleloaded liposomal nanoparticles, to analyze their physicochemical properties and to compare their antifungal effects with the free fluconazole drug in vitro against the fluconazole susceptible and resistant Candida species isolated from patients. Six common candida species including C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, C. krusei and C. guilliermondii were tested. The Liposomal nanoparticles were prepared using thinlayer hydration method and soybean lecithin, cholesterol, and fluconazole at a ratio of 10:1:1.",

The results were analyzed using Student's T-test and indicated the greater antifungal effects of the liposomal nanoparticles containing fluconazole than the normal form of the drug. It was shown that MIC of Fluconazole was put in the range of sensitive species after exposure with the Fluconazole Nanoliposomal in most Fluconazoleresistant Candida species except for the krusei species. Objectives: Candida bloodstream infections (BSIs) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. However, the issue of whether central venous catheters (CVCs) should be removed remains controversial, especially in neutropenic patients.",

CVC removal was preferred in all non-neutropenic patients and in neutropenic patients when the source was presumed to be the CVC or who failed to show Candida clearance from the bloodstream despite appropriate antifungal therapy. Results: Of 40 patients with Candida BSIs, 24 (60%) were neutropenic and 16 (40%) non-neutropenic. Overall, the CVC was removed in 27 (68%) patients at any time points. The CVC was less frequently removed in neutropenic patients than in non-neutropenic patients (54% vs. 88%; P = 0.040). There was no difference in the mortality rates at 6 weeks following CVC removal or CVC retention (33% vs. 54%; P = 0.305). Independent predictors for the 6-week mortality were refractory neutropenia and Pitt bacteremia score. There was no difference of demographic and clinical characteristics between the CVC removal and retention groups. The 6-week mortality in neutropenic patients with Candida BSIs did not differ between the CVC removal and retention groups (54% vs. 55%; P = 1.000). (74) oral Candida isolates collected from T2DM patients in Misrata, Libya were characterised using the VITEK 2 Compact system. Results: Prevalent species included C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. dubliniensis, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. sake, C. kefyr, C. guilliermondii, C. parapsilopsis, C. membranifaciens and C. magnoliae. Drug susceptibility showed an emerging resistance across representatives of all species for which breakpoints were available, with the exception of C. parapsilopsis. Although there are no established interpretative breakpoints for these species, three C. sake isolates and the C. membranifaciens isolate also had high MIC values for fluconazole. The tested isolates were found to be largely susceptible to caspofungin and micafungin. All C. albicans isolates were susceptible to the echinocandins, amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine. Resistance to more than one drug class was seen in C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata and C. krusei isolates. Conclusion: Although the susceptibility results for the echinocandins were encouraging, resistance against the azoles was apparent and should not be ignored. This was especially so in the case of fluconazole, which is often the only locally available antifungal drug for the treatment of disseminated candidiasis. Currently, the live vaccine Toxovax is produced from attenuated variety of Toxoplasma gondii. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunogenicity of live variety of T. gondii which produced through serial passages in cell culture. Twenty-four Balb/C mice were randomly divided into three groups. Group I was the negative control and received cell culture media groups II as positive control and III were inoculated with, acute, and Razi strains of T. gondii, respectively. All mice were assessed daily and potential mortality was recorded. Twenty-eight days later blood sample were collected from all groups for ELISA and then all mice were challenged with injections of acute strain of T. gondii. The results showed that in the control group mortality was started from day 8 and up to14 days after challenge all mice of this group died. The positive control group like the first group 8 days after challenge mortality was started and until the day 18 all mice died. Interesting finding is that the mortality rate was 50% in the third group. These results suggest that the Razi variety of T. gondii caused partially immunity in mice and this variety doesn't cause disease and mortality in mice. The aim of this study was to establish attenuated Neospora caninum (NC-1) tachyzoites through serial passage by J774 cell line. The virulence of attenuated tachyzoites for Balb/c mice were also evaluated. The NC-1 isolates were passage 90 times in J774 cell line to produce high passage or attenuated strain. A total of 35 female BALB/c mice with average age of 6-8 weeks were randomly separated into seven groups. First group as a control was inoculated subcutaneously with cell culture media, the second, third and fourth groups received low passage or acute NC-1 strain with different doses (10 \u00d7 10 6 , 5 \u00d7 10 6 , 20 \u00d7 10 6 ) of tachyzoites. The other three groups inoculated with high passage of NC-1 tachyzoites with similar doses. The mortality rate and pathological changes in all groups were noted daily. The cellular and humoral immunity were assessed by Skin test and ELISA, respectively. The results of the present study showed that mice of the groups that received high passage strain of Nc1 not only survived, but did not show pathological changes of neosporosis. In addition cellular and humoral immune responses to N. caninum were significantly higher in mice that received high passage tachyzoite of NC-1. Background: About 15% of the population in Egypt have chronic hepatitis C and over 90% out of them have HCV genotype 4.

SNP genotyping for interferon lambda-4 (IFN-L4) gene at ss469415590 was performed by taqMan probe assay. RT-PCR for HCV-RNA was carried out at the start and the end of treatment and twelve and twenty four weeks after the end of the treatment. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global concern with an estimated 3.5% of the world population infected. For Malaysia, the national seroprevalence rate of 5% categorises it as a HBV intermediate endemicity country. However, this rate does not represent data from its smallest ethnic minority, indigenous people or Orang Asli. Hence, the objective of this study is to determine the HBV seroprevalence rate among Orang Asli in Malaysia. This is a cross sectional study involving the Negrito, the smallest group out of the three main Orang Asli tribes. This study was conducted in five differently-located Negrito settlements. One hundred and fifty participants were recruited and consented to interview, physical examinations and blood investigation. Sera were tested for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) using the Elecsys\u00ae HBsAg II assay. Demographic data, biological as well as biochemical parameters were eventually analysed using the SPSS version 20 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). There were 13 participants tested positive with HBsAg. This gives an overall HBV prevalence rate of 14.0% (95% CI: 7.0-21.0%). Male to female ratio was almost 2:1, with eight males and five females infected. Majority (77%) of those infected were more than 30 years old. All of them were born to mothers who were not screened for HBV antenatally. Almost half of them (n = 6) had had past history of tattooing and body piercing. In conclusion, HBV prevalence rate among Orang Asli is almost thrice than that of Malaysia national rate, comparable with studies conducted on indigenous population elsewhere. The possible routes of transmission in this population is either through vertical transmission, as well as practices such as tattooing or body piercing. Background: Dengue case in Malaysia is very common and still on the rise. Due to the right climate variability of high temperature and copious rainfalls, addition to human activity towards urbanization, Malaysia has been classified as endemic country for dengue. The monsoon seasons fall between November to March and from June to September each year. Any patients with acute febrile illness with typical or atypical presentation will be diagnosed as suspected dengue until proven otherwise. Our aim of the study is to determine the correlation between the occurrence of suspected dengue cases with the change of climate in an urban area in West Malaysia.",

Background: Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a significant human respiratory pathogen and a common cause of otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. NTHi is capable of forming biofilms, which may be one of the important factors contributing to chronic diseases and accelerating antibiotic resistance. Resistance of bacteria within the biofilms to conventional antimicrobials currently is a major obstacle to effective medical treatment on a global scale. Discovery and development of new agents to effective treatment of NTHi biofilms is therefore necessary and in an urgent need. Methods: In this study, various antimicrobial peptides were synthesized and their anti-biofilm activities against a strong biofilm-forming strain of NTHi were investigated by the microtiter plate biofilm assay.",

Pradidruengchan 3 , P. Jarupach 3 . The antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens of human and animal origin become a main problem of global public health concern. The use of antimicrobial agents in animal hospital increases a selective pressure and a risk of spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria to human in a community. We determined an occurrence of resistant phenotype from routine bacterial culture in a private veterinary hospital in Bangkok between November 2015 to May 2017. A total of 96 Gram negative bacterial isolates from various types of infections in different species of animals were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The antibiogram showed that ampicillin (78%) was the most resistant antibiotic followed by norfloxacin (72%), enrofloxacin (63%) and marbofloxacin (50%). The multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes were shown in all isolates of Acinetobacter baummanii, Escherichia coli (62%), Proteus mirabilis (36%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (55%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%), respectively. Among Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 36% P. mirabilis, 27% K. pneumoniae and 9% E. coli isolates exhibited ESBLs-producing phenotype. The frequency of multidrug-resistant phenotypes and ESBLs-producing phenotype is alarming. Our studies showed the animals in private veterinary hospital as an important reservoir of MDR bacteria. Consequently, the continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in veterinary hospitals is required. Furthermore, major dissemination of these resistant bacteria in a community may be unavoidable, if there is no preventive measure in place. This information will be useful to establish an antimicrobial control policy in animal practice to minimize the emergence of MDR bacteria.

Tuberculosis work-up was negative. The boy used to play football in the mud and swim in the river. The lesions were started as small pustules and then grown in size within 1 month. The abscesses were drainage and treated with a course of levofloxacin unfortunately the lesions persisted. Subfebrile fever was found for 2 months, dry cough in 1 month. He developed pale and decrease body weight in 1 month. Liver and spleen enlargement were found. Pus culture yielded Burkholderia pseudomallei. The patient was treated with ceftazidime and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for 2 weeks and continued with oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for a period of 3 months. The condition was improved significantly and he has been followed up regularly. It has been reported the first case of Melioidosis in North Sumatera, Indonesia.

A 4 year-old boy was presented with fever and cough in July 2016. This patient had been diagnosed with Langerhans cell histiocytosis when he was 20 days old, and had been treated with vinblastine and methotrexate. His blood tests revealed that he had pancytopenia. Blood cultures were positive for Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) serogroup D. All NTS isolates detected in blood (n = 12) and stool (n = 5) specimens, during the 7 episodes of fever or diarrhea observed until May 2017, were identified by the Seoul Research Institute of Public Health and Environment as Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. Initially, the Salmonella infection was treated mainly with ceftriaxone and resolved. The first Salmonella Enteritidis isolate in stool was detected six months after the first detection (January 2017) in blood. The first isolate in July 2016 from blood was susceptible to ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and cotrimoxazole, intermediate to levofloxacin, but resistant to ampicillin. The isolates from blood remained susceptible to 3rd generation cephalosporins, Salmonella isolates started to be detected in stool specimens. The antibiogram of the isolates from blood and those from stool were not identical. The stool isolates were resistant to all drugs tested including the 3rd generation cephalosporin with the exception to levofloxacin. All stool isolates showed synergism using amoxicillin-clavulanate disks and were PCR positive for bla CTX-M , Sequence analysis showed that it is bla CTX-M-79 . The cefotaxime resistance was transferable by conjugation. PFGE of XbaI-digested chromosomal DNA showed all blood isolates have an identical pattern. All four stool isolates had different patterns with 1-3 band difference. In conclusion, repeated isolations of Salmonella Enteritidis with identical PFGE pattern from blood in the immunocompromised patient indicate difficulty in eradication of intracellular Salmonella. As to the Salmonella Enteritidis stool isolates, only 1-3 band difference was noted, suggesting their clonality. The stool isolate with ESBL could have acquired bla CTX-M-79 carrying a plasmid from the intestinal flora.",

Most infections are often self-limiting but severe illnesses do occur in immunocompromised hosts. Rare cases of severe adenovirus pneumonia in immunocompetent adults have been reported with a general poor outcome. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) following adenovirus pneumonia has rarely been described, unlike IPA occurring after influenza infection which is an increasingly recognized entity. Of late, critically ill patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is also deemed to be an emerging risk factor for IPA too.

He needed inotropic support, mechanical ventilation with ECMO. Polymerase chain reaction testing done on endotracheal aspirate sample was positive for adenovirus. Along with broad spectrum antibiotics, he received 12 days of hydrocortisone and 2 cycles of weekly intravenous cidofovir for severe adenovirus pneumonia related ARDS. ECMO was weaned off 18 days later, but he remained ventilator and inotropic dependent 3 weeks into stopping ECMO. Coupled with the increasing inflammatory markers, a computer topography of the chest was done. It revealed an \"air crescent\" sign suggestive of IPA which was confirmed on the fungal culture of the pleural fluid on the ipsilateral side. His clinical status continued to deteriorate despite aspergillosis treatment and demised eventually. Conclusion: IPA should be considered in a non-immunocompromised host in the setting of severe adenovirus pneumonia requiring ECMO support which may be potential risk factors. Reports about Trichosporon fungemia among immunocompetent hosts without malignancy or hematologic disease are extremely rare. Reported was an unexpected fatal case of Trichosporon asahii fungemia due to multiple soft tissue abscesses occurring in immunocompetent patients without any known immunocompromising conditions. A 72-year-old man was admitted to hospital due to painful swelling and febrile sensation on both legs lasting for a week. A CT on lower extremities showed numerous tiny fluid collections and diffuse subcutaneous fat infiltration on both whole legs. During the empirical IV unasyn treatment, the clinical course did not improve. Trichosporon asahii was isolated from 3/3 blood and multiple wound cultures, and IV fluconazole started. Laboratory examinations for detecting hidden autoimmune diseases or hematologic diseases were extensively checked, but any Figure: (abstract P2-CC02) Changes in viral RNA load, IP-10, IFN-\u03b3 and IgG IFA titer timing of therapies. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; SFTSV, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus significant diagnosis was not defined. In spite of orthopedic management and IV antifungal therapy, his condition had not improved and he died due to uncontrolled severe septic shock on 23 rd hospital day. Because Trichosporon species isolates from blood cultures of immunocompetent patients has been considered as contamination, it has been usually considered as meaningless finding by many physicians. However, Trichosporon species can cause a severe fatal infection in the patients without any immunocompromising conditions like this case, great caution might be taken in some clinical situations. A 7-year old boy was referred to pediatrics outpatient clinic with mild fever for one week, abdominal pain, and ultrasonography (US) finding of hepatic subcapsular abscess. Past medical history revealed that he had acute appendicitis two years ago and perihepatic abscess one year ago. US-guided aspiration and culture of the previous liver abscess grew Entercoccus avium and Bacteroides fragilis. Initial laboratory results at our hospital were following; WBC 9,300 \u00d710 3 /\u03bcL (neutrophil 61%, lymphocyte 21%), hemoglobin 11.3 g/dL, platelet 486 \u00d710 3 /\u03bcL, CRP 4.56 mg/dL (0\u223c0.3), total bilirubin 0.3 mg/dL, AST 22 U/L, and ALT 7 U/L. Abdominal CT showed a 4cm-sized thick walled, internal septated abscess on the right posterior perihepatic space without hepatic involvement which was thought to be associated with dropped appendicolith. On hospital day 3, US-guided aspiration and percutaneous abscess drainage was done. Bacteroides fragilis was cultured from the pus and Fusobacterium nucleatum, subscepcies vincetii was also identified via bacterial rDNA identification. The patient was treated with IV Piperacillin/tazobactam for 15 days, metronidazole for 7 days, and PO Amoxicillin/clavulanate for the remaining treatment period of 5 weeks. Abdominal US finding before discharge showed collapsed abscess cavity with 1 \u00d7 0.5 cm sized residual fluid collection and small appendicolith. Hereby, we report a case of a patient with two episodes of perihepatic abscess that may have been associated with secondary infection of retained appendicolith after laparascopic appendectomy. Case: A 71-year-old woman presented the emergency department with fever for 7 days and bilateral flank pain for 2 days. The laboratory results and abdominopelvic computed tomography finding were compatible with APN (Fig. 1a) . Without prior exposure to antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (400 mg intravenously twice a day) was started and gram-negative bacilli were isolated in the initial blood and urine culture on the next day. The subsequent blood culture showed GNB again despite 3-day ciprofloxacin therapy. After the change in antibiotics to ertapenem (1 g intravenously once a day), the patient's clinical course started to improve. ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were identified in all three consecutive blood samples. PFGE patterns, serotypes, and sequence types showed the three isolates were derived from the identical strain (Table 1 ). The MICs of ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method increased from 0.25 to 0.5 mg/L, but remained within the susceptible range. All isolates were resistant to all cephalosporins except ceftazidime while susceptible to carbapenems. The isolates produced CTX-M-14 type ESBL belonging to ST69 clonal group. The failure was attributed to GyrA mutation encoding Ser83Leu within quinolone resistancedetermining regions.",

Case Description: A 63-year-old Singaporean man with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 8.1%) was admitted on 12.12.16 to a Saudi Arabian hospital with symptoms of diarrhoea complicated by acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis support. He then flew back to Singapore on the 22.12.16 and was found unresponsive during flight, requiring admission to the intensive care unit. He spiked a fever on the 15 th day of admission (6.1.17), for which blood cultures grew CRE Klebsiella pneumoniae (see Table 1 ). He was treated with combination of intravenous (IV) meropenem and polymyxin B and then IV tigecycline and polymyxin B. After completion of 2 weeks of antibiotics, he developed fever again. Urine and blood cultures both grew Klebsiella pneumoniae. The isolate was found to express both NDM and OXA type carbapenemases. He continued to have persistent fever despite combination therapy with meropenem and polymyxin B and blood cultures were repeated. Subsequent resistance pattern revealed polymyxin resistance for which MCR-1 was negative. He was started on IV cotrimoxazole, but was changed to IV fosfomycin 6 g Q6H in view of worsening renal function. An US of the abdomen showed a left kidney complex cystic lesion. Radiologically-guided drainage of the abscess was done and cultures grew the same isolate. He was successfully treated with 4 weeks of IV fosfomycin. Repeat imaging at end of therapy showed resolution and he was discharged well. Discussion: CRE infections are hard to treat with limited options and optimal treatment is not clearly defined. Here we report on the successful treatment of a CRE renal abscess with drainage and prolonged course of IV fosfomycin. ",

There was progressively increasing the geographic distribution since the past several decades especially in tropical regions. This virus infection is self-limited and some of patient is life-threatening illness. However, this viral infection still lack of specific treatment, and the vaccine also not fully effective prevention depend on serotypes of virus. Hence, the secondary infection of this virus is important and must be special considered for vaccination in endemic area. In this study, we investigated the distribution of Dengue virus in Southern part of Thailand in epidemic season by collected the 242 serum samples from Dengue patients and performed the detection by nested RT-PCR, to assess the serotype and find out their relationship with clinical presentations. The results presented 12% presented negative results for RNA detection. The 64% of serum sample were positive for Dengue virus serotype 2, and follow by serotype 3, 1 and 4 as 24%, 8% and 4% respectively. Moreover, the patient with dengue shock syndrome was found in cooperatives with Dengue serotype 2% and 0.44% of patient confirmed with secondary infection with present the clinically as warning sign. We anticipate that results will be provided the information about the serotype circulation and clinical correlation of Dengue virus for a wider starting point discussion and consideration to improve the precise diagnosis and also a preventing strategies planning. Background: Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a significant opportunistic pathogen that is involved in severe nosocomial infections. There are also some reports that this bacterium is associated with premature contractions and chorioamnionitis during pregnancy. However, reports associating A. baumannii in causing preterm premature rupture of membrane (PPROM) is limited. In this study, we compared the incidence of A. baumannii in pregnant women with PPROM and those who delivered at term and also, to determine subsequent transmission of the bacterium to their babies. Materials and Methods: Samples consisted of high vaginal swabs from 108 women with PPROM and 110 women with normal pregnancy. For babies (n = 111), swabs were collected from their ears and axillae within six hours of delivery. All the swabs were cultured for A. baumannii on Acinetobacter selective media (CHROMagar) and the suspected colonies were then identified by VITEK \u00ae 2, using ID-GNB card. Results: A. baumannii was isolated from eight (7.54%) mothers with PPROM and eight (7.24%) mothers with normal pregnancy. No significance difference ( p > 0.05) between these two groups were observed. Amongst the PPROM mothers who were A. baumannii colonizers, 50% of them transmitted the bacteria to their babies compared to 25% of those with normal pregnancy. Conclusion: The incidence of A. baumannii colonization in pregnant women is low, regardless whether they have PPROM or not. This suggests that colonization of A. baumannii in pregnant women has no significant role in leading to PPROM and mothers who have PPROM have a high possibility of transmitting the bacterium to their babies. Background: Haemaphysalis longicornis act as the major vector of SFTS virus (SFTSV). Tick bites are the most important risk factor for human infection, transmission of SFTSV from fatal SFTS patient to healthcare workers was possible by blood and respiratory secretion in nosocomial area. Herein, we studied about possible the indolent transmission of SFTSV in patient's asymptomatic family member without tick bite history. Method: We introduced a surveillance of the family members of the SFTS patients from 2016 to June 2017. An epidemiological investigation and blood samples were collected from 9 family members within two weeks after index patient\" SFTS diagnosis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction for molecular analysis was using for diagnosis tool.",

Among the total 9 family cluster, two family cluster (4 family members) had positive results of SFTSV. They were no symptom with SFTS and did not have a history of contact with the blood and body fluid to the index patient. However, they had been staying in the same location within prehospital period. We examined to prove the transmission mode in family members for SFTS virus identification using molecular method from loose stool since 2017, SFTSV was negative from four stool specimens in 2017 SFTS patients. Conclusion: To the our knowledge, this is the first report that the results of the study highlighted a potential secondary infection without tick bite, blood contact, or bloody secretion in the SFTSV endemic area. Although, it is difficult to determine the scope of surveillance due to the SFTS transmission mode remain unclear and evidence for the possibility of droplet transmission remain limited till now, we suggest that standard and droplet precautions are required for family member and direct contact for febrile patients in epidemic period.",

Conclusion: Regional differences in epidemiology of APN were noticed, and the antibiotic usage for treatment of APN was also different by regions in Korea. Methods: Genotyping was performed using the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. The contigs were queried in the Center for Genomic Epidemiology web-based method for MLST (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MLST/) to obtain both allelic profiles and STs. New alleles and allelic profiles were submitted to the online MLST database curator (https://pubmlst.org/cdiphtheriae/).

The gene for 56-kDa type-specific antigen (TSA56) was amplified by nested PCR, and the nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were determined. The nucleotide sequences of the TSA56 obtained from scrub typhus patients and retrieved from the GenBank database were analyzed phylogenetically. Results: In PCR results, 247 PCR-positive samples were obtained and 218 samples (88.3%) showed Boryong genotype by DNA sequence analyses. Thirteen samples (5.3%) showed Taguchi genotype; other Korean types such as Je-cheon (5), Yeo-joo (1) and Pa-joo related strain (1) were also identified. Japanese types such as Karp (4), Kawasaki (2), Ikeda (2) and Nishino (1) were also found. The most cases were found in the group of age 70-79 (29.6%). Conclusion: In our results, the most prevalent type of O. tsutsugamushi was Boryong in Korea, 2016; however, unusual type originated from Korean and Japanese strains were also found. Consecutive and broad-ranged national survey for prevalence is needed for the control and prevention of scrub typhus in other endemic region of Korea. Background: Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a common pathogen in pediatric patients and often causes acute pharyngotonsilitis and skin and soft tissue infection. In addition, bacteremia can also occur. Method: This is a single-center, retrospective study. From January 2000 to December 2016, pediatric patients \u226418 years old with GAS bacteremia were studied. Results: Among 249 patients with positive GAS culture results, 19 patients had GAS bacteremia. Eleven (58%) patients were male and median age was 7.4 years (range 0.3-17.4 years). Fourteen (74%) patients had chronic underlying diseases. Five (26%) were immunocompromised patients. Eight (42%) patients had lymphatic or vascular malformation and seven of them had inflammatory signs of the lesion. Three (16%) patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and presented with only fever without sore throat or other signs of skin and soft tissue infection. Two (10%) patients had underlying chronic kidney disease. Three (16%) patients developed pneumonia and two of them received ventilator care; two patients were previously healthy children and one patient had chronic bedridden condition with microcephaly on home-ventilator care. The 30-day mortality was 6% (1/19). All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin. Fifteen were sensitive to both erythromycin and clindamycin (79%). Conclusion: This study showed various clinical presentations of invasive GAS infections. Although uncommon, GAS should be considered as a potential pathogen that can cause bacteremia and serious clinical course. Background: Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) greatly affects the health and production of pigs and causes significant economic losses in the swine farms. The diseases are commonly associated with bacterial pathogens, and identification of the bacterial pathogens is getting a topic of great interest. In this study, PCR and culture methods were compared to detect five bacterial pathogens mostly associated with PRDC worldwide [Pasteurella multocida (PM), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MH), Streptococcus suis (SS), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), and Haemophilus parasuis (HP)] in lung tissue with pathological lesion. In case of culture method, Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) was used to identify the bacterial species following colony isolation by bacterial culture. Methods: A total of 271 lung samples with pathologic lesion were obtained in two slaughterhouses from December 2015 to July 2016. The tissue was homogenized in 15 mL PBS using a stomacher and genomic DNA was extracted from 1 mL of the homogenized solution after spin down. PCRs were performed with each specific set of primers for a target pathogens using the extracted DNA samples. The homogenized samples were also used to isolate bacteria by streaking onto 10% sheep blood agars followed by overnight culture at 37\u00b0C. Each suspected colony of PM, MH, SS, APP, and HP was subjected to MALDI-TOF assay to identify the bacterial species. Results: Of 271 tissues samples processed, PCR detected all the five pathogens with the highest detection rate of MH (n = 141, 52%) followed by SS (14, 5.1%), HP (5, 1.8%), APP (5, 1.8%), and PM (4, 1.4%), respectively. In contrast, culture method detected only SS (29, 10.7%), PM (29, 10.7%), and APP (1, 0.3%). None of the samples were positive for MH and HP by culture method. All the culture positive samples for the pathogens were negative by PCR except 4 samples of SS positive. When combined the results of PCR and culture methods, the overall prevalence of PRDC associated bacterial pathogens in pathological lung tissues was highest for MH (141, 52%) followed by PM (33, 12.2%), SS (29, 10.7%), APP (6, 2.2%), and HP (5, 1.8%), respectively. Conclusions: PRDC is polymicrobial disease caused by infection of various combinations of primary and secondary bacterial pathogens. It is important to investigate the relevant significance of bacterial pathogens in PRDC to control the disease. MH was the most prevalent bacterial pathogen in this study, indicating MH is the most significant bacterial pathogen of PRDC in Korea. PM and SS were the second and third prevalent bacterial pathogens, but APP and HP were rarely associated with PRDC. The two detection methods used in the current study showed clearly different sensitivities to each pathogen. MH and HP were detected only by PCR but most PM and SS were identified by culture method followed by MALDI-TOF assay. Moreover, PCR and culture methods detected each different portion of positive samples, respectively, in this study. Therefore, use of combinational method of PCR and culture might be useful to increase the sensitivity for the detection of PRDC associated bacterial pathogens. The obligate intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). This bacterium is a tick-borne pathogen mainly transmitted by Ixodes ticks that infect domestic mammals and humans. Molecular characterization of the MSP2/P44 protein of A. phagocytophilum may determine not only if the bacterium is capable of invading hosts but also whether it generates antigenic variation for the purpose of escaping the host immune response, resulting in various pathologic injuries and serious clinical outcomes. In Korea, HGA patients usually present acute fever, muscle pain and headache. In this study, we confirmed seropositivity and/or seroconversion against A. phagocytophilum infection using indirect immuno-fluorescent antibody assay (IFA) from 4 patients with acute fever. We also amplified, cloned and sequenced the part of A. phagocytophilum msp2/p44 genes detected from the HGA patients and then compared them with the msp2/p44 sequences available in GenBank. The comparative data showed that the 4 msp2/p44 sequences obtained from Korean patients had a high similarity (99.17\u223c97.92%) with one another whereas were significantly different with sequences detected from humans in USA (NC007797, DQ519522 and JQ599137) and China (KC128828 and KC430393) . This result provides a clue to understand the distinct genetic characterization of A. phagocytophilum originated from Korean patients, which might be relevant to clinical outcomes might have suggest helpful information on them. Further study is needed to understand a mechanism on escaping the host immune response through molecular characterization of the MSP2/P44 protein. Results: Pathogens were identified in 22 (56%) of the 39 blood, liver aspirate, and/or vitreous humor samples. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent organism (12/39, 33%). Candida was next common (8.3%, 3/39). The most common combined infection was liver abscess (16/39, 41%). And, renal abscess or acute pyelonephritis was in 30.8% (12/39). Two died due to this fulminant infection. Final ocular outcomes were 35.9% (14/39) in NLP, 15.4% (6/39) LP, 15.4% (6/39) HM, 7.7% (3/39) FC, and 25.6% (10/39). K. pneumoniae is a poor prognosis factor for ocular outcome (NLP and LP vs. HM, CF, and 20/200 or better) in the univariate analysis ( p = 0.02). Other factors did not reach to the statistical difference. Tree decision analysis also revealed K. pneumoniae as a node to divide outcome ( p = 0.017). Conclusions: K. pneumoniae is the most frequent pathogen of EE and additionally, seems a poor prognostic factor of ocular outcome. Considering the rapid progression and poor prognosis of EE, early diagnosis and immediate management are vital, especially if K. pneumoniae is identified or suspected.

            "text": "Background: The predominant causative pathogens for bacterial endocarditis in nearly 80% of cases continues to be Gram positive bacteria. The emergence of newer risk factors such as prolonged hospitalization, device insertion and escalating antimicrobial resistance has changed the epidemiology of the disease in the developing world. The incidence of Gram-negative endocarditis in the developed world ranges from 1.3% to 10%, mostly with HACEK (Haemophilus species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens and Kingella species) organisms. Objective: This study was conducted at a 600-bed tertiary care hospital in South India to review the changing epidemiology and risk factors of non-HACEK Gram-negative bacillus endocarditis. Method: Patient records from January 2010 to December2015 (6 years) with Infective endocarditis (IE) as per modified Duke criteria were analysed retrospectively. Results: A total of 120 cases of definitive IE were analysed (103 native vale and 17 prosthetic valve). In the 71 (59.1%) patients with positive cultures, 60 (85%) were gram positive pathogen. Streptococcus sp were the commonest bacteria isolated in 15.8%. Gram negative bacteria were seen in 11(9.1%)-9 native valve and 2 prosthetic valve. Escherichia coli (7 patients [63%]) was the commonest pathogen, 80% were Extended spectrum betalactamase producers. In majority of patients urinary tract was the most common portal of entry (9/11) and nosocomial infections, particularly dialysis related central venous catheter infections. Septic embolic complications were seen in 6 (54%). Conclusion: Non -HACEK gram-negative bacilli are relatively rare causes of endocarditis. Epidemiology and risk factors for developing gram-negative endocarditis including multidrug resistant pathogens are emerging. Health care contact is a primary risk factor for acquisition of non-HACEK endocarditis. Pacific region. The aim of present study is to evaluate microbiological difference of urinary tract infection by hypervirulent phenotype compared to liver abscess origin. Methods: The study was performed on 68 K. pneumoniae isolates from patients with community acquired urinary tract infection (n = 34) and liver abscess (n = 34) who were diagnosed at Keimyung university dongsan medical center from January 2014 through July 2016. The hypermucoviscous phenotype was confirmed with string test. Capsular serotypes, rmpA, magA, kfu, allS and iutA were identified using specific primers by polymerase chain reaction. We compared antimicrobial susceptibility and virulence factors according to origin. Results: Hypermucoviscous phenotype and serotype K/K2 were less in urinary tract infection than liver abscess. Among virulence factors, rmpA, magA, allS and iutA were less frequently observed in urinary tract infection. In the subgroup analysis of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae, serotype K1/K2, rmpA, magA and iutA were less observed in urinary tract infection. identified and scores assigned as follows: 1 point to temperature \u226538.5\u00b0C, neutrophils \u226510 \u00d7 10 9 /L, neutrophils \u226579%, LS of 1, CRP \u226550 to <150 mg/L and Urea \u22658.6 mmol/L; 2 points to neutrophilmonocyte (NM) ratio \u226550 to <100, LS of 2, CRP \u2265150 mg/L and PCT \u22650.25 ng/mL; 3 points to NM ratio \u2265100 and LS of 3.

Background: Rickettsia and Orientia species are gram negative, strictly intracellular bacilli that multiply within the cytosol endothelial cells. Scrub typhus is a mite-borne disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi infection. It occurs frequently during autumn of Korea and the incidence of the disease showed tendency to increase with climate change and outdoor activity. Rickettsia typhi, a typhus group rickettsia, is the etiologic agent of murine or endemic typhus. R. typhi is transmitted to human primarily by the rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, although lice and mites are also potential vectors. In Korea, about 8,000 cases of Scrub typhus have been reported since the first case reported in the 1950s. However, Murine typhus has been reported about 30 cases. Through surveillance study, we obtained basic data of Scrub typhus and Murine typhus for prevention and control in highrisk population. Materials and Methods: This study was performed for national park workers considered as a high-risk population of Rickettsia disease. The eligible participants were 763 (36.9%) out of 2,067 forestry workers. The sera were collected and then the antibodies specific to O. tsutsugamushi and R. typhi were titrated using indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA). 1:256 in IgG or 1:16 in IgM was considered as a single cut-off titer for seroprevalence. Results: The seroprevalence rate was indicated as higher titer than the single cut-off and seroreactivity rate was indicated any titration to the single cut-off. Scrub typhus was showed 4.8% (37/763) and 10.0% (76/763), respectively. And Murine typhus was showed 3.0% (23/763) and 8.9% (68/763) respectively. Moreover, seroprevalence of Scrub typhus and Murine typhus was 0.5% (4/763).",

Background: Age is a known negative predictor for immune recovery following highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The non-linear association has not been well-characterised. Methods: We collected longitudinal clinical data (1985-2014) from a HIV specialist clinic in Hong Kong. We used CD4, CD8 and CD4/ CD8 ratio to examine the immune recovery of Chinese patients who had been on HAART for \u22654 years. Three age categories at HAART initiation were defined: young adults (18-49), middle-aged (50-64) and elderly (\u226565). Late HAART initiation was defined as pre-HAART CD4 \u2264100/\u03bcL or AIDS diagnosis. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyse the association of age category with the temporal change of clinical immune outcome markers from month \u22122 to 60. Results: A total of 913 patients (87% male) were analysed. At HAART initiation, 81% were young adults, 14% middle-aged and 5% elderly. The baseline median CD4, CD8 and CD4/CD8 ratio were 128/\u03bcL (IQR = 36-204/\u03bcL), 704/\u03bcL (IQR = 447-1,038/\u03bcL) and 0.15 (IQR = 0.07-0.25) respectively. Middle-aged were more likely be in late HAART initiation than young adults (OR = 1.55), but were similar to elderly (OR = 1.38).

            "text": "Results: All 23 patients diagnosed with Acute HIV infection were male and the median age at the time of diagnosis was 33 . The median value of Log 10 HIV viral load by RNA RT-PCT at the time of diagnosis was 5.6 and the median CD4 count was 505/\u03bcL. Patients with acute HIV infection most commonly had fever (100%) and (mean duration 8.5 days), followed by gastrointestinal symptoms (83%, nausea and vomiting 52%, diarrhea 44%) and tonsillar enlargement (48%). Leukopenia (WBC count <4,000/\u03bcL) and thrombocytopenia (Platelet count < 150,000/\u03bcL) were present 74% and 70%. Methods: Reviewed retrospectively were the medical records of 388 HIV-infected patients, who had been treated with HAART in a single tertiary hospital since 1 January, 2012. Hyperlactatemia was defined as serum lactate >2.0 mmol/L. Factors were analyzed through comparison between the group showing increment of serum LA level (group 1) and the control group that showed normal or decreased serum LA level (group 2). Results: Among 189 cases were included, 70 cases (group 1) showed increase of LA during HAART (range 2.0-5.1 mmol/L). There was no difference in the distribution of HAART regimen between two groups ( p = 0.338), and according to the NRTI used in HAART between group 1 and group 2 ( p = 0.446). There was no difference in underlying diseases such as co-infections, metabolic diseases and psychiatric diseases between two groups. However, initial serum albumin (4.7 g/dL vs. 4.6 g/dL in group 1 vs. group 2, p = 0.020) and hemoglobin level (14.8 g/dL vs. 14.3 g/dL in group 1 vs. group 2, p = 0.012) showed a statistically significant difference. Increment of CD4+ T cell count ( Background: Advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can have copious opportunistic infections and HIV related cancers, the relative risk is much higher compared with the general population. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of those diseases, it can involve both lymph nodes and extranodal site, but lung involvement is very unusual. Case report: We report a case of pulmonary DLBCL combined with multiple infections in a 43-year-old HIV positive man, presenting with bizarre cystic radiologic findings, whose main symptoms were general weakness and 10 kg weight loss for two months with chronic cough. He was diagnosed with advanced HIV infection, with a CD4 count of 6. The chest radiologic findings identified multifocal septated cystic lesions with thin wall in both upper lungs adjacent to normal parenchyme. The lesions were likely to be in varying states of cystic and necrotic change. As the chest radiologic findings were atypical and clinical signs were unclear, video assisted thoracostomy (VATS) biopsy was conducted for the sake of prompt diagnosis. Its histopathologic finding demonstrated both DLBCL with positive EBV infection and pneumocystis jirovercii (PCP) infection. Mycobacterium avium was also isolated in the AFB culture test. Although chemotherapy could not be performed because of his poor general condition, antiretroviral therapy was started successfully after a few weeks treatment of anti-mycobacterial antibiotics and PCP. His general condition became better and his infectious diseases are under control now. Conclusion: This is the case of pulmonary DLBCL with multiple infections which showed atypical chest radiologic patterns in an advanced HIV patient. Early VATS biopsy was also helpful to have early diagnosis. Background: In May 2015, the 68th World Health Assembly adopted the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR), which reflected the global consensus that AMR threatens human health. Accordingly, the WHO has developed the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) to promote standardized AMR surveillance globally. The goal of GLASS is to enable standardized, comparable and validated data on AMR to be collected, analyzed and shared with countries. Since May 2016, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established the AMR surveillance system for general hospitals in six large cities and provinces in Korea, which is compatible with GLASS of WHO and named it Kor-GLASS. From the defined specimens (blood, urine, feces, urethral and cervical swabs), the priority pathogens are isolated, and the antimicrobial susceptibility of all the priority pathogens is determined.",

            "text": "P2-OT04 Implementation of inter-sectorial \"One Health\" antimicrobial resistance (AMR) containment programme in Malaysia Background: The incidence of AMR is increasing around the world and is affecting all levels of society, thus making AMR a global health threat. AMR is a complex epidemiological problem due to the fact that various causal factors are intertwined. Methods: The Ministry of Health (MOH) Malaysia has taken steps to combat AMR by initiating measures within MOH as well as intersectorally through the One Health approach. In 2016, the MOH steered the initiatives of One Health approach to combat AMR involving various sectors from both human and animal health. This started with the drafting of the Malaysia Action Plan on AMR, focusing on four priority areas which consist of education and awareness; surveillance and research; infection prevention and control; and appropriate use of antimicrobials. At the same time, the National AMR Committee (NARC) was established as a coordinating body to govern the containment activities and its implementation. Under the NARC framework, there are four technical working groups responsible for implementing the planned strategies. Results: Malaysia has successfully established an inter-sectorial One Health AMR framework which governs containment activities as set in the Malaysia Action Plan on AMR. This steering committee is supported by four technical working groups responsible for executing the strategies under their respective priority areas. One of the main outcomes is the implementation of the Integrated One Health AMR Surveillance. Conclusion: AMR is becoming an increasingly urgent challenge and a public health threat for Malaysia. Inter-sectorial collaboration is needed to share evidence on the trends of AMR and the use of antimicrobials in all the related sectors. Awareness and education, infection prevention and control and the antimicrobial stewardship programme will be the driving force to contain AMR. The success of these measures can only be achieved through One Health approach. Background: Cancer is the main cause of death in the developed countries. There are some scientific evidences indicating that parasitic infections induce antitumor activity against certain types of cancers. Hydatid cyst is the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus, that causes hydatidosis in human and livestock. In this study, the effects of alive hydatid cyst protoscolices on Melanoma tumor in C57/black mice was investigated. Materials and Methods: In this investigation two groups of mice were challenged with B16F10 Melanoma cells. After 2 weeks one group was injected with 500 alive protoscolices as case group and the next group left intact as control group. Tumor size in the case and control groups was measured and the data were analyzed using SPSS software and one-way Anova test. Result: our results demonstrated that alive protoscolices of hydatid cyst inhibit melanoma tumor growth in the case group and difference between mean size of tumor in case and control group was statistically significant. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that injection of alive protoscolices of hydatid cyst had significant effect on melanoma tumor growth. Backgrounds: Deep-seawater (DSW) contains several minerals beneficial for human bodies. The effect of DSW has been known to improve specific immune functions. The beneficial effects of DSW suggest that it could be used for development of new health functional foods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate microbiological food safety of meat products processed with DSW. Materials and Methods: Concentrated DSW (CDSW) containing 5.6% salt was used. Bacterial killing activity was measured against E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium DT104, and S. enteritis, respectively, by incubating the bacteria in CDSW or 0.85% saline (control) at 4\u00b0C, and measuring viable bacteria after 24 and 72 h. Two different pork sausages were produced using traditional curing solution or CDSW. Bacterial contamination in the sausages was measured at different time points. Result: The bacterial survival in CDSW and control saline was assessed by measuring colony forming unit (CFU) at different time points. The survival rates of three tested bacteria were more rapidly decreased in CDSW than in control solution. In the bacterial contamination study, no bacteria was detected in either of traditional or CDSW sausages at day 0 and 10. Conclusion: DSW showed some degree of bacterial killing activity, and pork sausages made with DSW showed no bacterial contamination and kept sterile condition until 10 day post production. The contamination study is now in progress to extend the time points being measured. The result indicates DSW could be used for an alternative curing solution in processing meat products. Background: Sitafloxacin exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum and excellent antimicrobial activity against common bacterial pathogens causing different infections. Sitafloxacin has also exhibited excellent clinical efficacy in patients who had failed to respond to other antibacterial therapy. However, sitafloxacin has not been available in Vietnam yet, so that the local information of the in-vitro spectrum of this antibiotic to the most common bacterial pathogens isolated from Vietnam is very necessary to help the doctor having more choice to against the existing situation of antibiotic resistance in Viet Nam. Main aims of the study: Using the microdilution method to determine ratio of sensitivity and the MIC 90 of Sitafloxacin and other common used antibiotics against the most common bacterial pathogens isolated from the clinical samples collected from patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections and with acute urinary tract infections. Objects and methods: The objectives of the study are the bacterial pathogens isolated from sputum including S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii; and from the urine including E. coli, P. mirabilis, E. faecalis, E. faecium, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. For each pathogen, at least 30 isolates are collected. The isolates are collected from different hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City and in Ha Noi for one year (2015). The determination of the MIC of the antibiotics against the bacterial pathogens were carried out by the broth microdilution method following CLSI 2015. To carry-out the MIC, the plates with 96 wells containing the dry antibiotics with serial concentration custom fabricated and supplied by Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd. (Dry Plate Eiken, Tokyo, Japan) were used. Results and discussion: From 1/2015 to 12/2015, 682 isolates were collected from 4 hospitals in Ho Chi Minh and 1 hospital in Ha Noi including 457 isolates from lower respiratory tract infection and 225 isolates from urinary tract. The received results demonstrated that 100% of H. influenzae were sensitive to sitafloxacin, equivalent to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and imipenem, however sitafloxacin gave the very low MIC 90 , only 0.12 \u00b5g/ ml, the lowest versus other antibiotics. Against S. pneumoniae, 100% of the isolates were sensitive to sitafloxacin and the MIC 90 was 0.06 \u00b5g/ml, the lowest versus other antibiotics. Sitafloxacin was among the antibiotics with very high sensitivity ratio to M. catarrhalis (96.2%) and gave the lowest MIC 90 0.12 \u00b5g/ml. Against the cocci Gram [+] like MRSA, MSSA, E. faecalis and E. faecium, sitafloxacin gave the very high sensitivity ratio, equivalent to vancomycin (MSSA) or only after vancomycin (MRSA, E. faecalis, E. faecium), however in most of the cases, higher than the sensitivity ratio of the other antibiotics. Against A. baumannii, sitafloxacin gave the sensitivity ratio 97.6%, over all other antibiotics that its sensitivity ratio was not over 25%. Against P. aeruginosa, sitafloxacin gave the same results, the sensitivity ratio (80.7%) were highest compare to other antibiotics. Against ESBL [+] E. coli, sitafloxacin gave the sensitivity ratio 95.1%, only after meropenem (100%), and over all other antibiotics. Against ESBL [+] K. pneumoniae, although the sensitivity ratio could reach only 46.9%, however this ratio was only lower than meropenem (59.4%) but higher that other antibiotics (most gave the sensitivity ratio not over than 25%). Against E. coli and K. pneumoniae ESBL [-] , as well as Proteus spp., sitafloxacin was among the antibiotics with the highest sensitivity ratio. Conclusions: This is the first trial to find-out the in-vitro activity of Sitafloxacin against the different bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical samples in Viet Nam. The results collected from the study demonstrated that Sitafloxacin exhibited excellent in-vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that are mostly encountered in the clinical fields of infections. This result can confirm that Sitafloxacin can be considered as one of the most powerful antibiotics that doctor can use to treat various infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the levels of coagulation factors and presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in patients with scrub typhus. We included patients confirmed to have scrub typhus at the Chosun University Hospital between September 2004 and December 2009. The DIC scores were evaluated in 365 patients and 36 healthy controls. The median concentrations of fibrinogen, D-dimer, and fibrin/ fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) were compared between patients and healthy controls ( p < 0.001 for all tests). Patients with scrub typhus had longer prothrombin time and lower platelet counts than the controls. Major bleeding was observed in 18/365 patients with scrub typhus. Fifty-one (14.0%) patients presented with severe complications of scrub typhus. Overt DIC and thrombocytopenia (<100,000 platelets/mm 3 ) were observed more frequently in patients with bleeding and severe illness. Furthermore, median platelet counts were low in both groups. Approximately 2.7% (n = 10) and 16.4% (n = 60) patients with scrub typhus had overt DIC, as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis DIC score (DIC1) and the DIC-scoring template with a fibrinogen/C-reactive protein-ratio (DIC2), respectively. Three (16.7%) and 10 (55.6%) patients with bleeding had overt DIC, as defined by the DIC1 and DIC2, respectively. Seven (13.7%) and 26 (51%) patients with severe illness had overt DIC, as defined by DIC1 and DIC2, respectively. In conclusion, activation of the coagulation system is an important feature of scrub typhus and is correlated with severe disease, including bleeding. This is the first study to report a relationship between DIC and scrub typhus. Background: Quality manuscript editing is necessary for publication in international medical journals, especially for non-native English-speakers. External editing services (EES) are popular, but authors are often unsatisfied with the cost, timeliness, and quality of the services. As a result, our institution launched an in-house editing service (IHES) that works closely with authors to more personally meet their needs. Methods: We designed a survey to monitor author satisfaction and compared preliminary data from one survey item to corresponding results for EES used by our institution in the past year. Authors rated our IHES using a 5-point Likert scale to answer the following questions: (1) Was the request finished in a timely manner? (2) Did the editor fully comprehend the manuscript? (3) Did the corrections correspond with your intentions? (4) How many additional corrections did you make? (5) Was 1:1 consulting helpful? (6) How would you rate your overall satisfaction with this service? (7) Was this your first time using this team's service? (8) Was this your first time using any editing service? (9) How would you rate your relative satisfactory rate compared to other services? (10) Would you use this service again? (11) Would you recommend this service to your peers? Results: The overall satisfactory rate for our IHES was 4.72\u00b10.50 (mean\u00b1SD). For question #2, our IHES scored 4.80\u00b10.54, which was significantly higher than corresponding results from another survey evaluating 6 EES (mean, 3.98\u00b1SD; range of means, 3.74-4.60; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Authors were highly satisfied with our newlyestablished IHES, and they deemed our editors as having fuller comprehension of their manuscripts than did the EES editors. Background: In Singapore, there are currently two routes to pursue a career as a Medical Technologist (MT) via Bachelor Degree in Biomedical Science or its equivalent from two local universities or Science-related Diploma/Special Diploma from any the five Polytechnics. Academic training covers the core disciplines in laboratory medicine (e.g. Haematology, Clinical Chemistry, Medical Microbiology, Transfusion Medicine and Cyto-Histopathology). Students passed theoretical examinations and completed practical placement in a working laboratory are deemed competent as MT. This report summarises the academic training of the Microbiology MT. Method: Typically Microbiology discipline involves many manual processes from culture plating to recognising, identifying potential pathogen and their susceptibility to antibiotic. Today bench Microbiology MT needs to acquire skills and knowledge on automation; walk-away sample plating and automated identification and susceptibility testing system. Learn newer mass spectrometry technique that allows bacteria identification with reduction in turnaround time (TAT) to minutes. Acquire molecular technique to improve TAT, sensitivity and specificity. Develop medical informatics and process algorithm for management, process control, decision making on scientific analysis, expert reporting of antibiotics, antibiotic stewardship support and accurate reflex testing. Emphasis in quality management and quality control plan are essential. Continuous skills and knowledge improvement to maintain competency and currency in Microbiology is crucial. Result: Current academic programs need to provide the necessary professional development for relevancy of dynamic changes in today's laboratory services. It has been long-debated whether multiple sputum specimens, three to be exact, are absolutely required for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis. Studies from high TB burden country have shown that it can be diagnosed effectively using only two specimens. However, researchers in low TB burden countries have presented contradictory findings. This study was set out to evaluate the optimum number of sputa required to diagnose TB by acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy, in a moderate TB burden country such as Malaysia. We retrospectively reviewed acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear Kinyoun stain microscopy result of three consecutive sputum specimens from 31 culture-confirmed TB patients. This cohort of patients includes all inpatients and outpatients presented from 2011 to 2015. HIV patients and foreigners originally from high, or low, TB burden countries were excluded. The data of 31 AFB positive patients were eventually analysed. Twenty-six of those (83%) were successfully diagnosed based on their first sputum. Twenty-nine patients (94%) were AFB positive based either on first sputum only, second sputum only or both. This meant that collecting two consecutive specimens improves AFB detection by about 10%. Finally, two patients (6%) required third sputum examination to eventually clinch their diagnosis. Overall, the third sputum did not appear to have significant additional diagnostic value for AFB detection by microscopy. We concluded that examining only two sputum specimens is sufficient for an effective diagnosis in a moderate TB burden country. It also lessen the financial implication to both patient and healthcare system, to the latter by decreasing laboratory workload and shortening the period of mandatory TB isolation for smear-negative patient. Background: Rapid differentiation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is important for early and effective treatment. MPT64 is a MTBC specific antigen secreted during bacterial growth, which has been shown to be an excellent target for differentiating MTBC from NTM. In this study, we investigated the frequency of MPT64 Ag negative and IS6110 PCR positive MTBC strains isolated from clinical specimens in Korea. Methods: January 2014 to December 2016, AFB cultures were performed on clinical specimens using 2% Ogawa medium and BACTEC MGIT 960 System (BD Diagnostics, USA). AFB staining and MPT64 Ag assay were performed on cultured strains. For MPT64 Ag negative strains, IS6110 PCR was performed. The first strain of the multiple isolates from the same patient was included in this study. Results: Of the 5,749 AFB culture positive specimens, MPT64 positive strains were 3,586. Of the 2,163 MPT64 negative strains, 129 (6.0%) were IS6110 PCR positive strains. Of the 3,669 cases reported in MTBC, 92 cases (2.5%) was MPT64 negative strains and among the 46 cases reported in mixed growth (MTBC and NTM), 37 cases (80.4%) was MPT64 negative. Conclusions: The prevalence of MPT64 Ag negative and IS6110 PCR positive MTBC strains isolated from the clinical samples in the last 3 years in Korea were 3.5% (129/3,715) . Of MTBC strains mixed growth with NTM, 80.4% (37/46) was MPT64 negative. The false negativity may be attributed to the lower concentration of MPT64 protein and could also be explained by the deletion and mutation in the mpt64 gene. In this study, mpt64 gene PCR and sequencing was not performed. A negative MPT64 assay cannot exclude the diagnosis of tuberculosis. For MPT64 negative isolates, conventional or molecular tests are required to confirm the presence of MTBC.",

            "text": "Neonatal splenic and hepatic tuberculosis: case report and review of the literature Z. Yang 1 . 1 Beijing Children Hospital, China (P.R.C) Background: Congenital tuberculosis is rare, even where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic. A 13-day-old girl presented with a 6-day history of fever, originally the infant abdominal ultrasound showed multiple nodes in liver and spleen after 3weeks antibiotic therapy, including using linezolid in venous for 2 weeks the nodes decreased but did not disminished then the linezolid was changed to orallyadministrated sequential therapy, but fever recurrence and neurological symptoms appeared after discharging for 1week. Her mother was asymptomatic, and her chest radiograph didn't show any evidence of TB infection like bilateral miliary nodules. PPD test was negative. But finally diagnosed with a TB infection by a positive T-SPOT. Congenital TB was strongly suspected because of the symptoms, signs and maternal TB history, and was confirmed by T-SPOT. Timely administration of standard anti-TB therapy combined linezolid resulted in a good outcome of the patient. The case highlights the importance of differential diagnoses of splenic and hepatic tuberculosis and linezolid for neonatal TB may facilitates treatment and the prognosis,but cannot be single used. Case Presentation: We reported a complicated case of congenital TB. A 13-day-old girl presented to the Department of Pediatrics\" Emergency Room, Beijing Children's Hospital (BCH), Linkou with fever of 6 days\" duration. She was the second child of a 22-year-old woman and had been born in local hospital by Caesarean section at 37 weeks gestation weighing 2,600 g. Her temperature was 37.2\u00b0C and Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. On admission, she weighed 2,380 g and her temperature was 38.8\u00b0C, pulse 166 beats/minute, blood pressure 82/64 mm Hg and respiratory rate 38 breaths/minute. Chest wall retraction and coarse breath sounds were present. The remainder of the physical examination was normal. There was no cyanosis, lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Previously, the infant's mother had been healthy with no history of TB contact. Conclusion: Through this case, we aimed to emphasize the importance of including Congenital tuberculosis in the differential diagnosis when a young infant admit with fever no reason and abdominal ultrasound show disseminated hepatic and Splenic nodal, and linezolid can be useful in treatment of Congenital tuberculosis. but it can not be single used and its course is on controversy. makes early recognition crucial and life-saving. Results of TB patients seen at Faculty of Medicine UiTM in between January 2011 to December 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. All culture and sensitivity test results performed using BD BACTEC MGIT 960 SIRE system was included. Culture results without comprehensive susceptibility pattern were excluded. First line drugs included for the data were streptomycin (STR), isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF) and ethambutol (ETH). A total of sixty-seven positive results for MTB culture and sensitivity were obtained. Sixty-two isolates (92.5%) were sensitive to all four antimycobacterials tested. Four isolates (6%) demonstrated mono-resistant susceptibility pattern; two were RIF-monoresistant, one were INHmonoresistant and the other one, ETH-monoresistant. One isolate (1.5%) were found to be resistant against two drugs, isoniazid and streptomycin. Over 90% of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated in this centre was sensitive to four first line drugs tested. Although five isolates were resistant to either one or two antimycobacterials, none of those were resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. This meant that MDR-TB was not present in this particular cohort of patients. Still, efforts should be made to ensure that these drugsusceptible patients do not develop MDR-TB in future. Comparison of results is difficult while standardisation of results is a challenge. Methods: We examined the performance of 3 different loci sets for genotyping 52 MTB isolates collected over a 2-year period from a large regional hospital in Hong Kong, an intermediate TB-burden area. Results were compared for lineage classification into Beijing (40) and non-Beijing(12) genotypes, and for epidemiological correlations. Results: Both MIRU-15 and 24 resolved to identify clearly distributed clusters. MIRU-12 presented incorrect relationship between Beijing and non-Beijing genotypes, and mixed up different lineages in the same cluster. MIRU-24 misinterpreted 1 non-Beijing cluster within 2 Beijing clusters. Epidemiological linkage within MIRU-15 and MIRU-24 clusters confirmed similar linkages between isolates. With MIRU-12, however, a few isolates showed incorrect linkages. Overall, MIRU-15 displayed more accurate differentiation when compared with MIRU-12 and 24. Conclusion: Our results showed that excessive or insufficient number of loci may reduce resolution of epidemiological links and clustering. In our experience, the 15-loci set for MIRU-VNTR outperforms the other two sets if used for routine genotyping. Although MIRU-15 is sufficient for simple clustering analysis, lineage classification and epidemiological linkages would need to be considered. Multiple methods and increase in number of highly variable loci may be indicated in order to achieve optimal specificity.",

            "text": "Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, spore forming anaerobic human pathogen. C. difficile infection (CDI) is a worldwide health concern with disease symptoms ranging from diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and in some cases toxic megacolon, sepsis or death. CDI usually occur as a result of intestinal dysbiosis and exposure to C. difficile spores. Current treatment strategies rely on antibiotic usage which can often result in high recurrence rates and might increase the risk of developing antibiotic resistant strains. Previous researches have demonstrated that many medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) can inhibit the growth of multiple human bacterial pathogens. Consequently, we hypothesized that these MCFAs might also present a potential inhibitory effect against C. difficile. Here we showed that lauric acid have potent antimicrobial activities against multiple toxigenic C. difficile isolates while presenting low cytotoxicity to human colon epithelial cells. The mechanisms of inhibition are due partly to the generation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell membrane damage. Biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilm were also significantly reduced by the addition of lauric acid in a dose-dependent manner. In murine infection model, lauric acid pre-treatment lessened CDI symptoms and reduced proinflammatory cytokine production. Taken together, we have demonstrated the naturally occurring MCFA lauric acid as a novel C. difficile inhibitor which could be used as an alternative treatment for CDI. Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are potent and broad-spectrum antibiotics commonly used to treat severe or resistant bacterial infections. However, FQ resistance to gram-positive and -negative bacteria has emerged easily and increased globally. The mechanism for FQ resistance is known to be multifactorial, including one or more mutations in their target genes encoding DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Since the therapeutic choice against FQ-resistant bacterial infections becomes limited, it would be necessary to develop novel antibiotic alternatives to minimize or inhibit FQ resistant bacteria. In this study, we examined possible bactericidal effect of antisense peptide-peptide nucleic acids (P-PNAs) which were able to block the expression of DNA gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV in FQ-resistant Escherichia coli (FRE). The results demonstrated that a set of antisense P-PNAs, ASP-gyrA1 and ASP-parC1, targeting the translational initiation sites of DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV genes showed the strongest inhibitory effects on the growth of FRE isolates. In addition, ASP-gyrA3 and ASP-parC2, which bind to the FRE-specific coding sequence within the gyrA and parC genes, respectively, possessed the selective bactericidal effects against FRE isolates. These results imply potential of those antisense P-PNAs as antibiotic alternatives against FQ-resistance bacteria. The resistance to fluoroquinolones is a main subject for the use of antibiotic substances in veterinary medicine where the overuse and misuse of antibiotics is a major cause of resistance. Optimizing the dose and dose intervals are essential for achieving clinical cures and minimizing the emergence of fluoroquinolones resistance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters for the establishment of a reliable dose of enrofloxacin in chicken against Salmonella enteritidis. Male and female broiler chickens of 3-4 weeks old were assigned for this study. Enrofloxacin with a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight were administered through per oral (PO) and intra-venous (IV) routes. Blood samples were collected at different time intervals and serum concentrations of the drug were determined. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of enrofloxacin in different strains of S. enteritidis were determined. The pharmacokinetic data were then integrated with pharmacodynamics data to determine the surrogate markers of antibacterial activity. The elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) of enrofloxacinwere 12.84 \u00b1 1.4 and 25.84 \u00b1 1.4 hr after IV and PO administrations respectively. The peak concentration (C max ), the time when the C max reached (T max ) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were 6.74 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5g/kg, 0.22 \u00b1 0.1 hr, 21.13 \u00b1 0.9 \u00b5g \u00b7 hr/ mL for IV and 3.82 \u00b1 0.59 \u00b5g/kg, 0.65 \u00b1 0.12 hr, 20.84 \u00b1 5.0 \u00b5g \u00b7 hr/ mL, respectively. The bioavailability (F) of enrofloxacin after PO administration was 98.6 \u00b1 8.9%. The MIC 50 of this drug against different strains of S. enteritidis were found to 0.50 \u00b5g/mL. When this pharmacodynamic data was integrated with pharmacokinetic data, the 24 hr area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-24 )/ MIC 50 were 42.26 \u00b1 0.3 and 41.68 \u00b1 0.1, and the C max /MIC 50 were 13.48 \u00b1 0.7 and 7.64 \u00b1 0.2 respectively for IV and PO administrations. It is concluded that enrofloxacin dosage of 50 mg/kg of body weight by IV and PO administration with 24 hr dosing interval will provide effective treatment for the infection of chicken by S. enteritidis. This data indicate that dosage of enrofloxacin upswing 5 times than the conventional recommended dosage. Introduction: Respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality in livestock, leads to economic losses. Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility of veterinary pathogens is needed because abuse and misuse of antimicrobials cause the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, isolates from cattle and pigs were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities. Materials and Methods: From 2011 to 2016, 1,459 respiratory and gastrointestinal isolates were collected from cattle and pigs, nationwide. In cattle, Trueperella pyogenes (n = 7), Pasteurella multocida (n = 11), Mannheimia haemolytica (n = 9), Clostridium difficile (n = 35), C. perfringnes (n = 116), and Escherichia coli (n = 176) were collected. Isolates originated from pigs as follows; T. pyogenes (n = 50), P. multocida (n = 149), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (n = 61), Haemophilus parasuis (n = 15), Streptococcus suis (n = 177), Salmonella Typhimurium (n = 63), C. difficile (n = 170), C. perfringens (n = 214), and E. coli (n = 206). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disc diffusion method. Results: Overall antimicrobial resistance patterns were similar between cattle and pigs isolates. Most of the isolates showed relatively high resistance to majority of antimicrobials. E. coli and Salmonella exhibited low resistance to ceftiofur (3.5-12.6% ) and colistin (0-3.6%). Clostridium sp. was susceptible to amoxicillin (0-5.1%), florfenicol (4.1-9.4%) and doxycycline (1.2-10.8% ). Respiratory pathogens have relatively low resistance to ceftiofur (0-6.7%), cephalexin (1.3-13%) , amoxicillin (0-5.4%) and doxycyclin (0-18%).",

These result may be provide the recent knowledge to establish strategies for treatment against respiratory and gastrointestinal disease in cattle and pigs. Abstract: The use of lactic acid bacteria as probiotics in food is on the increase in view of their ability to positively influence health and healthy living. In this report, we mined some of the bioinformatics of the strain, Streptococcus thermophilus KLDS 3.1003. 16s RNA sequencing was also carried out to determine its closest neighbor strains. S. thermophilus KLDS 3.1003 has a 1,899,956-bp genome with an exopolysaccharide production is 358 mg/L. Its closest neighbours include S. thermophilus LMD-9, LMG18311 and CNRZ1066. In depth amino acid coding gene analysis shows that S. thermophilus KLDS 3.1003 can synthesize all twenty (20) essential amino acids required for proper body functioning as well as animal feed formulations. These details are important in not only understanding the molecular basis behind its potential probiotic properties but also give new insights as to its potential future applications in the dairy and allied industries. Background: The components of our diet have been shown to have strong correlation with the spread of a number of diseases. In recent years and especially with the rapid development of 'omic' molecular tools, a large number of beneficial bacterial strains have been sequenced, thus increasing our understanding of the basis for their current and potential health benefits. As the second most important lactic acid bacteria in the world, several strains of Streptococcus thermophilus have been shown to have a number of in vitro and in vivo probiotic properties. We have recently shown that S. thermophilus KLDS 3.1003 possesses a total of 23 EPS-coding genes but also has high antimicrobial activity against pathogenic S. aureus, E. coli and G. vaginalis. Here, we report more data on the bioinformatics of this strain which may be linked to its potential probiotic properties. Methodology: S. thermophilus KLDS 3.1003 strain was obtained from traditional yoghurt starter culture in Inner Mongolia, China. The whole genome sequencing of Streptococcus thermophilus KLDS 3.1003 was performed using Pacbio RSII (20 K library) and Illumina Hiseq 4000 (500bp PCR-free library) strategies respectively. Then, 402 M Hiseq and 556 M Pacbio clean data were generated using a refined data filter. PacBio reads were assembled using the protocol in SMRT Analysis v2.3.0 Pipe: RS_HGAP_Assembly3. In addition, a phylogenetic tree was constructed to show the evolutionary status of S. thermophilus KLDS 3.1003 based on 16s rRNA analysis. EPS quantification of this strain was determined as earlier. Results and Discussion: In this report, we show that S. thermophilus KLDS 3.1003 displayed a similarity of \u226599% to Streptococcus stains deposited in NCBI based on 16s rRNA analysis. A distinctive branch of KLDS 3.1003 with Streptococcus thermophilus strains in the phylogenetic tree (see Figure 1 ) and S. thermophilus ATCC 19258 was found to be the closest evolutionary relative of KLDS 3.1003, thus resulting in the strain being recognized as S. thermophilus ssp. Other close neighbours include via MG-RAST analysis include S. thermophilus LMG18311 and S. thermophilus CNRZ1066. These strains have been studied extensively in a previous investigation. The genome of S. thermophilus KLDS 3.1003 consists of a 1,899,956bp chromosome with a G + C content of 38.90% (see Figure 2 ). Here, we have also analyzed its tRNA status and our result shows that S. thermophilus can synthesize all twenty (20) essential amino acids needed for proper body functioning in both adults and children. The EPS production of this stains was shown to be approximately 358 mg/L. EPS has been shown to have probiotic properties in recent reports. Further studies into the characterization of its EPS as well as its optimization are required to further explore the probiotic potentials of this strain. The amino acid profile of this strain confirms that it has the capacity to secrete all twenty (20) essential amino acids which are necessary for proper body functions in both children and adults. More amino acid-coding genes were found to be associated with the production of leucine, lysine, methionine, alanine and valine. The presence of lysine and methionine are key in animal feed formulation. This strain thus has potentials in the food industry as a functional food ingredient and starter culture. Further studies on the conditions for the optimization of its amino acid production are recommended. The presence of the Cl. difficile toxin gene (tcdA, tcdB and binary toxin) was also detected by PCR.",

Background: The plasmid-borne mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was initially identified in China, and was subsequently reported worldwide. Recently, mcr-1-harboring plasmids were identified in 11 Escherichia coli isolates from livestock in Korea. We investigated the characteristics of colistin-resistant E. coli with mcr-1-harboring plasmid Methods: Determination of growth rate and competition assay were performed to compare the bacterial fitness between mcr-1 plasmid harboring colistin-resistant E. coli (EC006, EC019, and EC111) and non-plasmid mediated colistin-resistant E. coli (E015R, E139R, and E154R) strains. Biofilm-forming capacity was assessed by microtiter plate method. For non-plasmid mediated colistinresistant strains, mutations and expression levels of the basRS, phoPQ, and eptA genes were determined. Lipid A structure was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-offlight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Results: Competition with E. coli MG1655 strain revealed no difference in competitive fitness between plasmid mediated and non-plasmid mediated colistin-resistant E. coli strains. Biofilm assay also showed similar levels of biofilm formation in all colistinsusceptible and -resistant strains tested. Three non-plasmid mediated colistin-resistant strains had amino acid alterations in BasS and their expression levels of eptA were significantly increased compared to those of colistin-susceptible strains. Lipid A structure in all mcr-1 plasmid harboring colistin-resistant strains was modified through the addition of phosphoethanolamine as in a non-plasmid mediated colistin-resistant strain E015R. Conclusion: Our data indicate that plasmid-borne mcr-1 does not impair fitness in E. coli. Lipid A modification by Mcr-1 was also the main colistin resistance mechanism, along with EptA and the spread of this transferable colistin-resistant determinant may accelerate the increase of colistin resistance. Background: Persister cell, which stays in dormant form when antibiotics exist, makes it difficult to remove pathogens completely from patients, which results in treatment failure. We characterized persister formation in Acinetobacter baumannii, one of the major nosocomial pathogens. Materials and Methods: In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with 20 clinical isolates of A. baumannii.",

To characterize properties of persister formation fromA. baumannii, persister assay was performed with various ways. Serial persister assay was also performed; two random persister colonies which were survived from first persister assay, were re-inoculated into fresh LB broth each and incubated overnight. Second persister assay was performed for the overnight cultures, with the same protocol. Results: For four antibiotics, there was no correlation between persister rates and specific strains. That is, an isolate exhibiting a high persister cell formation rate for one antibiotic did not necessarily show a high rate of persister production for other antibiotics. The persister formation rate for the same antibiotic was almost constant when the persister assay was repeated three times. Serial persister assay for re-grown persister cell in antibiotic-free media showed that the persister formation rate was the same as the initial one. Conclusions: Our data suggest that persister cells are formed by different mechanisms for each antibiotic. The persister rate against antibiotics is an intrinsic property of each strain. Carbapenem has been used for treatment against bacterial infections as the most reliable last-line drugs. However, with the abuse of carbapenem, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) as well as Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has emerged in worldwide. In Korea, all laboratories should submit suspected CRE isolates to KCDC for confirmation of CRE and carbapenemase-production. In this study, we confirmed and analyzed characteristics of CRE isolates like species identification, carbapenem resistance patterns and carbapenemase gene type. Antimicrobial susceptibility was examined by broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods using CLSI guideline. The carbapenemase genes (IMP, OXA-48, VIM, NDM, KPC and GES) were investigated by PCR and analyzed by sequence alignment method. A total of 1,810 CRE suspected isolates were collected (between January and June 2017) and 1,793 (99%) isolates were Enterobacteriaceae and 17 (1%) were non-Enterobacteriaceae. The ratios of CRE, CIE and CSE were 87%, 7% and 6%, respectively. Among CRE isolates (1,562 isolates), Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter spp. were the most prevalent types of CRE isolates, with the occurrence in 65%, 14% and 14%. In addition, 986 isolates showed CPE positive (63%) and harbored bla KPC\u22122 and bla NDM\u22121 gene 703 (73.1%) and 142 (14.4%), respectively. Most of CPE had one carbapenemase gene but 38 (3.85%) isolates harbored 2 genes at the same time and predominant type was bla NDM\u22121 and bla OXA\u2212181 type (21 isolates, 55%). In conclusion, June 3, 2017 mandatory submission system of suspected CRE was started in Korea, so continuous monitoring of CRE occurrence and characteristics change will be investigated and reported. Background: Fluoroquinolone is one of the most commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, the rates of fluoroquinolone resistance are increasing according to the frequent use.

So, synergistic antimicrobial agents with simliar pharmacokinetics for combinations must be favorable to prevent resistance, and their maximum FICIs were perfectly less than 0.50. periods, with the remarkable increase of ST166, which mainly due to increase of serotype 11A in Korea. In addition, ST558 which consisted of serotype 35B was also found frequently in 2012-2016, which was not found in [2008] [2009] . Conclusion: This study showed the persistently high prevalence of macrolide resistance and increasing number of pneumococci carrying both erm(B) and mef(A) in Korea. Given the current epidemiology of macrolide resistance, an empirical use of macrolides alone may not be an appropriate choice for the treatment of pneumococcal infection in adult patients in Korea. Therefore, continued surveillance of pneumococcal epidemiology of macrolide resistance would be necessary. According to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (CLSI) guideline, agar and broth dilution method were used to detect vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus. However, recent advances in automated devices have led to increased use of automated instrument in hospitals. In this study we compared the results of vancomycin susceptibility test between agar, broth dilution method and vitek2 instrument using vancomycin MIC 3\u223c4 ug/ml Staphylococcus aureus strains by E-test method. A total of 27 strains were used in this experiment which were collected in 2016 year through vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus surveillance system in Korea. The accordance between agar dilution and broth dilution was 85% (4 strains were different from 27 strains). But resistant susceptibility was not affected. And the accordance between agar, broth dilution method and vitek2 instrument was 74%, respectively. The results of vitek2 instrument showed 2 times higher MIC (4 strains) and 4 times higher MIC results (1 strain) than CLSI method. These results changed vancomycin susceptible (MIC 2) to intermediate (MIC 4, MIC 8) susceptibility. Until now, the detail accordance analysis was not accomplished against vitek2 vancomycin susceptibility using large number strains of various vancomycin MIC susceptibility. But this study showed vitek2 results need additional broth dilution experiment for vancomycin resistant susceptibility confirmation.",

Farms with higher numbers of cattle, and those with one more positive animal, were 2.6 and 1.9 times more at risk for establishment of BTB, respectively, compared with the farm only one BTB outbreak. Conclusion: To our understanding this is the first report that has encompassed dairy and beef farms in South Korea. Furthermore, results of risk factor analysis will be useful as entry points for future informed decision making towards BTB control and eradication program in the country. Conclusion: Our data showed the LTBI prevalence among HCWs working in our hospital were 40%, and was increasing tendency by age. Physicians were less likely to accept treatment than other HCWs, and this finding suggests effort to enhance LTBI treatment acceptance among physicians will be needed. Background: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) remains an important disease in many countries of the world, causing significant economic losses and proving difficult to control. The detection method of residual Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) in the environment is needed to control bTB on herd level. Nested PCR amplification was applied in this study to ensure the specificity of detection, eliminate any false-positive results, and increase the amplification signal, providing the method with the highest sensitivity of environmental sample. In this study, we attempted to establish a method for detection of M. bovis in environmental sample using nested-PCR method and to detect residual M. bovis in the cattle herds where was carried disinfection. Materials and Methods: 60 Environmental samples (51 fecal samples, 9 bottles water) from (10 herds) herds where have a history of bTB outbreak were used for the detection of residual Mycobacterium bovis. Amplicon libraries of IS 6110 target gene fragment was amplified from M. bovis DNA by using the two types of primer sets. For the first step, PCR amplification of the 716 bp length for IS 6110 gene was performed and each sample was purified to remove the others. The purified library amplicons were re-amplified by second PCR primer set (203 bp) to increase detection sensitivity. After each PCR amplification round, the size of the PCR product was verified on a 1.5% agarose gel.",

In the standard PCR method, the sensitivity of detection of M. bovis was very low due to contaminants and other microorganisms in environmental samples. However, the sensitivity of this nested-PCR for M. bovis was high compared to previous one, which is useful as a detection method in environmental samples. Due to resistance to outside environment, bTB is often reported as recurrent outbreak in same herd. Therefore, it is important to carry out more thorough hygiene management with test and slaughter of reactors. This nested-PCR will be used as a useful tool for screening Mycobacterium bovis in environmental samples as one of the methods to control bTB on herd level. (26 cases) were the most common sites of TB presentation. CNS involvement was the third most common presentation (25 cases), followed by TB lymphadenopathy (21 cases), pleurisy (21 cases), pericardial involvement (11 cases), skin involvement (2 patients), and others (5 cases). Of the 163 patients, 114 (69.9%) had positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay result, and 2 (1.2%) had indeterminate result. The percentage of positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay results was highest in the proven TB group (41/47, 87.2%), followed as 69.1% (38/55) in probable TB group, and then 57.4% (35/61) in possible TB group (p = 0.007). In the 47 proven cases, 5 cases (10.6%) had negative QuantiFERON-TB incubation at 37\u00b0C for an hour, anti-mouse-antibody (1:5000, SIGMA A 6154) was added. Lastly, TMB (BD Biosciences) was added to each well (100 \u03bcl/well). Then, 50 \u03bcl of the Stop solution (2N H2SO4) was added to each well. Finally, the optical density was measured at 450 nm. ELISA: The purpose of this ELISA was to observe the binding of mRID fused RBD to the MERS-COV infected rabbit and human serum. MERS-infected cell lysate (MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/ 002_05_2015), mRID fused RBD and HR2 were loaded onto 96well nunc immunoplate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for O/N coating at 4\u00b0C.

After allowing two hours of reaction time at RT, MERS-COV infected rabbit sera (starting from 10 ug to 0.25 ug) and the Patient serum (1:100 diluted) were placed into the wells (100 ul/well). After two hours of incubation at RT, diluted 2nd antibody (1:3,000, Goat Anti-human IgG Antibody, KPL) was added, measuring 100 ul per well. After another hour of incubation at RT, TMB (BD Biosciences) was added at 50 \u03bcl/well were added.

However, recent research showed that RNA can function as chaperones to aid in protein folding and stability. Thus, we carried out cell lysis to verify the role of RNA in RID-fused proteins in the folding and stability maintenance. RNA was removed in-vitro, while another was incubated as the control at 37\u00b0C. Agarose gel verified that RNA was removed only when treated with RNase A (Fig. 3A ). In addition, the SDS-PAGE analysis using Western blot and Coomassie staining confirmed that both mRID fused protein showed a decrease in their solubility when RNA was removed (Fig. 3B) . RID fused RBD protein bound to hDPP4 receptor: We verified the binding between the RBD protein produced in the E. coli system and the hDPP4 receptor using the co-immunoprecipitation and ELISA. First, the binding between RBD protein and hDPP4 was verified using co-immunoprecipitation by protein A magnetic beads with dpp4-specific antibody. Then, we performed Western blotting (Fig. 4A) . Also, we used hdpp4 protein as the coating antigen to observe that binding of the RBD protein is concentration-dependent. Then, antihis antibody was used in the ELISA assay for further verification (Fig. 4B) . Such findings concluded that successful folding of E. coli derived RBD protein result in binding to the DPP4 receptor. Sero-diagnosis based on the RBD and HR2 antigen from MERS-COV infected serum: We predicted that the mRID fused RBD and HR2 protein are suitable for sero-diagnosis. Thus, RBD was used as the coating antigen, the rabbit sera immunized with inactivated MERS-COV was serially diluted first for the ELISA assay. We identified binding of the RBD and MERS-COV immunized rabbit sera (Fig. 5A ). Furthermore, ELISA was performed using the sera (1:100 diluted) of the four patients infected with MERS-COV. For the RBD coating antigen, the binding sensitivity for the three MERS-COV infected patient sera is higher than the MERS-COV infected cell lysate (Fig. 5B ). However, for the 1:100 diluted normal person sera, almost none was detected by the RID-fused RBD and HR2. These results demonstrate that mRID-fused RBD and HR2 can serve as a powerful antigen for rapid and accurate diagnosis and mass production.",

However, the drawbacks of such preexisting method include high cost and low production output. Therefore, it is certainly necessary to mass-produce the appropriate diagnostic antigens at a low cost and time efficient manner. In conclusion, for the first time, we employed Chaperna (RNAmediated chaperone) to produce potential sero-diagnostic antigens such as RBD and HR2 from E. coli to diagnose patients and animals infected with MERS-CoV. Using ELISA, it was verified that the antigens bind to the patient's serum with a higher affinity than to the MERS-CoV infected cell lysate. Also, we were able to establish a high accurate diagnostic technique using an additional HR2 antigen to double-check the verified diagnosis. This platform will become extensively applicable not only to MERS-CoV, but also to the outbreak of various pandemic viruses to allow quick diagnosis. We continue our endeavor for improving and applying the RNAdependent folding system for diagnostic and prophylactic applications. Ongoing research is dedicated to harnessing Chaperna for the assembly of vaccine antigens into nanoparticles for gaining high neutralizing capacities.",

But, lots of patients were having abnormal ECG and more frequently involvement in fatal cases. Additional studies are needed about cardiac involvement of SFTSV. Since the outbreaks of Hendra virus and Nipah virus in Asia, several Henipaviruses detection assays based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) have been developed. In this study, analytical validation of these assays was performed to evaluate their sensitivity and reliability for the preparedness of Henipavirus outbreak. The assays targeting Hendra virus matrix gene (M) and Nipah virus nucleoprotein (N) gene were evaluated for sensitivity by calculation of limits of detection (LODs), estimated among over 13 replicates with 0.01-100 copies/reaction. The assays targeting both Hendra virus and Nipah virus phosphaprotein gene (P) were also evaluated. The performances of these assay systems were comparable to each other when tested against in vitro transcribed RNA samples. Our results demonstrate that these assays are reliable tools for the rapid diagnosis, clinical surveillance, and epidemiological study of suspected Henipavirus cases. Formerly these samples were tested for influenza viruses by RT-PCR. Full length of hemagglutinin gene of the isolates was sequenced using Sanger method. Also 118 samples including previous 29 isolates, full genome segments were obtained on a MiSeq platform (Illumina). Phylogenetic tree was generated using MEGA v.6 and correlation plots were constructed between each amino acid substitution. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the isolated Ainfluenza viruses belonged to the subclades of 3C.2a. A correlation plot using 34 amino acid substitutions in HA from our isolates revealed that the R142K and R142G substitutions were positively and negatively correlated with the D160N substitution, respectively, suggesting that the R142K and R142G were obvious characteristics of viruses in the new subgroup. Also full genome segments from MiSeq platform were revealed various correlation result. Isolated Viruses period in 2016-2017 season, more than 30% of sample had 142 substitution mutation, which is one of the key characteristics of 3C.3a clade represented by the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 virus, the vaccine strain in the previous season.",

RFP-resistant mutants were selected in vitro by serial passaging with progressively increasing 2-fold concentrations of RFP. Both IDRL-8883-s (susceptible to RFP) and 8883-r (resistant to RFP) were recovered from a patient with a prosthetic joint infection. RP62A 3Bs, 3Br, 1Ws, and 1Wr were recovered from bone (3Bs and 3Br) or a foreign body (1Ws and 1Wr) of animals identically infected with RP62A and treated with RFP monotherapy. A total of 16 colonies with a RP62A background and a total of 63 colonies with anIDRL-8883 background were analyzed for rpoB mutations. The relative fitness of the RFP susceptible and the isogenic RFP resistant strains were determined using a paired competition assay. Results: A resistant strain was rapidly selected in a single-step fashion with RP62A. In contrast, resistance to RFP was observed in incremental steps with IDRL-8883. All mutations were detected in cluster I of rpoB. The five following amino acid substitutions were detected in vitro: Asp-471\u2192Asn, Asp-471\u2192Gly, Asp-471\u2192Val, Ser-486\u2192Tyr, and His-481\u2192Tyr. The three following amino acid substitutions were detected in vivo: His-481\u2192Tyr, Ser-486\u2192Phe, and Gln-468\u2192Lys. in vitro competition assays revealed that all RFPresistant mutants other than Ser-486\u2192Phe and Ser-486\u2192Tyr had a relative fitness of less than 1.0. Prolonged exposure to RFP selected for RFP-resistant strains (Ser-486\u2192Phe and Ser-486\u2192Tyr)with no fitness defect. Conclusions: Several point mutations concentrated in cluster I of rpoB emerged over the course of exposure to RIF; some, but not all of these mutations were associated with fitness defects.

In comparison, the most frequently recovered Candida species from blood and other sterile fluids (241 isolates) was C. albicans (102, 42.3%), C. tropicalis (54, 22.4%), followed by C. glabrata (48, 19.9%), and C. parapsilosis (27, 11fluconazole (one C. albicans, one C. glabrata, one C. tropicalis, three C. parapsilosis, and six C. krusei isolates), 0.7% for voriconazole (one C. tropicalis and one C. krusei isolates), 0% for micafungin, and 0.3% for caspofungin (one C. glabrata isolate), respectively. All isolates were WT to amphotericin B. Among 12 isolates of non-common species, four (two C. auris, one C. guilliermondii, and one Candida pelliculosa isolates) showed a fluconazole MIC of \u226564 \u00b5g/ml. All these isolates with azole or caspofungin resistance were recovered from sterile sites except two C. auris isolates. No significant differences in MIC 50 and MIC 90 were detected between the blood Candida isolates and those collected at other sites for each of the five antifungal agents. Conclusions: The current study shows that overall resistance rate of Candida species is still low in Korea. Continuous national surveillance programs should be needed to identify changes in the antifungal susceptibility patterns of Candida isolates with caution to increasing C. glabrata having the potential for resistance to antifungal agents.

Sahm 1 .International Health Management Associates, Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA, 2 Pfizer Inc., Collegeville, PA, USA Background: The increase of MDR Enterobacteriaceae is a major concern globally. These pathogens are responsible for a variety of serious infections and with resistance to several antimicrobial classes are difficult to treat. Data from the Tigecycline Evaluation Surveillance Trial (TEST) program were analyzed to evaluate the status and antimicrobial susceptibility of MDR Enterobacteriaceae from AFME and AP Regions. Methods: From 2012 to 2016, 4,632 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from countries in AFME and AP regions were collected, identified, and susceptibility tested using broth microdilution and CLSI guidelines. MDR was defined as resistance to drugs from three or more different antimicrobial classes.Conclusions: The MDR rate among Enterobacteriaceae was higher in AP in comparison to AFME. Amikacin, meropenem and tigecycline were the most active drugs in vitro against the MDR population in both regions. The prevalence and importance of MDR Enterobacteriaceae warrants ongoing surveillance. The ESBL rate was 38.0% in AFME, and 22.8% in the AP regions.

It is a filamentous Basidiomycete, a group of environmental fungi which are frequently considered contaminants in culture and not pathogenic. However, it can present with invasive disease in immunosuppressed hosts. We describe three cases of disseminated Volvariella volvacea infection in patients with haematological malignancies. All patients were neutropenic at onset of infection and developed pulmonary and brain lesions. In the first patient, Volvariella volvacea was identified via direct PCR and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) from the brain biopsy. Brain biopsies were non-diagnostic for the other two patients. These two patients also developed skin lesions which had histological evidence of fungal infection with angioinvasion resembling Zygomycosis. Tissue cultures grew Volvariella volvacea confirmed by sequencing. The isolates were non-clonal and thus unlikely to be a pseudo-outbreak. The first patient responded to dual therapy of liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole and was discharged on voriconazole monotherapy. The other two patients did not improve despite dual therapy and succumbed to their infection. While environmental Basidiomycetes are usually benign, clinicians should be aware of Volvariella volvacea as an emerging and potentially fatal cause of invasive fungal infection in patients with haematological malignancies.P1-MM02 Distribution of fungal isolates in new established clinical training centre, Malaysia F.

Microbiology Unit, Centre for Pathology Diagnostic & Research Laboratories, Faculty of Medicine, Sg. Buloh Campus, Universiti Teknologi MARA, MalaysiaAntifungal therapy is a critical component especially in managing opportunistic candida infection in immunocompromised group of patient. Emergence of antifungal resistance, particularly among Candida species, aggravates the problem. This study was aimed to describe the distribution of candida isolates obtained from blood and its antifungal susceptibility testing in the new clinical training centre, Malaysia from January 2014 to March 2017. Identification of all isolates was performed by assessment of its colonial morphology, germ tube test, microscopy examination and VITEK-2. Susceptibility testing was performed using sensititre broth microdilution method containing amphotericin B, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin. The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined based on the breakpoint by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. There were 14 isolates of Candida species isolated from blood with majority of isolates (n = 12; 85.7%) were identified as Candida albicans. The remaining were Candida tropicalis (n = 1; 7.14%) and Candida glabrata (n = 1; 7.14%) respectively. Susceptibility testing showed that all Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis were sensitive to tested azoles, amphotericin B and echinocandins. While Candida glabrata isolate was resistant to all tested azoles, anidulafungin and caspofungin, however it remains susceptible towards micafungin and amphotericin B. Candida albicans is the most commonly isolated Candida species from the blood, and remains susceptible to azoles, however emergence of azole and echinocandin resistant Candida glabrata isolate is evident in our centre that may results into limited choice of empiric antifungal therapy.P1-MM04 Evaluation of antifungal effects of nanoliposomal fluconazole against Fluconazole susceptible and resistant Candida species isolated from patients in vitro and comparison with common fluconazole M.

Jeong 1 . 1 Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, KoreaBackground: Candida bone & joint infection (CBJI) is a rare clinical disease. As most prior studies were limited to single cases and small case series, there were insufficient data on the epidemiology and outcome of CBJI. The aim of this study is to identify the predictive factors for successful treatment in CBJI. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on 33 patients with Candida confirmed on culture, among patients diagnosed with bone and joint infection between January 2006 and December 2016 at a tertiary care center in South Korea. Unfavorable outcome was defined as recurrence or mortality. years). There were 17 cases of arthritis and 16 cases of osteomyelitis. Candida albicans constituted 48.5%, C. parapsilosis 24.2%, C. tropicalis 6.1% and C. glabrata 6.1%. The neutrophil percentage in complete blood count at the time of diagnosis showed a difference between the favorable outcome group and the unfavorable outcome group (68.0% vs 79.6%, P = 0.016). There was a significant difference in neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (2.2 vs 4.8, P = 0.023), Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (40.5 vs 72.4 mm/hr, P = 0.024) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (15.3 vs 86.3 mg/L, P = 0.001) at the end of treatment. The duration of antifungal therapy showed a significant difference (124.9 days vs 44.3 days, P = 0.041). In the multivariate analysis, CRP at the end of treatment (P = 0.028) were found to be a predictive factor for successful treatment. Conclusion: CBJI is a rare disease but associated with high treatment failure. Prolonged antifungal treatment is essential for successful treatment of CBJI, and CRP at the end of treatment is a key predictive marker of successful treatment.P1-MM07Vitek characterisation of Type 2 diabetes-associated Candida species M.

Velashgerdi Farahani 1 *, F. Hashemi 2 , J. Hashemi 2 . 1 Hamedan University/Hamedan/Iran, 2 Tehran University of Medical Sciences/ Tehran/IranBackground: In recent years, the ubiquity of Candida infections by isolates resistant to common drugs and lack of proper diagnosis leads to failure in treatment. Considering the existence of the sensitivity pattern determinable for Candida isolates, to select the appropriate drug, it is essential to use the methods of determining the drug sensitivities of fungal agent. Therefore, we decided to study several anti-fungal drugs by using the disk diffusion and microdilotion method against Candida species to consider. Methods: In this study the 48 clinical isolates of Candida were identified using various different tests such as germ tube, culture on CHROM agar candida, cornmeal agar-Tween 80 and PCR. Their susceptibility test on amphotricin B miconazole econazole fluconazole and caspofungin was undertaken according to the standard Disk Diffusion CLSI-M 44 A and CLSI M27A3 for microdilution. Results: The survey found that 98% of candida studied were sensitive to amphotricin B, 85% were sensitive to miconazole, 85% to econazole, 69% were sensitive to fluconazole and 100% of isolated were susceptible to caspofungin. No resistance to amphotericin B and caspofungin was observed and a few isolated were resistant to miconazole, econazole, and fluconazole respectively and some isolated show dose dependent susceptibility. Conclusion: we observed that the candida studied had the highest rates of sensitivity to caspofungin and amphotericin B. Among Azoles the highest sensitivity respectively are to miconazole, econazole and then to fluconazole. Candida albicans has the highest sensitivity to caspofungin and amphotericin B and also has a high sensitivity to fluconazole, miconazole and econazole.Keywords: Candida, susceptibility, amphotericin B, caspofungin, azole P1-MM10 Survival analyses of Candida glabrata blood stream infection according to empirical antifungal agents and fluconazole MIC J.H.

Methods: Culture-positive proven/probable IPA (PP-IPA) were identified from the cohort of Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center. All consecutive Aspergillus species isolated from the significant respiratory specimen of hematologic patients with PP-IPA were collected from Jan 2016 to May 2017. We analyzed species distribution by using panfungal PCR for the internal transcribed spacer regions, and susceptibility testing according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute M38-A2 for Aspergillus isolates. Results: Of the 54 Aspergillus species, A. fumigatus (n = 29), A. niger (n = 11), A. flavus (n = 7), A. terreus (n = 4), A. nidulans (n = 1), A. oryzae (n = 1), and A. sydowii (n = 1) were identified. Of the 54 isolates, 14.8% had amphotericin B deoxycholate (AMB) minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of \u22652 \u00b5g/mL. MIC for itraconazole (ITR) (95.7%), voriconazole (VOR) (97.9%), and posaconazole (POS) (97.5%) were <2 \u00b5g/mL for most isolates. There were two cases of ITR resistant PP-IPA; one of which showed VOR cross-resistance in patients without azole exposure, and the other had POS crossresistance in patients with prolonged use of POS prophylaxis due to chronic graft-versus-host diseases. Conclusion: Non-fumigatus Aspergillus species accounted for about 46.3% of pathogenic clinical Aspergillus isolates from PP-IPA patients. Antifungal resistance was not common, but possible. Therefore, susceptibility results should be further collected in Korean Aspergillus isolates.

Most of the infection could be prevented through immunization by vaccines containing capsular polysaccharides but some infection may be caused by unencapsulated strains. Methods: Clinical isolates of pneumoniae from January 2013 to December 2015 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. Were serotyped by PCR Clinical and laboratory information were collected and analyzed. Results: During the study period, 39 non-typeable pneumococcal isolates were identified. Most (21 of 39, 53.9%) were collected from purulent upper respiratory tract secretion. Others were from corneal abscess, sputum, and one from blood of a sepsis newborn. We recorded a 3.6-fold increase in the rate of isolation from 1.4% in 2012 to 5.0% in 2015. Co-infection was found in 24 cases; the major co-infecting pathogens included non-typeable Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Most (39 of 40, 97.5%) of the isolates were susceptible to both penicillin and ceftriaxone. The dominant sequence type ST1106 and an emerging sequence type ST7502 were recognized among the isolates. Conclusions: Non-typeable pneumococci could cause respiratory and ophthalmological mucosal infection. Invasive infection could occur in newborns or young infants. Most of the unencapsulated isolates remain susceptible to penicillin or ceftriaxone. P1-VA02 Preparation of inactivated agent with different concentration of Ferric Chloride on Pasteurela and pathogenic bacteria Y. Tahamtan 1 , M. Homayoon 2 . 1 Microbiology Department, Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute, Shiraz Branch, Agriculture Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREEO), Shiraz, Iran, Microbiology Department, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran Background: Metals play a vital role in the metabolic processes of the microorganism and some of heavy metals are required by the organisms as micro nutrients. However, in high concentrations, heavy metal ions react to form toxic compounds in bacterial cells. Effect of different concentration of ferric chloride (FeCl3) on Pasteurella, Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria and Clostridium was investigated in the present study. Methods: All bacteria were inoculated in BHI broth supplemented with 10, 50 and 100 mM ferric chloride, and the incubation were done by Brown opacity tubes and spread plate method, respectively. The data obtained was used for deciding the inactivating concentration of FeCl3. Results: Total bacterial counts of all bacteria at 10, 50 and 100 mM FeCl3 did not increase significantly after 24 h inoculation. Viability of Salmonella and E. coli at 10 mM FeCl3 in BHI broth was less than 5 \u00d7 108 CFU/ml and was completely lost at 50 and 100 mM FeCl3 in BHI broth, when measured at 24 h. Viability of Pasteurella, Listeria and Clostridium at 10 mM FeCl3 was completely lost even when measured after incubation for 4 h. Discussion: This work suggests that use of iron as inactivated agent can improve novel inactivated vaccines for their use in developing countries. The inactivating effect of FeCl3 is achieved by its ability to precipitate proteins in the cell walls and to degrade/damage nucleic acids and lipids through free radical reactions.

Cancer is the main cause of death in developed countries. There are some scientific evidences indicating that parasitic infections induce antitumor activity against certain types of cancers. In this study, the effects of a fraction of hydatid cyst fluid on colon cancer tumor in BALB/c mice were investigated. Materials and methods: In this experimental work three groups of mice were challenged with mouse colon cancer cells. Two weeks later group one was injected with a fraction of hydatid cyst fluid absorbed on alum as adjuvant. The second group was injected with alum alone and the third group left intact. The tumor size in all mice were measured. Result: In mice injected with a fraction of hydatid cyst fluid tumor size was smaller than the two control groups and the difference was statistically significant. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that injection of a fraction of hydatid cyst fluid significantly inhibits the growth colon cancer growth.P1-VA07 Cost-effectiveness analysis of Zostavax in the prevention of Herpes Zoster in Korea J.

The live-attenuated HZ vaccine (ZOSTAVAX\u2122) was approved in 2009 and launched in 2013 for the prevention of HZ in Korea.Real world effectiveness studies have shown vaccine to reduce the incidence of HZ in US. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a HZ vaccination program versus no program from a Korea societal perspective. Methods: A decision analytic model was built to estimate the costs and health outcomes associated with a vaccination program (65 and older in the first three years, and only 65-year-old afterwards) for prevention of HZ in a static 1,000-person cohort. Coverage rates were assumed to be 70% in year 1 and 80% in the following years. Costs included were vaccine acquisition, vaccine administration, adverse event related, HZ-related, and worker productivity. Costs were expressed in 2017 South Korean Won (KRW). Utility values were applied based on health status. Inputs were derived from published literature, public datasets, and clinical trial data. All outcomes were calculated over a 35-year time horizon and discounted at 5% per annum. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were then calculated as cost per QALY gained. Oneway and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to characterize parameter uncertainty.Results:The vaccination program is estimated to result in 1,456 more QALYs than no program. The vaccination program reduced costs by 1,163,604,768 KRW due to vaccination costs being offset by reduction in treatment costs. Conclusions: In Korea, compared with no program, the (ZOSTAVAX\u2122) vaccine program was estimated to be the dominant strategy (improve health outcomes and cost saving).P1-VA08Efficacy of inactivated Hantaan virus vaccine (Hantavax\u2122) in healthy adults through the eyes of metabolomics A.

Lee. Department of Pediatrics, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul, KoreaBecause asplenic children have an increased risk of fulminant bacteremia associated with a high fatality, chemoprophylaxis and vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria are recommended for prevention of severe infection. However, there have been rare reports on the burden of severe bacterial infection and current status of chemoprophylaxis and immunization rates among asplenic children in Korea. We conducted a retrospective study including children with asplenia who were treated at our institute from January 1997 to December 2016. Out of a total of 229 asplenic children, 118 were congenital asplenia, and 63 were functional asplenia including polysplenia. The remaining 48 were acquired asplenia; mean age at splenectomy was 12.1 (\u00b1 standard deviation, 4.0) years old, and the most common cause of splenectomy was hereditary spherocytosis (33.3%). The overall chemoprophylaxis rate was 31.4%. The immunization rate for encapsulated bacteria were 52.4% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 56.3% for Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), and 28.4% for meningococcus, respectively; age-appropriate coverage rate for all 3 vaccines was 21.4%. During the study period, total 7 episodes of invasive bacterial infection were observed(3.1%; 0.33/100 person-year)  at the median age of 16 months(range, 4-68 months). Six of the seven episodes were bacteremia, and the other was meningitis. The most common pathogen was S. pneumoniae (n = 3), and followed by Hib (n = 1). Three of the seven patients died (42.8%), all of whom had pneumococcal bacteremia. Six out of seven cases occurred in the congenital asplenia, the remaining one occurred in the functional asplenia. None of the seven had chemoprophylaxis and proper vaccinations. Physicians should encourage to implement appropriate chemoprophylaxis and necessary immunizations as well as regular follow-ups for asplenic patients.P2-LB11 Serological study on lyme disease in national park workers in South Korea K.M.

Suspected cases of LD have been increasing; however, its serological and epidemiological features have not been widely examined in South Korea. Thus, we investigated the seroprevalence of LD among national park workers in South Korea considered to be at high risk of exposure to Borrelia species. Methods: A total of 763 sera from forestry employees working in national parks ineight provinces across the country were collected in December 2016. Those sera were examined to detect IgGorIgM antibodies to Borrelia species by 2-tier serologic tests according to a laboratory diagnostic guideline for LD. Indirect immunofluorescence antibody assays (IFA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed for screening tests, defining seropositive results as an IgG titer of \u22651:256 or IgM titer of \u22651:16 in IFA,or optical density ratio measured at 450 nm of reacting IgG or IgM with \u22651.1 in ELISA. Only seropositive samples were confirmed as seroprevalent by scoring \u22657 points in western blot (WB) assays. Additionally, demographic data was obtained by questionnaire survey. Results & Conclusions: Sixty workers (7.9%) were seropositive according to IFA and 3 (0.4%) of these cases were seroprevalent according to WB. ELISA results were seropositive in 245 (32.1%) workers. It is considered that the sensitivity of our primary test (IFA) should be improved. Although these results may be limited to certain groups, this study is important for determining the seroprevalence of population at high risk of contracting LD. Periodic monitoring of various tick-borne diseases as well as LD in high-risk groups across the country should be performed for prevention and control.

Kang*, H.M. Kim, C.-K. Kim, M.-S. Kim, A. Lee, N. Lee, J.-H. Park, Y.-S. Chung, C. Kang. Division of Viral Diseases, Center for Laboratory Control of Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, South Korea The Korea Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Surveillance System (KINRESS) has been implemented to analyze pattern of influenza and respiratory viruses since May, 2009. The total of 102,141 (average 250 samples /week) respiratory specimens were collected during 2009-2017. The weekly viral detection rate was analyzed by real-time PCR for 8 respiratory viruses [Human adenovirus (HAdV), Human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), Influenza virus (IFV), Human Corona virus (HCoV), Human rhinovirus (HRV), Human bocavirus (HBoV), and Human metapneumovirus (HMPV)].In general, IFV type A was detected first of all in every beginning of winter season and followed by IFV type B in spring. While the incidence of HRV infection was increased in summer season, it was usually decreased in IFV prevalent season. As a result of the correlation analysis among eight respiratory viruses, correlation coefficient was \u22120.7013 ( p < 0.0001) for IFV and HRV compared with that of other viruses and a strong negative correlation was statistically significant between these two viruses. In addition, the detection rate has been increased in the order of IFV, HRV and HPIV since the 2012/2013 season. This study confirmed the incompatibility between IFV and HRV and their seasonality through KINRESS. This result will be useful as references for the management and prevention of respiratory viral infection. Therefore, surveillance system of respiratory viruses should be enforced to figure out viral respiratory epidemics through KINRESS. We appreciate all the participating private clinics and Public Health and Environment Research Institutes (PHERIs) participating in KINRESS. This study was supported by intramural grant(4851-304, 4834- 303)  from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. P2-LB13 Streptococcus pneumoniae Isolates from a multicenter surveillance in China 2011 to 2016: serotype distribution, antibiotic resistance and molecular epidemiology C. Zhao, Z. Li, H. Chen, F. Zhang, Q. Wang, X. Wang, Y. Zhang, H. Li, H. Wang. Department of Clinical Laboratory, Peking University People' Hospital, Beijing, 100044, ChinaObjectives: To be effective in controlling pneumococcal disease in China, it is important to figure out the epidemiology change of S. pneumoniae after PCV7 and PCV13 available in China. And the surveillance of pneumococcal drug resistance is also important. Methods: A total of 881 S. pneumoniae isolates were collected from China in 2011-2017. The agar dilution method was used to determine the antibiotic susceptibility according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Serotypes/groups were determined with the Quellung reaction using Pneumotest kits and type-specific antisera. 424 isolates were investigated with multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: The prevalence of S. pneumoniae resistance to penicillin was 51.9% (Oral breakpoint). The resistance rates to erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin were 95.2%, 96.9% and 92.5%. 2.2% and 0.8% of all isolates were resistant to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. 19F (25.65%), 19A (13.96%), and 15 (6.81%) were the most common serotypes. The coverage rates of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PCV7, PCV13, and PPV23) were 37.57%, 58.46% and 72.64%, respectively. Among the 424 isolates which were investigated with MLST, the three predominant STs were ST271 (28.30%), ST320 (17.22%) and ST81 (6.60%). Conclusions: S. pneumoniae isolates in China showed high resistance rates to \u03b2-lactams and macrolides. The prevalent serotypes were19F, 19A and 15. 19F and 19A  isolates showed high resistance against many antibiotic agents, while those isolates could be covered by PCV7 and PCV13. The coverage rate of PCV7 and PCV13 did not change significantly in the study period. The Taiwan19F-14 clone played a predominant role in the dissemination of pneumococcal isolates.P2-LB14 Seasonality of viral respiratory infection in the northern UAE J.H. Jeon 1,5 *, D.J.

Methods: Respiratory clinical specimens from the patients who visited the hospital between November 2014 and June 2017 were received for analysis. Respiratory virus test was performed using a multiplex real-time PCR kit (Anyplex RV16, Seegene, South Korea) to detect the following 16 viruses; adenovirus, influenza virus A and B, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A, RSV B, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human rhinovirus (HRV), Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human enterovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, and human bocavirus.Results: In all, 948 specimens were analyzed. Overall positivity rate was 37.7%. Influenza virus was the most frequently isolated virus (48.4% (169/329), 34.4% and 14% for influenza A and B respectively) and HRV took place the second (26.9% (94/329)). HMPV, human coronavirus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and human bocavirus showed a sporadic pattern of the positive rate. The positive rate of Influenza virus showed statistically significant seasonality of the positive rate (Peak/Low Ratio = 5.542, 95% confidence interval = 2.078-14.785) in the analysis by the geometrical method. The time of peak was observed on 18th of January. Conclusion: We observed a significant difference in seasonal positive rate in respiratory viral infection. Follow-up of the respiratory viral detection over several seasons will allow the better chance to understand the epidemiology of respiratory virus in the middle east area.P2-LB15 Characteristics and Impact of Antibiotic Selection on Outcomes in Patients with Culture-negative Pyogenic Spondylitis Y.D. Lee, Y.J. Kim, S.I. Kim. Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, KoreaBackground: Culture positivity is not so high in pyogenic spondylitis, although we attempt to find out the pathogen to cure the illness. The purpose of this study was to analyze clinical characteristics of culture-negative pyogenic spondylitis and determine whether empiric antibiotic selection could influence clinical outcomes without microbiological results. Methods: In patients diagnosed with pyogenic spondylitis in a tertiary teaching hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, data regarding characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were obtained retrospectively from the electronic database of hospital from 2012 until 2015. Blood and tissue cultures, antibiotic administration, and recrudescence were investigated. Results: During the study period, a total of 101 patients with pyogenic spondylitis were enrolled. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen, almost half. Sixty three of 101 patients (62.3%) were culture-negative. The median age of culture-negative patients was 68 (IQR 58-75) and 54.7% were male. Underlying diseases included previous spinal surgery (37.5%), degenerative spine disease (37.5%), diabetes mellitus (34%), etc. Sixty one percent of the patients received only medical treatment without surgery. Intravenous antibiotics were administered for a median of 29.5 days (IQR 17.7-38.5) of total antibiotic duration, median 60.5 days (IQR 47.7-85.5). The recrudescence was noted in 4 patients (6.3%) during follow-up. Antibiotic regimens including glycopeptides in patients with culture-negative pyogenic spondylitis did not have an impact on recrudescence rate compared with antibiotic therapy without glycopeptides(1/19 [5.3%] vs. 3/44 [6.8%], P > 0.999). Conclusion: Using glycopeptide antibiotics may not influence recrudescence in patients with pyogenic spondylitis not confirmed by microbiology. Further studies addressing antibiotic choice in these patients are needed.

The pathogen can be transmitted via inhalation, ingestion or direct inoculation. Recently, Q fever is rapidly increasing in Korea. The epidemiologic study and clinical study is needed. We reviewed 33 serologically confirmed Q fever cases diagnosed in Chungbuk National University Hospital from January 2007 to May 2017. Materials and Methods: We found 37 serologically confirmed Q fever patients via medical chart review. Four of them were found false positive in Q fever serology and excluded from analysis. We reviewed patients characteristics, clinical characteristics, fever duration, laboratory findings and the time interval between the symptom onset and serologic diagnosis of Q fever of the patients. Acute Q fever was diagnosed when phase II IgM >32 or IgG >128. Chronic Q fever was diagnosed when phase I IgG >800. Results: All of the confirmed Q fever patients were male. Two of them were diagnosed to chronic Q fever. The median age was 50.2 year. Average duration between the symptom onset and hospital visit was 9.66 days. Average fever duration (days between the fever onset and defeverscence) was 15.13 days. Many of the patients had positive auto-antibody result (11/33, 33%). Mean WBC count was 7018/\u03bcL, platelet count was 189,566/\u03bcL and CRP was 8.68 mg/dL. Mean AST/ALT of the patients on the first day in the hospital were 84.3/88.6 IU/mL. The bilirubin levels of the patients were normal except one patient. Focal consolidation of chest X-ray was found in three patients. Three of the 33 patients (9%) had animal contact history (cattle, goats and deer). Seventeen serology tests were performed within two weeks of patients' symptom onset. Six of them (6/17, 35.2%) could diagnose Q fever. Between the second and the fourth week after symptom onset, 10 of 19 tsts diagnosed Q fever. Between the fourth and the sixth week, sixth and the eighth week, and the eighth to twelfth week, 10 of 19 tests, 6 of 7 tests and 7 of 7 tests could diagnose Q fever respectively. After 8 weeks from the symptom onset, all 14 tests could diagnose Q fever. Patients who had false-positive results were diagnosed to Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, tsutsugamushi disease and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Conclusions: Q fever patients had non-specific clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. Male patients were diagnosed to Q fever more frequently. Most of the patients did not have animal contact history. Q fever serology can show false positive results in other acute infections or inflammatory conditions. Q fever serology is not sensitive to diagnose Q fever within 4 weeks after the symptom onset. However, after 4 weeks of symptom, most of the Q fever patients can be diagnosed on serologic base.P2-LB17 Clinical characteristics and risk factors for persistent or relapsing S. maltophilia bacteremia S.J. Kang 1 , T.h. Oh 1 , S.E. Kim 1 , U.J. Kim 1 , H.-C. Jang 1 , K.-H. Park 1 , S.I. Jung 1 *. 1 Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, South KoreaBackground: This study was performed to investigate the clinical characteristics and analysis the risk factors of persistent or relapsing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia bacteremia in adult patients. Methods: All patients \u226518 years old with S. maltophilia bacteremia from 2011 to May 2017 at 2 tertiary hospitals in Korea were investigated. Only the first episode of S. maltophilia bacteremia in a patient was included. Persistent bacteremia was defined as the consecutive blood culture positive for \u22655 days after initiation of appropriate antibiotics therapy. Relapse was defined as isolation of S. maltophilia from blood after completion of antibiotics treatment for the first episode of bacteremia. Results: Of total 100 patients with S. maltophilia bacteremia, ten of persistent, 8 of relapsing and 46 of non-persistent, non-relapsing cases were investigated. Thirty-six cases treated within appropriate antibiotics were excluded in this study. The presence of indwelling urinary catheter ( p = 0.011), nasogastric tube ( p = 0.003), mechanical ventilator treatment ( p = 0.001), previous colonization of S. maltophilia ( p = 0.016) were more frequently observed in patients with persistent bacteremia compared to non-persistent, nonrelapsing bacteremia cases. In patients with relapsing bacteremia, hematologic malignancy ( p = 0.022), neutropenia ( p = 0.001), and concomitant isolation of S. maltophilia in clinical samples other than blood ( p = 0.041) were more common than non-persistent, non-relapsing bacteremia patients. Catheter related infection (37.0%) followed by pneumonia (28.3%) was the most common primary focus of non-persistent, non-relapsing bacteremia whereas pneumonia was the most frequent cause of bacteremia in both of persistent and relapsing cases (40.0% and 50.0%). The overall 30-day mortality was 34.4% and not different between three groups ( p = 0.488). Acute kidney injury at the onset of bacteremia was independently related to 30-day mortality (OR, 5.67; 95% CI, 1.16-27.71; p = 0.032). Conclusion: In patients with indwelling catheters and underlying hematologic malignancy were more likely to have persistent or relapsing S. maltophilia bacteremia. Close monitoring and active treatment in patients with such risk factors should be encouraged.P2-LB18Development of a multiplexed opsonophagocytic killing assay (MOPA) for group B Streptococcus M.J.

Song 1 . 1 Korea University College of Medicine, Republic of Korea, 2 Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, Republic of Korea, 3 Womans University School of Medicine, Republic of Korea Background: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of sepsis in infants as well as chorioamnionitis in pregnant women.Methods: Opsonophagocytic killing assays (OPAs) are an essential technique in vaccine studies of encapsulated bacteria for estimating serotype-specific functional antibody levels in vitro. Here, we developed a three-fold multiplexed OPA (MOPA) to enable practical, large-scale assessment of GBS vaccine immunogenicity, including against serotypes Ia, III, and V. Results: First, three target bacteria strains resistant to streptomycin, spectinomycin, or kanamycin were generated by natural selection through exposure to increasing antibiotic concentrations. Since a high level of nonspecific killing (NSK) of serotype V was observed in a 12.5% baby rabbit complement (BRC) solution, the BRC concentration was optimized. The final GBS-MOPA BRC concentration was 9%, which resulted in less than 20% NSK. The specificity was measured by preabsorbing serum with inactivated GBS. The opsonic index (OI) of preabsorbed serum with the homologous serotype GBS was significantly reduced in all three serotypes tested. The accuracy of the MOPA was compared with that of a single OPA (SOPA) with 35 serum samples. The OIs of the MOPA correlated well with those of the SOPA, and the r 2 values were higher than 0.950 for all three serotypes. The precision of the MOPA assay was assessed in five independent experiments with five serum samples. The inter-assay precision of the GBS-MOPA was 12.5% of the average coefficient of variation. Conclusion: This is the first report to develop and standardize a GBS-MOPA, which will be useful for GBS vaccine development and evaluation.P2-LB19 Development of real time RT-PCR for five species of hantaviruses detected in South KoreaY.-J. Lee, S.-W. Park, A.R. Lim, H.S. Lee, S.J. Oh, J.-A. Lee, W.J. Lee, J. Ryou. Division of Emerging Infectious Disease & Vector Research, Center for Infectious Diseases Research, Korea National institute of Health, Republic of Korea Hantaviruses are enveloped viruses which have three segmented ribonucleic acids (RNAs) for their genetic substances. Five species of Hantaviruses, Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Imjin virus (IMJV), Muju virus (MUJV) and Soocheong virus (SOOV), were isolated or detected in South Korea. Two of them are causing a human disease called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The pathogenicities of the rest three viruses were not elucidated yet. We developed Real time RT-PCR of the five viruses for diagnosis and future survey. TaqMan-based primers and probes were designed to detect target sequences of the Sl segment of the viruses. Detection limits of the assays, which were calculated by the experiments with serially diluted transcribed RNAs, were 5, 1, 1, 10 and 1 copies/ul of HTNV, SEOV, IMJV, MUJV and SOOV. The specipicities of the assays were tested with the transcripts of other viruses. There was no cross reactivity among the viruses. In conclusion, we developed the Real time RT-PCR which can detect S segment of HTNV, SEOV, IMJV, MUJV and SOOV. These highly sensitive assays can be used for diagnosis, surveilance and the elucidation of the pathogenicity of viruses.P2-LB20Laboratory findings of Brucella melitensis in South Korea S.D.

Lee 2 . 1 Division of Bacterial Diseases, Center for Laboratory control of Infectious Diseases, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do 28159, Korea, Division of Bacterial Diseases Research, Center for Infectious Diseases Research, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do 28159, KoreaBackground: Brucellosis, caused by genus of the Gram-negative bacterium Brucella, continues to be a problem for humans and animals through the world. The highest prevalence of human brucellosis is currently found in areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Symptoms include fever, night sweats, anorexia, polyarthritis, meningitis, and pneumonia. Endocarditis, primarily associated with B. melitensis infection, is the principal cause of human mortality. Infection most commonly occurs through consumption of nonpasteurized dairy products from Brucella-infected animals but can also occur by direct contact with infected animals or tissues or fluids associated with abortion. B. melitensis is the most serious brucellosis all over the world except Korea. But recently we found a few cases of B. melitensis in Korea. There were 1 case in 2013, 2 cases in 2015 and 3 cases in 2016. In this study we introduce these 3 imported cases in 2016 which were inferred to Korea CDC. Materials & Methods: Suspected 18 blood samples of brucellosis were sent to Korea CDC(KNIH) and inoculated into media of BACTEC system to cultivate the bacteria like Brucella. After checking the positive signal in BACTEC system, the product of cultivation was streaked on blood agar and Brucella agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 atmosphere in BL3 lab . After several passages through Brucella agar plate, the pure isolates were examined by oxidase test, urea hydrolysis, H 2 S production test and PCR test using Brucella specific primers (16s rRNA, BCSP31, Omp2) including Brucella species specific multiplex PCR. In addition, draft full genome sequence analysis of these isolates were performed and analysed. Results & Conclusions: As a result, 3 of 18 cases were identified as B. melitensis. They were grown in Brucella agar plate and showed negative result for H 2 S production and positive for oxidase and urease. DNA from isolates were extracted and amplified in Brucella specific genes and were positive in B. melitensis species specific multiplex PCR. Draft full genome sequence analysis also showed those were belonged to B. melitensis. These 3 cases identified as B. melitensis had common clinical history that they had been abroad and got unpasteurized milk or camel milk or contact with sheep. Although there was nonaturally born B. melitensis case in Korea, we need to diagnose any kind of Brucella spp. including B. melitensis and B. suis. The visitors to endemic or epidemic areas with B. melitensis need to pay attention not to get contact with cattle, goat and sheep nor eat unpasteurized milk and dairy product. In Korea there has no report of B. melitensis in animals.

Park 1 *, J. Oh 1 , J.S. Lee 1 . 1 Department of Internal Medicine, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, South Korea Backgroud: Candidemia is associated with high mortality. Although prompt initiation of antifungal therapy is essential an improvement of prognosis, early diagnosis of candidemia remains a challenge. Recent models of automatic cell analyzers provide the delta neutrophil index (DNI), which corresponds to the fraction of immature granulocytes in circulating blood. This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of DNI as a predictive and prognostic factor in patients with candidemia. Methods: We retrospectively collected data on adult patients with candidemia admitted to Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital between July 2015 and June 2017. Control patients were chosen by matching the date the blood culture was conducted (\u00b15 days) and the blood culture result was negative. DNI data on the day of the first blood culture were compared among the groups, and 14-day mortality associated with candidemia was assessed. Results: A total of 65 patients with candidemia were identified and matched to 65 control patients. Candidemia group had significantly higher DNI values than control group (3.40% vs 1.25%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, DNI was a significant independent factor for predicting candidemia (odd ratio 1.295; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.058-1.584, P = 0.012). The area under the receiver operating curve for DNI value to predict candidemia was 0.775 (95% CI; 0.691-0.860, P < 0.001). The best cutoff value for DNI for predicting candidemia was 2.75%. DNI was significantly higher in those who died than in the survivors in candidemia group (14.7% vs 3.30%, P < 0.001) and was identified to be an independent predictor for 14-day mortality in patients with candidemia. Conclusion: DNI is a potentially useful diagnostic and predict mortality among patients with candidemia. Thus, these finding suggest that DNI may be a useful marker in the management of patients with candidemia.P2-LB22 Treatment outcome of pneumonia due to carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii complex W.S.

The most common form of infection caused by CRAB is pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The CRAB infection causes high severity and mortality, but the available antibiotic regimen against CRAB is limited. In addition, data on evaluation and comparison of clinical outcomes according to the various combinations of antibiotics are also very limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcome of antibiotics regimens against CRAB pneumonia in adult patients in ICUs. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study and 10 medical institutions in Korea participated. The study subjects were adult patients over 18 years of age who were hospitalized in the ICUs from January 2011 to October 2015, diagnosed with pneumonia due to CRAB, and administered selective antibiotics against CRAB for more than 48 hours. CRAB was defined as A. baumannii complex with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >8 mg/L for imipenem or meropenem. Patients with other pathogens isolated other than CRAB in clinical specimens including respiratory specimens were excluded. Patients who used antibiotics for other purposes other than treatment for pneumonia due to CRAB were excluded from the analysis. VAP was defined as having a mechanical ventilator applied 48 hours before the onset of pneumonia. Results: A total of 257 patient with CRAB pneumonia was included in the analysis. The mean age of the patients was 67.5 \u00b1 14.8 years(range, 18-98)  and 69.3% (178) were males. Among the patients, 87.5% (225) had one or more underlying diseases. Hypertension (115, 44.7%), diabetes mellitus (77, 30.0%) and cerebrovascular disease (66, 25.7%) were the most common underlying diseases. CRAB bacteremia was accompanied in 26.5% (68) of the patients. Seventy percent of the patients (180, 70.0%) met the definition of VAP. The mean APACHE II score of the patients was 19.3 \u00b1 6.8 (range,  4-38)  and the SAPS II score was48.6 \u00b1 14.9 (range, 8-86). Intravenous colistin monotherapy was the most common selective antibiotic regimen used against CRAB pneumonia (53, 20.6%), and 63.4% (163) of the patients were treated with colistin-containing antibiotic regimen as a primary selective antibiotic regimen. Of the patients, 17.1% died within 7 days after the start of the selective antibiotic treatment, 37.0% within 28 days, and 43.7% died during the hospital stay. The mean duration of hospital stay was 34.0 \u00b1 37.2 days (range, 3-354); 19.7 \u00b1 22.0 days (range, for the patients died and 44.7 \u00b1 42.9 days (range, for the survivors. In the analysis of mortality according to the antibiotics regimens, 28-day mortality was significantly higher when the colistin-containing regimen was used (43.7% vs. 29.5%, p = 0.029), and 7-day mortality was significantly lower when the carbapenem-containing regimen was used (9.2% vs. 21.3%, p = 0.015). Subgroup analysis of colistincontaining regimens showed that 7-day mortality was significantly higher in the patients with colistin monotherapy than combined with other antibiotics (32.7% vs. 12.6%, p = 0.002). The combination regimen of colistin and carbapenem showed significantly low 7-day mortality rate than the patients with the other colistincontaining regimen (5.0% vs. 23.6%, p = 0.009). Conclusion: The use of a antibiotic regimen without colistin may result in better clinical outcome in the treatment of CRAB pneumonia. If colistin was used, the use of other antibiotics such as carbapenem in combination with colistin can be better. Given the limitations of this study, large, prospective and randomized trials should be conducted to compare and analyze the outcome according to the antibiotic regimens.P2-LB23 Molecular epidemiology and microbiological characteristics of multidrug-resistant non-extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamaseproducing Escherichia coli causing bacteremia M.K.

Song 1,2 . 1 Asia Pacific Foundation for Infectious Diseases (APFID), Seoul, Republic of Korea, 2 Division of Infectious Diseases, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of KoreaBackground: We evaluated the epidemiology and microbiological characteristics in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli causing bacteremia, with focus on nonsusceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC) and non-extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)producing isolates. Methods: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) non-ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were collected at Samsung Medical Center in South Korea. Resistance mechanisms were characterized by PCR and sequencing. To determine whether there were differences in the bla TEM expression level between isolates with high and low AMC MICs, quantitative real-time PCR was performed. Molecular epidemiology was studied by multilocus sequence typing. Results: A total of 56 isolates of AMC-nonsusceptible MDR non-ESBL-producing E. coli causing bacteremia were collected. The most frequent mechanism of resistance was the hyperproduction of TEM-1 (85.7%) enzymes. Seven (10.7%) isolates had OXA-1 and 2 (3.6%) isolates had inhibitor-resistant TEM \u03b2-lactamase. The relative expression of bla TEM\u22121 was significantly higher in three high AMC-resistant isolates than in three AMC-susceptible isolates. Of 36 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates, 14 (38.8%) isolates showed the same six substitutions in the regions of gyrA and parC. In total, 19.6% of the isolates were ST131, followed by ST1193 (19.6%), ST69 (14.3%), and ST73 (12.5%). Conclusion: AMC resistance was attributed to hyperproduction of TEM-1 \u03b2-lactamase in the majority of MDR non-ESBL-producing E. coli isolates. Although these isolates were genetically diverse, the epidemic ST131 clone was frequent. AMC and ciprofloxacinresistant isolates exhibited new combination of amino acid substitutions in gyrA and parC.P2-LB24 In vitro synergistic activity of antimicrobial agents in combination against clinical isolates of colistin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii J.H.

Department of Infectious Diseases, 2 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Asan Medical Center University of Ulsan, Seoul, Korea, Departmnet of Pathology, Seoul National University Boramae Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, KoreaBackgrounds: Emerging resistance to colistin in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumanii is of growing concern. Objectives: Since treatment options for these strains are extremely limited. we investigated in vitro activities of various antimicrobial combinations against colistin-resistance A. baumannii. Methods: Nine clinical isolates (8 from bacteremia and 1 from pneumonia) of colistin-resistance A. baumanii were collected in Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea between Jan 2010 and Dec 2012. To screen for potential synergistic efficacy, combinations of every two antimicrobials among12 commercially agents were tested using the multiple-combination bactericidal test (MCBT). Checkerboard tests were further performed to validate synergistic results in MCBT. Among 9 colistin-resistant strains, 6 were pandrug-resistant and 3 were extensively drug-resistant. In MCBT, the most effective combinations were colistin-rifampin and colistin-teicoplanin; in both of these combinations 8 of 9 strains were inhibited. Colistin-aztreonam, colistin-meropenem, and colisitin-vancomycin combinations showed inhibition of growth on seven strains. Colistin was the most common constituent of antimicrobial combinations active against colistin-resistant A. baumannii. Checkerboard tests were conducted in colistinbased combinations. Colistin-rifampin was fully synergistic against all strains. Both colisitin-vancomycin and colistin-teicoplanin showed either synergy or partial synergy. Conclusions: Using MCBT and checkerboard test, we found that only colistin-based combinations, particularly with rifampin, glycopeptides, or \u03b2-lactams can confer therapeutic benefit for colistin-resistnat A. baumannii infections.Keywords: Acinetobacter baumannii; colistinresistant; fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI); synergism P2-LB25 Characterization of colistin-resistant Escherichia coli with mcr-1 harboring plasmid Y.J.

Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, South Korea Background: Previously, colistin dependence, a phenomenon that bacteria grow only near the colistin disc, has been reported in Acinetobcter baumannii. In this study, we report development of colistin dependence in Acinetobacter nosocomialis after exposure to colistin. Methods: Species identification was performed using partial rpoB gene sequences. We performed colistin susceptibility testing for 75 non-baumannii Acinetobacter spp. isolates collected from intensive care units of a Korean hospitals in 2003-2015 and examined colistin dependence among colistin-susceptible isolates by using the population analysis and colistin disc method. We performed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for the isolates developing colistin dependence. Results: Thirty-one out of 34 colistin-susceptible A. nosocomialis isolates (91.2%) showed colistin heteroresistance. Among them, eight isolates (23.5%) developed colistin dependence. MLST analysis showed that the A. nosocomialis isolates developing colistin dependence belong to different clones. Conclusions: Our result suggests that colistin dependence is not restricted to A. baumannii.P2-LB28 Species distribution and molecular characteristics of CRE/CPE isolates from KoreaE.B. Go 1 *, S.J.

Widayanto 2 . 1 Departemen of Internal Medicine, Division of Infection and Tropical Disease, Indonesia Army Central Hospital-Gatot Soebroto, 2 Instalation of Clinical Pathology Laboratory, Indonesia Army Central Hospital -Gatot Soebroto Background: Antimicrobial resistance is global problems and has become attention nationally in Indonesia, by publishing the regulation of Minister of Health no 8 year 2015 about the antimicrobial stewardship programs. As the first step of effort to carry out the program, the hospital conduct mapping the epidemiological data of the Multi Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO). Methods: A retrospective review of MDRO records has been conducted throughout the period from July 2016 until June 2017.Organism were identified and tested by an automated identification and susceptibility tests using Vitek 2 compact system for aerobic gram negative rods, aerobic gram positive coccus and yeasts. Antibiotics susceptibility testing was confirmed by disk diffusion method. Results: Out of total 310,778 admissions, there have been 1048 patients with MDRO, excluding data tuberculosis resistant. Giving an overall prevalence rate 3.4 per 1000 (3.4\u2030) admissions. In additions, the total Laboratory Identification rates of MDRO were 1048 per 3714 isolates (28%), when described by type of isolates are as follows: Methycillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 17 of 118 Staphylococcus aureus isolates (14.4%), the total of Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) were 441 of 819 isolates (54%) consist of Klebsiella pneumonia, 211 of 589 isolates (36%), Eschericia coli, 228 of 330 isolates (69%) and Klebsiella Oxytoca 2 of 14 isolates (14%). There were 151 Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) organism of 230 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (66%) and 306 of 349 Acinobacter baumanni isolates (88%). Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus (VRE) were found in 6 of 96 Enterococcus faecalis isolates (6.25%) and 2 of 30 Enterococcus faecium isolates (6.7%). Possibility of Pan Drug Resistant (PDR) were found in 50 of 230 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (22%) and 52 of 349 Acinobacter baumannii isolates (15%). There were no MDRO in 500 yeasts isolates. Conclusion: The overall prevalences 3.4 cases per 1000 admissions were lower compared to prevalence rate in a teaching hospital in Oman 10.8 cases per 1000 admissions. Although the overall prevalence were low, the total laboratory identification rates of MDRO (28%) are still an emerging challenge. Continuious monitoring of hospital antibiogram and data of MDRO, and strict adherences to infection prevention guidelines are essential to overcome the antimicrobial resistance problems in hospital. Along such quest, restrictions of antibiotics prescriptions are needed.P2-LB31 Risk factors for community-onset pneumococcal pneumonia caused by levofloxacin non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae H.

The Catholic university of Korea Introduction: Health care workers (HCW) have been at a high risk of acquired tuberculosis, therefore screening and treatment of latent tuberculosis (LTBI) is one of methods to decrease tuberculosis transmission in health care settings. This study was estimated prevalence of LTBI among HCWs and compliance of LTBI treatment. Methods: A total of 926HCWs who performed regular health screening including QuantiFERON-TB Gold for LTBI screening in 2017 were enrolled. HCWs with positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold result were recommended to meet infectious disease specialist by Infection prevention and control department of hospital, and offered LTBI treatment. Results: Among a total of 926 HCWs, 374 (40.3%) had positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold results and this was estimated 20% in thirties, 36.3% in forties, 44.8% in fifties and 53.4% in sixties. Only 66.0% (n = 247) of HCWs with positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold results met infectious disease doctor. Among 238 HCW without previous tuberculosis history, 157 (65.9%) accepted LTBI treatment.

Kim 1 . 1 Department of Internal Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju, South Korea, 2 Department of Laboratory Medicine, Wonju College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Wonju, South Korea Background: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel bunyavirus, designated SFTS virus (SFTSV) with a high fatality rate. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an immunemediated life-threatening disease triggered by various infectious and noninfectious diseases. A few SFTS-associated with HLH were reported. Seven SFTS patients with bone marrow (BM) study were reviewed. Material and Methods: Between October 2015 and June 2017, 17 SFTS patients were diagnosed at the Wonju Severance Christian Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju College of Medicine, Wonju, South Korea. BM was examined in 7 patients among them. We described if the mortality of SFTS patients was associated with diagnostic criteria of 2004-HLH trial. Results: Hemophagocytosis was observed in BM of all 7 patients. Five patients met the diagnostic criteria of 2004-HLH trial (five of eight criteria) and two patients were fulfilled the four criteria although NK cell activity and soluble CD25 were not measured. Five of 7 patients (71.4%) were died. Among them, four met the diagnostic criteria of HLH and one met only 4 criteria. Conclusions: Hemophagocytosis was commonly observed in BM with SFTS patients.

One Health approach to AMR may produce meaningful data to enable analysis of the occurrence and transmission of AMR, and establish prevention and control programs against AMR. Background: Bovine colostrum is the first milk produced by cows during the initial days after giving birth. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most predominant immunoglobulin in colostrum of cows. This study investigated prevalence of IgG in bovine colostrum and colostrum products.Methods: A total of 15 colostrum samples were collected from healthy bovine (n = 5) at the first (within 3h), second (12h), third (24h) milking postpartum. A total of 12 colostrum replacement products were collected from domestic farms. The concentrations of IgG in the all samples were measured by commercial bovine IgG ELISA kits following the procedures recommended by the manufacture.Results: The IgG concentrations of the colostrum by milking time ranged from 32.9-68.5 mg/ml, 7.6-53.3 mg/ml and 3.8-25.7 mg/ ml, respectively. The IgG of colostrum replacement products reveled that dry colostrum (62.4 mg/ml), frozen colostrums (38.7, 35.8, 10.8 mg/ml), immune booster ( powder; 11. 2, 9.8, 9.2 Gold assay. Among the 47 patients with gastrointestinal involvement, QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay was positive in 39 (83%), 16 (61.5%) were positive in skeletal TB, and 100% in with disseminated extrapulmonary TB. The sensitivity in the proven and probable group was 79%, specificity was 42.6%, positive predictive value was 69.2% and negative predictive value was 44.6%. Conclusion: QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay was not useful diagnostic method for extrapulmonary tuberculosis in BCG vaccinated intermediate-TB endemic area. Despite of negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay result, physicians should not ignore the possibility of tuberculosis in patients with suspected TB clinically.",

Department of Biomedical Science, and Medical Zoology, Kyung Hee University School of Medicine, Seoul, South KoreaBackground: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major infectious disease that causes the highest human mortality, particularly in Africa, around the world. This study was carried out to evaluate anti-Mtb effect of a compound (named WK2015001) that causes inhibitory activity against the growth and proliferation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).Methods: The anti-Mtb activity of WK2015001 was determined using different anti-Mtb indicator methods such as resazurin microtiter assay (REMA), Ogawa slant medium assay, and MGIT 960 system assay. The Mtb was incubated with various concentrations (0.5-16 \u00b5g/mL) of the compound and anti-Mtb first-line drugs for 6 days in the REMA, and for 4 weeks in MGIT 960 system assay.Results: WK2015001 indicated the anti-Mtb effect by strongly inhibiting the growth and proliferation of Mtb in a dose-dependent manner in the REMA, Ogawa slant medium assay and the MGIT 960 system assay. In particular, WK2015001consistently induced anti-Mtb activity by effectively inhibiting the growth and proliferation of Mtb in MGIT 960 system for 4 weeks with a single treatment, and its minimum inhibitory concentration was measured as 5 \u00b5g/mL. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that WK2015001 not only have the selective anti-Mtb effect/properties, but also induces effectively anti-Mtb activity by strongly inhibiting the growth and proliferation of Mtb through blocking signaling pathways of Mtb. Therefore, this study suggests the potential that the compound can be used as effective anti-Mtb candidate agents of next-generation for developing a new anti-tuberculosis drug against the global challenge of TB. When it comes to E. coli system, cell growth is fast, the medium price is affordable and expression levels are high. However, the absence of refolding by insolubility of produced protein makes folding impossible, a critical defection of such system. But we recently developed chaperna such as RID that enhance protein solubility and folding. We expressed RBD as target antigen instead of spike protein. Also, HR2 (heptad repeats) was expressed for target antigen and showed diagnostic effectiveness. These data demonstrate that using this RNA-dependent protein folding technology, diagnostic platform could be established through production of recombinant antigen of even a virus with a high casualty rate and pandemic occurrence.",
