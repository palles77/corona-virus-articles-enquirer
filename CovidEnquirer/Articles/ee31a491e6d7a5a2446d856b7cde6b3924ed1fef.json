HO-1 induction was recently shown to result in anti-HCV activity by inducing type I interferon and inhibiting hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease activity. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the anti-HCV activity of celastrol and characterize its mechanism of inhibition. Methods: The anti-HCV activity of celastrol was evaluated using the HCV subgenomic replicon and HCVcc infection systems. The anti-HCV mechanism of celastrol targeting HO-1 expression was clarified using specific inhibitors against several signaling pathways. The transcriptional regulation of celastrol on target gene expression was determined using promoter-based reporter activity assay. The synergistic effect of celastrol and a numbers of clinically used anti-HCV drugs was determined via a drug combination assay. Results: Celastrol inhibited HCV replication in both the HCV subgenomic and HCVcc infection systems with EC50 values of 0.37 \u00b1 0.022 and 0.43 \u00b1 0.019 mM, respectively. Celastrol-induced heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression promoted antiviral interferon responses and inhibition of NS3/4A protease activity, thereby blocking HCV replication. These antiviral effects were abrogated by treatment with the HO-1specific inhibitor SnMP or silencing of HO-1 expression by transfection of shRNA, which indicates that HO-1 induction contributes to the anti-HCV activity of celastrol. JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were confirmed to be involved in the inductive effect of celastrol on HO-1 expression. Celastrol exhibited synergistic effects in combination with interferon-alpha, the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir, and the NS5B inhibitor sofosbuvir. Conclusion: Celastrol can serve as a potential supplement for blocking HCV replication. Targeting the JNK/Nrf2/HO-1 axis presents a promising strategy against HCV infection.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Hepacivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family (Brass et al., 2006) . The genome of the virus includes 9600 base pairs encoding 4 structural proteins (C, E1, E2 and p7) and 6 nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) (Brass et al., 2006) . HCV infection is a risk factor of chronic liver diseases, including cirrhosis, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV-infected patients have been estimated to number up to 200 million worldwide (Alter, 2007) . In the past, the standard of care (SOC) for HCV infection is treatment with a combination of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN-a) and ribavirin (RBV); however, the efficacy of this treatment is only 40%e50% in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV (Ghany et al., 2009) . As well, this SOC therapy is associated with several adverse effects, such as anemia, headache, fatigue and depression (Schoggins et al., 2011) . In 2011, telaprevir and boceprevir, the first DAAs were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and found to exhibited higher rates of sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV when combined with PEG-IFN-a, which provided a new SOC for the treatment of chronic HCV infection (Kiser et al., 2012) . Despite the increasing efficacy of the treatment modes developed for HCV infection, however, undesirable side effects continue to be observed during therapy (Kiser et al., 2012) . The FDA recently approved the two-agent combo Harvoni and the fouragent combo Viekira Pak for distribution; these treatments could achieve SVRs up to 95% in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV (Koretz, 2014) . Unfortunately, while these antiviral agents achieve higher rates of SVR while avoiding the adverse effects often induced by IFN (Koretz, 2014) , they also exist the risk to reactivate the hepatitis B virus (HBV) in treating patients with HCV and HBV co-infection (Yeh et al., 2017) . Moreover, these two drugs relatively more expensive than other drugs. Thus, development of a more safety and cost-effective substitute for treatment is an important endeavor.",

            "text": "HO-1 is an inducible and rate-limiting enzyme that degrades heme to produce biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO) and ferrous iron (Fe3\u00fe) via the heme catabolic pathway (Maines, 2005) . The enzyme and its metabolites exhibit protective effects against oxidative stress-induced tissue damage upon exposure to multiple stimuli such as viral and bacterial products including lipopolysaccharides, cytokines, oncogenes, mitogens, and various growth factors (Farombi and Surh, 2006; Paine et al., 2010) . Upon HCV infection, down-regulation of HO-1 expression has been observed in HCV-infected patients and HCV core protein expression although the biological role of HO-1 suppression and the detailed mechanism of HCV against HO-1 expression were unclear (Abdalla et al., 2004) . HO-1 is a detoxifying enzyme that is mainly regulated by Nrf2 (Shan et al., 2006) . Activation of HO-1 expression occurs when Nrf2 binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) of the HO-1 promoter region. By contrast, BACH1 suppresses HO-1 expression by competing with the ARE binding site (Shan et al., 2006) . Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by Kelchlike ECH-associated protein (Keap1)-mediated proteasome degradation (Shan et al., 2006) . Upregulating Nrf2/ARE-dependent HO-1 expression to achieve anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress functions is mediated by several host factors, including the mitogene-activated protein kinase (MAPK) molecules p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and c-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK) (Paine et al., 2010) . In this study, our data revealed that celastrol significantly inhibits HCV replication, and that the anti-HCV effect of celastrol was attenuated by the HO-1 specific inhibitor tin mesoporphyrin (SnMP) or HO-1 gene expression silencing. Celastrol-mediated HO-1 induction contributed to the anti-HCV action through inducing antiviral IFN response and inhibiting HCV NS3 protease activity. Moreover, the JNK/Nrf2/ ARE axis was the critical pathway involved in celastrol-mediated HO-1 induction against HCV replication. Combinations of celastrol and IFN-a, sofosbuvir or daclatasvir were tested to determine their ability to enhance of anti-HCV activity.",

We first examined whether celastrol could induce HO-1 expression by determining HO-1 promoter activity, as well as HO-1 RNA and protein levels, in Ava5 cells in the presence of celastrol. Ava5 cells were transfected pHO-1-Luc containing a firefly luciferase gene driven by the HO-1 promoter. Then, the transfected-cells were treated with celastrol at increasing concentrations for 3 days and subjected to luciferase activity assay. The results indicated that celastrol significantly induced the HO-1 promoter activity in a concentrationdependent manner ( Fig. 2A) . As expected, the HO-1 RNA and protein levels were also dose-dependently induced by celastrol ( Fig. 2B and C). To investigate whether celastrol-induced HO-1 expression is involved in the anti-HCV activity of celastrol, Ava5 cells were cotreated with a fixed concentration of celastrol and increasing concentrations HO-1 specific inhibitor SnMP for 3 days. Western blotting assay was preformed to determine the restorative effect of SnMP on HCV protein synthesis upon celastrol treatment. As shown in Fig. 2D , celastrol inhibited HCV protein synthesis compared with non-celastrol treated cells (lanes 1 and 2) By contrast, SnMP treatment dose-dependently attenuated the suppressive effect of celastrol on HCV protein synthesis (lanes 3e5). As expect, the HO-1 specific shRNA mediated HO-1 gene silencing also can attenuate the suppressive effect of celastrol on HCV protein synthesis (Fig. 2E) .

We next measured IFN-a protein secretion levels in the culture medium after celastrol treatment. As expected, ELISA results indicated that IFN-a protein secretion levels were gradually induced by celastrol after 3 days of treatment (Fig. 3C ). An antiviral effect on cells may be attributed to the interaction of IFN-a and cell surface IFN-a receptors, leading to the activation of ISRE and upregulation of downstream antiviral genes (Yu et al., 2017b) . To evaluate whether celastrol-induced IFNa could activate downstream antiviral genes, ISRE activity and the expression of three critical IFN-mediated antiviral genes, including 2 0 -5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase 1e3 (OAS1e3), were measured. Ava5 cells were transfected with ISRE-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmid followed by treatment with celastrol for 3 days. Luciferase assay results indicated that the ISRE promoter activity was increased by approximately 2.8e6.5-fold by celastrol (Fig. 4A ).

We then examined the Nrf2-mediated ARE activation caused by celastrol. Here, Ava5 cells were transfected with ARE-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. The transfected-cells were treated with increasing concentrations of celastrol for 3 days. As expected, ARE-driven firefly luciferase activity was elevated by celastrol in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 6B ).

Given that the activation of Nrf2 nuclear translocation is regulated by Keap1dependent ubiquitination and Bach1, a competitor of Nrf2 for binding to ARE in the HO-1 promoter region (Maines, 2005) , future studies should be performed to determine whether celastrol alters the expression levels of Keap-1 or Bach1 for regulating HO-1 induction. Knowledge in this area will help provide alternative targets for screening anti-HCV agents. We further found that the HO-1 inductive effect of the celastrol was also associated with JNK activity (Fig. 7) . However, several kinases are involved in JNK activation, including mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), MKK7 and mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs) (Wasserman et al., 2010) . Future studies should examine the effect of celastrol on the kinases involved in JNK activation comprehensively describe the relationship between celastrol and HO-1 induction. Several studies have indicated that celastrol exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and downstream cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) (Ding et al., 2013; Joshi et al., 2016) . On the basis of earlier findings on a promising tactic against HCV infection via down-regulation of NF-kB-mediated COX-2 expression Lee et al., 2011b) , we propose that the inhibitory effect of celastrol on NF-kB-mediated COX-2 expression may, at least in part contribute to its anti-HCV activity. Hence, more work is necessary to elucidate additional signaling pathways involved in the anti-HCV activity of celastrol.",

The two-agent combo Harvoni and the four-agent combo Viekira Pak, which could achieve the SVRs of up to 95% in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV. However, the low fidelity of HCV polymerase during viral replication may lead to the emergence of drug resistance, which poses a major challenge in treating HCV infection (Lee et al., 2014) . Targeting host factors could be an alternative strategy to eliminate drug resistance in HCV therapeutic regimens because the mutation rate of the host genome is lower than that of the RNA virus genome (Liao et al., 2008) . In this study, we showed that celastrol can be considered as a suitable candidate for HCV therapy to minimize the risk of drug resistance by targeting host HO-1 signaling pathway and synergistically inhibiting HCV replication in combination with clinically used drugs against different viral targets (Table 1) . Further studies are warranted to clarify the potential clinical relevance of our findings.",
