            "text": "In 2006, investigators from several Chinese provinces reported a unique syndrome in growing swine that was highlighted by the predominant clinical signs of high fever, anorexia, listlessness, red discoloration of skin, respiratory distress and very high morbidity and mortality rates (Li et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2007; Tong et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2008) . Originally known as porcine high fever disease (PHFD), this syndrome spread to Vietnam in 2006 and to Cambodia, Laos, The Philippines, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, South Korea and Russia in later years Feng et al., 2008) . Although there was concern that this syndrome may have been caused by a new disease agent, extensive diagnostic testing revealed only known pathogens. One consistent finding was the detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) with two discontinuous deletions in the replicase polyprotein known as nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2), and two single nucleotide deletions in the 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions (UTRs) (Zhou and Yang, 2010) . Experimental infection of Chinese swine with the initial novel PRRSV field isolates reproduced the clinical disease (Li et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2007; Tong et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2008) , providing strong evidence for its role as the causal agent of PHFD. Since the severity of the clinical disease was greater than expected for a typical PRRSV infection, there remained the chance that an unknown agent in the PRRSV isolates exacerbated the disease symptoms. This question was resolved when PHFD was reproduced in Chinese swine with virus derived from an infectious clone of the JX143 PRRSV isolate (Lv et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "The prior studies demonstrated that PRRSV isolates with a common genetic pattern had a causal role in PHFD, leading to the new designation of this viral lineage as highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV). The presence of the unique nsp2 deletion motif was initially thought to contribute to the severity of disease (Tian et al., 2007) . However, studies showed that the nsp2 region of HP-PRRSV strain rJXwn06 containing the novel deletion could be replaced with 458 amino acids from low virulence strain HB-1/3.9 to result in a chimeric virus with only a minor delay in mortality (Zhou et al., 2009) . There was also concern that there may be some unique aspect that may predispose Asian pigs to a severe outcome, e.g., husbandry practices, endemic infections with other pathogens, climate, or host genetics. Although a number of experiments have associated genetic changes in PRRSV with an attenuation phenotype using point mutations (Grebennikova et al., 2004; Nielsen et al., 2001; Storgaard et al., 1999) or by the construction of chimeric viruses (Ellingson et al., 2010; Kwon et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2009 ), there appears to be no single locus for which mutations confer a predictable change in virulence. Collectively, this area of study suggests the factors that contribute to PRRSV pathogenicity are complex and viral strain-specific .",

Members of this highly variable virus have been grouped into two genotypes, Type 1 (European-like, prototype strain Lelystad) or Type 2 (North American, prototype strain VR-2332), which differ in nucleotide similarity by approximately 45% (Nelsen et al., 1999) . Both genotypes have representatives of varying pathogenicity, and intragenic nucleotide sequence variation in each can be as much as 20% (Shi et al., 2010) . For this study, we imported a plasmid containing the cDNA copy of the HP-PRRSV strain rJXwn06 genome, a Type 2 PRRSV genome that is 15,321 bases in length and has 89% pairwise nucleotide identity to the prototype genome of VR-2332 (Zhou et al., 2009) . To investigate the pathogenesis of HP-PRRSV infection and the potential contribution of climate, host genetics, commensal bacteria, other environmental conditions and husbandry practices to the pathogenicity of HP-PRRSV in U.S. swine, we compared and contrasted the pathogenicity of rescued JXwn06 (rJXwn06) virus to that of VR-2332 in 10-week old swine. We found that this HP-PRRSV strain caused extreme morbidity, as was seen in Asia, but novel to this study, resulted in up to 100x higher abundance of circulating virus when compared to VR-2332, caused extremely exacerbated thymic atrophy such that the thymus was often difficult to discern, and the host response was assessed in comparison to animals infected with strain VR-2332 for the first time by a swine protein array including 5 innate and 5 adaptive cytokines in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lymph nodes. Moreover, we completed bacterial speciation and loads after necropsy and specified the degree of weight loss seen. Lastly, we showed that HP-PRRSV readily transmitted to contact swine causing a different pattern of cytokine responses. As a result of our study, the remaining plausible contributing factors to the high virulence seen in Asia were discredited, and thus HP-PRRSV strains pose a serious threat to the U.S. swine industry.",

As a group, the pigs developed fevers, became listless, anorexic, and began shivering and huddling together in a pile. Clinical signs became more severe over the next few days, with pigs rapidly losing body weight (Fig. 1) , becoming dehydrated and weak. Respiratory distress, characterized by dyspnea, tachypnea and coughing was common in all pigs. Erythema of the skin was present in most of the pigs, and several developed cutaneous hemorrhages and cyanotic extremities (blue ears) (Fig. 2 ). On 7 dpe, one pig from Group 2 was found dead. Two others were euthanized due to severe weakness and moribund condition on dpe 8 and 9, and one was found dead on dpe 13. On 10 and 11 dpe, clinical signs of disease in some of the HP-PRRSV challenged group began to decrease in severity. While pigs remained huddled in a pile with respiratory signs, approximately half of them were subjectively less listless, would move away when approached and began showing an interest in feed again. During the study, contact pigs displayed similar clinical signs as those challenged with HP-PRRSV . Pigs challenged with VR-2332 (Group 4) were clinically normal until dpe 7, when they began to exhibit slightly increased respiratory rates and became a little less active than the control group. One pig from the VR-2332 group was found dead on dpe 9; however, the cause of death was attributed to gastric dilatation and volvulus, rather than to clinical disease typical of PRRSV strain VR-2332 . Control pigs (Group 1) remained clinically normal for the duration of the study.",

Lungs and representative lesions are shown in Fig. 2 . No pathologic lesions were identified in control pigs (Group 1). Pigs in the VR-2332 challenge group (Group 4) had diffuse interstitial pneumonia, characteristic of an uncomplicated PRRSV infection.

Lymphadenopathy was present in all infected pigs (Groups 2-4 ), with no statistically significant difference between HP-PRRSV and VR-2332 infected groups (Fig. 4A ). Thymic atrophy was also a common finding in infected pigs and was significantly more severe in HP-PRRSV infected and contact pigs compared to VR-2332 infected pigs (P \u00bc0.0003 and Po0.0001; Fig. 4B ).

Overall, gross pathology lesions in the rJXwn06 challenged and contact groups were much more extensive and not restricted solely to the respiratory tract and lymph nodes as was the case with the VR-2332 challenged pigs. The high occurrence of bacterial co-infections in the rJXwn06 challenge and contact swine likely played a prominent role in the difference in pathology and clinical disease between groups. Bacterial co-infections in pigs naturally infected with PRRSV have been documented, with susceptibility attributed to factors including PRRSV strain differences, host genetics, management practices and environmental factors (Rossow, 1998) . In this study, we used swine of high health status in a controlled research environment that were from 2-and 3-way crosses of commercial genetic lines. We believe the incidence and magnitude of bacteria isolated from the rJXwn06 challenge and contact groups when compared to the VR-2332 and control groups suggest the differences in secondary bacterial infection susceptibility are specific to viral strain. In this study, we observed a 30% mortality rate in rJXwn06 infected pigs by 13 dpe, which is less mortality than the original report (Zhou et al., 2009) , but similar to other HP-PRRSV strains used (Li et al., 2007; Lv et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008) . Possible explanations for differences may be the route and dose of inoculation, the age of pigs, the HP-PRRSV strain utilized, and the time course of study. In addition, since the HP-PRRSV lineage may exacerbate subclinical bacterial infections, it is possible different endemic bacterial infections played a role in apparent different mortality rates.",

Upon histopathologic examination of tissues from this study, North American pigs directly inoculated with rJXwn06, as well as contact pigs, had an interstitial pneumonia that was significantly more severe than the VR-2332 inoculated group, which is consistent with the severity of disease reported in China. Although pulmonary lesions were more severe in the rJXwn06 challenge and contact pigs, the amount of antigen labeling was not significantly different from the VR-2332 inoculated swine. Since levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFa, IL-1 b and IL-8, were significantly increased in the BALF of rJXwn06-inoculated and contact pigs, the host response to HP-PRRSV may play a role in the augmented lung pathology seen. In addition, the increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections in rJXwn06 challenge and contact pigs may have contributed to increased cytokine production and resultant immunopathology.",

            "text": "There are numerous reports about the interplay of PRRSV with the swine immune system that describe variable responses to infection at the cellular and cytokine level (Miguel et al., 2010; Thanawongnuwech et al., 2004; Thanawongnuwech and Thacker, 2003; Wang et al., 2011) . Although a large part of this variability may result from differing methods, challenge viruses, outbred pigs, and experimental designs, there are consistent findings emerging among the studies of increases in levels of selected cytokines associated with both innate and adaptive immunity. Here we report a comprehensive assessment of the effects of PRRSV infection on levels of cytokines critical to innate (IFNa/b, TNFa, IL-1 b, IL6 and IL-8) and adaptive (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNg) immune systems in serum, BALF and TBLN homogenates. It was demonstrated that infection with a highly pathogenic strain of PRRSV elicited a significant elevation of all adaptive immunity cytokines measured in BALF, as well as a majority of these cytokines in serum and TBLN homogenates of the same groups of pigs. This observation is consistent with previous reports of Table 3 Changes in cytokine levels in sampled tissues relative to non-challenged control pigs (P-values in comparison to non-challenged controls). Serum values are an area under the curve overall average level measured in samples collected after exposure to virus. Geometric means back-calculated from Log10 means were used to determine relative changes in TBLN and BALF cytokine levels compared to sham-inoculated controls. (Sun et al., 2012) ]. In contrast, in pigs infected in this study with rJXwn06, we observed significant elevations of serum IFNa as the first cytokine to peak following exposure to rJXwn06 in either the directly challenged or contact pigs, with the zenith occurring 4 and 2 dpe, respectively. However, consistent with a previous study (Gomez-Laguna et al., 2009 ), elevated serum IFNa had little to no apparent effect on virus clearance as the viremia peaked in the rJXwn06 challenge and contact pigs on dpe 7 and 4, respectively, and remained above the serum virus levels of VR-2332 pigs until the end of the study (11 and 13 dpe). It is well documented that PRRSV infection will increase the susceptibility of swine to co-infection with various bacteria (Brockmeier et al., 2001; Thanawongnuwech et al., 2004; Thanawongnuwech and Thacker, 2003; Thanawongnuwech et al., 1997; Thanawongnuwech et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2010) , and based on previous findings with other HP-PRRSV strains (Xu et al., 2010) and our current rJXwn06 findings, it is clear that exposure to HP-PRRSV greatly increases the likelihood of secondary bacterial infection due to commensal or pathogenic organisms typically found in the swine upper respiratory tract. Whether the significant elevations of multiple cytokines that were measured in serum, BALF and TBLN following exposure to rJXwn06 were a direct result of the virus, an indirect effect mediated by the secondary bacterial infections, from extensive host tissue damage, or a combination of all of these events cannot be determined from our experiments. However, the pattern of multiple cytokines being elevated nearly simultaneously in serum (8 of 10 cytokines in rJXwn06 contact pigs and 5 of 10 cytokines in direct inoculated pigs) has not previously been reported and was not detected in VR-2332 infected swine. Cytokines are a diverse collection of peptides that elicit a wide range of biological responses and are characteristically understood in the context of an immune response wherein inflammation and immunity are carefully orchestrated by sequential secretion of cytokines that coordinate innate and adaptive immune responses. Macrophages and stressed or damaged cells typically initiate a cytokine cascade through secretion of chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines in order to initiate the innate immune response at sites of acute infection or damage. Generally, they act locally at nano-to picogram levels with short half-lives and transient activity. However, inflammatory cytokine cascades classically comprise a sequential appearance and disappearance of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFa, IL-1 and IL-6) intended to activate immune cells and their recruitment to generate additional cytokines and chemokines. This initial wave of cytokine production is usually followed by anti-inflammatory cytokine production (mainly the IL-10 family) to moderate or down regulate the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Cytokine cascades are therefore usually sequential with transiently detectable levels in peripheral blood; any dysregulation of these cascades can lead to adverse immunopathological responses.",

Two recent studies have reported HP-PRRSV infection in swine results in down regulation of a key toll-like receptor adapter gene, SARM1 (sterile aand armadillomotif-containing protein) (Zhou et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012) . SARM1 normally dampens the proinflammatory immune response by attenuating NF-kB activation and decreasing expression of IL1, IL-8 and TNFa (Carty et al., 2006) . Previous studies in pigs infected with strains of HP-PRRSV were reported to have swollen livers and petechial hemorrhages on the kidneys as well as immunohistochemical staining evidence of viral antigen in the liver and kidneys (among other tissues) (Li et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2007) . Impaired hepatic and renal function as a consequence of viral or secondary bacterial disease could have a significant effect on clearance of the cytokines detected in serum, and contribute to an apparent severe cytokine release syndrome.",

However, given PRRSV causes polyclonal B cell activation, autoimmunity, lymphoid hyperplasia and hypergammaglobulinemia in pigs (Lemke et al., 2004) , and it modulates multiple intracellular signaling pathways [reviewed in (Sun et al., 2012) ], it is not surprising to find an exaggerated immune stimulation in swine infected with a particularly virulent strain of PRRSV. Early studies with cytokine administration to livestock species identified potential toxicities associated with systemic cytokine administration. Interferon-g was found to have beneficial activity on immune function but was too toxic for practical usage due to febrile responses observed within 24 h of a single dose of 1.25 mg/ kg of body weight (Roth and Frank, 1989) . Similarly, administration of 166 ng of bovine IL-1 b/kg of body weight every 8 h for 4 days caused transient fever, inappetence, increased pulse and respiratory rate, and diuresis (Goff et al., 1992) . Blood cytokines have been proposed as biomarkers of in vivo toxicity associated with new drug development (Tarrant, 2010) . Under most disease scenarios where there is rapid resolution of the infection by the host immune response, much of the biological activity of cytokines will occur in the locally infected tissues and elevated levels of the cytokines may not be detected in serum.",

However, the association between the elevated levels of multiple cytokines and the severe morbidity and high mortality reported is consistent with a multiple cytokine toxicity syndrome in humans associated with various therapeutics (Tarrant, 2010) . Adverse reactions ranging from mild-to-moderate flu-like reactions to severe cytokine release syndromes have been observed with many therapeutic proteins in current use in human medicine, and some result in severe and even potentially life-threatening syndromes (reviewed in (Tarrant, 2010) ). Macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine storm are different names for two syndromes that share many features including a massive inflammatory response, elevated serum cytokine levels, multiorgan system disease and often death (Behrens et al., 2011) . Although these syndromes may be clinically indistinguishable, the cytokines that predominate in each may differ with TNFa being dominant in bacterial sepsis and IFNg predominate in the macrophage activation syndrome (Behrens et al., 2011) . The exact pathophysiology of the systemic toxicity in these syndromes is not fully defined. In pigs infected by natural contact with rJXwn06 inoculated pigs, we detected significant serum elevations in IFNa, TNFa, IL-1 b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNg. However, given that PRRSV infects the macrophage cell line in pigs, the elevated serum cytokine levels in pigs infected with HP-PRRSV may represent both conditions (macrophage activation syndrome and cytokine storm) and contribute to the multiorgan damage and high mortality reported here.",
