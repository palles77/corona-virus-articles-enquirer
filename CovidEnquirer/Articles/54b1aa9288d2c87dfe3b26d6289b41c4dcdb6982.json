When the hosts are humans, emerging viruses can present major public health issues, as exemplified by the AIDS pandemic. Therefore, heuristic approaches to identify nascent diseases before they become pandemic would be valuable. Unfortunately, the current patient-based and epidemiological approaches are ill-suited in this regard because they are largely responsive and not predictive. Alternative approaches based on virus evolutionary ecology might have greater potential to predict virus emergence. However, given the difficulties encountered when studying metazoan viruses in this context, the development of new model systems is greatly desirable.",

Ideally this research will permit identifying major factors determining the persistence or extinction of emerging viruses. If such viruses could be recognized in advance, patientbased and epidemiological strategies could be better mobilized to deal with them. New approaches to virus emergence Emerging viruses (EVs) are those that have entered new populations of hosts [1] . Recent emergence events, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and most recently Influenza A H1N1 (swine flu), have captured the popular imagination for their perceived (or actual) threat to humanity. Given that direct-contact transmitted HIV has caused around 60 million infections and 30 million deaths [2] , the fear of a highly pathogenic airborne pathogen is justified. Because of the potential for a devastating pandemic, EVs have been identified as an existential threat to civilization [3] .",

The conventional Review Glossary Coupon-collection problem: problem in probability theory that refers to ''collect all coupons and win'' contests and asks how many samples from a population of coupons are required to collect one of each type. Demographic stochasticity: fluctuations in population size owing to random demographic events. Fitness tradeoff: situation where an increase in fitness in one context is opposed by a decrease in fitness owing to concomitant changes in another context. Gene flow: transfer of alleles from one population to another by interbreeding or migration. Horizontal and vertical transmission: pathogens can spread either horizontally from one host to another or vertically from parent to offspring. Muller's ratchet: a characteristic of an asexual population that prevents any lineage in the population from attaining a mutation load lower than that already existing in its least loaded lineage. Mutation accumulation experiments: experiments that serially passage organisms with extreme bottlenecks such that selection against deleterious mutations is effectively eliminated. Mutational load: reduction in population fitness owing to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. Mutational meltdown: process by which a population accumulates deleterious mutations, which leads to loss of fitness and decline of the population size, which could lead to further accumulation of deleterious mutations owing to inbreeding depression. Niche evolution: population adaptation to a sink habitat such that it can persist in the absence of migration. Optimal foraging theory: idea that natural selection favors organisms that maximize net energy gain per unit feeding time while pursuing sustenance. Sequence space: all permutations of a DNA, RNA or amino acid sequence of a given length. wisdom is that, if we want to understand emergence, viruses should be studied in vivo or in mammalian cell culture models. However, from an evolutionary epidemiological standpoint, this approach is often impractical. In general, mammalian cell culture is somewhat trickier and more expensive than bacterial culture (even with regard to the relatively simple culture of HeLa) [20] . Cultured cells grow slowly and are prone to degeneration [21] , contamination [22, 23] , contact inhibition and differentiation [20] confounding results. Other factors include the fact that most primary cells have a limited lifespan (hence the requirement for immortalized cell lines) and are less amenable to reverse genetics. Multihost cell systems only compound these issues. Finally, cell culture removes cells from the whole organism context, thus negating one of its supposed advantages.",

This specific prediction can be tested by collecting and sequencing a large pool of host range mutants. Currently, the model takes into account differential mutation probabilities (e.g. transitions more likely than transversions) but refinement is probably required. For example, the model can be further constrained by considering codon bias. What mutation giveth, mutation also taketh away. An EV infecting a new host type can be likened to a single founder event in a new habitat. Founder effects commonly include reductions in fitness and genetic diversity [27] . The primary means of recovering genetic diversity is by mutation, but it has been shown that the majority of new mutations are deleterious [28] . Thus, the effects of emergence under these conditions could be analogous to a mutation-accumulation experiment. Here, organisms are serially passaged with severe bottlenecking on each passage such that ability of natural selection to remove nonlethal deleterious mutations is abolished. Bottlenecking inherent in the virus transmission process is probably exacerbated for EVs where within-host reproduction is low [29] . Such bottlenecking has been demonstrated to significantly reduce fitness with the phage MS2 [30] . Here, 20 passages with bottlenecking were sufficient to reduce phage fitness by almost two orders of magnitude. Given that each round of bottlenecking led to a fitness loss (up to 16% in some cases), within-host reproduction is expected to be reduced, thus probably increasing the bottleneck for future transmission events. As such, populations stuck in such demographic traps can rapidly become unsustainable.",

Theoretical models suggest that parasites will evolve an optimal level of virulence based on a fitness tradeoff between within-host growth and between-host transmission [34, 35] . Excessive virulence will lead to host death before transmission is effected and therefore leads to reductions in virus fitness. Empirical data from bacteriophage support this point. In phage F6 infections of P. phaseolicola, a negative correlation was observed between initial viral inoculum and virus growth rate [36] . The presumed mechanism for this result was a ''tragedy of the commons'' phenomenon where the renewable resource (bacterial hosts) was killed off before they had an opportunity to reproduce, thus reducing system-wide phage productivity. By contrast, insufficient virulence results in transmission failure and/or susceptibility to within-host competition from other genotypes.",

            "text": "Evidence for a tradeoff between horizontal and vertical transmission comes from studies of the filamentous bacteriophage f1. This phage establishes persistent infections of Escherichia coli cells where progeny are extruded from infected cells. Host cells suffer reduced growth, but are not killed, thus phage can also reproduce via vertical transmission. Messenger et al. experimentally manipulated the rates of horizontal and vertical transmission [37] . In the vertical transmission treatment, secreted phages were prevented from infecting new hosts. In the horizontal treatment, persistently infected cells were removed from lysates containing secreted phage. Following 24 days of With regard to emerging human viruses, no studies have quantitatively explored the fitness effects of mutations resulting in host range expansion. Because of their tractability, phage studies have contributed significantly in this regard and have shown that fitness consequences of host range expansion mutations can be broad [25, 38] . In human viruses, some circumstantial evidence points to frequent mismatches between virus growth and transmission. An anecdotal view seems to point to EVs frequently showing excessive virulence. For example, Ebola virus has been relatively unsuccessful perhaps because of its excessive virulence [39] . Other emerging pathogens, such as those causing avian influenza and SARS, were also highly lethal, and perhaps for this reason, did not spread widely. Perhaps intuitively this makes sense because the new hosts are not yet adapted to the emerging pathogen, but this argument cuts both ways. Pathogens are not yet evolved to new hosts. Moreover, this view is obviously skewed in that relatively benign EVs might not have achieved high visibility precisely because of their lack of virulence. Interestingly, studies show that most host range mutations in phages reduce virus growth rates [25, 40] . The usual supposition is that virulence and lytic phage growth are directly correlated, although this might not be strictly true for other organisms [41] . Nevertheless, we can speculate that the inability of a virus to productively replicate in a new host might reduce its ability to reduce the fitness of a host. As such, we might expect that the majority of EVs could actually be relatively non-virulent. This conjecture is supported by mathematical modeling suggesting that less virulent pathogens are more likely to emerge [8] . Without further research, however, we cannot do more than speculate about the average virulence of EVs and their propensities to fully emerge.",

In fact, circumstantial evidence suggests that the basic reproductive rate, R 0 is <1 for most EVs (Box 1) [47, 48] . This relative lack of local adaptation, and other factors such as demographic stochasticity, mutation accumulation and competition, might make it difficult for EVs to spread widely beyond their initial appearance. Thus, most emergence events probably are temporally transient [5] . An important consideration is that, because of fitness tradeoffs, most EVs are poorly adapted to novel hosts relative to native hosts.

This question is addressed in studies of phage T7 infecting E. coli where Heineman et al. apply optimal foraging theory to phage host range evolution [58] . Their results showed that T7 rapidly evolved to discriminate among different E. coli strains when one host strain was engineered to kill infecting phages but the other remained productive. In further experiments, the T7 study showed that host ratio and quality were important factors in determining whether host specialization was favored among phages.

Guyader and Burch confirm the predictions of their model using phages FX174 and G4, a generalist and a specialist, respectively. When the density of E. coli C and Salmonella typhimurium was high, the specialist G4 (infecting only E. coli C) was selectively favored.

Some viruses can undergo an additional process termed reassortment owing to the segmented nature of their genomes. In reassortment, hybrid progeny are created when two or more viruses infect the same cell. In the cell, replicated segments are packaged into capsids regardless of the parent of origin, thus progeny can contain segments from both parents (Figure 1 ).

The longer r<0 (Box 1), the greater the probability of extinction. However, there is some evidence of increased numbers of mutations of large effect when fitness is low [72] . The consequence of large effect beneficial mutations is that they might have multiple pleiotropic effects across the phenotype of an organism, which means it might be hard to predict precisely how EVs will differ from their ancestral progenitors. Virus fitness can also vary with host condition. If host immune systems are compromised in some way, then the initial r of the pathogen is higher, so initial adaptation might be quicker, and also the descendent emergent strain might be more similar overall in its properties to the ancestral strain.",

Moreover, within-and between-host viral dynamics also requires a spatial perspective and lends itself theoretically to metapopulation approaches. Phage research has significantly contributed to our understanding of the spatial dimensions of viral dynamics on several fronts. One approach seeks to understand virus infection of a tissue by modeling phage spread on a two-dimensional bacterial lawn [77] [78] [79] . The models emphasize the tradeoff between phage latent period and burst size, suggesting that these parameters are optimized based on resource availability.

Spatially restricted migration led to the evolution of reproductive ''restraint'', whereas unrestricted migration selected for ''rapacious'' phage. In the latter treatment, phage that excessively exploited their habitat fell prey to the ''tragedy of the commons'' by eliminating their resource (i.e. lysing bacteria before they had opportunity to reproduce), thus slower phage growth was selected for. By contrast, the former treatment reduced the chance of population extinction by providing phage greater opportunity for fresh resources. These results are generally supported by theory suggesting that increased population viscosity favors cooperation [81] .",

In other words, the approach taken here is ''necessary, but not sufficient'' for a broad understanding of the evolution of disease emergence. Phage/bacteria systems are limited in their ability to capture the complexities of within-host growth typical of metazoan systems. Specifically, the interplay between various metazoan cell types and tissues and metazoan viruses cannot be captured in prokaryotic systems. Coevolution concomitant with viral within-host population dynamics and host immune response are important in humans for instance, but can be more safely ignored in bacteria because of the ability to store bacteria in frozen stasis. Such coevolutionary processes could provide important constraints to virus evolutionary ecology, impacting their between-host dynamics. Another important limitation is that it is difficult to precisely simulate with bacteria the degrees of mixing that occur between different host species of metazoan viruses. For instance, avian influenza could result from very limited contact between avian and human species such that a single or few human hosts (super spreaders) can have a disproportionate influence on viral emergence [84] . Bacterial populations in laboratory settings, by contrast, are relatively homogeneous.",

Population characteristics, such as host density, host frequency, contact rate, spatial/temporal heterogeneity and community structure, should figure prominently in the persistence or extinction of new virus genotypes. These parameters are much more amenable to manipulation in bacteriophage systems. The hope is that bacteriophage research can identify important themes and parameters for viral persistence and identify areas worthy of significant effort for more sophisticated model systems. This effort is not without additional benefit. Bacteria are also a major source of infectious disease. Most studies overlook the impact of bacteriophages on bacterial population and evolutionary dynamics. Ongoing evolutionary dynamics among bacterial strains and their phages could be an important 'hidden player' in many infectious disease systems that are as yet poorly understood.",
