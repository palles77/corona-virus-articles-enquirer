Objectives: To evaluate the performance of the PLEX-ID flu detection TM kit for detecting Influenza viruses by comparison with the multiplex RespiFinder \u00ae Kit (PathoFinder). Study design: Acute-phase respiratory samples (n = 293) were analysed for this purpose. A subpopulation of influenza type A positive samples, identified with the RespiFinder \u00ae kit (n = 64), were subtyped with the RealTime ready Inf A/H1N1 Detection Set \u00ae (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) and results were compared to the PLEX-ID Flu Detection TM kit. Results: 274 samples gave concordant results (93.5%, p < 0.0001): 65 influenza A-positive, 18 influenza B-positive and 191 negative samples. Of these, 7 samples were PLEX-ID positive/RespiFinder \u00ae negative (5 influenza A and 2 influenza B) and 12 were PLEX-ID positive/RespiFinder \u00ae negative (10 influenza A and 2 influenza B). PLEX-ID showed one sample as an influenza A and B co-infection while the RespiFinder \u00ae assay showed it to be influenza A-positive. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the PLEX-ID TM system were 87.4%, 96.5%, 92.2% and 94.1% respectively. Thirteen of 19 discordant samples available for retesting were investigated further with the Anyplex TM II RV16 Detection kit (Seegene): seven were RespiFinder \u00ae concordant, while six were PLEX-ID TM concordant. Subtyping of 61/64 influenza A samples was concordant (95.3%): 55 were H1N1pdm09 and six were non-H1N1pdm09. Three samples gave negative PLEX-ID TM results (one H1N1pdm09 and two non-H1N1pdm09). Conclusions: PCR/ESI-TOF-MS technology showed good diagnostic performances to detect and subtype influenza viruses.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are responsible for winter epidemics among children and adults, with huge potential costs for society. 1 Influenza viruses are detected directly from respiratory samples. 2 That was originally done using cell cultures or direct antigen detection 3 but culture-based methods are time-consuming and direct antigen detection is not sensitive enough to provide a reliable diagnosis. Molecular diagnostics, which is globally the current standard technology, overcomes these limitations. 4 The majority of molecular approaches to influenza viruses detection are based upon real-time reverse-transcription PCR targeting the segment encoding the conserved matrix protein (M) gene segment. 5 Downstream assays can be used to type influenza A or B or further subtype influenza A. Some influenza A subtypes (H1N1pdm09, non-H1N1pdm09, H3N2, avian H5N1) can be detected using current molecular techniques that target hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). 6 However, it is still difficult to detect and identify emerging viruses with reassorted internal genes.",

A total of 274 samples gave concordant results (93.5% -p < 0.0001): 65 were influenza A positive and 18 were influenza B positive; 191 samples were negative by both techniques. One sample which was RespiFinder \u00ae Flu A positive showed a influenza A and B coinfection on the PLEX-ID TM . The sensitivity was 87.4% (95%CI: 85.2-89.6)% and the specificity was 96.5% (95%CI: 93.9-99.1)%. The positive and negative predictive values were 92.2% and 94.1% respectively.",

The PLEX-ID TM system also detected both influenza A and B types in a single sample, which could not be done with the reference technique. The possibility of coinfection has also been demonstrated by testing 145 samples with another technique (Influenza A/B r-gene TM -ARGENE-bioM\u00e9rieux-Verniolle-France). Thirty-eight samples were positive for influenza A or B and one sample tested positive for influenza A & B (data not shown).",
