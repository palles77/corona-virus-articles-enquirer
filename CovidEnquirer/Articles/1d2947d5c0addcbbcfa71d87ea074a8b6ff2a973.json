Disease modelers have historically placed much more emphasis on strength, in part because the effectiveness of an intervention strategy is typically evaluated on this scale. Here, we develop a mathematical framework for this classic, strength-based paradigm and show that there is a corresponding speed-based paradigm which can provide complementary insights. In particular, we note that r = 0 is a threshold for disease spread, just like R = 1, and show that we can measure the speed and strength of an intervention on the same scale as the speed and strength of an epidemic, respectively. We argue that, just as the strength-based paradigm provides the clearest insight into certain questions, the speed-based paradigm provides the clearest view in other cases. As an example, we show that evaluating the prospects of \"test-and-treat\" interventions against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be done more clearly on the speed than strength scale, given uncertainty in the proportion of HIV spread that happens early in the course of infection. We suggest that disease modelers should avoid over-emphasizing the reproductive number at the expense of the exponential growth rate, but instead look at these as complementary measures.",

The insight that a case must on average cause at least one new case under good conditions for a disease to persist goes back > 100 years (Ross, 1911) ; the idea of averaging by defining a 'typical' case was formalized 30 years ago (Diekmann et al., 1990) . R is also of interest because it provides a prima facie prediction about the total size of an epidemic (Anderson and May, 1991; Ma and Earn, 2006; Arino et al., 2007; Andreasen, 2011; Miller, 2012) .",

We first generalize the idea that R measures the difficulty of elimination by showing we can measure an intervention's \"strength\" on the same scale as the reproductive number. We then show that we can likewise measure an intervention's \"speed\", and that there is a duality between the threshold R = 1 and a corresponding minimal intervention strength required for elimination, and the threshold r = 0 and a corresponding minimal intervention speed. We argue that the historical primacy of R over r is partly artificial, and discuss cases where strength provides the better framing for practical disease questions and cases where speed does.",

In general, K(\u03c4, t) will depend on population characteristics that may change through time t -notably, the proportion of the population susceptible, S(t). Since we are interested in invasion and control, we will generally neglect changes in K(\u03c4, t) through time. Thus, we will assume K(\u03c4, t) \u2261 K(\u03c4 ).

A constant-strength intervention reduces the density by a constant proportion:K(\u03c4 ) = K(\u03c4 )/\u03b8; when the strength of intervention matches the strength of epidemic (\u03b8 = R), the resulting distribution is equivalent to the intrinsic generation-interval distribution (K(\u03c4 ) = g(\u03c4 )).

First, we consider a condom intervention that reduces HIV transmission by approximately 75% at the population level. Assuming that condoms act as a physical barrier, and that condom use will, on average, remain roughly constant through time, it is reasonable to model the proportional reduction in transmission due to condom use as constant across the course of infection: L condom = 1/(1 \u2212 0.75) = 4 (Fig. 3A) . The estimated strength of such an intervention is simply the average of L condom , i.e., \u03b8 = 4, whereas the estimated strength of the epidemic decreases as the proportion of early transmission increases (Fig. 3B) . Thus, the predicted effectiveness of the condom intervention will depend strongly on our estimate of the importance of early transmission: if early transmission is low, we expect disease spread to be too strong to be controlled completely by our intervention.",

The estimated epidemic speed depends only on the observed growth rate -it does not change if we change our assumption about the proportion of early transmission. For the test-and-treat intervention, the effective epidemic speed also stays relatively constant (Fig. 4D) , in part because we have (plausibly) assumed that hazard stays relatively constant for a few key months, and in part because the backward generation-interval distributions for different scenarios are relatively similar. The intervention speed increases slightly as proportion of early transmission increases because the subpopulation that the intervention fails to reach become relatively more important if late transmission is more important. Thus, the speed paradigm provides an intuitive underpinning for the originally surprising result of Eaton and Hallett (2014) : the effectiveness of test-and-treat interventions should not depend much on the proportion of early transmission. 7 .

We thus showed that the standard paradigm for R and control has a natural parallel interpretation in terms of r.",

In particular, we provided an alternative explanation for the result of Eaton and Hallett (2014) who used detailed mathematical modeling of HIV transmission to show that the amount of early transmission does not affect the effectiveness of the ART: we can control an outbreak if we can identify infected individuals and enroll them on ART faster than the observed rate at which new cases are generated, which does not depend on the estimates of the amount of early transmission. The original explanation of the result relied on a strength-based argument: increasing the amount of early transmission decreases the basic reproductive number, which negatively correlates with the outcome of the ART intervention (Eaton and Hallett, 2014) .",

For example, we expect the speed-based framework to be clearer for characterizing newly invading pathogens: when an epidemic is growing exponentially, the reproductive number cannot be estimated with confidence (Weitz and Dushoff, 2015) , especially when there is large uncertainty in the shape of the generation-interval distribution (Park et al., 2020) . Conversely, we expect the strength-based framework to be clearer for evaluating established pathogens (based on the effective proportion of the population susceptible). For interventions, we expect the speed-based framework to be clearer for evaluating intervention strategies that work at the individual level, like test-and-treat for HIV (Granich et al., 2009) , or contact-tracing and quarantine for COVID-19 (Hellewell et al., 2020) ; we expect the strength-based framework to be clearer for intervention strategies that seek to reduce the overall transmission at the population level, like condom use. In other cases, such as real-time rollout of vaccines during an outbreak, both speed and strength approaches might be similarly uncertain because the result depends both on the speed of the rollout and the (strength-like) final coverage (Shah et al., 2018) .",

In our HIV example, both the HIV epidemic and the test-and-treat intervention can be best characterized using speed.
