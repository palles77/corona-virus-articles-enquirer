There are only a few studies on molecular epidemiology of BCoV.

Japanese isolates collected after 2005 were included in antigenic Group 4. 11 In another study from South America, the Brazilian BCoV isolates were genetically divided into 2 groups. 12 At present, there are no large-scale studies that have compared the BCoV isolates from America and other parts of the world.",

            "text": "Bovine coronavirus is widespread in the cattle population, resulting in economic losses to the beef and dairy industry throughout the world. The virus has been detected on all continents and there is serologic incidence (>90%) that suggests most cattle become exposed to BCoV in their lifetime. In a recent study, the presence of BCoV in lungs was second in incidence after bovine herpesvirus. 15 Both in beef and dairy herds, BCoV can be associated with calf diarrhea, calf respiratory disease, winter dysentery, respiratory disease in adult cattle, and combined pneumonia and diarrhea in calves and adults. 16, 17 The coronavirus strains isolated from nasal secretions and lung tissues of cattle with fatal cases of pneumonia have been classified as bovine respiratory coronaviruses (BRCoV). The coronavirus strains isolated from neonatal calves and adult cattle with diarrhea are referred to as bovine enteric or enteropathogenic coronaviruses (BECoV). 18 Furthermore, for clinical purposes, BECoV can be further subdivided into BCoV-induced calf diarrhea (BCoV-CD) and winter dysentery (BCoV-WD). The clinical manifestation of the disease syndromes are not solely related to the virus itself but also to host and environmental factors; for example, the immunologic status of the animal, environmental temperature, and secondary coinfections with other pathogens. 19 Researchers have debated over last several years whether BCoV isolated from the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts of affected cattle are the same virus or are dissimilar, perhaps altered in biologic, antigenic, and genetic (sequence) properties. Several publications have supported the hypothesis that enteric and respiratory BCoV may be the same virus detected at different stages of its infectious life cycle. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] Early reports 28, 29 suggested antigenic and genomic similarity between isolates of BCoV from the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle. Later studies 5, 25, 30, 31 identified differences in antigenic, genomic, and culture characteristics between the 2 groups of BCoV isolates. At present, it is still unclear whether isolates of BRCoV and BECoV can be distinguished antigenically. 30, 32 Specific factors associated with their respective tropism for the respiratory or digestive tracts are also undefined. The reasons for scientific uncertainties 33 include that BCoV RNA genome is the longest (approximately 32,000 bases) compared with other animal viruses and is capable of further evolution. In addition, the number of complete sequences published on this virus is scarce, for example, 4 isolates comprising Mebus (U00735), Qu ebec (AF220295), and Louisiana (NC_003045) enteric and respiratory BCoV. Due to the insufficient number of BCoV isolates sequenced, an accurate comparison of BECoV and BRCoV origin is therefore difficult to establish. Moreover, there are temporal changes and geographic differences that further confound the conclusions. 34 Coronaviruses within the antigenic group 2 are known to cross between species. Beyond cattle, other domestic animals (horses, water buffalo, 35 camel, 36 New World camelids 37 ), and wildlife (deer, elk 38 ) and zoo animals (giraffe 39 ) also have BCoV-like viruses that can infect calves because these viruses are genetically related to BCoV. The infection of small ruminants with coronavirus is less common. There is seasonal variation in the incidence of BCoV diarrhea. Stressors, including inclement weather 40 and shipping, are important contributing factors that may exacerbate disease from BCoV and BRCoV infections.",

            "text": "Infection is primarily via feco-oral and to a lesser extent, respiratory (aerosol) routes. 20, 23, [41] [42] [43] Bovine enteropathogenic coronavirus is shed in mucosal secretions from the upper respiratory tract and excretions from the gastrointestinal tract. [43] [44] [45] Bovine coronavirus is ubiquitous in the cattle population and persists in adults as subclinical infections. 44, 46 However, under stressful conditions adult cattle can shed BCoV in feces and nasal secretions. 46 Most often, transmission of BECoV is horizontal, and occurs from carrier dam to offspring postpartum 47 or from clinically or chronically infected calves housed in proximity to na\u00efve ones. Evidence of vertical transmission has not been reported. 47 In close herds, respiratory tract infections constitute a source of BCoV transmission to cows or young calves. 26 Experimental inoculation of BCoV-CD and BCoV-WD strains of BCoV in adult dairy cows has been associated with development of clinical signs and viral shedding in the feces. 48 Bovine coronavirus is a pneumoenteric virus that replicates in the enterocytes of the intestinal tract and the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract. 34, 43 More specifically, the virus has been shown to replicate in the respiratory tract of calves, with viral antigen detected in the epithelium of the lung, trachea, and nasal turbinates. 7, 23 Park and colleagues 34 have suggested that BCoV infections of the respiratory tract may occur via inhalation, via monocyte-associated viremia that may originate from the intestines after ingestion of BCoV, or via cell-free viremia. In one study, peak of BCoV shedding in nasal secretions occurred at 3 days before arrival and in feces, at 3 days following entry to feedlot, under field conditions. 20 Researchers have proposed that replication and shedding of BCoV in nasal secretions is first initiated through the respiratory tract (oropharynx) then spreads to the gastrointestinal tract through the swallowing of large quantities of virus with subsequent shedding in the feces. 20, 49 Other reports have documented BCoV shedding in both nasal passages and feces within the same animal concurrently. [20] [21] [22] Respiratory disease can be consistently reproduced experimentally in young calves using a pneumoenteric BCoV, Minnesota-1988 (MN-1988 . 50, 51 Coronavirus is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, and is not as stable in the environment as rotavirus. 47 However, in the presence of organic material, these viruses may remain infectious for up to 3 days. Of note, coronaviruses can bind extremely well to clay, clay minerals, and charcoal in vitro, with an adsorption of 99%. 52 These findings suggest that clay soils can concentrate BCoV on its surface, which can be clinically relevant, as the animals grazing on these types of soils could get exposed to infectious doses of BCoV.",

            "text": "Within the last 2 decades, BRCoV has been associated, either alone or along with other respiratory pathogens, with the emergence of shipping fever pneumonia of beef cattle after transport to feedlot 5 and enzootic calf pneumonia. [55] [56] [57] However, there is still conflicting information in the literature regarding the true role of BCoV as a pathogen of the respiratory tract in calves 7,58 and feedlot cattle. Several investigators have shown that BCoV may represent one important pathogen involved in the development of BRDC, 1, [4] [5] [6] 8, 9, 59, 60 whereas others could not detect any correlation between BCoV shedding and respiratory tract disease under field conditions. 21, 32, 61 At least 3 studies failed to reproduce clinical signs of BRDC in calves after experimental inoculation with BCoV, 22, 23, 62 which may be due to choice of the viral isolate used to experimentally reproduce the infection. In contrast, 2 research groups reported that BCoV can be isolated from clinically healthy cattle, 24, 31 whereas others have failed to detect the presence of BCoV in feedlot calves experiencing respiratory tract disease. 6, 8, 59 In 1995, it was reported that all 4 of Koch's postulates to associate BCoV with upper and lower respiratory tract disease in neonatal calves were fulfilled. 45 However, these postulates do have limitations when being applied to complex diseases such as BRDC in adult cattle. 9, 63 Investigators recently supported BRCoV as the primary inciting cause of the 2 epizootics of shipping fever pneumonia they investigated, 4 based on Thomson's modification 64 of Evans' criteria of causation. 9, 65 There is evidence that BRCoV can be repeatedly isolated in the majority of calves sampled soon after feedlot entry. 32, 59, 60 Cattle shedding BCoV nasally and seroconverting within the first month after entering the feedlot are at increased risk for respiratory disease 60 and 1.6 times more likely to require subsequent treatment for BRDC. 8 Reported rates of nasal BCoV isolation in several studies have ranged from 8.1% to 60%. 8, 20, 21, 31, 60 In one report, cattle that shed BCoV in their nasal secretions during the first 28 days after feedlot arrival were 2.2 times more likely to have pulmonary lesions at slaughter compared with nonshedders. 8 Although there was no statistical association between clinical signs and virus shedding, another trial reported that feedlot cattle shedding BCoV nasally were 2.7 times more likely to show respiratory signs, and those shedding BCoV fecally were 2.5 times more likely to develop diarrhea. 32 Most of the calves shedding BCoV nasally at arrival have low but detectable antibody titers at arrival and typically seroconvert within the first 3 to 4 weeks after feedlot entry, suggesting that they are often infected with BRCoV at times when respiratory tract disease is likely to occur. 32, 59, 61 Two published seroepidemiologic studies found that although higher antibody titers against BCoV at feedlot arrival were significantly associated with a decreased subsequent risk of treatment for BRDC within cattle groups, there was no association between evidence of recent infection (titer increase) and the incidence of BRDC. 1, 61 In contrast, several investigators have shown that high antibody titers against BCoV at feedlot arrival have consistently been associated with a decrease in BCoV infection, shedding, or both, under field conditions 20, 21, 32 or in experimental challenge studies. 26, 62 Decreased BCoV shedding in nasal secretions and protection against BCoV infection have been associated with high serum antibody titers (geometric mean: GMT) ranging from 1600 to 2,262 20, 21, 26, 32 at feed yards entry. Moreover, cattle entering feedlots with high antibody titers against BCoV appeared less likely to seroconvert to BCoV than cattle without detectable BCoV titers at arrival. 1, 59, 62 Depending on the feedlot, active immunity was reported to be associated with moderate to high seroconversion (4-fold increase in BRCoV antibody titers) in the face of clinical respiratory tract infection in 58% of 814 cattle, 59 61% of 604 cattle, 1 91% of 85 cattle, 32 and 90% in 852 cattle spread among 3 different feed yards, and in 95% of 57 cattle. 21 ",

One study involving 837 calves in 4 feedlots from 2 states (Ohio, Texas) showed that the BCoV shedding or seroconversion status did not affect the average daily gain. 8 However, shedding of BCoV in feces of 6-to 7-month-old cross-bred feedlot steers was associated with a reduced weight gain of 8.17 kg (17.9 lb) during a period of 21 days. 21 In an Ohio feedlot, 32 calves that seroconverted to BCoV gained 5.9 kg (13 lb) (26%) less than the nonseroconverted group during the first 21 days after arrival to the feedlot. Seroconversion to BCoV was almost associated significantly (P<.06) with reduction in weight gain but not with clinical signs. In one report involving 203 feedlot calves from New Mexico and Arkansas, animals shedding BCoV in nasal secretions, feces, or both, gained on average 8 kg (17.64 lb) less than calves that were not shedding the virus over a 35-day period following entry. 20 Therefore, BCoV infections may contribute directly to economic losses in feedlot cattle by impacting weight gains or, similar to other respiratory viruses, by predisposing cattle to secondary bacterial infection.",

Affected animals may develop fever, 23 serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge, 66 coughing, tachypnea, and dyspnea. 5, 7 Respiratory illness caused by BRCoV in an Ohio feedlot was characterized by coughing and nasal discharge along with diarrhea, and was observed in 62% and 77% of cattle. 32 Diagnostic investigation of 214 BRDC outbreaks in Italy was associated with an 85% morbidity rate in those due to BRCoV infection. 67 The mortality rate due to BCoV infection can be high. 4, 67 In another study, 2 viral respiratory disease was seen in 19% of the animals and accounted for 20% of the mortality in feedlot cattle. Bovine respiratory coronavirus was detected in approximately 2% of the cases based on virus isolation in cell culture. If fluorescent antibody testing or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used for detection of BRCoV, the actual incidence may have been higher. The reason RT-PCR gives higher estimates of BCoV infection in lungs is because, at core body temperature, the replication of BCoV may be diminished. However, in the upper cooler parts of the respiratory tract, replication of the virus is abundant and can become the source of the virus for the lower respiratory tract.",

            "text": "Enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus is widely recognized as an important primary pathogen causing neonatal calf diarrhea (BCoV-CD). 68, 69 The pathology of BCoV-CD is often more severe than that of rotavirus, resulting in a mucohemorrhagic enterocolitis. 70 Infection leads to destruction of the absorptive intestinal villous epithelial cells. 69, 71, 72 Virus replication is cytocidal and initially occurs throughout the length of the villi in all levels of the small intestine, eventually spreading throughout the large intestine up to the end of the large colon and rectum, causing a malabsorptive diarrhea. Large concentration of BCoV can be typically found in the spiral colon. Infected epithelial cells die, slough off, and are replaced by immature cells. Stunting and fusion of adjacent villi and atrophy of colonic ridges may be seen on microscopic examination of BCoV-infected small and large intestine, respectively. 69, 71, [73] [74] [75] In case of malabsorptive diarrhea caused by BCoV, the fluid load in the gut lumen can be further exacerbated by the compensatory hyperplasia and secretions from the crypt epithelial cells. 76 The absorptive and digestive capacity of the intestinal tract is therefore compromised by loss of surface area and presence of immature cells, which are unable to secrete the normal digestive enzymes. [76] [77] [78] Lesions and consequences are most severe in younger animals. 47 Continual enteral feeding may result in more nutrients presented to the small intestine than the damaged villi can absorb. 79 Undigested nutrients are fermented in the large intestine, promoting bacterial overgrowth and production of organic acids, especially D-lactate. 80 The osmotic effects of the unabsorbed nutrients draw water into the gut lumen and contribute to the diarrhea. 76 Over time, if fluid losses exceed intake, extensive water (mainly from the extracellular space), sodium, chloride, potassium, and bicarbonate loss occurs. 81 Dehydration and metabolic acidosis subsequently develops. The acidosis has several causes including fecal bicarbonate loss, endogenous L-lactic acid production in response to dehydration and poor tissue perfusion, and local D-lactic acid production within the gastrointestinal tract. 80, 81 Epidemiology Bovine coronavirus causes enteritis in both dairy and beef herds, with naturally occurring cases showing clinical signs of disease between 5 and 30 days of life. [82] [83] [84] [85] According to the BCoV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) database from Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, 1 in 3 case of calf diarrhea in the age group of 1 to 9 weeks can be due to BCoV. Clinical disease may occur as young as 24 hours of age in colostrum-deprived calves, and as late as 5 months of age. 42, 73, 85, 86 The incidence of BCoV-CD in naturally occurring outbreaks has been reported to vary from 15% to 70%. 73, 87, 88 Once infected, a calf can excrete high levels of virus (eg, 1 billion virus particles per ml of feces) within 48 hours after experimental infection, and this may persist up to 14 days. 50 Clinically recovered calves may continue to shed low levels of virus for weeks. 50 Of note, BECoV may be detected in the feces of both diarrheic and healthy calves, with clinically diarrheic calves more commonly tested positive (incidence: 8%-69%) compared with healthy calves (incidence: 0%-24%). 73, 76, 82, 85, 88, 89 BECoV has been detected intermittently at very low levels in the feces of more than 70% of clinically normal cows, despite the presence of specific antibodies in serum and feces. 46, 87 In one study involving 132 cows and heifers with no previous BCoV vaccination history, all were found to have substantial levels of antibodies. 90 In nonvaccinated cows, the rate of virus excretion has been reported to increase by 50% to 60% during the winter months, by 65% at parturition, and by 71% 2 weeks postpartum. 44 This virus is more stable in the colder climates, due to lower ambient temperature and reduced ultraviolet light levels, 47 and has been reported to cause winter dysentery in adult cattle 91 especially after snow storms or sudden changes in ambient temperatures. Calves born to BCoV carrier dams have a significantly higher risk of developing BCoV diarrhea 92 due to periparturient exposure from fecal contamination of the perineum, teats, and the calving area.",

Epithelial cells of colonic crypts are destroyed by viral action, leading to degeneration, necrosis of crypt epithelium, and petechial hemorrhage, without involvement of the Peyer patches.

Only seldom have reports described BCoV-WD occurring during the warmer season. 34, 40, 108 The disease is characterized by a high morbidity rate ranging from 50% to 100%. 63, 91 In contrast, mortality rate is usually low, typically less than 2%, with only a few reports describing case fatality associated with this virus. 91, 99, 107 Winter dysentery outbreaks are predominantly seen in young postpartum adult dairy cows, which then experience a marked drop in milk production, resulting in 25% to 95% milk losses. 66, 100, 104, [109] [110] [111] In the acute stage of the disease, this may last 3 to 6 days.

In small housed herds, the incidence of diarrhea during an outbreak begins with the explosive appearance of signs in 10% to 15% of animals on the first day. 113 By the second day, another 20% to 40% are affected; morbidity reaches 100% by the fourth day. 104 By the end of the week the first affected animals are completely recovered, and only a small number of new cases occur. 113 Within 2 to 3 weeks of the onset of diarrhea, all animals have recovered. In large herds the outbreak may be prolonged for 6 to 8 weeks. 63 This scenario is typical of a herd that had not experienced an epizootic of winter dysentery during the preceding few years.",

Suggested antemortem samples for BRCoV infection in calves and adult cattle include nasal swabs submitted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) or normal saline in red-top tubes. Oropharyngeal fluid collected with a probang cup can be used to diagnose BRCoV in adult cattle. Trachea (upper one-third), and lungs can be collected at necropsy. However, the distribution of BCoV in the lungs is focal and thus, it is critical that multiple pieces are submitted for virus detection. Viral antigen has been detected in the apical and middle lung lobes of calves infected experimentally with BCoV (MN-1998) whereby 5% to 10% of the macrophages were positive for BCoV ( Fig. 1 ) (Tawfik Aboellail, and Sanjay Kapil, unpublished data, 2000) . Other suitable respiratory tissues include nasal turbinates, but these may be difficult to sample. Nasal turbinates and nasal glands have been found to be strongly positive for BCoV antigen using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence (Figs. 2 and 3) . 117 Spiral colon is the sample of choice for detection of BECoV at necropsy because the virus persists in that specific location for the longest time after oral infection. 50 A fresh fecal sample collected directly from the rectum can be also included, as cattle with respiratory disease commonly shed the virus in the feces concomitantly. Approximately 2 to 5 g of fresh feces can be sent to the laboratory in wide-mouth jars. It is important to submit all tissue and fecal samples over icepacks using overnight delivery to increase the likelihood of BCoV detection.",

Another useful diagnostic reagent is 8F2 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), which binds to nucleocapsid protein of BCoV, the most predominant protein of the virus (www.ruraltechinc.com). 119 The 8F2 reacts with the viral antigen in formalin-fixed intestines (see Fig. 3 ) and lungs. The 8F2 MoAb reacts with a conserved epitope of the antigenic group 2 coronaviruses such as alpaca, equine, camel, and elk coronavirus. Other laboratory-based methods for detection of BCoV include hemagglutination assay using mouse erythrocytes; this method, with modification (such as slide agglutination test), can be used in developing countries and for animal-side testing. RT-PCR assays can be used for sensitive detection of BCoV in clinical samples. The targets are the conserved nucleocapsid gene for detection of the virus and spike gene for epidemiologic investigation and strain differentiation. At present, there is no commercial test available for BCoV antigen detection in the United States. However, lateral flow immunoassays (LFT) are useful cow and calf-side tests, and are available in European Union for BCoV antigen detection in the feces. 120 Based on experimental infection with a pneumoenteric isolate of BRCoV, neonatal colostrum-deprived calves develop interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 4) and emphysema, pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage (Fig. 5) , and edema of the interlobular septa, with the ventrolateral areas of the lungs being mainly affected. 45 Most of these calves showed cryptitis in the spiral colon on histologic examination (Fig. 6) .

Approved in the European Union for use in food animals, a single injection of the long-acting NSAID meloxicam (Metacam) administered as an adjunct therapy for BRDC in feedlot cattle resulted in substantial pharmacoeconomic benefit. 122 Based on a limited number of publications 123, 124 and due to its impairment of immune function, it is usually not recommended to use corticosteroids as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of undifferentiated pneumonia in feedlot cattle. Other ancillary therapies suggested for treatment of BRDC have included Vitamin C or B injection, bovine respiratory vaccine (IBR, BVDV, BRSV, PI-3) at the time of BRDC therapy, antihistamines, anthelmintics (eg, levamisole), probiotics, and oral electrolytes; however, no published data are available to support their use. 123, 124 Supportive therapy represents an important component of BRDC treatment, and is aimed at relieving stress and allowing time for the sick animal to foster its own resistance. 55 All sick cattle should be provided shelter to avoid adverse weather conditions and not be crowded while isolated in designated hospital pens.

Protection relies on continual presence of a protective antibody within the gut lumen, which is passively acquired from the dam in the form of specific neutralizing antibodies (predominantly immunoglobulin type 1 [IgG1]) ingested in the colostrum or milk. 78, 90 This IgG isotype has activity against the spike protein of BCoV.",

However, when colostral antibody wanes, calves become susceptible to BCoV infections, especially the ones born to primiparous cows. 46 In problem herds, the immune status of susceptible calves may be raised either via vaccination of pregnant cows to increase the level of passively acquired immunity, or via oral vaccination of newborn calves to stimulate active immunity. 78 Oral administration of spray-dried bovine serum supplemented calf milk replacer (from Land-O-Lakes, Kansas City, MO) has been associated with a decrease in the severity of the clinical signs in calves experimentally inoculated with BCoV (Sanjay Kapil, unpublished data, 1999) . 127 This protection may vary and is dependent largely on the total amount of antibody titer against BCoV present.",

Protection of the respiratory tract from BRCoV has not been well studied except for one trial 60 in which extralabel use of the modified-live coronavirus and rotavirus vaccine in feedlot calves administered intranasally significantly decreased the subsequent rate of treatment for respiratory disease in cattle that had relatively low serum antibody titers against BCoV at arrival. 60 More specifically, there was an overall reduction of 26% among vaccinated calves treated for BRDC on entry to the feedlot. Furthermore, BCoV vaccinated calves with detectable intranasal BCoV had a 36% reduction in treatment for BRDC, and those with low antibody titers at arrival had 42% reduction, compared with unvaccinated calves. Although the 26% and 36% reduction was not statistically significant, it was considered clinically significant. The association between antibody titers against BCoV at feedlot arrival seems to correlate with protection from respiratory tract infection, and may promote higher weight gains 1 and reduce virus shedding in nasal secretions. 138 In one study, feedlot cattle that had BCoV antibody titers of greater than 1600 did not shed BCoV fecally or nasally. 32 In the future, BCoV vaccines may be needed to decrease the economic losses due to BCoV infection in feedlot cattle. It has been suggested recently that feedlot calves should be vaccinated against BCoV at least 3 weeks before shipping to induce a serum IgG GMT of 1860 or more, to provide protection from BCoV infection and its direct or combined effects with other pathogens of BRDC. 20 Plummer and colleagues 60 suggested that development of an intranasally administered vaccine against BCoV, either by itself or combined with BHV-1, may have an added or synergistic effect in reducing incidence and subsequent treatment for BRDC in feedlot cattle.",
