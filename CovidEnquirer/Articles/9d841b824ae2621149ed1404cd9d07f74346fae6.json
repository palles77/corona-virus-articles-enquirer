            "text": "Background: Taiwan experienced one of the most serious outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. Public health nurses faced unprecedented challenges in implementing an extensive quarantine policy to prevent disease spread. Their professional confidence, however, was shattered during the SARS crisis. This paper assesses factors related to public health nurses' confidence in managing community SARS control programs. Methods: In May 2003, we sent structured questionnaires to all 361 health centers in Taiwan and asked the public health nurses responsible for epidemic control to complete. A total of 312 completed surveys were returned for a response rate of 86.4%. Descriptive methods and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: Most public health nurses (71.9%) expressed a general lack of confidence in handling the SARS epidemic. Confidence was significantly associated with perceived epidemic severity (OR, 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35-0.99), daily epidemic updates (OR, 2.26; 95% CI: 1.28-3.98), and number of cases in the community (OR, 2.21; 95% CI: 1.13-4.31). Conclusion: Nurses' individual risk perception and prompt update of epidemic information significantly affect levels of professional confidence, a key factor influencing quarantine implementation success. Strategies to promote productive interagency collaboration and advocate participatory policy making involving health workers at all levels are needed to control effectively infectious disease outbreaks.

            "text": "The global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was a prelude to other emerging infectious diseases in the 21st Century. 1 Recent outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in Asia continue to remind the world of the threat of periodic and unpredictable recurrences of pandemic contagion. 2 Since the beginning of the SARS outbreak, many scientists have worked to characterize the coronavirus, 3, 4 trace epidemic patterns, 5 and synthesize potential vaccines to prevent further outbreaks. 6, 7 However, the global experience of managing SARS has revealed that reducing contact between people by implementing quarantine measures is as important as discovering effective remedies. 8, 9 Taiwan reported 346 probable SARS cases and 73 SARS-related deaths during the outbreak in 2003, making it one of the most serious SARS epidemic areas in the world 10, 11 Figure 1 shows the chronology of the 2003 SARS epidemic in Taiwan. Facing this unprecedented outbreak, the Taiwan government began implementation of compulsory home quarantine on March 28 to stop community transmission. 12 Individuals who were suspected to have been infected with SARS were quarantined at home (or in special facilities) for 10 to 14 days. In those 4 months of the epidemic period, 131,132 individuals were quarantined in Taiwan. This includes 50,319 people who had close contact with SARS patients and 80,813 travelers who came to Taiwan from World Health Organization (WHO)-designated SARS-affected areas. 11, 13 Public health administration in Taiwan is organized at 3 levels: national, city/county, and township. Generally speaking, national health policies are often formulated in the National Department of Health (DOH) with participation of city/county health bureau officials. The health centers (or health stations, as they are called) are the local agencies situated in the townships. The major responsibility of health centers is to implement public health protocols developed at the national and city/ county levels. The directors of health centers are usually licensed physicians. Public health nurses are usually the supporting staff who carry out program assignments. The public health operation in Taiwan is managed under this clear chain of command. Under this system, Taiwan eradicated malaria infection in the 1960s, succeeded in having 82% of all married women aged 22 to 39 years practice contraception in the 1970s, and dropped 84% of hepatitis B carriers in the 1980s. Public health nurses working at the local health centers played a key role in achieving public health success in Taiwan. 14 However, the public health nurses were unprepared in 2003 at the time of the SARS crisis.",

Logistic regression also identified variables associated with public compliance of official anti-SARS measures. Variables in univariate models that exerted a significant effect were subjected to multivariate logistics to assess significance level.

            "text": "This study is the only study reporting on the assessment of frontline nurses' reactions to home quarantines implemented by most health centers in Taiwan during the 2003 SARS outbreak. Survey respondents were mainly head nurses with more than 10 years of health center experience and were very familiar with their organizations, clients, communities, and issues surrounding quarantine operations. Furthermore, because they were required to interact directly with quarantined persons, they had the best opportunity to understand the community's response to the SARS outbreak. 15 Also, because the survey was conducted just after the SARS epidemic had peaked, the related experiences were fresh in their minds, and recall bias would have been minimal. Therefore, this report can be a valuable reference for the control and management of SARS-like contagious disease outbreaks. The WHO removed Taiwan from its list of SARSinfected areas on July 5, 2003 16 ; however, even at the beginning of June, many Taiwanese, including public health officials and lay people, remained pessimistic about the success of SARS control measures. As shown in Table 1 , most public health nurses (71.9%) believed that the outbreak would not end until mid-September or even later. There was at least a 2-month difference between frontline nurses' estimates and the actual timing of the epidemic's end, indicating a low confidence level on the part of the nurses. This is serious because the pessimistic attitudes of nurses could affect the morale of quarantined subjects, people in the community, and, eventually, the success of the SARS control program. Why did public health nurses lack confidence in implementing the anti-SARS program? As shown in Table 2 , individual risk perception, working environment of the health centers, and epidemic severity in the community were contributing factors. During the SARS epidemic, the Taiwan government made efforts, via media announcements, to assure the public that the situation was under control. From May 2003, all major television channels broadcast daily the ''SARS Front-line'' program on the evening news. The premier and the commander of the Anti-SARS Task Force also repeatedly delivered public announcements that said the outbreak would soon be over. [17] [18] [19] However, these optimistic public announcements were not always trusted by frontline nurses. The daily epidemic reports received by the nurses always seemed to be outdated. As the severity of the epidemic lessened day by day, the outdated data that showed a more severe phase of epidemic were counterproductive to boosting nurses' trust in the government's optimistic announcements. It appears that providing public health nurses with rapidly updated information is of utmost importance. Results also show that risk communication at the time of infectious disease outbreak should be based on timely, rapidly updated, and evidence-based data to supplement routine government announcements.",

Results indicated that lower confidence levels were associated with fewer cases in the community (Table  2) . Without an immediate threat, health centers in counties/cities with few SARS cases might not have fully mobilized their community resources to prepare the public or their nurses for SARS prevention and control measures. Because the national media broadcasted sensationally on the severity of SARS epidemics, public health nurses without sufficient preparation and support might have been more vulnerable to rumors and speculation about negative aspects of the outbreak such as mortality rate, resulting in a loss of confidence in organized efforts to control the SARS epidemic.",

According to the aforementioned traditional chain of command in the Taiwanese public health bureaucracy, when the SARS policy was developed, standard procedures for field operations were decided by the national office. Without having policy fine-tuned with input from frontline nurses, this top-down policy could not promptly respond to local needs that changed rapidly according to the disastrous nature of SARS contingencies. It is obvious that the long-established champion of the Taiwanese public health system needs an effective feedback mechanism to renovate its response to newly emerging infectious outbreaks. A platform that encourages participatory decision making involving health professionals at all levels should be critically emphasized in developing a national policy to control SARS-like outbreaks of pandemic contagion.",

This was independent of local epidemic severity but significantly related to people's cognitive preparedness and the efficiency of interagency collaborations (Table  3) . Quarantine restricts the movement of people who can potentially expose others to a disease. 20, 21 How to implement effectively a community-wide quarantine therefore presents a major challenge to health agencies. Table 3 shows that people who were less knowledgeable about the SARS outbreak and those who expressed little fear of infection were less compliant in following anti-SARS measures. In the future, more efforts should be placed on educating people to increase their health knowledge and beliefs, especially about risk susceptibility and severity, and belief in the benefits of taking health actions. 22, 23 Moreover, effective community health education programs that emphasize community-based participatory research and education should be considered. 24, 25 From a national perspective, a comprehensive SARS control strategy should also be developed that would streamline communication and resource sharing among health agencies at all levels.",
