The NP peptides showed a high binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 on T2 cells, and were able to induce the activation of the cytotoxic T cells in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We examined the potential of using NP373 and NP458 peptide sequences supplemented with a single-chain trimer as potential DNA vaccine candidates in an HHD transgenic mouse model. A gene gun delivery system was used for administrating the vaccine candidates into the animals. The results from cytotoxicity and ELISPOT assays indicated that a significant amount of IFN-c was secreted by the T cells of the vaccinated mice, and the T cells were able to eliminate the corresponding peptide-loaded T2 cells. The discovery of these novel immunogenic NP peptides provides valuable information for avian flu vaccine design and construction.",

In the influenza A virus, NP is a comparatively conserved protein, and there is no recorded evolution in the viral strains of most birds over the past 60 years. [26] . Therefore, because of its high conservancy during the evolution of the virus, NP is an attractive target for inducing T-cell immunity [10, 26] . One of the promising approaches involves a direct DNA vaccination to stimulate T-cell immunity against NP. Some DNA vaccines and recombinant viral vaccines such as those constituting an adenovirus encoding the whole NP gene, are found effective in eliciting the T-cell immunity [6, 7, 14, 23] .",

In order to determine their binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 positive cells, the peptides were synthesized and a T2-cell binding assay was performed. T2 cells normally express unstable HLA molecules on the cell surface and therefore if a peptide is able to fit into the peptidebinding groove of an HLA molecule, it will form a more stable structural complex with the HLA molecule in the presence of b 2 -microglobulin. This complex can be detected with an anti-human HLA-A2 antibody via flow cytometry. In our assay, a flu peptide (GILGFVFTL), which is an HLA-A*0201 epitope, was used as a positive control for the experiment. The results indicate that the NP373 (AMDSNT-LEL), NP189 (MVMELIRMI), and NP458 (FQGRGVFEL) showed the highest scores in the T2-cell binding assay (Fig. 1) .",

A desirable peptide sequence for inducing cytotoxic T-cell response should be presented as an endogenous peptide epitope through proteasome digestion and have a high binding affinity towards human MHC class-I molecules. Therefore, apart from the T2-cell binding assay, the stimulating ability of the predicted peptides was also accessed via an in vitro stimulation using human PBMC. In vitro stimulation was carried out by priming the T cells with the naturally processed NP peptides from autologous DC. Our results showed that the NP189 peptide stimulated the strongest immune response amongst the four peptides used. The binding affinity of NP158 in the T2-cell binding assay was relatively high but no significant change in the immune response was observed during in vitro administration of human PBMC, and the result produced was similar to the negative control. This suggests that the peptide prediction software can only give a computational estimation of immunogenicity of potential vaccine candidates. Hence, the predicted epitopes may not truly reflect experimental conditions in vitro nor mimic the real state in vivo. Natural processing and peptide presentation on the HLA molecule significantly contribute to the magnitude of the immune response [5, 8] . In our experiment, the number of CD8+ T cells detected via intracellular cytokine staining was not as high as expected compared to the whole pool of CD8+ T cells. In normal natural processing, all epitopes on NP-loaded DC are presented to the CD8+ T cells, based on the cross-presentation characteristics of the DC [4, 16, 27] . Therefore all activated CD8+ T cells should be responsive to the immunogenic epitopes presented on NP. In our experiment, our target cells were loaded with only a single type of the target peptide which may explain why such a low percentage of cell activation caused by the corresponding peptide-specific CD8+ T cells is observed.",

With this method, peptides are able to specifically bind to the peptide-binding cleft created by the HLA-A*0201 a-1 and a-2 domains, and this phenomenon can imitate the natural binding of peptides onto the MHC class-I molecules during normal antigen processing [12] . Also the SCT system ensures the stability of the MHC I-peptide complex after translation [29] , and a more precise and direct priming of the professional antigen presenting cells to the cytotoxic T cells is achieved. Hence the stimulating efficiency of the peptide vaccine can be greatly maximized [2] .",

HHD is a special mouse type which lacks mouse b 2 -microglobulin and MHC I, but contains human b 2 -microglobulin and HLA-A*0201 a-1, a-2, as well as a mouse a-3 fusion gene. This genetically modified mouse immune system can impersonate a human system's immune response to stimulation restricted to the reaction between HLA-A*0201 and T-cell receptors only, eliminating the background caused by mouse MHC class-I molecules [21] . In our experiment, cytotoxicity and ELISPOT assays showed that the NP373-381 AMDSNT-LEL and NP458-466 FQGRGVFEL are the most immunogenic peptides. The reactivity of the two peptides was consistent with all the tests during the process of epitope identification. Another target peptide, NP189, although it showed good responses in the T2-cell binding assay and in vitro stimulation of human CD8+ T cells, it induced a weak response in animal experiments. This is another indication that the in vitro system does not reflect the in vivo situation. Nonetheless, in vitro experiments are essential for acquiring basic information to verify the characteristics of these potential peptides and discovered immunogenic peptides, since the testing of the peptides cannot be performed in clinical trials without extensive investigation. The T2-cell binding assay is a good methodology for examining the potential binding affinity of the target peptides to the groove of HLA-A*0201 molecules. The antigen processing and presentation, and the magnitude of the CD8+ T-cell responses corresponding to the stimulants can be investigated via in vitro stimulation of the CD8+ T cells. We believe that the HHD transgenic mouse model is an appropriate animal model for investigating the stimulating effects of the peptide-HLA complex to the corresponding T-cell responses.",

Our results indicate that these two epitopes are capable of inducing a strong immune response, and that the SCT system can improve the immune responses. The finding of these novel cytotoxic T-cell epitopes presented provides significant information for the development of a human H5N1 vaccine. In the future, experiments using a mixture of SCT-DNA constructs encoding H5N1 NP epitopes instead of using one type of SCT-DNA construct encoding a single peptide are necessary to investigate whether there are any improvements for the immunogenicity.",
