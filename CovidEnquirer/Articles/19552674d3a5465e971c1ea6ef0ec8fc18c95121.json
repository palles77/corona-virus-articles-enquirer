By using Carol Bacchi's what's the problem represented to be? method of discourse analysis, the objective of this paper was to identify and understand the premises and effects of the problem-solving paradigm underlying ICAO's alternative jet fuel strategy. As a result, three problem representations were identified, from which two out of four underlying assumptions have reinforced ICAO's weak sustainability approach to international aviation's growth and have led to a number of discursive, subjectification and lived effects. The selected method also allowed the authors to identify several options to disrupt those premises in favor of the implementation of more aggressive mitigation and adaptation strategies without constraining air travel demand, including: (i) raising awareness of the environmental impacts of aviation beyond the tailpipe emissions, (ii) improving the understanding of the effects of climate change on the air transport sector, and (iii) reassessing the sectoral approach to the Sustainable Development Goals so as to gain consistency with the aims of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",

Conversely, domestic and international flights currently account for \u223c2 percent of the total carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from anthropogenic origin (IATA, 2015; Penner et al., 1999) , a contribution that can be as high as 4.9 percent when the radiative forcing effect of greenhouse and nongreenhouse gas emissions at cruise altitude are accounted for (Moore et al., 2017; Novelli, 2011; Lee et al., 2009; Penner et al., 1999) .

Also, notwithstanding that it was originally designed and has been applied ever since for public policy analysis, the WPR is equally useful to analyze ICAO's alternative jet fuel strategy, where the novelty of this research paper rests.",

Sealevel rise can damage airports, increase the recurrence of runway flooding, prompt flight delays and cancellations due to extreme weather events, and increase the frequency of icing during the fall and winter (Haines, 2017; Morad, 2017; WMO, 2016; Wienert, 2010) .",

But as it has been remarked by others in the past (A39-WP/427; Palmer, 2015; Piera, 2015; Bridger, 2013) technological efficiencies introduced over the years would have taken place regardless of the sector's climate commitments and as a result of cost-reduction strategies and compliance with local regulations. SDG.12 is particularly relevant to the aviation sector because it emphasizes the need for governments, international organizations and the private sector to raise public awareness on sustainable development and to encourage the adoption of \"lifestyles [that are] in harmony with nature\" (SDG.12.8). Also, SDG.12 urges governments to adopt regulatory and policy measures to phase-out fossil-fuel subsidies so as to reduce the environmental externalities of wasteful consumption (SDG.12.8.c) (A/RES/70/1). However, there are no initiatives from ICAO, its Member States or the industry to address these targets and they are not mentioned in their official reports (ATAG, 2017; ICAO, 2016; A39-WP/374).",

(WPR) methodological framework to analyze the premises and effects of the problem-solving paradigm underlying ICAO's work on environmental protection. In consequence, some of the findings of this exploratory exercise could be equally applied to the analysis of ICAO's market-based CORSIA insofar as they both build on the same problem representations and their underlying assumptions (Q1,2). However, a separate analysis would be required for an in-depth understanding of the rationale and the material and symbolic impacts of CORSIA as an indirect carbon mitigation strategy. Three problem representations were identified in ICAO's alternative jet fuel strategy: (1) the increasing contribution of international aviation to climate change, (2) the technological limitations to constraint and reduce the necessary carbon emissions to sustain the continued sectoral expansion, and (3) the uncertainty around future jet fuel prices and availability. However, two out of the four assumptions underlying the foregoing problem representations have encouraged ICAO and the industry to historically underplay the sector's environmental impacts, leading to a number of discursive, subjectification and lived effects. The first conflicting assumption is that air transport growth is considered by ICAO and the industry as a condition sine qua non for social inclusion and economic development, while the second one is that the environmental impacts from aviation are regarded as strictly technological issues that should be addressed through technological and market-based solutions.",

Also, climate efforts could greatly benefit from incorporating aspects into the international discussions that have received little to no attention, such as: (1) raising awareness of the environmental impacts of aviation beyond the tailpipe emissions, (2) improving the understanding of current and future climate impacts on the air transport sector, and (3) reassessing the sectoral approach to the SDGs so as to gain consistency with the aims of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",

Furthermore, there are areas of scientific uncertainty about the effects of other GHGs (NO x , SO x , CH 4 , O 3 , PM and H 2 O) released at cruise altitude (8-13 km AMSL) that have limited the development of a more comprehensive approach from ICAO to GHGs mitigation (Moore et al., 2017; Novelli, 2011; Lee et al., 2009; Penner et al., 1999; Piera, 2015).",
