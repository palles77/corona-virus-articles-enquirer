Thus, it is unclear to which degree findings of \"attenuated brain aging\" in HIV 9, 11,12 may be mediated by primary or secondary processes related to the infection. It is also unclear what effects these processes may have on WM microstructure. Therefore, this study sought to expand on previous findings by investigating the predicted-BAG in WM microstructure using DTI metrics of white matter patency.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5 Kuhn, T., Ph.D. 5 Here, we used a machine learning approach to quantify brain aging based on DTI. A support vector machine model trained in a large and independent training-set of healthy controls was used to predict age in HIV+ and comparable HIV-individuals. We tested for group differences in BAG between HIV+ and HIV-, and for associations with cognitive function and HIV disease factors as well as medical comorbidities within the HIV+ group. We converted raw test scores into within-sample z scores and then averaged them to create neurocognitive domain z scores. We calculated the global neurocognition score by averaging the z scores from all of the neuropsychological test variables. Given that the relationship between age and neurocognitive performance in HIV is a primary aim of this study, within-sample z scores were computed instead of demographically-adjusted T scores. IMMUNE STATUS ASSESSMENT: In the testing dataset, HIV+ participants selfreported nadir CD4+ and lifetime highest viral load were used to assess past immune status. Participants also underwent venipuncture to test current CD4+ and HIV viral load. HIV duration was calculated as the number of years since the participant's selfreported HIV diagnosis. Next, participants were classified as either 'pre-HAART' (highly active antiretroviral therapy) or 'post-HAART' based on whether their initial HIV diagnosis was before or after 1996 24 . Further, a \"medical comorbidity burden' index score was computed from the medical history taken during the routine interview all participants completed during data collection. Participants were assigned a '1' if they endorsed a history of each of the following medical conditions: cerebrovascular risk factors including hypertension, heart failure, COPD, anemia, diabetes; endocrine dysfunction including thyroid disease, testosterone therapy, estrogen therapy; kidney disease. Participants were assigned a '0' for all medical conditions they did not endorse. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Similar methods have been employed using imaging data previously 9, 10, 32, including using DTI to assess participant age in a healthy cohort 33 . SVR was conducted in Matlab (https://mathworks.com/help/stats/fitrsvm.html) using the implementation \"fitrsvm\" with a linear kernel, automatic hyperparameter tuning and Sequential Minimal Optimization. Given that multiple MR scanners were used to collect the HIV and training data, scanner was used as a regressor on the features to control for interscanner variability. The model accuracy was validated using 10-fold cross-validation on the training set. After successful validation, the trained SVR was used to predict age of participants in the independent UCLA sample (HIV+ / HIV-).

Holt and colleagues 6 suggest two potential explanations regarding the relationship between HIV infection and increased brain aging. First, the increased brain age (BAG) may be explained by premature WM aging resulting from the virus facilitating neurodegenerative processes 35 , such as axonal injury, loss of axonal density, reduced patency of axons. Alternatively, advanced age may increase the effects of the virus on the CNS, thereby creating a synergistic interaction effect between HIV and aging 6 . Our finding that lifetime highest HIV RNA viral load, particularly in the context of advanced chronological age, was related to augmented WM aging (i.e. BAG) supports the first hypothesis. In line with this hypothesis, HIV effects on the brain have been shown to occur via similar cellular mechanisms as normal aging 36 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint volume 9 . Similar to that reported by Cole et al., we did not find significant relationships between WM BAG and Nadir CD4 or HIV duration. Our findings expand upon these previous results by providing data suggesting the mechanism through which this augmented aging process deleteriously affects WM microstructure. Our results also further the literature in that we found a significant relationship between BAG and peak HIV RNA viral load as well as a significant age*peak viral load interactive effect on BAG, indicating that the effects of disease burden on brain integrity are more pronounced with advanced age.",

The BAG findings were much stronger than our conventional age-trajectory findings, indicating that the SVRbased brain age approach we used is a sensitive approach to reveal group differences beyond simple differences in mean DTI measures. Additionally, BAG outperformed each individual DTI metric in its ability to discriminate between HIV+ and HIVparticipants and demonstrate the effect of HIV infection on advancing brain white matter age. BAG also may be more useful than, or at the very least a meaningful compliment to, hyper/hypo-intense lesion volume and count which has been shown to relate to HIV infection and cognitive performance, but not to HIV clinical variables or HIV-associated aging 41, 42, 43 . Additionally, BAG is a relatively easy metric to understand and thus it circumvents the cumbersome and difficult to interpret multivariate score often used with DTI metrics which are inherently difficult to connect to clinical variables. In contrast, BAG was successfully and clearly connected to both HIV clinical variables (e.g. HIV RNA viral load) and neurocognitive performance.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/265199 doi: bioRxiv preprint It is important to consider these findings also in the context of the psychosocial stressors and associated comorbidities associated with living with HIV. For example, the HIV+ sample evidenced greater rates of comorbidities, both medical (which were included in the model herein) and psychiatric (e.g. depression, which was not included in the model). It is unclear in the literature to what extent depression is a secondary reaction to living with HIV or is a neurologic symptom of the predominantly frontalsubcortical clinical profile of the disease. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the augmented aging findings are related directly and solely to the effects of the HIV virus on the brain or if they are also related to secondary effects of these HIV-associated increased comorbidities. This is particularly worthy of follow up investigation given that depressive disorders are the most prevalent mental health disorders associated with HIV 44 and studies have shown that depression can be associated with neurodegeneration and increased brain age 45 .",

This could be due to differences in the neuroimaging methodology used (e.g. size, variability and number of features of training sample set). However, it is also the case that we sought to test a different biological entity (DTI-based WM microstructure), and as such a direct comparison between SVR-derived brain ages may not be appropriate, as Cole et al sought to determine a best-predicted brain age based on grey/white matter volume and we sought to determine the best-predicted age of WM microstructure.. The fact that data was acquired at multiple sites using different MR scanner could be a factor and a limitation. However, scanner was included as a variable in the model and the data was homogenized using a single, uniform processing pipeline which has become an accepted standard of practice in the field and indeed has been used in similar machine learning papers 9, 10 where the training data and the disease-specific data were collected at separate sites using different scanners and non-identical scanning parameters.

Any single or combination of these mechanisms could lead to loss of WM microstructural organization through axonal injury (in line with AD contributions to SVR model), loss of axonal density (MD contributions) and/or reduced patency of axons (RD contributions).To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an HIVassociated accentuated aging process in WM microstructure, using DTI. These findings are generally consistent with the literature, including a recently published study showing an HIV-related accentuated aging process in combined grey matter/white matter",

All procedures were in accordance with relevant IRBs. PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT: In the test sample, the Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for DSM-IV 15 , and structured questionnaires were used to screen for neurological, psychiatric, and medical confounds including: history of seizure disorder or other neurologic disorder; history of concussion or traumatic brain injury sufficient to warrant medical attention; history of Axis I psychiatric disorder or current substance use disorder (SCID-IV diagnostic criteria); current prescriptions for psychotropic medication, except for anxiolytics and antidepressants; current substance dependence or stimulant use, comorbid infection (e.g. Hepatitis C), HIV-associated CNS opportunistic infection (e.g. CNS toxoplasmosis) or CNS neoplasm. Participants were also screened for contraindications to MRI. COGNITIVE ASSESSMENTS: In the test sample, participants completed a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery used in prior studies 16 , which assessed neurocognitive function at both the global and domain level. Six cognitive domains were measured: (1) Processing Speed -Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) Digit Symbol and Symbol Search subtests 17 , Trail Making Test-Part A 18 , and Stroop-Color Naming and Word Reading 19 ; (2) Learning -Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised 20 and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised 21 ; (3) Memory -Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised 20 and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised 20, 21 (delayed recall); (4) Language/Verbal Fluency -Controlled Oral Word Association Test 22 (FAS and Animals); (5) Executive Function -WAIS-IV Letter-Number Sequencing subtest 17 , Trail Making Test-Part B 18 , and Stroop-Color-Word Interference Test 19 ; and (6) Motor Speed -Grooved Pegboard test 23 (dominant and non-dominant hands).",

ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN BRAIN AGE GAP IMMUNE STATUS AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE: Within HIV+ subjects, a stepwise hierarchical linear regression was conducted to investigate the relationship between BAG and chronological age, nadir CD4+, lifetime highest HIV RNA viral load and medical comorbidity index, and all possible interactive relationships between age and other dependent variables using a stepwise entry model. Correlation analyses were used to investigate the relationship between BAG and cognitive performance in the UCLA HIV+ group. Correlations were conducted between BAG and individual cognitive domains (e.g. attention, memory) as well as global cognitive performance. We report both bivariate correlations as partial correlations covarying for premorbid intellectual ability (Wide Range Achievement Test, 4 th Edition (WRAT-4) 34 ).
