            "text": "We describe a new method for affinity purification of recombinant proteins using a dual protease protocol. Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP) is employed as an N-terminal tag to increase the yield and solubility of its fusion partners. The MBP moiety is then removed by rhinovirus 3C protease, prior to purification, to yield an N-terminally His 6 -tagged protein. Proteins that are only temporarily rendered soluble by fusing them to MBP are readily identified at this stage because they will precipitate after the MBP tag is removed by 3C protease. The remaining soluble His 6 -tagged protein, if any, is subsequently purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). Finally, the N-terminal His 6 tag is removed by His 6 -tagged tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease to yield the native recombinant protein, and the His 6 -tagged contaminants are removed by adsorption during a second round of IMAC, leaving only the untagged recombinant protein in the column effluent. The generic strategy described here saves time and effort by removing insoluble aggregates at an early stage in the process while also reducing the tendency of MBP to \"stick\" to its fusion partners during affinity purification.",

Currently, samples of proteins for structural and functional studies are routinely obtained by bioengineering [1] . Even so, protein purification remains the principal bottleneck. Conventional methods of protein purification have been almost completely supplanted by affinity-based methods that employ protein or peptide affinity tags [2e4] . The popularity of these affinity-based methods can be attributed to their generic nature in comparison with traditional approaches, which are rather protein specific. Other purification platforms such as ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and size exclusion chromatography are used as auxiliary steps to further enhance the purity of the sample if necessary.",

            "text": "In our laboratory and many others, a dual His 6 eMBP (maltosebinding protein) tag is used in an initial immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) step [5e7]. The reason for employing the dual tag has been discussed in detail elsewhere [8] . Briefly, MBP enhances the solubility and improves the yield of its fusion partners during overproduction but is not a particularly effective affinity tag for protein purification. Hence, the His 6 tag is included to allow affinity chromatography by IMAC. The N-terminal His 6 eMBP tags are subsequently removed by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease to generate a tag-free protein. Although in general this approach has been very successful, it is not without its problems. For instance, a significant fraction of aggregation-prone proteins that are rendered soluble by fusing them to MBP subsequently precipitate when the fusion proteins are cleaved by TEV protease [9, 10] . These proteins presumably either are not properly folded or exist as soluble aggregates in partially folded forms. Usually it cannot be ascertained whether or not this will be a problem until after affinity purification. A second potential pitfall is the tendency of some proteins to stick to MBP after TEV digestion, making it difficult to separate them from each other. The interaction between MBP and its fusion partners may be related to the mechanism of solubility enhancement [11] . In these situations, it is usually necessary to employ an MBPTrap (or amylose) column, or another IMAC step to remove the MBP, thereby making the purification process more labor intensive. In the current study, we attempted to circumvent both of these problems by using a dual protease approach to achieve sequential removal of the MBP and His 6 tags.",

First, a SnaBI restriction site was inserted at the end of the open reading frame (ORF) encoding MBP in pKM596 [14] using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) with primers PE-2852 and PE-2853 (Table 1) to generate the plasmid pSRK2704. In the next step, the C terminus of MBP in pSRK2704 was further extended to include an in-frame 3C protease recognition site followed by a His 6 tag by PCR restriction cloning using PE-42, PE-2886, and PE-2887 primers ( Table 1 ). The PE-42 primer was designed to anneal just proximal to the BglII site in the malE gene, whereas PE-2886 and PE-2887 were partially overlapping reverse primers that were employed to engineer the desired insertions (3C site and His 6 tag) followed by a SnaBI restriction site. The PCR amplicon, consisting of a C-terminal portion of the MBP ORF from pKM596 joined in-frame to a sequence encoding GGGLEVLFQ/ GPHHHHHHYV, was digested with BglII and SnaBI and then cloned between the same sites in pSRK2704 to yield the destination vector pSRK2721 ( Table 2 ). The \"YV\" residues shown above are cloning artifacts derived from the SnaBI site.

            "text": "A kanamycin-resistant plasmid with a p15A origin of replication and an L-arabinose-inducible promoter was created as described previously with slight variations [18] . In the initial step, the desired insertion sequence (p15A ori) was PCR-amplified using a highfidelity DNA polymerase. The forward and reverse primers for creating a \"p15A mega primer\" were pSAMRFFwd and pSAMRFRev, respectively ( Table 1) . The reaction setup, cycling method, and template DNA were the same as described previously [18] . This mega primer amplicon was used as complementary primers in a subsequent QuikChange Lightning reaction (Agilent Technologies) to bring about the desired change in the target plasmid. The QuikChange Lightning reaction mix consisted of the target DNA template (50 ng) and the mega primer amplicon (350 ng) along with other PCR components. The cycling method was as follows: 95 C for 30 s (segment 1); 95 C for 30 s, 52 C for 1 min, 68 C for 7 min (segment 2 for 5 cycles); 95 C for 30 s, 55 C for 1 min, 68 C for 7 min (segment 3 for 13 cycles). The target plasmid in the QuikChange reaction was pBLN200eGFPmut2eCar9 [13] in our reaction mix instead of pET-28a(\u00fe) in the earlier method [18] . The pBLN200eGFPmut2eCar9 is a derivative of pET-24a(\u00fe) and carries the arabinose-inducible P BAD promoter and the araC gene instead of the T7 promoter. Thus, effectively the ColE1 replicon in pBLN200eGFPmut2eCar9 was replaced with the p15A replicon. The modified vector, pSRK2738 (Table 2) , was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. Induction of the vector with L-arabinose was confirmed by monitoring the fluorescence of the GFPmut2 protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Agilent Technologies). Next, the 3C protease ORF, bracketed by NdeI and XhoI sites, was amplified by PCR, cleaved with these restriction enzymes, and inserted between the same sites in pSRK2738 to generate the L-arabinose-inducible, untagged 3C protease expression vector pSRK2751 (Table 2) .",

The purpose of the MBP tag is to enhance the solubility and promote the proper folding of the passenger protein [4, 11, 20] . The 3C protease site allows the MBP moiety to be separated from the His 6 -tagged passenger protein prior to IMAC. This has two benefits. First, it enables one to determine whether or not the passenger protein will precipitate when it is released from MBP before any chromatographic steps are performed. Second, it helps to alleviate the propensity of MBP to stick to and copurify with some passenger proteins, probably because such an interaction is less likely to persist once the two fusion partners are no longer covalently attached to one another. After IMAC purification of the His 6 -tagged passenger protein, the His 6 tag is removed by His 6 -tagged TEV protease. In the final step, the cleaved His 6 tag and the TEV protease are adsorbed by another IMAC step, leaving just the pure untagged passenger protein in the column effluent.",

In one approach, E. coli cell paste containing an overproduced fusion protein is mixed with cell paste containing 3C protease and lysed together. The 3C protease, which is highly active at low temperature [21] , will rapidly cleave the fusion protein during processing of the sample. Alternatively, 3C protease can be coexpressed with the fusion protein substrate. For this purpose, an arabinose-inducible 3C protease vector is used, enabling the production of 3C protease to be controlled independently of the IPTGinducible fusion protein expression vector.

This observation was unexpected considering the reportedly strict requirement for Gly and Pro residues in the P1 0 and P2 0 positions, respectively, of a 3C protease recognition site [26] . In a subsequent titration experiment, it was determined that an E. coli cell weight ratio of 10:1 (fusion protein cells/3C protease cells) can remove the MBP tag efficiently without causing any nonspecific cleavage at the TEV site (Fig. 3) .

First, cells expressing 3C protease are combined with cells expressing an appropriately designed MBP fusion protein ( Fig. 1A) and lysed together to cleave off the MBP tag. Second, the soluble His 6 -tagged passenger protein is purified by IMAC on a HisTrap column. Third, the affinity-purified protein is digested with His 6 -tagged TEV protease to remove the His 6 tag and the translated attB1 region, thereby generating the native protein devoid of any tags and cloning artifacts with the possible exception of an N-terminal glycine residue. Finally, the pure protein is collected in the effluent from a second HisTrap column, which serves to remove the His tag, the TEV protease, and any residual undigested His-tagged passenger protein. This second IMAC step also aids in the removal of any nonspecific proteins that appeared in the first IMAC elution. A gel filtration column is recommended as a final polishing step and a means of removing any soluble aggregates that may be present.",

            "text": "The extraordinary ability of MBP to enhance the yield and promote the solubility of its fusion partners is well documented [14, 20, 23] , but it is not a particularly good affinity tag for protein purification. Therefore, we and others have employed a generic strategy for protein expression and purification that combines the solubility-enhancing benefit conferred by MBP with the powerful advantage of immobilized metal affinity chromatography by using a polyhistidine tag in a tandem configuration with MBP (His 6 eMBP) [5e7]. Although frequently successful, this approach has two potential pitfalls. First, many aggregationprone proteins that can be rendered soluble by fusing them to MBP subsequently precipitate after they are separated from the solubility enhancer. Second, MBP has a tendency to form noncovalent complexes with some passenger proteins, which complicates their downstream purification. The first problem occurs when passenger proteins are unable to fold properly, either spontaneously or with the assistance of endogenous chaperones, once the competing kinetic pathway of aggregation is blocked by fusing them to MBP [11] . Currently, there is no generally effective solution to this problem. However, the method reported here, in which MBP is cleaved from the passenger protein in the crude cell extract, enables many of these \"dead end\" cases to be spotted very early, prior to purification of the fusion protein by affinity chromatography. Still, occasionally a passenger protein may remain soluble but be biologically inactive after it is released from MBP, possibly because fusion to MBP enables certain proteins to evolve into kinetically trapped folding intermediates that are no longer susceptible to aggregation. Therefore, it is advisable to employ a biological assay, if possible, at an early stage to confirm that the passenger protein is properly folded. The second advantage of cleaving the MBP fusion protein prior to affinity purification is that this reduces the tendency of MBP to \"stick\" to the cleaved passenger protein during its purification. This characteristic of MBP may be related to the mechanism by which it promotes solubility and inhibits aggregation, which is thought to involve the formation of transient complexes between MBP and partially folded passenger proteins [11] .",

            "text": "Although the amino acids surrounding the 3C protease cleavage site are the same in all of the fusion proteins, they were not all cleaved with equal efficiency ( Fig. 2A and B) . The most likely explanation for this is that some of the fusions exist in the form of soluble aggregates, thereby masking the cleavage site. We have also observed cases in which a His 6 eMBP fusion protein binds readily to IMAC (e.g., Ni-NTA) resin, whereas the corresponding His 6 fusion protein generated after 3C cleavage does not. This could be due to obstruction of the His 6 tag when it is present on the N terminus of the passenger protein as opposed to when it is attached to the N terminus of MBP. This is exemplified by DUSP14 (see Fig. S3A in supplementary material) . Inefficient binding of a His 6 -tagged passenger during IMAC is not necessarily indicative of an unfolded protein, however, because at least some of the unbound His 6 DUSP14 was enzymatically active (data not shown). Donnelly and coworkers have described a similar dual protease approach using tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV) and TEV proteases [27] . However, the method presented here has two noteworthy advantages. First, 3C protease is used instead of TVMV protease to separate MBP from the His-tagged passenger protein. 3C protease is superior to TVMV protease because it is highly active at low temperature [21] . Consequently, the reaction proceeds efficiently on ice. Moreover, in Donnelly and coworkers' method the fusion protein is cleaved by TVMV protease inside intact cells. Yet expression of the TVMV protease is constitutive, resulting in the rapid cleavage of MBP fusion proteins following their translation. There is significant evidence to suggest that the longer a protein remains fused to MBP, the more likely it is to fold correctly [22] . Although delayed induction of the 3C protease gene on the plasmid Fig.4 . In vivo (intracellular) processing by L-arabinose induction of 3C protease. The MBPesfGFP fusion protein was digested in vivo by coexpressing 3C protease to varying degrees as indicated. The presence (\u00fe) or absence (\u00c0) of IPTG or L-arabinose is marked. The leaky expression of 3C protease causes partial digestion of the MBPesfGFP (first lane from left). M, molecular weight markers. pSRK2751 with arabinose was intended to solve this problem, unfortunately enough protease was produced in the absence of inducer to cleave a substantial portion of a well-expressed MBPesfGFP fusion protein in vivo (Fig. 4) . Hence, we recommend employing the novel co-lysis method of 3C protease cleavage instead.",
