The lipid composition and function of such unenveloped intracellular viruses remain unknown. Detergent treatment of the intracellular viruses triggered the loss of viral lipids, capsid proteins and infectivity. Enzymatic digestion of the viral lipids with phospholipases and sphingomyelinase retained the viral capsid proteins but reduced infectivity. Over 220 lipid species were identified and quantified from the viruses and its producer cells by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Ten caspid proteins that dissociated from the viruses following the detergent treatments were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS/MS. Five of them were demonstrated to be lipid-binding proteins. This is the first research detailing the lipidome and lipid-protein interactions of an unenveloped virus. The identified lipid species and lipid-binding proteins will facilitate further studies of the viral assembly, egress and entry.",

Viruses acquire and enrich specific classes of lipids into their envelope structures to increase their infectivity (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2005; Mercer and Helenius, 2008) . Selective depletion of one lipid class from enveloped viruses can reduce viral infectivity (Goluszko and Nowicki, 2005) . On the other hand, compositional changes of cellular lipids are implicated in cell proliferation, apoptosis, stress and viral infection (Bravo et al., 2005; German et al., 2007; van Meer et al., 2008; Vukelic and Kalanj-Bognar, 2001; Wenk, 2006) . However, in comparison to many extensive studies of genomes and proteomes, lipidomic studies of viruses and their producer cells are limited and primarily focused on mammalian enveloped viruses (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2005; McSharry and Wagner, 1971; Mercer and Helenius, 2008; Schlesinger et al., 1973) .",

A combined approach of liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry was used to quantitatively analyze the lipid composition of intracellular SGIV and a grouper embryonic cell (GEC) line in which SGIV replicated. Compared with traditional TLC methods, this analytical approach provides highly selective, sensitive and quantitative determination of lipid molecules in a mixture (Guan et al., 2006; Schwudke et al., 2007) . More than 220 species of lipid molecules were measured. We found that the lipid composition of SGIV is significantly different from that of other viruses reported. In addition, ten viral capsid proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS and five of them were confirmed to be lipid-binding proteins. We demonstrated that viral lipids are important for viral integrity and infectivity.",

A high resolution picture from cryo-EM may help to reveal such membrane structure as it was observed in Chilo iridescent virus (Yan et al., 2009) . The outer layer of SGIV was much thicker than a common viral envelope which is typically of 5-8 nm thickness. In addition, there was no visible gap between the SGIV outer layer and capsid shell. These observations suggest that the outmost layer may closely interact with the capsid shell and differs significantly from the typical envelope structure of other viruses.",

After the treatment with 75% ether, the outer layer became less dense and distorted (Fig. 1d) . Treatment with 0.4 mM DDM removed the outer layer (Fig. 1e ), but the capsid shell was retained, and viral particles became round. We also observed that the morphology of the viral particles was completely damaged after 50% (v/v) chloroform treatment (data not shown).

When normalized to appropriate internal standards, individual classes of lipids (and their individual members) can be presented as a molar percentage of total lipids (Guan et al., 2006) . The results are summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary data Fig. S3 . The major phospholipid components of SGIV consisted of PC, ePC, PI and SM ( Table 1 ). The molar ratios of PI (18.85 \u00b1 0.98) were higher than those of PE (2.28 \u00b1 0.51), pPE (4.25 \u00b1 1.51) and PS (1.97 \u00b1 0.45). This high proportion of PI in SGIV is distinctive from its relative abundance in reported mammalian viruses, in which the molar ratio of PI was greatly lower than those of PE, pPE and PS (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006; McSharry and London, 1971; Schlesinger et al., 1973) . The relative high proportion of PI was also observed in an iridescent virus type 6 analyzed by TLC (Balange-Orange and Devauchelle, 1982) and other invertebrate iridescent viruses analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (Williams and Thompson, 1995) , suggesting that the high abundance of PI might be a common feature of iridoviruses. Among the invertebrate iridoviruses, the major fatty acids were C18:1 and C16:0, taking approximate 50% of total fatty acids. However, the three most abundant PI species of SGIV were PI 36:2, -38:3 and -38:4, representing a total of 56% of 18 PI species measured ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ), which were different from the fatty acid contents of invertebrate iridoviruses.",

The abundance of both PIP and PIP2 were significantly lower in SGIV compared to that of GECs (Fig. 2) , unlike their enrichment reported in retrovirus envelopes (Chan et al., 2008) . The Chol/PC ratio of SGIV was higher than that of GECs. It was believed that higher molar ratio of Chol may help stabilization of viral lipid layer in mammalian viruses (Laliberte et al., 2007; Megha and London, 2004) . In addition, the coexistence of the two forms of infectious viruses, namely extracellular and intracellular viruses, was observed and intensively studied in rabies viruses (Schlesinger et al., 1973) and vaccinia viruses (Mercer and Helenius, 2008; Roberts and Smith, 2008) . However, we failed to isolate such enveloped extracellular viruses despite enormous efforts including using classical sucrose and potassium tartrate gradients. The enveloped viruses were only observed occasionally by electron micrography of ultrathin sections of infected cells (Chew et al., 1994; Qin et al., 2001) . It reaffirmed that SGIV infection produces the two forms of mature virions, but a vast majority are the intracellular virions.",

OG and DDM are mild detergents and commonly used in protein crystallization to improve protein solubility while retaining proteins in their natural conformations. Treatment with 0.4 mM DDM abolished viral infectivity by 99.99%, a drop of viral titer from 10 6.54 to 10 2.54 . However, OG seemed less effective in reducing infectivity when it was used at the same concentration as DDM. Treatment with 0.4 mM OG reduced infectivity by just 30%. Interestingly, it was reported that disruption of the lipid bilayer in invertebrate iridescent viruses had a profound effect on their ability to infect cultured cells but not to infect whole insects when the virus was injected into the haemocoel (Martinez et al., 2003) , suggesting that viruses may take different routes to establish an infection in vivo from in vitro.

            "text": "To further explore the viral lipid characteristics, we performed enzymatic digestion of intact viruses with PLA2, PLC and Smase. PLA2 hydrolyzes phospholipids at the sn-2 position to form fatty acid and lysophospholipid products. PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol to yield diacylglycerol and a phosphate-containing head group, whereas Smase hydrolyzes SM yielding ceramide and phosphocholine. The perturbation of viral lipids by PLC, Smase as well as a combination treatment with the two enzymes slightly affected viral infectivity, leading to a reduction of infectivity by 18%, 22% and 35%, respectively. However, the PLA2 treatment resulted in a drop of 96% of infectivity compared with mock-treated viruses (Fig. 3c ). PLA2 treatment resulted in a similar effect on the frog virus 3 (FV3) (Willis and Granoff, 1974) , but no effect on invertebrate iridescent viruses (Martinez et al., 2003) , which hint that the composition and role of phospholipids may differ between vertebrate and invertebrate iridoviruses. The lipid contents of enveloped viruses are usually crucial for infectivity. Our results indicate that the lipids in a non-typically enveloped virus are also important for maintaining infectivity. Nevertheless, viruses without an envelope structure may capture some lipids on its surface that enhance its infectivity. Studies of human viruses indicated that viral entry involves single lipid species and lipid raft (Laliberte and Moss, 2009; Marsh and Helenius, 2006) . A study of FV3, a prototype of Ranavirus, proposed that the enveloped viral particle were internalized by endocytosis, while uneveloped particles entered the host cells by fusion between the virus shell and the cellular membranes (Braunwald et al., 1985) . For SGIV, our hypothesis is that lipids in the outer layer of intracellular viruses may facilitate the viral particles to bind to cellular membrane and subsequent fusion with plasma membrane, while the viral internal lipid membrane may facilitate uptake by the intracellular organelles.",

Treatment of SGIV with 0.4 mM DDM triggered a more than 90% loss of most lipids except for PS, which was only reduced by 42% (Fig. 2d) . Treatment with LPA2 resulted in a general hydrolysis of phospholipids, and SM was retained in the virus. When SGIV was incubated with PLC, PI was specficially hydrolyzed and other lipids did not seem to be affected. However, the treatment with SMase resulted in the removal of SM species as well as other phospholipids. These results suggest that SM and phospholipids may be arranged so that phospholipids are situated in the outer surface of the viral outer layer or that SM may link to other viral components such as capsid proteins. On the other hand, PI, which was found to be in a higher abundance than many other lipids, did not appear to have such an interconnection with other lipids since its loss was specific.",

A total of ten proteins were identified by MS/MS (Table 2 ). ORF075 was one of the abundant structure proteins (Song et al., 2006) , showing an obvious reduction in treated viral particles (Supplementary Fig S4a) . ORF52L and ORF60R with a predicted molecular mass of 109 kDa were identified from the gel bands at a migration distance equivalent to a 40-kDa entity. This result indicated that these two proteins might be fragmented by 0.4 mM DDM treatment and migrated faster during SDS-PAGE. The protein peptides corresponding to these proteins were therefore identified from the location of 40 kDa entity. Proteins listed in Table 2 are promising targets for identification of lipid binding proteins and viral surface proteins. In contrast, enzyme treatments did Taken together, although both lipase and detergent treatments reduced viral infectivity in our experimental conditions; DDM (0.4 mM) triggered a more serious loss of infectivity than did the lipases. This may be because the DDM treatment leaded to the dissociation of both lipids and proteins from the viral particles, whereas the lipase treatments only depleted certain lipids from the viral particles. Selective depletion of enriched viral lipids did result in the reduction of infectivity, but that reduction was limited. It is interesting to note that the conformation of proteins that play a role in membrane fusion during viral entry is affected by surrounding lipids in HIV, influenza virus and SARS coronavirus (Qiang and Weliky, 2009, Guill\u00e9n et al., 2008) . When the fusion peptide (FP, the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 gp41) was associated with cholesterol-containing membranes, the FP correlated with beta strand conformation while association with membranes without cholesterol resulted in a mixture of helical and beta strand conformations. Studies of SARS FP revealed that the peptide organization is different depending if it is in water or bound to the membrane. Our results hint at the cooperation roles of viral lipids and proteins in the viral infectivity. The association of lipids and viral capsid proteins may be involved in the merging of the viral external layer and target cell membranes.",

A study on a lipid binding protein ORF-9b from the SARS coronavirus revealed that lipid binding was important for intracellular trafficking of the protein and viral assembly (Meier et al., 2006) .

Unexpectedly, we observed that lipid profiles of uninfected GECs changed over time. The molar ratios of PI and ePC increased, while those of Cer, MH, DH and dihydrosphingomyelin (DHSM) decreased from day 1 to day 3. The increase in PI was mainly attributed to PI -36:1, -36:0 and -38:1, whereas the increase in ePC showed a distinct pattern, i.e., all measured saturated and monounsaturated ePC molecules increased, but polyunsaturated species did not. In contrast, the overall abundance of sphingolipids decreased over the 3 days (Table 1 and  Supplementary Table S1 , Supplementary Fig. S3) . A previous study on human skin fibroblasts has revealed that lipid biosynthesis might be involved in the regulation of cell growth and is dependent on cell density (Vukelic and Kalanj-Bognar, 2001) . The changes in the uninfected GEC lipids may be triggered by similar factors, including alterations in cell density, nutrients and medium pH values. Due to the changes of uninfected GEC lipids over time, better understanding of host cell lipid dynamics in the context of virus infection will require further bioinformatics analysis and/or experimental investigations. Nevertheless, we present here an analysis of those changes, which might be related to apoptosis, to highlight the importance of further study of these lipids. Several members in the Iridoviridae can induce apoptosis during infection (Chinchar et al., 2003; Chitnis et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2007; Imajoh et al., 2004) , but apoptosis caused by SGIV infection has not been reported previously. Morphological changes of SGIV-infected cells related to apoptosis, such as cell shrinkage (Fig. 6a) and apoptotic body-like blebbing (Fig. 6b) were observed. PS translocation to the cell surface, as a marker of earlystage apoptosis, was also detected in SGIV-infected GECs by Annexin-V labeling (Figs. 6c and d) for the first time in this study.",

Concurrently, SGIV infection significantly increased the molar ratio of ePC (p b 0.01) at day 1. Previous studies of the apoptosis of hematopoietic progenitor cells found a decrease of PE and PC and a concomitant increase of ePC (Fuchs et al., 2007.) , which is similar to our observation in SGIVinfected GECs. These results provide an insight into the possible relationship between apoptosis and metabolic changes of lipids in SGIV-infected cells for the first time.",

Isocratic elution was achieved using Chol/ Meth/100 mM ammonium acetate (1:1:2%, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 400 \u03bcl/min as a mobile phase. The ion source temperature was set at 300\u00b0C while the declustering potential and collision energy was set at \u00b130 eV and \u00b110 eV for positive and negative modes, respectively. The mass spectrum was acquired in the negative mode from 400 to 1300 m/z while the positive mode was acquired from 300 to 1300 m/z at a rate of one scan per second for a total of 18 min. Lipids were dissolved in Chol/Meth (1:1, v/v) and 30 \u03bcl of the sample was injected for analysis. The spectra data were produced by integrating the chromatogram from about 3 to 16 min. Chol levels were calculated by normalizing the 369 m/z peak intensity against the total PC peak intensity. A cholesterol-to-PC molar ratio (Chol/PC ratio) was used to compare the Chol abundance among the samples (Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006) .",

More than 220 lipid species were measured in this method. The total lipid and sphingolipid extracts were dissolved in Chol/Meth (1:1, v/v) and, typically, 10 to 15 \u03bcl of samples were injected. For the PIPn samples, the lipids were dissolved in Chol-Meth 1:1, spiked with 10% piperidine solution (300 ng/ml) and injected directly into the mass spectrometer. The signal intensity obtained for each lipid species was converted to its molar equivalent by normalization to the appropriate internal standard. Molar percentage of lipid composition was calculated as described previously (Schlesinger et al., 1973) . The standard deviations represent the differences in at least three sets of replicates, i.e., n \u2265 3. Lipid composition of the SGIV was compared with that of uninfected GECs of the day 1 sample to identify differences. A day-to-day comparison of lipid composition between infected and uninfected GECs was carried out to examine the changes of GEC lipid profiles. The significance of observed differences was determined using the twotailed Student's t-test at the p = 0.05 (represented by one asterisk) or 0.01 (represented by two asterisks) levels.",
