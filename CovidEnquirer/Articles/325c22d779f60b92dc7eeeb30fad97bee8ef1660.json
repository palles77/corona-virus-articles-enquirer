The conjugated immune complex was made with specific anti-IgA antibody and labelled IgA. The specific rabbit anti-IgA was made after several passages through IgG and IgM Sephacryl S-300 immunosorbent columns (Wright and Hunter, 1982) . The purity of the antibodies was tested with the ELISA technique until the optical density of the reaction was less than 0.05 against IgG and IgM (plate coated with 0.1 mg/ml). Different dilutions of these 2 substances (antibody and IgA-peroxidase) were mixed for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, and gently shaken with a stirring movement (200 rpm, Gyrotary shaker G10). The soluble complex was immediately used for the ELISA reaction (100/~l/well, 2 h, 37\u00b0C).",
