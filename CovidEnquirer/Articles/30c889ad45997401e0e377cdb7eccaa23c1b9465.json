The PRRSV genome is a positive-stranded polyadenylated RNA of about 15 kb. In infected cells, a 3' coterminal nested set of six major subgenomic mRNAs could be demonstrated. Within the 3' terminal 3.5 kb of the PRRSV genome, six overlapping reading frames (ORFs) were identified, each most likely expressed by one of the subgenomic mRNAs. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that the most 3' terminal ORF (ORF7) encodes the PRRSVnucleocapsid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 14 kna. It displays 44.8% amino acid identity with the capsid protein of lactate dehydroqenase-elevatinq virus (LOV) and 23.6% with that of equine arteritis virus (EAV). The product of ORF6, the second 3' terminal ORF, represents a putative membrane protein and exhibits 53.2 and 27.2% amino acid identity with the corresponding LOV and EAV polypeptides, respectively. Similar to EAV, ORFs 2 through 5 might encode glycosylated viral proteins. The polypeptide deduced from the most 5' ORF (ORF1b) contains two conserved domains common to EAV and coronavirus potymerases. Genome organization, strategy of gene expression, and the sequence of deduced proteins show that PRRSV belongs to the Arterivirus group of viruses.",

For arteriviruses, similar sizes of genomic RNAs have been described, namely 13 kb for EAV and 13 to 14 kb for LDV (Den Boon et al., 1991; Godeny et al., 1990; Kuo et al., 1991) . It seemed likely that PRRSV genomic RNA also terminates with a poly(A) tail. Acco rdingly, oligo(dT) was employed for priming of an analyticai first cDNA strand synthesis, w here efficient incorporation of [a-32 P)-labeled dCTP occurr ed (not show n}. To investigate whether the labeled cDNA originated mainly from the viral RNA or from contaminating cellular RNAs, Northern hybridizations were performed with tot al RNA from PRRSV-infected and noninfected macrophag es. Prominent specifi c bands appeared with t he RNA of infected cells , wh ile only faint hybridization signals were obtained with RN A from noninfected cells (Fig. 1) . The largest hybridizing RNA population corresponded in size to the supposed 15-kb PRRSV genomic RNA. In addition, a set of subgenomic RNAs in the range of 0.9 to 3.7 kb were observed. Thus the bulk of eDNA primed w ith oligo(dT} originated from PRRSV RNA wh ich is obviousl y polyadenylated. Using again oligo(dT) as a primer, preparative eDNA synthesis was performed . A cDNA bank was established in XZAPII phages and sc reened with the labeled singlestranded eDNA probe.

            "text": "The PRRSV genomic RNA, with an estimated size of nearly 15 kb, is the largest of the arterivirus group; viral RNAs from LDV, EAV, and SHFV range between 12 and 13 kb (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) . Sequence analysis of the 3' terminal 5 kb of the PRRSV genome revealed that its organization is identical to that of EAV. As in EAV, six small, partially overlapping ORFs are expressed via transcription of a set of 3' coterminal subgenomic mRNAs. There is evidence that PRRSV mRNAs also possess a common 5' leader sequence (not shown). As suggested by the comparison of deduced protein sequences, the gene order is similar to the one of EAV. The PRRSV nucleocapsid gene is located at the 3' end of the genome and is preceded by an ORF encoding a well-conserved putative membrane-spanning protein. The four upstream ORFs probably encode glycosylated envelope proteins of lower conservation. PRRSV and EAV ORF2 proteins and ORF5 polypeptides display some similarity in hydropathy, indicating that they might represent corresponding proteins, but such similarities could not be observed for ORF3 or ORF4 polypeptides. While the ORF3 polypeptides show the most striking length difference of the deduced PRRSV and EAV proteins (265 and 163 aa, respectively), they resemble each other by possessing the highest number of potential N-glycosylation sites (6 and 7, respectively). Thus, they may represent highly divergent viral glycoproteins.",

Thus, as indicated already by the data obtained from the comparison of PRRSV and EAV proteins, the putative membrane protein (ORF6) is apparently the most conserved structural protein among members of the arterivirus group.

The length of the PRRSV leader has not yet been determined exactly, but It exceeds 200 nucleotides (unpublished results). While in EAV every ORF is preceded by the junction site motif TCAAC (Den Boon et al., 1991) , for LDV, different motifs have been suggested, TAACCA in RNAs 5, 6, and 8, and TAAAACC in RNA 7 (Kuo et al., 1992) .

Of the 10 nucleotides adjacent to the poly(A) tail, 8 are identical in PRRSV and LDV, and only five are conserved in the EAV genome. Notably, an octanucleotide sequence identical to the EAV polyadenylation site, is found in the PRRSV genome 22 nucleotides upstream.

In addition, after introduction of a gap in the LDV sequence some residues identical in all three virus sequences are observed (Fig. 6 ).

Both the organization of the polymerase genes which supposedly possess a common ancestor (Den Boon et al., 1991) and the transcription of multiple 3' terminal mRNAs suggest relationships of arteriviruses, coronaviruses, and toroviruses. As a consequence the establishment of a new \"coronaviruslike\" superfamily was proposed Snijder et et., 1990; Spaan et al., 1990) . However, the smaller genome size (about half of coronavirus genome), the extent of the leader (approximately triple of coronavirus leader), the overlapping of reading frames and also morphological data clearly distinguish arteriviruses from coronaviruses. It remains to be determined, whether the mode of arteri and corenavirus transcription is identical. According to the current data coronavirus RNAs are generated independently by leader primed transcription (review; l.ai, 1986; Spaan et et., 1988) , and in addition, minus sense subgenomic RNAs might function as replicons (Sethna et al., 1989; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990) . In contrast, EAV UV transcription mapping had indicated the presence of genome length precursors (Van Berlo et et., 1982) and thus alternative RNA splicing mechanisms were assumed to be responsible for EAV leader/mRNA linking (De Vries et aI., 1990) . However, coronaviruslike mechanisms are not excluded (Den Boon et al., 1991) . Further detailed analysis at arterivirus transcription mechanisms will elucidate their evolutionary relationship with ooronavirusas.",
