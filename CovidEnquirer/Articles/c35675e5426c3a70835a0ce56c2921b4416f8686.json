In particular, the critical care component of many disaster response plans is incomplete. Equally important, routinely available critical care resources are almost always insufficient to respond to disasters that generate anything beyond a 'modest' casualty stream. Large-scale monetary funding to effectively remedy these shortfalls is unavailable. Education, training, and improved planning are our most effective initial steps. We suggest several areas for further development, including dual usage of resources that may specifically augment critical care disaster medical capabilities over time.",

We define disaster medicine as a human response to unexpected mayhem, with the intent to limit death, disease, and injury. In recent decades, disaster medical response has largely focused on prehospital care issues such as casualty evacuation, triage, and transport, without specific emphasis on hospital management. In the United States, this phenomenon is referred to as 'ambulances to nowhere'. Recent experiences with large-scale disasters have strongly reinforced the fact that hospital capacity is the major rate-limiting factor in the chain of medical response. This is especially true for critical care services and intensive care unit (ICU) bed capacity [2] . As we continue working to build adequate disaster medical response systems we must maintain our prehospital readiness efforts, and we must expand our focus to more precisely define the hospital and the ICU as critical links in the entire response process. The purpose of the present commentary is to explore ways in which this expansion of focus might be conceived.",

Within a few hours of the Madrid bombing explosions in March 2004, 27 critically ill patients were admitted to the two closest hospitals, which had a maximum ICU capacity of 28 beds, most of which were already occupied [3] . After the terrorist bombing in Bali, the Royal Darwin Hospital in Australia, with a capacity to care for a maximum of 12 ventilated patients, was presented with 20 critically ill patients, 15 of whom required mechanical ventilation [4] . Flooding due to heavy rain in June 2001 crippled the Texas Medical Center in Houston, and resulted in a sudden loss of 75% of the ICU bed capacity for a county of 4 million people [5] . And it is not just ICU bed capacity that is subject to being overwhelmed. Damage to the physical and organizational structure of the hospital may wipe out an entire critical care infrastructure. Some disasters may harm healthcare workers, thus limiting available ICU personnel. This was the case during the Tokyo Sarin gas subway attack in 1995, and more recently during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Canada and Asia [6] .",

An analysis of the capacity of a 1200-bed hospital in the United States to handle patients in the setting of a toxic chemical exposure event revealed an ability to handle only two chemically contaminated patients at a time [8] . Add to this the fact that in many countries, because of efficiency and budgetary constraints, hospitals are shrinking in capacity. This has resulted in hospitals working at or near maximum capacity every day, with associated logistical concerns such as overcrowding, diversion of ambulance services, and lack of surge capacity. Particularly important is the inability of emergency departments to move critically ill patients to their inpatient setting [9] due to the unavailability of staffed critical care beds. With future projections for a shortage of critical care physicians [10] and critical care nurses [11, 12] , these logistical barriers to ICU care will persist [13] and will influence the provision of disaster critical care response.",
