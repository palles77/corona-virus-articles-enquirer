            "text": "Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections through either inhibiting or killing the target bacteria. The first antibiotic was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, called penicillin and saved the lives of millions of people. However, the discovery of penicillin as a modern medication was preceded by the management of microbial infections in Egypt, Greece and ancient China [1] . Shortly after the discovery of penicillin, the bacterial resistance to this antibiotic became one of the challenges in the treatment of bacterial infections. Therefore, new generation of beta-lactam antibiotics was developed to overcome antibiotic resistance and to treat bacterial infections. However, the first case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was reported in England in 1962 [2, 3] . The production and discovery of new antibiotics continue to this day and new antibiotics are marketed to counteract the drug resistance problem. Yet, the point should be raised that one day antibiotics can no longer affect bacteria and will no longer be able to control bacterial infections. Consequently, in recent years, researchers have devised other means to treat bacterial infections. One of such approaches is the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) or \"peptide antibiotics\" to kill pathogenic bacteria and to treat bacterial infections [4] . Over the past decades, antimicrobial peptides (peptide antibiotics) have been shown to be effective in innate immunity of various species, such as plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. The intrinsic immune system is the first line of defense against the attack of microorganisms, among which the antimicrobial peptide molecules are the most important ones. The cathelicidin family is important antimicrobial agents in mammals [5, 6] . These peptides are mainly stored in lysosomes of macrophages (MQ) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) [7] . Cathelicidins have been isolated from many cell types including neutrophils to coordinate the immune system, but have been found in other immune cells such as epithelial cells and macrophages and have been shown to combat against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Cathelicidins have a variety of sizes (12-80 amino acids) and also have a wide range of structures [8] . The molecular mechanism of antimicrobial peptides has been investigated [9] . Stem cells have been the focus of research because they have shown good potential in the field of therapy [10] . One of the features of the stem cells referred to in this review is antimicrobial activity of mesenchymal stem cells that perform this action through antimicrobial peptides such as ll-37, Hepcidin and \u03b2-Defensin-2 [11] . The purpose of this study is to briefly review mesenchymal stem cells and antimicrobial peptides and how these peptides function.",

The peptide constitutes of 39 Monocyte [28] amino acids whose N-terminal is FALL and the name of the peptide was coined for FALL. The helical structure of this peptide was investigated in a saline environment containing vitamin E upon synthesis and antibacterial activity was investigated [9] . The peptide is specifically secreted in the secondary granules of neutrophils. It is also produced by many types of cells, including macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, epithelial cells of the skin, airways, eyes and intestinal tract. Also, the expression of the peptide LL-37 is controlled by inflammatory pathways, similar to the pathway of vitamin D [19] . In addition to antimicrobial activity, this peptide has immunomodulatory roles. For example, exposure to 10 \u03bcg/ml of LL-37 peptide during a monocyte-macrophage differentiation leads to a positive inflammatory response, resulting in a decrease in the level of interleukin 10 and an adjustment of 12p40. In addition, the peptide LL-37 leads to the phenotype M1, which suggests that this peptide has an important role in the development of macrophages and cytokine production [20] .",

In addition, transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) released from the epithelial cells of the intestine after exposure to LL-37 has an effect on the migration of epithelial cells and improved response. It is concluded that the peptide LL-37 is spread at the site of the infection, causing inflammatory response and wound healing [20, 21, 22] . LL-37 peptide has different activities, all of which lead to antimicrobial activity. These include regeneration and angiogenesis, which is done by the formyl-peptide receptor-like 1 expressed on the endothelial cells [23] . Chemotaxis is also one of the activities of this peptide, which causes the migration of mast cells to the environment [24] . In addition, degranulation of mast cells and the release of inflammatory mediators takes place by the LL-37 peptide [25] . LL-37 peptide, on the other hand, induces many cytokines and induces the production of antibodies [26] . LL-37 peptide from primary human keratinocytes and human keratinocytes (HaCaT) cells protect from apoptosis [27] . The results have shown that fluid membrane-associated peptides increases the plasma membrane of the subcutaneous glandular cells [28] . This peptide also considered as an endotoxin, which inhibits the responses of inflammatory proteins to the bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in human cells (Fig. 1) [29].",

This peptide is effective on a wide range of fungi, bacteria and viruses. One of the most important effects of hepcidin in the body is the regulation of iron hemostasis. This peptide prevents iron absorption from the small intestine and releases iron from reticuloendothelial cells. In infectious diseases, macrophages and bacteria compete to absorb iron [37] . Macrophages interfere with the absorption of iron by bacteria. Eventually, the pathogen does not grow and replenish. Factors that cause hepcidin production are increased in bone marrow and anemia. Other factors that increase the production of hepcidin are iron accumulation and inflammation [38] .",

One of the most important treatments used to kill pathogenic bacteria is the use of antibiotics, which has some disadvantages in addition to its benefits. Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest treatment problems with antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance is on the rise and the number of resistant are constantly circulating in the communities and it can be said that it will not last long as antibiotics will no longer be effective against bacteria [47, 48] . An emerging approach to treat infections is the use of antimicrobial peptides produced from various cells, including MSCs. Research has shown that MSCs have antimicrobial properties and this property is related to the production of antimicrobial peptides (Fig. 5 ) [14] .",

As a result, it is better to use mesenchymal stem cells in treatment if the treatments that have been used so far are no longer effective. On the other hand, the use of mesenchymal stem cells as a treatment has many benefits, one of which is the lack of damage that is usually caused by chemical treatments on the body. The use of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of bacterial infections can reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance [50] .",
