Subsequent improvements in the techniques for identifying respiratory viruses made it seem desirable to carry out a further study, using the same general methods and, in particular, the same definition of an exacerbation. In order to investigate possible geographical differences, two groups of men were followed up in the present study, one in Edinburgh and one in London. Great care was taken to standardize the methods used in each centre.",

They were seen as soon as possible after the receipt of this notification, and were questioned about the following symptoms: coryza, sore throat, hoarseness, increased cough, increased wheeze, increased sputum and a change in colour of sputum to green or yellow.

Inoculation was also made into cultures of HEp2 cells which were maintained stationary at 36\u00b0C. All cultures were observed for three weeks and, if there was no evidence of the presence of virus, discarded. If, however, the cells had degenerated a second passage in similar cells was made for at least a further week. Monkey kidney cultures were tested twice weekly for haemadsorption, using guinea pig erythrocytes. The diagnostic sera used for most identification purposes were supplied by the Standards Laboratory for Serological Reagents, Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale. Rhinoviruses were identified by their cytopathic effect in MRC5 cell cultures and by their lability to acid. A selective diphasic medium, similar to that described by Chanock et al.

(1979) , who postulated that one essential factor must be some defect in the defences of the lower respiratory tract against viral infection. The highly significant difference between the isolation rates of rhinoviruses in exacerbations and routine attendances suggests that in patients with chronic bronchitis infection by rhinoviruses is seldom confined to the upper respiratory tract and that these agents have a particular tendency to provoke an exacerbation. It seems probable that their importance is due to their large number of antigenically distinct serotypes (Roebuck 1976 ) and the absence of cross-immunity between them (Minor et al. 1974b; Horn et al. 1979) . Thus, if a bronchitic is infected by a rhinovirus he would be unlikely to escape an exacerbation unless he was immune as a result of a recent infection with that particular serotype. Lambert and Stern (1972) drew attention to the importance of family structure as a determinant of the risk of infection in patients with chronic chest disease. In both the previous and the present study a quarter of the patients had children in their households. In the study by Eadie et al. (1966) , in which they demonstrated rhinovirus infection in 23% of exacerbations in chronic bronchitics, a higher proportion (39%) of households contained children.",

            "text": "Influenza is well recognized to be a danger to chronic bronchitics and it was surprising that infection by influenza A and B viruses seldom occurred in either the Edinburgh or London patients, despite epidemics during two of the three winters of the present study. Whereas in the previous study these viruses accounted for almost half of all those identified in exacerbations, they were seldom associated with exacerbations in the present study, despite the fact that only four patients received influenza vaccine during the study. Although sputum eosinophilia is commonly believed to be a distinguishing feature between chronic obstructive bronchitis and asthma, other workers have also found sputum eosinophilia in patients with chronic respiratory disease who did not apparently have asthma. In 30 patients, described as having emphysema, Cole et al. (1959) examined sputum daily for 28 consecutive weeks. In half the patients they observed periodic 'showers' of eosinophils with counts between 40% and 100% which lasted a few days and occurred every few weeks. Their observations were similar to our own, as was their failure to find any correlation between eosinophilia and changes in symptoms or meteorological conditions. Miller (1963) studied 1174 working men and found that 39% of them had sputum eosinophilia at some time. O'Connell et al. (1978) studied 115 men with chronic bronchitis, asthma or both to determine the diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications of sputum eosinophilia. They, too, found no correlation with positive skin tests. They concluded that sputum eosinophilia was of little value for distinguishing between chronic bronchitis and asthma and they postulated the existence of local allergic and non-allergic factors which might be responsible for eosinophil release in the bronchi.",

Our finding of the high frequency of sputum eosinophilia led to subsidiary studies by Turnbull et al. (1977 Turnbull et al. ( , 1978a . They demonstrated that IgE and mediators of type 1 hypersensitivity were frequently present in the sputum of chronic bronchitics and they also showed a significant inverse relationship between the concentration of these mediators and changes in airflow obstruction, measured by serial PEF. Our findings and theirs suggest that hypersensitivity reactions may play a part in at least some exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. This possibility needs to be explored further.",
