Dormitzer Vaccine design is progressing from empiricism towards the increasingly rational presentation of the targets of protective immunity. Nevertheless, most current vaccine antigens are essentially the native macromolecules of pathogens. These molecules are adapted to evade, not induce, immunity. High resolution structures reveal the electrostatic surfaces recognized by neutralizing antibodies and the architectures underlying these surfaces, thereby identifying which substructures must be left intact and which can be changed to optimize biochemical and immunologic performance. Armed with detailed structural information, we can engineer optimized antigens that are more stable, homogeneous, and efficiently produced, making immunization more practical and affordable. Understanding the structural basis for immunogenicity and immunodominance will allow us to improve vaccine efficacy and broaden the range of vaccine-preventable diseases.",

            "text": "Glossary Adjuvant: a substance added to an antigen to enhance or modulate the immune response to the antigen in an immunized host. Affinity maturation: the process by which B cells produce antibodies with increased affinity for an antigen upon repeated or prolonged stimulation with the antigen. First, rearranged immunoglobulin genes in activated B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, which alters the complementarity-determining regions of the encoded antibodies. Second, B cells that express the mutated immunoglobulins undergo clonal selection. During clonal selection, B cells bearing immunoglobulins with greater affinity for a limited supply of antigen proliferate more than those bearing immunoglobulins with lower affinity. Affinity maturation requires T cell help. Analytical ultracentrifugation: a technique to measure hydrodynamic characteristics of particles. The distribution of the particles in solution is measured over time in a spinning rotor, allowing observation of the particles' sedimentation and diffusion. The technique provides information on the size and shape of particles, including noncovalently associated complexes, and on the equilibrium between different associated states of the molecules. Circular dichroism spectroscopy: a technique that measures the differential absorption of left-or right-handed circularly polarized light by chiral molecules, such as proteins, in solution. A spectrum of the differential absorption (or ellipticity) of light as a function of wavelength provides information on protein secondary structure composition. Circular dichroism spectroscopy can be used to determine the thermal stability of a protein by determining the temperature at which ordered secondary structure is lost. Conjugation: linking a carbohydrate antigen to a protein carrier. The protein carrier elicits T cell help to generate an immune response that includes antibodies against the carbohydrate. Deuterium exchange mass spectrometry: a technique that allows information about protein conformation to be obtained by mass spectrometry. Solvent exposed backbone amide (and some side chain) hydrogens exchange with deuterium in solution. At lowered pH and temperature, exchange slows. The charge-to-mass ratios of protein fragments are then determined by mass spectrometry. Comparison of masses from native and deuterium exchanged samples allows determination of which regions of a protein were exposed to solvent and which were buried when deuterium exchange was taking place.",

            "text": "Differential scanning calorimetry: a technique that measures the absorption of heat by a solution as a function of temperature. If the solution contains a macromolecule, the variation in the absorption of heat as the temperature is raised gives information on the unfolding of the macromolecule. Domain: as used by structural biologists, a part of a protein that forms a coherent folded unit. The structural elements of a domain have more intimate interactions with other parts of the domain than they do with parts of the protein outside the domain. Dynamic light scattering: a technique that allows measurement of diffusion coefficients based on the variation in the amount of light scattered by a small volume of suspended particles over time. Based on assumptions about the shapes of the particles, the diffusion coefficients may be used to estimate the size distribution of the particles. The technique is often used to measure polydispersity, the amount of variation in particle size. Electron cryomicroscopy: an electron microscopic technique in which specimens are imaged after being embedded in vitreous (glass-like, rather than crystalline) ice. Computational averaging and refinement of the resulting low contrast data can yield image reconstructions of biological specimens at considerably higher resolution than conventional electron micrographs of specimens embedded in negative stains that contain heavy atoms to enhance contrast. In the most favorable cases, near atomic resolution reconstructions can be achieved. Epitope: the part of an antigen that is recognized by an antibody (or group of antibodies) or a T cell receptor. Escape mutation: a mutation in a gene encoding a microbial antigen that allows the microbe to escape killing or neutralization, typically by an antibody. The position of the altered amino acid residue in an antigen's structure allows inferences about where the selecting neutralizing antibody binds the antigen. Germline antibody repertoire: an organism's collection of antibodies that have not yet been altered by somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation. Isothermal titration calorimetry: a technique that measures the absorption or production of heat by a solution as a second solution is mixed in. If the two solutions contain interacting molecules, the resulting thermodynamic information allows conclusions about the affinity, stoichiometry, and enthalpy of the interaction between the molecules. Mass spectrometry: a technique that measures the mass-to-charge ratio of particles. The technique's very high accuracy and throughput combined with protein fragmentation and computational analysis have greatly expanded the applications of mass spectrometry in protein biochemistry. The technique can be used to identify the proteins present in a mixture and to provide detailed information about a protein's primary structure and post-translational modifications. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: a technique that measures the properties of the magnetic fields that are generated by the protons in some atomic nuclei. The ability of NMR to distinguish protons in a molecule that have different electronic environments; measure the response of a molecule's protons to applied magnetic pulses; and detect the interactions between the magnetic fields generated by protons that are close to each other allow conclusions about molecular structure and dynamics. Opsonization: the enhancement, usually by bound antibodies, of an antigen's uptake into phagocytes, such as antigen presenting cell. Size exclusion chromatography: a technique that separates particles in solution on the basis of their sieving through beads with pores. The rate at which particles pass through a size exclusion column is determined by a combination of their size, shape, and any affinity for the beads. Surface plasmon resonance: a technique that measures the binding of molecules in solution to molecules immobilized on a planar metal substrate (typically gold). Binding is detected by changes in the refractive index immediately adjacent to the metal surface as molecules in solution bind the immobilized molecules. The data allow determination of on-rates, off-rates, and binding constants (K D ). X-ray crystallography: a technique that uses the diffraction of X-rays by molecules packed in a crystalline array to provide information about molecular structure. X-ray crystallography can produce atomic resolution structures of objects ranging in size from very simple compounds to entire viruses. Corresponding author: Dormitzer, P.R.

With the exception of the genetically engineered modification of the polybasic cleavage site in the hemagglutinins of pre-pandemic influenza vaccines [1] , the only significant antigen engineering in licensed vaccines consists of denaturation, detoxification, conjugation, and mixture with or adsorption to adjuvants. Vaccine antigens are not generally engineered using modern genetic techniques and the best available structural data. One exception is a genetically detoxified pertussis toxin [2] that was used as an acellular pertussis vaccine (alone or in combination with diphtheria and tetanus antigens) for several years in Europe. This modification was guided by the structures of the homologous toxins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3] and the diphtheria corynephage [4] .",

For some complex pathogens, the harnessing of genomics through reverse vaccinology is overcoming that barrier. In reverse vaccinology, whole genome sequences of bacteria, fungi, and parasites are mined to discover new protective determinants that were not previously known to be targets of natural immunity [6] . Recombinant expression of these molecules can overcome the low natural abundance that, in many cases, prevented recognition of their potential as vaccine antigens. By increasing the set of native antigens from which to choose, this technique is enabling the development of a new generation of vaccines. The technique has led to the discovery of new protective antigens for pneumococcus [7] and group B streptococcus [8] . Reverse vaccinology vaccine candidates for Staphylococcus aureus [9] and meningococcus B [10, 11] are now in clinical trials.",

Structural data guide the selection of the residues that are mutated to cysteine. For example, the prefusion conformation of influenza HA has been stabilized by tethering the three heads of the HA trimer together through engineered intersubunit cross links [32] . Similarly, the prefusion state of the measles virus F glycoprotein has been stabilized by a disulfide cross-link that was introduced between the top of the coiled-coil and the base of the head of an adjacent subunit [33] . The effects of such modifications on immunogenicity are yet to be determined. Other types of mutations that favor a preferred conformation include those that reinforce or disrupt hydrophobic cores, hydrogen bond networks, or salt bridges, as has been demonstrated in studies of other paramyxovirus F glycoproteins [30, 34] . In theory, engineered mutations could also stabilize other more transient protein conformations, such as those that a fusion protein passes through during the transition between the more stable pre-and post-fusion conformations. Stabilizing transient intermediates could allow the induction of antibodies against conserved epitopes that are exposed too transiently in native molecules to elicit protective antibodies efficiently [35] . Selection of optimized protein antigens will require a comprehensive evaluation of the structural features of the recombinantly produced protein.

Rotavirus infection efficiently elicits neutralizing antibodies against VP7, but immunization with recombinant VP7 does not [36, 37] . During cell entry, VP7 must be shed from the virion, a process termed uncoating [38] . Rotavirus virions uncoat in vitro when calcium is removed by chelation [39] . Uncoating is caused by the dissociation of calcium-dependent VP7 trimers [40] . Neutralizing antibodies inactivate rotavirus by binding specifically to VP7 trimers on the virion, stabilizing them, and preventing uncoating, even in the presence of a calcium chelator [41] . Therefore, VP7 trimers engineered for enhanced stability could more effectively elicit neutralizing antibodies than native VP7, which is in a dynamic equilibrium between monomers and trimers in solution [42] .

            "text": "To engineer antigens, it is not sufficient simply to know the surfaces available for antibody binding. It is also necessary to understand the underlying protein architectures that form these surfaces. For example, understanding the underlying HIV gp120 architecture guides deletion of vari-able loops that bias the repertoire of elicited antibodies away from more conserved parts of the molecule [43, 44] . Understanding underlying architecture also allows the sensible dissection of macromolecules, 'carving proteins at their joints' (interdomain boundaries) into isolated, autonomously folding structural domains that are suitable for independent recombinant expression. In some cases, such as picornavirus capsids, neutralizing epitopes require an intimate co-folding and co-assembly of proteins, so that isolated domains are not apparent, and carving the protein shell into components is not feasible [45] . (An extruded picronavirus protein, VP4, is an exception [46] ). By contrast, other complex neutralization determinants are collections of self-contained subunits, which can be expressed separately. Examples of such subunits include the receptor binding domain of the SARS coronavirus S glycoprotein [47] and the head and body domains of the rotavirus spike protein, VP4 [48, 49] . Studies of rotavirus VP4 (Figure 3 ) illustrate some advantages of reducing a complex and flexible macromolecule to its neutralizing epitope-containing compact domains. Rotavirus VP4 misfolds when expressed in bacteria, and it is susceptible to proteolysis and aggregation during storage. However, all known neutralizing epitopes are present on two compactly folded domains [48, 49] . One of these, corresponding to the 'head' domain of the spike, can be expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli, resists protease digestion, and is stable in solution for years [50] . Similar efficiently produced, compact, and stable neutralization domains from several pathogens are likely to have more homogeneous biochemical characteristics than the multidomain assemblages from which they are derived. Such domains could be optimized further by altering surface-exposed hydrophobic residues that cause aggregation and modifying protease cleavage sites that compromise protein stability. A collection of optimized domains could form the raw materials for combination vaccines that are tailored to particular patient populations and epidemiological circumstances.",

Other strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of antigens include engineering linkages to strong T cell epitopes, as exemplified by glycoconjugate vaccines, in which linkage to proteins that bear T cell epitopes enhances the immunogenicity of bacterial carbohydrate antigens [56] . Linking antigens to B cell epitopes that are recognized by highly prevalent antibodies is another approach to increasing immunogenicity. For example linking domains to tetanus toxoid (against which pre-existing immunity is prevalent as a result of widespread immunization against tetanus) can increase immunogenicity, probably by promoting opsonization [57] .

For example, modifying the HIV gp120 surface by adding glycosylation sites masks epitopes on the altered surfaces [63] . More generally, glycosylation can lead to tolerance, because glycans on viruses replicating in a host are generally recognized as 'self.' This is the most likely explanation for the immunological 'silence' of the most heavily glycosylated face of HIV gp120 [27] . A role for glycosylation in evading immunity in previously exposed or immunized hosts is suggested by the evolution of H3 subtype influenza hemagglutinins since H3N2 strains emerged as human pathogens in 1968. Since then, the number of glycans has progressively increased, particularly on the membrane distal part of the HA1 fragment, where most neutralizing antibodies bind [64] . Analogously, it might be possible to abrogate the immunodominance of variable regions by adding masking oligosaccharides to these regions [63] . Conversely, determining which glycans are important for protein folding and solubility, and which glycans mask epitopes but have no essential structural role could allow elimination of masking glycans to enhance the presentation of conserved neutralizing epitopes [65] [66] [67] .",

High throughput, robotic protein modification systems have been developed to optimize proteins for crystallization [68] . These systems can introduce a series of mutations into a protein-encoding gene, express and purify the mutant proteins, and carry out basic characterization in a fully automated and extremely efficient manner. This technology could also be used to optimize vaccine antigens. A major challenge is to set up high throughput in vitro screens for the characteristics that are relevant to immunogen performance in vivo. The ultimate characteristic of interest, the ability to elicit protective immunity, is not amenable to automated screening. Eventually, ex vivo systems to evaluate immune priming that are capable of predicting immunogenicity in vivo may be developed, thereby greatly facilitating the vaccine antigen discovery process. A research consortium (funded by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is currently working towards this goal. Until an artificial immune system that can be used to rapidly screen antigens for immunogenicity is available, automated screening will be limited to other desirable antigen characteristics, such as expression level, solubility, stability, aggregation state, protease resistance, and epitope presentation (Table 1) .",

By using a conformation-specific mAb to detect molecules with an advantageous conformation, high throughput mutagenesis, expression, and immunoassay could also yield protein variants stabilized in a desired conformation.",

The greater number of protective determinants of bacteria, fungi, and parasites make them suitable for a reverse vaccinology approach to discovering protective determinants with favorable vaccine antigen characteristics [6] . The limited number of protective determinants on most viruses necessitates optimizing a relatively small set of macromolecules. Antigen optimization is not limited to subunit vaccines. Live attenuated, vectored, and viruslike-particle vaccines could also incorporate antigens that have been optimized based on structural insights. Matching the rational design of antigens to advances in the rational design of adjuvants can enable a new generation of vaccines that are more safe, broadly protective, practical, and affordable than those available today.",
