MAbs to gplOO/S reacted with discontinuous epitopes of gplOO/S in Westerns under mild but not under standard denaturing conditions. In contrast, MAbs to p53/N reacted in both types of Westerns, and those epitopes were thus continuous. MAbs to p53/N failed to neutralize BCV infectivity, while 4 MAbs to gplOO/S neutralized BCV effectively. Cross reactivity of MAbs to gplOO/S specified by five virulent wild-type strains and two high passage, cell-culture-adapted strains in mildly denaturing Westerns and neutralization assays indicated that two epitopes were conserved in all seven strains, while two epitopes of the avirulent strains were not detected in the wild-type strains. Non-neutralizing MAbs of gplOO/S reacted with all seven strains in Westerns with the exception of one MAb that was specific for the highly cell-adapted strain BCV-L9.",

Serological variation among 5 BCV strains was observed ( 17). Oral vaccination of newborn calves with attenuated BCV protected against infection by the virulent virus within 2-3 days postimmunization of colostrum-deprived calves (18).

Five other wild-type BCV isolates, initially maintained by calf inoculation, were adapted to HRT-18 cells from diarrhea fluid or intestinal mucosal scrapings of calves with clinical diarrhea and electron micro-scopic evidence of coronavirus infection (21, 22). These strains are: LY-138 (Utah, 1965 ) BCV C-50 (Colorado, 1972 BCV-Miller (Colorado, 1974) BCV-Meeker (Colorado, 1975) and BCV-Fisher (Colorado, 1980) . The vaccine strain of BCV was cultured in HRT-18 cells from the vaccine of Norden Laboratories (Omaha, NE) (20,23). Specific markers of this strain are currently not available. Importantly, cultivation of the BCV wild-type filed strains remained difficult until it was demonstrated that the cytopathic expression of BCV-L9 in cultured bovine cells was enhanced by tt-ypsin (24) and that HRT-18 cells were susceptible to BCV (25).",

MAbs to p53/N reacted similarly against p53/N specified by all strains in both Westerns. Three MAbs to BCV-L9 gplOO/S failed to react with gplOO/S specified by other viral strains with the exception of antibodies 44 and 38 which reacted with the vaccine strain (Table 1) . Specifically, three antigenic types of virus were distinguished. One type was the cell-adapted Mebus strain BCV-L9 used as the immunogen for the isolation of the MAbs. The second type was represented by the modified live virus vaccine strain, which differed from the prototype BCV-L9 through the loss of reactivity to MAb 31. The third antigenic type included all five virulent wild-type isolates, distinguished by their failure to react with MAbs 31, 38, and 44. The infectivity neutralizing ability of MAbs against heterologous BCV strains was tested. MAbs 43F6 and 43C2 neutralized all strains, exhibiting small variations in titers. In contrast, MAbs 38 and 44 neutralized the avirulent BCV-L9 and vaccine strains but failed to neutralize the five wild-type strains ( Table 1) .",

Furthermore, the addition of a reducing agent abolished the antigenic reactivity indicating that disulfide bonds were important in stabilizing the tertiary structure of gpl 00/S. Similar results were reported for gplOO/S specified by the BCV Quebec strain (13).",

In contrast, MAbs to BCV (Quebec-strain) were reported to react with gplOO/S precursors and higher molecular weight aggregates (13). The observed differences in reactivity may be due to the different conditions used to solubilize BCV viral proteins or may reflect viral strain-host cell differences in the relative amounts of processed gplOO/S used to produce the immunogens for the generation of the hybridomas. Comparative reactivity of these sets of MAbs would resolve these differences.",

Cross-reactivity of six out of seven MAbs with gpl 00/S specified by the related avirulent vaccine and BCV-L9 strains infers that these glycoproteins folded into nearly identical conformations. The failure of MAb binding to gplOO/S specified by the wild-type strains implies that their three-dimensional configurations differed significantly. Interestingly, one MAb failed to react with the vaccine strain although it reacted with its progenitor strain BCV-L9. A limited number of replication cycles of the virus in cell culture is evidently sufficient for the emergence of an antigenic variance.",

This is in agreement with findings for coronaviruses from other animals (4, 11, 37, 32) and the Quebec strain of BCV (13). Cross-neutralization studies with MAbs to gplOO/S revealed that wild-type strains were not neutralized by two MAbs. Conformational differences detected by the reactivity in Westerns are thus within antigenic areas that are crucial for virus neutralization. Similar observations were reported for mouse hepatitis virus 4 (31, 33) and the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (10, 11). It is conceivable that con-formational differences in gplOO/S of wild-type strains, as compared to the vaccine stain, result in loss of neutralizing sites with subsequent loss of protection following vaccination. None of the five wild-type BCV strains were cultivatable in bovine fetal spleen cells even in the presence of trypsin (22). A unique plaque morphology characterized each BCV strain grown in . The epitopes to MAb 31, 38, and 44 appear to reflect the wider host cell range of the highly cell-cultured adapted L9 and vaccine strains.",
