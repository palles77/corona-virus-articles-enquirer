In vitro, sarcoid derived fibroblasts are invasive and express matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -1, -2 and -9. It was hypothesised that the MMPs produced by neoplastic cells play a role in both their local invasiveness and interaction with the overlying epidermis (picket fence formation). The objective of this morphological study was to investigate the local behaviour and in situ MMP expression pattern in sarcoids of different clinical types. A total of 43 surgically excised sarcoids were examined by histology, immunohistology for the expression of MMP-1, -2 and -9, and transmission electron microscopy.",

Six clinical types with individual growth characteristics and local behaviour have been described. These include occult, verrucose ('warty'), nodular, fibroblastic, mixed and malignant forms (Knottenbelt, 2005) . Focal dermal accumulations of fibroblastoid cells, usually in association with hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and rete peg formation (RPF) of the overlying epidermis are typical histological features. Neoplastic cells often show 'picket fence' alignment along the epidermis and are generally locally invasive (Marti et al., 1993; Martens et al., 2000; Scott and Miller, 2003) .

In the present in vivo study, histology, immunohistology for MMP-1, -2 and -9, and TEM were used to assess local behaviour and MMP expression patterns in sarcoids. Our study confirms that histology does not allow sub-classification, since all relevant morphological features are observed in all clinical types (Pascoe and Knottenbelt, 1999; Martens et al., 2000; Knottenbelt, 2005) . Hyperplasia and RPF of the overlying epidermis and interaction of neoplastic cells with the epidermis (PFF) were also typically found in all types, to varying extents. Sarcoids are locally aggressive, recur frequently and can progress rapidly from clinically benign to more aggressive forms (Knottenbelt, 2005; Martens et al., 2001b; Marti et al., 1993; Tarwid et al., 1985) . This is reflected histologically by local infiltrative growth of the neoplastic cells (Martens et al., 2000) which we found in association with apparent loosening of the dermal collagen matrix. We observed strong MMP-1 expression by neoplastic cells and MMP-1 deposition in the ECM suggesting that MMP-1 contributes to the ECM changes.",

Expression is regulated at transcriptional level, and induced, for example, by cytokines and growth factors (Shapiro, 1998; Westermarck and K\u00e4h\u00e4ri, 1999; Fields, 2013) . Produced in an inactive form, MMP-1 is activated by several enzymes (K\u00e4h\u00e4ri, 1997; Westermarck and K\u00e4h\u00e4ri, 1999) . In equine sarcoids, MMP-1 is present in its active form (Yuan et al., 2010b) , and its release by neoplastic cells may be responsible for infiltrative dermal tumour growth, via partial destruction of the ECM, i.e. the cleaving of collagen III. This indicates increased ECM turnover, and indeed, sarcoids have been shown to exhibit an overall lower amount of collagen than the normal equine dermis, through an increased and more organised, fibrous collagen III network (Williams et al., 1982) . The fate of the cleaved collagen III remains unclear, since further degrading requires the gelatinases, MMP-2 and -9 (Shapiro, 1998; Visse and Nagase, 2003; Fields, 2013) , neither of which were found to be up regulated in the present nor a previous study (Yuan et al., 2010b) .",

Its upper lamina lucida and lower lamina densa solidly attach the epidermis to the dermis.

The keratin filament of the hemidesmosomes binds to laminin 5 which in turn binds to, among others, collagen VII (McMillan et al., 2003; Breitkreutz et al., 2013) . MMP-1 can degrade laminins and collagen VII; with the destruction of these two proteins, i.e. the anchoring fibrils and one of the two main networks (Shapiro, 1998; Villone et al., 2008) , the BM would lose its normal stable architecture. This could account for the BM destruction seen with PFF in sarcoids and might also render the skin overlying the neoplastic infiltrate more vulnerable and liable to ulceration.",

This is not encountered in sarcoids. However, MMP-2 is also expressed by hyperproliferative keratinocytes (Krengel et al., 2002) which are found in the epidermis overlying equine sarcoids (Martens et al., 2000) . This may account for the slight increase in epidermal MMP-2 expression in some of our cases. The latter was particularly obvious in association with PFF, suggesting that direct contact between the epidermis and fibroblasts is a prerequisite of proliferation (Martens et al., 2000) . Alternatively, BPV-1, found to productively infect the epidermis overlying natural sarcoids , could induce keratinocyte hyperproliferation.",

Similarly, the pronounced MMP-1 expression of neoplastic cells might result from local cytokine release with ulceration, granulation tissue formation and PFF (Westermarck and K\u00e4h\u00e4ri, 1999) . Our observation that normal equine epidermis and follicular and glandular epithelium constitutively express MMP-1 differs from a previous study (Miragliotti et al., 2008) . This could be due to differences in the detection sensitivity since different antibodies and detection systems were used. The equine sarcoid remains a clinical challenge and there remains a high risk of failure with all treatment methods (Knottenbelt and Kelly, 2000) . Invasion is the major constraint to therapy. The likelihood of recurrence is highest with surgical methods that do not include a safe margin but the difficulty in defining a safe margin for any individual lesion is a significant surgical challenge. The likelihood of recurrence is seemingly correlated with the presence of BPV DNA in the surgical margins (Martens et al., 2001c) . Topical and intralesional chemotherapy options may fail because the tumour extends beyond the reach of the chemotherapeutic agent (Knottenbelt and Kelly, 2000) . This study suggests that, excluding the malignant form which we have not examined, the risks of invasion are not significantly different in any particular sarcoid subtype. Early, pre-emptive, use of medications that could alter the tendency to invasion through manipulation of MMP-1 expression might provide improved outcomes when they are subsequently treated either surgically or medically.",

The release of MMP-1 could be responsible for the consistently dermal invasion of the neoplastic cells, through the degradation of collagen III, and could, through partial destruction of the BM, mediate PFF. These results which were obtained in all clinical types of sarcoids suggest potential new approaches for the therapy of sarcoids.",
