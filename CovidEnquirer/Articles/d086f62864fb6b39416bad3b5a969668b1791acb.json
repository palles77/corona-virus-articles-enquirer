            "text": "The enterprise of virulence management attempts to predict how social practices and other factors affect the evolution of parasite virulence. These predictions are often based on parasite optima or evolutionary equilibria derived from models of host-parasite dynamics. Yet even when such models accurately capture the parasite optima, newly invading parasites will typically not be at their optima. Here we show that parasite invasion of a host population can occur despite highly nonoptimal virulence. Fitness improvements soon after invasion may proceed through many steps with wide changes in virulence, because fitness depends on transmission as well as virulence, and transmission improvements can overwhelm nonoptimal virulence. This process is highly sensitive to mutation supply and the strength of selection. Importantly, the same invasion principle applies to the evolution of established parasites, whenever mutants arise that overcome host immunity/resistance. A host population may consequently experience repeated invasions of new parasite variants and possible large shifts in virulence as it evolves in an arms race with the parasite. An experimental study of phage lysis time and examples of mammalian viruses matching some of these characteristics are reviewed.",

They consider how natural selection of parasites is expected to shape the evolution of virulence and other traits toward states that maximize fitness and the parasite optima. The argument put forth here is that this 'optimality' approach is not always suitable, because it assumes equilibrium conditions that some types of parasites may be slow to attain. Even for parasites that are able to evolve an optimum virulence, once a host population has a high density of immune or recovered individuals, then that host population remains vulnerable to invasion by parasite genotypes that escape immunity. During invasion, a much wider range of virulence can spread, at least temporarily, than is evident from evolutionary optima. The frequency of new invasions and the rapidity with which parasites evolve to their optima will dictate how often the host experiences nonoptimal parasite virulence.",

Two standard models are reviewed. They differ in the state of host-parasite dynamics when the virulence optimum is calculated, but they both illustrate the same general approach. Those models are then extended to nonequilibrium conditions. Our use of those simplistic models is for ease of illustration in a familiar context. Our neglect of more complicated processes, such as within-host dynamics (Ball et al. 2007 ), within-host combined with betweenhost dynamics (Gilchrist and Coombs 2006) , or of virulence models that lack optima (Dieckmann 2002) is not to deny the importance of those alternatives. Indeed, the concept of a delayed approach to equilibrium conditions can be applied to many of those and other types of models. Furthermore, the process we describe is fully and properly encompassed in the new formalism of Gandon (2006, 2007) and Day and Proulx (2004) , albeit that their formalism encompasses a far wider range of possibilities than the ones we emphasize.",

            "text": "Optimal virulence theories R 0 perspective The now conventional method for considering the evolution of virulence is about three decades old May 1979, 1982) . It assumes that the parasite population has gone to its dynamic equilibrium (the endemic phase), such that the parasite population is no longer spreading in the host population. This model identifies the combination of transmission and virulence that leads to highest parasite fitness. The result is that selection maximizes the parasite reproductive number, R 0 (or more properly, maximizes R; Day and Gandon 2007) . R 0 is a dimensionless number that equals the number of new infections started during the lifetime of the first infected individual in a susceptible population (R is the number of new infections from an infected individual once the parasite has established itself in the host population.) The formula for R 0 is simply the parasite fecundity rate times the average lifetime of the infection. Although R 0 is defined for the first infected host in a naive population, what maximizes R 0 also maximizes R because the only difference between them lies in the value of S (Ebert and Herre 1996; Day and Gandon 2006; Gilchrist and Coombs 2006) . The result that selection at the dynamic equilibrium favors maximization of R 0 parallels the usual demographic result that selection favors maximal lifetime reproductive output in a stable population (Wilson and Bossert 1971; Charlesworth 1994) . We will expand on the implications of R 0 maximization below, but it is most informative to do so in the broader context of the second virulence evolution model, considered next. Lenski and May (1994) pointed out that selection on parasite parameters was different during the epidemic phase than at dynamic equilibrium: maximizing R 0 no longer maximized fitness if the parasite population was expanding. Again from demography, selection favors early births over late ones in a growing population, so during the epidemic phase, there is a benefit to early transmission and its consequent shorter generation time even when it lowers life-time reproductive success of the infection. In the model, earlier reproduction is achieved by a higher transmission rate, which in most models also results in higher virulence because of an assumed trade-off between transmission and virulence.",

A trade-off means that the parasite cannot increase b without incurring increasing death rates (d), although a more stringent criterion on the trade-off, such as the concavity used here, is required to select intermediate levels of virulence (Sasaki and Iwasa 1991) .

In prior work, the fitness 'optimum' found in this way is usually regarded as the phenotype that the parasite will evolve toward (and will ultimately attain, if the environment does not change). As demonstrated by Lenski and May (1994) , this optimum changes as the density of susceptible hosts is reduced by the parasite, ultimately coinciding with the R 0 maximization (Fig. 1) . Thus, the optimum stops changing when the epidemic is over and the population has reached dynamic equilibrium between host and parasite (and parasite virulence is optimal). Both prior perspectives essentially restrict evolution to the trade-off function, with an emphasis on optima. In the Lenski-May model, the optima are temporary, changing as the density of susceptible hosts changes. Both prior perspectives differ from a new approach that incorporates dynamics, selection and genetics simultaneously (Day and Proulx 2004; Gandon 2006, 2007) . This latter approach allows the virulence and transmission parameters to vary anywhere within the zone of attainable phenotypes, and it maps changes in the mean phenotypes as a function of selection and of genetic covariances between the two traits. The optima in this new approach are not altered, but the model is extended to include the evolutionary and population dynamics. This newer method thus subsumes the former ones.",

Prior to attaining an optimum, however, the evolutionary dynamics apply (as codified by Day and Gandon 2006, for example) . Even before dynamics are relevant, the issue is merely what range of parasite phenotypes/genotypes can invade the host population. The invasion threshold provides the boundary to the range of parameters that allows invasion. It is the set of all (mutant) parameter combinations for which the parasite neither invades nor goes extinct. Thus, parameter values on one side of the invasion threshold will allow invasion, whereas those on the other side will lead to loss/extinction. . Death rate is divided into intrinsic host death rate and virulence -parasite-induced host death rate. The intrinsic host death rate is assumed to be constant, so the virulence-transmission trade-off (dashed curve) emanates from the axis at this value and increases as transmission increases. The trade-off gives the minimum total parasite death rate (d) that could be achieved for a given transmission rate (b), so only points on and above the trade-off boundary are attainable by the parasite (shaded). For simplicity, we henceforth refer to d as virulence, but acknowledge that it is the sum of a constant mortality plus virulence.

During the epidemic phase, the parasite's optimum lies on the dashed tradeoff function and satisfies the condition that the slope of the tangent along the trade-off function equals the current density of hosts, S (upper arrow). As the parasite epidemic reduces the density of susceptible hosts, the optimum shifts progressively further down the tradeoff curve, until dynamic equilibrium is reached, whereby parasite and host densities remain constant. In this state, the parasite optimum maximizes R 0 = b/d, given by the point at which a line through the origin is tangent to the trade-off function (lower arrow). In this paper, we are concerned chiefly with conditions at and shortly after the time of invasion, before the population has reached dynamic equilibrium.",

Indeed, if evolution to the optimum is fast enough, the duration of nonoptimal parasite behavior could be ignored. Yet, the approach to optimum virulence may be slow for a few reasons: (i) the optimum may be changing (Lenski and May 1994) , (ii) virulence evolution will be influenced by the genetic covariance or mutational properties between virulence and transmission (Day and Gandon 2006) , and Conditions for the invasion of a host population of density S* by a parasite with parameters (d, b) are S* > d/b, where d is virulence and b is the transmission rate. Points satisfying S* = d/b lie a line radiating from the origin (of slope S*), so radii with progressively higher slopes represent parasite parameters that can invade only at progressively higher host densities. All parasites whose values fall in the darker shaded region below the line of slope S* and above the dashed trade-off boundary are attainable and can invade, whereas the lightshaded region above the invasion boundary represents values that the parasite can attain but do not allow invasion (for host density S*). The parasite population would eventually evolve toward the dot on the trade-off boundary (arrows), but it could create a potentially highly virulent epidemic from the start of the invasion until the evolutionarily equilibrium virulence was attained. (Bottom) Evolution following invasion may be slow to approach optimal virulence. The rightmost oblique line is a fitness isocline (of slope S*), and all points on it have equal fitness, superior to the fitnesses of all points to its left. Evolution would tend to move parasites progressively toward right-most isoclines, but as a mutant's relative position on the fitness isocline does not affect its fitness, evolution at each step could move virulence further or closer to the optimum (solid point) until the optimum was approached closely. The input of mutations (or genetic covariance between transmission and virulence) thus has a major impact on the evolution of virulence in these early stages (Day and Gandon 2007) . Improved fitness need not greatly restrict the range of virulence values allowed, and indeed, virulence could evolve to deviate further from its optimum during intermediate stages of the adaptation. These arguments apply to constant host density, and if susceptible host density is declining, the fitness isoclines will have progressively shallower slopes.",

As Lenski and May (1994) pointed out, (i) the optimum will shift toward progressively lower virulence values as the density of the susceptible hosts is reduced by the epidemic. Thus the optimum will not be static, and the parasite can do no better than adapt toward the current optimum. Even in the absence of this effect, parasite evolution may be slow to reach the optimum because of (ii), pleiotropy or genetic covariances. Selection favors mutations with a higher fitness than the currently dominant strains. These mutations may improve transmission but may result in virulence further away from its optimum. Fig. 2 (bottom) shows that fitness isoclines run parallel to the invasion boundary, so all points on a fitness isocline have the same fitness, assuming that S remains constant. As can be seen for the trade-off boundary drawn, there is a wide range of virulence associated with each step of evolution toward the optimum, until the optimum is neared (depending on the shape of the trade-off). Thus, particularly during the initial phases of invasion, evolution of higher parasite fitness need not be accompanied by a change in virulence.

In such a system, the initial parasite invasion would be followed by a reduction in host density to the dynamic equilibrium, and the resulting low absolute host density would greatly limit opportunities for the re-invasion of any parasite mutants that had an even more devastating impact on the host. Yet, host death is not the only outcome of infection. Recovery and consequent immunity is typical of many parasites (not necessarily precluding the death of some infected hosts). How does recovery affect our model? Here, we restrict ourselves to the extreme case that recovery is complete, so that a recovered individual cannot be reinfected by the same strain (see van Baalen 1998 for models of virulence evolution with partial recovery). Most basically, if a large fraction of the host population is immune, a large advantage can be gained by parasite mutants that can overcome the host immunity but also retain the ability to infect susceptible hosts (S). Those mutants have their own invasion threshold, and depending on their parameters, those constraints may be much more lenient than the constraints applying to parasites unable to escape host immunity (Fig. 3) . Thus, parasites that engender host immunity have the potential to cause repeated invasions, with potential high and devastating virulence each time. The dynamics of this process are sensitive to the nature of host recovery and virulence, however. A highly virulent parasite (most infections lethal) that reaches high abundance in the host population will crash the host population and not leave many recovered hosts, at least in the short term. Until host numbers rebound, there would be little opportunity for new parasite invasions because of the low absolute density of hosts. If recovery rate from infection is instead high, virulence (host mortality) is necessarily low, and the parasite impact on host density will be slight. In this latter case, the host population is soon prone to invasion of mutants that escape immunity. Thus epidemics that kill large numbers of hosts will experience longer lags before possible reinvasion than epidemics that do not kill many hosts.",

There is obvious overlap among these models (and both are nicely subsumed in the covariance method of Day and Gandon 2006) , but the emphases from them have differed. The R 0 maximization model offers a single optimum, albeit one that may be sensitive to environmental conditions. It assumes dynamic equilibrium exists between host and parasite, hence does not apply when new parasite mutants invade. The other two models, Lenski-May dynamic optimum and the invasion threshold, are similar in that both apply to invasions. The only difference is that one emphasizes the change of virulence optima during the invasion, the other addresses the range of virulence values that can invade and the nonequilibrium states that may persist after invasion. Without knowing the optima, the Lenski-May and invasion threshold perspectives are difficult to distinguish, as either or both could obtain across repeated invasions. However, observing the evolution of an increase in virulence (instead of a decrease) as the epidemic matures would support the invasion threshold model for the initial virulence, because the Lenski-May optima shift toward decreasing virulence as the epidemic matures. Likewise, if hosts merely die from the infection and do not recover (and are not resistant), then the invasion threshold model cannot possibly apply after dynamical equilibrium has been reached, because there is no reservoir of immune or resistant hosts to be exploited by a mutant parasite.",

The optimum was predicted when assuming a linear trade-off between lysis time and number of progeny at lysis and that the linearity extended well beyond the normal lysis time. Adaptation of phage T7 was performed under constant environmental conditions of both high and low host density; this constant host density provided for a fixed optimum and matches the models in this paper. At high host density, T7 attained a lysis time close to the optimum within 150 generations of adaptation, but the phage failed to approach the optimum at low host density in two separate adaptations of $300 generations each. One failure stemmed from a lack of evolution, likely because of small population size. In the other case, molecular evolution was observed, and the failure to attain the optimum was interpreted as a failure of the model used to calculate the optimum (that the assumed trade-off did not match the T7 trade-off). The failure to evolve is a special case of our nonequilibrium model, and presumably, the virus would have evolved after sufficient time. The failure to attain the optimum despite evolution in the other replicate is presumably a failure to calculate the true optimum, and thus not an illustration of nonequilibrium dynamics, unless it could be shown that the predicted equilibrium would eventually be obtained given sufficient time. Overall, this experimental study illustrates how the measurement of deviation from optimality reflects on the nonequilibrium model, but only when the basis for nonoptimality is understood.",

In addition, the virulence of measles is notoriously sensitive to host nutritional status, so it is not clear what level of virulence to apply to the model.

The other class consists of H types introduced from other species (a process of 'antigenic shift'). Flu virus with novel H types have a profound advantage because there is no prevailing immunity in humans against those types. Three world-wide flu pandemics of the 1900s were notorious for causing large numbers of infections and thus large numbers of deaths; all were due to viruses that had acquired H types that humans had not previously experienced. Not all viruses with novel H types readily spread in humans, however, and many of these introductions have simply died out.

The virulence of this strain appeared to wane over a few years. H1N1 disappeared in the 1950s, and its accidental reintroduction in 1977 to naive hosts did not lead to the high mortality rate of 1918, so it appears that the virulence per se evolved downward (Kilbourne 2006) . Although mortality rates of the usual antigenic shift strains remain relatively constant, some high virulence exceptions are known (e.g., an H3N2 strain from 1997; O'Donnell et al. 2003) , and there may well be many low-virulence variants that go unnoticed.

Live vaccines have been used for three decades, the virus used in them having been changed twice.

It may well be that vaccines have selected escape mutants time and again. Whether escape mutants retained near-optimal virulence or not is difficult to establish, because there is a strong ascertainment bias -avirulent viruses are not noticed by chicken farmers. Thus, without understanding the range of virulence levels that have evolved, it is not practical to discriminate among the models. Such a system seems ripe for testing the models, however.",

Recommendations for use of this perspective are thus accordingly muted. Certainly, it seems wise in virulence management efforts to be aware that a broader range of virulence might invade than is optimal and that evolution to an optimum may not be rapid. It would be obvious folly to ignore a case in which the predicted optimum was low virulence but in which a highly virulent parasite could invade and persist. If the perspective offered here proves to be broadly relevant, then its impact is to support and even bolster any concerns about the evolution of high virulence but also to raise the specter of temporary high virulence in parasites expected to equilibrate at low virulence.",

Calculating virulence optima has not met with much success, however, likely because the optimum invariably depends on an unknown trade-off and potentially on many environmental factors. Thus, most tests of virulence evolution models have been relative, i.e., correlating virulence level with some environmental characteristic and determining if the correlation is in the right direction. Direct, quantitative tests of virulence optima are rare, nonexistent for human pathogens. If optima cannot be calculated, then it is of course difficult to test any nonequilibrium model against an optimality model. But an alternative to testing whether virulence is optimal is to observe the dynamics of virulence evolution. If virulence does not change over long periods after invasion, despite a dropping susceptible host density, then it would seem that virulence has been nonoptimal during much of the time.",
