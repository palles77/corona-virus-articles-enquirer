[1] [2] [3] The majority of the earliest cases were epidemiologically traced to the local Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market, where some wild animals were sold. [1] [2] [3] [4] On Jan 26, novel coronavirus was detected in environmental samples from this market by China CDC, suggesting that the virus possibly originated in wild animals sold in the market. [3] [4] This pathogenic virus has been identified as a new strain of coronavirus, which is in the same family as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). [4] [5] The COVID-19 outbreak was declared by World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on Jan 30, 2020. 6 As of Feb 16, 2020, a total of 70,548 cases have been reported in mainland China, with 1,770 resulting deaths. 7 The outbreak has now spread beyond China to twenty-five other countries. 8 The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were proven to have originated from wild animals. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The COVID-19 is also likely to have a zoonotic origin. The practice of consuming wild animal products in China dates back to prehistoric times and persists into today. 9 Trade and consumption of wild animals were not well regulated even after SARS. Until the amendment of Wild Animal Protection Act in 2016, the prohibition was firstly added, but only for a short list of the nationally protected animals. Previous studies explored population exposure to live poultry in China, [15] [16] [17] but information on exposure to wild animals is limited.",

Secondly, live animal transactions should be more strictly regulated, and wild animal transactions should be even prohibited in the long term.

We aimed to identify behavioral changes in a cross-sectional survey, and outcomes before the outbreak were measured based on participant recall. Second, our results may be affected by selection bias from telephone survey. We did attempt multiple calls to unanswered numbers to mitigate this bias, and quota sampling was introduced to get a representative sample. The anonymous phone interview addressed the concern of response bias due to fear of being seen as criticizing the government. Third, a cross-sectional design prevents us from assessing how long the effect on behavioral/intention change demonstrated in this study will last, when the outbreak is no longer fresh in people's minds. Thus, we plan to conduct a second-round survey at the end of the outbreak to track the long-term changes.",
