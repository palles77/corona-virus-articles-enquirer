Suspected cases of these conditions should be referred to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as soon as possible and hopefully before postmortem examination. Local medical examiners or offices and public health laboratories may provide guidance. 3 The CDC, in association with other federal, state, and local agencies, has designated regional laboratories (Laboratory Response Network) to aid in the diagnosis and containment of lethal transmissible conditions. 4, 5 ",

In situ photographs obviate the additional risk of moving fresh tissue around the room. Photography of fixed specimens is cleaner and, in this respect, preferable, especially when an infective agent is known to be present. Whether the specimen is fresh or fixed, a pan is used for cleanliness during transport of the organ to the photographic stand. The camera should be handled with clean gloves or by a second person who stays clean. After photographs have been taken, the photostand should be cleaned with disinfectant. Cameras, lenses, and other photographic equipment may be disinfected with a variety of germicidal substances without compromising their functionality. 11 A hands-free camera system would also reduce contamination risk. disposable aprons, caps, N95 particulate masks, eye protection (goggles or face shields), shoe covers or footwear restricted to contaminated areas, and double sets of gloves. Cut-resistant and puncture-resistant hand protection (plastic or steel gloves) is also available and certainly recommended for high-risk procedures. A retrospective study has demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing injuries. 9 Use of Sharp Instruments One should exercise extraordinary care to minimize the risk of injury from sharp instruments and needles. Whenever possible, the use of needles should be avoided. Needlestick injuries occurring during routine autopsy procedures are entirely preventable; blunt needles and bulb syringes should be used to aspirate fluids in most situations. Because many needlestick accidents occur during disposal of needles, needles should never be recapped after use. Needles and other sharps should be disposed of directly into the approved receptacle; they should not be left lying around the work area.",

The frequency of hand injuries sustained while performing autopsy procedures can be reduced by several simple practices (Box 3-2). A pair of scissors can adequately substitute for a scalpel during most autopsy procedures, including evisceration. The use of blunt-tipped, rather than pointed, scissors for almost all autopsy tissue dissection is advisable. When dissecting with a sharp implement in one hand, one should apply countertraction on tissues by using a long-handled tissue forceps held in the opposite hand; do not hold tissues with the fingers of the noncutting hand. For high-risk cases or dissections, steel-link gloves or some other scalpel-resistant material can be used. Plastic or Kevlar cut-resistant gloves provide protection while still allowing relative dexterity, and we encourage their use whenever possible.",

For protection against diseases transmissible by aerosols, such as tuberculosis, N95 particulate masks (masks able to filter 1-\u00b5m particles in the unloaded state with a filter efficiency of 95%, given flow rates up to 50 L/min) or containment hoods or suits equipped with powered, airpurifying respirators with HEPA filters are used. Collecting body cavity fluids with a ladle or bulb syringe generates less aerosol than a hose aspirator connected to a sink faucet. Placing plastic bags over the head of the decedent during removal of the calvarium with a Stryker saw or saws equipped with HEPA filters within the vacuum system can also reduce the amount of aerosolization.

Nonetheless, the sensitivity of individuals is highly variable. Exposure studies performed in rats have shown that formaldehyde may induce nasal squamous cell carcinomas 27, 28 ; however, implications for humans are equivocal. Studies relating the rat and human data indicate that the carcinogenic risk for humans at relevant levels of formaldehyde exposure is minimal; further, it is likely that precautions effective against noncarcinogenic toxic effects of the chemical are sufficient to protect against its carcinogenic effects. 29 The autopsy suite should have sufficient ventilation and effective chemical fume hoods to reduce employee exposure to formaldehyde vapor. As mandated by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), employers must monitor formaldehyde levels in the workplace and maintain employee exposures below the legal safe limits. Institutions should provide a mandatory training program for all employees exposed to formaldehyde at or above 0.1 ppm on an 8-hour time-weighted average.

Although shocks of this magnitude are unlikely to cause death, manufacturers recommend that the ICDs be deactivated before manipulation and that high-quality latex surgical gloves be used when handling the devices. Double gloving, with two layers of surgical gloves, provides more protection against shock and is recommended for autopsies with ICDs. 34 In many cases, the autopsy prosector is aware of the presence of an ICD after review of the medical history of the deceased. Before the autopsy, cardiology personnel at most medical facilities can be asked to interrogate the device for antemortem information, deactivate it, and provide instructions regarding its proper disposition. At our institution, there is a \"device nurse\" on call for such issues. However, medicine examinations are usually not a radiation hazard.

In consultation with the specialist, the amount of activity remaining in the body should be estimated by reference to the half-life of the isotope. If the remaining amount is less than 5 mCi, no special precautions are necessary, other than the usual wearing of gloves. An exception is cases of 131 I therapy or therapy with insoluble radioisotopes, in which specific tissues (e.g., thyroid) or body cavities contain most of the activity.",

Biventricular pacemakers are also relatively large, so size alone cannot distinguish an ICD from pacemaker. The outside of the metal case usually has the manufacturer and model information etched into the surface, which can lead to helpful information with a quick Internet search. If an ICD is present, the pathologist should discontinue the postmortem examination until the device is properly deactivated (Box 3-8) . Because ICDs may explode if incinerated, they should never be discarded without special attention, and the disposition should be guided by either cardiology personnel or the manufacturer. ",

In either case, the resulting deformation can produce sharp edges in shrapnel that present a risk for injury to those who remove or handle it. For autopsies of gunshot victims, Russell and co-workers 35 recommended that anteroposterior and lateral radiographs be taken to locate bullets, bullet fragments, and any sharp or irregular edges. Bullets should be handled only by personnel wearing double heavy-duty gloves. To prevent marring of the projectile surface, a rubber-tipped bullet extractor fashioned from a Kelly forceps fitted with 2 cm of rubber catheter over its ends or a plastic forceps should be used to recover bullets and bullet fragments. After collection of any trace evidence on the projectile itself, the bullet should be gently rinsed to remove contaminating blood or body fluids to decrease its subsequent infective risk. Finally, the bullet or bullet fragments should be double packed in leakproof packaging with at least one of the containers composed of hard plastic to prevent injury during subsequent handling. In addition to the appropriate identifying information, the container should be labeled with a biohazard sticker.",

Embolized needle foreign bodies have been discovered in soft tissues of the neck and even within internal organs.
