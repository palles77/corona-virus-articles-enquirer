Cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus, Culex flavivirus and several recently discovered flaviviruses have no known vertebrate host and apparently infect only insects. We present compelling bioinformatic evidence for a 253-295 codon overlapping gene (designated fifo) conserved throughout these insect-specific flaviviruses and immunofluorescent detection of its product. Fifo overlaps the NS2A/NS2B coding sequence in the \u2212 1/+ 2 reading frame and is most likely expressed as a trans-frame fusion protein via ribosomal frameshifting at a conserved GGAUUUY slippery heptanucleotide with 3\u2032-adjacent RNA secondary structure (which stimulates efficient frameshifting in vitro). The discovery bears striking parallels to the recently discovered ribosomal frameshifting site in the NS2A coding sequence of the Japanese encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses and suggests that programmed ribosomal frameshifting may be more widespread in flaviviruses than currently realized.",

The positive-sense, single-stranded genomic RNA is \u223c11 kb in length and contains a long open reading frame, which is translated as a polyprotein and cleaved by virus-encoded and host proteases to produce \u223c10 mature proteins. While the majority of flaviviruses are transmitted from one vertebrate host to another by hematophagous arthropod vectors, a number of flaviviruses are apparently insect-specific. Such flaviviruses include cell fusing agent virus (CFAV; Cammisa-Parks et al., 1992; Cook et al., 2006 Cook et al., , 2009 Stollar and Thomas, 1975) , Kamiti River virus (KRV; Crabtree et al., 2003; Sang et al., 2003) , Culex flavivirus (CxFV; Blitvich et al., 2009; Cook et al., 2009; Farfan-Ale et al., 2009; Hoshino et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2009; Morales-Betoulle et al., 2008) , Quang Binh virus (QBV; Crabtree et al., 2009) , Aedes flavivirus (AEFV; Hoshino et al., 2009) and Nakiwogo virus (NAKV; Cook et al., 2009 ). In addition, flavivirus-like sequences have been found integrated into mosquito genomes (e.g., cell silent agent or CSA; Crochu et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Many viruses harbour sequences that induce a portion of ribosomes to shift \u2212 1 nt and continue translating in the new reading frame (Brierley and Pennell, 2001) . The eukaryotic \u22121 frameshift site typically consists of a 'slippery' heptanucleotide fitting the consensus motif N NNW WWH, where NNN represents any three identical nucleotides, WWW represents AAA or UUU, H represents A, C or U, and spaces separate zero-frame codons. This is followed by a 'spacer' region of 5-9 nt and then a stable RNA secondary structure such as a pseudoknot or hairpin. Recently, we identified a ribosomal frameshift site in the JEV serogroup of flaviviruses (Balmori Melian et al., 2009; Firth and Atkins, 2009 ) that gives rise to the NS1\u2032 protein, whose origin had previously been an unsolved enigma. In the JEV serogroup, frameshifting takes place just 8 codons into the NS2A coding sequence at a highly conserved Y CCU UUU slippery site (where Y represents U or C; G:U anticodon:codon re-pairing occurs at position 1 of the heptanucleotide when Y is U), while a very stable 3\u2032-adjacent RNA pseudoknot provides an additional, and in this case essential, stimulatory element. The frameshifting efficiency in virus-infected cells is estimated to be \u223c20-50%. Ribosomes that frameshift translate a 45-codon ORF (termed foo, for Flavivirus Overlapping ORF) in the \u22121/+2 frame relative to the polyprotein coding sequence before terminating. This produces a 52 amino acid NS2A N-term -FOO transframe fusion peptide that, in contrast to zero-frame NS2A, fails to mediate cleavage at the NS1|NS2A boundary. Thus, the mature protein product is NS1-NS2A N-term -FOO (i.e., a 52 amino acid extension of NS1) which equates to the previously identified NS1\u2032 protein (Balmori Melian et al., 2009; Blitvich et al., 1999) .",

Fifo contains nearly 300 codons and detailed bioinformatic analysis provides overwhelming evidence that it is indeed a coding sequence, most likely translated as a trans-frame fusion via programmed ribosomal frameshifting.

In the CxFV Tokyo strain (GenBank ID: AB262759), the polyprotein coding sequence encompasses nucleotides 92-10183 and the maximal (i.e., stop codon to stop codon) coordinates for the fifo ORF are 3328-4290, giving rise to a 321-codon ORF in the +2 frame relative to the polyprotein coding sequence. The entire polyprotein coding sequence of AB262759 has 162 stop codons in the +2 frame out of a total of 3363 codons so, on average, a 321-codon region in the + 2 frame would be expected to contain 15.5 stop codons. Thus, the probability of obtaining an uninterrupted 321-codon +2 frame ORF simply by chance is extremely small. Indeed, if +2 frame stop codons within the polyprotein coding sequence are assumed to be randomly distributed, then the probability is of order p \u223c 2 \u00d7 10 -5 . To guard against the possibility that the absence of stop codons in the +2 frame could be due to an unusual amino acid composition in the NS2A/NS2B region of the polyprotein (e.g., these proteins are particularly hydrophobic), we used a simplified (i.e., single-sequence) version of the CCRT statistic of Chung et al. (2007) , as follows. A codon usage table for AB262759 was calculated using the entire polyprotein coding sequence. Then zero-frame codons in the fifo region were replaced with codons drawn randomly according to the frequencies in the codon usage table, while maintaining the zero-frame amino acid sequence. This randomization procedure was repeated 10,000 times, and the number of +2 frame stop codons (in the fifo region) was counted for each randomization. Only 0.02% of the randomized sequences had an uninterrupted + 2 frame ORF, and the mean number of + 2 frame stop codons was 8.3. Thus, although the amino acid composition of the NS2A/NS2B proteins does favour a reduction in the number of +2 frame stop codons (8.3 expected, compared with 15.5 expected if whole-polyprotein frequencies are assumed), the reduction is not enough to explain the presence of such a long + 2 frame ORF as a chance event.",

The polyprotein coding sequences from QBV and six CxFV isolates were extracted, translated, aligned with CLUSTALW (Larkin et al., 2007) , and back-translated to a nucleotide sequence alignment. Beginning with pairwise sequence comparisons, conservation at synonymous sites (only) was evaluated by comparing the observed number of base substitutions with the number expected under a neutral evolution model. The procedure takes into account whether synonymous site codons are 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-or 6-fold degenerate and the differing probabilities of transitions and transversions. Statistics were then summed over a phylogenetic tree as described in Firth and Brown (2006) , and averaged over a sliding window. The analysis revealed a striking, and highly statistically significant (p \u223c 4 \u00d7 10 -16 for the total conservation within the whole fifo ORF), peak in polyprotein-frame synonymous site conservation in a region corresponding precisely to the conserved open reading frame, fifo (Fig. 2 , panels 5-8). Peaks in synonymous site conservation are generally indicative of functionally important overlapping elements. Although, in general, such elements may be either coding or noncoding, the extent (\u223c300 codons) and degree (Fig. 2, panel 6 ) of the conservation here would be unusual for a non-coding element.",

            "text": "One other explanation for extended conservation could be recombination (though apparently relatively rare in the flaviviruses; Simmonds, 2006; Taucher et al., 2010) . However, recombination is expected to suppress the observed frequency of non-synonymous substitutions at least as much as the observed frequency of synonymous substitutions whereas the opposite effect is observed in this case. For example, in a comparison between QBV FJ644291 and CxFV AB262759, the relative frequencies of identical, distinct but synonymous, and non-synonymous polyprotein-frame aligned codon pairs were 36\u00b1 3%, 27 \u00b1 3% and 37 \u00b1 4% within the fifo region, and 28 \u00b1 1%, 40 \u00b1 1% and 32 \u00b1 1% outside of the fifo region. (The observed frequencies are, of course, exact numbers. The 'error' rangesbased on simple Poisson statisticsare simply for assessing the statistical significance of the observed differences.) Thus, although the frequency of polyprotein-frame synonymous substitutions is greatly reduced within the fifo region (27 \u00b1 3% compared with 40\u00b1 1% outside of fifo), the frequency of non-synonymous substitutions is in fact slightly increased (37 \u00b1 4% compared with 32 \u00b1 1% outside of fifo). Similarly, application of a variety of recombination-detection programs from the RDP2 package (Martin et al., 2005) failed to identify potential recombination in this region of the genome. Finally, recombination Fig. 2 . Conservation at synonymous sites in CxFV and QBV. Conservation was calculated for an input alignment comprising the polyprotein coding sequences from the CxFV sequences AB262759, AB377213, FJ663034, FJ502995, GQ165808 and EU879060, and the QBV sequence FJ644291. Panel 1 shows a map of the CxFV genome, along with the proposed overlapping gene fifo and the proposed frameshift site. Panels 2-4 show the positions of stop codons in the three forward reading frames. The + 0 frame is the polyprotein frame and is therefore devoid of stop codons. Note the conserved absence of stop codons in the \u2212 1/+ 2 frame within the fifo ORF. Panels 5-8 depict the conservation at polyprotein-frame synonymous sites. Panels 5 and 7 depict the probability that the degree of conservation within a given window could be obtained under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites, while panels 6 and 8 depict the absolute amount of conservation as represented by the ratio of the observed number of substitutions within a given window to the number expected under the null model (see Firth and Atkins, 2009, for details) . Note that the large sliding window size (75 codons) is responsible for the broad smoothing of the conservation scores at either end of the fifo ORF. The range of features detected by this type of analysis depends partly on the sliding window size \u2212 75 codons is optimal for features with a width of 75 codons. If features cover fewer codons (e.g., many non-coding functional elements), then the corresponding conservation peaks may be diluted to such an extent that they are not distinguishable from background noise.",

            "text": "We next inspected the sequences for a potential translation mechanism. It is unlikely that independent initiation (e.g., via an internal ribosome entry site or shunting mechanism) occurs since there is no positionally conserved AUG codon in the CxFV/QBV alignment, and some sequences have no AUG codon until 119 codons into the ORF. However, near the 5\u2032 end of the fifo ORFs of both CxFV and QBV we found a conserved slippery heptanucleotide motif G GAU UUC (spaces separate polyprotein or zero-frame codons). The slippery site was followed by a 7-nt spacer and then a large RNA hairpin structure containing one unpaired residue and, in CxFV, a 1-bp symmetric bulge (Fig. 3) . The hairpin structure was essentially conserved in CxFV and QBValbeit with some minor differences near the apex, and some G:C to G:U or A:U to G:U substitutions in the stem that preserved the base pairings. Allowing for G:U codon: anticodon re-pairing at position 2 of the heptanucleotide, the combination of the G GAU UUC heptanucleotide and the 3\u2032-adjacent RNA hairpin structure fit the consensus motif for \u2212 1 ribosomal frameshifting. In fact G GAU UUH is a recognized shifty site. Frameshifting in Red clover necrotic mosaic virus and other dianthoviruses, besides certain umbraviruses, occurs at G GAU UUU (Bekaert and Rousset, 2005; Gibbs et al., 1996; Kim and Lommel, 1994) . Brierley et al. (1992) measured an in vitro frameshifting efficiency of 15.5% for G GAU UUA in the context of a 'minimal' infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) based 3\u2032-adjacent pseudoknot, compared with 16.1% for G GGU UUA in the same context. Thus, all other things being equal, G GAU UUH may be expected to stimulate frameshifting as efficiently as G GGU UUH. Brierley et al. (1992) measured frameshifting efficiencies of 38.3% and 15.8%, respectively, for G GGU UUU and G GGU UUC. Although there is no reason to expect that these values (measured in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and in the context of the minimal IBV-based 3\u2032-adjacent pseudoknot) are representative of values in insect cells infected with insect-specific flaviviruses, it nonetheless seems reasonable to suppose that frameshifting at this site has the potential to be highly efficient. Moreover, the functional importance of the G GAU UUC motif in CxFV and QBV is supported by the conservation of 'G' at position one, despite the corresponding polyprotein-frame codon encoding different amino acids in the two viruses (ccG/proline in CxFV; caG/ glutamine in QBV). Frameshifting at this location would result in the translation of a 295-codon (CxFV) or 292-codon (QBV) \u22121/+2 frame ORF (see Fig. 4 for an amino acid alignment), fused to the N-terminal region of NS2A.",

The most likely slippery site appears to be the nucleotides G UUU UUU, which align with the slippery heptanucleotide sequence in the CxFV and QBV genomes (Fig. 3B ).

Similar to CxFV and QBV, the slippery heptanucleotide was G GAU UUY (Y represents U or C) but, instead of a 3\u2032-adjacent potential stem-loop structure, there was a 3\u2032-adjacent potential pseudoknot (Fig. 3) . Support for the functionality of the G GAU UUY motif comes from the presence of both ucG (serine; 6-fold degenerate) and gcG (alanine; 4-fold degenerate) codons that preserve the 'G' at position one of the heptanucleotide, even though the polyprotein-frame amino acid is not conserved, while support for the pseudoknot comes from a number of A:U to G:U and G:C to G:U substitutions, besides one C:G to A:U paired substitution (between the two strains of CFAV) that preserve the predicted base pairings. Frameshifting at the G GAU UUY motif would result in translation of a 259-codon fifo ORF in KRV, AEFV and CFAV-RioPiedras02 (Fig. 5 ).",

            "text": "There are currently two distinct CFAV sequences in GenBank with NS2A coverage. One isolate (CFAV-Rio Piedras02) was obtained from wild-caught mosquitoes , while the other isolate (herein referred to as CFAV-1993) was obtained from a laboratory mosquito cell line (Cammisa-Parks et al., 1992) . CFAV-RioPiedras02 contains the proposed frameshift site, including the 3\u2032-adjacent pseudoknot, and the 259-codon fifo ORF (Figs. 3, 5) . In CFAV-1993, however, the fifo ORF is disrupted by three premature termination codons (Fig. 5) . We propose that propagation in cell culture has resulted in the loss of FIFO in CFAV-1993. Nonetheless, the historic relic of a 259-codon fifo ORF is clearly visible in the CFAV-1993 sequence: the frameshift slippery site and 3\u2032-adjacent pseudoknot are still present, and the region has very few +2 frame stop codons (3 out of 259 codons, compared with 190 out of 3341 for the full polyprotein coding sequence which equates to a mean of 14.7 for a 259-codon region; Figs. 3, 5). Frameshifting likely still occurs but would produce a truncated trans-frame protein lacking nearly 90% of FIFO. Although the occurrence of frameshifting may, in itself, be advantageous for the virus irrespective of whether or not the full FIFO protein is produced (see The evolution of FIFO and implications for frameshifting in other flaviviruses), the apparent viability of CFAV-1993 indicates that the full-length FIFO protein is non-essential for replication in cell culture. It is interesting to note that JEV-serogroup NS1\u2032 is also non-essential for replicationat least for West Nile virus (subtype Kunjin virus)although abolishing NS1\u2032 attenuates the virus (Balmori Melian et al., 2009) . Nonetheless, the fact that the fifo ORF is so widely conserved in wild-type insect-specific flaviviruses suggests that it plays an important role in nature.",

The consequences, if any, of chromosome-integrated flavivirus sequences for the host and/or for subsequent viral infection are not known. However, it cannot be assumed that selection on CSA will operate to preserve the coding potential of the fifo ORF. On the other hand, if chromosome integration was a relatively recent event, then the coding signature of the fifo ORF prior to integration may remain relatively intact since substitutions in chromosomal sequences occur at a much slower rate than in RNA virus genomes. Indeed, estimates of the time to the most recent common ancestor of CSA and CFAV and the divergence rate of Aedes species (Crochu et al., 2004) suggest that the expected total number of nucleotide substitutions within the fifo ORF since CSA integration is likely to be zero. Moreover, analysis of the CSA sequence, GenBank ID: AF411835, revealed that the fifo ORF is present and contains an apparently intact ribosomal frameshift site at its 5\u2032 end, allowing access to a 253-codon fifo ORF (Figs. 3 and 5) .",

This indicates that the C-terminal half of FIFO is subject to stronger functional constraints than the N-terminal half. One possible reason why the conservation score in the 5\u2032 half of fifo is much less significant in this alignment (Fig. 6 ) than the CxFV/QBV alignment (Fig. 2 ) may simply be that the CxFV/QBV alignment includes a number of closely related sequences (the six CxFV strains) while the CFAV/KRV/AEFV/CSA alignment includes only highly divergent sequences.",

Within the Flavivirus genus, FIFO has a restricted phylogenetic distribution and presumably evolved more recently than NS2A/NS2B, via the process of 'overprinting' of the preexisting NS2A/NS2B coding sequence (Keese and Gibbs, 1992) . Such 'de novo' proteins often have 'non-essential' or 'secondary' functions. Thus, it is not surprising that FIFO is subject to weaker functional constraints (as reflected by lower amino acid conservation) than NS2A/NS2B. In this case, it seems that the particular nature of the FIFO protein is compatible with a substantial degree of amino acid variation. In fact, de novo proteins encoded by overlapping genes often assume particular characteristicsperhaps as a result of their evolutionary origin enforcing an 'unusual' amino acid composition and/or evolutionary competition from the overlapping ancestral genethat are compatible with a high degree of evolutionary flexibility in their amino acid sequences (Rancurel et al., 2009) .

Previous work has demonstrated that, at least in DENV, efficient NS1|NS2A cleavage requires translation of substantial parts of NS2A (Falgout et al., 1989; Falgout and Markoff, 1995; Leblois and Young, 1995) . Although the exact mechanism has not been defined, it has been proposed that the presence of NS2A results in a conformation that presents the NS1| NS2A cleavage site to an endoplasmic reticulum-resident host protease (Falgout and Markoff, 1995) . When frameshifting occurs in the JEV-serogroup flaviviruses, it appears that the 52 amino acid NS2A N-term -FOO fusion is insufficient to mediate NS1|NS2A cleavage, resulting in the NS1-NS2A N-term -FOO product known as NS1\u2032 (Balmori Melian et al., 2009; Firth and Atkins, 2009) . This mechanism appears to function in both insect and vertebrate cells as NS1\u2032 is produced in both (Balmori Melian et al., 2009) . At this stage, it is unclear whether or not NS1|NS2A cleavage in the insect-specific flaviviruses requires the synthesis of NS2A. If NS1|NS2A cleavage does require NS2A synthesis, then it is unknown whether or not NS2A N-term -FIFO synthesis will substitute. Thus, FIFO may be produced as a NS1-NS2A N-term -FIFO fusion or as a NS2A N-term -FIFO fusion or perhaps in both forms. Moreover, the two predicted transmembrane domains in Clade 1 may allow a suitable topology for further signalase cleavage within FIFO itself (potential cleavage sites were identified with SignalP 3.0 [Bendtsen et al., 2004] , though it remains to be seen whether they are actually utilized). AY149905 and AY149904 are nearly identical. Only AY149905, AB488408, AF411835 and GQ165810 were used to calculate the synonymous site conservation statistics (panels 5-6). There is considerable variation in the 3\u2032 UTR lengths between the different sequences (e.g., 559, 1208 and 945 nt, respectively, in CFAV M91671, KRV AY149905 and AEFV AB488408; see Gritsun and Gould, 2006 , for a discussion)hence the wiggly line in the genome diagram. The CFAV-1993 sequence (isolated from a laboratory mosquito cell line) has lost the fifo ORF, indicating that the product is non-essential in cell culture.",

If the published predictions (summarized in Hoshino et al., 2009 ) are correct, then it is interesting to note that the location of the frameshift site relative to the cleavage site differs substantially between the two insect-specific flavivirus clades (NS2A codons 28 and 29 in CxFV, but NS2A codons 3 and 4 in CFAV, KRV and AEFV). However, it is possible that NS1|NS2A cleavage in CxFV occurs at an alternative site 24 codons downstream, so that the frameshift site would be at NS2A codons 4 and 5 in CxFV. In favour of this new site, the \u22123 and \u22121 amino acids are V and G in CxFV and A and A in QBV, while the old site has \u22123 and \u22121 amino acids I and A in CxFV and I and N in QBV; thus, the new site appears to be more consistent with the '-1, -3' rule for signalase cleavage.",

Similar findings were observed in IFAs performed using paraformaldehyde-fixed cells (data not shown).

This is similar to the predicted size of NS2A N-term -FIFO (i.e., \u223c34 kDa in the absence of posttranslational modification). However, this product was not consistently observed with these lysates and nor was it detected in Western blots performed with FIFO Ab 2 and lysates from CxFV-Iowa07infected cells. Thus, it is not clear whether the \u223c38 kDa band is a nonspecific artifact or if FIFO is not readily detected by western blot due to the relatively low frameshifting efficiency estimated for CxFV (\u223c6%; see Analysis of the proposed site of frameshifting).",

The possibility that the 5\u2032terminal regions of the downstream vector sequence might be interfering with the predicted frameshift-stimulatory hairpin structure in CxFV by forming competing RNA structures was investigated by folding WT CxFV sequence, and CxFV sequence in the vector context, with pknotsRG (Reeder et al., 2007) .

The overall 3-fold reduction was apparently not due to the different vector since translation of the inserts in the insect vector in rabbit reticulocyte lysate produced similar values (Fig. 8B ). It is also not a temperature effect since all experiments were performed at the same temperature (30\u00b0C).

The most promising candidates were found in the genomes of four poorly characterized flaviviruses: Nounane virus (NOUV), Lammi virus (LAMV), Kedougou virus (KEDV) and Chaoyang virus. The genome of NOUV (GenBank ID: FJ711167; Junglen et al., 2009 ) contains a U UUU UUA slippery site followed by a 5 nt spacer and a potential 13 bp hairpin structure (Fig. 9A ) 24-25 codons upstream of the NS2A/NS2B predicted cleavage site. The motif is curiously similar to the experimentally confirmed frameshift cassette in sleeping disease alphavirus B.Y. Chung et al, manuscript in preparation) which also has a U UUU UUA slippery site and a 3\u2032-adjacent 13 bp hairpin structure. Moreover, the five nucleotides immediately following the U UUU UUA motif (viz. GGGGU) are identical between the two viruses. In NOUV, the out-of-frame ORF has just 2 codons and frameshifting at this location would result in a truncated form of NS2A. The KEDV genome (GenBank ID: AY632540; Kuno and Chang, 2005) contains a U UUU UUA slippery site followed by a 5 nt spacer and a stable potential pseudoknot (though, perhaps unusually for frameshiftstimulating structures, the second loop region of the pseudoknot has N1 nt; Fig. 9B ; Brierley and Pennell, 2001) . The slippery site is located 52-53 codons downstream of the NS2A/NS2B predicted cleavage site, and the out-of-frame ORF has 21 codons. The Chaoyang virus genome (GenBank ID: FJ883471) contains a G GAU UUU slippery site followed by a 7 nt spacer and a potential 10 bp hairpin structure (Fig. 9C ) 83-84 codons downstream of the NS2A/NS2B predicted cleavage site. Here, the out-of-frame ORF has 107 codons and frameshifting at this location would result in an elongated version of NS2B. An homologous site is also present in the LAMV genome (GenBank ID: FJ606789; Huhtamo et al., 2009) . Here, the shift site and out-of-frame ORF lengths are identical to those in Chaoyang virus, and the hairpinalthough 1 bp shorteris supported by an A:U to G:C substitution that preserves the base pairing (Fig. 9C) .

Even if frameshifting does occur (as indicated by the reporter assays), it may be accidental rather than functionally important and subject to purifying selection. Thus, the key to identifying biologically relevant frameshift sites from sequence analysis alone is the phylogenetic conservation of potential frameshift-stimulatory elements over a significantly divergent alignment. This is particularly true if the out-of-frame ORF is too short to obtain Fig. 8 . SDS PAGEs for frameshifting assays. (A) Translation of products from pF25A constructs in the insect cell-free system. The frameshifting cassette was fused between upstream and downstream ORFs such that translation of the downstream ORFas a fusion with the upstream ORFoccurs only if frameshifting occurs. The predicted sizes of the termination product (upstream ORF, no frameshifting) and frameshift product (fusion of both ORFs) are marked. Frameshifting efficiencies were calculated from the intensities of labelled bands after normalization for the number of methionine residues in each product. WT sequence (especially CFAV) stimulates high levels of frameshifting, while frameshifting is reduced to background levels in the frameshift (fs) site knockout mutants. Unfortunately background bands (first lane) at the same positions as both the termination and frameshift products makes precise measurement difficult for the shift site mutants, although it is clear that frameshifting is greatly diminished in the mutants. (B) Comparison of frameshifting efficiencies between the insect system (I) and rabbit reticulocyte lysate (R). Both vectors pF25A and pDluc were tested in rabbit reticulocyte lysate but only the insect-optimized pF25A vector was usable in the insect system. an independent measure of its 'coding potential'. However, without more sequence data for these and/or closely related species for comparative sequence analysis, and in the absence of experimental evidence for function in virus-infected cells, it is not clear at present whether or not the NOUV, LAMV, KEDV and Chaoyang virus candidate frameshift sites have any biological significance.

            "text": "The discovery of fifo raises a number of interesting evolutionary questions. Does FIFO have similar or different functions in the two insect-specific flavivirus clades? Although the frameshift site and at least some of the fifo ORF was presumably present in the ancestral virus, was the full fifo ORF also present in the ancestral virus or did it evolve through two independent elongation events? Was frameshifting at the 5\u2032 end of the NS2A coding sequence present in the last common ancestor of both the JEV-serogroup of flaviviruses and the insect-specific flaviviruses? If so, then it was surely also present in the ancestor of DENV, even though it has now apparently been lost in DENV and many other flaviviruses (transfer of the frameshift cassette via recombination, after the divergence of the JEV-serogroup from DENV, appears highly unlikely since in this genomic region, as elsewhere, JEV is much more similar to DENV than to CxFV or CFAV). If not then, given the general rarity of programmed ribosomal frameshifting, what selective forces drove the evolution on two separate occasions of frameshifting in this particular region of the flavivirus genome? Some possible such selective forces may be (i) to produce an alternative version of NS1 with a distinct C-terminal extension; (ii) to produce an NS1-like protein, viz. NS1\u2032, that is not Cterminally linked to the downstream polyprotein (perhaps as a mechanism to modulate the post-translational processing pathway for a portion of NS1); (iii) to act as a 'ribosome sink', i.e., to reduce the quantity of ribosomes translating the downstream polyprotein products; and (iv) as part of a regulatory mechanism (especially if the frameshifting efficiency is temporally modulated, e.g., by the buildup of a viral protein or by changing cellular conditions; cf. Goff, 2004; Baranov et al., 2002) . In scenarios (ii)-(iv), the initial selective force would simply be to have a frameshift site, with the actual amino acid sequence encoded by the out-of-frame ORF being essentially irrelevant. This could then have been co-opted as a suitable site to begin the Fig. 9 . Potential slippery heptanucleotides and stimulatory RNA secondary structures for \u2212 1 ribosomal frameshifting in Nounane virus, Kedougou virus, Chaoyang virus and Lammi virus. In contrast to the insect-specific flavivirus fifo frameshift site, these cases are merely candidate frameshift sites and currently have either no (Nounane, Kedougou) or only very modest (Chaoyang, Lammi) phylogenetic support.

Lane 1 shows translation products for an in-frame control (IFC)in which an extra nucleotide has been inserted next to the slippery heptanucleotide to put both ORFs into the same reading frameto show the expected size of the frameshift fusion product. Note that the faint band corresponding to the frameshift product for the CFAV and CxFV frameshift site (fs) mutants may represent a background of low-level slippage occurring anywhere within the overlap region between the upstream and downstream ORFs and does not necessarily represent slippage just at the mutated shift site. evolution of an overlapping gene via incremental elongation by substitutions of intervening \u22121/+2 frame stop codons with sense codons and selection on the encoded amino acid sequence (cf.

Since the flavivirus structural proteins are encoded by the 5\u2032 end of the polyprotein coding sequence, and since only a fraction (\u223c5% or fewer) of the translated non-structural proteins that comprise the components of the viral replication complex and, in particular, the viral polymerase or RdRp (NS5 in the flaviviruses) appear to be actually utilized for replication (Ahlquist, 2006; Quinkert et al., 2005; Uchil and Satchidanandam, 2003) , there may be relatively little selective pressure against the accidental evolution of slippery sites throughout the middle regions of the polyprotein coding sequence. Indeed reducing the level of nonstructural protein synthesis, and simultaneously freeing up ribosomes, may even be beneficial for the virus. However, the common location of the JEV-serogroup and insect-specific flavivirus frameshift sites could also result from scenario (iii) if the NS2A/NS2B amino acid composition just happens to be particularly amenable to harbouring overlapping genes (e.g., it is unusually hydrophobic: codons for hydrophobic amino acids tend to have a 'U' or 'C' at position 2 which is incompatible with a \u22121/+2 frame stop codon, thus hydrophobic regions are compatible with a reduced frequency of stop codons in the \u22121/+2 frame). In this case, the close proximity of both frameshift sites to the 5\u2032 end of the NS2A coding sequence may have evolved simply to avoid splitting protein domains.",

(2005) observed a factor of three-to six-fold fewer NS4B and NS5B proteins than core proteins in cells infected with Hepatitis C virus (family Flaviviridae) which uses a similar polyprotein expression strategy and genome organization to the flaviviruses, implying that 66-83% of translating ribosomes may terminate earlyalbeit 3\u2032 of the core protein coding sequence. What remains uncertain is whether early termination is 'programmed' (i.e., occurring at specific sites, under purifying selection for this function) or whether it occurs randomly throughout the polyprotein coding sequence. While most polyprotein cleavage products of well-studied members of the Flaviviridae family have been well-characterized (including N-and C-terminal sequencing), there are a number of 'alternative' cleavage products in various flaviviruses that have been less well characterized and the potential for C-termini produced as a result of ribosomal frameshifting, as opposed to enzymatic cleavage, perhaps merits investigation. Furthermore, selection may favour frameshift sites that are located near to polyprotein cleavage sites so as to avoid splitting protein domains. (In, for example, those alphaviruses that utilize stop codon read-through to express the RdRp [alphavirus NSP4] as a fusion with NSP123, the C-terminal of NSP3 is defined in two wayseither by termination at the read-through stop codon or by cleavage from NSP4. However the NSP3|NSP4 cleavage site is just seven codons downstream of the read-through stop codon so that the two forms of NSP3 differ by only seven amino acids [Strauss and Strauss, 1994] .) Such trans-frame productsparticularly if the out-of-frame ORF is very shortmay have escaped notice as they may be difficult to distinguish from the analogous cleavage products.",

The firefly luciferase gene is in the \u2212 1 frame relative to the renilla luciferase gene such that \u2212 1 frameshifting within the inserted sequence results in a renilla-firefly luciferase fusion product. To introduce the CxFV and CFAV frameshift cassettes into the insect vector, pF25A ICE T7 Flexi (Promega), primers specific to the 5\u2032 end of renilla luciferase (TATAAAGCGATCGCCATGGCTTC-CAAGGTGTACGACCCC) and an internal region of firefly luciferase (AATTATGTTTAAACTTACCCATAGCGCTTCATAGCTTCTGCC) were used for PCR amplification.
