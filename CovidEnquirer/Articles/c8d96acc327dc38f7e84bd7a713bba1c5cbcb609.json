            "text": "Wendy Winsted, Ferrets, 1981 An overview Anyone concerned with ferret health will quickly realize that the ferret seems to stand between the dog and cat as regards disease problems, being the third companion animal. Considering viral conditions, ferrets get rabies like other carnivores. They can get canine distemper and many people working ferrets believed they also got feline influenza, in fact ferrets actually get human influenza. All viral infectious diseases in early twentieth century ferret books came under the title of 'the sweats'. With my first ferret, Fred, I gave him both canine distemper and feline enteritis vaccines a week apart to be sure! He showed no ill-effects on using 1 /6 dog/cat dosage.",

            "text": "Added to all other woes, the ferret has been used extensively in biomedical research as a considered good 'model' for the passage of viral and bacterial diseases, besides being used for a variety of experiments on various subjects. Ferrets have been used for the detection of various avian type influenza viruses such as H5N1. 1 Human isolates were fatal to intranasallyinoculated ferrets. Experimentally, ferrets have been found to be susceptible to pseudorabies, poliomyelitis, Newcastle disease, encephalomyelitis and sclerosis. 2 The Australian 1999 Newcastle disease outbreak in poultry, for instance, was said to be a mutation of the non-virulent Newcastle strain and not an imported virus (Commonwealth Agriculture Department, May statement). With the possible genetic changes of viruses over time and between species, the possibility of new disease patterns arising cannot be discounted. Human influenza was considered in a 1989 review of zoonotic diseases related to ferrets, as being the only disease for which there was a case report concerning transmission from ferret to man. Rabies is still a contentious subject regarding ferrets in the USA even though there has been no infection of man due to ferret bites. 3 Rabies has not been recorded naturally in ferrets in the USA, UK, Europe, Japan, Australia or New Zealand.",

            "text": "There was some concern from American authorities on the rabbit calicivirus possibly mutating between species but, as yet, there has been no proof of the disease being in any other wildlife, or dogs, cats, or ferrets. The horror of human Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease is well known. The possibility of the disease complexes known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting ferrets, from contaminated meat products, is debatable. TSE disease has been seen in farmed mink in the UK. 4 In Australia, the Hendra virus (HENV) (family Paramyxovidae, genus Henipavirus) killed horses and two men in 1994. A similar virus, the Nipah virus (NIPV) (genus Henipavirus) was found in pigs in Malaysia in 1999, originally suspected to be Japanese encephalitis (JE), which is spread by mosquitoes. 5 Note: ferrets get heartworm disease from mosquitoes (Ch. 10). NIPV was suspected of killing more than 100 people; the symptoms were high fever, aches, eventually coma and death. NIPV, related to but distinct from HENV, is a 'new' megamyxovirus, a genus of the paramyxovirus family. HENV only transmits easily between flying foxes (fruit bats Pteropus species) which are the natural hosts to HENV, NIPV and Australian Bat Lyssavirus (ABL). 6 It is considered that a fruit bat first infected pigs with NIPV; however, NIPV seems to be able to transmit easily between pigs and also between pigs and other animals including humans, horses, dogs, goats, and bats. 5 The position of the ferret in the scheme of things regarding virus infection is still of concern. The 2003 SARS disease complex involving the active coronavirus (an RNA virus) 7 has killed over 700 people in Asia and North America and has been traced to cats, raccoons and badgers which are sold in Chinese markets It is thought that the masked palm civet (genetically related to ferrets and cats) transmitted SARS to humans. The SARS coronavirus (SCV) has been shown to infect cats and ferrets and consequently these animals are possible 'models' to test antiviral drugs or vaccine candidates against the disease. The coronavirus can spread fairly well between humans and needs no vector. In a world where air travel is easy it is possible to visualize human to ferret transmission, to pet ferrets, remembering the incubation period in humans can be 2-10 days. In addition, the virus is able to survive outside the body in respiratory secretions or faeces. It is not susceptible to some common household detergents.",

            "text": "Note the ability of the coronavirus to be generally pathogenic in many species is considered to be a result of its RNA make-up. DNA viruses can be accurate reproductions of their own kind, but RNA viruses have errors in replicating (mutation trends) so that the mutation changes are a type of survival mechanism for the virus in adverse conditions, i.e. change from one body to another, animal to man, man to man. 7 The SARS coronavirus in this way shows an ancient similarity to the avian and bovine coronaviruses. Zoonotic virus distributing between the reservoir host (Hr) and the secondary host (Hs), which could in the future be the ferret, has been discussed by Childs. 6 The control of infectious diseases in Europe and indeed worldwide, in wildlife relates directly or indirectly to those diseases getting to the mustelids, polecats, feral ferrets or even domesticated ferrets. 8 The point is made in Europe that with rabies the dog reservoir is replaced by the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the bovine form of tuberculosis has been picked up by the Eurasian badger (Meles meles). A (Table 8 .1) and their hosts is interesting to consider with the fate of the mustelids wild or domestic, in mind. The extent of viral and bacterial infections alone can stimulate thoughts of possible infection of ferrets.",

These countries do not routinely vaccinate against rabies. Rabies occurs in wild foxes in Europe. A WHO survey, 1977-1998, recorded 464 cases of rabies in wild polecats across Europe. During the rabies surveillance, 48 of the 464 total polecats were said to be rabid ferrets (W. Mueller, WHO/OIE Reference Center for Rabies, T\u00fcbingen, Germany, pers. comm. 1998). Dr Mueller was of the opinion however, that the determination of species, whether polecat or ferret, was not always correct. Identification was done by veterinarians not biologists! Ferrets running wild and easily interbreeding with polecats could make identification difficult and it is fairly sure that the 48 rabid ferrets reported were in fact rabid polecats. In a 1998-2004 survey concerning pine marten and other mustelids, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine registered higher number of rabies cases with higher incidence in the targeted pine marten (Martes martes). The total rabies cases incidence peaked in 2002 for pine martens and in 2003 for other mustelids (W. Mueller, pers. comm. 2005).",

In the opinion of the WHO authorities, rabies vaccination for ferrets is not likely to be compulsory in the UK. This might be a safe bet for pet ferrets but it might be different for working ferrets. Rabies is of concern in the USA, where it has been given as the main reason for banning ferrets as pets in California (Ferrets Anonymous, California, pers. comm. 1996). It has been noted experimentally, that ferrets fed rabies-infected mice did not become infected and no serum antibodies were found in the ferret serum, which indicates the bite as the main means of transmission. 3 The mice probably did not get a chance to bite the ferrets! A Finnish veterinarian in 2004 showed concern that the EU had removed Russia from the list of high-risk countries. 9 Thus Russian owners of dogs, cats and ferrets need not show blood test results. Russians love their pet ferrets and hopefully desire to vaccinate them against rabies. The EU decision was considered political, not scientific and is a worry to Finland. The Baltic States have a problem with sylvatic rabies so the world's guard against rabies cannot be dropped with the advent of more open borders and fast travel. Australia is lucky being an island continent but in respect to rabies the northern islands of Indonesia and New Guinea could be a worry if a dog incubating rabies reached our shores from a fishing boat, etc.",

The worrying fact to North American pet ferret owners is that if their ferret strayed and was picked up by the local authorities, the ferret, even though vaccinated, might be euthanized directly. A Canadian report study recommended a suspect ferret from a bite situation be kept under observation for 10 days. 12 There is no treatment for rabies bites in animals, though a human survived after being bitten by a rabid bat and given a combination of drugs and an induced coma. 13 Research on an inactivated rabies vaccine specific for ferrets was carried out. 14 The potential of an immunoperoxidase technique for the diagnosis of general rabies in fresh tissues was found superior to other standard methods e.g. fluorescent antibody test. 15 The major rabies vaccine for ferrets for the past few years has been IMRAB 3 (Merial) in the USA and Canada. The initial rabies vaccination is a single shot (1 mL) given at 12 weeks of age. The usual yearly boosters apply (Brown, pers. comm. 1999). The vaccine Imrab 3TF (Merial) is used in the USA /Canada, while the latter country also uses Prorab (Intervet Canada). 16 Rabies vaccination is not carried out in Australia except by the special request of people working in rabies-affected countries like Indonesia.

It has been known since 1991 that, 3 months to 3 years after FeV or rabies vaccination, cats can get a site tumour, which may be a fibrosarcoma, a malignant fibrous histiocytoma or some sort of mesenchymal tumour. Murray in 1998 demonstrated concern about a ferret vaccine sarcoma in a letter to the AVMA. 17 The damage could be a combination of mechanical trauma and/or reaction to the vaccine material injected. In a 2000 study with dogs and cats, the outcome was a proposal of triennial vaccination at least for cats. 18 A 2002 assessment of response to commercial vaccines showed that cats differed from mink and ferrets. 19 A total of 24 1-year-old ferrets, 20 4-monthold mink and 20 4-month-old cats were vaccinated with three rabies virus vaccines, two leukaemia virus vaccines, alum adjuvant and saline to see what the local response would be on marked spots of the shaved dor-sum area. Injections were given under anaesthesia. Histological findings showed significant differences in the tissue response to the vaccinations between the three species with the cat showing more lymphocytic response to the three rabies vaccines. Production of collagen, fibroblasts and macrophages differed among the three killed aluminium-adjuvant vaccines in the cats but not in the ferrets or mink. In response to the two adjuvanted leukaemia virus vaccines, mink and ferrets produced more binucleate cells. It was considered the response differences in cats were because cats were more likely to get vaccine-associated sarcomas (VAS).",

The remaining three ferrets each had neoplasia but on the base of the tail, the ventral abdomen and the carpus. The ferret with the ventral abdominal tumour was one vaccinated with rabies/distemper combination. Of the seven, six had definite records of vaccination so the neoplasia were considered to be vaccination site fibrosarcoma or VSF. The tumours were nodular and 10-15 mm wide in the subcutis. The ferrets with VSFs were aged 1-9 years. Follow-up on three ferrets' postsurgical removal of the VSFs showed one tumour recurred after 3 months while the other two ferrets were clear at 8 and 12 months post-operation. The authors of the survey considered the results positive for VSFs in another species besides the cat. There is as yet no proof of a retrovirus involvement in VSFs in the cat or ferret. The location of these tumours at vaccination sites in ferrets suggests that vaccine material may predispose them to reactions.",

Influenza with its collection of virulent viruses has been the basis of the fear of a global epidemic. 25 Clinical signs: Typically, after 48 hours incubation, the ferret has a temperature of 40\u00b0C with a moist nose and inappetence. Sneezing occurs and the temperature fluctuates on alternate days as it does with humans. If the ferret continues eating consistently or intermittently, it is a good sign but if a purulent nasal discharge occurs despite medication, the outlook is a possibly fatal pneumonia. That working ferrets can succumb to pneumonia if kept in cold draughty conditions was even pointed out by the writer Nicholas Everitt in 1897.",

Figure 8 .6 shows the situation with two ferret kittens. 37 Kitten 1 (white line) has received a high level of passive immunity starting at 25 antibody titre. Kitten 2 (black line) has a lower level of immunity starting at 15. Thus if the titre level 10 is required for infection protection we see kitten 1 becom- ing susceptible at 6 weeks of age and kitten 2 susceptible at 14 weeks of age. Thus in a population of kittens, if vaccination was given only at 6 week of age or 8 weeks of age there would be part of the population which would not respond to the vaccination and therefore become susceptible to infection. If the first vaccination was at 14 weeks of age many of the kittens would have already lost their immunity. Heiler comments on the problem of assessing titres and what they mean. 38 She points out there are three main methods of measuring antibody levels, being fluorescent molecules technique, haemagglutination inhibition assay and serum neutralization test. In the latter, serum mixed with antibodies is mixed with live virus and is assayed to see how much active virus is still present. The serum goes through dilutions to find out what dilution protects, e.g. titre 1:10 etc. It could be that a titre of 1:32 is effective. Heiler points out that to get the absolute assurance of protection, challenge studies must be done on live animals and that would require sacrificing ferrets in a laborious and costly procedure. She suggests using only approved and proven vaccines and reminds us that the risk of reaction, although very real, cannot be avoided by running a titre. More studies are required on ferret vaccination against canine distemper, which again would require using ferrets.",

When considering the effects of AD on the body, he CHAPTER EIGHT Viral, bacterial and mycotic diseases \u2022 \u2022 \u25d7 \u25d7 states that comparisons with diseases of other animals are often mentioned, which include diseases that follow a similar pattern to AD but are in fact quite rare. Examples given are equine infectious anaemia, African swine fever and lymphocytic choroid meningitis of mice. 48 The normal response of an animal to invasion by a virus is to produce specific antibodies that bind that virus and neutralize its effects. If these antibodies do not overcome the virus then the disease progresses. This usually involves the destruction of specific areas of tissue within the body, such as the brain (rabies), liver (canine hepatitis), surface tissue (foot and mouth), etc. What makes AD an unusual type of disease is that mink and ferrets However, a repeat scenario occurred which is interesting with regard to the wide speculation of causative disease and the possible occurrence of Aleutian disease. A replacement sable hob, Gizmo, from the same pet shop and possibly same breeder, had been vaccinated and fed on Iams kitten food as before and was presented at 7 months of age with vestibular signs similar to the jill. He had a mild right foreleg weakness. Gizmo weighed 1500 g and had ear mites, which were treated this time with intra-aural Ivomectin (0.3 mL repeated 2 weeks later). No other antibiotics were given initially. The treatment removed the mites. He was bright but still weak on the right side. The owner agreed to further antibiotic cover using clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (Pfizer) and enrofloxacin (Baytril). A general weakness occurred with the ferret being immobile and inappetent, with urinary incontinence, so a switch of drugs was made to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole for better CNS penetration. A meningitis/encephalitis or brain abscess was suggested or something resembling GME in dogs. Unfortunately, chloramphenicol, another good CNS drug, is not available in New Zealand. In addition, the hob was treated with B vitamin complex for possible thiamine deficiency and was on dexamethasone (0.25 mg/kg s.c.) repeated intermittently every 3 days. There was some improvement in appetite, alertness and less incontinence but this was possibly due to steroid therapy as the hob did continue to decline showing ataxia, weakness and hyperflexion in all limbs.

There is concern for the routine testing of ferrets for AD antibodies. Many ferrets could fluctuate between positive and negative and it may be difficult to decide on these results. Evidently, the main problem appears to be that ferrets do not produce the same level of antibody in response to the AD virus as mink. It has been found experimentally that the rise in gammaglobulin in infected ferrets of 0.5-1 g/dL was lower than that of mink given the same challenge. 53 This shows that the tests for the mink are not sensitive enough to find the smaller rise in ferrets. Thus some ferrets' results could fluctuate with the test. The ideal screening should therefore be very sensitive. The ferrets that are then tested positive are therefore really positive.

In many instances, the ferrets are in air contact more with cats than dogs, as the former stay longer in the hospital. Personally, I have never experienced Bordetella in ferrets with a severe nasal discharge but usually a unilateral discharge, which has been treated as snuffles. The Bordetella pneumonia in ferrets is evidently difficult to treat but the B. bronchiseptica isolated from snuffles conditions responds to antibiotics after sensitivity tests on the nasal discharge. However, Bordetella can produce a toxin, which will result in convulsions and death and may be confused with a canine distemper diagnosis in ferrets. Bordetella bronchiseptica can be avoided by a vaccination 2 weeks before boarding ferrets. It should be boosted on the day of entry for boarding. 56 I have used CSL Canvac BB on my ferrets but have not eliminated unilateral nasal discharge periodically in one ferret, which I consider to be a 'snuffles' case. The vaccine appears safe for ferrets, being a killed product with the dog dose set at one vial. No laboratory trial has been done on ferrets to determine whether a part dose could serve, as with the distemper vaccination. It is important to note that the new intranasal vaccine for B. bronchiseptica with canine parainfluenza virus is not suitable for ferrets and could induce the disease. 56 Ferrets can cough for numerous reasons. Considering they are susceptible to lung conditions, it might be prudent to give a coughing ferret an oral antibiotic. I have done so with a ferret living in overnight coughing. It worked.

However, Teddy was put on a terbutaline (bronchodilator) syrup and was on Vibravet for 2 months. He was having at least 10 coughing fits a day. In March 2005, he was coughing 2-3 times a day. He was active and eating but his weight was down to 1200 g. He had two lots of medication, in April and July/August 2005. On examination in August, his heart and lungs were fine. The nasal discharge had some inflammatory cells and lymphocytes and scant bacteria so it was decided to take him off antibiotics for a while. In November 2005, he had been weaned off terbutaline and only coughed occasionally and produced some mucus. With twice daily exercises, he had no problem with clearing his throat and nose. The nasal discharge was the consistency of egg-white. Being off terbutaline his owner noticed 'he has put on weight from 1180 g in August to 1250 g and his body feels firmer, more muscular and he is stronger'. 60 The virus can cause bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia; they were able to replicate the virus in ferret kittens in the nasal tissue but not in the lungs. Although the clinical picture in the kittens showed no nasal discharges or mortality, the post mortem histological sections were consistent with mild rhinitis as seen in human infant infections. It was postulated that RSV could be more pathogenic in the younger animal and decreases in pathogenicity as the animal ages. An unknown mechanism, as the animal ages, acts in the lungs, but not the nose, to depress the pathogenicity of the virus. Thus if ferrets are somehow infected with such a virus from human contact, the nasal passage could harbour an ongoing infection similar to a repeat infection in humans.",

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (syn. pyocynea) is one of three species pathogenic to man and animals. 61 It is found in soil, water, decaying vegetation and also found on skin, mucous membranes and in faeces. In mink, it causes haemorrhagic pneumonia and is fatal, affecting mink of all ages. It is associated with the stress of autumn moults in laboratory mink. The animals are usually found dead. In the UK, where escaped mink established themselves around rivers, the possibility of this disease of mink affecting other mustelids could be of future concern. In the old fitch farms in New Zealand, ferrets, like mink, would show a bloody nasal discharge and on post mortem signs of haemorrhagic pneumonia in one or more lung lobes. There is no cure but clinically diseasefree stock can be vaccinated. 62 Pseudomonas aeruginosa can become resistant to some antiseptics and disinfectants. In human hospitals it is considered difficult to eradicate the bacterium once it is established so some concern could run parallel with veterinary hospitals in the future. 63 It is found that P. aeruginosa, when injected s.c. into rabbits, guinea pigs and mice can produce fever and local abscess formation so its pathogenicity should not be underestimated in small mammals such as ferrets in the right circumstances. 64 Thus ferrets living outside in a garden or ferretarium may be as much at risk as hunting ferrets, which might get the disease in an abscess developing from a bite wound.",

My ferret Pip, let out into the garden one evening after being fed, then killed a rat and refused to give it up. He would not come in and could have eaten it overnight. The next morning his character changed. He was not his 'weasel' dancing self but somewhat depressed. He did not stop eating however but was more inclined to curl up and sleep. The depression idea panicked me. Was he a leptospirosis case? On the other hand, he could have had a stomachache! He was given amoxicillin 10 mg/kg orally b.i.d. and Animalac to drink as I worried that his depression might be liver function related. He continued for a couple of days to be edgy and non-cooperative. Then he seemed to come out of it, became alert and was taking interest again. Had he been infected by eating the rat? Had my quick intervention with an antibiotic done the trick? I had no blood tests etc. done. I had wondered about vaccination but leptospirosis vaccination is only possible by using a 5-1 vaccine. I might have to consider such vaccination. If ferrets do have a natural resistance to Leptospira, could I be worrying for nothing?",

She was a pet shop ferret and fed Iams food. She was presented with profound weakness on the left front and rear limbs with UMN signs in all four limbs but mostly on the left. She was mentally depressed with reduced appetite. The vestibular signs were on the left side and ear mites were detected bilaterally. The clinical signs suggested a lesion on the left side of the brain stem level of CNVIII. A provisional, broad-range diagnosis was made of parasitic/bacterial otitis being externa, media or possibly interna with a secondary meningitis with a differential of distemper, trauma, toxicity, thiamine deficiency, Aleutian disease and lymphoblastic encephalitis. The jill was treated with Del-Mycin Ear Drops (Delta Labs) on a 5-day course then 10-day break followed by a 5-day course, plus an antibiotic course of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin. A blood check under Domitor sedation proved normal. There were some periods of intermittent improvement over the following weeks but the jill deteriorated, stopped eating and became very weak, losing consciousness. It was euthanized on request. No post mortem was possible.",
