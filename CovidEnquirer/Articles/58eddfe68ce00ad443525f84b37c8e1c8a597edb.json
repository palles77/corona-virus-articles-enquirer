Objectives: In order to find drugs that treat coronavirus infections, including SARS, we screened traditional medicinal herbal extracts and evaluated their antiviral activities on coronavirus replication. Study design: We employed a plaque assay to evaluate the effect of 22 medicinal herbal extracts on virus replication. We determined the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of each extract that was necessary to inhibit the replication of mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59); we also determined 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC 50 ) for each extract. Northern and Western blot analyzes were performed to investigate antiviral activity in MHV-infected DBT cells, including virus entry, viral RNA and protein expression, and virus release. Coronavirus specific inhibition was also demonstrated using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). Results: Cimicifuga rhizoma, Meliae cortex, Coptidis rhizoma, Phellodendron cortex and Sophora subprostrata radix decreased the MHV production and the intracellular viral RNA and protein expression with EC 50 values ranging from 2.0 to 27.5 g/ml. These extracts also significantly decreased PEDV production and less dramatically decreased vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) production in vitro. Conclusions: The extracts selected strongly inhibited MHV replication and could be potential candidates for new anti-coronavirus drugs.",

            "text": "The development of coronavirus specific therapy has been hampered until recently due to its relatively low burden on human disease; however, identification of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the cause of SARS in the spring of 2003 stimulated research in this field. Since then, several anti-SARS agents have been tested for coronavirus-specific therapy; however, an effective SARS antiviral therapy has not yet been established (Groneberg et al., 2005; Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2006; Stockman et al., 2006) . Ribavirin, a synthetic nucleoside with a broad antiviral activity, is most frequently administered as a SARS-antiviral agent in combination with corticosteroids; however, this has little activity against SARS-CoV in vitro (Cinatl et al., 2003) . SARS-CoV specific monoclonal antibodies, pegylated interferon-\u2423, siRNA, and several protease inhibitors have also been tested against SARS-CoV (in reviews, Cinatl et al., 2005; Groneberg et al., 2005; Haagmans and Osterhaus, 2006) . Glycyrrhizin, pyridine N-oxide derivatives, ATPase and helicase inhibitors, and 4-aminoquinoline chloroquine have also been found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in vitro (Balzarini et al., 2006; Cinatl et al., 2003; Keyaerts et al., 2004; Tanner et al., 2005) . Wu et al. (2004) tested more than 10,000 agents, including more than 1000 traditional Chinese herbs, and found 50 active compounds. Interestingly, they found that 10 of these compounds, including aescin, reserpine, and ginsenoside-Rb1, came from natural products that have been used clinically (Wu et al., 2004) .",

We could not determine the EC 90 of Moutan cortex radicis due to a low anti-MHV activity (Figs. 1 and 2, and Table 2 ). As expected, 10% of the MHV was produced when DBT cells were treated at EC 90 (data not shown). In order to analyze the inhibition on viral entry, one set of DBT cells was infected with 2 MOI of MHV-A59 in the presence of extracts (EC 90 ) from the adsorption period throughout the infection cycle. A second set of DBT cells were preadsorbed with MHV-A59 for 1 h at 4 \u2022 C without extracts, and un-adsorbed viruses were washed out. MHV-preadsorbed DBT cells were temperature-shifted to 37 \u2022 C at which temperature the viruses would be endocytosed, and they were further incubated with extracts at EC 90 until completion of the experiment. We expected to discern whether the extracts interfered with virus replication at the entry point, or during the subsequent transcription or translation processes by comparing the RNA and protein expression in these two sets of MHV-infected and extract-treated DBT cells. If MHVpreadsorbed DBT cells expressed more or the same amount of viral RNA and protein as those of the MHV-infected and simultaneously extract-treated cells, it would indicate that the extract interfered with viral entry. In this experiment, however, all of the MHV-preadsorbed cells expressed less viral RNA and protein than the other set of cells (Fig. 4) , indicating that viral entry was not the main target of the extracts tested.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that viral entry was not the main target; however, viral RNA synthesis was significantly decreased (Figs. 1 and 3A) , suggesting that the underlying antiviral mechanism might be the inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or proteases that are crucial for coronavirus RNA replication. Furthermore, RNA synthesis and N and S expression was inhibited more drastically in Cimicifuga rhizoma-, Phellodendron cortex-, and Sophora subprostrata radix-treated cells than Meliae cortex-and Coptidis rhizometreated cells, indicating that Meliae cortex and Coptidis rhizome might also partly affect virus assembly or release.",

We could not exclude the possibility that the extracts tested in our study also inhibited cellular mechanisms that are used by viruses during replication. This would be interesting to test in the future. Nonetheless, the decrease in MHV that we observed in response to extract treatment was very strong compared to that of VSV, suggesting that the extracts are specific MHV inhibitors.",
