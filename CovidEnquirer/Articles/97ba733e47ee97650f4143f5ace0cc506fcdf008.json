Diarrhea in the immunocompromised host, traveler's diarrhea, and diarrhea in the hospitalized patient are also discussed. Most episodes of acute diarrhea are self-limited, and investigations should be performed only if the results will influence management and outcome. After an adequate history and physical examination, the clinician should be able to classify the acute diarrheal illness, assess the severity, and determine whether investigations are needed. Most patients do not require specific therapy. Therapy should mainly be directed at prevent-ing dehydration. Various home remedies frequently suffice in mild, self-limited diarrhea. However, in large-volume, dehydrating diarrhea, oral rehydration solutions should be used, as they are formulated to stimulate sodium and water absorption. Antidiarrheal agents can be useful in reducing the number of bowel movements and diminishing the magnitude of fluid loss. The most useful agents are opiate derivatives and bismuth subsalicylate. Antibiotic therapy is not required in most patients with acute diarrheal disorders. Guidelines for their use are presented. Am J Med. 1999;106:670 -676. \u1b671999",

Thus any hospitalized patient who develops diarrhea, especially if the patient had been treated with a cephalosporin or clindamycin, should be evaluated for the presence of C. difficile toxin.

Enterotoxigenic E. coli produce disease by adherence to the mucosa and the production of toxins, which may be heat labile or heat stable. Their distribution is worldwide and accounts for most cases of traveler's diarrhea. Enteropathogenic E. coli have been associated primarily with diarrhea in children \u03fd2 years old, although they can cause traveler's diarrhea. Enteroinvasive E. coli can invade mucosa and can produce a dysentery-like syndrome similar to Shigella. Enteroadherent E. coli are the most poorly understood; they may cause persistent diarrhea in children. These four types of diarrheagenic E. coli are rarely diagnosed, because the necessary laboratory tests are not routinely available. Infection with enterohemorrhagic E. coli is characterized by colitis with bloody diarrhea (hemor-rhagic colitis), which may be complicated by the hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Although it can be caused by different serotypes of E. coli that elaborate Shiga-like toxins, serotype 0157:H7 is the most common type. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection is both endemic and epidemic in the United States. It is transmitted by food, most commonly ground meat, and it can be isolated easily by hospital laboratories, through the use of Sorbitol-MacConkey agar and specific typing serum. An ELISA for detection of Shiga-like toxin(s) in stool is available but not yet in routine use.",

Other enteric pathogens such as Yersinia, Vibrio, and E. coli 0157:H7 are not routinely sought. Therefore, if the clinical suspicion for these organisms is high, the microbiology department needs to be notified. If the medical history suggests risk factors for C. difficile, such as recent antibiotic exposure, recent hospitalization, day-care exposure, or recent chemotherapy, stool should be tested for C. difficile toxin. More invasive investigations, including flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with duodenal aspirate and biopsies, are reserved for special situations, such as an immunocompromised patient in whom stool examination has not yielded a diagnosis (Table 3) .",

The misconception that the bowel needs to be at rest or that oral intake will worsen the diarrheal illness should be abandoned. It is important, however, to avoid milk and other lactose-containing products, because viral or bacterial enteropathogens often result in transient lactase deficiency, leading to lactose malabsorption. Caffeine-containing products should be avoided, because caffeine increases cyclic AMP levels, thus promoting secretion of fluid and worsening diarrhea.",

Rather, glucose-containing electrolyte solutions should be used. Glucose in the intestinal lumen facilitates the absorption of sodium and, thereby, of water (7) . This co-transport mechanism is usually unaffected by infectious microorganisms or their toxins. Several oral rehydration solutions have been developed to take advantage of the glucose-sodium-coupled transport mechanism (Table 4) . Several are commercially available and are strongly recommended for use in adults as well as children.",

The major effect of opiate derivatives is to slow the intestinal transit time, although they also possess a pro-absorptive or antisecretory effect in the intestine (21) . Anticholinergic agents are not effective for controlling symptoms and may cause significant adverse side effects. They are therefore not recommended.
