We instead considered the 145 possibility that the SRE functions like an RNA 'zip code', directing its associated transcript 146 to a location in the cell inaccessible to endonucleases. To test this hypothesis, we used RNA 147 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to monitor how the presence of the IL-6 SRE 148 impacted the localization of its associated mRNA. Six phage MS2-derived stem-loops were 149 introduced upstream of the SRE or \u0394SRE segment of the IL-6 3' UTR in the pcDNA3 150 luciferase reporter, enabling visualization of the RNA in transfected 293T cells using a Cy3-151 labeled RNA probe directed against the MS2 sequences [42] . We verified that the presence 152 of the stem-loops did not prevent the escape of the SRE-containing reporter or degradation 153 of the \u0394SRE reporter in SOX-expressing cells (Fig. S1) . There was no distinguishable 154 difference in the localization of the SRE and \u0394SRE containing mRNAs, both of which were 155 present relatively diffusely throughout the cell (Fig. 1C) . The FISH signal was specific to 156 transfected cells, as we observed no fluorescence in neighboring untransfected cells nor 157 autofluorescence from transfected cells lacking the Cy3 probes (Fig. 1C) . Although these 158 data to not exclude the possibility that the SRE-containing transcript became sequestered 159 into micro-aggregates or other structures not visible at this level of resolution, they do not 160 support relocalization as the driver of escape from viral endonuclease cleavage. 161 162 We next considered whether the inability to cleave an IL-6 SRE-containing 163 transcript was specific to viral endonucleases or similarly extended to host endonucleases. 164",

Here, we reveal that a ~200 nt sequence present in the 3' UTR of the cellular IL-329 6 mRNA functions as a broad-acting, virus-specific endonuclease escape element, and 330 identify a similar element in the GADD45B 3' UTR. Although these two SREs are not 331 identical in their protective capacity, they display some sequence and putative structural 332 similarities and are both functionally dependent on HuR binding. We hypothesize that 333 these may therefore be representative members of a new type of RNA regulatory element 334 engaged during viral endonuclease-triggered mRNA decay. Determining whether other 335 such elements exist in mammalian or viral mRNAs is an important future goal, as is 336",

This is in line with the fact that RNP assembly can be more 341 heavily impacted by structural fidelity than primary sequence recognition [59]. We 342 hypothesize that there is a core set of proteins required for SRE function, such as HuR, but 343 that individual SREs recruit distinct accessory factors that dictate the conditions or 344 mechanism by which that SRE protects against nuclease targeting. In this regard, we have 345 not found significant overlap between known HuR mRNA targets and mRNAs that are not 346 downregulated by SOX [22] .

We 266 therefore performed Comprehensive Identification of RNA binding Proteins by Mass 267 Spectrometry (ChIRP-MS) to compare the set of proteins bound in vivo to the IL-6 and 268 GADD45B 3'UTRs in transfected 293T cells (Fig. 5A). Briefly, ChIRP-MS involves purifying 269 an RNA of interest along with its associated proteins from crosslinked, sonicated cells using 270 specific RNA probe-based capture, then identifying the bound proteins by MS [58]. Control 271 probes directed against GFP were included to identify nonspecific interactions, which were 272 then filtered out of the dataset. Using ChIRP-MS, we identified 195 proteins associated with 273 the GADD45B 3'UTR and 245 proteins associated with the IL-6 3'UTR, of which 124 were in 274 common between the two sets (Table S1 & Fig. S5).

            "text": "that the IL-6 SRE in particular acts against diverse viral 358 endonucleases but does not impact host endonucleases has important implications for 359 understanding target recognition by these host shutoff factors. First, it suggests that there 360 are key commonalities to how the viral endonucleases are recruited to mRNAs, and that 361 these features are distinct from those involved in cellular endonuclease recruitment. The 362 viral endonucleases recognize translation competent mRNAs, but do not require ongoing 363 translation for cleavage [10]. While vhs is recruited to a 5' cap proximal location due to its 364 interaction with a eIF4H, the SOX homologs do not respond to particular location cues on 365 their target mRNA, and instead recognize a degenerate target motif that can be positioned 366 anywhere [10,21,69-71]. PA-X has been suggested to bind RNA processing factors in the 367 nucleus, but how it recognizes cytoplasmic mRNA targets remains unknown [72]. By 368 contrast, the cellular NMD and no-go decay quality control pathways show a clear 369 dependence on translation for target recognition, and mRNA cleavage occurs at the site of 370 the error or translation stall [13]. The observation that neither the IL-6 nor GADD45B SREs 371 impede these cellular endonucleases indicates that SREs are not inhibitory to translation. 372 Furthermore, our FISH data do not support mRNA relocalization or sequestration as a 373 of SRE-mediated escape. We instead hypothesize that the SRE somehow 374 occludes one or more factors required for recruitment of the viral endonucleases. This 375 could occur via long-range interactions with mRNA cap-associated proteins, which we 376 previously showed can take place for the IL-6 SRE [27]. The fact that the GADD45B SRE 377 restricts against a more limited set of host shutoff factors argues against a single factor 378 requirement. However, it is possible that there are multiple binding sites on one factor that 379 are more comprehensively blocked by the IL-6 SRE. Independent of the mechanisms 380 involved, nuclease escape elements could be developed as tools to broadly inhibit viral 381 endonucleases without disrupting normal RNA decay pathways. 382 How might viruses benefit from maintaining the expression of IL-6 and GADD45B 383 during infection? The requirement for IL-6 during KSHV infection is well documented [30-384 38], but the role of GADD45B may be more nuanced. While we demonstrated that it 385 escapes host shutoff during lytic KSHV infection and appears important for viral 386 reactivation in the iSLK.219 model, GADD45B expression is repressed by viral miRNAs 387 during latency to avoid its cell cycle arrest and pro-apoptotic functions [73]. However, 388 GADD45B has a number of additional activities that could be necessary for the viral lytic 389 cycle. These include promoting DNA demethylation and Retinoblastoma (Rb) inactivation, 390 processes that are important for a number of DNA viruses, including KSHV [74-79]. If our 391",

A 198 transcript that fit these criteria was growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta 199 (GADD45B). Notably, the GADD45B mRNA was also previously shown to escape 200 degradation in HSV-1 vhs-expressing cells, further suggesting it might contain an SRE [52-201 54]. We first examined whether the GADD45B mRNA was resistant to host shutoff upon 202 lytic reactivation of a KSHV-positive B cell line (TREX-BCBL1) and a renal carcinoma cell 203 line stably expressing the KSHV BAC16 (iSLK.219). Both TREX-BCBL1 and iSLK.219 cells 204 harbor a doxycycline (dox)-inducible version of the major viral lytic transactivator RTA 205 that promotes entry into the lytic cycle upon dox treatment [55,56].
