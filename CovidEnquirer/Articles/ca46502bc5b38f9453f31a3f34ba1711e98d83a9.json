            "text": "Introduction Respiratory viruses causing lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are a major cause of hospital admissions in children. Since the course of these infections is unpredictable with potential fast deterioration into respiratory failure, infants are easily admitted to the hospital for observation. The aim of this study was to examine whether systemic inflammatory markers can be used to predict severity of disease in children with respiratory viral infections. Methods Blood and nasopharyngeal washings from children <3 years of age with viral LRTI attending a hospital were collected within 24 hours (acute) and after 4-6 weeks (recovery). Patients were assigned to a mild (observation only), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding) or severe (mechanical ventilation) group. Linear regression analysis was used to design a prediction rule using plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), serum amyloid P component and properdin. This rule was tested in a validation cohort. Results One hundred and four children (52% male) were included. A combination of CRP, SAA, PTX3 and properdin was a better indicator of severe disease compared with any of the individual makers and age (69% sensitivity (95% CI 50 to 83), 90% specificity (95% CI 80 to 96)). Validation in 141 patients resulted in 71% sensitivity (95% CI 53 to 85), 87% specificity (95% CI 79 to 92), negative predictive value of 64% (95% CI 47 to 78) and positive predictive value of 90% (95% CI 82 to 95). The prediction rule was not able to identify patients with a mild course of disease. Conclusion A combination of CRP, SAA, PTX3 and properdin was able to identify children with a severe course of viral LRTI disease, even in children under 2 months of age. To assess the true impact on clinical management, these results should be validated in a prospective randomised control study.",

            "text": "Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) annually result in hospitalisation of 0.9%-1.36% of a birth cohort. 1 2 Eventually, 6% to 15% of these patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 1 3 Young age and prematurity are the most important risk factors for severe diseases. This is reflected by the fact that over 50% of the children admitted to the ICU have no other risk factors besides young age. 1 4 5 Infants under 2 to 3 months of age are easily admitted to the hospital due to a potentially rapid progression of disease. More than one-third of all patients hospitalised with acute respiratory viral infections do not receive supportive care. 5 However, 5% of the Prospective observational study in two Dutch hospitals to assess the performance of inflammatory plasma markers to determine disease severity of viral respiratory tract infections in children Inge M L Ahout, 1 Open Access patients discharged from the emergency room require readmission at a later stage of the infection. 6 Therefore, there is a need for biomarkers that can predict the course of disease in infants with viral respiratory tract infections. Currently, there are clinical prediction rules to predict safe discharge, length of hospitalisation and ICU admission for children with acute respiratory viral infections based on demographic criteria and clinical symptoms. 4 5 7-11 Although these clinical prediction rules show the potential to improve clinical judgement, validation in other cohorts is often lacking or implementation in daily practice is difficult due to subjective criteria. 8 9 Moreover, children under 2 months of age were either excluded or the studies were designed in such a way that all patients in this age group were automatically admitted to the hospital. A more objective, reproducible and sensitive prediction of disease severity for all age groups may be achieved by using biochemical and haematological markers. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Therefore, plasma proteins that were not yet extensively studied in the context of viral LRTI were identified from the literature. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) has been described as an early sensitive and specific marker for bacterial pneumonia in bronchoalveolar lavages of mechanically ventilated adults, and as a severity marker of meningococcal disease in children. 17 18 In 2016, a study was published that showed that PTX3 levels are also a marker for LRTI in children and is more sensitive than C reactive protein (CRP), which is frequently used in clinical care. 19 No correlation between CRP levels and severity of viral disease has been described. When CRP levels are very high, they indicate bacterial infection; however, often, CRP is moderately increased and then CRP is not able to differentiate between viral or bacterial aetiology of infection. [20] [21] [22] [23] Serum amyloid A (SAA) appears to be more sensitive than CRP for the detection of bacterial infections in neonates, although it is not used in daily practice. 24 The SAA/CRP ratio can be used as a marker for severe disease in children with bacterial infections. 25 Nakayama et al have shown that SAA levels increase in children with different viral infections, including viral LRTI. However, an association with disease severity was not established. 26 Serum amyloid P component (SAP) can activate the classical complement pathway and interacts with mannan-binding lectin. SAP is part of a family of pattern recognition receptors, the pentraxin family. CRP and PTX3 belong to the same family. SAP is involved in inflammation and used as a marker for atherosclerosis and autoimmune disease. 27 Skinner et al have shown that SAP levels were not increased during bacterial pneumonia, suggesting a limited potential as biomarker in infectious disease. 28 No studies were found that assessed the role of SAP during viral infections; since its family members show potential as biomarker in viral disease, we decided to include SAP in this study.",

Patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, immunosuppressive medication (including >24 hours of corticosteroids) or severe psychomotor retardation were excluded. Eligible patients were identified by their physician who diagnosed a viral LRTI and notified the study team. In both hospitals, it was not common practice to perform laboratory, rontgen or viral diagnostics at time of presentation; therefore, inclusions were made based on clinical appearance. When informed consent of both parents was obtained within 24 hours of admission, patients were included in the study. Data on clinical parameters, course of disease, medical history and demographics were retrieved from medical records and questionnaires retrieved at inclusion and after 4-6 weeks. Participation in this study did not influence medical care, and study results from individual patients were not shared with the medical team. Retrospectively, after discharge patients were allocated into three groups: mild, send home or only clinical observation; moderate, patients with need for supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding; and severe, patients with mechanical ventilation. Supplemental oxygen was started according to the protocols from the clinical wards in patients with an oxygen saturation of \u226492% for at least 10 min after use of decongestives.

The optimal predictive combination of proteins was selected using the M5 method linear regression, which removes classifiers with the smallest standardised coefficient one-by-one until no decrease in error estimate is observed. The outcome of the obtained rule was analysed for its receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). Cut-off values were determined for both mild and severe disease. These cut-offs were subsequently validated in a second cohort. A two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Plasma levels of SAP were also equal between the different disease severities ( figure 2C ). SAA plasma levels, however, were significantly higher during severe disease compared with mild disease ( figure 2D ). CFP plasma levels did not differ between mild and moderate disease. In contrast to the other markers, the CFP plasma levels dropped significantly in patients with severe disease (figure 2E).",

The increase of CRP and SAA levels during viral infection was known and this was also the reason to include the proteins in our study. We were able to confirm the work of Huttunen et al that the ratio SAA/CRP is significantly decreased in patients with severe disease compared with patients with mild and moderate disease (data not shown). 25 Moreover, CRP and SAA levels both correlated with severity of viral LRTIs and CRP was also correlated with length of hospitalisation. To the best of our knowledge, these findings have not been described before. The increase in PTX3 levels during more severe disease and a correlation with need for supplemental oxygen show the potential of PTX3 as biomarker for viral LRTI in children. This was already proposed by others, who saw a correlation with peak temperature, duration of fever and presence of pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients. 17 19 Although SAP levels significantly increase during infection, no correlation could be observed with disease severity in children with viral LRTI. Therefore, it appears that SAP could not be used as a biomarker for disease severity in viral or bacterial infections. 28 This study is the first to describe the remarkable kinetics of CFP (properdin) levels, which decrease during severe viral infection in children. We were unable to find an explanation in the literature. However, since CFP levels restored in the available recovery samples, a deficiency is highly unlikely. Other possible explanations for the decrease might be consumption, as occurs with other complement factors, or an unrecognised bacterial coinfection. Although cultures were routinely taken at the intensive care unit before the start of selective digestive decontamination (SDD) antibiotics, bacterial infections cannot be ruled out completely. A subanalysis of patients with (n=10) and without (n=15) positive bacterial cultures on the ICU showed no difference in protein levels (data not shown). During the study period, SDD was standard practice in the ICU and, therefore, all severe patients would have had at least one gift of prophylactic antibiotics before the study samples were taken.",

However, the performance in children less than 2 months of age (AUC 0.88) is promising and might provide additive value in clinical decision-making. Currently, there are no comparable laboratory-based studies assessing the identification of mild disease. Clinical rules for safe discharge based on age and findings at physical examination have been developed. Unfortunately, in these studies, children below 2 months of age were excluded or automatically admitted regardless of the necessity of treatment. 5 33 37 38 The identification of patients with severe disease was accurate with the chosen inflammatory markers (AUC 0.89). The prediction performed better than age on itself (AUC 0.77). A prediction rule based on interleukin-8 and Open Access regulated on activation, normal T Cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) in plasma and CD4 + T cell counts accurately identifies severe disease but needs to be validated in an independent cohort to establish clinical potential. 16 A combination of biochemical, haematological and clinical data might further improve accuracy. A drawback of introducing clinical variables is that most of the published risk factors in clinical prediction are not objective or may change rapidly in time. Moreover, signs and symptoms of children can be ambiguous at the moment of presentation and only become clear after prolonged observation. Prediction rules using clinical data often show a lower AUC and validation studies of these rules are lacking or have a smaller sample size. 4 39 Limitations of our study are the limited number of patients in the mild age group, especially patients younger than 2 months of age. This influenced our analyses and hindered the logistic regression analysis in the prediction of mild disease. Since venapuncture is not always part of routine care, especially not in this patient group, parents often refuse participation or the venapuncture specific. Therefore, the performance of our rule in the mild patient group under 2 months of age needs further testing Moreover, a prospective study in which results are available for the clinicians is needed to assess the clinical implications of our rule.",

Bruun et al studied plasma levels of CRP and SAA in children and neonates, including preterms in healthy and diseased state. They demonstrated that with increasing age (preterm up to child), higher CRP and SAA levels are being produced during disease. 40 Although when patients were healthy, the differences resolve.

            "text": "It would be interesting to perform a study that assesses the plasma levels of our markers at different time points during viral infections to increase our insight in the kinetics. It is assumed that some biomarkers precede clinical symptoms and could therefore be used early in the course of disease to predict severe outcomes. The advantage of measuring markers in plasma is the possibility for easy implementation in current diagnostic laboratory settings, relative short time to measure, reproducibility of the assays and available options for standardisation. Moreover, with the use of tools for linear regression modelling, it is easy to add new markers to further optimise the predictive rule. In general, our results indicate that combining markers, in our case inflammatory proteins, could increase the performance of a test. This indicates that this method might also be useful in other settings. More specifically, due to the validation in an independent cohort, we can assume that our decision rule will perform as well in other hospital settings. Whether the combination of these plasma markers could also be used to predict severe bacterial infections need to be assessed in other studies.",

            "text": "Currently, there is no targeted therapy for most respiratory viruses and, therefore, there are no consequences to the early identification of patients with a severe course of disease besides optimisation of supportive care. The identification of children with a mild course of disease has more visible consequences, as can be measured in reduced hospitalisation rates or length of stay in the hospital. To truly estimate the value of the markers, a prospective study is needed. However, even before the markers are implemented in the clinic, biomarkers could be used to stratify patients in clinical studies and as secondary end-point in intervention studies. With the current development of point-of-care tests, plasma protein levels can be available within a relevant time frame and could be beneficial for care in emergency rooms and by the general practitioner.",

To view these files please visit the journal online (http:// dx. doi. org/ 10. 1136/ bmjopen-2016-014596). Two independent cohorts of young infants were used to identify and validate plasma biomarkers to assess severity of disease in children with viral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). \u25ba Linear regression modelling was used to combine markers to optimise predictive value. \u25ba Performance of our model was tested and validated in children under 2 months of age, the group that is clinically most relevant for severedisease. \u25ba Other known inflammatory markers, such as procalcitonin, were not included and could have increased the clinical performance of test. \u25ba This observational cohort study was performed during hospital admission of children with clinical signs of viral LRTI, validation in earlier stages of disease at GP office or ER would be more informative regarding clinical application.",
