            "text": "of viral genomes have revealed alternative coding strategies, and have led to the discovery of distinctive structural features of viral nucleic acids including terminal repeats, inverted terminal repeats, and inversion of genome segments. Insight into chromatin structure has been provided by studies of the nucleoprotein organization of genomes in small DNA viruses, consisting of histones bound to the viral DNA. The replication of viral genomes has also provided in uivo and in uitro model systems for studies of viral and cellular DNA replication (Challberg and Kelly, 1989) . Viruses with limited coding capacities, such as parvo-and papovaviruses, replicate in the nucleus using host cell machinery. The development of in vitro systems for replicating the genomes of these viruses (Li and Kelly, 1984; N. Muzyczka, personal communication) is leading to a greater understanding of the biochemistry of eukaryotic DNA replication. The larger DNA viruses, including adenoviruses, herpesviruses, and poxviruses, encode many of the enzymes needed for their replication. The biochemistry of adenovirus replication has been investigated extensively in in uitro systems; the essential viral products required for the replication of herpes simplex virus and for Epstein-Barr virus have been genetically defined (Challberg and Kelly, 1979; Wu, 1988; Fixman, 1992) .",

The presence of specific receptors is an important determinant of cellular susceptibility to virus infection. Several virus receptors have now been identified; the details of their molecular interactions with viral surface proteins are being actively investigated. The best characterized of these receptors is the CD4 molecule, which serves as a receptor for HIV. Other cellular factors may also be involved as determinants of cell tropism at a postreceptor stage. Following virus entry, the replication process of some viruses is initiated in the cytoplasm, whereas for other viruses the incoming genome is transported to the nucleus. Evidence has been obtained that specific internal proteins of HIV are associated with viral nucleoproteins during their transport to the nucleus (Bukrinsky et al., 1993) . The transport of such viral nucleoproteins may serve as a model for cellular transport processes. Viruses that enter cells by endocytosis serve as convenient markers for tracing cellular endocytic pathways, and have been used to recognize distinct classes of endocytic membranes following infection (Marsh et al., 1986; Schmid et al., 1989) .",

For some viruses, fusion can occur at neutral pH at the cell surface, whereas other viruses first enter cells through endocytosis; the acidic pH within the endosomal compartment results in a conformational change that activates the viral membrane fusion activity (White et al., 1983) . Viral membrane fusion serves as a model for investigation of cellular fusion processes occurring at the cell surface. One example of a cellular fusion protein that resembles viral fusion proteins in some respects has been described (White, 1992) .",

These proteins possess a hydrophobic stretch of amino acids that is exposed at the N-terminal end of the cleavage site. Mutagenesis studies (Daniels et al., 1985) have revealed that this stretch of amino acids is important for membrane fusion activity; thus it has been designated the \"fusion peptide.\" In influenza virus, a dramatic change in the three-dimensional structure of HA occurs on exposure to low pH; this change exposes the hydrophobic fusion peptide (Carr and Kim, 1993) . Other viral fusion proteins that do not undergo cleavage activation also possess functional regions involved in fusion activity (White et al., 1983) . Ongoing studies of viral fusion proteins are providing new information on the structural requirements for fusion activity.",

The antiviral drug amantadine, which inhibits influenza virus penetration (Kato and Eggers, 1969; Skehel et al., 1978) , exerts its inhibitory effect on the M2 protein . Amantadine blocks the M2 ion channel activity (Pinto et al., 1992; Wang et al., 19931, indicating that this activity functions during the early stages of virus infection. Evidence has been obtained that dissociation of the viral matrix protein (Ml) from the nucleocapsids is inhibited in the presence of amantadine (Bukrinskaya et al., 1982; Martin and Helenius, 1991) , indicating that the transport of H + ions by the ion channel is involved in promoting this dissociation. An additional function of M2 in some virus strains is the regulation of Golgi complex pH, preventing the intracellular activation of the fusion activity of the influenza HA protein (Ciampor et al., 1992; Sugrue et al., 1990) . The identification of such a viral ion channel protein provides a convenient system for detailed studies of its essential structural features.",

The mature protein remains anchored to the membrane by a hydrophobic stretch of 20 amino acids near the C terminus (Rose and Bergmann, 1982) . Viral glycoproteins have also been utilized to study the process of protein glycosylation as well as the functional role of carbohydrate side chains. The transfer of high mannose oligosaccharides to the polypeptide chain and their subsequent modification during intracellular transport have been studied extensively with viral glycoproteins such as influenza HA protein (Compans, 1973; Klenk et al., 1974; Nakamura and Compans, 1979) and VSV-G protein (Hubbard and Ivatt, 1981) .

            "text": "Enveloped viruses have been used extensively for studies of membrane structure and biogenesis. The viral envelope is acquired by a process of budding at a cellular membrane; during the budding process the envelope of the emerging virus particle is continuous with the cellular membrane where virus assembly takes place. The lipids of the viral envelope closely resemble the lipid composition of the membranes of the host cell (Klenk and Choppin, 1969) . However, the proteins that are incorporated into the viral envelope are encoded by the viral genome. Thus, assembly of enveloped viruses involves the formation of a localized region on a cellular membrane, in which cellular membrane proteins are replaced by virus-encoded membrane proteins, that is recognized by the viral nucleocapsid leading to the release of an enveloped virus particle by a budding process. Therefore it is possible to obtain virus preparations containing the same protein components but different membrane lipids by growth of the same virus in two different cell types. Conversely, growth of two different enveloped viruses in the same cell type will yield viruses with similar membrane lipids but different envelope proteins. This ability to modulate viral lipids or proteins independently has been useful in studies of viral membrane biology (Lenard and Compans, 1974) . Enveloped virus particles also represent useful systems for studies of physiological properties such as membrane permeability. The membranes of VSV were found to undergo swelling and shrinking in response to changes in osmotic conditions (Bittman et al., 1976) . Thus, it is possible to study the effects of specific changes in lipid or protein composition on permeability properties, since these changes can be readily introduced into viral membranes. Because enveloped viruses contain a small number of virus-encoded proteins, and because preparing highly purified preparations of enveloped particles is comparatively simple, such virus particles constituted one of the systems of choice for early studies of the organization of lipids and proteins in biological membranes (Harrison et al., 1971; Landsberger et al., 1971) . The protein components of viral envelopes were found to be asymmetrically distributed, with the external surfaces consisting of glycosylated proteins forming a layer of spike-Like projections covering the surface of the virus particle (Cartwright et d., 1970; Compans et al., 1970; Schulze, 1970; Rifkin and Compans, 1971 ). In contrast, the internal proteins of enveloped viruses were found to be free of carbohydrate. Evidence that viral proteins span the lipid bilayer and interact with internal proteins has been obtained using several approaches (Lyles, 1979; Bowen and Lyles, 1981; Katz and Lodish, 1979) . These general structural features were therefore similar to those of other membranes such as that of the erythrocyte, in which the spatial arrangements of proteins and lipids were being elucidated in parallel. More recently, the complete three-dimensional structures of the external domains of two viral glycoproteins, influenza HA and neuraminidase, have been determined (Wilson et al., 1981; Varghese et al., 1983) . These and subsequent studies have provided great insight into structure-function relationships for viral membrane glycoproteins. Like cellular membrane glycoproteins, viral glycoproteins fall into several classes: type I proteins have a cleaved N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal hydrophobic anchor sequence, type I1 proteins are anchored to membranes by an uncleaved N-terminal signal-anchor sequence, and type I11 proteins have multiple membrane-spanning domains.",

In polarized epithelial cells, junctional complexes between adjacent cells divide the plasma membrane into two distinct domains, the apical and the basolateral domains. Enveloped viruses of some families, for example, influenza and paramyxoviruses, are found to bud exclusively at apical plasma membrane domains, whereas viruses of other families such as VSV and C-type retroviruses bud exclusively at basolateral membrane domains (Rodriguez-Boulan and Sabatini, 1978; Roth et al., 1983a) . The site of virus assembly reflects the site of expression of the viral envelope proteins; viral glycoproteins expressed in the absence of other viral components are targeted to the same membrane at which virus assembly occurs (Roth et al., 1983b; Jones et al., 1985) , so the site of expression of viral glycoproteins is likely to determine the site of virus assembly. Since nonglycosylated forms of viral glycoproteins that are produced in the presence of glycosylation inhibitors are correctly targeted to apical or basolateral plasma membranes (Roth et al., 1979) , the signals for protein targeting are apparently contained in specific amino acid sequences. Modification of the cytoplasmic tail of the influenza HA protein by introduction of a tyrosine residue resulted in redirection of the protein to basolateral membranes (Brewer and Roth, 1991) ; similar structural features of cytoplasmic domains have been implicated as basolateral targeting signals for several cellular glycoproteins (Rodriguez-Boulan and Powell, 1992) . In several cases these structural features resemble signals for endocytosis.",

These particles are replication defective; that is, they require the presence of standard wild-type viruses for their replication. When cells are co-infected with such defective particles and standard virus, the yield of infectious virus is significantly reduced. Thus, the defective particles interfere with the replication of infectious virus and are designated defective interfering (DI) particles. To avoid problems caused by their interference with replication, it is important to avoid the presence of high levels of DI particles when preparing virus stocks. This is easily accomplished by using a diluted virus inoculum to prepare virus stocks; for example, a multiplicity of infection of -0.1 infectious particles per cell. Under such conditions, DI particles and standard particles infect different cells and the DI particles are unable to replicate. Thus, as described in the following examples, virus stocks are usually prepared using a low multiplicity of infection and allowing multiple cycles of replication to occur.",

In contrast, enveloped viruses are relatively fragile, and it is necessary to store virus stocks below -60\u00b0C to maintain their infectivity. These viruses are also highly susceptible to inactivation during freezing and thawing; to stabilize their infectivity, a protein solution (usually bovine serum albumin, BSA) is added to virus stocks prior to freezing. Also, to minimize inactivation of infectivity, stocks are frozen in multiple small aliquots. Once an aliquot is thawed, it is used and any remainder is discarded. If a 37\u00b0C water bath is used for thawing an aliquot of stock virus, the virus should be removed and placed on ice as soon as it is thawed, since the halflife of some enveloped viruses at 37\u00b0C is as short as 1 hr.",

Studies with influenza virus have contributed greatly to our knowledge of membrane structure, folding and intracellular transport of membrane glycoproteins, the role of glycosylation in protein function, and virus-induced membrane fusion. The surface glycoprotein (G) of VSV, another enveloped virus, has also been used extensively in studies of structure-function relationships in membrane glycoproteins, and in studies of protein trafficking and membrane biogenesis. Additionally, as described earlier, these two viruses are assembled and released at distinct plasma membrane domains in polarized epithelial cells: influenza virus is assembled at the apical plasma membrane whereas VSV maturation occurs at the basolateral surface. Therefore, cells infected with VSV or influenza virus have provided attractive systems in which to study the molecular and cellular aspects of protein sorting in polarized cells.",

Important advances made with polio or other closely related viruses include the first demonstration of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (Baltimore et al., 1963) , the finding of base-paired double-stranded RNA that serves as an intermediate in replication (Montagnier and Sanders, 1963) , and the demonstration of cleavage of large polyprotein precursors in viral protein synthesis (Summers and Maizel, 1968) . The interaction of the virus with its cellular receptor has been studied in detail, as has the mechanism by which the virus alters host cell protein synthesis. In addition, studies in which poliovirus has been used as a vector for expression of foreign genes have been reported (Choi et al., 1991; Percy et al., 1992; Andino et al., 1993; Porter et al., 1993) .",

The genome consists of eight single-stranded RNA molecules that are packaged as helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes consisting of the vRNA, the nucleocapsid structural protein (NP, nucleoprotein), and a few copies of the viral P,, Pz, and P, (polymerase) proteins. The negative sense of the vRNA requires that a virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase be packaged in mature virions to initiate transcription after infection. The nucleocapsids are enclosed in a viral envelope containing two major surface glycoproteins, the HA and neuraminidase proteins, as well as the M2 protein that possesses ion channel activity. A major nonglycosylated protein, the matrix (MI ) protein, lines the inner surface of the viral envelope. In v i m , influenza virus preferentially infects cells of the upper respiratory tract, which possess sialic acidcontaining receptors.",

This process is followed by virus entry into the cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Release of the RNPs into the cytoplasm is thought to occur at secondary endoso-ma1 compartments by activation of the low pH-induced fusion activity of the HA protein, resulting in fusion of the viral envelope with endosomal membranes. Following their release from the virions, the RNPs are transported to the nucleus, where transcription of mRNA is initiated by the accompanying viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Two types of RNA transcripts are synthesized by the virus: mRNA and full length positive-strand RNA transcripts that are used as templates for replication of the negative-strand viral genome. Transcription of mRNA requires the presence of functional capped cellular mRNAs to serve as primers for the synthesis of viral mRNA (Krug et al., 1989) . The viral genome encodes 10 polypeptides, two of which are produced from spliced products of primary mRNA transcripts. Assembly of progeny virions occurs by budding at the plasma membrane. The neuraminidase (NA) plays a role in the final release of the virion from the cell surface (Palese et al., 1974 ).",

Influenza virus adsorbs to cells via its major surface glycoprotein, HA, which binds to N-acetylneuraminic acid residues present on target cells. The hemagglutination test takes advantage of the binding activity of viral HA to neuraminic acid-containing receptors found on red blood cells. Virus binds to these receptors and causes clumping or agglutination of red blood cells in suspension. However, this assay will not measure virus infectivity because defective particles or virus fragments that are not infectious also contain functional hemagglutinin proteins.",

The disrupted cells were collected from the plates, boiled for 5 min, sonicated for 20 sec to shear cellular DNA, and then stored at -20\u00b0C. Because influenza virus infection shuts off host cell protein synthesis, viral proteins can be directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE and processed for fluorography without prior immunoprecipitation of viral proteins with antiviral antiserum. For analysis of metabolically labeled viral proteins, aliquots of the cell lysates were separated on 13% polyacrylamide-SDS gels with an acry1amide:bis-acrylamide ratio of 130 : 1 (Lamb and Choppin, 1976) ; these conditions result in resolution of the M1 and NSl proteins which comigrate under standard acry1amide:bis-acrylamide ratios.

However, the incoming virion RNA is released into the cytoplasm where it functions as mRNA for initial viral protein synthesis (primary translation). Host cell protein synthesis is rapidly shut down between 1 and 2 hr postinfection as a result of disaggregation of cellular polyribosomes and their recruitment by viral RNA for synthesis of viral proteins. The genome of poliovirus encodes a large precursor polyprotein that undergoes subsequent cleavage, giving rise to the final viral protein species (Summers and Maizel, 1967; Leibowitz and Penman, 1971 ). Viral protein synthesis is readily detected beginning approximately 1.5 hr postinfection and reaches maximal levels at about 2.5 hr postinfection. Thereafter, protein synthesis levels off and begins to decline at 3.5 hr postinfection. Viral RNA synthesis is somewhat delayed after the onset of infection, after early viral protein synthesis has been initiated. Viral RNA synthesis is first detected between 1 and 2 hr postinfection and reaches a maximum at about 3 hr postinfection, declining considerably after 4 hr. Virus maturation is initiated by the association of vRNA with a newly synthesized viral proteins. Intracellular progeny virions are detectable between 3 and 4 hr postinfection. During virus maturation, the capsid proteins are assembled and precursor proteins are cleaved, resulting in the final virion coat proteins enclosing the vRNA genome. The assembly of infectious virions continues and large amounts accumulate in the cytoplasm until, at 6-8 hr postinfection, the progeny virions are released from the infected cell. A single cycle of virus growth is complete in about 8 hr (see Darnell and Levintow, 1960; Scharff et al., 1963 Scharff et al., ,1964 Baltimore et al., 1966; Levintow, 1974 ).",

            "text": "As described earlier, animal viruses have proven useful in studying mechanisms of vectorial transport of membrane proteins in polarized epithelial cells. It has been observed that VSV preferentially enters cells and is released by budding at the basolateral surfaces of polarized epithelial cells (e.g., MDCK, Vero C1008, and Caco-2 cells) (Rodriguez-Boulan and Sabatini, 1978; Tucker and Compans, 1993) . MDCK cells retain many of the properties of differentiated kidney epithelial cells (e.g., asymmetric distribution of enzymes and vectorial transport of sodium and water from apical to basolateral surfaces). Two strains of MDCK cells vary in their transepithelial resistance (Richardson et al., 1981; Balcarova-Stander et al., 1984) . Strain I forms tight epithelial monolayers reaching a transepithelial resistance above 1500 ohm cm2, whereas Strain I1 forms monolayers with lower resistance of 200-300 ohm cm2. For studies of virus infection of polarized cells, the cells are usually grown on permeable supports (filters) that facilitate access to both the apical and the basolateral surfaces. We typically use 3-cm diameter filters of mixed cellulose esters (Millicell-HA, 0.45-pm pores, Millipore, Bedford, MA). With filters of a pore size greater than 1 pm, epithelial cells can migrate through the filter (Tucker et al., 1992) . Thus, filters with pore size of >1 p m are recommended.",

Follow the manufacturer's instructions when using this instrument. Resistance is measured at room temperature in medium without serum. Make sure the medium is at room temperature and the electrodes are sterile (soak in 70% EtOH). When moving the electrodes from one filter-grown monolayer to the next, rinse with PBS, if necessary, and avoid touching the membrane with the internal electrode. As a control, the resistance of the growth medium plus membrane support without cells is measured; this value is subtracted from the reading obtained with cells. Use of nonpolarized epithelial cells for comparison is highly encouraged. Cell monolayers can also be monitored for impermeability to diffusion of a macromolecule across the cell layer by using [3H]inulin (Caplan et al., 1986) .
