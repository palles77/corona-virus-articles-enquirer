            "text": "In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of an unknown cause were detected in Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus, later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000 patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible-or the virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.",

            "text": "In December 2019, several patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were identified in Wuhan, China. 1 The results of genome sequencing, released on 10 January 2020, showed that the pneumonia outbreak was related to a new coronavirus, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), whose genetic sequence is homologous to that of the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 2 Coronaviruses are enveloped with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and with a nucleocapsid. 3 Although the 2019-nCoV is a new coronavirus, it has characteristics common to other coronaviruses, such as sensitivity to heat (it can be inactivated after 30 minutes at 56 \u2022 C), diethyl ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, and chloroform. 4 Further genetic and amino acid sequencing of the S-protein of 2019-nCoV established that the receptorbinding domain of the S-protein binds to recipient cells and interacts strongly with human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor molecules. 2 This finding shows that the underlying pathogenesis of the virus is to infect the human respiratory epithelium through the S-protein-ACE2 binding pathway. The sequencing from isolated 2019-nCoV became available to the World Health Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020, 5 and the genomic sequence substantially facilitated the development of real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays to detect the virus.",

The median age of the infected patients was 47 years (interquartile range [IQR], 41.0-58.0), and the median time from onset to admission was 7 days (IQR, 4.0-8.0). Severely ill patients may have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, secondary infection, septic shock, and acute kidney injury. Laboratory findings include lymphopenia, leucopenia, elevated concentrations of procalcitonin, serum amyloid A, D-dimer, and hypersensitive troponin and longer prothrombin times. 7 The 2019-nCoV epidemic is suspected to be highly similar to other highly threatening coronavirus diseases such as SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), both intensely infectious diseases related to animals. 2, 3 Like with other epidemics, health systems need to respond quickly and accurately to control the spread of the virus. Here, we describe our understanding of the 2019-nCoV epidemic and our experience with other coronavirus-related diseases in West China Hospital. Based on this, we aim to establish a precision medicine approach to managing Wuhan coronavirus pneumonia, starting from accurate and rapid recognition of individuals infected by 2019-nCoV. It will facilitate decision-making by health care workers with necessary clinical information, laboratory detection, and imaging findings. The approach consists of the following four parts: screening, diagnosis, preventive control, and treatment of 2019-CoV pneumonia (Fig. 1) . Given our clinical experience in preventing and treating various viral pneumonia, including those caused by coronaviruses, we believe that such an approach would help in preventing further the spreading of 2019-nCoV.",

In the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2002 and 2003, more than 8000 people were infected and 916 died. 10 Subsequently, by 28 February 2018, 2066 confirmed cases were attributed to MERS-CoV while more than 720 deaths were reported. 10 Patients with SARS or MERS infections present with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from upper respiratory tract infection to ARDS, whereas other HCoVs cause severe lower respiratory tract infection, primarily in the elderly and neonates. 10 Currently, the most common diagnostic method of coronaviruses is molecular detection. 10 A precision medicine approach is crucial to quickly confirm the diagnosis with laboratory methods, control the spread of the virus, and better allocate hospital resources.",

As compared to the 2 months spent before the first report of SARS case in Foshan Guangdong Province in 2002, 17, 18 the 2019-nCoV infection was reported to the WHO China Office on 31 December 2019, less than 1 month after the first few sporadic cases. 19 Although many questions, such as detailed pathogenic characteristics, remain unanswered, from what we know about other coronavirus infections, the behavior of 2019-nCoV is not unusual. To reduce the incidence of infection as well as prevent nosocomial infections, we have been working to establish a precision medicine approach for screening, diagnostic, in-hospital preventive control, and treatment for individual patients. With this approach, West China Hospital identified 14 infected patients immediately, each of whom was treated according to the approach developed by the multi-disciplinary medical team. By the time this paper was published, one patient was clinically cured (negative nucleic acid test result for throat swab), while other patients' vital signs remained stable. Since then, the precautionary measures for prevention, control, and quarantine have been implemented and no cases of human-to-human transmission or infection of the medical staff have happened in our hospital.",
