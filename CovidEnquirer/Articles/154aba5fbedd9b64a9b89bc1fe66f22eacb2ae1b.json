However, there are few direct comparisons of different PCR assays. This study compares 4 different multiplex PCR assays for the recovery of common respiratory viruses. We tested 213 respiratory specimens using four different multiplex PCR assays: the xTAG respiratory viral panel fast (Abbott Molecular Laboratories), Fast-track Respiratory Pathogen assay (Fast-track Diagnostics), Easyplex respiratory pathogen 12 kit (Ausdiagnostics), and an in-house multiplex real-time PCR assay. The performance of the four assays was very similar, with 93-100% agreement for all comparisons. Other issues, such as through-put, technical requirements and cost, are likely to be as important for making a decision about which of these assays to use given their comparative performance.",

The increased sensitivity of PCR over classical methods is well established (Murdoch et al., 2010) while the detection of newly discovered respiratory pathogens, the human bocavirus, (Schenk et al., 2007) and rhinovirus type C (Dominguez et al., 2008) , contributes to the improved diagnostic yield. The increasing acceptance of nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs) and the development of high through-put assay platforms have changed how the modern diagnostic laboratory operates. For the detection of respiratory viruses, the emphasis has now shifted from cell culture-based methods and viral antigen detection to the use of PCR as standard methodology. (Kuypers et al., 2006; Ganzenmueller et al., 2010; Mahony et al., 2007) The technique also allows quantitation of pathogens (Heim et al., 2003; Jansen et al., 2011; Ward et al., 2004) and PCR amplified products can be used for genetic sequencing (Monto et al., 2006) .",

The selection of an assay is dependent on variables such as the range of pathogens detected, expected work-load and workflow, financial resources, clinical requirements, staff expertise and the laboratory's ability to perform assay validations. A variety of commercial and in-house PCR assays are now available that use multiplexing technology which has simplified workflows and significantly reduced processing times (Gunson et al., 2008) . Multiplex PCR, as described in this publication, refers to the simultaneous amplification of multiple sequences in a single reaction.

The predominant influenza A virus strain detected was A(H1N1)pdm 2009. Only 4 isolates were identified as the A(H1N1) seasonal strain circulating up to mid-2009, and one was A(H3N2). The majority of picornaviruses detected were rhinoviruses; the FTD assay was the only assay to differentiate rhinovirus within the picornavirus family. Analysis of the internal control results, for each assay revealed no PCR inhibition in the FTD, IH PCR or EP assays., However inhibition was detected in 11 samples by MS2 PCR in the xTAG RVP assay. Of these 11 inhibited samples, 5 were sputum and 4 had a pathogen detected which indicates issues with the sample matrix and the MS2 PCR.",

The agreement between these assays for influenza A, RSV, the parainfluenza viruses, picornaviruses, adenoviruses, HMPV, coronaviruses and human bocavirus ranged between 93.0% and 100%. The highest analytical agreement was for the detection of influenza A and RSV (between 97.7% and 100%). While good agreement was also seen for the detection of the parainfluenza viruses and coronavirus, limited numbers of samples containing these viruses were tested and therefore further evaluation would be useful to confirm these observations. Variation was seen in the analytical agreement for pathogen detection between individual assays. The EP assay correlated poorly with the other assays for the detection of adenovirus, with Kappa values of 0.39 for xTAG RVP, 0.45 for FTD, and 0.53 for the in-house assay. Seven samples were positive with the EP assay only and it may be inferred that the EP assay was producing false positive adenovirus results in this sample series. A possible explanation is that the EP assay uses a non-specific DNA binding dye with melt curve analysis and therefore poor primer design would produce non-specific PCR products. Similarly, xTAG RVP had only moderate agreement for picornavirus detection with the Kappa values of 0.75 for FTD, 0.8 for EP and 0.86 for the in-house assay, although the in-house assay was restricted to rhinovirus detection only. This difference could be due to the increased sensitivity of the xTAG PCR (which detected picornavirus in 44 samples) or that certain strains were not detected by the primers used in the other assays. More than 150 different rhinoviruses exist and it would be difficult to design primers that can detect all strains with the same PCR efficiencies; Faux et al., has recently shown that optimal rhinovirus detection requires two primer sets (Faux et al., 2011) . The least agreement between assays was seen for human bocavirus with a Kappa value 0.486 for the FTD assay versus xTAG RVP. The Kappa value was zero for the EP versus the xTAG RVP and FTD assays, which did not detect bocavirus in this series of samples. These low values could be due to specificity and sensitivity issues and further investigation is required to establish whether the FTD and xTAG RVP assay produces false positive results or the EP assays produce false negative results due to strain variation.",

A limitation of this study was that it was carried out over a period when the (H1N1)pdm 09 virus was dominant. Thus we could not comment on the ability of these assays to detect some pathogens e.g. influenza B, HMPV, as they were not present or only detected in small numbers, and therefore further studies are required. We noted that differences do occur in assay detection rates that may reflect the expected assay variability caused by selection of gene target, analytical sensitivity, differences in equipment and reagents such as enzymes.",

In our comparison, the xTAG RVP assay required 4 h for amplification and analysis however it could process 96 samples including controls in a single run, offering high volume throughput during an 8 h working day (Gadsby et al., 2010) . The xTAG RVP is an open system assay that requires the operator to handle PCR product during the product detection step. The FTD and IH PCR each require 2.5 h for amplification and result analysis. They are realtime PCR assays that can be run on three widely used systems. The FTD and IH PCR assay require significant hands-on time to set-up the PCR plates but these steps could be semi-automated using an automated pipetting platform, leading to a reduced labour requirement. The FTD and in-house PCR assays have a moderate sample through-put; each can process12 samples per run, with up to 4 runs in an eight hour day. Extra capacity could be obtained by using 384 rather than 96 well plates. An advantage of these real-time PCR formats is that they are closed systems and do not require operator manipulation of PCR products as the amplification, product detection, and quantitation steps are all combined in a single reaction. The EP assay is based on the nested PCR principle in which the first round is the RT-PCR which is followed by second round of PCR. This PCR is called multiplex tandem PCR (MT-PCR) (Stanley and Szewczuk, 2005) . Six samples can be processed in 2 h, representing a low through-put capacity, although this can be increased by the addition of an extra real time PCR thermal cycler. An advantage of the xTAG RVP and EP systems was that results were automatically generated whereas the FTD and IH assay outputs required complex manual analysis to generate results.",

The xTAG RVP although detecting the influenza A on the matrix gene target was the only assay not to have updated primers for the typing of the new A(H1N1)pdm 2009 variant and an influenza A untypeable result indicated this strain (Ginocchio and St George, 2009 ). This highlights a major limitation of the commercial assays; updating primer and probe sequences once an assay has been marketed is problematic. In contrast, the in-house assay is flexible in design and can be rapidly modified. Its disadvantage is that standardisation is difficult because there are many variables in the PCR work-flow, all of which can impact on assay performance.",
