Coal liquids have been evaluated in a variety of short-term toxicological assays; however, few studies have been conducted to determine the systemic effects after inhalation exposure to these materials. To extend the data base on potential health effects from coal liquefaction materials, we performed a study with solvent refined coal (SRC)-II heavy distillate (HD). Fischer-344 rats were exposed for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week for 5 or 13 weeks to an aerosol of HD (boiling range, 288 to 454\u00b0C) at concentrations of 0.69, 0.14, 0.03, or 0.0 mg/liter of air for the high, middle, low, and control groups, respectively. Survival through 13 weeks of exposure was greater than 90% for all groups; body weights for exposed animals were decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Significant increases in liver weights and decreases in thymus and ovary weights were observed for treated animals compared with controls. There were also significant treatment-related decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, volume of packed red blood cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and total white blood cells. After 5 weeks of exposure serum cholesterol concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner for both sexes and serum triglyceride amounts decreased for males but not for females. After 13 weeks of exposure, high-dose animals had significant increases in cholesterol (males only), triglycerides, blood urea nitrogen, and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT; males) and significant decreases in albumin, SGPT (females), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Examination of bone-marrow preparations from exposed animals demonstrated consistent decreases in the degree of cellularity, suggesting that this organ is a target for HD. Microscopic evaluation of organ sections indicated exposurerelated changes for nasal mucosa, pulmonary macrophages, thymus, liver, kidney, bone marrow, ovaries, and cecum. Results from this study indicated dose-dependent increases in the severity of the lesions observed, with few effects in the low-exposure group that were attributable to the exposure. 0 1986 Academic Press, Inc.",

Moreover, these materials are also active in mammalian-cell mutation and transformation assays (Frazier and Andrews, 1983; Frazier and Mahlum, 1984) . In addition to these in vitro assays, which are often used to screen materials for potential carcinogenicity, mouse skin-painting assays demonstrated that both PS and HD were carcinogenic (Mahlum, 1983; Renne et al., 198 1) . In other studies with low-and middle-boiling-range materials, neither mutagenic (Pelroy and Petersen, 198 1) nor carcinogenic activity (Renne et al., 1981) was observed.",

The sample was collected on April 3 and 4, 1980 during operation in the SRC-II mode using Powhatan No. 6 coal and was stored at 4\u00b0C under nitrogen in Teflon-lined drums. Samples of the stored material were recently evaluated for changes in chemical composition and mutagenicity to determine if changes had occurred since this study was conducted, between April and July 1982. These data indicate that the composition and biological activity for HD have remained constant for up to 4 years after collection .",

Comparison of the material used in this study with those of other studies provides a better perspective to our data. Carpenter et al. ( 1977) conducted a series of subchronic inhalation exposures to determine the effects of petroleum hydrocarbons. For those studies, aerosol concentrations ranged between 0.1 and 10 mg/liter. The materials boiled from 66\" to 260\u00b0C which was considerably lower than the boiling range for HD. Those petroleum-derived hydrocarbons were of lower molecular weight than our material and the aromatic portion was composed of a high percentage of alkylated benzene compounds. Significant biological effects attributable to the test material were rare and usually not dose related. For the 16 materials that they evaluated, there is little evidence for effects on survival, growth, tissue weights, hematology, or clinical pathology, even though the concentrations for most of the exposures were considerably higher than those in our study.",

            "text": "Comparison of the effects seen with HD to those known to occur following exposure to individual compounds present in HD revealed both similarities and differences in the observed toxic effects. For example, exposure of animals to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) at a dose of approximately 100 mg/kg resulted in decreased numbers of primary oocytes in the ovaries (Mat&n and Thotgeitsson, 1979 ) and hypocellularity of the bone marrow, followed by aplastic anemia (Nebert and Jensen, 1979) . For comparison, we estimated the amount of HD deposited in the lung of the rat during inhalation exposure and calculated the weight of benzene, BaP, and PAH received by each rat per day of the exposure. Assuming a minute volume of 150 ml (Guyton, 1947) , and that one-half the inhaled material was deposited in the lung or gastrointestinal tract, a 6hr exposure to the high concentration (0.69 mg/liter) would result in a dose of about 60 mg/kg body v&/day. Since benzene and BaP are present in HD at 0.016 and 0.055%, the animal would receive about 0.010 and 0.034 mg/kg/day, respectively, a daily dose much lower than that observed to produce effects on bone marrow and oocytes. However, PAH other than BaP could produce similar kinds of effects. The PAH fraction of HD is composed primarily of parent and alkylated threeto six-fused-ring compounds, i.e., phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene, and benzopyrene. Major nitrogen-containing PAH present in HD are parent and alkylated three-to fivefused-ring systems based on the carbazole and quinoline structures. Since the neutral PAH represents about 46% of the HD (Wilson et al., 1984) , the estimated dose of PAH was 28 mg/kg/day, indicating that it is near the range of a single dose of BaP known to result in effects on the ovary and bone marrow. The amount of PAH taken in by the animal through the skin or ingested because of grooming was not measured and therefore not considered in the calculation; it is possible that this noninhaled dose may make a significant contribution to the total exposure.",

Comparison of these effects with those observed following exposure to other lighter hydrocarbon mixtures indicated that the type of lesions produced by HD were dissimilar. For example, Bruner ( 1983) reported that inhalation exposure to jet fuel (JP-5) produced dilated and cystic renal tubules filled with eosinophilic granular debris near the corticomedullary junction. This lesion was observed only in male rats. The renal tubular epithelium had increased eosinophilic cytoplasmic droplets and was compressed in areas where there was abundant tubular debris. Tubular regeneration was also observed, and renal papillary epithelial hyperplasia was present in animals held 20 months after exposure. In another study, Phillips (1983) reported that Stoddard solvent produced (in male rats only) signs similar to those reported for JP-5. The types of kidney lesions observed by those and other workers (Carpenter et al., 1977; Gaworski et al., 1983; Halder et al., 1984; Phillips and Egan, 1984; Phillips and Cockrell, 1984) were produced by hydrocarbon mixtures boiling between 60 and 220\u00b0C; the effect appears to be due to branched chain alinhatics and cvclonaraffinic comoounds.",

A contributing cause of anemia might be blood loss from cecal ulceration. Bone marrow preparations collected from animals immediately after 13-weeks exposure demonstrated substantial reductions, relative to controls, in the degree of cellularity, suggesting that components of HD produced adverse effects on marrow stem cells. The lack of megakaryocytes in spleen and in bone marrow sections as well as bone marrow smears was further evidence of toxicity to stem cells. After a 6month recovery period, values for erythrocyte parameters had nearly returned to control values.",

Decreased number of leukocytes after 13 weeks of exposure might be the result of reduced lymphopoiesis; however, a contributing cause may be reductions mediated by increased amounts of adrenal corticosteroids due to chronic stress. This latter speculation is supported by the fact that the numbers of eosinophils, another cell type susceptible to corticosteroids, were also significantly reduced.",

For comparison, 0.03 mg/liter is six times the threshold limit value (TLV) for exposure to nuisance dust and a factor of 150 times greater than the TLV for coal tar pitch volatiles (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, 197 I). Even though inhalation exposure to HD clearly results in systemic effects in rats, conformance to limits similar to those for coal tar pitch volatiles should result in human doses below those which we have found to cause effects in animals.",
