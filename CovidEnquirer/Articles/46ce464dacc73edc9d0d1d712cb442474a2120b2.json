Most TGEV isolates produced a typical cytopathic effect (CPE) in swine testis (ST) cell culture, which included a ballooning or lifting away of the infected ceils from the cell monolayer with heavy granulation evident. Minor variations in CPE were observed with one isolate, IA-145. Protein profiles of the TGEV isolates as determined by SDS-PAGE were essentially identical, with the exception of the isolate IA-101. The TGEV isolate IA-101 presented a higher molecular mass M protein and lacked an N protein doublet that was present in all other TGEV isolates. The TGEV isolates were shown to be closely related antigenically by using hyperimmune sera in a virus neutralization (VN) test. Some antigenic diversity was detected by utilizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in a VN test. Titers of the mAbs were highest with the homologous Miller TGEV, and one virus isolate, IA-156, was very poorly neutralized with the mAbs used in this study. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) results were similar to those obtained by the VN test. These studies show that some biologic and antigenic diversity exists among TGEV isolates.",

The transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), belongs to the Coronaviridae family of viruses. TGEV has three structural viral proteins, these being M, S, and N (Garwes et al., 1976; Saif and Bohl, 1986) . M is glycosylated with an apparent Mr of 25000-28000 and is associated with the viral envelope (Saif and Bohl, 1986) . S, the spike protein, has an apparent Mr of 200000 and is also glycosylated (Garwes et al., 1976) . The N protein is not glycosylated, has an apparent molecular mass of 45000, and is also associated with the binding of viral RNA and serves as a nucleocapsid (Britton et al., 1988) . S is the viral protein that induces neutralizing antibodies (Garwes et al., 1978 (Garwes et al., / 1979 .",

It has been thought for many years that only one serotype of TGEV exists (Kemeny, 1976) . However, antigenic variation among TGEV isolates has been demonstrated (Hohdatsu et al., 1987; Laude et al., 1986; Zhu et al., 1990) . Another point to consider is the extent of biological variation among TGEV isolates.

The Miller strain of TGEV was used as a comparative standard for the protein migration of the TGEV isolates. The TGEV isolates and mock-infected cells were labeled with 35Smethionine-cysteine and processed as follows. Four-day-old ST cells in 25 cm 2 flasks were infected at a m.o.i, of 0.1 pfu/cell and incubated at 37\u00b0C. At 16 hours p.i., the medium was replaced with methionine-free MEM and the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for one hour. The medium was replaced with fresh methionine-free MEM with 250 #Ci/m135S-methionine-cysteine added. Four hours after the addition of the 35S-methionine-cysteine, the cell monolayers were scraped from the plastic flask and pelleted by centrifugation at 200\u00d7g for 10 rain. The cellular pellets containing labeled viral proteins were then disrupted with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM NaC1, 50 mM tris, 5raM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysis buffer and cellular pellet mixtures were vortexed vigorously for 1 min, and placed on ice for 3 min. The remaining cellular residues were removed by centrifugation. The lysates were stored at -20 \u00b0 C until needed. One hundred and fifty pl of the appropriate lysate was mixed with 4/A of ascitic fluid containing mAb or 3 #1 of undiluted swine polyclonal anti-Miller TGEV hypedmmune serum and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Immune complexes were then collected by the addition of sepharose beads coated with protein A (Sigma, St., Louis, MO.), and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The antigenantibody complexes/protein A sepharose beads mixtures were then washed three times with lysis buffer and then three times with deionized distilled water, resuspended in 50 pl sample buffer, and run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described by Zhu et al.

Welch and Saif (1988 ) demonstrated the presence of this protein and felt that the presence of the N' may be related to the level of attenuation or cell adaptation of the virus, since in their study the high-passaged Purdue strain exhibited more of the N' protein. To confirm this report, the virulent gut-passaged Miller CHV TGEV was included in the protein profile studies. All the isolates tested in this study, with the exception of the isolate IA-101, exhibited a N doublet with Mr of 44000 and a 42000 respectively. The levels of the N' protein detected by RIP for either the Miller or Purdue strains were essentially the same. Also, the isolate IA-156 has been inoculated into gnotobiotic piglets and was found to be a virulent TGEV isolate that produced profuse diarrhea with extensive villous atrophy in the small intestine (unpublished data). The fact that both the virulent gut-passaged Miller CHV TGEV and a virulent field isolate both produced a N doublet casts doubt on the hypothesis that the presence of such a doublet is correlated to the level of attenuation or the virulence of that particular isolate. Britton et al. ( 1988 ) published the sequence of the N protein gene of a virulent TGEV field isolate from Britain, and analysis of this sequence revealed that the open reading frame was predicted to code for a protein with a Mr of 43426. This predicted protein mass is very similar to the N proteins of the TGEV isolates in this study that had a Mr of approximately 44000. Whether the additional N protein is a precursor or degradation product of the 44000 Mr N protein is not known. In the two studies that have presented evidence of a N protein doublet, a relatively low m.o.i, of TGEV isolates was used to infect ST cells. We have used a m.o.i, of 0.1 pfu/cell, and Welch and Saif ( 1988 ) utilized a m.o.i, of 0.02 to 0.04 pfu/cell. Other reports in which the presence of a N protein doublet was not evident, such as Laude et al. (1986) and Zhu et al. (1990) , a higher m.o.i, of 50 or 100 pfu/cell was used respectively. A high m.o.i, ensures that all viable cells are infected at the same time, and the viral replication and viral protein synthesis are synchronized. However, when a low m.o.i, is used, several viral replicative cycles must occur before all the cells are infected and viral protein synthesis is occurring simultaneously. Since both studies that present evidence of an N protein doublet used a low m.o.i., it is interesting to speculate that the 42000 Mr N' protein product may be a degradation product of the 44000 Mr N protein and thus may accumulate in higher concentrations under low m.o.i, conditions. Pulse chase studies utilizing a low m.o.i, may prove beneficial in providing evidence to support this claim.",

            "text": "Antigenic diversity was evidenced by the results of VN tests, IFA, and in the case of IA-156, by RIP. It has generally been accepted that there is only one serotype of TGEV. The evidence for there being one serotype of TGEV is based on the work of Kemeny (1976) where a 32 fold difference in neutralization titers with polyclonal sera was used as an endpoint with homologous and heterologous sera for determination of serotypes. In this study, VN with polyclonal antibodies revealed 2 to 8 fold differences when tested against homologous and heterologous TGEV isolates. The results of this study using polyclonal sera agree with the statement that there is one serotype of TGEV. However, differences among TGEV isolates detected with mAbs has been re-ported by other researchers (Welch and Saif, 1988; Hohdatsu et al., 1987; Laude et al., 1986; Zhu et al., 1990) . In this study, 2 to 2048 fold differences were detected with neutralizing mAbs directed to the S glycoprotein of the TGEV. These differences may reflect varying concentrations of the epitopes on the TGEV isolates that are recognized by the mAbs used in this study. The isolate IA-156 was not neutralized by the mAbs MH11, MA4, or MAS. The IFA and RIP data confirmed these results. The RIP with mAb MH 11 showed that the isolate IA-156 lacked the epitope that mAb MH 11 recognized, as there was no detectable S glycoprotein band precipitated. If the isolate IA-156 had contained the epitope recognized by mAb MH11 and still was not neutralized, the possibility that the epitope was inaccessible or was present in very low concentration on IA-156 could have been considered, but the RIP with mAb MH 11 disproved this possibility.",

The significance of the lack of reactivity of IA-156 with neutralizing mAbs is not clear. Almost all TGEV field isolates thus far reported are to some extent neutralized by mAbs. Additional studies are needed to determine if IA-156 is missing other epitopes that are present on other TGEV isolates.",
