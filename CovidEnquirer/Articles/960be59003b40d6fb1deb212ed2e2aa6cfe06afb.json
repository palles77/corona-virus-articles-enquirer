The bacterium was detected by Gram stain in 52.4% of 149 cecal samples and iota-like toxin in 7.4%. From 29 strains of C. spiroforme tested, 26 were toxigenic, originating from 24 of 29 rabbitries. In 13.4% of the samples, C. spiroforme was present as the only known disease agent. Gross and microscopic lesions were similar to those described in the literature. In the other samples, C. spiroforme was associated with attaching effacing Escherichia coli (29.5%), Bacillus piliformis (10.3%), rotaviruses (25.6%), coronavirus (2.6%), Eimeria spp. (44.9%) and cryptosporidia (6.4%). In 33.3% of C. spiroforme-containing samples, more than one of these agents was present. There was no significant difference between the presence of these organisms in C. spiroforme-positive and negative samples. On the basis of these results as well as that of previous data, we suggest that C. spiroformemediated diarrhea is favoured by maldigestion, initiated by infectious agents and/or nutritional factors.",

Since the recognition of C. spiroforme as the etiologic agent in iota enterotoxemia, simple isolation methods have been developed (Borriello and Carman, 1983) ; therefore we decided to study the significance of C. spiroforme in the enteritis-complex of commercial rabbits and its possible relationship with other pathogens.",

A total of 32 C. spiroforme-like strains was isolated and stored in standard Robertson's cooked meat medium. Presumptive C. spiroforme strains with typical loosely-coiled morphology as seen by Gram stain could not be separated from contaminants in samples containing <103 spores g-1. PAGE confirmed identity between outer membrane proteins of 25 isolates and those of the reference strain of C. spiroforme NCTC 11493. Four strains grew insufficiently and were not tested. Rocket immuno-electrophoresis of 48-h BHI peptone glucose salts culture filtrates showed the presence of iotalike toxins in 26 cultures, including the cultures from the four strains which could not be tested by PAGE. So, it can be assumed that 29 isolates of 32 were in fact C. spiroforme. Three of the 29 isolates were not toxigenic.",

The perineum and hind legs of these 20 rabbits were extensively soiled by liquid feces. At necropsy of these animals, the small intestine was dilated and contained a colourless to light yellowish liquid. In two animals, the small intestine was moderately congested. Cecal contents were watery (16/20). In animals killed in extremis, cecal contents were blood-stained (3/20): blood-stained cecal contents filtrates were toxic to mice. The cecal wall was thickened in five animals and showed paintbrush hemorrhages on the serosa of two animals; in the latter the proximal colon was congested. Mesenteric lymph nodes were moderately to severely swollen. Kidneys were pale and swollen in eight animals. Similar lesions were also established in animals with mixed infections.

The resulting maldigestion changes the composition of the substrate available to the intestinal flora which may be disrupted.

This hypothesis may be supported by following findings: C. spiroforme is seldom present in healthy rabbits (Borriello and Carman, 1983) , although the organism is present in most rabbitries; in 78 cases of C. spiroforme-associated diarrhea, C. spiroforme was present as the only known infectious agent in only 26%; experimental infection with C. spiroforme only causes diarrhea if the infection coincides with a stress factor such as weaning or with the administration of some antibiotics (Lamont et al., 1979; Rehg and Pakes, 1982; Borriello and Carman, 1983) .
