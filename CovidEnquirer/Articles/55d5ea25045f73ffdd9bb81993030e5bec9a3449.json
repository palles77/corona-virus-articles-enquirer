The aim was to find out a method for a quantitative evaluation of the health level in farms selling young breeders. An exhaustive protocol was prepared for data collection. The sources of information were clinical inspections on the farms, meat inspection data at slaughter and laboratory investigations. Data processing issued in the selection of a profile made of 14 prevailing health indicators. These were then associated so as to set up a health index with an overall score. In a second phase, the relevance of the method with respect to disease transmission was assessed. The principle was a contact challenge within totally controlled facilities between SPF pigs hysterectomy-derived and gilts taken from farms with different health scores as previously checked. The contact lasted for 28 days. Eleven farms were chosen and in every one of them 7 gilts were sampled and 10 SPF pigs were assigned to each of these farms. All the pigs were submitted to a detailed observation. At the end of it the pigs were euthanized at the laboratory and checked to find out any lesions and infectious agents. A wide range of symptoms appeared among the SPF pigs. Mortality rate was 14.6%. Pneumonia affected 23.7% of them. A relationship was found between the germ transfer and the severity of the troubles. The degree of illness in SPF pigs was clearly related to the score obtained previously in the corresponding farms. Consequently, the method was considered as valid with respect to health evaluation.",

            "text": "To measure health standards is a delicate task for an epidemiologist whatever the species concerned. With humans, the problem of selecting accurate and reliable criteria has been underlined many times (Feinstein, 1977 , Holland et at. 1979 , Wagner et al. 1983 . For this purpose, the concept of health indicators has been widely used (Hetzel, 1972, Jenicek and Cleroux, 1982) . The approach is also available for farm animals and, therefore, health requirements have to be defined and listed (Drummond, 1989) . The question of health evaluation is of particular importance in farms selling new replacement stock. As regards pigs, the onset of breeding pyramids with a wide spread of gilts and boars from a limited number of specialized nucleus herds emphasize the need for measuring health in these herds. Descriptions of health statuses of farms have been proposed (Goodwin and Whittlestone, 1983, Muirhead, 1989) . The evaluation must not be confined to the microbial agents that can be detected. Nevertheless, these are usually granted great interest in health monitoring (Alexander, 1986 , Skovgaard, 1987 . Health evaluation methods consist in binary responses for specific health indicators taken one by one rather than in a figure giving an overall quantitative evaluation for the health profile. Furthermore, such measurements can hardly ever be judged as reliable through experimentation. This paper presents a method of scoring health in nucleus and multiplier pig farms obtained from a field study. Then, it describes an experimental trial undertaken as a validating challenge.",

Concurrently, the most relevant parameters for this purpose were determined. The statistical process was performed with the use of descriptive multivariate methods, namely correspondence analysis and a cluster analysis (Lebart et al. 1985 , Jambu et al. 1983 . At the end of the statistical process, a combination of fourteen variables (health indicators) was retained to classify the farms according to their health status and a typology could be concluded (Madec et al. 1990 ). Some of the health indicators derive from the association of 2 or more criteria. They are listed in Table 1 . Furthermore, each of the health indicators was divided into 3 levels respecting the sense of the relationship with health. Then, they were used to establish an ultimate health score. Health indicators with a low, medium or high level were given respectively an elementary score of zero, one or two. Afterwards the elementary scores were added up so as to obtain a global score for health, ranging theorically from zero (the 14 indicators at low level) to 28 (all at the high level ).",

A contact trial was suggested between gilts taken from breeding or multiplier pig farms previously checked for health using the method described above and hysterectomy-derived SPF piglets. The design of the experimental contact trial is demonstrated in Fig. 1 . The experimentation was conducted in totally isolated rooms. Each room was equipped with 2 flat decks with perforated floors and sides partially open. \u2022 Feeding: the same pelleted food was provided ad lib. throughout the trial. \u2022 The farms: gilts from 11 farms were tested. These farms did not participate to phase A. The managers of breeding pyramids that accepted to take part in the trial were first asked to give us an initial idea of the profile of the farms candidates. All the pigs from these farms had to be individually and systematically identified at birth on routine basis (Tattoo). Provisional groups of farms were made with respect to health. Then a random selection was undertaken within these groups. The selected farms were widely scattered all over the North-West of France. Their health was checked up just before the contact trial started. \u2022 The gilts: On the farms, batches of pigs weighing around 75-85 kg live weight were considered for the choice of the individuals that were to be transferred to the research station. Pigs showing obvious signs of illness or those with a low liveweight were eliminated. Among the others, gilts estimated to be fit for sale were submitted to random selection. They were weighed, and transferred to the experimental facilities in a perfectly clean and disinfected lorry. On average, they were 141 days old (SD: 19 days) at a liveweight of 79.4 kg (SD: 4.5 kg). \u2022 The piglets: The piglets used in this trial came from the SPF herd at the \"Station de Pathologie Porcine\" in Ploufragan. At the beginning of the challenge, they weighed 30.3 kg, on average, at 60 days of age SD: 6 days). \u2022 Duration of the challenge: For each farm, the contact period lasted 28 days. \u2022 Statistical procedures: The data, concerning the prevalences obtained in the (Mengeling, 1992) Serology ELISA (Nicolet and Paroz, 1980) Culture (Avril, 1989) ELISA (Foged et al. 1988) Culture (Michel-Briand, 1989) Culture (Dabernet and Sanson-Le-Pors, 1989 Culture (Avril, 1989) Culture (Hommez et al. 1986) Culture (Ellis etal. 1976) Coproscopy (Coles, 1974) different groups of piglets, were compared by chi-square. The weight gains were compared by the t test. \u2022 Clinical observations and laboratory examinations: rectal temperature, fecal consistency, respiratory signs (sneezing, coughing, etc. ), locomotor disorders and any other particular anomalies were recorded day by day. Weekly food intake was recorded for each flat-deck. Blood samples were taken from every pig on the first day, and then, every 7 days. The sera were tested against pseudorabies, swine Influenza, Porcine respiratory coronavirus, Transmissible gastroenteritis, Porcine Epidemic Diarrohea, porcine parvorirus and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. At the beginning of the trial, nasal swabs were taken for bacteriology and faeces were examined for parasites and salmonellae. At the end of the period (28 days ), all the pigs were euthanasied and then, according to a standard protocol, necropsied and sampled for further laboratory testing (bacteriology and parasitology, Table 2 ). Respiratory tract lesions were scored at necropsy, on scales according to Madec et al. 1988 . Pigs dying in the course of the trial were weighed and a similar procedure was carded out in a thorough examination for lesions plus appropriate microbiology.",

This kind of multifactorial disease has a major economic impact on the pig industry. The problem is that most of the pathogens involved in such diseases are widely spread in the breeding pyramids and it is assumed that the diseases can be transmitted by pigs from herds harbouring the pathogens even though subclinical troubles only are present in the selling farms (BackstrSm and Hoefling, 1986, De Jong and Nielsen, 1990 ).

The idea put forward being that disease is all the more likely to be transmitted as the amount of microbes transferred is high. According to the authors, the health level can be assessed through the measurement of direct health indicators (mortality rate, clinical signs, etc. ) but also indirectly through the evaluation of the degree of exposure to particular circumstances that have been proved to be linked to a given disease (Jenicek and Cleroux, 1982 ) . Most of the parameters here included in the index are direct health indicators. To elaborate a parameter in order to find out how vulnerable the farms are to viral epidemics is also -though indirectly -a health indicator in itself and this is in accordance with the above definition. Collectively, the different criteria selected in the index have a descriptive value for the whole farm health situation but they do not have an individual direct causative value with respect to a specific disease (Evans, 1978) or to disease transmission per se by the concerned pigs since for example none of the criteria gives a measure of viral shedding. Thus the health indicators are meant to describe the trend and/or to find out the factors which make that a farm is more or less liable to show such or such diseases. The relative economic impact of the different diseases of swine was not directly taken into account when selecting the health indicators. Since the target farms were farms selling young replacement stock, the objective was not to assess the relation between health and financial income. Such attempts have been undertaken elsewhere (Ellis and James, 1979 , Dijkhuisen, 1989 , Madec et al. 1992 . Nevertheless, it can be noticed in the list of the health indicators that respiratory and reproductive problems, which are very detrimental in financial terms, hold a place of choice in the profile.",

This might indicate a low infection pressure. Whereas, when most of the health indicators were at a bad level, the response of the piglets was severe. Nevertheless a new issue might be raised: were the gilts selected truly representative of the real health status of the farms. It has not been possible to solve this problem completely.
