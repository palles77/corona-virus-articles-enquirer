Comparisons and statistical scorings were made using the database (release 6.8 of 28 August 1985, containing 3309 sequences) and programs of the Protein Identification Resource of the National Biomedical Research Foundation. The search program compared every decapeptide in bovine brain myelin proteolipid with every decapeptide in the database. The calculation of similarity scores was accomplished using the Mutation Data Matrix [12] program. For each proteolipid decapeptide, 709253 comparisons were made and the highest scoring segments and their standard deviations were printed out. We selected those viral decapeptides, similar to extramembrane hydrophilic segments of myelin proteolipid, with scores higher than 30, and which also exceed the average by 5 standard deviations; i.e., the probability that the match is due to random chance is <3 x 10 -7 .

In particular, the nonapeptide, Phe-Ser-Trp-Gly-Ala-Glu-Gly-GIn-Lys, has been shown to be highly effective in inducing EAE in guinea pigs, and studies with peptide analogs indicate that the essential features of an encephalitogenic determinant are X-X-Trp-X-X-X-X-Gln/Asn-Lys/Arg. The proteolipid contains two regions that have a Trp and a Lys residue separated by 5 residues, but otherwise they are not remarkably similar to the encephalitogenic MBP peptide. It is interesting, however, that one of the tryptophans (Trp-144) occurs in a region that shows several similarities with viral proteins (table 1). In the course of our analysis, we also found a strong similarity, not previously reported [3] , between the encephalitogenic MBP protein and the gag-pol polyprotein of murine leukemia virus It would not be surprising if antibodies against the MLV peptide were found to cross-react with MBP.",

In addition Pruijn et al. [15] have reported that sera from patients suffering from autoimmune diseases can inhibit adenovirus DNA replication, suggesting a similar phenomenon. The similarities between viral proteins and myelin proteolipid may represent yet another case. In this instance, it seems likely that portions of the protein which are potential antigenic determinants are located on the outer surface of the cell membrane, making it more understandable how the cell membrane could come under immunological attack.",
