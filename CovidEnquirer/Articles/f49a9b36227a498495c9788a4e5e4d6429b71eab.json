Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I 2 -statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result.",

Also pulmonary nodules, cavitation, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy were absent in the cases (5). Another study among 6 patients with confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV in China revealed multifocal or unifocal involvement of ground-glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation and fibrosis as basic pattern.

In a study among 21 nonrespiratory compromised patients with 2019-nCoV, multiple CT images were performed in the process of recovery. The authors classified 4 radiologic stages. In stage 1 (0-4 days after onset of disease), GGO in the lower lobes was the main finding. In stage 2 (5-8 days after the onset) the infection extended and diffuse GGO, crazy-paving pattern and consolidation were observed. In stage 3 (9-13 days after the onset, peak stage), the consolidation was the dominant abnormality and finally in sage 4 (\u226514 days after the onset, absorption stage), consolidation was absorbed. There was no crazy-paving pattern but still a remarkable GGO abnormality in this stage. Furthermore, in this study, GGO and peripheral distribution were dominant (more than 50% of patients) in all 4 stages. Also, bilateral multilobe involvement was dominant in stages 2, 3 and 4.

The comparison of radiologic features of pulmonary involvement of these viral pathogens with other viruses, may help radiologists make more accurate diagnoses based on CT images. Generally, the chest CT scan findings of the 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and MERS are similar (25, 26), however 2019-nCoV may present with specific characteristics. CT scan in patients with influenza lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) shows diffused GGO and localized bronchial wall thickening in upper and mid lobes in comparison with 2019-nCoV that mostly affects lower lobes (21, 27, 28). GGO and bronchial wall thickening in mid and upper lobes and centrilobular opacities are radiologic manifestations of RSV LRTI and bronchiolitis but the consolidation and GGO can be present in severe cases(29-31). SARS-CoV infection is another LRTI that appears with progressive pneumonia shows GGO in early phase of the disease and gradually turns into reticular opacities within 4 weeks. The pattern remains in CT scan for months especially in patients with prolonged dyspnea. The CT scan patterns of viral LRTI are not characteristic but the epidemic parameters in addition to signs and symptoms can lead us to the diagnosis (32-34). In summary, bilateral peripheral pattern of GGO, interlobular septal thickening and consolidation mostly in bilateral lower lobes of lung in chest CT scans of suspected individuals in combination with epidemiological data, presence of fever and cough and laboratory positive results, are highly in favor of the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV in an individual, but this pattern does not observed in all cases as we showed 14% with laboratory finding may not have either consolidation or GGO which may be missed during screening with CT scan.",
