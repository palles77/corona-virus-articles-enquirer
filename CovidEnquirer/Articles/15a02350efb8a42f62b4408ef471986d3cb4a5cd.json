For instance, simple epidemic models relying on a small number of parameters can play an important role in characterizing epidemic growth and generating short-term epidemic forecasts. In the absence of reliable information about transmission mechanisms of emerging infectious diseases, phenomenological models are useful to characterize epidemic growth patterns without the need to explicitly model transmission mechanisms and the natural history of the disease. In this article, our goal is to discuss and illustrate the role of regularization methods for estimating parameters and generating disease forecasts using the generalized Richards model in the context of the 2014e15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa.",

At the early stage of an outbreak, when incidence data are limited and subject to reporting delays, it is often premature to characterize the transition rates of individuals between various disease epidemiological compartments using, for instance, SEIR-type systems of differential equations, which may involve a substantial number of unknown parameters. For the early transmission period, phenomenological models of a logistic type, describing the progression of the epidemic in terms of the cumulative number of reported cases, C, provide a simple alternative.

However, the statistical analysis of the fitting accuracy for the original and generalized Richards models indicates that the generalized Richards model outperforms its original version for epidemics characterized by an early sub-exponential growth phase . For such outbreaks, the value of parameter p in (1.1) is less than 1 (0 < p < 1), and the reduction in the residual sum of squares appears to be statistically significant. Several mechanisms could give rise to initial sub-exponential growth in case incidence including (Chowell, Viboud, Hyman, & Simonsen, 2015; Viboud, Simonsen, & Chowell, 2015) : (i) spatially clustered contact structures (e.g., high clustering levels) (Chowell et al., 2015; Szendroi & Csanyi, 2004) ; (ii) early onset of population behavioral changes and control interventions (Chowell et al., 2015; Szendroi & Csanyi, 2004) ; and (iii) substantial heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectivity of the host population that introduces high local variability in the local reproduction number that fluctuates around the epidemic threshold at 1.0. The two limiting cases of the generalized Richards model are those in which p \u00bc 0 (constant incidence growth) or p \u00bc 1 (exponential growth) (Viboud et al., 2015) . Fig. 2 illustrates representative epidemic profiles, dC dt , that the generalized Richards model supports, as the deceleration of growth parameter, p, is varied. Overall, as parameter p increases, the epidemic profile shows faster growth that converges to exponential rate as p/1 while keeping the epidemic size, K, fixed. On the other hand, parameter a modulates the epidemic turning point (Fig. 2) , which occurs earlier as this parameter increases.",

To overcome the danger of noise propagation, which is evident from the severely ill-conditioned Jacobian, our next step is (a) to regularize (stabilize) the functional f \u00f0q\u00de in (2.5) by incorporating a priori information about the unknown parameters; (b) to develop an efficient problem oriented numerical solver that would further increase our chances of computing a reasonably accurate solution. Without regularization, the algorithm may diverge due to error accumulation at every step, or the uncertainty could get out of control. The most common a priori information is the one that uses our best guess on the potential values of q. Less common, but very helpful for this particular application, is the information on the expected orders of magnitude for b, p, a, and t. Specifically, since t has the meaning of the disease turning point, its value should be about one or two orders of magnitude larger than b, p, and a. This suggests that, as we introduce a priori information, parameters b, p, and a must be appropriately weighted to balance the sensitivity of our model to all four unknowns.

For illustration, we use early incident reported data to estimate the values of five unknown parameters, r, t, p, a, and K, by solving the regularized least squares problem with the RIRGN method (3.4). Then we substitute the estimated parameters into (1.1) to find the approximate values of future incident cases using the built-in Matlab ode23s solver.

The values of p in q 0 andq are taken to be 0.7 and 0.1, respectively, to enforce the sub-exponential growth rate. The values of two remaining parameters, b (used to compute r) and a are taken to be 1 in both vectors for the lack of better information. Fig. 3 illustrates parameter estimation and the epidemic forecasts based on the generalized Richards model with 20 weeks of incident case data for the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone. After the five unknown parameters have been recovered from early epidemic data, 100 additional data bootstrap curves are generated by adding a Poisson error structure to the weekly series of reported cases (see (Chowell, Ammon, Hengartner, & Hyman, 2006) ) in order to quantify uncertainty in the recovered parameters. An alternative is to employ analytic results from asymptotic theory to estimate parameter uncertainty (Banks, Davidian, Samuels, & Sutton, 2009) . The histograms in the upper row show the recovered values of the parameters, while the collection of curves at the bottom of the figure demonstrates the accuracy of the forecasting.",

Since this outbreak is also the longest, we need more data (30 weeks) to forecast future incidence cases. On the other hand, the Liberia outbreak, which is 45 weeks total, can be projected from as little as 12 weeks of early data. This inverse modeling approach could be adapted to analyze outbreaks of other disease system, e.g., avian influenza, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Zika. One could envision disease forecasts for an emerging outbreak in real time with updates every few weeks or so (depending on the disease system).",
