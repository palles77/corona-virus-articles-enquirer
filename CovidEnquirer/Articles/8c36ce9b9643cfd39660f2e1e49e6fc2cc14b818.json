It is also roughly the number of AIDS and malaria deaths combined in 1 year. Yet deaths in newborn babies are rarely mentioned in global-health priorities. A misconception has been that highly technical care is needed. On the contrary, our estimates suggest that up to three-quarters of these deaths could be prevented with low-technology interventions at an additional cost of less than US$1 per head for the 75 countries with the highest mortality. 2, 4 What is needed is the political will to ensure that these interventions reach the women and babies who need them. 3, 4 1 year on, we ask: what progress has been made over the past year in policy, in funding, and most importantly, in programmes in high-mortality countries?",

UNICEF has led the development of draft guidelines for newborn health programming (panel 1).

There is wider recognition that midwifery training should include training in simple care and resuscitation of newborn babies, although challenges remain in health-system roll-out, including a shortage of competency-based training, a lack of supervision, few resuscitation dummies for training, and insuffi cient supplies of bags and masks. A companion volume on neonatal deaths and stillbirths is being added to WHO's maternal audit guide, Beyond the numbers. Work continues to improve the ability of verbal autopsy instruments in capturing deaths in newborn babies and identifying the causes of death.

The Road Map uses a systematic, stepwise approach to develop, accept, fund, and implement a national plan. Since its launch in 2004, at least 32 African countries have begun the process, and plans have been adopted in 12 countries, overseen by a regional task force. In some countries, health components for newborn babies could need review and strengthening, but the recognition and inclusion of care for newborn babies is an essential fi rst step q A large group of partners are working together to develop programme and policy guides, adapting approaches, and building capacity in organisations and countries. A publication, Opportunities for Africa's Newborns, is in preparation. This monograph will detail eight opportunities to integrate newborn care in existing programmes and provide profi les of 46 countries, plus a CD-ROM of relevant information The focus of The Lancet series on newborn survival was deliberate. However, as mortality reduces, non-fatal outcomes, especially in children surviving with disabilities, become increasingly important. Stillbirths, issues of maternal and fetal malnutrition aff ecting intrauterine growth, and long-term disability outcomes are still largely ignored in low-resource settings, and we still know little about how to address these problems. New systematic estimates for stillbirth rates in 190 countries will increase visibly for these neglected deaths, which are closely linked to newborn survival. 20 Nevertheless, we hesitate to expand the newborn research agenda too soon, in view of the very small number of relevant eff ectiveness trials. 21 A major need is to increase and strengthen the capacity for newborn research in Africa, and it is to be hoped that Asian researchers will contribute to this.",

First, we repeat the call for country plans by the end of 2007. These do not need to be stand-alone plans for newborn health, but an overall strategy for how governments plan to reduce deaths in newborn babies, in safe motherhood, child health, and other related programmes. Because a high percentage of deaths at ages less than 5 years old are neonatal, no government that is serious about Millennium Development Goal 4 can aff ord to omit newborn health interventions. The RoadMap process in Africa provides an opportunity for all African countries to develop such plans in a public forum with accountability for results (panel 2).",

Indeed, in the countries that have undertaken strategic planning, examination of newborn health can clearly serve as a catalyst to bring maternal and child health groups together and to link maternal, neonatal, and child care, with benefi ts for mothers, babies, and children.

Programme implementation does not just need increased funding, although current levels are clearly not commensurate with the number of deaths and the cost-eff ectiveness of the solutions. 2 Funding should be spent strategically, including investment in human resources. Increased personnel are needed to provide technical support; to work in ministries of health to link essential programmes for maternal, neonatal, and child health with each other; and to deliver services to mothers and babies, especially those in under-served populations. The World Health Report 2005 21 estimated that an additional 700 000 skilled birth attendants are needed to provide universal coverage of maternal and newborn services in 75 countries, where maternal and neonatal mortality is high. 22 However, a great deal can be achieved for maternal, neonatal, and child care through community-based interventions that can be delivered by community health workers. The current wave of new community health workers will be most eff ective in saving lives if highly eff ective interventions for maternal, neonatal, and child care are the core set of tasks, and if the lessons of the fi rst revolution in primary health care are applied-ie, the need for supervision, close links with the rest of the health system, and remuneration.",

This goal will need ongoing investment from countries and donors and should be seen for what it is: an investment in the health of the next generation. However, money is not all that is needed.

On National Newborn Health Day, the Indian Government issued a special stamp highlighting the health of newborn babies (fi gure) and the Indian Prime Minister has made a commitment to address this \"national shame\" Policy q UNICEF's new health and nutrition strategy focuses on Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 and on increasing coverage of essential interventions, recognising the importance of survival of newborn babies for child survival goals. UNICEF previously had no programme guidance on the health of newborn babies, but has developed a policy entitled \"Strategic Guidance for Programming for Newborn Health\" q WHO ran a workshop to increase capacity of regional and subregional child health advisers to support countries in incorporating newborn health into child health strategies (New Delhi, December, 2005) q Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) materials, emergency obstetric care, and many other clinical and programmatic guidelines are being reviewed by various UN organisations and partners to incorporate or strengthen newborn health components Partnering q The Partnership for Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health 10 was launched after the merger of three partnerships that worked together on the Comments for The Lancet series 5 q The International Paediatric Association is launching a global movement of paediatricians for newborn health.

Interventions for newborn babies are now more commonly regarded as part of the funding for general health systems. For example, the World Bank is providing $250 million to the Democratic Republic of the Congo for health system rehabilitation, and interventions for newborn babies are part of the national package. The Department for International Development (DfID) and the US Agency for International Department (USAID) have funded maternal and newborn health programmes in Pakistan with about $250 million over 5 years. Spurred by a health policy review13 and the launch of The Lancet Neonatal Survival Series in Islamabad, the Government of Pakistan is launching a new 5-year programme on maternal, neonatal, and child health under a new cell in the Ministry of Health. In Bangladesh, a comprehensive national policy now supports newborn health, newborn health-indicators are included in the national healthinformation system, and 11% of the national budget for health training is allocated to care of newborn babies. India has increased spending on public health in 2006 from 0\u00b79% of the gross domestic product to 2-3% in 4 years, with most ploughed into the National Rural Health Mission to reduce the infant mortality rate and maternal mortality ratio. In several African countries, health of newborn babies has been included in national sector-wide planning and allocated resources by linking to initiatives to accelerate maternal mortality reduction (panel 2).Neonatal tetanus still accounts for more than 200 000 deaths a year, despite a second global-elimination goal for 2005.",
