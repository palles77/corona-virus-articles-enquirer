            "text": "We have concentrated on the adenovirus as the source of the heightened inflammatory response of the lungs of patients with COPD. We have concentrated in particular on the responses to agents such as lipopolysaccharides and environmental particulates that contaminate the air we breathe, and we have accumulated evidence that the E1A gene of this virus could be the key player in this process. As other intracellular pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD, our studies on the adenovirus E1A could serve as the model for investigating the interaction between host and extrinsic factors in the chronic progression of this debilitating lung disease. E pidemiologic studies suggest that childhood infections are an independent risk factor for the development of COPD in adulthood. [1] [2] [3] We are interested in adenovirus infections because they are a common cause of bronchiolitis in children and young adults 4 -9 that could predispose them to the development of COPD. In particular, group C adenovirus is endemic, and exposure to it during childhood could lead to latent infections that persist in the lung, 10 tonsils, 11-13 and peripheral blood lymphocytes. 14 COPD is characterized by cough and sputum production, peripheral airways obstruction, and emphysematous destruction of the lung surface area. All three of these components have been related to an inflammatory process located in the conducting airways and lung parenchyma. [15] [16] [17] [18] Although cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for the development of COPD, only 15 to 20% of all smokers develop airways obstruction. 19 -21 Therefore, we postulate that adenovirus that remains from a previous infection of the lungs in a minority of smokers enhances the inflammatory process in their lungs.",

The genome of adenovirus is a double-stranded linear DNA of approximately 36,000 base pairs. 22 It consists of inverted terminal repeats that are required for the replication of the viral DNA, and between these termini are the transcription units that specify the viral proteins required to allow the viral genes to be expressed and viral replication to proceed. There are five early transcription units (Fig 1) . These are the first viral genes expressed during an active infection, and they initiate three processes. One process is to induce the host cell to enter the S phase of the cell cycle and thereby to provide a replicating environment. The second process is to provide protection from the host immune system, and the third process is to produce the viral proteins needed for viral DNA replication. All three goals require transcriptional activation of viral genes, and the principal activating proteins are those encoded by the E1A gene (Fig 1) , which itself is controlled by its own constitutively active promoter.",

            "text": "We targeted the E1A gene as the viral gene responsible for enhancing host inflammatory mediator expression because its gene products are well-characterized transactivators that function by interacting with numerous cellular transcription factors, 23 transcriptional coactivators, 24, 25 and cell cycle regulatory proteins. 26 These studies on E1A have focused on this viral protein as a model with which to study the regulation of transcription in mammalian cells, but this regulation has not been the target of studies on pathologic processes. The modulation of the activity of nuclear factor-B (NF-B), which is a key transcription factor regulating the expression of inflammatory mediator genes, 27 by E1A 28 -30 as well as the indirect effects of E1A on NF-B that are mediated by coactivators cyclic adenosine-3\u0408,5\u0408-monophosphate responsive element binding protein and a related p300 protein, 30, 31 have been demonstrated. These results are in keeping with the concept that cyclic adenosine-3\u0408,5\u0408-monophosphate responsive element binding protein/p300 can interact with a wide variety of factors that regulate transcription, including DNA binding proteins, the proteins of the basal transcriptional machinery, as well as viral proteins such as E1A, and some of these can bind to each other. 32 The vast array of signals that bombard a cell could be integrated in this fashion and could result in the formation of specific multiprotein complexes bound to DNA, which ultimately controls the activity of a gene. Within this schema, E1A could exert its influence, whether it be activating or repressing, through its direct interaction with different components of this multiprotein complex. The regulation of the genes of inflammatory mediators either directly or indirectly by such a mechanism is of particular interest to us because this could drive the inflammatory process that is present in the airways of all smokers to produce airways obstruction in the 15 to 20% of those with latent adenoviral infections.",

We demonstrated that lung tissue from patients with COPD carries more group C adenoviral DNA, specifically its E1A gene, than that of nonobstructed control subjects who were matched for age, gender, and smoking history. 10 Although this could have been explained by a greater susceptibility to infection by adenovirus in smokers or patients with respiratory disorders, it seemed unlikely for two reasons. First, a comparison of group C adenoviral E1A DNA in the lungs of patients with bronchiectasis 33 and a variety of other chronic lung disorders 34, 35 showed that smokers with COPD carry the heaviest load of adenoviral E1A DNA. Second, in the acute exacerbations that characterize COPD, rhinovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and coronavirus were implicated in these acute respiratory illnesses, but not adenovirus. 36 This strongly suggests that the presence of adenovirus in the lungs of COPD patients is not due to an increased susceptibility to these infections because of smoking or exacerbations.",

More recent studies have shown that levels of all inflammatory cell types found in the lung except B cells were increased in lungs of patients with severe emphysema and that this increased inflammation was associated with a fivefold increase in the number of alveolar epithelial cells expressing E1A protein. 39 Furthermore, the E1A gene was found to be integrated at a specific site on chromosome 19 in the lung cells of patients with COPD. 40 ",

Our findings of not only increased expression of IL-8 but also of ICAM-1, a cell-surface glycoprotein that serves as a ligand for adhesion receptors including the leukocyte \u2424 2 integrins, suggest that the migration and activation of inflammatory cells in response to cigarette smoke or other noxious stimuli might be 184S regulated by cytokines that are secreted by lung epithelial cells and that a dysregulation of this process by adenovirus E1A could lead to the emphysematous destruction that is associated with COPD.",

One of these, NF-B, is usually found in the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitor of B (IB), which masks the nuclear localization signal of NF-B. On appropriate stimulation, signals transduced through the cell culminate in the phosphorylation of IB, which marks the degradation of this inhibitor. 27 The released NF-B translocates to the nucleus where it binds to its recognition sequence in the promoters of genes activated by that stimulus. While LPS is a well-known stimulus of NF-B, CD14, its receptor, is not intrinsically connected to the transmembrane signal transduction apparatus. It has been shown that LPS also binds to the transmembrane toll-like receptors (TLR) that initiate signal cascades that are shared with the IL-1 receptor, resulting in the phosphorylation of IB. 51 Of the nine TLR genes identified to date in mammals, controversy exists between TLR2 and TLR4 as specific receptors of bacterial endotoxins, although evidence favors the latter for endotoxins from Gram-negative bacteria 51 such as the LPS used in our own experiments. In this regard, it is interesting to note that in cases of acute respiratory exacerbations, particularly in patients with severe COPD, Gram-negative bacteria have been isolated. 52, 53 Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of transcription factors demonstrated that LPS treatment activated NF-B binding complexes that consisted of RelA and p50; however, this occurred only in the nuclei of E1A-positive cells. 54 This finding was confirmed when nuclear translocation of NF-B, as detected by immunofluorescence staining, was observed after LPS stimulation, again occurring only in E1A-positive cells. 54 The same treatment did not increase the binding activity of activator protein-1, another transcription factor the activity of which is documented to be affected by E1A, 28, 55, 56 in either E1Apositive or E1A-negative cells.",

An acknowledged limitation of this model system is that these are mutated cancer cells and are most likely type II alveolar epithelial cells in origin. 59 As such, they are more relevant to the pathogenesis of the emphysematous changes than to the airways obstruction component of COPD.
