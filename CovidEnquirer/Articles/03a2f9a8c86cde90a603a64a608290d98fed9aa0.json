Objective: To investigate the role of viral infections, allergen sensitization, and exposure to indoor allergens as risk factors for acute wheezing in children 0 to 12 years old. Methods: One hundred thirty-two children 0 to 12 years of age who sought emergency department care for wheezing and 65 children with no history of wheezing were enrolled in this case-control study. Detection of respiratory syncytial virus antigen, rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza antigens was performed in nasal washes. Total IgE and specific IgE to mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were measured with the CAP system. Major allergens from mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were quantified in dust samples by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression. Results: In children under 2 years of age, infection with respiratory viruses and family history of allergy were independently associated with wheezing (odds ratio, 15.5 and 4.2; P = .0001 and P = .008, respectively). Among children 2 to 12 years old, sensitization to inhalant allergens was the major risk factor for wheezing (odds ratio, 2.7; P = .03). High-level allergen exposure, exposure to tobacco smoke, and lack of breast-feeding showed no association with wheezing.",

            "text": "Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Evidence indicates that more than half of the cases of persistent asthma start before the age of 3 years, and it is now clear that airway inflammation and irreversible remodeling may be initiated early in life. 1, 2 Definitive diagnosis of asthma and subsequent decision to initiate long-term anti-inflammatory treatment at an early age has been a challenge in pediatric practice. 3 Although asthma in young children appears to represent a heterogeneous disease with distinct phenotypes, sensitization to common inhalant allergens including those derived from dust mites, cockroach, cat, and Alternaria remains a major risk factor for persistent asthma associated with airway hyperreactivity and decreased lung function. [4] [5] [6] Respiratory viruses have been recognized as major triggers of wheezing episodes and asthma exacerbation. 7 In the northern hemisphere, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for the majority of wheezing episodes in children younger than 2 years of age, being detected in 60% to 80% of infants. 7 Results of the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study 8 revealed that lower respiratory tract infection with RSV early in life was associated with persistent wheezing; however, by age 13 years, lung function abnormalities were no longer present and wheezing resolved in most children. In one study, severe RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life has been linked to asthma and allergic sensitization at age 7 years 9 ; however, studies to determine whether RSV infections enhance allergy have provided conflicting results. 7 It has been definitely established that specific IgE response to RSV is not an important element in the pathogenesis of RSVinduced wheezing 10 ; however, the virus has been shown to induce expression of cytokines and chemokines and activation of monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes, which may influence the mechanisms involved in the development of asthma in children. 7 In older children, rhinovirus becomes the dominant viral pathogen linked to wheezing exacerbations. This has been demonstrated in community-based and emergency department studies. 11, 12 In the emergency department setting, rhinovirus infections act synergistically with allergen sensitization and/or allergen exposure to induce severe asthma symptoms in both children and adults. 12, 13 In keeping with this, lower respiratory tract symptoms and markers of inflammation in young adults with mild asthma experimentally infected with rhinovirus are more pronounced in those with high total IgE. 14 It is thought that a deficient T H 1-type response with decreased IFN-\u03b3 production underlies the observation that rhinovirus infections in atopic individuals are more severe and longer-lasting and induce more lower respiratory symptoms as compared with nonatopic subjects. 15 The purpose of the current study was to investigate the role of viral infections, allergen sensitization, and exposure to indoor allergens as risk factors for acute wheezing in children 0 to 12 years old living in a subtropical environment. The results of the current study may contribute to promote better care of children with wheezing in these areas.",

Patients were selected for the study if they presented with wheezing that required therapy with inhaled \u03b22-agonists as judged by the attending physician. In addition, 65 children 0 to 12 years of age (39 boys) without respiratory symptoms and no previous history of wheezing who sought ED care at the same hospitals for other reasons were selected as control subjects. The most frequent complaints among the control subjects were acute gastroenteritis, fever, abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, and seizures. Children with chronic respiratory illnesses (n = 2) (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and those who reported therapy with corticosteroids within 4 weeks before the ED visit (n = 8) were not included in the study. All children were residents in the city of Ribeir\u00e3o Preto. Wheezing and control children were enrolled every month from October 1998 to June 2000, except for December 1998. Approximately 3% of all children seen in the ED over the study period were enrolled in the study, and 95% of the children approached were enrolled.

Typing of adenovirus isolated from cultures to the subgenus level was performed by amplification of the VA-RNA region of the viral genome by PCR, according to previously described method. 19 PCR products of 520 to 522 bp and 505 bp in length corresponded to adenovirus subgenera B and C, respectively. Certain adenovirus serotypes including those of subgenus C can be identified in nasal aspirates up to several weeks after acute infection. 20 To minimize the interference of latent adenovirus, only subgenus B was included in the analysis.",

We have found that RSV infection was strongly associated with wheezing among children under 2 years of age. 7, 12 The frequency of RSV was lower than that reported in temperate regions (39% versus 60% to 80%). 7 However, if we consider the subgroup of infants 0 to 6 months old, 61% tested positive for RSV antigen. RSV infections were predominantly found in the months of February to May, corresponding to late summer and early to mid-fall, indicating that the virus occurs in a different seasonal pat-tern as compared with that of the northern hemisphere. The available data indicate that the main age group affected by RSV in developing countries is children under 6 months of age and that in tropical or subtropical climates RSV outbreaks are frequently associated with the rainy season. 23 Household and day care-based prospective studies in coastal northeast Brazil have identified RSV at an unexpectedly low frequency, 0% to 4%. 24, 25 A previous study in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, analyzing samples of 829 children under 5 years of age with nonspecific respiratory tract symptoms seen in the ED revealed that RSV was present in 21.6% of nasal washes. However, the vast majority of RSV infections (157/188 episodes, 83.5%) were found in children under 1 year of age. 26 Health care delivery and quality \u00a7High-level exposure to mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were defined as group 1 mite allergen levels \u226510 \u00b5g/g of dust; cockroach allergens Bla g 1 \u22658 U/g or Bla g 2 \u22650.32 \u00b5g/g of dust; cat allergen Fel d 1 \u22658 \u00b5g/g of dust; and dog allergen Can f 1 \u226510 \u00b5g/g of dust, respectively, at least in one site of the home. n.d., Not done. IgE to food allergens was not assayed on children ages 2 to 12 years; -, odds ratios for variables with a zero value could not be calculated with STATA 6.0. The lack of evidence for association of rhinovirus and wheezing in the current study is striking. It is possible that genetic factors may play a role in determining immunologic responses to rhinovirus in different populations. In addition, rhinovirus serotypes circulating in tropical areas may be different from those in temperate climates, particularly regarding their ability to replicate in the lower respiratory airways. Temperatures in the lower airways may be critical for the intensity of replication, at least for some rhinovirus serotypes. 27 It has been demonstrated that inhalation of cold air results in substantial temperature decrease in the lower airways 28 that may favor rhinovirus replication. In the northern hemisphere, rhinovirus peak prevalence occurs in early fall and late spring and has been associated with new school terms. 29 In subtropical climates, it is possible that higher temperatures year-round may be less conducive to productive growth of rhinovirus. Reduced rhinovirus spread in these areas could, at least in part, be due to the styles of housing peculiar to warmer climates, with homes and schools being ventilated by keeping windows open.",

We have previously reported that mites and cockroach were major causes of sensitization among children with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis, seen at university-based allergy clinics in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. 36 In the current study, the frequency of allergic sensitization was very high, notably among control children (43% of the children). Part of the reason for finding a higher-than-expect-ed frequency of sensitization among control subjects may be due to the fact that we have not aimed to exclude subjects with allergic rhinitis from the control group. It would be difficult to have a definitive diagnosis of allergic rhinitis among children with respiratory distress at the ED setting. It is possible that some subjects with allergic rhinitis may have been included as control subjects, particularly in the group of children older than 2 years of age.",

In the current study, we have found that IgE antibodies to A lumbricoides were more frequently found in wheezing children than in control children; however, this association was no longer significant after multivariate analysis.",

Inhalant allergens appear to be a major cause of asthma attacks in this environment, and rhinovirus does not appear to play a remarkable role in triggering asthma symptoms, as previously described in temperate regions.",
