A growing number of enteric microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses and protozoa in sewage have been identified as important waterborne pathogens. Most waterborne pathogens are introduced into drinking water supplies and recreational waters by human and animal wastes and poor wastewater infrastructure as well as inadequate treatment. This includes leaking sewers, combined sewer overflows, urban storm water runoff, agricultural land runoff, faulty septic tanks/drain fields and poorly treated wastewater discharges. The vital role of public health in minimizing community wide-spread acquisition of these waterborne pathogens and infectious disease control of the hundreds of pathogens has drawn attention to the need for detecting and identifying bacteria, parasites and viruses directly in water.",

Culture-based methods have long been extensively used to detect microbial pathogens in environmental matrices and are considered to be 'gold standard', but inherent problems exist, such as lengthy time of analysis, labor intensive and the inability to detect uncultivated species. The term ''the great plate count anomaly'' was coined by Staley and Konopka [1] over 20 years ago to describe great discrepancy between direct microscopic counting and numbers of bacteria that can be enumerated from environmental samples by plating procedures. The ability to access DNA sequences of microbial genomes offers an exciting alternative for exploring and improving the characterization and rapid detection of a diverse group of pathogens in water.",

By increasing the capacity to detect a wide range of microbial pathogens in waters, novel and potential pathogens could be recognized and associated with waterborne diseases and better characterization of known pathogens can be undertaken for waterborne diseases of unknown etiology. According to Web of Science, 403 articles with qPCR and water as key words have been published since 1998 with over 100 articles in 2010 and 2011. Citations of this work grew to over 900/year by 2011. This article reviews some of the most recent and significant progress in molecular tools for the detection of pathogens in water. eliminated many iconic waterborne enteric diseases such as typhoid and cholera in the North America and Europe. However, microbial pathogens continue to be a major cause of water-related disease outbreaks globally and remain a key public health challenge in providing safe drinking water and recreational water in the 21st century. In addition to these traditional waterborne pathogens, a significant number of emerging and re-emerging pathogens have now been recognized and water transmission has caused significant outbreaks; examples include Escherichia coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Legionella pneumophila, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacterium avium complex, enteric viruses such as noroviruses and hepatitis E virus, and the parasites Cryptosporidium parvum and Microsporidia. According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO)'s Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, zoonotic pathogens which make up 75% of the emerging pathogens, pose the greatest challenges to ensuring the safety of drinking water and ambient water [2]. The list of potential waterborne pathogens is extensive [2] and Table 1 provides examples of emerging waterborne pathogens which are also listed on the latest US EPA's Contaminant Candidate List (CCL-3). Because of the nature of waterborne pathogens, what is perceived as small concentrations are associated with high levels of community risks [3] . The use of quantitative microbial risk assessment allows for an improved understanding of how concentrations, loading and transport influence probability of infection associated with microbial contamination of water.",

Phylogenetic microarrays such as the PhyloChip have been proven to be useful in determining microbial community structure [6] . The Phy-loChip that targets the known diversity within the 16S rRNA gene is able to simultaneously identify any of thousands of taxa present in an environmental sample. The current version (G3) of the PhyloChip allows simultaneous detection of up to 50,000 bacterial, archaeal and microalgal taxa [7] . Besides monitoring bacterial population during environmental bioremediation, PhyloChip technology has been used for monitoring airborne bacteria for bioterrorism surveillance [8] , microbial community analysis in biological wastewater treatment systems [9] and microbial source tracking of pathogens in coastal urban watershed [10] . More recently, two methods of PCR-independent microbial community analysis using the microarray PhyloChip: direct rRNA hybridization and doublestrand cDNA generation and hybridization have been developed, providing cost-effective and PCR bias-free alternatives to PCR-amplified microbial community analysis [11] . The ViroChip, a pan-virus DNA microarray containing thousands of unique 70-mer oligonucleotide probes to target all viral families known to infect humans has been described by Wang et al. [12, 13] . The authors demonstrated that this approach coupled with a random PCR amplification strategy, was able to detect multiple viruses as well as novel members of known viral families.",

The concept of PCR remains unchanged since its inception. However, the agarose gel-based detection of PCR amplification products has undergone dramatically changes that have led to a revolutionary testing platform, namely quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), which enables quantification of DNA targets by monitoring amplified products during cycling as indicated by increased fluorescence [16 ] . In the past few years, the development of qPCR has provided significant improvements in PCR-based assays for the detection of waterborne bacterial, viral and protozoan pathogens (Table 1) . Currently, qPCR offers numerous advantages over conventional, end-point PCR techniques such as higher sensitivity and specificity, faster rate of detection, no post-PCR analysis and thereby minimizing the risk of carryover contamination, and the capability to provide quantitative results. The dual-labeled fluorescent probe such as TaqMan probe has been the most popular technique of choice for detecting pathogens in environmental samples owing to its higher specificity. The advantage of this assay is that the target amplicon is verified by the probe which recognizes internal amplicon sequences. Inclusion of an internal control in each sample is essential for the accuracy of quantitative results, particularly for complex environmental matrices, by monitoring the efficiency of nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription (for RNA target) as well as the presence of PCR inhibitors.",

Moreover, the use of qRT-PCR for the analysis of non-cultivable noroviruses [17] and slow growing hepatitis A virus [18] has been fundamental to advancing the understanding of the occurrence of these human pathogens in water environments. Surveys around the world have begun exploring the occurrence of both DNA and RNA viruses in water by qPCR (see [19 ] for a review). However, there were no consistent trends found in regard to the viral types or levels. The molecular characterization of environmental viral strains has revealed a great genetic diversity of human pathogenic viruses in polluted surface waters [20] . Yet no global survey of viruses has been undertaken by evaluating the same virus targets, using the same protocols. A temporal assessment is needed to compare the diversity and level of viral infections and water pollution to contrast developing to developed regions of the world, from tropical environments to temperate conditions and to contrast rural versus urban populations. It may be possible to take on global virus characterization in the future with evolution in technology that allows higher throughput and hundreds of targets.",

The latest 454 sequencing platform, GX FLX+ is able to produce one million reads (with a read length of up to 1000 bases) per 23-hour sequencing run.",

Moreover, sequencing of outbreak isolates is of public health interest, particularly if rapid data about virulence markers can be obtained. Most recently, a new whole genome amplification and sequencing approach called 'Single Virus Genomics', which enables the isolation and complete genome sequencing by 454 pyrosequencing of the single virus particle (bacteriophages lambda and T4), has been described [31 ] . This proof-of-concept study is likely to enhance uncultivated virus discovery as well as provide relevant viral reference genomes for the assembly of metagenomic data and the design of qPCR primers and probes targeting uncultivated viruses.

Rapid detection and identification of waterborne pathogens by novel molecular tools are often hampered by the relatively low abundance of target organisms in water samples. Much work has been carried out in the development of rapid, sensitive and specific analytical methods. However, less emphasis has been placed on the pre-analytical or upstream sample processing which must be able to selectively separate and concentrate all target pathogens in each water sample. The preconcentration step is important in improving the detection sensitivity of microbial contaminants, particularly by molecular detection tools which use extremely small sample volumes (a few microliters). Recently, tangential-flow, hollow fiber ultrafiltration, which uses size-exclusion as the mechanism of concentration, has been shown to be a promising technique to concentrate diverse pathogens in a single process [32, 33] . Moreover, ultrafiltration is currently the method of choice to concentrate viruses from large volumes of water for metagenomic detection by pyrosequencing [26 ,27 ] .",
