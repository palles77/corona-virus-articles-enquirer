            "text": "Aims: The present study employed both static and dynamic imaging modalities to study both intra-and extravascular events attributing to steroidassociated osteonecrosis (ON) using an experimental protocol with a single low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and subsequently three injections of high-dose methylprednisolone (MPS). Methods: Fourteen 28-week-old male New Zealand white rabbits received one intravenous injection of LPS (10 \u03bcg/kg). 24 h later, three injections of 20 mg/kg of MPS were given intramuscularly at a time interval of 24 h. Additional 6 rabbits were used as controls. Dynamic MRI was performed on bilateral femora for local intraosseous perfusion before and after LPS injection. Blood samples were collected for hematological examinations before and after LPS injection. Bilateral femora were dissected and decalcified for microCT-based microangiography. ON lesion, intravascular thrombus and extravascular marrow fat cell size were examined histopathologically. Results: Intravascular thrombus was observed in all ON rabbits. Extravascular marrow fat cell size was significantly increased in ON rabbits than that of the controls (P b 0.05). Compared to baseline, a significant decrease in ratio of tissue-type plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, activated partial thromboplatin time and a significant increase in ratio of low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein were only found in ON rabbits (P b 0.05). Dynamic MRI showed a significant decrease in the perfusion index 'maximum enhancement' in the ON rabbits (P b 0.05), and microCT-based microangiography showed blocked stem vessels in ON samples. Overall, 93% of the rabbits (13/14) developed ON, and no rabbits died throughout the experiment period. Conclusion: Both intra-and extravascular events were found attributing to the steroid-associated ON based on our experimental protocol with a single low-dose LPS injection and subsequent three injections of high-dose MPS. Both high ON incidence and no mortality in rabbits treated with this inductive protocol suggested its effectiveness for future studies on evaluation of therapeutic efficacy of interventions developed for prevention of steroid-associated ON.",

            "text": "ON refers to death of bone due to ischemia. The pathogenesis of steroid-associated ON might relate to intravascular thrombus occlusion and extravascular marrow lipid deposition, leading to an impaired structure-function of intraosseous blood supply system. In turn, the impaired intraosseous blood supply system might serve the pathophysiologic pathway and induced local Bone 39 (2006) 863 -871 www.elsevier.com/locate/bone ischemia, necrotic lesion and eventually subchondral bone collapse [5, 6] . As surgical prognosis is always problematic for prevention of subchondral bone collapse [7] , it is highly desirable to develop intervention strategies for steroid-associated ON. It is therefore highly desirable to establish an appropriate animal model and valid evaluation methods not only related to the 'endpoint', i.e. the pathological ON and more importantly the methods for dynamic monitoring of the ON development in studying potential underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. There were two classical inductive protocols commonly used for establishing ON rabbits relevant to steroid. One was to use a single injection of high-dose methylprednisolone (MPS) (H-MPS \u00d7 1), which showed however rather low incidence of ON (43%) [8] . The other was to use two injections of high-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) combined with subsequent three injections of high-dose MPS (H-LPS \u00d7 2 + H-MPS \u00d7 3), which induced higher ON incidence (85%) but accompanied with high mortality of experimental animals (50%) [9] . In testing intervention strategies for steroid-associated ON, there is a need to develop inductive protocols for establishing ON lesions with a high ON incidence yet low or even no mortality.",

This model showed a higher incidence of ON lesion (77%) and lower mortality (11%) in rabbits as compared with the previously published protocol (H-LPS \u00d7 2 + H-MPS \u00d7 3) due to the avoidance of severe LPS-induced shock by lowering the given LPS dose [10] . Furthermore, the steroid-independent inductive protocol (L-LPS \u00d7 1) served as basis for modifying the steroid-associated inductive protocol (H-LPS \u00d7 2 + H-MPS \u00d7 3). Accordingly, we hypothesized that a single injection of low-dose LPS combined with subsequent three injections of high-dose MPS (L-LPS \u00d7 1 + H-MPS \u00d7 3) might induce a high incidence of ON but low or even no mortality in rabbits.",

Under sedation with Katamin (0.25 ml/kg, i.m.), the rabbits were placed in supine with the lower limb flexed and fixed by adhesive tape. An extremity coil (transmitreceive surface coil) was used on the target site. Preliminary sagittal and oblique axial images were obtained to define the femoral longitudinal axis. T1-weighted MRI images (T1W, repetition time [TR] / echo time [TE] = 425/13 ms) were used for analysis of the target side. Imaging parameters were as follows: a section thickness of 3 mm, intersection gap of 1 mm, field of view of 120 mm and imaging matrix of 256 \u00d7 128. A receive-only surface coil was used to cover the target site during MRI acquisition. The contrast-enhanced dynamic MRI pulse sequence used ultrafast T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences (turbo-field echo; Philips) with TR = 2.2 ms, TE = 0.92 ms, pre-pulse inversion time = 400 ms, flip angle = 15\u00b0, scan percentage = 40% and acquisition matrix = 128 \u00d7 128. A total of 200 dynamic images were obtained in 90 s. A bolus of dimeglumin gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) (0.8 mmol/kg/body weight) was rapidly administered manually via a previously placed 21-gauge intravenous catheter in the right ear vein, immediately followed by a 6 ml saline flush at the same injection rate. The dynamic scan started as soon as the injection of the contrast medium commenced. Signal intensity (SI) was then measured in operator-defined ellipse-like regions of interest (ROIs) over the target site beneath the joint space in the mid-coronal T1-weighted images using a cursor and graphic display device (Fig. 1 ). The SI values derived from the ROIs were plotted against time as time-intensity curve (TIC) using the built-in Gyroview software system. The baseline value (SI base ) of the SI in a TIC was calculated as the mean SI value in the first three images. The maximum SI (SI max ) was defined as the peak enhancement value at a given time interval of 90 s after contrast injection during the early phase of the first pass.

The scan was then perpendicular to the shaft and initiated from a reference line 10 mm away from the bottom with an entire scan length of 10 mm (Fig. 2) . The scan was preformed at a resolution of 36 \u03bcm per voxel with 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixel image matrix. For segmentation of blood vessels from background, noise was removed using a low pass Gaussian filter (Sigma = 1.2, Support = 2) and blood vessels were then defined at a threshold of 85. In order to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3-D) architecture of vasculature in either the proximal femur or the distal femur, the blood vessels filled with Microfil were included with semi-automatically drawn contour at each two-dimensional (2-D) section by built-in \"Contouring Program\" for automatic reconstruction of 3-D image of vasculature in the decalcified sample. A histogram was subsequently generated to display the distribution of vessel size, and a color-coded scale was mapped to the surface of the 3-D images to produce a visual representation of the vessel size distribution [16] .",

Phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH) was the staining specifically employed for examination of fibrin thrombus [17] .

The histological sections were digitized into a microscope imaging system (Zeiss Aixoplan with Spot RT digital camera, Zeiss, Germany) for quantification using image analysis software (ImageJ 1.32j, NIH, USA). Briefly, the fat cells were manually traced and labeled calculating the cell size interpreted by Feret's diameter (Fig. 3) , which was the greatest distance between any two points along the boundary of a region of interest [18] . Fat cells that had undergone necrosis were excluded from imaging analysis [10] . (3) Examination of intravascular thrombus: the entire area of each dissected part of bilateral femoral samples was examined for identifying the presence of intravascular thrombus in a blind fashion by two pathologists based on diffuse presence of thrombus stained with PTAH within the marrow vessels.

Twenty four hours after the last MPS injection, the decreasing tendency for APTT maintained, whereas a rapid decreasing tendency in ratio of t-PA/PAI-I presented. This suggested that LPS induced both hypercoagulable and hypofibrinolytic state. In vitro study of others supported the mechanism that LPS was able to induce hypercoagulable and/or hypofibrinolytic state partially through reduction of endothelia expression of thrombomodulin (TM) [19] . In fact, endothelial TM was an important intermediary substance, which directly or indirectly participated in both inhibition of coagulation and promotion of fibrinolysis, while APTT indicated coagulation function and the ratio of t-PA/PAI-I reflected balance between anti-fibrinolysis and pro-fibrinolysis [20] .",

The formation or presence of intravascular thrombosis was well demonstrated by microCT-based microangiography, where the thrombi blocked the perfusion as visualized by disconnected vasculatures of the necrotic lesions in decalcified 3-D microCT intraosseous vascular network. In a pilot study, the investigators also explored if the clinical angiography using radiopaque substance barium sulfate would be a more appreciated approach to monitor the steroid-associated emboli formed in intraosseous vascular network. However, due to its larger particle size with rather lower solubility in solution, only blood vessels larger than 250 \u03bcm were visualized perfused radiographically. Microfil (lead chromate) is a radiopaque solution with a smaller particle size, which was recently used for quantitative microCT analysis of collateral vessel development after ischemic injury [16] and successfully adopted into the present microCT angiographic study. Based on the scan resolution selected, intraosseous vessels in both proximal and distal femur larger than 36 \u03bcm were demonstrated and quantified for comparison. As the microCT available for this study is an in vitro model and the lead chromate is a toxic substance not for in vivo application, we employed dynamic MRI into the current study to monitor the local perfusion disturbance of corresponding skeletal sides.",

A higher LDL/ HDL ratio was regarded reflecting the prominent lipid transport to the peripheral tissues [22] [23] [24] [25] . This might imply that there was a synergetic effect of LPS and MPS on lipid transport to bone marrow. The lipid transport resulting form the higher LDL/HDL ratio might have induced intraosseous hyperlipidemic state, which eventually lead to extravascular marrow compression from lipid deposit. This was evidenced in our histopathological findings, which demonstrated increased fat cell size in the necrotic marrow and accompanied with substantially reduced marrow space for maintaining important functional marrow elements.",

It has been the consensus that any tissue growth or repair relies on functional mature vasculature. The abnormal neo-vasculature found in this study might be used as a measure to investigate potential intervention strategies developed for treatment of steroid-associated ON by evaluating its role in facilitating the restoration of vascular network from the abnormal neo-vasculature in repair of ON lesion. Collectively, both intravascular and extravascular events contributed to the impaired perfusion function of intraosseous blood supply system, as this was evidenced by the significantly decreased 'maximum enhancement', an index of local blood perfusion measured by dynamic MRI in ON + rabbits in the present study.

Also as demonstrated, our inductive protocol resulted in no animal death (zero mortality) as compared with an up to 50% mortality reported using a protocol of two injections of high-dose LPS combined with subsequent three injections of high-dose MPS (H-LPS \u00d7 2 + H-MPS \u00d7 3) [9] . According to the etiology of steroid-associated ON, the lower ON incidence by the protocol (H-MPS \u00d7 1) was due to lack of LPS-induced pre-thrombosis state before steroid treatment [18] . On the other hand, the higher mortality by the protocol (H-LPS \u00d7 2 + H-MPS \u00d7 3) was due to high-dose-LPS-induced severe endotoxin shock [9] . Since a single low-dose injection of LPS could induce a high incidence of ON with low mortality [10] , the present study developed a protocol by modifying the reported protocol (H-LPS \u00d7 2 + H-MPS \u00d7 3) by replacing the two high-dose LPS injection with a single low-dose LPS injection. The high incidence and even no mortality using this protocol might attribute to both combined administration of LPS-MPS and a single low-dose LPS. The significance of the protocol with high ON incidence but low or no mortality was obvious, at least including both reduction of number of experimental animals required for intervention studies and increase in validity of the evaluation results.",

However, this does not imply that ON animal models, such as the current rabbit model, are not suitable for studying pathogenesis, testing the efficacy of agents and intervention strategies developed for prevention of steroid-associated ON. In the present study, we demonstrated many histopathological and pathogenetic features of steroid-induced ON in rabbits similar to those observed in human ON prior to subchondral bone collapse [28] . Histopathologically, ON lesions were presented in multi-focal regions, including locations at both proximal and distal femur. In addition, reparative appositional bone formation also presented around the necrotic bone and reparative fibrous granulation tissues were found next to the necrotic bone resorption. Pathogenically, both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular marrow lipid deposit were found in the model. These evidences strongly supported that the steroid-induced rabbit ON model as the one developed using a unique inductive protocol would be effective to test efficacy of medications developed for prevention of steroid-associated ON for clinical application and confirmation of their long-term effects in prevention of subchondral bone collapse at hip. In fact, this is similar to OVX rat model, which has become a gold standard for preclinical efficacy studies of medications developed for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, although without being able to result in spontaneous fractures frequently occurred in osteoporotic patients [29] .",
