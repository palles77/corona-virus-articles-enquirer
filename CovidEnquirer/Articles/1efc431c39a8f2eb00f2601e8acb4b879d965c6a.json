Unlike other species, taurine is an essential amino acid in cats and the effects of feline taurine deficiency have been investigated during the last years [17] . It was shown, that a taurine-free diet has an impact on the development and function of the feline immune system in vivo [16] . Added to a lymphocyte transformation assay in vitro, taurine causes an increase in proliferation to Con A [18] . Human lymphoblastoid lymphocyte-derived ceils are also stimulated and proliferate in taurine-supplemented media [19] . In our experiments we found that the addition of taurine to culture media significantly improved the outgrowth efficiency for Ag8-derived hybridomas (Fig. 3) , but no marked effect was noticed on NSO-derived hybridomas.",

Compared to controls, cat serum had a clear growth-supporting effect in Ag8-derived heterohybridomas, but when NSO was used as parental line, cat serum obviously had a rather growth-suppressive effect. The reasons for the different modes of action of cat serum and taurine on the two fusion lines are unknown so far, but the choice of the appropriate fusion line seems to be important for the production of interspecific hybridomas. Galakhar et al. [9] found the fusion lines Ag8 and NSO to be superior to Sp2/0-Agl4 in the yield of mink heterohybridomas. Other possible influences of Ag8 or NSO on heterohybridomas, such as antibody production could not be studied in the present experiments.",

Instead, feline lymphocytes can be fused to HAT-sensitive murine myeloma lines, used in conventional hybridization experiments. The development of a panel of cat x mouse heterohybridoma lines, secreting feline monoclonal antibodies should be very useful as reference standards for distinct subclasses. A similar approach was chosen by Srikumaran et al.",
