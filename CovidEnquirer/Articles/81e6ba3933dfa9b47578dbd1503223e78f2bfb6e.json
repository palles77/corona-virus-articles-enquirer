            "text": "V iral bronchiolitis is the most frequent cause of infant hospitalization during the winter season. 1 Well-described variations in its management reflect a lack of consensus about optimal therapy, 2-5 with propensity to persist in clinical practices that may offer little benefit. 6 The intensity of therapy and investigation bears little relationship to the severity of bronchiolitis, but is a primary determinant of resource use and costs. 6 Chest radiography in bronchiolitis is strongly recommended 7, 8 and widespread worldwide. [9] [10] [11] In North America, the rate of chest radiography is variable and performed in 20% to 89% of bronchiolitis cases. 6, [12] [13] [14] Although the usual radiographic abnormalities include airway disease and atelectasis, 15 a minority of infants with bronchiolitis have both airway and airspace disease. 16 However, bacterial super-infection is uncommon in bronchiolitis, [17] [18] [19] even when airspace disease is present. 19, 20 Therefore, the main potential benefit of radiography lies in the identification of diagnoses inconsistent with bronchiolitis, such as lobar consolidation. Radiography is associated with numerous disadvantages and may also be linked to an increased use of antibiotics, both in children with bronchiolitis and in older children with suspected pneumonia. 14, [21] [22] [23] Because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate radiographic diagnoses, recent guidelines advise against the routine use of chest radiography in typical bronchiolitis. 24, 25 Earlier studies on the usefulness of radiographs in bronchiolitis were limited by the inclusion of infants with multiple wheezing episodes 25 and by insufficient power to make specific recommendations. 25, 26 A recent state-of-the-art bronchiolitis review called for further studies clarifying the usefulness of radiographs in this disease. 27 Our study investigated the rate of radiographic alternate diagnoses in infants with acute bronchiolitis (primary objective) and examined the impact of radiography on therapy (secondary objective).",

All enrolled patients were treated with 2 to 3 consecutive nebulizations of 2.5 mg/dose of albuterol (suspended in 2 mL normal saline, via Hudson Updraft nebulizer with oxygen flow 8 l/min). Thereafter, all children underwent chest radiography. To evaluate the impact of radiography on management, immediately before the radiograph the ED staff and fellows were asked about their intended use of antibiotics and disposition if no chest x-ray were available. The radiographs were interpreted by the ED staff physicians/fellows according to predetermined criteria for simple bronchiolitis, complex bronchiolitis, or diagnoses inconsistent with bronchiolitis, according to a definition, and classified by the study nurse into these 3 categories on the basis of the physicians' responses. The study nurse then re-corded the ED physicians' radiograph interpretation and subsequent disposition decision and antibiotic therapy given on the basis of this interpretation. To minimize the possibility of a significant change in the clinical status between the pre-and post-radiograph management plans, these plans were recorded immediately before and after the procedure, respectively. All radiographs were read at a later date by the primary study radiologist, who is considered to be an expert in lung disease (D.M.), according to the same criteria as used in the ED. A second senior staff radiologist (P.B.) also read the initial 242 radiographs to validate the \"expert\" reading. Both study radiologists knew the patients were suspected of having bronchiolitis, but were blinded to details of the presentation, the ED interpretation of the films, the readings of the other participating radiologist, and the routine interpretation by staff radiologists not participating in the study.

            "text": "The main limitation of this study is the lack of a diagnostic \"gold standard\" proving the absence of bacterial infection in children with complex radiographs. Ideally, the decision to do the radiography should be made after an appropriate review of the expected benefits of this procedure in each child (eg, in children with toxic appearances or those with unusual presentations or prolonged clinical courses). Also, our study had only 1 radiograph with lobar consolidation, and identification of any predictive factors for this highrisk feature was impossible. Although our recommendations are likely generalizable to non-pediatric EDs, some of our colleagues working in these settings may not feel as confident in diagnosing typical bronchiolitis and may have a lower threshold for radiography. Likewise, our colleagues in community hospitals can apply these results to their patients, provided they feel comfortable with the clinical diagnosis and adequate follow-up is provided.",
