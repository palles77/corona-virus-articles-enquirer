            "text": "Background: Kawasaki disease is the leading cause of pediatric acquired cardiac disease in many industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of Kawasaki disease in acute stages in Taiwan, by linking the diagnosis code to medication and comparing the differences in epidemiological features with those of previous reports that used the diagnosis code alone. Methods: We searched the National Health Insurance Research Database from 1997 to 2010. For the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) set, all inpatients with a main diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (ICD-9, 446.1) were retrieved. For the ICD-9 \u00fe intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) set, Kawasaki disease in acute stages was defined as the disease stages requiring IVIG. The epidemiologic features were calculated and compared by both methods. Results: The incidence rates for children under 5 years ranged from 21.5 to 68.5 per 100,000 person-years (average 49.1) for the ICD-9 \u00fe IVIG set and from 48.5 to 82.8 per 100,000 person-years (average 74.9) for the ICD-9 set. Significant discrepancy in peak season estimation occurred in summer. The 5-year recurrence rate was 1.1% for the ICD-9 \u00fe IVIG set and 4.5% for the ICD-9 set. The coronary complication rates were around 7.24% (ICD-9 \u00fe IVIG) and 6.48% (ICD-9). Conclusion: Discrepancies occurred when different case definitions were used in claims data analysis. Previous reports might have overestimated the incidence, recurrence rate, and complication rate in older children. The new method might slightly underestimate them. The true incidence might lie in between.",

Two previous reports claimed that Taiwan had the most patients in summer. 6, 19 This Table 6 Number of recurrent episodes per patient number using the ICD-9 data alone or the ICD-9 \u00fe IVIG data. may reflect that certain cases were repeatedly counted when they were not admitted for Kawasaki disease in acute stages. Our results revealed that the peak season in Taiwan was late spring to early summer (AprileJune). Spring is warm and humid in Taiwan, which facilitates the transmission of airborne infectious diseases. Moreover, our study showed that the incidence declined when the SARS outbreak occurred in 2003. Huang et al's 6 study failed to take this phenomenon into account. At the time of SARS outbreak, people, including young children and infants, were confined to their houses and came in contact with others less often. As a result, transmission of viral illness among young children might have been reduced. This provides some support to one hypothesis about the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease, which states that Kawasaki disease is an immune reaction caused by some kinds of infectious agents. 1, 15, 24 Our results using IVIG as the indicator are similar to those found in reports from Hong Kong and Beijing and somewhat different from those found in reports from Japan and Korea. 2,8e10 We believe that our results are more reasonable from both a geographic and a genetic perspective, as we mentioned above. When we counted only children older than 5 years of age, we found that the number of patients was highest in February, July, and August. These 3 months are winter and summer vacations in Taiwan. This finding might suggest that some children with a past history of Kawasaki disease were admitted for survey during their vacations. This phenomenon might have influenced the results of previous reports (Tables 4 and 5 ). 6, 19 When we used ICD-9 alone as the indicator, the recurrence rate was 5.52%. It was higher than that of a previous report by Huang et al 6 (1.5%). We believe that the discrepancy is caused by the shorter study period (2003e2006) of their report. Therefore, a certain number of patients were censored. However, the recurrence rate was 1.16% when we used IVIG as the indicator. In comparison with Japan (3%), the recurrence rate was significantly lower in Taiwan. 10 The lower incidence of Kawasaki disease in Taiwan might contribute to the lower recurrence rate. These discrepancies also reflect a possible fallacy in the methodology of previous studies. As physicians code Kawasaki disease as the main diagnosis to receive reimbursement for catastrophic disease from the Bureau of NHI and avoid peer review, the recurrence rate should have been overestimated in previous reports. 6, 19 Table 6 shows that 251 patients (1.9%) had more than two episodes of Kawasaki disease in the ICD-9 set. Kawasaki disease usually recurs only once. 10 On the contrary, if we use IVIG as the indicator, only nine patients (0.1%) had more than two episodes. We believe that the patients who had more than five episodes were outliers. However, we do not think that the estimation of recurrence rate would not be influenced significantly using IVIG as an indicator.",

However, it is hard to believe that all the patients older than 9 years were misdiagnosed and not given IVIG. Previous reports from Taiwan noted that older age, being a risk factor for complications, might actually reflect some patients who were readmitted for survey, and the disease in not for acute stages. 6, 19 The coronary aneurysm rates could be underestimated because the aneurysms could develop later, after discharge from hospital.
