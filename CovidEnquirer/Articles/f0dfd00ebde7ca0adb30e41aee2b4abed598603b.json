In some cases these infections were directly related to clinical symptoms, such as acute neonatal viremia resulting in puppy mortality; systemic viremia in naive pregnant females resulting in fetal death, abortion, and mummification; and ocular-respiratory disease in dogs of various age ranges. 12 What has changed within the past decade has been the ability to detect the virus in its subclinical state, which allows for a much clearer understanding of the importance of 2 subpopulations of dogs: carrier-shedder adult dogs, and CHVlatently infected dogs in the animal populations with which we work. 13-17 The increased sensitivity of both antibody-based serology assays and nucleic acidbased polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have increased our level of clinical inquiry regarding CHV, as well as the other canine infectious microorganisms. 18 -22 In addition to recognizing CHV adult carriers in the general population, this new momentum has allowed for clinicians to screen dogs that are undergoing",

            "text": "Consistent with the other alpha herpesviruses, CHV has a predilection for pregnant dogs and neonatal puppies. [23] [24] [25] [26] Early reports focused on the effects of CHV on various reproductive parameters in the dog, in part due to the severity of the clinical symptoms and the profound pathologic effects. In the review by Anvik, 12 acute neonatal viremia and systemic infection of na\u00efve pregnant females were regarded as 2 of the most important disease outcomes of CHV infection. The emphasis at that time was on the recognition of clinical symptoms for a rapid diagnosis. Since there are no commercial vaccines currently available for the prevention of CHV-induced disease, it has become paramount to understand the clinical features of CHV infections (see Table 1 ) and to incorporate this knowledge with sound management practices to minimize the effects on reproductive efficiency and puppy survival. 27 As was mentioned previously, this has been the primary focus of the earlier literature on CHV infections. Infection may occur during pregnancy or may be acquired by puppies during the first few weeks of life. The key feature during both of these phases is that the pregnant female and puppies are immunologically na\u00efve to CHV and therefore highly susceptible to disease. Puppies may acquire the infection in utero, from passage through the birth canal, from contact with oronasal secretions of the dam, or contact shedders. Humans may serve as fomites of the virus if attending to an adult carrier-shedder dog, and then proceeding to a nursery setting without proper disinfection. Na\u00efve neonatal puppies, younger than 1 week, are at highest risk of fatal systemic disease, while na\u00efve dogs older than 3 weeks are relatively resistant to disease but can still become infected. [27] [28] [29] Virus infection in na\u00efve older dogs is generally acquired via aerosol, so that replication occurs in the nasopharynx tonsils and retropharyngeal and bronchial lymph nodes. 2,30 -32 This respiratory site will become an important aspect of the ecology of the virus when both respiratory and ocular clinical outcomes are covered in subsequent sections.",

The CHV is usually recovered from the oropharyngeal region in these disease-resistant pups. It is generally accepted that maternal antibody and/or immune lymphocytes acquired through the milk explain why naturally infected dams that have a diseased litter will usually give birth to normal litters on subsequent pregnancies.",

This has led to strategies to naturally immunize (via contact with adult dogs) susceptible female dogs prebreeding, to screen female dogs for CHV infection (by serology and/or PCR) prior to breeding, and to use a defined quarantine period for pregnant dogs with an unknown CHV infection status. An age-risk, immunologically na\u00efve-risk strategy has been used by clinicians and clients to focus on the most susceptible time periods for disease. This time encompasses the pregnant female during the last 3 weeks prior to whelping, and her puppies up to 3 weeks post whelping. 12, 27, 33 This understanding has constituted the rationale for the \"6-week danger period.\" 12, 27 The primary contributing risk factors that allow for CHV infection and disease are kennel size, hygiene, and kennel cough. All 3 of these are important in the spread and retention of CHV in high-risk dog populations. While the controversy over CHV being a significant contributor to the kennel cough syndrome has been an ongoing debate (see subsequent section on respiratory-ocular infections), it should be noted that CHV was initially reported as a respiratory pathogen as early as it was a reproductive pathogen. 2 The data from Ronsse and coworkers 22 support the contention that CHV is primarily maintained and spread among dogs in a multidog environment as a respiratory infection.",

            "text": "Infection rates, based on serologic studies, are high enough to explain entry of CHV into multidog environments, either as an active infection or as the result of reactivation of latent virus in environments associated with natural, or pharmacologically induced immunosuppression. In Belgium the seroprevalence in adult dogs was found to be 45.8%. 22 Rijsewijk and colleagues 21 reported a seroprevalence of 39% in the Netherlands. Reading and Field, 20 using an antibody detection ELISA, found a seroprevalence of 88% in the United Kingdom. In Japan, the seroprevalence was recently reported to be 21.7%. 6 Since CHV is regarded as a weak immunogen, these antibody-based surveys are probably an underrepresentation of the true infection rate in the dog populations. 33 Canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) is most commonly seen in rescue centers, boarding kennels, and veterinary hospitals. Most of the affected dogs have a dry cough of limited duration. In complicated cases, bronchopneumonia is seen and can be fatal. Multiple infectious agents can play a role in the induction of CIRD. Canine parainfluenza virus and Bordetella bronchiseptica are frequently involved. Canine distemper and canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) have been associated with CIRD but are not routinely detected due in part to effective vaccines, and the population immunity is fairly high. Canine influenza, canine respiratory coronavirus, and, most recently, canine pneumovirus, are emerging components of CIRD, which have added to the complexity of this disease syndrome. 18, 19, 40 Although CHV infections have been documented in multidog environments, its etiologic role in CIRD is still being assessed. During a 2-year longitudinal study of viruses associated with CIRD at a rescue center in the United Kingdom, CHV was found in 12.8% of the tracheal samples examined and in 9.6% of the lung samples. Infections with CHV were seen 3 to 4 weeks after entry and were associated with more severe respiratory signs. 18 The delay in detection of the virus by PCR was corroborated by the serologic data, which also indicated that CHV infections occurred at a later time point. A possible explanation offered for its detection in more severe cases was the possibility that latent CHV could have been reactivated as a result of the stress induced by a primary CIRD episode that was triggered by other viral or bacterial agents. The virus source was not determined. The authors speculated that genetically different CHV strains would have been detected if the source of virus was the result of reactivation of latent virus from different dogs. It has been reported, however, that CHV strains show very low sequence variability. 41 Erles and Brownlie 19 monitored dogs in 2 training centers in the United Kingdom for 1 year. All dogs were vaccinated against CAV-2, CPV-2, and Leptospira interrogans. Tonsillar swabs and serum samples were collected at entry and every 3 months thereafter. Blood samples were collected at entry and every 4 weeks thereafter. Most CIRD cases were observed in autumn and winter. Most dogs were healthy at arrival and were in the kennel for at least 2 weeks before developing clinical signs. Seroconversion to CHV was detected throughout the year. The most logical explanation for the seroconversion pattern would be continuous introduction in the kennel by acutely infected dogs or reactivation of latent virus in the resident population. The authors concluded that while CHV contributed to the CIRD, it was not an obligate pathogen in that environment, since some asymptomatic dogs also seroconverted. Kawakami and colleagues 6 described an outbreak of infectious tracheobronchitis in Japan accompanied by death in adult dogs. The only pathogen identified during the outbreak was CHV. Molecular testing led to the conclusion that a single strain was involved, with virulence characteristics that were only slightly higher than those of previously tested CHV strains. As was the case in the study reported by Erles and colleagues, 18 it was not clear whether the virus was introduced into the center in the form of acute infections or was the result of reactivation of latent infections in the resident population. Regardless, the authors emphasized that there was sufficient amounts of immunosuppression in shelter populations to allow for CHV to be a significant primary pathogen in that environment.",

Punctate keratitis is the earliest detectable CHV corneal ulceration and appears clinically as a fine stippling of epithelial loss. This subtle lesion is often clinically overlooked when examination is performed without the aid of magnification, but application of corneal vital stains (particularly rose Bengal or lissamine green) facilitate detection. 47 As punctate ulcerations progress, they form the classic alphaherpesvirus corneal lesion of dendritic corneal ulcers. Dendritic corneal ulcerations are strongly suggestive of CHV infection in the dog. These linear, branching ulcers stain brightly with sodium fluorescein, rose Bengal, and lissamine green (Fig. 6) . 7, 47 Prominent terminal end bulbs are a consistent feature of CHV dendritic ulcers in the dog and can be used to differentiate CHV corneal lesions from other potential causes of linear corneal ulcers that might appear clinically similar (eg, external trauma, cilia abnormalities, entropion). Terminal end bulbs are club-shaped, rounded ends to the CHV dendritic ulcer branches, and are not seen with other causes of linear corneal ulcers. Coalescence of dendritic ulcerations may result in the formation of geographic corneal ulcers. 47 These appear as larger, irregular-shaped areas of corneal epithelial loss. In dogs with CHV ulcerative keratitis, corneal ulcers are commonly located in discrete groups or linear arrangements on the corneal surface. Unless complicated by secondary bacterial infection, CHV corneal ulcers remain superficial and corneal stromal loss is not appreciable. Nonulcerative keratitis is a less frequent lesion reported with CHV ocular infection. 47 Clinically, nonulcerative keratitis appears as a circumferential ring of cornea stromal neovascularization with epithelial and subepithelial leukocyte infiltrates in the peripheral cornea. Nonulcerative keratitis may represent a resolution stage of active corneal epithelial disease.",

The clinical severity of ocular lesions peak approximately 7 to 10 days after infection and lesions slowly resolve over the following 2 weeks. Histopathologic findings in dogs with acute experimental CHV conjunctivitis include conjunctival epithelial necrosis, subepithelial lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration, and edema of the substantia propria. 28, 29 Experimental induction of recurrent ocular CHV infection was demonstrated by administering immunosuppressive dosages of systemic corticosteroids to latently infected dogs recovered from primary CHV ocular infection. 8 Recrudescent CHV ocular disease was detected in 83% of immunosuppressed dogs in one study. 8 Bilateral conjunctivitis or linear corneal ulcers developed as early as 3 days after initiating corticosteroid administration. The mean duration of detectable ocular disease was 8.6 days and was shorter than the experimental primary ocular CHV infection in the dogs. Cellular lesions observed by in vivo confocal microscopy in the dogs included conjunctival leukocyte infiltrates, corneal leukocyte infiltrates, abnormal corneal epithelial cell morphologies, and corneal Langerhans cell infiltrates. Subsequent research determined topical ocular corticosteroid administration does not result in recurrent CHV ocular disease in latently infected dogs under experimental conditions. 15 In this study, topical ophthalmic prednisolone acetate (1.0% suspension) was administered 4 times daily for 28 days to both eyes of dogs with experimentally induced latent CHV infection. Viral shedding and recurrent CHV ocular disease were not detected; however, crystalline corneal opacities developed in some dogs. These bilateral corneal lesions appeared clinically as subepithelial and anterior stromal punctate, white, refractile opacities within the central cornea. It was unclear if the crystalline corneal opacities were a nonspecific result of corticosteroid administration or influenced by prior CHV corneal disease.",

Although clinical signs were not observed, infectious virus was isolated from swabs until 4 to 6 days postinoculation. Tissues were collected 2 to 4 months postinoculation and examined for the presence of latent viral DNA. It was determined that the trigeminal ganglion (TG) was an important latency site for CHV, regardless of the inoculation route. Latency was detected also in lumbosacral ganglia of 2 of 3 dogs inoculated intravaginally, 1 of 2 dogs inoculated intranasally, and 1 of 3 dogs inoculated both intranasally and intravenously. Abortion and stillbirths could also be associated with reactivation of latent CHV, but the mechanism by which this takes place has not been investigated. Retropharyngeal lymph nodes were another important latency site, since latency was detected in this tissue in 7 of 8 dogs. Conversely, all attempts to demonstrate latency in peripheral blood lymphoid cells were negative.",

Parzefall and colleagues 50 reported on the prevalence of canine herpesvirus DNA in the vestibular ganglia (VG) and vestibular labyrinth (VL) of 52 dogs that were included in their study. CHV DNA was detected in the VL of 17% of the dogs and in the VG of 19% of the dogs. Although no attempt was made to differentiate between acute and latent infection, it is very likely that the PCR was detecting latent virus. Interestingly, infection of the VG or VL was not always associated with infection of TG. Since the VG, in contrast to the trigeminal and geniculate ganglia, do not have direct connection with sensory nerve endings on body surfaces, it remains most probable that there was primary infection of the TG or geniculate ganglia, with subsequent spread to the VG.",

The tissues most commonly found to be positive were lumbosacral ganglia, tonsil, parotid salivary gland, and liver. Based on the data, lumbosacral ganglia are an important site of latency and potential source of reactivated virus for venereal infections and infection of pups as they pass through the birth canal. Finding of latent virus in tonsils and salivary glands points to the role of oronasal spread in the transmission of CHV. It was noted that viral DNA was detected in the trigeminal ganglia extracts of only 2 of the dogs. None of the 12 blood samples tested were found to be positive, indicting a lack of detectable viremia. The authors commented that CHV is either totally absent from peripheral blood or that the level of infection is limited to 1 genomic copy per 2000 mononuclear cells. They also pointed out that basing the incidence of CHV infection on serology only may lead to an underestimation of the true infection rate.",

However, despite the fact that samples were taken at regular intervals, the results of PCR testing with a previously validated assay were uniformly negative both on all nasal and vaginal swabs and buffy coat samples.

A fluorogenic real-time PCR assay was described by Reubel and colleagues 52 and reported to have a detection limit of 10 copies of viral DNA. The first probe-based multiplex real-time PCR for CHV was reported by Ledbetter and colleagues. 8 Very recently, Decaro and colleagues 14 reported the development and complete validation of a probe-based real-time quantitative PCR for the detection and quantitation of CHV DNA in clinical samples. The assay was found to be very sensitive, since it could detect as few as 10 copies of the target per sample. In comparison with the gel-based PCR assay described by Schulze and Baumg\u00e4rtner, 17 which was used in parallel, this assay has a 10-fold lower detection limit. Specificity for CHV was very high, as determined by lack of amplification of other canine viruses. The dynamic range was validated by successful amplification of a number of CHV-positive samples from different geographic locations. Reproducibility of the assay was determined by determining both intra-assay and interassay variability between the results obtained with samples containing variable amounts of target DNA. Both intra-assay and interassay variability, expressed as a coefficient of variation, were fairly low, were dependent on the target concentration, and were found to increase with decreasing target copy numbers. A potential pitfall of PCR assays is that the sample contains substances that are inhibiting the reaction, thus potentially leading to false-negative results. To control for this possibility, an internal control construct was spiked into each sample at known quantity and co-amplified. This way, any inhibition would be readily detectable from a decrease in the expected signal resulting from the amplification of this internal control. A relatively simple way to avoid inhibition was to prepare a 10-fold dilution of the sample.",

Latent CHV infection can be reactivated, with induction of viral shedding, by short durations of corticosteroid administration in some dogs; however, other dogs are resistant to corticosteroidinduced viral reactivation. 8, 51, 54 When naturally infected mature bitches that previously aborted CHV-infected pups where experimentally immunosuppressed by a 5-day course of systemic corticosteroid administration, CHV was shed from the nasal, oral, ocular, and vaginal mucosa. 51 Viral shedding could not be induced in all dogs. Viral shedding was detected by virus isolation as early as 5 days, and as late as 20 days, after initiating corticosteroid administration. The duration of detected CHV shedding ranged from 1 to 7 days in individual dogs. In a similar study 54 using 3-month-and 2-year-old dogs experimentally infected with CHV by nasal and intravenous routes, CHV reactivation and mucosal viral shedding were repeatedly induced by systemic corticosteroid administration.

A second round of corticosteroid administration was administered 3 months later and again resulted in viral shedding in some, but not all, dogs. The duration of viral shedding was shorter in all dogs during the second experimental reactivation and was associated with a tendency for lower viral titers.",

As was mentioned earlier, the reproductive diseases associated with CHV were the initial driving force behind the recognition of the economic and emotional effects upon dog owners. While the costs of CHV-associated reproductive diseases have not been reported, it would be conceivable that a dam that loses an entire litter to CHV would result in a loss of $10,000, since multiple puppies are involved. In cases of respiratory disease and ocular disease, the costs of treatment and long-term care of recurrent infections may exceed $1000 per case.",

This has been a key factor in understanding the virus and controlling it. The virus maintains itself in subclinical carrier dogs by way of latency. It may be exacerbated throughout life by stress, which results in mild to severe clinical symptoms that most commonly affect the respiratory and ocular systems. Concurrent with these clinical episodes there is shedding from excretions and secretions to susceptible dogs.

Viral replication is reduced at elevated body temperatures and there are lower morbidity and mortality rates in dogs that are subsequently infected; however, this is ineffective for individual dogs if implemented after viral infection. 23 Intraperitoneal injection of immune sera obtained from CHV-seropositive dogs is described as a method to reduce mortality in an exposed litter, but it must be administered prior to infection to be most effective. 26 Lactoferrin possesses in vitro antiviral activity against CHV and inhibits cellular infection. 56 Administration of lactoferrin to dogs at risk for infection could theoretically provide protection; however, this is not demonstrated in vivo. Isolated reports of apparently successful therapy of neonatal CHV infection with the antivirals vidarabine and acyclovir are described. Acyclovir was administered orally as a 10-mg total dose per dog at 6-hour intervals until 3.5 weeks of age. 26 The pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of intravenous, subcutaneous, and oral acyclovir were investigated in dogs. 57, 58 Additionally, a sustained release buccal tablet form of acyclovir was evaluated in the dog. 59 Acyclovir is bioavailable when administered orally to dogs and is widely distributed within tissues; however, target plasma concentrations and effective dosages for CHV infection are currently unknown. [57] [58] [59] Acyclovir toxicosis resultant from accidental ingestion is reported in dogs with dosages as low as 40 mg/kg and the routine clinical use of this, and other systemic antiviral medications, in dogs for CHV infection requires further investigation of safety and efficacy. 60 The canine pharmacokinetics of newer-generation antiherpesviral drugs, including famciclovir, are reported. Similar to acyclovir, safe and effective doses for dogs with CHV infection are undetermined. 61 Treatment of respiratory and genital CHV infection is primarily symptomatic. Unless complicated by secondary bacterial infection, these conditions are typically selflimiting and specific antiviral therapy is not reported. In contrast to respiratory and genital infection, there are detailed reports of the successful clinical management of ocular CHV infection. In addition to nonspecific treatments to prevent secondary bacterial infection (topical ocular antimicrobials) and improve comfort (topical ocular atropine), antiviral therapy with 0.1% idoxuridine or 1% trifluridine ophthalmic solution was used. Idoxuridine and trifluridine are nucleoside analogues, possess good anti-herpesvirus activity, and are well tolerated by dogs when applied topically as ocular formulations. Trifluridine is available under the trade name Viroptic, and idoxuridine can be acquired from compounding pharmacies. Both antivirals are administered 6 to 8 times daily for the first 48 hours and then 4 times daily until resolution of clinical signs of active infection. Cidofovir 0.5% ophthalmic solution is an alternative ophthalmic antiviral for CHV ocular disease that is effective with twice daily administration (E.C. Ledbetter, unpublished data, 2011) .",
