            "text": "The ability to rapidly assemble and prototype cellular circuits is vital for biological research and its applications in biotechnology and medicine. Current methods that permit the assembly of DNA circuits in mammalian cells are laborious, slow, expensive and mostly not permissive of rapid prototyping of constructs. Here we present the Mammalian ToolKit (MTK), a Golden Gate-based cloning toolkit for fast, reproducible and versatile assembly of large DNA vectors and their implementation in mammalian models. The MTK consists of a curated library of characterized, modular parts that can be easily mixed and matched to combinatorially assemble one transcriptional unit with different characteristics, or a hierarchy of transcriptional units weaved into complex circuits. MTK renders many cell engineering operations facile, as showcased by our ability to use the toolkit to generate single-integration landing pads, to create and deliver libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs, and to iterate through Cas9-based prototype circuits. As a biological proof of concept, we used the MTK to successfully design and rapidly construct in mammalian cells a challenging multicistronic circuit encoding the Ebola virus (EBOV) replication complex. This construct provides a non-infectious biosafety level 2 (BSL2) cellular assay for exploring the transcription and replication steps of the EBOV viral life cycle in its host. Its construction also demonstrates how the MTK can enable important and time sensitive applications such as the rapid testing of pharmacological inhibitors of emerging BSL4 viruses that pose a major threat to human health. and Extensible Mammalian Modular Assembly kit (EMMA) 3 based on Golden Gate assembly reactions were proposed. Both methods use sets of modular parts with given functionality, which can be assembled directionally into transcription units (TUs) by type-IIS restriction enzymes. While useful, all three methods have important shortcomings. GMAP requires sequencing in between all cloning steps, which makes the method slow and expensive. EMMA and mMoClo provide a method to hierarchically assemble DNA vectors that encode large circuits, but fall short on shareability, integration of Cas9 sgRNA cloning, a library of tested parts, and ease of use. While in yeast and plant systems, methods for the rapid, efficient and hierarchical assembly of genetic circuits from a large library of well described modular parts [8] [9] [10] [11] exist, we are unaware that such a cloning toolkit for mammalian systems is readily available.",

It is required to generate DNA vectors that can encode a myriad of genetic circuits with applications in the fields of cell biology, therapeutics, virology, synthetic biology and biotechnology, among others. These circuits can encompass the expression of endogenous proteins, small RNAs, reporters of gene expression or cellular activity, and other innumerable reagents whose applications extend from basic discovery to medical applications. To move molecular cloning forward into an engineering discipline, with minimal trial and error and reproducible results, the parts that constitute engineered circuits need to be modular, vetted for their function and easy to share. To maximize the range of applications, circuits made from these parts need to be rapidly assembled, amenable to fast prototyping, and not bottlenecked by the delivery method to their target genomic integration sites.",

We transiently transfected each multi-TU plasmid into HEK293T cells and normalized the mAzamiGreen expression by mScarlet to control for plasmid copy number.

The ranked expression strength of the promoters revealed a smooth continuum of expression between 10-fold and 300-fold (Fig. 2a) . Thus this suite of promoters can be used to tailor TU expression levels and leverage overlapping promoter strengths to avoid repeated elements in multi-TU plasmids. The ranked expression of the promoters across human and mouse demonstrates that their relative strengths are largely maintained (Fig. Supplementary   Fig. 1a, b) , suggesting that these promoters are portable across different systems.

We observed a range of 4-fold change in expression of mAzamiGreen among the three conventional 3' UTR sequences.

To test the toolkit's ability to produce skipped proteins from one RNA, we built a multicistronic vector with one CAG promoter driving membrane-tethered iRFP713, cytoplasmic mAzamiGreen, mCerulean-tagged p38 KTR 15 , and histone H2B fused to mScarlet separated by P2A sites (Fig. 3a) .

Transiently transfected HEK293T cells with the multicistronic vector showed the correct localization of each of the proteins (Fig. 3b) , with no distinguishable difference from the independent multi-TU control.

We verified the correct integration of the landing pad cassette by PCR in 8 clones ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ) and continued its characterization in clone #8 due to the monoallelic presence of the landing pad. We further confirmed the presence of the landing pad in the cell line by mRuby2 expression (Fig. 4b) .",

However, the degree of activation and repression varies considerably across each circuit. More specifically, dSpCas9 achieves approximately 3-fold reduction in fluorescence through the KRAB effector and 30-fold induction in both the UAS and TRE promoters. In contrast, the dSaCas9 fused to VPR is an effective activator increasing expression 30-fold, but when fused to a KRAB domain, dSaCas9-mediated repression is comparable to background FP expression levels. The data also suggests that the TRE promoter exhibits higher basal activity due to its overall greater repression, and lower activation when compared to the UAS promoter. This information, in light of other considerations such as protein size or protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence versatility, expedites the rational design and optimization of Cas9-controlled gene expression circuits through the parallelization of prototyping. As a result, this strategy can serve as a useful reference for further customized circuits, and a demonstration that this prototyping can be scaled to easily screen various combinations of genetic circuits.",

In transient transfections, all ZEBOV-4cis constructs showed no impact on cell viability and displayed levels of minigenome activity similar to the 6-plasmid system and ~40-60-fold higher activity than the cells lacking Lpol (Fig. 7b, Supplementary Fig. 5b ).",

ZEBOV-4cis stable populations and clonal cells yielded comparable nLuc minigenome reporter activity (Fig.   7d ). ZEBOV viral proteins in both the stable and clonal cell populations were readily detectable with NP and VP35 specific antibodies, and showed expression levels similar to transiently transfected ZEBOV-4cis (Fig. 7e) . Additionally, based on the presence of 2A peptide tag that remains at the C-terminus of each of these proteins following \"self-cleavage\" due to ribosome skipping, NP, VP35, and VP30 were each detectable with an antibody raised against the 2A peptide (Fig. 7e) . Larger multi-ORF fusion protein products were not readily detected with the 2A peptide antibodies, indicating efficient cleavage occurred at each of the P2A sites encoded within the ZEBOV-4cis construct. This demonstrates the added benefit that the P2A parts in the MTK provide a potential \"universal\" method to detect protein expression from multicistronic constructs. This is especially useful for analysis of novel emerging viruses or other proteins where specific antibodies are not available.",

ZEBOV-4cis stable cells were transfected with the ZEBOV nLuc minigenome reporter and treated with DMSO (1%, control), Gedunin (5 \u00b5M), or 6-Azauridine (5 \u00b5M) for 2 days.

We independently transduced the four control viruses in HEK293T cells expressing tagBFP, mScarlet and spCas9 (3C cell line) and quantified tagBFP and mScarlet expression two weeks after transduction. Cells that contained the non-targeting sgRNAs expressed high levels of both tagBFP and mScarlet (Fig. 5d, first panel). Cells expressing the tagBFP-targeting sgRNA showed reduced expression of tagBFP in 86% of the population (Fig. 5d, second panel),while only 27% of cells showed reduced expression of mScarlet when its guide was expressed(Fig. 5d, third panel). Accordingly, when both guides were co-expressed, only 31% cells show reduced expression for both proteins, while most cells had reduced tagBFP(Fig. 5d, fourth panel).We used these results to build a linear classifier that would allow us to use the observed tagBFP and mScarlet expression to determine the likely sgRNA that each cell received in a population transduced with the full sgRNA library. Due to the inefficient targeting of the mScarlet guide, the linear classifier had an average precision of 0.62 and an average recall of 0.58(Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 4). This classifier, which was trained on the individual targeted variants of sgRNA, predicted higher than expected proportions of non-targeting and tagBFP sgRNA-expressing cells when presented with an equal proportion of each variant of the library.",

We demonstrated how these could be easily combined to construct and recycle TUs of different properties, including different levels of gene expression or multicistronic rapid implementation of these assembled DNA vectors, we included in the MTK lentiviral, recombinase and Cas9 delivery vectors. These vectors allow the user to choose between transient and stable integration of the same circuits, as well as their copy number. Due to the modularity of the MTK, it is straightforward to generate new variants of these vectors, which we demonstrated by creating BxBI landing pads (LP) for the hAAVS1 locus. These vetted, modular parts constitute fundamental tools for the rapid and facile assembly of genetic circuits.We illustrated this point in two ways: first, we assembled a combinatorial library of transcriptional units that encode different proteins or guide RNAs; second, we combinatorially assembled new circuits that use different MTK parts. Such libraries are generated through the MTK in a straightforward way, reproducing all variants included in the combinatorial assembly process and maintaining their ratios through all the cloning steps. While our studies tackled a small set of demonstrations, it is clear that many new combinatorial libraries can be built with any parts in the MTK as it currently exists, or as users add to its parts. For example, introducing a panel of C-terminal fluorescent protein tags into the MTK would only require a one-time PCR and sequence verification for each tag to \"domesticate\" the series as 4a Parts. Additionally, the facile assembly of sgRNAs expedites the production of expression vectors that are easily amenable to CRISPR screens of all scales. With the multitude of ways to multiplex this construction, many TUs and circuits can be built, screened and rapidly prototyped.Despite the modularity in the MTK, there are situations where caution is needed in using certain parts. For example, on occasion, internal BsaI and BsmBI sites must be removed from coding sequences with a synonymous mutation. For non-coding sequences, it is often difficult to foresee the impact of base switching during domestication of the corresponding part. It is possible to domesticate these parts and retain internal BsaI or BsmBI cut sites with a minor",

The capabilities provided in the MTK are particularly relevant in the context of infectious disease outbreaks where time is of the essence. Recent years have seen outbreaks of new and re-emerging viruses including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Zika virus, Lassa Fever virus, and Ebola virus, among others, where approved treatments are oftenlacking. Responding to and containing such outbreaks is an important public health challenge that demands rapid production and iteration of naturally occurring viral circuits in mammalian host cells to enable discovery of inhibitors and investigation of the basic biology of the emerging pathogens. Importantly, given that discovery or availability of a virus sequence does not necessarily correlate with successful culturing of the virus in a lab, the need to test multiple strains and clinical isolates that are also optimized for expression in cell culture is paramount and presents a scaling challenge for conventional cloning approaches. Features unique to the MTK such as multicistronic TU assembly, modular delivery into cells, and facile library generation, in combination with automated workflows, can enable faster iteration over these circuits to quickly identify the optimal reagent for downstream efforts and analyses. Using Zaire Ebolavirus (ZEBOV) as a model, we generated cell lines stably expressing the ZEBOV replication complex components in days, while maintaining a library of these components for future applications and iteration. These cell lines are functional, showing minigenome reporter activity comparable to previously described 6-plasmid transient and stable systems. The",
