            "text": "UR present knowledge of how and when newly synthesized integral membrane proteins are integrated into the lipid bilayer stems mostly from studies with mammalian endoplasmic reticulum. For numerous proteins a signal recognition particle-dependent integration into microsomal vesicles has been demonstrated (2, 3, 6, 21, 25, 26, 33, 34, 44, 45, 48, 53) . In all but one case (2) , these proteins are synthesized without a cleavable signal sequence, suggesting that the signal recognition particle must recognize an internal segment of the amino acid sequence functionally equivalent to a signal sequence. The signal recognition particle dependence of the membrane integration is also consistent with the notion that the integration of membrane proteins into and translocation of secretory proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane initially proceed along the same molecular pathway (5) . Only the interruption of an ongoing translocation process by distinct stop-transfer sequences emerging on the translocated polypeptide chain would lead to anchorage within the membrane proteins (5, 14, 63) . The final topography of a given membrane protein appears to depend on structural features determining the orientation of the most proximal transmembrane segment (NH2 terminus inside or outside) and on the number of internal signal and stop-transfer sequences (4, 21) .",

Outer membrane proteins of gram-negative bacteria are in a sense secretory proteins because they have to traverse the plasma membrane before reaching the outer membrane. As such, they are synthesized with cleavable signal sequences and require two forms of energy and active SecA and SecY proteins for their export, On the other hand, most inner membrane proteins (1, 7, 17, 18, 22, 30, 32, 46, 52, 60) are not proteolytically processed when incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. The only representative of these proteins studied in detail so far is the bacterial signal peptidase (leader peptidase, signal peptidase I). The NH2-terminal third of the polypeptide chain has been reported to anchor the enzyme within the plasma membrane with the remainder extending into the periplasm. Integration requires a membrane potential as well as SecA and SecY (summarized in 59).",

The mobility on SDS-PAGE of the in vitro-synthesized lactose permease (33 kD) is in good agreement with values reported previously for the native enzyme isolated from membranes (18, 61) , which reflects the fact that the enzyme is synthesized without a cleavable signal sequence (8, 18) .

            "text": "Synthesis of lactose perrnease in the S-135 occurred in a largely membrane-free environment. This is indicated by the finding that the S-135-in contrast to an S-30 used by others (18)-does not contain detectable amounts of signal peptidase activity (35) . Furthermore, an absence of membranes from the S-135 is suggested by the different temperature sensitivities observed for native and in vitro-synthesized lactose permease. In accordance with what had previously been described for this (54) and other membrane proteins (27) , lactose permease derived from [3H]NEM-labeled membranes could only be detected if boiling before electrophoresis was avoided ( Fig. 1 a, compare lanes 6 and 7). On the other hand, the protein synthesized in our in vitro system proved to be completely insensitive to heat ( Fig. 1 a, lanes 4 and 5) . This finding is consistent with different conformations of lactose permease depending on whether it is embedded in the lipid bilayer of the membrane or synthesized in vitro in a lipid-free milieu. Clearly, the availability of a membranefree in vitro system was a prerequisite to demonstrate integration of lactose permease into exogenously added membrane vesicles. Fig. 1 b, like all subsequent figures, shows in vitro synthesized lactose permease after resolution by SDS-PAGE in the presence of urea. Under these conditions the/acYtranslation product migrated with increased mobility as a 29-kD protein ( Fig. 1 b, lane 2) . This protein, however, was also pGM21 specific: the parental plasmid pACYC184 lacking the intervening lacY gene, gave rise to the 25-kD chloramphenicol acetyltransferase protein (Fig. 1 b, lane/) . The 29-kD pro- tein directed by pGM21 comigrated with the [3H]NEMlabeled lactose permease integrated in vivo into membranes ( Fig. 1 b, compare lanes 2 and 4) and was recognized by anti-lactose permease antibodies (Fig. 1 b, lane 3 ). Since these antibodies recognize only the COOH-terminal peptide of lactose permease (47) , their interaction with the in vitrosynthesized lactose permease is the strongest indication for the 29-kD protein being the full-length transcription-translation product of the lacY gene. The weak antigenicity of in vitro-synthesized lactose permease ( Fig. 1 b, compare lanes 2 and 3) might be the result of an aggregation of the protein (see below) which buries most of the COOH termini. This view is supported by the much higher antigenicity of lactose permease integrated in vivo into membranes (Fig. 1 a, lanes  2 and 3) properly exposing the COOH-terminal epitope. The nature of the nonantigenic, pGM21-dependent, 7-kD protein ( Fig. 1 b, lane 2) which was consistently produced is not clear; it could be an NH2-terminal fragment of lactose permease due to premature termination.",

            "text": "To find out whether the 29-kD translation product could integrate into plasma membranes from E. coli, inverted plasma membrane vesicles (INV) were added during or after the in vitro synthesis of lactose permease. It was apparent that because of the lack of a cleavable signal sequence (8), integration into membranes would be difficult to ascertain experimentally, since it would not simply be indicated by proteolytic maturation nor was the integrated protein expected to be completely protease resistant, like proteins sequestered within the lumen of the vesicles. In addition, cosedimentation, as a means to demonstrate membrane integration, also proved to be of no use. When in vitro reactions were resolved by centrifugation into soluble and pelletable subfractions, as shown in Fig. 2 , the bulk of lactose permease (LacY) was recovered from the sedimentable fractions, irrespective of whether INV were omitted or added coor posttranslationally (Fig. 2 , compare lanes 1-3 with lanes 4-6). However, it was possible to discriminate between lactose permease sedimenting with INV, added either co-or posttranslationally, if the sediments were digested with proteinase K (Fig. 2 , lanes 7and 8) or thermolysin (Fig. 2 , lanes 9 and 10). When INV were present during synthesis, both proteases digested the 29-kD lactose permease almost completely, giving rise to a number of proteolytic fragments, the most prominent of them being a 13-kD peptide (Fig. 2, lanes  8 and 10) . Very little of this 13-kD cleavage product was found in the digests of reactions, in which INV were added posttranslationally: the 29-kD lactose permease was in these cases largely resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 9) . The same result was obtained with lactose permease kept as a control in the complete absence of INV (Fig. 2, lanes 11  and 12) . The 13-kD degradation product is likely to be the NH2-terminal, ~x,140-amino acid, stable peptide obtained under a variety of proteolytic conditions (50) .",

This does not apply to peripherally associated membrane proteins and proteins entrapped in closed membrane vesicles which usually are opened up during carbonate treatment. The applicability of this method to INV from E. coli was verified using in vitro-synthesized alkaline phosphatase, the precursor of which is proteolytically processed upon translocation into INV (Fig. 3, lane 7;p and m) . When translation products were separated into soluble and pelletable proteins, all of the mature enzyme sedimented with INV (Fig. 3, lane 9) , while most of the precursor remained in the supernatant (Fig. 3 , lane 8) as expected for a translocatexi protein (35) . (Reasons for the appearance of precursor in the pellet fraction [Fig.  3 , lane 9] are indicated in the legend to Fig. 3) . If, however, centrifugation was preceded by treatment with Na2CO3 at an alkaline pH, roughly 50% of the mature, INV-enclosed alkaline phosphatase was released into the supernatant (Fig.  3, compare lanes 10 and 11 with lanes 8 and 9) . It is not clear why part of the mature alkaline phosphatase remained in the pellet, but this could be due merely to an incomplete separation of the two phases.

This Na2CO3 resistance was not mimicked by a conceivable denaturation, and hence aggregation, of lactose permease after being liberated from a loose membrane association by Na2CO3: the protease sensitivity, characteristic of cotranslationally integrated lactose permease (Fig. 2, lanes  8 and 10) , was maintained during Na~CO3 treatment.",

This experiment was designed to allow separation of membrane-associated from aggregated permease. To prepare an INV-enriched subfraction, total translation products (Fig. 4, tot) were resolved into soluble (sol), membrane-associated (mbs), and pelletable (pel) material by means of centrifugation through a two-step sucrose gradient in the airfuge, as outlined in Materials and Methods. The expected resolution into the three subfractions was first confirmed for the outer membrane protein LamB (Fig.  4 a) , in which the presence of INV was verified by signal peptidase activity: almost all the mature LamB, generated by cleavage of the signal peptide upon transport into INV, was recovered from the membrane fraction. Subfractionation of lactose permease, synthesized in the absence of INV, revealed that (similar to the results depicted in Fig. 2 ): 82 % pelleted (Fig. 4 b) , 14% remained soluble, and negligible amounts (4%) sedimented with the carrier INV added. When INV were added cotranslationally to the in vitro translation reaction (Fig. 4 c) , 51% of the lactose permease was now found in the membrane fraction at the expense of pelletable enzyme (37%), while the soluble fraction (12%) remained constant. (A comparison of the results illustrated in b and c also demonstrates how few endogenous INV are present in the S-135). After posttranslational incubation with INV ( Fig.  4 d) , 82% of lactose permease was recovered from the pellet, whereas part of the soluble lactose permease was now found associated with INV (13 % in Fig. 4 d compared with 4 % in Fig. 4 b) .",

            "text": "To corroborate that small amounts of nonaggregated lactose permease could posttranslationally associate with INV, soluble lactose permease was obtained by high-speed centrifugation of translation products synthesized in the absence of membranes. (Soluble lactose permease thus prepared appears [ Fig. 4 e, lane/] as a much more intense band than previously [ Fig. 4 b; sol] because of a comparably long exposure of the X-ray film.) When this material was incubated for an additional 30 min in the absence of INV and subse- quently subjected to differential centrifugation, yielding only a supernatant and a pellet fraction, it remained entirely in the supernatant (Fig. 4 e, lanes I and 2) . A small amount of soluble enzyme, however, became pelletable upon incubation with INV (Fig. 4 e, lanes 3 and 4) , which must reflect INV association since no aggregation occurred under these conditions (Fig. 4, lane 2) . These results unequivocally demonstrate that a posttranslational membrane association of lactose permease can occur only from a soluble protein pool, which because of the centrifugation conditions of the experiment depicted in Fig. 4 e is likely to be ribosome free. This posttranslational association of lactose permease with INV was also Na2CO3 resistant (see legend to Fig. 4 e) , suggesting true incorporation into the lipid bilayer. A substantial posttranslational integration of lactose permease into INV, however, was obviously prevented by the extensive denaturation of the hydrophobic protein in the aqueous environment ( Fig. 4 d) , a phenomenon which is likely to hold true for many other membrane proteins. Clearly, the best way to test whether or not a membrane protein has correctly integrated is to examine its biological activity. To this end, an established assay for the lactose permease-dependent uptake of ['4C]lactose into INV (31) was adapted (Tables I and II ). This assay makes use of the enzyme-catalyzed, facilitated diffusion of substrate down a concentration gradient, leading to an accumulation of substrate within INV, until the exterior and interior concentrations are balanced. Subsequent poisoning of lactose permease by Hg 2+ prevents later efflux of substrate during recovery of the INV, so that quantitation of the INV-associated radioactivity reflects uptake of [~4C]lactose into the lumen of the INV, provided that the obtained values are corrected for unspecific binding (controls in which Hg 2\u00f7 was given before the substrate). As shown in Table I , INV prepared from the lactose permease-overproducing strain T206 accumulated [14C]lactose, which was abolished by inhibiting lactose permease with NEM and substantially reduced by the substrate analogue/3-galactosyl 1-thio-/3-D-galactoside. No radioactive substrate remained within INV when treatment with Hg 2+ was omitted. Most importantly, INV pre- pared from strain MRE 600, which had not been induced for the synthesis of lactose permease, did not accumulate significant [t4C]lactose, clearly indicating that the uptake of radioactivity into T206-INV was dependent upon the presence of lactose permease. To find out whether in vitro-assembled lactose permease was active, MRE 600-INV that had been present during synthesis of lactose permease were collected from fivefold scaled-up reactions and subjected to the [J4C]lactose uptake (Table II) , MRE 600-INV accumulated radioactivity if biosynthetically reconstituted with lactose permease. No accumulation occurred either if lactose permease was not synthesized because of an absence of the lacY DNA, or iflNV were omitted. As expected for the enzyme-mediated reaction, uptake of radioactivity was subject to inhibition by NEM. Therefore, the INV-associated radioactivity is the result of an enzymecatalyzed transport of ['4C]lactose into INV, demonstrating that in vitro-synthesized lactose permease can assemble into isolated membrane vesicles in a native (i.e., functional) configuration.",

This was verified by (a) a proteasecleavage pattern closely related to that of the in vivo enzyme which requires the exposure of a distinct domain with a cluster of proteolytic cleavage sites (50); (b) the solubilization by detergent; (c) the resistance towards Na2CO3 extraction, frequently used to probe membrane integration (3); (d) the recovery of lactose permease from a membrane-enriched subfraction of the in vitro reaction mix (the last two criteria were first examined for their suitability by the use of known exported proteins as controls); and (e) the enzymic activity of in vitro-integrated lactose permease.

Accordingly, the small amount of posttranslationally assembled lactose permease, detectable when membranes were isolated from the reaction mix (Fig. 4) , was most probably derived from a soluble lactose permease pool. These results emphasize that, at least with hydrophobic proteins, the issue of whether incorporation into the lipid bilayer occurs concurrently with or subsequently to protein synthesis is merely academic. Rather, it seems likely that a mechanism operates which avoids the release of a nascent polypeptide chain from the ribosome until after the initiation of membrane integration, thus preventing denaturation in the aqueous milieu of the cytoplasm. This would also explain the recently described posttranslational integration of the human glucose transporter into mammalian endoplasmic reticulum that was demonstrated to occur efficiently only for a truncated form lacking the COOH-terminal 30 % of the molecule (34) .",

It is conceivable that it is through an association with unfolding or renaturing proteins, such as those recently postulated (19, 42, 43) and described (10, 11, 13, 16, 65) both for prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Interestingly, soluble lactose permease was found to be largely protease resistant (Ahrem, B., and M: MOiler, unpublished results) similar to what has been described for the association of M13 precoat with a 70-kD heat shock protein (65) . The markedly different efficiencies of co-vs. posttranslational integration of lactose permease into INV suggest that renaturing activities must be low in the in vitro system described herein, whereas molecular components presumably involved in cotranslational integration of lactose permease into INV appear to be rather active. Whether this implies that different molecular pathways exist for the two temporal modes of protein integration also in vivo, cannot be answered by the in vitro studies presented here.",

            "text": "Integration of lactose permease into INV does not require the H+-motive force. This finding is in remarkable contrast to all the other bacterial export proteins studied so far in vivo and in vitro (summarized in 37). Even inner membrane proteins such as the M13 major coat protein and the signal peptidase (59), appear to depend on a membrane potential for proper assembly. That integration of lactose permease into INV, observed under conditions which dissipate the H +motive force, might not lead to an authentically structured enzyme, are unlikely; protease-sensitive membrane association of lactose permease was found to occur both with native and deenergized INV, and this property was shown for native INV to correlate with the enzymatically active tertiary structure of the protein. Unfortunately, enzymatic activity could not be measured with DCCD-treated INV, because of an interference of DCCD with the uptake assay. A search for structural differences between lactose permease, on the one hand, and coat protein and leader peptidase, on the other, regarding their different requirements for a membrane potential, reveals that the major part of the leader peptidase molecule is not embedded in the membrane, but has to be translocated into the periplasm (59) . It might be that this channeling of numerous polar residues through the membrane requires a H\u00f7-motive force. Although the 50-amino acid coat protein does not exhibit large translocated domains, it is noteworthy that the presumably translocated part of the molecule contains several (mostly negatively) charged amino acids, one of which, when changed to an uncharged residue, renders integration of the coat protein independent of the membrane potential (64) . Provided that our results obtained by use of an in vitro system truly reflect in vivo conditions, polytopic transmembrane proteins lacking extensive stretches of charged residues, such as the lactose permease, might in fact integrate into the bacterial plasma membrane without the aid of the H\u00f7-motive force.",
