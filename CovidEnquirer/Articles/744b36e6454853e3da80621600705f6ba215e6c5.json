Several reports suggested the epidemiological association of FeMV infection with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in cats. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and the genetic diversity of FeMV as well as the relationship between FeMV infection and CKD in cats from Northern Italy. Urine (n = 81) and kidney samples (n = 27) from 92 cats admitted to the Veterinary Teaching Hospital of the University of Milan between 2014 and 2017 were investigated for FeMV infection. FeMV RNA was detected in one urine sample (1.23%; 95% CI: 0.03-6.68%) and in two kidneys (7.40%; 95% CI: 0.91-24.28%). FeMV RNA was revealed only in urine or kidneys of cats without evidence of CKD. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the three strains clustered with FeMV strains retrieved from public database, forming a distinct sub-cluster of FeMV. The presence of distinct genotypes of FeMV found in this study is in accordance with previous studies demonstrating that FeMV strains are genetically diverse. A clear relationship between the presence of FeMV infection and CKD in the cats from Northern Italy was not observed, confirming recent reports that do not support the hypothesis that FeMV infection is associated with the development of CKD.",

            "text": "Morbilliviruses belong to the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family Paramoxyviridae, which is composed of enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses (de Vries et al., 2015) . Morbilliviruses infect humans (e.g. Measles morbillivirus) and animals (e.g. Canine distemper virus, Peste des petits ruminants virus) . Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) was firstly isolated in Hong Kong between 2009 and 2011, mainly in urine, and a role of this virus in the pathogenesis of feline tubular interstitial nephritis (TIN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) was postulated (Woo et al., 2012) . Two years later, FeMV was isolated in Japan with a prevalence of 6.1% in urine, 10% in blood and 40% in kidneys with nephritis (Furuya et al., 2014) . Up to date, FeMV has been identified also in USA, South America, Turkey and Europe, with sequences closely related to previously identified FeMV strains (Lorusso et al., 2015; Sieg et al., 2015; Sharp et al., 2016; Darold et al., 2017; Yilmaz et al., 2017; McCallum et la., 2018) . Sieg et al (2015) found in cats from Germany viruses with sequences different from any other morbillivirus and with a nucleotide homology close to bat and rodent paramyxoviruses, thereby named feline paramyxoviruses (FPaV). The same authors found a correlation between FeMV and FPaV presence in urine and CKD (Sieg et al., 2015) . Recently, a high prevalence of FeMV was found, but without a strong correlation between TIN and infection (Park et al., 2016) . Moreover, Yilmaz et al (2017) did not find any significant difference in both histopathological and clinico-pathological findings between FeMV infected and not infected cats (Yilmaz et al., 2017) . In addition, no relationship between the shedding of the virus in urine and laboratory alterations imputable to CKD were found in recent studies (Darold et al., 2017; McCallum et al., 2018) .",

Even if a kidney biopsy was not performed, the fact that the cat continued to shed the virus in the urine for 14 days, led the Authors to suggest a possible role of this virus in the development of renal failure (Lorusso et al., 2015) . FeMV is now cited as a possible cause of CKD, which is a very common feline disease, with a multifactorial and still unclear pathogenesis (Brown et al., 2016) . However, only few studies on FeMV provided information about cats signalment and anamnesis, as well as on clinicopathological changes related to FeMV infection. Moreover, data regarding the correlation between CKD and FeMV infection are often discordant and they have not been investigated in Italy yet. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the presence of feline paramyxoviruses in Italy with molecular methods, regardless of the presence of clinical signs consistent with CKD, to perform molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis and to evaluate the existence of a correlation between paramyxoviruses infection and clinicopathological as well as histopathological changes imputable to renal damage.",

This finding could be explained by the population of cats included in the current study, since it is believed that stray cats are more easily infected, and most of the cats included in the current study were client-owned (Furuya et al., 2014) . In fact, when considering the FeMV prevalence on the population of stray cats included in this study, which should also be considered when evaluating the circulation of a virus in a given geographic area, the prevalence increases to 16.7% (1/6: 95% CI: 0.42-64.12%).",

It was demonstrated that samples with low titres of FeMV RNA can result positive at quantitative PCR (qPCR) but negative at RT-PCR (De Luca et al., 2018; Furuya et al., 2015) . However, this hypothesis seems unlikely since previous studies reporting slightly higher prevalences were done with conventional PCR. Moreover, the overall prevalence recently obtained with qPCR was only slightly higher compared whit the prevalence registered with conventional PCR (De Luca et al., 2018) . Unfortunately, we were not able to perform serological tests on the cats used in this study, therefore no data about the seroprevalence are available. Nevertheless, based on other studies reporting a higher rate of seropositivities in FeMV RNA positive cats, it can be assumed that a low seroprevalence would have been recorded, but this needs to be investigated in further studies (Woo et al., 2012; McCallum et al., 2018) . Further studies should also evaluate the presence of other unrelated feline paramyxoviruses (FPaV) previously described in cats (Sieg et al., 2015) , that were not investigated in this study.",

Long-term shedding of FeMV through the urine has been reported, showing similarity between FeMV in cats and canine distemper virus in dogs (Elia et al., 2015) . The analysis of a follow up sample demonstrates that the cat either stopped to shed the virus or intermittently shed the virus, as described in a recent study evaluating the viral RNA shedding within a 110 days' time span; although a previous study demonstrated the persistent shedding of FeMV RNA within a two-years period De Luca et al., 2018) . However, the above-mentioned study evaluated the type of shedding in one cat only, thus more information on this issue are needed. The detection of FeMV in a cat with cholangitis suggests designing future studies to investigate whether the virus may be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic disorders. The presence of FeMV in the liver of infected cats, most of which were affected by cholangiohepatitis, was already demonstrated through immunohistochemistry (Yilmaz et al., 2017) . Moreover, studies in vitro demonstrated that FeMV may have tropism for several cellular lines therefore being potentially able to infect different organs (Sakaguchi et al., 2015) . The cat with FeMV-positive urine had no medical requirements to perform a kidney biopsy. Therefore, it was not possible to rule out histological signs of tubular damage and to correlate FeMV infection with kidney damage. Similarly, the rapid recovery of symptoms associated with liver diseases hampered the possibility to further investigate through biopsies or other techniques the possible presence of the virus within the hepatic tissues.",

Veterinary Microbiology 233 (2019) [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] does not allow to find a correlation between FeMV infection and granulomatous inflammation, both because of the scarce number of kidneys examined and because it was not possible to perform FeMV immunohistochemistry to investigate the presence of viral antigen inside the inflammatory lesions. However, in other studies based on immunohistochemistry, the FeMV antigen has been observed in the cytoplasm of tubular cells. It would be interesting to study whether the morbillivirus may be observed in other cellular lines of infected kidneys, as it is known that FeMV is also capable of infecting monocytic/ macrophagic line cells, which are abundant within granulomatous lesions (Woo et al., 2012) . It is also interesting to notice that the only two FeMV positive cats did not show the typical pattern of interstitial nephritis thought to be associated with FeMV infection according to Woo et al (2012) , while many cats (13/27) had histological patterns consistent with interstitial nephritis but were FeMV negative. Unfortunately, urinary bladders were not collected, but it would have been interesting to evaluate FeMV presence also in this organ.",

The recorded data suggests the presence of a FeMV sub-cluster well distinct from the strain previously isolated in southern Italy. Possible differences in the behavior of these strains may be suggested and need to be investigated in the future. As our findings did not correlate FeMV infection with renal disorders, the possible role of the virus as one triggering factor of a disease with such a multifactorial pathogenesis as CKD, remains uncertain.",
