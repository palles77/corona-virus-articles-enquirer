Later, they performed an international, double-blind RCT, which shown that hIVIG had similar safety outcome of death and adverse events (15) . Furthermore, Beigel et al did a multicenter phase 2 trial and found that immune plasma provided support for a possible benefit of severe influenza (19).

Therefore, for patients with COVID-19, clinicians should take such previous findings carefully into considerations before the use of convalescent plasma in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The composition of the plasma is complex. And the antibodies produced by the human body are matched with its own immune system. Transfusion reactions may occur in blood products administration (20, 21) . In addition, the titers of the antibody from convalescent may differ from each other. The standardized extraction and purification specific antibody may be a difficult and time consuming work, which might not suitable for the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, pilot study and control trials should be carried out to identify the optimal timing, dosage and indications in the use of H-IVIG/immune plasma in patients with COVID-19.",

No serious adverse events was reported.The use of immune plasma has been recommended as a primary therapy for severe respiratory infectious diseases, including influenza, SARS, and MERS (9,13,   19). However, data supporting these recommendations are weak and limited to case reports, case series without control. For patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), we did not identify any report of convalescent plasma use for these patients in publication. Up to present, there an open-label, non-randomized clinical trial (NCT04264858) and a multicenter, randomized and parallel controlled trial (ChiCTR2000029757) was designed and registered. However, it may take time to perform such clinical trials in recruiting patients and collecting convalescent plasma. Therefore, in order to provide implications of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 clinical practice, we try to carry out a meta-analysis and systemic review only included RCTs of influenza to better evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma.",
