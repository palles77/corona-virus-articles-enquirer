Children are more susceptible to URTIs because their immune system is not fully mature with increased exposure to viral infections and other social and environmental factors. 2 Tonsillitis is an inflammation of the pharyngeal tonsils. The inflammation usually reaches the adenoid and the lingual tonsils; so the term tonsillopharyngitis is usually used. 3 Recurrent tonsillitis is defined as repeated attacks of acute tonsillitis with periods with only very few, or without any symptoms. 4 Recurrent tonsillitis has some sequelae and complications including:",

It is widely distributed in the whole body, achieving higher concentrations in tissues and thus serum delivery to infected tissue is further enhanced by inflammatory processes. 22 AZT used for rheumatic fever prevention for a long time before. In our study; we adopted a new regiemen for prevention of recurrent tonsillitis in pediatrics; patients received (60 mg/Kg) prophylactic dose of AZT divided on 6 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Patients received AZT alone had significant less tonsillitis attacks and less severe symptoms than patients who didn't receive any prophylaxis during the same period of the study. El Hennawi et al. 18 in their study concluded that AZT is effective in prophylaxis against recurrent tonsillitis with a great benefit for better QOL compared to patients who had tonsillectomy, however; they used the prophylactic regimen of rheumatic fever prevention (once weekly AZT) 23 and they didn't include a control group in their study. Casey and Pichichero 24 reported that AZT treatment for GABHS tonsillopharyngitis in children and adults is more effective than other treatment regimens in providing clinical cure of tonsillopharyngitis. 13 reported that 15.4% of their patients with established rheumatic heart disease had recurrent tonsillitis with once weekly AZT dose. In our study; patients still had tonsillitis attacks with AZT use. Why AZT failed to prevent tonsillitis completely is not very clear. One possibility is that drug dosage was too widely spaced. Though AZT has a long half-life, drug concentration might not have been adequate. AZT when administered at 60 mg/kg per course (i.e. 20 mg/kg for 3 days, 12 mg/kg for 5 days or 10mg/kg for 6 days) in children was superior to the 10-day course of penicillin, however; 3-days AZT regimen was inferior to 5 and 6-day regimens, also 30 mg/kg per course was inferior to the 10day courses of penicillin. 24 AZT treatment may be required in higher doses and for longer duration to be effective in recurrent tonsillitis prevention, so we used 60 mg/kg prophylactic dose divided on 6-days.",

In leucocytes; AZT accumulates predominantly in lysosomes, whereas intracellular GABHS is found in phagosomes and cytosol. 28 In a recent study we reported that adult patients with recurrent tonsillitis may have higher incidence of humoral antibody deficiency compared to their age and sex-matched controls. 29 From this point; we used Echinacea as an adjunct to AZT in a trial to enhance patients immunity.",

The medicinal properties of Echinacea were first recognized in the eighteenth century by Native American tribes who used the plant to treat snake and insect bites, coughs, colds and typhoid J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fever. Echinacea has numerous claimed medicinal properties including: anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. It has immune stimulating properties and can reduce the severity of symptoms and duration of the common cold and flu, especially if used in the early stages of infection.30 There are no data in the previous literature (up to our knowledge) on combined use of AZT and Echinacea in recurrent tonsillitis prophylaxis. In this study; patients with combined AZT plus Echinacea had significant better results compared to patients with AZT alone. This effect of Echinacea can be attributed to several major constituents of Echinacea identified and reported to be biologically active: Caffeic acid derivatives thought to contribute to the claimed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Echinacea, Alkamides thought to have stimulatory effects on the cells of the immune system and Polysaccharides reported to act on the immune system to boost its effects. The active constituents of Echinacea may strengthen the immune response by interacting with various cells of the specific and non specific immune system and through activation of macrophages, natural killer cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes.31 On the basis of this limited information, we suggest the possible value of Echinacea added to documented value of AZT in preventing tonsillitis in children.One factor affecting the validity of studies is the quality of the Echinacea material used in clinical trials. Echinacea's immune stimulating properties are dependent on the presence of certain active constituents. Research into the quality of herbal products revealed that only 28% of Echinacea products tested contained the same amounts and types of constituents as listed on the label. This could explain why Echinacea is effective in some trials but not in others. ) family should avoid Echinacea as few cases of Echinacea induced anaphylaxis, asthma attack; urticaria and contact dermatitis have been reported. Echinacea can interfere with drugs metabolized by an enzyme family known as the cytochrome p450 system and thus prolong their action.36 When AZT was combined to Echinacea in this study; no interactions reported and efficacy of both drugs were maintained. The development of resistant bacteria with prolonged antibiotic use is well established. Xavier et al.37 studied the Long-term AZT therapy in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and repeated exacerbations, they reported that long-term intermittent AZT therapy, administered three times a week at a dosage of 500 mg, is well tolerated and associated with significant reductions in acute exacerbations of COPD, number of hospitalizations and days of hospital stay with no development of resistant bacteria.",
