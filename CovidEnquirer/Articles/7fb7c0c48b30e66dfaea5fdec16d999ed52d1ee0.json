Without public health control or selfprotective measures, the epidemic was likely to grow in a relatively large rate. The R0 estimates and the rapid growth of epidemic curves both indicates the disease transmissibility. Thus, control measures as well as self-administered protective actions are crucial to reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19 and thus mitigate the outbreak size and prevent for further burden. Given the superspreading is unlikely to occur, we can be confident to control the COVID-19 outbreak by reducing the reproduction number to below unity. .
