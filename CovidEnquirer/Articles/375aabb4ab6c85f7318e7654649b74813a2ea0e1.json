SSPE patients as well as SAME rats revealed oligoclonal, intrathecal antibody synthesis with MV specificity. SAME rats synthesized MV-specific antibodies intracerebrally to a higher extent than SSPE patients. Although a restricted isoelectric pattern of MV-specific antibodies was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SSPE patients as well as of SAME rats, the heterogeneity within clusters of immunogiobulin bands was higher in the rat specimens. Increase in the blood-brain barrier permeability for albumin was exclusively detected in SAME rats but not in SSPE patients. These data suggest that the rat model offers excellent opportunities to study the initial humoral events in MV-induced encephalitides.",

The infection is virologically characterized by restricted envelope gene expression, the absence of infectious virus particle formation and a pronounced intrathecal antiviral immune response, which fails to overcome the infection (ter Meulen et al., 1983) . So far, the pathogenic mechanism which leads to MV persistence is unknown, but it has been suggested that viral antibodies play an important role in the establishment and maintenance of this infection (Fujinami and Oldstone, 1984) . In tissue culturc. extracellular MV antibodies can cause an antigenic modulation, which results in persistence and interferes with viral replication (Barrett et al., 1985) . Similar mechanisms may be of significance in SSPE, but these cannot be evaluated in this disease since the early state of CNS infection is clinically not detectable. Therefore. these aspects can only be studied in an experimental model.",

Like in SSPE, infectious measles virus cannot be reisolated from diseased brain areas by conventional methods and the virus cell interaction reveals a restriction of MV gene expression. In infected brain cells only measles virus nucleocapsid (N) and phosphoprotein (P) can regularly be detected, whereas the levels of hemagglutinin (H), fusion (F) and membrane (M) proteins are either drastically reduced or not detectable. Since the state of MV replication is similar to the one described in SSPE, it was the aim of this study to characterize the intrathecal immune response in SAME diseased rats in comparison to SSPE. The data obtained indicate that SAME in Lewis rats represents an excellent model to evaluate the role of the intracerebral immune response in subacute CNS diseases induced by MV.",

Increased permeability was detectable with normal lg ratio (rats No. 5 and 6) or proportional increase of the Ig ratio (rats No. 7 and 16), as well as in relation to disproportional increase of the lg ratio (rats No. 17 and 20). Intrathecal synthesis of Ig and increased permeability for albumin was found in five rats (Nos. 4, 11, 14, 15 and 18) . Together, almost 50% of the animals (9/20) revealed a dysregulated BBB. Rats No. 9, 10, 12 and 19 synthesized lg intrathecally with a normal BBB permeability, whereas rats No. 1, 2, 3, 8 and 13 were within the normal range of CSF/serum ratios for albumin and immunoglobulin.

A similar phenomenon occurred in MV-infected rats. Almost all SAME rats developed significant MV-specific titers in serum and CSF, but not to the same high levels as observed in SSPE samples. However, with respect to MV-specific AB indices, rats revealed much higher ratios than SSPE patients, indicating a very strong intrathecal synthesis of MV-specific antibodies in the animals. This result suggests that SAME in rats represents probably the early events of a subacute MV-induced encephalitis, whereas SSPE reflects the late consequences of a subacute encephalitis, characterized by the presence of a few CNS-residing, antibody-secreting B cell clones, highly selected over the years by the persistent presence of a restricted pattern of MV-specific proteins in brain cells.",

This observation seems to rule out the possibility that beside MV-specific antibodies, non-virus-specific antibodies have been produced in significant amounts in the CNS. This is in contrast to coronavirus JHM-induced encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats. In this model, JHM virus causes extensive primary demyelination in the CNS which is sometimes accompanied by an intrathecal synthesis of non-virus-specific immunoglobulins of restricted heterogeneity in the absence of JHM-specific antibody clones (Drrries et al., 1986) .

However, the development of this subacute encephalitis could only be detected in animals which were pre-immunized with an MV vaccine.

This is the area where oligoclonal IgG bands from most inflammatory disorders of the CNS in man are detected. To date, there is no satisfying explanation for this clustering of oligoclonal bands in the alkaline area of the pH gradient. As discussed by Walsh et al.

Although SAME rats showed similar results, subtle differences were detectable concerning the isoelectric distribution of MV-specific bands. As in SSPE, clusters of focused bands were detectable, but the heterogeneity within these clusters seems to be higher in CSF of SAME rats. This again supports the interpretation that SAME in rats is reflecting the early stages of a subacute encephalitis, where infiltrating B cell clones are not yet selected as in SSPE. Moreover, CSF clones in rats were detected predominantly in area It (pH 7.3-8.2) of the gradient. Since the same observation has been made in coronavirus-induced subacute encephalomyelitis in Lewis and BN rats (D/3rries et al., 1986, 1987) , and Ig clones from serum usually do not focus at higher pH values, it seems that rat immunoglobulins are confined to a narrower pH band than human antibodies.",

In view of similarities between SAME and SSPE with respect to the virus-specific CNS-resident antibody response and the restriction of expression of MV-specific genes in the infected brain tissue, this animal model will provide the opportunity to obtain insight into the potential role of the MV-specific antibody response in the CNS as a modulating factor in chronic persistent MV infection of the brain cells.",
