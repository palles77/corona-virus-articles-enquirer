In pigs, the newly emerged porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and reemerged porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) reported in the US and Asia, as well as the discovery of novel CoVs in wild bats or birds, has necessitated development of improved detection and control measures for these CoVs. Because the previous pancoronavirus (panCoV) RT-PCR established in our laboratory in 2007-2011 did not detect deltacoronaviruses (\u03b4-CoVs) in swine fecal and serum samples, our goal was to develop a new panCoV RT-PCR assay to detect known human and animal CoVs, including \u03b4-CoVs. In this study, we designed a new primer set to amplify a 668 bp-region within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene that encodes the most conserved protein domain of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-CoVs. We established a one-step panCoV RT-PCR assay and standardized the assay conditions. The newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay was demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity. Using a panel of 60 swine biological samples (feces, intestinal contents, and sera) characterized by PEDV, PDCoV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus-specific RT-PCR assays, we demonstrated that sensitivity and specificity of the newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay were 100%. 400 avian fecal (RNA) samples were further tested simultaneously for CoV by the new panCoV RT-PCR and a one-step RT-PCR assay with the \u03b4-CoV nucleocapsid-specific universal primers. Four of 400 avian samples were positive for CoV, three of which were positive for \u03b4-CoV by the conventional RT-PCR. PanCoV RT-PCR fragments for 3 of the 4 CoVs were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of one \u03b3-CoV and two \u03b4-CoV in the sequenced samples. The newly designed panCoV RT-PCR assay should be useful for the detection of currently known CoVs in animal biological samples.",

The epidemiological investigation and phylogenetic analysis of CoVs revealed that bats are the likely natural host for the \u03b1-CoVs and \u03b2-CoVs, while birds are the suspect host for \u03b3-CoVs and \u03b4-CoVs (Bolles et al., 2011; Woo et al., 2012) . To date, there are six CoVs that cause respiratory tract illness in humans, including \u03b1-CoVs, human CoV (HCoV)-NL63 and HCoV-229E, and \u03b2-CoVs HCoV-OC43, HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) . In pigs, there are also two \u03b1-CoVs and one \u03b4-CoV that cause enteric disease: porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), respectively . The other swine \u03b1-CoV, porcine respiratory coronarivurs (PRCV), and the swine \u03b2-CoV, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), induce respiratory and neurological diseases in pigs, respectively (Saif et al., 2012) .5",

Thus, the development of molecular methods to detect a broad-range of CoVs, including previously unidentified CoVs, in biological samples from animals is a critical initial step to prepare for potential epidemics by newly emerging CoVs. Previously, a one-step RT-PCR with the pancoronavirus (panCoV)-specific forward (IN-2deg; GGGDTGGGAYTAYCCHAARTGYGA) and reverse (IN-4deg; TARCAV-ACAACISYRTCRTCA) universal primers targeting a 452-bp fragment of the polymerase gene was used to detect a bovine-like \u03b2-CoV in the diarrheic feces of a giraffe (Hasoksuz et al., 2007) and an \u03b1-CoV in mink feces (Vlasova et al., 2011) . Our preliminary studies revealed that the previously established panCoV RT-PCR assay failed to detect the newly emerged PDCoV in the diarrheic pig feces, although the feces were positive for PDCoV RNA by PDCoV-specific RT-PCR. However testing for \u03b1-CoVs (PEDV and TGEV), \u03b2-CoV (bovine enteric CoV; BCoV), and \u03b3-CoVs [avian infectious bronchitis (IBV), and turkey CoV (TCoV)] was positive.",

In our study, we demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of our newly established panCoV RT-PCR assay to be 100%. The data indicate that the performance of the newly designed panCoV RT-PCR assay was comparable to that of the conventional virus-specific RT-PCR assay previously reported Kim et al., 2000; Song et al., 2015) . Because PDCoV could be of avian origin, we also tested the archival avian fecal RNA samples by the newly designed panCoV RT-PCR assay for the detection of \u03b3and \u03b4-CoVs, and a one-step RT-PCR assay with the \u03b4-CoV nucleocapsid-specific universal primers was used to detect \u03b4-CoV simultaneously. We found that the newly designed panCoV RT-PCR assay also successfully detected avian \u03b3and \u03b4-CoVs in avian fecal RNA samples, and the two assays had the same results for detection of the \u03b4-CoV positive samples.",

CoVs are frequently detected in the feces of wild birds, which may act as reservoirs for avian \u03b3and \u03b4-CoVs analyse (Duraes-Carvalho et al., 2015; Torres et al., 2017) . Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two isolates clustered in the \u03b4-CoVs genus and had the closest relationship with wild avian CoV strains, indicating the existence of \u03b4-CoV in avian fecal samples from the US. The other one belonged to the \u03b3-CoV genus. Complete genome sequencing of these 3 avian CoVs is needed to further characterize these new strains.",
