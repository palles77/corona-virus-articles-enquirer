Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three urban and two rural communities in Korea. Interviews were conducted with 3462 individuals (1608 men and 1854 women) aged ! 19 years during FebruaryeMarch 2010. Influenzarelated information including anxiety, preventive behaviors and their perceived effectiveness, vaccination status, past influenza-like illness symptoms, and sources of and trust in information was obtained. Results: Among 3462 participants, 173 reported experiencing influenza-like illness symptoms within the past 12 months. The mean H1N1 preventive behavior score was 25.5 AE 5.5 (out of a possible 40). The percent of participants reporting high perceived effectiveness and high anxiety was 46.2% and 21.4%, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, H1N1 preventive behavior scores were predicted by a high (b Z 3.577, p < 0.001) or moderate (b Z 2.529, p < 0.001) perception of their effectiveness. Similarly, moderate (b Z 1.516, p < 0.001) and high (b Z 4.103, p < 0.001) anxiety scores predicted high preventive behavior scores. Conclusion: Effective methods of promoting population behavior change may be nationwide campaigns through mass media, as well as education and promotion by health care providers and broadcasters.",

Although the Korea Center of Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) downgraded the pandemic alert from \"serious\" to \"attention\" 5 months after the influenza was first reported in Korea, they recommend a continuation of preventive behaviors such as hand washing, using a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and reducing outings when experiencing respiratory symptoms. These recommendations, which were disseminated through the mass media, were given because the spread of influenza A/H1N1 virus and prevalence of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) had recently increased [2, 5] .",

In the UK, < 40% of the public followed the recommended guidelines for preventing swine influenza during the outbreak [8] .

The CHS used a two-stage sampling process. The first stage was to apply a probability proportional to size sampling strategy (to select primary sampling units) and the second stage was to apply systematic sampling (selecting households). The sampling frame was based on 2009 Resident Registration Data. There were 22,088 primary sampling units, each containing five households. Thus 110,440 households were selected for interviews, and 230,716 individuals (107,080 men and 123,636 women) aged ! 19 years completed the interview-based survey. For this study, an additional survey was conducted on residents of three urban and two rural areas that were randomly selected from the CHS. There were 300 primary sampling units, each containing five households. Thus 1500 households were selected for interviews, and 3462 individuals (1608 men and 1854 women) aged ! 19 years completed the additional survey. The survey was conducted during FebruaryeMarch 2010. All participants gave their written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the KCDC.",

Sex, region, age, marital status, housing, and education (! 7 years) were significant predictors of behavior scores in all models (all p < 0.05). After controlling for these variables, moderate (b Z 2.529, p < 0.001) and high (b Z 3.577, p < 0.001) perceived effectiveness scores were associated with higher preventive behavior scores. Similarly, moderate (b Z 1.516, p < 0.001) and high (b Z 4.103, p < 0.001) anxiety scores were associated with higher preventive behavior scores (Table 4 ).

A recent randomized trial showed that a combination of facemasks and hand hygiene among the contacts of influenza cases reduces transmission within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms [13] . In our study, 70.3% of respondents said that during the H1N1 pandemic they washed their hands with soap more often than usual, 19.2% said that they often cleaned frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, 22% said that they reduced their use of public transport, and 31% said that they avoided crowded places. Our participants also showed a high level of behavioral compliance, i.e., they put what they said into practice. In a cross-sectional telephone survey spanning the UK, only 28.1% of respondents said that they washed their hands with soap more often than usual during the H1N1 pandemic, whereas 17.3% responded that they often cleaned frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, and only 3.7% said that they avoided crowded places [8] . In our study, 2679 (77.4%) respondents said that they put at least one of the eight preventive actions into practice (\"strongly agree\" or \"tend to agree\") and 275 (7.9%) said that they performed all eight actions. In the UK-based study, 4.9% of respondents performed at least one of six avoidance behaviors and 37.8% performed at least one of three recommended behaviors [8] . The results of that study differed from ours in that most of their respondents (62.0%) said that they did not perform any of the preventive actions. The discrepancies between the two study results can be first explained by ethnic differences in the study populations. Although our study population was all Korean and thus difficult to compare with other ethnicities, the UK-based study made a distinction between white and other ethnicities. Although most of their respondents were white (92.6%), the people in the \"other\" category were 3.2 times more likely to put the recommended behaviors into practice, and 4.1 times more likely to carry out avoidance behaviors than the white respondents. Second, there is a difference in the survey methods used between the two studies. Our study was based on face-to-face interviews and the study in the UK was based on telephone interviews. Third, considering that all of the studied countries conducted extensive nationwide campaigns about the recommended behaviors, the differences between the two results may be partly explained by differences in perceived effectiveness and anxiety between [14] . During the H1N1 epidemic in Hong Kong, only 26.8% of respondents believed that they might become infected with the virus [10] . Similarly, a study showed that although 43% of respondents thought that becoming infected with the H1N1 influenza would severely affect their health, only 21% of them thought that they might become infected [14] . In our study, although 33% of respondents thought that becoming infected with the H1N1 influenza would severely affect their health, a comparatively high 54% of the respondents believed they might become infected.",

Consistent with the findings of other studies, we found that individuals show higher behavioral compliance when the perceived effectiveness of these measures and H1N1-related anxiety levels are higher. We need to increase the understanding of the effectiveness of preventive measures, and facilitate a realistic perception of personal risk of becoming infected with H1N1 among people with the following characteristics: male, living in a rural area, single, uneducated, living in a house, and poor engagement in health behaviors.
