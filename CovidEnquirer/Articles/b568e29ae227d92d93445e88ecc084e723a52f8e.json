Recent largest and most wide-spread outbreak of EV-D68 associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) occurred in North America. Present report describes a case of EV-D68 associated severe acute respiratory illness from India with a whole genome sequence. The case was identified through retrospective analysis of Influenza SARI surveillance sample collected during September 2017 using Next Generation sequencing. EV D68 positive child aged two years and presented with asthma like symptoms for which he was admitted to ICU. The child tested negative for Influenza, RSV, Rhinovirus, PIV, hMPV and adenovirus, on real time RT-PCR. And on NGS full EV D68 genome was retrieved belonging to sub-clade B3. In ICU, child received anti-bacterial and anti-viral therapy. The child recovered with-out any sequelae and was discharged one week later. Present report highlights the importance of studying this emergent virus EV-D68 through prospective studies to understand the burden and epidemiological pattern in the country and its implications.",

After its discovery, EV-D68 detection has rarely been reported for causing any respiratory illness. But since the early 2000s, there have been several clusters of EV D68 associated respiratory illness reported from various countries [2] . In 2014 [August-October], the largest and most widespread outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) occurred in North America, affecting over 1153 people in 49 states and 14 deaths [3, 4] . Similar reports of respiratory illness by EV-D68 have been documented in Europe, Thailand, China, New Zealand and several African countries [5] . Increasing number of EV-D68 associated severe respiratory infection cases and neurological complications has raised concern in the international community [6] .",

Collected Nasal/ throat swab are processed using real time RT-PCR for the panel of respiratory viruses viz Influenza A and B, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Para-Influenza 1-4 (PIV), Adenovirus, Rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and corona-virus. To discover the unknown RNA or DNA viral or bacterial agents from the test negative samples, a retrospective analysis/testing was performed using NGS on randomly selected 18 test negative samples (2% of the total negative samples) representative of the whole year i.e. two sample per month from Influenza season months which are February to April and July to September while one sample per month from rest of the non-season months.",

Parents gave history of child having chills, nasal discharge and cough with sputum. There was no history of diarrhea or vomiting. On general examination, the child was conscious and cooperative; pallor was present, axillary temperature measured 38.8 \u2022 C, respiratory rate was 40 per min, pulse rate 110/min, Body mass index and mid arm circumference was 15.6 kg/m 2 and 12.4 cm respectively. There was no evidence of cyanosis, icterus, clubbing or any significant lymphadenopathy. On respiratory system examination, chest in-drawing was present, focal chest signs showed grunting, wheezing and crepitation. No abnormalities were detected on systemic examination. Hematological analysis revealed decreased hemoglobin level (7.6 mg %) with raised White Blood cell (WBC) Count (13 thousand/ micro liter) and platelet count was normal (387000/ micro liter).

RNA quantification, RNA depletion, library preparation, and RNA library quantification were performed [7] . The samples were loaded on the Illumina Miniseq platform for sequencing. The reads generated from the machine was analyzed using the CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC, version 10.1.1). De novo contigs of size greater than 1000 nucleotide were generated which were further identified by performing BLAST. The causative agent was identified to be Human EV-D68 after performing the BLAST search of 109 contigs.

A bootstrap replication of 1000 replication was used for the statistical assessment of the generated tree.

In recent years, there has been significantly increased in EV-D68 associated respiratory illness from around the world [11] . Increased EV-D68 detection in recent years may be because of availability of EV D68 specific RT-PCR. However, the retrospective analysis done on the stored samples in China suggested that the EV D68 detection has been increased in recent years only [12] . The mechanism underlying the recent global increase in EV D68 has not been understood.
