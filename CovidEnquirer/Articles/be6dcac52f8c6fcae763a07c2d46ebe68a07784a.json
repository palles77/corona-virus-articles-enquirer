            "text": "Turkey coronavirus (TCoV), one of the least characterized of all known coronaviruses, was isolated from an outbreak of acute enteritis in young turkeys in Ontario, Canada, and the full-length genomic sequence was determined. The full-length genome was 27,632 nucleotides plus the 3 poly(A) tail. Two open reading frames, ORFs 1a and 1b, resided in the first two thirds of the genome, and nine additional downstream ORFs were identified. A gene for hemagglutinin-esterase was absent in TCoV. The region between the membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein genes contained three potential small ORFs: ORF-X, a previously uncharacterized ORF with an associated putative TRS within the M gene (apparently shared among all group III coronaviruses), and previously described ORFs 5a and 5b. The TCoV genome is organized as follows: 5 UTR -replicase (ORFs 1a, 1b) -spike (S) protein -ORF3 (ORFs 3a, 3b) -small envelop (E or 3c) protein -membrane (M) protein -ORF5 (ORFs X, 5a, 5b) -nucleocapsid (N) protein \u22123 UTR -poly(A). TCoV genome structure and sequence was most similar, but distinct from, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). This is the first complete genome sequence for a TCoV and confirms that TCoV belongs to group III coronaviruses.",

First identified in 1951 (Peterson and Hymass, 1951) , TCoV causes high morbidity, some mortality, and poor long-term growth of the affected birds, resulting in significant economic losses in the turkey industry. Outbreaks have been reported in different areas in the USA including Minnesota, North Carolina, and Indiana as well as in Quebec, Canada (Dea et al., 1986) . Turkey coronavirus was subsequently determined to be the causative agent of blue comb disease during an investigation of an outbreak of acute, highly contagious enteritis in a flock of young turkeys (Nagaraja and Pomeroy, 1997) . In addition to turkeys, TCoV can infect a variety of avian hosts including chickens, pheasants, sea gulls, and quail (Deshmukh and Pomeroy, 1974) . Recently, TCoV was incriminated as one of the most important causative agents of poult enteritis and mortality syndrome Teixeira et al., 2007) .",

Two large open reading frames (ORFs) occupy the 5 proximal two thirds of the genome and are involved in polyprotein processing, genome replication, and subgenomic RNA synthesis, and the 3 one third of the genome codes for structural proteins. ORF1 consists of two overlapping ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins by a ribosomal frame-shifting mechanism. ORF1a encodes 2 proteases; papain-like cysteine protease (PLP) and picornavirus 3C-like chymotrypsin protease (3CLP). Both proteases cleave the polyproteins into at least 16 cleavage products (Sawicki et al., 2007) . An intergenic consensus sequence of about seven bases is found immediately upstream of each gene, which plays an important role for subgenomic RNA synthesis (Sawicki et al., 2007) . Most coronaviruses code for four major structural proteins; spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, small envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, in addition to hemagglutinin esterase (HE) glycoprotein in some group II coronaviruses.",

Whole genome sequences were aligned using ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1997) and subsequently optimized by eye using the Geneious software (Version 3.0.6, Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) (Kumar et al., 2004) . Aligned nucleotide sequences were analyzed using PAUP (version 4.0), and maximum likelihood (HKY85 model with transition/transversion ratio of 2) and maximum parsimony (transversion/transition ratio of 2) search criteria were used with branch and bound search strategies (Swofford, 1991) . Bootstrap supports for the resulting trees were determined using 100 replicate heuristic tree searches in both parsimony and likelihood analyses using the same search criteria. For more detailed ingroup analysis of relationships among the group III coronaviruses, amino acid sequences for the spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E, also known as 3c) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein were aligned using ClustalW and subsequently analyzed using maximum parsimony (branch and bound search algorithm) followed by bootstrap analysis using a heuristic search method.

            "text": "A TCoV was isolated from an outbreak in an Ontario turkey farm and designated TCoV-MG10. Subsequently, the full-length genomic sequence of TCoV-MG10 was determined by sequencing of overlapping PCR fragments in both directions. The sequences were assembled into one contiguous sequence to represent the entire viral genome. The sequence of 27,632 nucleotides was obtained, plus the polyadenylation tail at the 3 end. The entire genome has a GC content of 38.3%. The TCoV genome contained two large slightly overlapping ORFs in the 5 two thirds of the genome and multiple additional ORFS in the 3 one third of the genome (Fig. 1) . Both termini were flanked with untranslated regions (UTRs). The TCoV genome was similar overall in its coding capacity and genomic organization to those of other coronaviruses. Eleven ORFs were identified in the genome (Table 2) . Gene 1 was 19,806 nucleotides comprising ORF1a and ORF1b, located between nucleotides 529 and 20,333. This gene contained motifs common in all coronaviruses including ribosomal frameshifting and slippery sequences, as ORF1b is translated in the \u22121 frame. The typical coronavirus structural genes encoding the spike (S), small envelope (E, also known as 3c), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were identified following Gene 1 (Table 2, Fig. 1 ). The TCoV genome had polycistronic genes 3 and 5 interspersed between the S and E genes, and between M and N genes, respectively. In IBV, Gene 3 is believed to be tricistronic consisting of 3a, 3b and 3c, where 3c has been shown to encode the small envelope (E) protein. Gene 5 contained a coding potential for two products, 5a and 5b, of unknown function. A third ORF of 282 nucleotides was located between the M gene and Gene 5a. This gene, designated ORF-X, contained a coding potential for a protein of 94 amino acids that had no structural or sequence homology with any known protein. BLAST searches failed to identify any protein homologs, but identified highly similar nucleotide sequences from other TCoV isolates as well as from numerous IBV isolates. ORF-X had a relatively distant but highly conserved putative transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). In summary, the genome organization for TCoV was determined as follows: 5 UTR-Gene 1 (ORF1a, 1b)- Fig. 1 . Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) MG10 genome organization.

ORF1a was 11,853 nucleotides in size enabling it to code for a protein of 3951 amino acids, and ORF1b was 7992 nucleotides in length for a coding potential of 2664 amino acids. Those two ORFs overlapped by 40 nucleotides. ORF1b did not contain a typical AUG translational initiation codon but instead started with GAA at position 12,342 ( Fig. 2A) . The heptanucleotide slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) was present which is conserved among all coronaviruses (Fig. 2B) , and therefore the ribosomal frame-shifting mechanism seemed to be applicable to TCoV and ORF1b was believed to be translated by the ribosomal frame-shifting mechanism as a fusion with ORF1a to make the polyprotein of 1a/1b. For most coronaviruses, the polyprotein is processed into 16 cleavage products, while the IBV polyprotein is likely cleaved into 15 products (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . As with other coronaviruses, the TCoV polyprotein was also believed to undergo proteolytic processing by viral proteinases. The TCoV replicase protein was similar to that of IBV in its processing patterns. Since the potential cleavage sites were conserved for both viruses (Table 2) , the TCoV polyprotein was assumed to be processed in the similar manner. Two main proteases used by coronaviruses have been identified; PLP (papain-like proteinase) which produces 2 or 3 N-terminal products of the polyprotein and 3CLP (3-C like protease) which produces the central and the C-terminal region of the polyprotein by cleaving 11 sites (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . Similar to SARS-CoV, IBV encodes only one PLP, whereas other coronaviruses code for two PLPs. In the case of IBV, PLP equivalent to PLP2 of other coronaviruses cleaves the polyprotein at the QS dipeptide to produce the N-terminal 100 kD proteins, and TCoV PLP seemed to function in a similar fashion. TCoV 3CLP was mapped in NSP5. Based on the sequence comparisons between TCoV and IBV, the replicase cleavage products and their putative functions were predicted (Fig. 1, Table 2 ).",

            "text": "It has been suggested that NSP1 does not exist in IBV (Ziebuhr et al., 2007) . Due to the high degree of similarity between TCoV and IBV in the N-terminal region of the polyprotein 1a/1b, TCoV also seemed not to contain NSP1. Thus, for TCoV, NSP2 through NSP11 would be produced from ORF1a, while NSP12 through NSP16 would be produced from ORF1b. The N-terminal most cleave product NSP2 was predicted to locate between nucleotide positions 529 and 2549. The sequence analysis for NSP1/2 reveals 44%, 55%, and 90% identity to BCoV, HCoV-229E, and IBV, respectively. PLP1 was suggested to have been lost during the IBV virus evolution (Ziebuhr et al., 2001) , and our sequence data also supports that TCoV contained only PLP2. Therefore, PLP2 would be responsible for cleavage of the N-terminal part of the polyprotein at two sites between NSP2/NSP3 (AG/GK) and NSP3/NSP4 (AG/GI). PLP2 was identified in NSP3. NSP3 was the largest subunit of the replicase cleavage products and was highly conserved among TCoV-MG10 and IBV-Baudette's strain, as both viruses share 89% identity on the nucleotide level. In contrast, 3CLP would cleave 1a/1b polyprotein at 11 sites and generate NSP5 through NSP16 (Table 2 ). The motif for 3CLP was found in NSP5. The 1a/1b polyprotein contained the motifs found in other nidoviruses (Fig. 1, Table 2 ). An earlier study identified a 87 kD (P87) protein encoded in this region (Lim and Liu, 1998) , and the P87 homolog was also found in TCoV-MG10 as a 673 amino acids protein in the same region.",

NSP5 was similar by 52%, 44%, and 92% at the nucleotide sequence level and by 39%, 44%, and 93% at the amino acids level to HCoV-229E, BCoV, and IBV, respectively. This region was believed to play a critical role for ORF1b processing since the deletion of NSP5 in IBV resulted in the unprocessing of 1b protein (Liu et al., 1997) . NSP3, NSP4 and NSP6 were predicted to carry a hydrophobic transmembrane domain which may play an important role in the transcription/replication process as recently discussed for other coronaviruses (Sawicki et al., 2007) . NSP10 was rich in cysteine and histidine and was predicted to contain a metal binding domain as well as NTP binding helicase domain as with other coronaviruses (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) . NSP11 was predicted to be a small peptide of 23 amino acids in length, which is likely the C-terminal most cleavage product of 1a. NSP12 contained the RNAdependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, which would likely be involved in the genome replication and transcription (Liu et al., 1994) . The RdRp motif was highly conserved among all coronaviruses, and TCoV-MG10 also showed a high degree of sequence identity for RdRp by 64%, 62%, 94% at the amino acid level to HCoV-229E, BCoV, IBV, respectively. NSP13 has previously been suggested to play a role for genome replication by unwinding double-strand RNA (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) . NSP14 was assumed to possess the ExonN domain. This domain may be associated with RNA metabolism such as proofreading ability and recombination. Both coronaviruses and toroviruses contain one ExonN motif while roniviruses contain two copies of the ExonN motif (Snijder et al., 2003) . NSP15 contained the motif for NendoU activity. In SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E, NendoU cleaved the double-strand RNA at the uridylate-containing sequence, and this activity was essential for RNA synthesis and progeny virus production (Ivanov et al., 2004; Posthuma et al., 2006) . NSP16 contained a motif for 2 Omethytransferase (MT) in other coronaviruses , and TCoV also contained NSP16 as the most C-terminal cleavage product of 1ab. TCoV ORF1a showed a 46% sequence identity to both BCoV and HCoV-OC43, which are group II coronaviruses, and a 90% identity to IBV-NC, IBV-M41, and IBV-p65 which are group III coronaviruses (Table 3) . TCoV ORF1b was more conserved than ORF1a, as TCoV ORF1b showed a 59% identity to groups I and II coronaviruses, and 93% identity to IBV which is a group III coronavirus.",

The S gene showed only 40% and 44% identities to that of group I and group II coronaviruses, respectively, while the similarity to different strains of IBV was 57% (Table 3 ). The TCoV S gene showed the highest sequence identity to that from other TCoV isolates, TCoV-Gh and TCoV-GI, by 96% for both. The sequence variability was mainly due to the hypervariable and the receptor binding regions in the S protein. The high degree of sequence identity for S among TCoV isolates suggests that TCoV is less heterogenic as with IBV than other coronaviruses (Cavanagh, 2005) . TCoV S was slightly larger than IBV S as TCoV S was 3678 nucleotides, while IBV S was 3453 nucleotides in size. The coronavirus S protein is responsible for receptor binding and virus-host cell membrane fusion. For groups II and III coronaviruses, the S protein is cleaved into two subunits; the N-terminal S1 product and the C-terminal S2 product. TCoV S was also presumed to be cleaved into S1 (542 amino acids) and S2 (684 amino acids) with the putative cleavage site characterized by presence of basic amino acids (Arg-Arg-Ser) between 542 and 543 ( Fig. 1 ) as for IBV S (Cavanagh, 2007) . The receptor-binding domain in S1 is not well-identified for IBV and thus was not possible to predict for TCoV. TCoV S was likely highly glycosylated as it contained 24 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. TCoV S contained three hydrophobic transmembrane domains; two ectodomains and one endo-domain. TCoV Gene 3 was thought to be tricistronic (ORF 3a, 3b, and 3c). The small membrane (E) protein of 99 amino acids was potentially encoded by ORF3c. Both ORF 3b and E genes overlapped by Fig. 3 . Illustration of conservation of the ORF-X amino acid sequence and the putative TRS found upstream of the ORF-X gene among a number of group III coronaviruses. TCoV and IBV share a highly conserved 94 amino acids hypothetical protein, designated as ORF-X. A highly conserved TRS motif (GTCAACAA) for ORF-X is found 288 nt upstream, within the M gene, in all group III coronaviruses. The Beaudette strain of IBV and strains derived from it such as IBV-p65 have a 49 nt deletion in ORF-X but the remaining sequence aligns unequivocally with all other group III coronaviruses when this deletion is taken into account. 1 n/a, no sequence available for this region; 2 single nucleotide (A) from position 446 (AF072911.1) was deleted to maintain reading frame; 3 17 amino acid deletion (51 nucleotides for 17 codons) in these sequences. 16 nucleotides. The TCoV E gene showed a high degree of sequence identity to IBV E by 90%. The E protein was reported to be a viroporin which played a role in the membrane permeability in SARS-CoV and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, another member of nidoviruses (Wilson et al., 2004; Lee and Yoo, 2006) .",

The E protein analysis placed TCoV-MG10 as the sister taxon to the three IBV isolates used in the analysis; however, there was only a single TCoV available for that analysis so no conclusions was drawn regarding the utility of this protein for inferring evolutionary relationships among these group III coronaviruses. Unlike the analyses based on aligned S or N protein amino acid sequences, group II coronaviruses did not form a monophyletic group in the analysis based on aligned E protein sequences; SARS-CoV did not group with the other three group II coronaviruses included in this analysis.",

Coronaviruses are divided into three groups (I, II, and III) based on the genome structure and organization (Holmes and Lai, 1996; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . Group I coronaviruses include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), TGEV, canine coronavirus (CCoV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), HCoV-229E, and a newly identified HCoV-NL63, whereas group II includes murine hepatitis virus (MHV), BCoV, HCoV-OC43, rat sialodacryoadenyleitis virus (SADV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), and equine coronavirus (ECoV). Group III coronaviruses are IBV as well as the newly discovered pheasant coronavirus. Group III coronaviruses are characterized by modification of Gene 3 to a tricistronic structure that codes for genes 3a and 3b as well as the E gene, and the insertion of an additional unique sequence designated Gene 5. The E gene is common in all coronaviruses but is incorporated into the tricistronic Gene 3 located between S and M genes only in the group III coronaviruses as far as is known. In contrast, Gene 5 located between the M and N genes had only been reported previously from IBV. In TCoV-MG10, Gene 5 has two small ORFs (ORF5a and ORF5b) that code for products of 65 and 82 amino acids, respectively; this is identical in length to the Gene 5 products of IBV. The presence of Gene 5 has been suggested as a genetic maker for group III coronaviruses . In vitro work with IBV has demonstrated that Gene 5 is not essential for virus replication in cell culture (Casais et al., 2005) . Whether or not Gene 5 is unnecessary for in vitro replication of TCoV is unknown.",

Our completion of the full genome sequence of a field isolate of a TCoV shows clearly that the TCoV genome structure and sequence are much closer to IBV than any other coronavirus. Like IBV, the genome structure of TCoV-MG10 is: 5 UTR -replicase (ORF1a and ORF1b) -spike (S) protein -ORF3 (ORFs 3a and 3b) -small envelop (E or 3c) protein -membrane (M) protein -ORF-X -ORF5 (ORFs 5a, and 5b) -nucleocapsid (N) protein -3 UTR-poly(A), in order (Fig. 1) . The non-structural protein gene immediately downstream of ORF1b and the further downstream HE gene that are both commonly found in group II coronaviruses were entirely absent in TCoV. Our data did not support the presence of any gene similar to HE and we concluded that TCoV does not contain the HE gene. As is obvious from Table 3 , TCoV-MG10 and other TCoV isolates demonstrate much higher sequence similarity to strains of IBV that they do for any other coronavirus. For example, the N gene of TCoV was only 44% identical to BCoV and HCoV-OC43 but had 92% identity to the N gene of IBV. This apparent discrepancy with previous sequencing results (e.g. Verbeek and Tijssen, 1991) may be explained by several reasons. One possibility is genome recombination between TCoV and BCoV. It is also possible that a cell line commonly used for coronavirus cultivation, HRT-18, may harbor a latent infection with one of the human coronaviruses which was then activated upon infection with another coronavirus. Laboratory contamination of BCoV is also a possibility.",

The S gene is most variable among IBV strains and between IBV and TCoV, perhaps reflecting the role that the S protein has in determining receptor binding in coronaviruses (Cavanagh, 2005) . Despite the relatively large genetic variation in the S gene of various IBV strains, TCoV also showed a relatively higher sequence identity to IBV (up to 57%) while the sequence identity to the S gene of BCoV was only 45%. In contrast to IBV, our limited study indicates that TCoV S is relatively conserved among isolates, suggesting that the TCoV S genes might be less varied than the IBV S genes. IBV and TCoV have distinct clinical presentations in infected hosts. IBV causes respiratory disease in chickens whereas TCoV causes enteric disease in young turkeys. Perhaps the tropisms exhibited by IBV and TCoV reflect the sequence variation of the S glycoprotein and the resulting differences in receptor affinities. The TCoV S gene is larger than that of most IBV isolates. A study is required to understand the functional difference in S for IBV and TCoV, which may have a great impact on the antigenic properties and tissue tropism of both IBV and TCoV as well as the development of control measures against them.",

This ORF is unique to TCoV and IBV, the only Group III coronaviruses for which sequence data in this region of the genome are available. ORF-X was strongly conserved among group III coronaviruses including most IBV strains and all available sequences for turkey coronaviruses in GenBank as well as the TCoV-MG10 isolate. Eight (e.g. Beaudette and p65 strains) of 40 or more IBV sequences for ORF-X have a 49 base deletion in comparison with other IBV strains; all of the strains with this deletion were laboratory-adapted, cell cultured viruses originating with the Beaudette strain of IBV, suggesting that this deletion may be an artifact of cultivation outside of the natural host. The maintenance of this long sequence within a coronavirus genome seems highly unlikely if this was not a functional gene. Finding a highly conserved putative TRS, 288 bp upstream of the initiation codon for ORF-X within the M gene, reinforces the notion that this gene is functional in both IBV and TCoV despite the unusually long distance between the putative TRS and the initiation codon. This region may be a good marker for group III coronaviruses. Further studies are being carried out to further characterize this particular ORF and determine its role, if any, in virus replication. Among coronaviruses, only SARS-CoV contains an ORF immediately upstream of the N gene, which is referred to as Gene 8. Gene 8 plays an important role in the SARS-CoV replication and induction of apoptosis of its host cells (Chen et al., 2007) . The function of the small ORF found in TCoV remains unknown and the lack of any homology with any known protein makes inferring its function difficult.",

This variation within available 3 UTR sequences of TCoVs is the same as for IBV strains. The 3 UTR of IBV strains (Beaudette, KB8523 and CU-T2) are 503-505 nucleotides in length in contrast to 320 nucleotides for IBV strain M41 (Boursnell et al., 1985) . The 3 UTR of TCoV-MG10 was highly conserved with a 94-98% nucleotide identity to most published IBV and TCoV 3 UTR sequences. In contrast, the identity to BCoV was only 45%. Some viruses such as IBV, human astrovirus, and turkey astrovirus were reported to contain a stem loop-like motif (s2m) in the 3 UTR (Jonassen et al., 1998) . This motif appeared to be conserved among those different viruses, suggesting that it might have resulted by RNA recombination between different viruses (Monceyron et al., 1997) . TCoV was found to contain the same motif in the 3 UTR (Fig. 5) . The presence of the s2m motif in the 3 UTR may also suggest that IBV and TCoV share a common ancestor. Interestingly, SARS-CoV, but not other group II coronaviruses, shares the presence of this conserved s2M motif (see Fig. 5 ). Sequence analyses of the 3 UTR from 19 different IBV strains revealed the presence of two distinct regions: Region I was highly variable and located immediately downstream of the N gene while region II was highly conserved and located upstream of the poly(A) tail (Dalton et al., 2001) . Gobel et al. (2007) reported the presence of the octamer motif (5 -GGAAGAGC-3 ) within the 3 UTR hypervariable region that was highly conserved among all coronaviruses. TCoV-MG10 had two copies of the octamer motif in its 3 UTR; the first copy between nucleotides 25,690 and 25,697, and the second copy between nucleotides 27,553 and 27,560. The role of this motif for coronavirus replication is unknown, but (Gobel et al., 2007) suggested that it might play a role in the coronavirus replication cycle.",
