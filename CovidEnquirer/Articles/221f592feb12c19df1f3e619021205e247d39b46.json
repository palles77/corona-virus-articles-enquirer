In the death cases, 47 went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition. All cases died in the end. Among them, 1 patient died of acute coronary syndrome, while the rest died of respiratory failure and multiple organ failure caused by COVID-19. The cases included 64 males and 37 females, with the age range of 24-83 and average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The majority had underlying diseases with hypertension(42.57%), diabetes (22.77%), neurological disease (9.90%), malignant tumor (4.95%), and respiratory disease( 4.95%). The cases with more than two underlying diseases reached 25.74%. In detail, 10 patients had contact history in South China Seafood Market, and 10 patients had close contact history with infections. The blood type distribution was significantly different, with type A (44.44%), type B (29.29%), type AB (8.08%) and type O (18.19% ). The median time from onset to hospital was 11.00 days ( IQR8.00- 13.50 ) . The median time from onset to death was 21.00 days ( IQR17.00-27.5)( Table 1) .",

Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission(83 [82.18%] of 101 patients). With the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased. It also indicated that there was a high proportion of myocardial damage in the early stage.
