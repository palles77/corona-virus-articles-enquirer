The Dormia basket was passed at least twice to look for any stones, or sludge, which was defined as the presence of granular material within the bile without evidence of stones.

The authors' contention that the typical clinical presentation (i.e., patient selection) was key to obtaining clinical improvement and to providing evidence of stone disease-as 69% had evidence of altered bile-seems well founded. The lower (\u03fd5%) incidence of post-ERC pancreatitis seen in this cohort is at variance with previously reported values of up to 30% (9) and is more in keeping with stone disease than a functional (dyskinesia) disturbance. All procedures were performed by expert endoscopists. The sensitivity of ERC in diagnosing biliary pathology (stone disease) in this study is surprisingly low-again, possibly related to patient preselection; also, routine common duct sweeping with a Dormia basket as utilized in this trial is not universally practiced. Unfortunately, the characteristics (clinical/outcome) of each patient were not revealed by the authors.",

Further prospective trials employing biliary manometry before ES and longer follow-up would help in clarifying this issue. with nosocomial diarrhea. The modified rule addresses the two known weaknesses of the strict 3-day rule: immunesuppressed patients and nosocomial outbreaks of bacterial gastroenteritis. In addition, the modified rule addresses a third group of previously unidentified patients at risk of non-Clostridium difficile bacterial nosocomial diarrhea: patients older than 65 with comorbidity. The modified rule would decrease the number of stool cultures by half without missing any clinically significant cases. The authors recommend the modified 3-day rule as a way to \"greatly reduce the laboratory burden of stool culture, yet provide rapid diagnosis for patients at increased risk of nosocomial bacterial gastroenteritis. Multiple risk factors have been linked to ND, including age, length of stay, hospital roommates, and antibiotic use (especially broad spectrum antibiotics and third generation cephalosporins). For infectious ND, the most common etiological agent in the United States is Clostridium difficile (21-52%), followed by salmonellae (3-11.8%). Immune-compromised patients, especially after transplant procedures, and HIV-infected patients can have a variety of pathogens including bacteria (C. difficile, Salmonella, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli), viruses (rotavirus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, coxsackievirus, etc), protozoa (Cryptosporidium and Microsporida), and fungi (Candida) (1) .",

Because they rarely cause ND, very few stool cultures ordered after 72 h of hospitalization are positive (0.6%) relative to community-acquired diarrhea (2.6 -6.4%) (8 -10). The extremely low rate of positive cultures has led to an estimated cumulative cost per positive stool culture of $1300 (9).

They estimated that the cost per positive culture would drop from $1276 to $670 if cultures after the 3rd hospital day were rejected. In the second part of their trial, they instituted an intervention comprised of rejection of all stool cultures ordered past the 3rd hospital day, a circular to the medical staff justifying this rule, and the option for the clinician to contact the on-call fellow to override the rejection for clinical reasons. Their intervention resulted in a decrease of the percentage of stool cultures ordered past the 3rd hospital day from 53% to 30%. Three hundred sixty-eight cultures were rejected under the new rule. Clinical override was granted for 23 specimens, none of which turned out positive. They found stool leukocytes to be unhelpful as a screening test before culturing.",

Using a 10-yr review of all positive stool cultures at their institution, the authors derived the modified 3-day rule that would have allowed stool cultures in all of those cases. In a retrospective sample of 1,025 stool cultures, the modified rule would have prevented 52% of cultures without missing any clinically significant cases (one case of Yersinia enterocolitica biovar 1 without virulence plasmid pYV would have been missed). The modified 3-day rule was then retrospectively tested at three other institutions using 14 yr worth of data amounting to 27,000 stool cultures. The modified rule would have missed two of 65 positive cultures obtained from patients after their 3rd hospital day; neither of them required antibiotic treatment. The unmodified 3-day rule would have missed 52 positive cultures, 28 of which required antibiotic treatment. The modified 3-day rule would also have significantly limited the delay in recognizing two outbreaks of nosocomial bacterial enteritis, a delay that would have occurred with the unmodified 3-day rule.",

This trial can provide these laboratories with the means to fine tune their strategy to minimize the risk to patients' well-being while maintaining significant cost benefits. Laboratories that have not yet implemented strategies to limit wasteful stool cultures for ND can find in this modified rule a relatively safe and effective way to achieve better yields. Even in the absence of laboratory strategies, physicians can use this modified rule to increase their effectiveness in ordering stool cultures and shift their focus to other causes of ND in patients who do not fit these criteria. It is important to reiterate that, in contrast to stool cultures, tests for C. difficile toxin are positive in 20 -25% of cases and should continue to be a routine component of the evaluation of ND.

Multiple etiologies have been linked to ND, including medication intolerance or abuse, antibioticassociated disease, medical procedures, hyperalimentation, diarrhea associated with other medical conditions (diabetic neuropathy, uremia, etc), or acquisition of a nosocomial pathogen (1). The National Nosocomial Infections Study reported an overall rate of ND of 1.3/10,000 hospital discharges (2) from 1980 to 1984. In the 1990s, rates of ND in",

Two hundred patients with chronic GERD referred for laparoscopic fundoplication underwent clinical assessment, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-h pH monitoring. Patients were stratified according to presence or absence of esophageal dysmotility (100 in each group) and randomized to either a 360\u00b0(Nissen) or a 270\u00b0(Toupet) fundoplication. This resulted in 50 patients with normal motility and 50 patients with dysmotility undergoing Nissen fundoplications and Toupet fundoplications, respectively.",
