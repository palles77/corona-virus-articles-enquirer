A control real-time PCR was carried out on albumin DNA to standardise the non-homogenous respiratory samples. No cross-reactivity was observed with viruses or bacteria that could be found in the respiratory tract. The diagnosis rate using the AB PCR on clinical samples was 10.7%: 3.4% for HBoV detection, 6.9% for HAdV detection and 0.3% double detection HBoV-HAdV. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the HAdV-and HBoV-infected patients were evaluated. In the HAdV-positive group and the HBoVpositive group the samples were classified according to the severity of the disease. The HAdV viral load did not appear to be linked to the severity of the disease. Conversely, the difference between the two HBoV groups, severe and non-severe, was significant statistically when the comparison was based on the viral load (P = 0.006) or after adjustment of the viral load to the number of cells in the samples (P = 0.02).",

            "text": "Adenoviruses (HAdV) are common infectious agents that cause sporadic or epidemic respiratory infections (Mitchell et al., 2003) . To date, 51 different HAdV serotypes divided into six species (A to F) have been identified (Benk\u00f6, 1999; De Jong et al., 1999; Xu et al., 2000) . Adenovirus serotypes 1, 2, 5, and 6 from species C, Ad serotypes 3 and 7 from species B1, and Ad serotype 4 from species E are most frequently isolated from patients with respiratory tract diseases (Benk\u00f6, 1999; Vabret et al., 2004) . According to a WHO (World Health Organization) study, \u223c20% of HAdV respiratory infections are caused by HAdV7 (Erdman et al., 2002) . Immunofluorescence assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and viral isolation techniques are used routinely to detect HAdV associated with respiratory infections. However, HAdV can take several days to grow in cell culture, are susceptible to specimen toxicity, and can be out-competed by bacteria or fungi. Diagnosis by virus isolation is not rapid enough, while direct antigen detection by immunofluorescence lacks sensitivity. In contrast, molecular identification by PCR can be both rapid and sensitive. Most PCR assays detect sequences in the hexon gene (Allard et al., 1990; Hierholzer et al., 1993; Morris et al., 1996; Raty et al., 1999) , whereas other PCR assays use sequences in the VA RNA gene (Kidd et al., 1996; Vabret et al., 2004) .",

Because HAdV and HBoV are both DNA viruses which are associated with respiratory infections, it would be convenient to have an assay to detect both viruses in the same DNA sample. Towards this end, a duplex real-time PCR assay was developed and validated for rapid screening of HAdV and HBoV in respiratory samples.",

The mean number of HAdV copies was comparable in the two groups, whether the disease was severe or not (3.06 log versus 3.07 log). The ratio of HAdV copies to albumin DNA copies ranged from 0 to 404.78 with a mean of 62.82 in the patients with severe disease, and from 0 to 103.57 with a mean of 26.52 in the patients with non-severe disease. There was no statistical difference between these two groups. The HBoV copy number ranged from 1 to 7.7 log with a mean of 3.99 log and a SD of 2.95 log in the severe disease group and from 1 to 4.3 log with a mean of 1.75 log and a SD of 1.01 log in the non-severe disease group. The mean number of the HBoV DNA copies was higher in the severe-disease group than in the non-severe disease group (3.99 log versus 1.75 log) and the difference was significant statistically (P = 0.006). The ratio of HBoV copies to albumin DNA copies ranged from 0 to 8012.82 with a mean of 1883.15 in the patients with severe disease, and from 0 to 87.33 with a mean of 6.35 in the patients with non-severe disease.

In the second study, the AB PCR and the conventional PCR were used to test serial dilutions of two DNA samples extracted from positive nasal aspirates. The AB PCR had 10\u00d7 greater sensitivity, i.e. it was able to detect virus in a reaction using 10-fold less DNA than was needed for a positive result using conventional PCR. Thus, differences in results using the AB PCR versus the conventional PCR are likely due to samples with low viral loads.

Nevertheless, factors other than viral replication could play a role in symptom severity, as inflammatory response or genetic susceptibility of the patients. The absence in this assay of an internal control for the PCR inhibitions and extraction efficiency for all negative samples is a limitation of the study. The detection of PCR inhibitor consists in a supplementary PCR assay increasing the costs of the research. Nevertheless, the detection of PCR inhibitors is an important step in routine tests. Other studies on nasal aspiration samples show a very low percentage of inhibitors. The techniques described by Coiras et al. included an internal control supplied with Promega \u00a9 Kit and no amplification inhibitors were detected during clinical evaluation (Coiras et al., 2003 (Coiras et al., , 2004 . Syrmis et al. used an endogenous human retrovirus (ERV-3) as an internal control and found that only 5 out of 396 samples tested were not amplificated (Syrmis et al., 2004) . Dingle et al created a stable internal control based on a modified RNA fragment of hepatitis Delta (Dingle et al., 2004) . Among the 324 respiratory samples tested, only two cases of inhibition were detected. It is possible that the dilution of samples in the transport medium overcomes the effect of inhibitors (Syrmis et al., 2004) .",
