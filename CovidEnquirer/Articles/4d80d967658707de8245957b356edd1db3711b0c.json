Many viruses are reported to resist one or more classes of disinfectants in concentrations and for exposure times expected to be used in animal facilities (29,30,31,32,33). Scott (29) examined the activity of several disinfectants and their combination against three feline viruses (a herpesvirus, a calicivirus, and a parvovirus) and Brown (30) examined the activity of disinfectants against three porcine viruses (a herpesvirus, a parvovirus, and a coronavirus). The parvovirus in both cases was the most resistant while the herpesviruses and the coronavirus were quite susceptible to a broad range of disinfectants. The calicivirus (Picornaviridae) was intermediate in its resistance. The single most effective agent tested was household bleach (sodium hypochlorite 5-6 percent) diluted 1:32 and used alone or in combination with a quaternary ammonium disinfectant for added detergency. Major drawbacks to the use of sodium hypochlorite solutions are its corrosive and potentially toxic nature and its inactivation by organic matter.",

Footnotes (cont'd) 6) Polyomavirus a) Rat and hamster papova viruses have not been well characterized. 7) Parvovirus a) MVM for mice and KRV and H-1 for rat are the only rodent parvovirus antigens used for antibody determination, and partially characterized in their primary host. There are others that have not been investigated as yet\u00b7 In recent years antibodies to parvovirus have been detected in mice and rat sera by IFA and ELISA in absence of HAI antibodies to MVM, KRV and H-1 viruses\u00b7 Parvovirus specificity of these antibodies has been determined but the causative agent is unidentified (personal communication Tattersal and Bhatt)\u00b7 8) Cowpox a) Cowpox virus has been reported once from laboratory rats. The natural history of cowpox virus is not well understood\u00b7 9) LCMV a) The mouse is the primary host for LCMV. Rat, guinea pig and hamster can be infected by exposure\u00b7 Human infections have occurred by exposure to infected wild mice and laboratory and pet hamsters. Infection of neonatal mice usually results in persistant infection while infection of young adults is usually transient. Recent studies indicate that genes of the virus and of the host greatly influence the outcome of infection. and RCV are antigenically and biologically very closely related. Several serotypes reported. Probably represent a group of antigenically related virus strains with biological differences.12) TMEV a) Antibodies to TMEV have been detected in guinea pigs by HAI test. This has not been confirmed by virus isolation or other serological or virological tests.13) Reovirus a) Reovirus 3 can infect rats, guinea pigs and hamsters. Experimental data are not available.",
