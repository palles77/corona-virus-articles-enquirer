The bacterium is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected deer tick, of which there are two types: the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacifi cus), causing disease on the Pacifi c coast, and the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis), causing disease in the northeastern and north-central United States. The reservoirs for these ticks are the whitefooted mouse and deer. Transmission is based on the length of attachment of the tick, with low risk of transmission associated with less than 24 to 48 hours of attachment. Lyme disease is commonly found in the northeastern mid-Atlantic and midwestern portions of the United States, as well as several counties in northwestern California. Outside the United States, the disease can be found in Spain, France, Austria, Germany, Russia, and Japan. Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease may present year-round, with a higher incidence during late spring to summer (May to August).",

The classic rash of Lyme disease is erythema migrans (EM), commonly found on the head or neck in young children or the extremities of older children. The lesion begins as a small red maculae or papule at or adjacent to the site of the bite, which enlarges in an annular centrifugal fashion to approximately 10 to 15 cm in diameter, resembling a \"bull's eye.\" EM is commonly associated with nonspecifi c symptoms such as fever, fatigue, malaise, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias. EM, found in only two thirds of humans bitten by an infected tick, appears typically 14 days after the initial exposure.

Ticks should be removed with either tweezers or fi ngers shielded with rubber gloves, grasping the tick as close to the skin as possible and pulling with steady, even pressure without squeezing or crushing the body of the tick. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment has not traditionally been recommended in the case of an attached tick since the transmission rate is low (<10%), but a recent prospective study found that 200 mg of doxycycline was effective in preventing EM in adults living in hyperendemic areas who had removed an attached deer tick within the prior 72 hours. However, this regimen is unproven in children and has the potential for signifi cant side effects in those less than 8 years of age. Therefore, it cannot be routinely recommended. 6, 7 Ehrlichiosis Human ehrlichiosis is caused by the bite of an infected tick. In the United States, the lone star tick (Amblyonmma americanum), the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis), and the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacifi cus) are known vectors. The four species known to cause disease in humans are Ehrlichia chaffeensis, phagocytophila, equi, and, most recently, ewingii. 8 Erlichiae are small, gram-negative bacteria that invade leukocytes, causing two clinically similar illnesses: human monocytic ehrlichiosis (reported from the southeastern and south-central United States) and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (reported from Wisconsin and Minnesota).

Although rates of ehrlichiosis increase with age, there have been reported cases of severe and fatal infections in children and young adults. The incubation of Ehrlichia is 5 to 10 days after the initial tick bite. Infected humans may be asymptomatic, or may exhibit constitutional symptoms such as fever (>38\u00b0C), headache, malaise, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, photophobia, arthralgias, confusion, and rash. The rash associated with ehrlichiosis occurs in 60% of infected children, and can be described as macular, maculopapular, or petechial, occurring on the face, trunk, and extremities, or rarely (<10%) on the palms or soles. If untreated, ehrlichiosis may progress to more severe illness: meningoencephalitis, seizure, coma, cardiomyopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and renal failure. The mortality rate is 2% to 3%. [8] [9] [10] The diagnosis of human ehrlichiosis can be made on clinical suspicion, but is confi rmed by blood smear (demonstrating the organisms by Giemsa staining or Diff-Quick methods), serologic testing (indirect immunofl uorescence), PCR, or blood culture. Serologic testing may not be useful in the fi rst week as IgM and IgG levels increase during the second week of illness. Laboratory fi ndings associated with ehrlichiosis include leukopenia (60%), thrombocytopenia (70%), elevated liver enzymes (85%), and hyponatremia less than 130 mEq/L (40%). Differential diagnosis of ehrlichiosis includes Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, meningococcal infection, subacute bacterial endocarditis, secondary syphilis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, gonococcemia, and neoplastic disease. [8] [9] [10] MANAGEMENT Antibiotics should not be withheld pending diagnostic studies in children with clinical suspicion for human ehrlichiosis. Doxycycline (4.4 mg/kg per day divided twice a day, maximum daily dose 200 mg) for children ages 8 years or older should be given by either the oral or the intravenous route and continued for at least 3 days after the defervescence of the fever, for a minimum of 5 to 10 days. The use of doxycycline may be considered in children less than 8 years of age in consultation with an infectious disease expert, recognizing the potential for signifi cant side effects. Children who are toxic appearing, have severe constitutional symptoms, or have severe illness (adult respiratory distress syndrome, meningoencephalitis, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coma, cardiomyopathy) should be admitted to the hospital for supportive care. Consultation with pediatric infectious disease and critical care specialists should be considered.",

Prior to laboratory results, history, such as onset and duration of symptoms, frequency and consistency of vomiting and/or diarrhea, presence of abdominal cramping, or systemic symptoms, will provide some clues to the etiology of the illness in the emergency department. Also important is the type of food ingested prior to symptoms, recent travel history, and similar symptoms in close contacts. Physical examination should focus on the state of hydration as well as other potential life-threatening complications, such as neurologic, respiratory, hepatic, and renal failure. Laboratory studies, such as complete blood count, blood culture, or serum electrolyte analysis, may be helpful to determine the extent of systemic involvement. Stool cultures should be reserved for cases of bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, immunocompromised or very young hosts, or toxic-appearing infants and children. Stool analysis for ova and parasites should be considered in cases of prolonged incubation or duration of symptoms. Some infectious causes, such as Yersinia, may mimic appendicitis, and therefore radiologic studies may be required to rule out an acute abdomen.
