We found for the first time that the mature SARS 3CL protease is subject to degradation at 188Arg/189Gln. Replacing Arg with Ile at position 188 rendered the protease resistant to proteolysis. The R188I mutant digested a conserved undecapeptide substrate with a K m of 33.8 lM and k cat of 4753 s \u00c01 . Compared with the value reported for the mature protease containing a C-terminal His-tag, the relative activity of the mutant was nearly 10 6 . Novel peptide-aldehyde derivatives containing a sidechain-protected C-terminal Gln efficiently inhibited the catalytic activity of the R188I mutant. The results indicated for the first time that the tetrapeptide sequence is enough for inhibitory activities of peptidealdehyde derivatives.",

[1] [2] [3] Although the primary SARS epidemic affecting about 8500 patients and leaving 800 dead was eventually controlled, no effective therapy exists for this viral infection. SARS CoV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus featuring the largest viral RNA genome known to date. 4, 5 The genomic RNA produces two large proteins with overlapping sequences, polyproteins 1a ($450 kDa) and 1ab ($750 kDa), which are auto-catalytically cleaved by two or three viral proteases to yield functional polypeptides. 6 The key enzyme in this processing is a 33-kDa protease called 3C-like protease (3CL protease), because its substrate specificity is similar to that of the picornavirus 3C protease. 7, 8 The SARS 3CL protease is a cysteine protease with a chymotrypsin fold, and cleaves precursor proteins at as many as 11 conserved sites involving a conserved Gln at the P1 position and a small amino acid (Ser, Ala, or Gly) at the P1' position with varying efficiency. 9, 10 The 3CL protease exists as a homodimer and each 33-kDa protomer has its own active site containing a Cys-His catalytic dyad (Fig. 1A) . Interactions between the C-terminal domain-III of each protomer play an important role in the formation of this dimer. The N-terminal end of one protomer is also expected to interact with the domain-II of another protomer to fold the dimeric structure. Although some studies reported that the addition of several resi-dues to the C-terminus of mature 3CL protease did not significantly affect its activity, the kinetic properties and specificity of the mature protease have not been well described.",

[11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Several crystal structures of the SARS 3CL protease with or without inhibitors have also been used to evaluate various types of inhibitors for this protease. 8, [18] [19] [20] [21] Most inhibitors contain a functional group such as a chloromethyl ketone, Michael acceptor, or epoxide that can react irreversibly with the active-site cysteine residue. Few studies regarding reversible inhibitors containing an aldehyde group as a functional group have been reported. 22 In the course of our own studies on the SARS 3CL protease and its inhibitors, we found that the mature protease could be further processed into two fragments devoid of catalytic activity. Here, we report on high level of expression in Escherichia coli and the purification of a proteolysis-resistant mutant of the SARS 3CL protease. The kinetic characterization of this mutant revealed remarkable potency compared with the mature 3CL protease containing a C-terminal His-tag. The potency makes it possible to evaluate newly synthesized peptide-aldehyde inhibitors quantitatively by conventional HPLC.",

The corresponding plasmid was introduced into E. coli, and the desired fusion protein of 75-kDa was obtained as a major product of the total cell lysate ( Fig. 2A, lane 1) . The fusion protein was easily purified with a cobalt affinity column to give a single major band on SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2A, lane 2) . The 75-kDa product did not cleave SO1, an undecapeptide substrate (H-Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe-Arg-Lys-NH 2 ) containing the P 1 /P 2 cleavage site of 3CL protease, probably because of an N-terminal fused large protein. After digestion of the fusion protein with enterokinase, the N-terminal 42-kDa fragment containing the MBP was de-tected, but the desired 33-kDa protein corresponding to the mature 3CL protease was hardly detected (Fig. 2A, lane 3) . To confirm whether the 33-kDa protein was produced or not, we then added enterokinase in the presence of a protease substrate; the substrate SO1 was mixed with the fusion protein prior to the addition of the enterokinase. In this reaction mixture, the substrate completely disappeared within 1 h, and expected fragment peptides were clearly identified by MALDI-TOF-MS ( Fig. 2B; Gln-OH) . This result suggests that the mature 3CL protease was temporarily produced by the digestion of the 75-kDa fusion protein by the enterokinase.",

By blotting the 13-kDa protein to a polyvinylidene difluoride(PVDF), the N-terminal sequence of the product was determined to be Gln-Thr-Ala-Gln-Ala, which shows that mature 3CL protease is cleaved at the 188Arg/189Gln site.

The activity of the mutant relative to the mature protease was nearly 10 6 . Addition of a C-terminal His-tag lowered the relative activity to 0.03 owing to a significant decrease in the k cat value. The results suggest that the additional sequences at the N-and C-terminus of mature 3CL protease remarkably affect the catalytic activities even with several additions as expected from the maturation analysis. 24 The relative efficiency for SO3 and SR1 was 0.06 and 0.01, respectively, when compared with the k cat /K m for SO1. The relative efficiency for SO3 vs. SO1 was exactly the same as reported for the mature protease. 9 The relative efficiency for SR1 was nearly the same as that reported for cleavage at the P 5 /P 6 site, another noncanonical cleavage site of mature 3CL protease. 9 This suggests that mature 3CL protease can digest the precursor protein of SARS CoV at the Arg188/Gln189 site as at non-canonical cleavage sites. Thus, we examined the cleavage of mature 3CL protease by the mutant. Incubation of the C-terminal His-tagged mature 3CL protease with the purified 3CL-R188I protease gave the degradation product derived from the 3CL protease (Fig. 2D, lane 4) .

Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million relative to TMS (0 ppm) or CHCl 3 (7.28 ppm for 1 H and 77.0 ppm for 13 C).

The final concentration of the enzyme (10 to 170 nM for the mutant protease) and the digestion time (15 to 90 min) varied because the cleavage activity differed for each substrate. After the reaction, aliquots were analyzed by HPLC. The initial digestion rates were calculated from the decrease in the peak area of each substrate. K m was calculated from the plot of [S]/v vs. [S], where [S] is the concentration of the substrate and t is the initial reaction rate.
