Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) can provide important parallels: one of the risk factors associated with severe disease and/or a fatal outcome is the presence of other infections [1, 2] . Other infections may therefore exacerbate COVID-19. A case study in China identified the presence of other microorganisms in patients with COVID-19 and included specific nucleic acid based detection for six common respiratory virus and the use of culture [3] . No viruses were identified but the study identified Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Aspergillus flavus in a single patient and several cases of fungal infection were diagnosed including Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. The ability to rapidly identify both the primary pathogen and other infections that may be present early in disease may provide opportunities for targeted intervention in patients suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. The advantage of both laboratory [4] and field-based sequencing approaches [5] was illustrated in the West African Ebola virus outbreak in characterising viral infection and also providing an assessment of the contribution of potential co-infections to outcome [6] . Rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 itself provides utility in two main areas. First, specific amplicon-based sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 allows for potential contact tracing, molecular epidemiology and studies of viral evolution. Second, the use of metagenomic approaches like SISPA provides a check on sequence divergence for amplicon-based approaches. This is particularly important for SARS-CoV-2 as the virus could undergo recombination with other human coronaviruses and mutation and this may also affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy.",

For the amplicon-based system, a series of primers were designed such that the SARS-CoV-2 genome could be amplified in appropriately 1000 base paired sequential fragments, with an approximately 200 base pair overlap to allow sequence assembly from the amplicon data (Fig. 1A) . The primers were selected on the basis of conserved regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome based upon an initial deposition of 17 genomes. The rationale to generate short amplicons was also to allow the selection of primer pairs that could amplify longer segments should one set of primers fail on a particular sample. To test whether the primers could generate amplicons, RNA was purified from Vero cells that had been infected with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (MT007544.1 GenBank). This RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis followed by PCR using the conserved primers. This generated 30 amplicons covering the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and these were sequenced using MinION (Fig. 1B) . The amplicon-based approach was then evaluated on nasopharyngeal swabs collected from two patients with COVID-19.",

This had previously been used to identify dengue, chikungunya, influenza and Lassa fever viruses in clinical samples [7] [8] [9] .

One limitation of the metagenomic approach is the limit of detection and in this study, not all of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was sequenced using the SISPA approach. For diagnostic purposes, RT-qPCR generally is more sensitive, provided that the primer binding sites remain conserved in the pathogen being tested.
