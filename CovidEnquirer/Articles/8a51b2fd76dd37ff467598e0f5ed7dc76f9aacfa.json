We thus hypothesized that IFN-g may play a major role in the pathology by triggering immune-mediated alveolar damage. As we assessed or re-assessed some effects of IFN-g on a number of human lung epithelial and fibroblast cell lines, chosen for their wide use in the literature, we found that alveolar epithelial cells were more sensitive to IFN-g, in terms of proliferation inhibition and enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis. While similar effects were obtained on fibroblasts, concentrations of IFN-g 4e8-fold greater were required. In addition, both epithelial and fibroblastic cell lines were able to secrete large quantities of T celltargeting chemokines, similar to the ones detected in SARS patients. Based on the clinical data collected previously, the available literature and our in vitro experimentation, we propose that IFN-g may be responsible for acute lung injury in the late phase of the SARS pathology.",

As IFN-g seems to play a role in SARS, we set out to compare some effects of IFN-g on a number of human lung fibroblast and epithelial cell lines (chosen for their use in numerous publications as models of their primary counterparts) in order to extrapolate how these cell types co-existing in vivo may react to the presence of IFN-g. For that purpose, identical culture conditions were used for all cell lines. We report here that in substance both cell types were affected similarly, i.e. susceptible to Fasmediated apoptosis after IFN-g stimulation, though to different degrees; fibroblastic lines required much larger amounts to become sensitive. These observations led us to hypothesize that specific epithelial sensitivity to IFN-g may be the basis underlying the development of lung injury in the late phase of SARS.",

However, sensitivity varied among cell lines. Indeed, dose-dependent experiments determined that epithelial cell lines were more susceptible to the effect of IFN-g than fibroblast cell lines (data not shown). Two hundred and fifty IU mL \u00ff1 of IFN-g in A549 and BEAS-2B resulted in very significant differences in growth, while 62.5 IU mL \u00ff1 was sufficient to detect some effects. On the contrary, MRC-5 and HFL-1 required high doses of IFN-g: 2000 IU mL \u00ff1 was necessary to observe a significant growth inhibition.",

The only moderate induction of apoptosis by IFN-g, in the range of 8e10% of the cells, as determined by annexin V/PI and active caspase-8 staining (data not shown), was ruled out as the possible explanation. Cell cycle analysis was on the other hand able to show that, not only was IFN-g ultimately able to dose-dependently arrest the cells at the G 0 /G 1 phase ( Fig. 1E and F), it could also first delay their progression through the S phase, as shown by the accumulation of cells in that phase. This latter effect was dose-dependent ( Fig. 1G ). The multiple ability of IFN-g to inhibit the cells from progressing through their cycle probably explains the early growth arrest observed in A549.",

Induction of apoptosis was only significant in A549, at 36 and 60 h after addition, and in MRC-5 at 12 h, but concerned at any time less than 30% of the viable cell population ( Fig. 3B and D). When IFN-g was added to the culture medium, 12 h before the addition of the anti-Fas antibody, a significant enhancement of apoptosis could be observed in all cell types, although at different times and different extents. In BEAS-2B, an enhanced induction of apoptosis was only observable 72 h after addition of IFN-g (Fig. 3A) . Moreover, this induction was to a lesser degree than in A549, and required the addition of a larger amount of anti-Fas antibody. At the concentration 0.1 mg mL \u00ff1 , anti-Fas antibody was unsuccessful at inducing apoptosis, even after IFN-g pre-treatment (data not shown). In A549, IFN-genhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis developed rapidly, as it was already significant by 24 h (Fig. 3B ), and successfully, as it extended to the whole monolayer, causing all cells to be dead by 96 h (data not shown). Fibroblasts were also susceptible to the enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis by IFN-g. Like in BEAS-2B, apoptosis appeared enhanced only 72 h after addition of IFN-g in HFL-1 (Fig. 3C ). However, in MRC-5 significant enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis was readily observed by 24 h, but declined thereafter to become non-existent by 72 h (Fig. 3D) . In this latter cell line, the enhancement of Fas-mediated apoptosis by IFN-g followed accurately the surface Fas expression profile of MRC-5 cells stimulated by IFN-g.

A549 cells pre-treated with IFN-g were thus co-cultured with a lymphocytic T cell line, Jurkat, which had previously been activated in order to increase the expression of surface FasL (data not shown). Stimulation by IFN-g increased the susceptibility of A549 cells to apoptosis induced by contact with Jurkat cells (Fig. 4) . When the ratio of available Jurkat cells to A549 cells was increased 3-fold, however, the number of unstimulated A549 cells undergoing apoptosis did not significantly increase. But it more than doubled when A549 cells had been stimulated by IFN-g, clearly indicating the role of Fas in the mediation of this induction of apoptosis by cell contact, and the important role played by IFN-g in the enhancement of cellular damage.",

One of the hypotheses emerging to explain the severity of the lung inflammation and damage is the development of a ''cytokine storm'', as result of the infection, leading to an unbalanced inflammatory response. Cytokine profiling of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS patients has revealed the presence of large amounts of IFN-g and IFN-g-related cytokine and chemokines in patients' blood, and the absence of Th2-type cytokines [10] . IFN-g is a cytokine secreted mainly, but not only, by activated and cytotoxic T cells, as part of the immune response to eliminate virus-infected cells. Infiltration of immune cells, including lymphocytes, was observed in the lungs of SARS patients [8] . We therefore hypothesized that IFN-g may be a major contributor to the ALI, for it is known to cause cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. We used an array of cell lines to study how IFN-g could be involved in selective epithelial damage and fibrosis.",

This is in some ways in contradiction to previously available publications. Indeed, Tanaka et al. have reported that they found that human lung fibroblasts were resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis, by opposition to epithelial cells that are known to be susceptible to Fas cross-linkage [17e19]. Although we do not know the actual concentration in International Units of bioactive IFN-g used by these authors to treat fibroblasts, it seems that the dose of IFN-g, duration of pre-treatment, timepoint for detection, or a combination of these is responsible for this apparent resistance to apoptosis. In our work, fibroblasts (HFL-1) required an exposure to high concentrations of IFN-g to observe any enhancement of surface Fas expression and Fas-mediated apoptosis. MRC-5, the second fibroblast cell line used here, was also sensitive to IFN-g, although for only a limited period. This could be linked to the phenotypic differences between the two cell lines, MRC-5 possessing some characteristics of myofibroblasts [20] . The possibility that fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts protects them from IFN-g-enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis is currently under investigation in our laboratory.",

A similar, yet more convincing, observation could be made with MRC-5 cells. These cells could express Fas, but anti-Fas antibody alone was not able to provoke a clear increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 3B) . When Fas expression was enhanced by IFN-g, so was apoptosis, by 24 h (Figs. 2I and 3B ). When the Fas expression returned to its basal level by 72 h (Fig. 2K) , so had apoptosis (Fig. 3B) .

In any way, this does not affect the fact that lung epithelial cells are clearly highly sensitive to IFN-g, while fibroblasts are remotely affected. IFN-g has thus the ability to prime the destruction of the lung epithelium; indeed, in addition it stimulates epithelial cells, like neighboring fibroblasts, to release significant amounts of chemokines that are known to attract the migration of immune cells. Infiltrating lymphocytes were observed in autopsied cases of SARS [8] .

MIG, on the other hand, was more readily produced by fibroblasts, although epithelial cells were also sensitive to the IFN-g stimulus. This particularity could be the result of the dual effect of IFN-g on epithelial cells: while it stimulates the expression of proteins, it also inhibits cell growth. The latter effect would undoubtedly downsize any stimulated increase in protein expression. Overall, the data point towards an increased readiness of epithelial cells to respond to IFN-g by the release of chemokines, in comparison to fibroblasts that require larger concentration of the cytokine. Ultimately, the experiments investigating the production of chemokines were designed to determine if IFN-g could further contribute to a lung immunopathology by favoring chemoattraction of the necessary actors (i.e. T cells) for immune-mediated cellular damage. Whilst IFN-g is essentially regarded as an antifibrotic agent, evidence exists to suggest that this cytokine may play an important role in the development of the lung injury that precedes fibrosis [21] . Indeed, the absence of IFN-g resulted in reduced inflammation in various models of lung injury using IFN-g-knockout mice [22e24] . Several studies have also suggested that lymphocytes may play a role in pulmonary injury in rodents. For example, T-cell depletion by anti-CD3 antibody treatment has attenuated pulmonary fibrosis and increased survival in mice treated with bleomycin [25] . A recent publication by Glass et al. indicates that, in mice, the SARS-associated coronavirus successfully replicated and induced an increase in various proinflammatory chemokines, in the lungs, including MIG and IP-10 [26] . However, it failed to stimulate the production of cytokines or the infiltration of leukocytes. In this model, no obvious changes in pulmonary function and little signs of lung injury could be observed. Moreover, the focal necrosis and bronchiolar epithelial damage characterized in SARS-associated coronavirus infected B6 mice were not observed in RAG1 \u00ff/\u00ff mice, which lack T and B lymphocytes. Such observations tend to support the fact that in SARS, cytokines and T cells may be important to the development of ALI.",

Here we show lung epithelial cells to be more responsive to IFN-ginduced damage than fibroblasts. Thus, we propose that the Th1-dominant immune-mediated cell death may actually favor the damage of alveolar epithelial cells over the fibroblast layer, leaving the latter relatively intact. In vivo, this would translate into the destruction of the epithelial parenchyma, a basis for the stimulation of repair mechanisms involving fibroblasts, relatively unaffected by the immune response and available for a proliferative response (Fig. 5) . The association of epithelial destruction and fibrosis has been suggested in other situations, and we are currently investigating the possibility that immune-mediated epithelial destruction may directly stimulate proliferation and/or differentiation of fibroblasts [27, 28] . To conclude, these findings are relevant to the understanding of the roles of IFN-g and the Fas/FasL system in ALI, in which alveolar epithelial damage occurs primarily. We suggest that IFN-g may play an important role in the development of an immune mechanism that will lead to ALI, fibrosis and ARDS in SARS patients.",

They were cultured under standard conditions in the following medium supplemented with 10% heatinactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin solution 100!: DMEM for A549 and BEAS-2B, MEM Eagle-Earle's balanced salt solution with non-essential amino acids for MRC-5 and HFL-1, and RPMI 1640 medium for Jurkat. Adherent cells were passaged at 80e90% confluence using 0.25% (w/v) trypsin/1 mM EDTA, while Jurkat cells were subcultured every 3 days. For experimental purposes, A549, BEAS-2B, HFL-1 and MRC-5 were seeded at 1 ! 10 6 , 1 ! 10 6 , 0.8 ! 10 5 and 2.5 ! 10 5 cells per 60 mm culture dish, respectively, in 3 ml of corresponding growth medium.
