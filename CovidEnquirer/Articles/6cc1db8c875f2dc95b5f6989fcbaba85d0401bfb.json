In Saudi Arabia recent significant hospital outbreaks, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have resulted from lack of, or breakdown in, infection prevention and control procedures. This study was designed to assess attitudes to, and awareness of, infection prevention and control policies and guidelines among healthcare workers of different professions and institution types in Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire was administered to 607 healthcare workers including physicians (n = 133), nurses (n = 162), laboratory staff (n = 233) and other staff (n = 79) in government hospitals, private hospitals and poly clinics. Results were compared using Chi square analysis according to profession type, institution type, age group and nationality (Saudi or non-Saudi) to assess variability. Responses suggested that there are relatively high levels of uncertainty among healthcare workers across a range of infection prevention and control issues, including institution-specific issues, surveillance and reporting standards, and readiness and competence to implement policies and respond to outbreaks. There was evidence to suggest that staff in private hospitals and nurses were more confident than other staff types. Carelessness of healthcare workers was the top-cited factor contributing to causes of outbreaks (65.07% of total group), and hospital infrastructure and design was the top-cited factor contributing to spread of infection in the hospital (54.20%), followed closely by lack and shortage of staff (53.71%) and no infection control training program (51.73%). An electronic surveillance system was considered the most effective by staff (81.22%). We have identified areas of concern among healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia on infection prevention and control which vary between institutions and among different professions. This merits urgent multi-factorial actions to try to ensure outbreaks such as MERS-CoV can be minimized and contained.",

Human MERS-CoV is believed to have originated via cross-over from dromedary camels, but the major outbreaks experienced in the Middle East and Korea have been healthcare facility-associated and linked to a lack of, or breakdown in, infection prevention and control procedures [5, 6, [9] [10] [11] [12] . As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) have identified issues such as overcrowding in emergency department waiting rooms and insufficient attention to basic infection control procedures, such as hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), in hospitals in Saudi Arabia [11] . New infection prevention and control guidelines for MERS-CoV patients were introduced by the Ministry for Health (MOH) in Saudi Arabia, largely based on WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, with modifications based on epidemiological evidence, clinical experience and local circumstances [6, [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

On the question of whether their hospital is prepared for any infection outbreak, there were significant differences of opinion (Question 10; Chi square 26.74; p = 0.000162; Table 2 , Appendix B). In particular, while the majority of nurses (58.64%) thought their hospital was prepared for an outbreak, only 37.60% of physicians agreed. Overall, only 48.76% of total staff thought their hospital was prepared for an outbreak ( Table 2 , Appendix B). On the question of whether the surveillance tool used in their institution is effective to prevent or control infection (Question 11) there was no significant variation (Chi square 9.955; p = 0.1265599; Table 2 , Appendix B), with an overall 'don't know' response level of 22.24%. On the question of whether all staff in their unit were following promptly infection control policies, rules and guidelines (Question 12), there was a high level of pessimism across the groups, with 54.01% of all staff responding negatively ( Table 2 ). There was significant variation between the groups (Chi square 19.583; p = 0.00328437). This was mainly attributable to the substantially lower than expected numbers of physicians responding positively, and the lower than expected 'don't know' responses of nurses and higher than expected 'don't know' responses of physicians on this question ( Table 2 , Appendix B). On the related question of whether all staff can differentiate between different isolation protocols such as droplet or contact (Question 13), again there was significant variation (Chi square 39.826; p = 4.9 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ; Table 2 , Appendix B). This was mainly attributable to the higher than expected number of 'yes' responses and lower number of 'no' responses from nurses and to the opposite trend for physicians ( Table 2 , Appendix B). Additionally, both the lab and 'others' staff had higher than expected levels of 'don't know' responses, while nurses had lower than expected levels.

In terms of whether staff had received some form of training or orientation about infection prevention and control, there was also significant variation (Question 2; Chi square 7.0553; p = 0.029373; Table 3 , Appendix C).

Infection prevention and control policies at both national macropolicy and at institution and departmental micro-policy level must reflect these challenges. In all cases, training of staff and effective communication of specific guidelines, policies and procedures are imperative in ensuring implementation. Responses in our study suggested relatively high levels of uncertainty among HCWs on personnel and institution-specific issues, surveillance and reporting standards, and readiness and competence to implement policies and respond to outbreaks. There was evidence of variability between different HCW professions, institution types, age groups, and between Saudi versus non-Saudi staff. Evidence emerged, for example, that many staff were unaware of availability of information on reportable infections in their own units, did not feel they had sufficient training and were not confident that infection control guidelines and procedures were being implemented by colleagues. Staff in private hospitals expressed more confidence than those in government hospitals on a number of issues. Differences between Saudi and non-Saudi staff may reflect the fact that non-Saudi staff were more likely than Saudi staff to work in private hospitals.",

Most outbreaks have occurred in government hospitals, consistent with the results of our study suggesting greater confidence and preparedness of staff in private hospitals compared to government hospitals. The largest hospital-associated outbreak occurred in a government hospital in Jeddah in 2014, in which illness spread among both hospital patients and HCWs [5, 9, 11, 12] . Other government hospital-based clusters of MERS-CoV cases occurred in Riyadh in 2014 and 2015 [5, 22] . A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation revealed issues such as overcrowding in emergency department waiting rooms, and inconsistent application of basic infection control procedures, such as hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), as factors in MERS-CoV outbreaks in hospitals in Saudi Arabia [11] . In the Jeddah hospital, aggressive improvement in infection control deficiencies resulted in a decline in cases [18] . The MOH introduced new infection prevention and control guidelines for MERS-CoV patients [6, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Many of these guidelines are generally applicable to infection prevention and control for all infectious diseases, with emphasis on standard, contact, droplet and airborne precautions, management of overcrowding, and triaging in the emergency department [6] . The MOH expressed the hope that they would be strictly adhered to by all HCWs and in all healthcare facilities [6] . Despite this, in our study the majority of staff of all professions did not think staff in their unit were following promptly infection control policies, rules and guidelines, or that all staff can differentiate between different isolation protocols such as droplet or contact. Nurses generally tended to have more confidence and be less uncertain than the other professions on these and other questions. While nurses were more likely to be female than male, gender had no impact on responses to any of the questions asked, thus the variation in nurses' responses did not relate to gender. Physicians were notably more pessimistic than other staff on these points. While staff in private hospitals were more likely to think that staff in their unit were following promptly infection control policies, rules and guidelines, nevertheless positive responses were confined to a minority of staff, and there was no significant difference across institution types on whether staff can differentiate between different isolation protocols such as droplet or contact. Effective staff training on these elements appears to be urgently required.",

Despite this, staff also identified lack of an infection control training program as one of the most important factors that contribute to the spread of infection in the hospital. This suggests that the level of staff training is not considered adequate by HCWs to equip them for implementation of infection control and prevention policy and guidelines. Consistent with this, there was a low level of confidence in the preparedness of institutions for any infection outbreak, although staff in private hospitals and nurses in general were more positive. Staff perceive that government hospitals and poly clinics in particular need urgently to address staff training and orientation to ensure effective implementation of MOH guidelines and ensure preparedness for any infection outbreak.",

A combination of advanced and basic infection control measures also reduced transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs in a recent study in a tertiary care institution in Saudi Arabia [17] . However, for effective implementation of MOH-prescribed infection control and prevention measures, consultation of front-line employees is vital, and expectations of both management and employees should be clearly defined, communicated and understood [1, 7] . Understaffing, frequent staff turnover, poor design and infrastructure of facilities and lack of education and training opportunities are factors that can impact on effective infection prevention and control [23] . Consistent with this, in our study staff identified hospital infrastructure and design, lack and shortage of staff and no infection control training program as the top factors contributing to the spread of infection in the hospital. Participants perceived that carelessness of healthcare workers was the main cause of outbreaks. Although this perception may be faulty, the pressures imposed on staff by inadequate nurse/physician to patient ratios, lack of adequate system resources and sub-optimal hospital infrastructure can challenge the ability of staff to consistently and carefully apply infection prevention and control procedures. Furthermore, there was a relatively high level of uncertainty among some staff types, notably physicians and staff in poly clinics, as to existence of infection control policies and guidelines in their unit. This suggests a breakdown in communication of expectations and guidelines. This could contribute to apparent carelessness in application of procedures, as staff are unclear as to what the required procedures are. There was also a strikingly high lack of uncertainty among staff of all HCW professions as to whether their institution had an emerging infectious diseases task force (dealing with outbreaks), and indeed as to whether their institution has ever experienced an outbreak. Uncertainty on these questions was particularly striking among younger staff, suggesting that further training and communication with HCWs in the 18-29 year old age group across all professions would be beneficial.",

There was a strikingly high lack of certainty among staff of all types and across institutions as to whether their hospital was enrolled in the national surveillance system. There was also high uncertainty as to what infections should be reported, with nurses and staff at private hospitals being less uncertain than other staff. Again, younger staff were significantly less certain than staff aged over 45 years old. Lack of certainty on this point may relate to lack of availability of, access to, or awareness of, a list of reportable infectious agents available within units. In either case, this suggests an urgent need to meet staff needs for access to such lists, which would be relatively easily addressed.",

The most commonly used tool-except for in private hospitals-was a paper version, but this was considered least effective by staff. An electronic surveillance system was the least often used-except in private hospitals-but considered the most effective by staff. Imple-mentation of electronic surveillance systems would therefore be a measure that could be implemented more widely in government hospitals and poly clinics to improve staff confidence.",

For example, increased compliance with hand hygiene practices due to a series of interventions over a five year period was associated with reduction in HC-MRSA and device-associated infections in a Saudi hospital [24] . Also, a suite of advanced infection control measures in addition to basic IC measures resulted in no transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs [17] . The results of our study suggest that HCWs in Saudi Arabia are aware of limitations in infection control and prevention implementation, and of exacerbating factors in their institutions. Multiple steps are needed to facilitate staff in implementation of guidelines and policies and to improve awareness and compliance, for example on hand hygiene compliance in ICU units [7] . Thus, as evident from the responses of staff in our study, the approach to infection prevention and control measures should be multi-factorial and include ongoing provision of education and training, prominent reminders and reliable provision of the materials needed to implement the policies and guidelines, as well as the involvement and support of hospital management [7] . Attention should also be paid to differences in emphases that may be required in different vulnerable units or departments, including the emergency department, inpatient areas, the dialysis unit and outpatient areas [18, 23, 25] .",

The questionnaire also did not allow participants to elaborate on elements such as the level or type of training they received or what they would class as 'carelessness' in implementation of infection prevention and control measures.
