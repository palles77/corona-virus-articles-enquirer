PMR is used to treat dizziness, spermatorrhea, sores, and scrofula as well as chronic malaria traditionally in China and Korea. The anti-tumor property of emodin was already reported. However, anti-viral activity of emodin on macrophages are not fully reported. Materials and Methods: Effects of emodin on RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages induced by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, were evaluated. Results: Emodin restored the cell viability in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 at concentrations of up to 50 \u03bcM. Emodin significantly inhibited the production of nitric oxide, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, MIP-2, RANTES, and IP-10 as well as calcium release and mRNA expression of signal transducer and activated transcription 1 (STAT1) in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study shows the inhibitory effect of emodin on poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 via calcium-STAT pathway.",

Infections with virus sometimes provoke unregulated hyper-inflammation such as cytokine storm and the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction caused by viral infection could be harmful to human life (Hu et al., 2014) . 'Cytokine storm' is one of major characteristics caused by the pandemic viral infection and leads to multiple Many RNA viruses make cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during the replication process in the infected cell. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic analog of dsRNA, is regarded as a viral mimic tolllike receptor 3 stimulant (Lee et al., 2011) and poly I:C is used to stimulate macrophages in in vitro assay for evaluating anti-inflammatory activity on viral infections. It is well known that dsRNA could trigger macrophage activation. Molecular patterns of invasive pathogens might be recognized by toll-like receptors on cell membrane or Nod-like receptors inside cytoplasm of immune cells, which activates an inflammatory cascade and results in the massive expression of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide and cytokine.",

For example, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Zika virus infection, and avian influenza are still hazardous to the health of specific regional people, which might attain the world level. Till now, effective and safe drugs for these pandemic diseases have not been reported. It is difficult and expensive to develop a suitable vaccine for a new viral disease in time. Therefore, nontoxic and immuno-modulatory herbal materials attract researcher's attention in these days. The property of herbal medicines noticed by researchers is not the removal of pathogenic virus in human body but modulating immune reaction against viral infection because the antiviral agent sometimes shows a side effect. For example, Yoon et al. reported the anti-inflammatory activity of Scutellaria baicalensis radix water extract (Yoon et al., 2009 ) and Yuk et al. reported the anti-inflammatory activity of Epimedium brevicornum herba water extract (Yuk et al., 2010) .

For example, the strong inflammatory reaction with immune activity in human body is a natural reaction against threats from anything which is infectious or foreign but the hyper-inflammation can be inversely a severe attack to human life itself. In the case of viral infection, such a double-sided character of immune activity is also embarrassing researchers of the bio-science. Immune reactions include inflammatory mediators. Among inflammatory mediators, cytokine is regarded to be one of very important elements in immunity and inflammation; cytokines are known to be small proteins (~20 kDa); as a cell signalling molecule, cytokine plays a role in autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine mechanism of immunomodulation; cytokine are produced not only immune cells Poly I:C, which is an analog of viral dsRNA and regarded as a viral mimic toll-like receptor 3 stimulant, induces macrophages to produce various inflammatory mediators, which might be related with dsRNA-relative macrophage activation (Maggi et al., 2000) . It is well known that dsRNA is produced during viral replication (Maggi et al., 2000) . Additionally, Ioi et al have reported that rotavirus, a kind of dsRNA virus, causes cytokine storm followed by Reye syndrome (Ioi et al., 2006) .

As such, ER stress response is an important pathway of virus-induced inflammation.

Other name of emodin is 3-methyl-1, 6, 8-trihydroxyanthraquinone. Various studies for bioactive potentials of emodin have been reported: Hwang et al. reported anti-tumor, antibacterial, vasorelaxant, and diuretic effects of emodin (Hwang et al., 2013). Wei et al. reported the anti-tumor effect of emodin on human tongue squamous cancer and gastric cancer (Wei et al., 2013). In the addition, Cha et al. reported that emodin induces androgen receptor degradation (Cha et al., 2005). Lim et al. reported the inhibitory effect of emodin on phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction (Lim et al., 2014). Interestingly, Li et al. reported emodin inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 (Li et al., 2005). Xiao et al. also reported emodin potently inhibits LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation and cytokine production in mice (Xiao et al., 2014). However, the inhibitory effect of emodin on viral inflammation in human body is not fully reported. Thus, we investigated effects of emodin on poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 by in vitro assay in this study.",

Infection caused by pathogens (such as bacteria, virus, fungus etc.) is always dangerous to human life. Inflammation with immune activity plays an important role in protecting human body from pathogenic infections including the viral infection. However, the viral infection sometimes provokes the unregulated hyper-inflammation such as 'cytokine storm (hypercytokinemia)' (Sordillo and Helson, 2015). And the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction against viral infection could be harmful to human life (Hu et al., 2014; Pribul et al., 2008). Up to recently, studies on anti-virus vaccines and anti-viral drugs have been emphasized, but the present data shows that the modulation on cytokine productions caused by viral infectious diseases also deserves to be inspected carefully. Interestingly, Hutchinson et al. have reported that chemokines such as (MCP-1, MIPs, RANTES, IP-10, etc.) are increased in Ebola virus-infected primates (Hutchinson et al., 2001).",
