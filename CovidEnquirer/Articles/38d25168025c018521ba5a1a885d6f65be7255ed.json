In addition to simple visualization, many additional tools can be readily applied. Electrophysiologic testing is easily and frequently performed. This is an excellent way to evaluate the retina's ability to react to a light stimulus. Fluorescein angiography, which uses a dye injected into a vein in the arm, allows photographs of the retina to be printed. This approach helps to visualize the vascular system and the integrity of the retina. The severity of the inflammatory response can be graded by direct visualization of the ocular inflammatory response. Most inflammatory processes that we recognize have associated cellular responses. We also know that antibody-mediated pathology, as seen in such entities as cancer-associated retinopathy, can occur but seem to do so in the distinct minority of cases.",

It is known that an antigen placed into the anterior chamber of the eye induces a deviated immune response, with a marked decrease in cell-mediated responses, but intact cytotoxic and B-cell responses are maintained (1) . In addition, the retina is a complicated structure; several layers are needed to turn a light stimulus into a chemical signal that is ultimately sent to the brain. A number of uveitogenic antigens have been identified and characterized at the photoreceptor level and the single layer just below it, that is, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (2) . Two antigens in particular, the retinal S-antigen and the inter-photoreceptor binding protein (IRBP), have been used to develop a model of autoimmune ocular disease, called experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (3) . This model has many qualities of the disease observed in humans, and it has enhanced our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to disease. One major difference between this model and human disease is, of course, that it is not spontaneous. It is not clear what triggers the human disease. This chapter explores one such trigger-ocular infection. Several entities, some based on animal models, others seen in the clinic, are discussed to elucidate the possible role between infection and autoimmunity.",

The virus causes an acute infection marked by virus replication in distinct retinal cells, and the production of both neutralizing antibody and cytokines. This disease also has a genetic component. Different strains of mice, such as BABL/c and CD-1, were extensively studied after coronavirus infection. During the early phase of the disease (days 1-8) the virus infects and replicates within the retina of both BALB/c and CD-1 mouse strains. 11 However, only the BALB/c mice experience a late phase of the disease (days 10-140) that is marked by a retinal degeneration. CD-1 mice do not undergo the retinal degenerative phase; rather, the retina returns to a normal architecture within 20 days.",

Either of these strains is responsible for approximately 50% of the incidence of the common cold. A new human coronavirus was discovered as the causative agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 12 One of the closest relatives to the human SARScoronavirus is the murine coronavirus MHV. The JHM strain of MHV is the most thoroughly studied neurotrophic coronavirus. It causes both acute and chronic central nervous system (CNS) effects in mice and rats.

The presence of IFN-g also was associated with an up-regulation of MHC class I and II molecules on a variety of retinal cells. In contrast, MHC class I and II molecules were not identified within the normal or mock-injected retinas. It was noted that the first cell to express these MHC molecules was the RPE cell. This cell is also the first cell to express new viral antigens during infection in vivo and is persistently infected in vitro. 18 It is critically important to point out that this RPE cell has been shown to process and present retinal and non-retinal antigens to sensitized T cells, and it is up-regulated to express MHC class II molecules during retinal autoimmune and degenerative processes. 19,20",

These studies identified a distinct difference in the early innate immune response between the susceptible and resistant mouse strains. 21 These differences are noted in the production of IFN-g and the two chemokines triggered by IFN-g: CXCL9 and CXCL10. For example, on day 2 and 3 PI, the BALB/c mice have high levels of IFN-g, CXCL9 and CXCL10 in their sera. At the same time, significantly lower levels of these molecules are detected in the sera from CD-1 mice. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis of retinas confirmed that CXCL9 and CXCL10 gene expression is significantly greater in the BALB/c mice retinas compared with CD-1 mice retinas. CXCL9 and CXCL10 interact with CXCR3, which is present on activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and they direct the migration of these cells to specific targets, such as the retina. 22 These studies underscore an important concept: that innate immunity directs and sets the stage for adaptive immunity.

The presence of antibodies to retinal tissue was evaluated by immunoperoxidase staining of frozen sections of normal rat eyes. Two patterns of staining were observed in the BALB/c mice: reactivity in the neural retinal and reactivity in the RPE. The anti-retinal autoantibodies first appeared as IgM class antibodies. This was later replaced by IgG class autoantibodies. The anti-RPE cell autoantibodies were predominantly of the IgG class. Therefore, those mice that failed to develop anti-retinal autoantibodies also failed to develop retinal degeneration (Table 2) . These findings suggest a role for autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of ECOR.",

Using a mouse RPE cDNA library, we identified two retinal autoantigens, a-fodrin and villin 2, in ECOR. a-Fodrin is found in the cytoplasm of cell bodies in inner nuclear layer (INL) and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and on the apical surface of the RPE. Villin-2 is found in both RPE cells and M\u00fcller cells. A truncated form of a-fodrin was expressed and purified. This purified a-fodrin reacted only with sera from virus-infected BALB/c mice. Moreover, CD4 T cells from virus-infected BALB/c mice specifically responded to a-fodrin peptide. These data suggest that both antibodies to a-fodrin and CD4 T cells specifically sensitized to a-fodrin may contribute to the retinal degeneration seen in the ECOR susceptible mice. It is of interest to note that autoantibodies to a-fodrin have been observed in three human diseases: glaucoma, Alzheimer's disease, and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. ",

            "text": "Toxoplasmosis is a disorder that has a worldwide distribution. It is caused by the obligate intracellular parasite T. gondii. Over 500 million people are believed to have the disease. The organism was first described in the brain of gondii, a North African rodent, by Nicolle and Manceaux 24 in 1908 and in a rabbit by Splendore. 25 The first connection between this organism and human disease was made by Janku, 26 who described the presence of the organism in a child who died of disseminated toxoplasmosis. While suspected for a long period, it was not until the early 1950s that the parasite was shown to cause ocular disease. Helenor Campbell Wilder, working at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington, DC, identified the organism in eyes that were believed to have other types of inflammatory processes, particularly tuberculosis. 27 It is interesting to note that a similar observation has been made more recently in Nepal, where many cases of ocular tuberculosis have been re-diagnosed as toxoplasmosis of the eye. The cat (and perhaps related species) seems to be the definitive host of T. gondii. The sexual cycle is one of schizogony and gametogony, leading to the development of toxoplasma oocysts, which are 10-12 mm in size and are found uniquely in the intestinal mucosa of cats. Two forms of organisms can be found in man: cysts and tachyzoites. The tachyzoites (the proliferative intracellular form) are believed to be the cause of most tissue damage in humans, although often it is very difficult to demonstrate the presence of this stage of the organism. The bradyzoites (the latent form of the organism found in cysts) are found in host cells. Hundreds of bradyzoites (with very slow metabolic rates) have a propensity towards neural tissue, such as the eye and brain, but also are found in skeletal muscle and heart. It is assumed that attacks occur with rupture of the cysts, leading to a release of bradyzoites and then the conversion of the brayzoites to tachyzoites. The mechanisms that lead to cyst rupture are still unknown.",

In addition to the retinal S-antigen, we also evaluated the response to crude Toxoplasma antigen and to purified antigens from the parasite. 31 We also used EIA to look for anti-S-antigen antibodies and investigated HLA phenotyping to determine whether a specific HLA type was associated with S-antigen responsiveness. Of the 40 patient's lymphocytes tested, 16 (40%) had proliferative responses with a stimulation index above 2.5 ( Figure 1 ). There seemed to be no correlation with this responsiveness and any HLA phenotype. In addition, we were unable to demonstrate anti-S-antigen antibodies using EIA.

They found that patients with mild disease responded to one or more retinal antigens with a significantly higher frequency than patients without disease or with severe disease. Based on these findings, they suggested that the presence of cellular immune response towards retinal autoantigens is not protective against the development of ocular lesions induced by T. gondii, but it may protect against the development of severe disease. Autoimmune responses may protect the neural retina against the damage caused by infection with T. gondii.

Using an immunofluorescent assay of human retina tissue, they observed reactivity in the inner retina and photoreceptor layers. During the 1990s, researchers performed a number of studies to elucidate the nature of autoimmune reactivity. [36] [37] [38] [39] They identified a recombinant antigen in O. volvulus that showed immunologic cross-reactivity with a component of the RPE. 36, 37 Using Western blot analysis, an antibody to a 22,000-molecular weight antigen (OV39) of O. volvulus recognized a 44,000-molecular weight component of the RPE cell. Subsequent studies showed that hr44 antigen is present in the optic nerve, epithelial layers of iris, ciliary body, and RPE. Although OV39 and the hr44 proteins are not homologous, they did show limited amino acid sequence identity. 40 Immunization of Lewis rats with either OV39 from O. volvulus of hr44 from human retinal tissue induced ocular pathology. 39 Retinal disease in the rat was characterized by extensive breakdown of the posterior blood-ocular barrier, iridocyclitis and retinitis and the activation of retinal microglia. These studies indicate that molecular mimicry between O. volvulus and human RPE protein may contribute to the retinopathy found in patients with onchocerciasis.",

The most common therapy for all of these conditions is immunosuppression, and therapy is directed against what is believed to be an autoimmune, or least non-infectious, process in the back of the eye.",

            "text": "We have reviewed the evidence implicating three distinct classes of infectious agents in the development of an autoimmune process within the retina. These data also indicate that distinct pathogenic mechanisms are involved in the induction of autoimmunity triggered by these three organisms. In T. gondii infections, the persistence and chronic reactivation of the organism is probably responsible for the introduction and presentation of sequestered retinal epitopes to the immune system. In O. volvulus infections, molecular mimicry between the organism and human RPE protein may contribute to the retinal pathology. In ECOR, similar processes are induced in coronavirus-infected mice displaying either susceptibility or resistance to retinal degeneration. However, recent evidence indicates that differences in time of induction, duration, and intensity of innate immune reactivity may contribute to autoimmune reactivity in BALB/c mice.",
