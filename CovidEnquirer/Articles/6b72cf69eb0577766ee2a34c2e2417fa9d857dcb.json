            "text": "Development of effective vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is still a priority in prevention of re-emergence of SARS. Our previous studies have shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein elicits highly potent neutralizing antibody responses in the immunized animals. But it is unknown whether RBD can also induce protective immunity in an animal model, a key aspect for vaccine development. In this study, BALB/c mice were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 10 g of RBD-Fc (RBD fused with human IgG1 Fc) and boosted twice at 3-week intervals and one more time at 12th month. Humoral immune responses of vaccinated mice were investigated for up to 12 months at a 1-month interval and the neutralizing titers of produced antibodies were reported at months 0, 3, 6 and 12 post-vaccination. Mice were challenged with the homologous strain of SARS-CoV 5 days after the last boost, and sacrificed 5 days after the challenge. Mouse lung tissues were collected for detection of viral load, virus replication and histopathological effects. Our results showed that RBD-Fc vaccination induced high titer of S-specific antibodies with long-term and potent SARS-CoV neutralizing activity. Four of five vaccinated mice were protected from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge because no significant virus replication, and no obvious histopathological changes were found in the lung tissues of the vaccinated mice challenged with SARS-CoV. Only one vaccinated mouse had mild alveolar damage in the lung tissues. In contrast, high copies of SARS-CoV RNA and virus replication were detected, and pathological changes were observed in the lung tissues of the control mice. In conclusion, our findings suggest that RBD, which can induce protective antibodies to SARS-CoV, may be further developed as a safe and effective SARS subunit vaccine.",

Although SARS has been successfully contained, re-emergence of SARS-CoV from animal reservoirs is still a potential risk for future epidemic, which is supported by continual reports of finding SARS-CoV-like coronavirus in small animals, such as civets, raccoon dogs [1] [2] [3] and bats [4, 5] . SARS outbreak may also recur in the future by the virus escaping from laboratory accidents [6, 7] .

However, it may also elicit antibodies that enhance virus infection [25, 29] or cause liver damage in animals challenged with SARS-CoV [23] . In this regard, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fragment of the S protein, which has been demonstrated to be a major neutralization determinant, has implied to be an ideal candidate for development of subunit vaccines against SARS [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .

Virus RNA copies in the lung tissues were determined by Q-RT-PCR and described as RNA copies/g of tissues. As shown in Table 1 , viral RNA copies for both the RBD-Fc group and the control group were negatively correlated with the titer of the neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV. The higher titer of the neutralizing antibodies was detected in the sera, the lower copy number of viral RNA was found in the lung tissues. M1 mouse in the RBD-Fc vaccination group developed the lowest titer of neutralizing antibody (1:57) and showed detectable viral RNA copies (3.13 \u00d7 10 3 ), while no viral RNA was detectable in lung tissues of the other four mice in this group as they presented higher titers of the neutralizing antibody (>1:189). Similarly, no neutralizing antibody response in the PBS control group was correlated to the higher levels of RNA copies in the lung tissues (1.39 \u00d7 10 5 to 3.77 \u00d7 10 7 ). These results suggested that the neutralizing antibodies induced by RBD-Fc vaccination play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV infection in virus challenged mice.",

This has raised concerns about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines containing or encoding the full-length S protein. We thus proposed to use RBD, a fragment of S protein, rather than the full-length S protein, for development of a safe and effective SARS subunit vaccine since it contains the major neutralizing epitopes [31, 32, 41] . Our previous studies have shown that the recombinant RBD can induce high potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV and its variants Only M1 mouse exhibited mild histopathological damages in lung tissues. But compared to the control mice, M1 mouse revealed a little damage such as thickened alveolar walls with interstitial mononuclear cells and lymphocytes infiltrates, and with congestion but no markedly hemorrhage or effusion in the alveolar spaces of lung tissues. [31, 34] , but we do not know whether the RBD-based vaccine can protect animals from SARS-CoV infection.",

We found that RBD-Fc elicited potent and longterm humoral immune responses in vaccinated mice. High titers of SARS-CoV S-specific ELISA antibodies and virus neutralizing antibodies were maintained for at least 6 months. Although the antibodies dropped to a low level at the end of the 12th month, their titers rebound rapidly after the mice were re-boosted with RBD-Fc. These vaccinated mice were protected from SARS-CoV challenge since no significant virus replication was detected in their lungs. Notably, presence of high titers of the neutralizing antibody was a prerequisite for protective immunity. Higher titer of neutralizing antibodies was associated with lower level of RNA copies/virus replication and stronger protective activity against SARS-CoV challenge. Among five mice vaccinated with RBD-Fc, four mice possessing high titer of neutralizing antibodies exhibited no significant virus replication and histopathological changes in their lungs while only one mouse with low sera neutralizing antibody titer showed marginal level of virus RNA copies, and mild histopathological changes. However, all of the five mice with undetectable neutralizing antibody in the control group presented high level of RNA copies/virus replication, and obvious histopathological changes in their lungs. Our results indicated that the neutralizing antibody produced in RBD-Fc vaccinated mice plays a significant role in protection of mice from the virus challenge without causing immunopathological damages.",
