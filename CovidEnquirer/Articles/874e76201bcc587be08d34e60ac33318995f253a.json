LEUTENEGGER T he ready availability of a correct etiologic diagnosis, particularly in the setting of contagious infections, enables the veterinarian to make early decisions regarding patient care and management, address appropriate treatment, and effect timely notification and discussion of management issues pertaining to the prevention of disease spread. The past two decades have seen a revolution in the understanding, management, diagnosis, control, and prevention of infectious diseases. This period has encompassed the discovery of emerging equine agents, antimicrobials, and vaccines as well as a wealth of improved diagnostic tests and molecular testing methods for equine practitioners. Despite these advances, infectious diseases remain a leading cause of equine morbidity and mortality, with resurgence of certain infections, an increasing population of elderly and more susceptible horses, and an increasing level of international equine commerce expanding the geographic distribution of pathogens. The focus of rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases also has shifted during this time. The most obvious change has been the appearance and increasing importance of nucleic acid (NA) amplification-based techniques, primarily polymerase chain reaction (PCR), at the expense of traditional methods of clinical microbiology. Polymerase chain reaction has become an increasingly important tool in microbial diagnosis in recent years because of its rapidity, affordability, high sensitivity, and high specificity. These characteristics have propelled the field of PCR-based molecular diagnostics into the arena of applied diagnostics for infectious agents. Because the number of published and offered PCR assays is steadily rising, there is a need for critical evaluation, comparison of performance, and eventually also standardization of methods to enable equine practitioners to select the optimal methodology.",

However, the lack of a market dominator for molecular diagnostics and the relatively fragmented market leads to confusion. This confusion is mostly based on a lack of directed education within the veterinary community. Most veterinarians rely on continuing education offered at local or national meetings to improve their knowledge base of molecular diagnostics. As more and more practitioners use PCR to diagnose infectious diseases, an understanding of the involved processes is important. Further, the indications for using PCR and interpretation of results are often confusing and warrant more education within the veterinary community. The differences among laboratories in protocols used add to the confusion caused by the lack of an acceptable standard.",

This development is a noteworthy driver for molecular diagnostics because it allows acquisition of more meaningful data from a single sample. This so-called panel strategy enables efficient workup of complex clinical syndromes with general or nonspecific clinical signs. These clinical situations do not allow for easy diagnostic decision making by the veterinarian because multiple infectious agents can be responsible for a given clinical picture. Even though veterinarians tend to make a single-pathogen diagnosis, it has become more evident in recent years that many syndromes are caused by coinfections. Panel testing on a large scale will uncover unknown dual or triple infections in animals, which can diffuse the clinical picture. It has long been speculated that seemingly clinically irrelevant equine herpesvirus type 2 (EHV-2) infections in horses may actually aggravate and diffuse the clinical picture presented by secondary infections. More characteristic examples are known from companion animal respiratory infections, which are often initiated by a subclinical virus infection that leads the way to secondary infections.",

            "text": "In general, molecular diagnostic laboratories provide precise recommendations for sample collection and shipping. These instructions pertain to specimen type, volume, anticoagulant, transport specifications, storage, and handling. The sample type or types needed are largely influenced by the pathogenesis of the disease and play a key role in the performance and interpretation of the test results. Veterinarians are advised to adhere to these recommendations because the quality of the result is directly correlated to quality of the sample and preservation of the nucleic acid content. Whole blood samples are collected aseptically into evacuated blood tubes containing EDTA; body fluids (e.g., thoracic, abdominal, joint, cerebrospinal, tracheal wash, bronchoalveolar, and guttural pouch lavage fluid) and tissues should be collected into serum tubes without additives; nasal or nasopharyngeal secretions should be collected with rayon-or Dacron-tipped swabs and are best kept in a serum or conical tube; fecal material should be collected into small fecal cups or serum tubes. All samples must be sent cooled on blue ice by express PCR in Infectious Disease Diagnosis and Management mail overnight to the laboratory. Freezing of samples should be avoided because of the detrimental effects of the thawing process on NA. Short-term storage for a period of 2 to 3 days before shipment (such as would be necessary over a weekend) should be done in a refrigerated compartment. Each sample should be properly labeled and accompanied by a submission form containing information on the animal, owner, veterinarian, sample, and suspected pathogens. Most submission forms can be downloaded from the respective laboratory's website. The laboratory should be notified in advance, and inquiry should be made about the availability of the offered tests as well as the expected turnaround time and the associated costs. Incoming samples normally are processed the same day, and PCR results usually are available within 24 to 72 hours (including shipping) if the purified NA passes the internal sample quality controls (confirming proper collection, storage, shipping, and NA extraction) and other associated quality controls, such as PCR-positive and PCR-negative controls, internal positive control (to confirm absence of PCR inhibitors), and negative extraction control (to confirm absence of cross-contamination during the NA extraction process).

            "text": "Despite intensive investigative efforts, veterinarians frequently diagnose clinical infectious respiratory tract diseases without identifying a primary etiologic agent. A recent voluntary surveillance study on 761 equids in the United States with clinical signs of acute-onset respiratory tract infection determined that 26.4% of index cases had positive PCR results for one or more of four selected common respiratory pathogens (EHV-1, EHV-4, equine influenza virus [EIV] , and Streptococcus equi subsp equi). The highest detection rate was for EHV-4, followed by EIV, S equi equi, and EHV-1. The absence of etiologic diagnosis for some infectious respiratory tract disease cases observed in this and other studies is at least partially attributable to concentrating diagnostic efforts on identifying infection with agents that most frequently cause disease. It is likely that more comprehensive diagnostic efforts would identify agents in affected animals that tend to cause either less dramatic outbreaks or sporadic rather than epidemic disease (e.g., \u03b3-herpesviruses and equine rhinitis viruses). nasopharyngeal swab, which should be collected early in the febrile phase of the disease. Because of the lymphotropism of EHV-1, detection can also be attempted from whole blood. The PCR assays used in the diagnostic field are based on detection of viral genomic DNA and are therefore unable to distinguish between lytic, dead, or latent virus. Alternative molecular approaches have recently been established using quantitative real-time PCR to allow discrimination between the different viral states in horses naturally infected with EHV. Discrimination between the different viral states is now possible by (1) targeting several genes (e.g., glycoprotein, latency-associated transcripts), (2) detecting viral genomic DNA and transcriptional activity of the target genes at the messenger RNA level, and (3) using absolute virus quantification. Quantitative thresholds are used in selected human infectious diseases (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and herpes simplex virus) to determine disease stage and response to antiviral therapy. A similar concept is used diagnostically for EHV-1-or EHV-4-infected horses to discriminate between lytic and nonreplicating viruses, to determine their infectious risk based on viral load in nasal secretions, and to monitor their response to treatment.",

Culture of nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal or guttural pouch washes, or exudate aspirated from an abscess remains the gold standard for detection of S equi equi. Culture, however, may be unsuccessful during the incubation and early clinical phase of infection. Further, the presence of other \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci, especially S equi subsp zooepidemicus, may complicate interpretation of the culture. Available PCR assays are designed to detect the DNA sequence of the S equi M protein (SeM) gene, which codes for the organism's antiphagocytic M protein. This gene offers sufficient nucleotide variability between the two S equi subspecies to allow full discrimination in clinical specimens. One of the pitfalls of PCR has been its inability to distinguish between viable and nonviable organisms; therefore positive results have been considered presumptive in the past until confirmed by culture. At present, the question of viability can be addressed by quantitation of the SeM gene or detection of transcriptional activity of the SeM gene at the RNA level. In several studies, PCR proved to be as much as three times as sensitive as culture. Use of PCR accompanying culture on a nasal swab or guttural pouch lavage sample may be advantageous in a control program to select possible carrier animals because PCR is capable of detecting S equi DNA in guttural pouch fluid for weeks after the disappearance of live organisms. Such is not the case for the nasopharynx, in which the efficient mucociliary apparatus removes organisms and DNA at the same time. Use of PCR should be considered to detect asymptomatic carriers, to establish the S equi infection status of asymptomatic horses, and to determine the success of elimination of S equi from the guttural pouch. Unfortunately, diagnostic PCR assays are unable to differentiate between wild-type and the nonencapsulated, avirulent vaccine strains of S equi. 1 However, when necessary for forensic reasons, differentiation can be undertaken on the basis of morphology of colonies, biochemical analysis, genotyping, and restriction digest. Together, these assays allow differentiation between wildtype and vaccine or ancestor strains.",

The use of novel virulence target genes for the molecular detection of Salmonella has considerably improved the performance and accuracy of such assays. More and more veterinary hospitals in North America are switching from conventional microbiologic culture to PCR for Salmonella testing as part of the infectious disease control program. In such instances, PCR is performed on fecal and environmental samples following a 24-hour selective enrichment step.

Research groups have recently identified regions of variation in the genome of different EHV-1 strains (neuropathogenic vs. nonneuropathogenic). A single nucleotide polymorphism at position 2254 of the DNA polymerase gene (ORF 30) has been associated with a higher risk for EHM development. Rapid PCR assays have been established to allow differentiation between neuropathogenic and nonneuropathogenic strains. However, such assays have moderate specificity because 74% to 87% of EHV-1 strains associated with EHM are of the neuropathogenic genotype.

Diagnosis is often based on awareness of the geographic area for infection, typical clinical signs, abnormal laboratory findings, and identifying characteristic pathogen inclusions in the cytoplasm of neutrophils and eosinophils in a peripheral blood smear. Polymerase chain reaction has been used for many years to study aspects of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of equine granulocytic anaplasmosis. For clinical purposes, the material of choice is whole blood; PCR is a very sensitive and specific tool, supporting the diagnosis especially during the early and late stages of the disease, when the number of organisms is too small to be detected by microscopy.",
