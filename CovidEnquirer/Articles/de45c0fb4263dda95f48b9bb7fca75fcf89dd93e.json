However, the direct effects of membrane lipids on viral replicases are still poorly understood. Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV) protein A, which associates with mitochondrial membranes, is the sole replicase required for RNA replication. Here, we report that WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane lipids (MMLs) stimulated the RNA binding activity and cooperativity of protein A, and such stimulations exhibited strong selectivity for distinct phospholipids. Interestingly, MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding cooperativity only at higher protein A concentrations. Further investigation showed that MMLs stimulate the RNA binding of protein A by promoting its self-interaction. Finally, manipulating MML metabolism affected the protein A-induced RNA1 recruitment in cells. Together, our findings reveal the direct effects of membrane lipids on the RNA binding activity of a nodaviral replicase.",

Different viruses form their vRCs on diverse intracellular organelle membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum (Diaz et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2001; Mas and Beachy, 1999; Pedersen et al., 1999; Schlegel et al., 1996; Schmidt-Mende et al., 2001) , Golgi apparatus (Schlegel et al., 1996) , lysosomes (Froshauer et al., 1988; Kujala et al., 2001; Magliano et al., 1998; Schlegel et al., 1996) , endosomes (Froshauer et al., 1988; Kujala et al., 2001) , peroxisomes (Jonczyk et al., 2007; White and Nagy, 2004) and mitochondria (Miller and Ahlquist, 2002; Miller et al., 2001) . Lipids are major components of intracellular membranes, as they control membrane fluidity and plasticity (Nohturfft and Zhang, 2009; van Meer et al., 2008) , and membrane lipids facilitate the RNA replication of (\u00fe)RNA viruses (Miller and Krijnse-Locker, 2008) . For instance, the complete activity of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) NSP1 protein, an mRNA capping enzyme, requires association with specific negative phospholipids (Ahola et al., 1999) . Sphingomyelin has been found to activate the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b (Weng et al., 2010) . The precise functions of intracellular membranes, particularly membrane lipids, in the RNA replication of (\u00fe)RNA viruses have not been fully understood, but possibly include offering an optimal microenvironment for viral replicase enzymatic activities, facilitating the use of membrane-associated host cofactors and/or directly interacting with viral replicases to mediate their functions (Chukkapalli et al., 2012; Heaton and Randall, 2011) .",

To this end, we first examined whether WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 and RNA2 in vitro, and then explored the direct effects of MMLs on the RNA binding of protein A. We found that WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner, and the cooperativity could be stimulated by high protein A concentrations. MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding activity of protein A, and this stimulation exhibited strong selectivity for different phospholipids. Interestingly, MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding cooperativity only at higher but not at lower protein A concentrations. Further investigation showed that MMLs stimulate the RNA binding activity of protein A by promoting its self-interaction. Finally, we further confirmed that the MML composition changes by manipulating phospholipid metabolism affect protein A-induced RNA1 recruitment in cells.",

To examine whether these sequences are responsible for WhNV RNA1 recruitment/stabilization in cells, we constructed two RNA1 derivates and examined their recruitment in the presence of WhNV replication-incompetent protein A GAA (Fig. 1A) . The plasmid pAC1E, in which an (enhanced green fluorescent protein) EGFP open reading frame (ORF) is inserted at the 3 0 end of RNA1 sequence , is a functional template for RNA1 replication (the transcribed and replicated products are labeled as \"RNA1E\"), but the ORF of protein A is closed by the mutation of the start codon . WhNV Protein A GAA is provided by the plasmid pA GAA . The RdRp activity of Protein A GAA is nulled by mutating the GDD replication site to GAA as previously described Wang et al., 2013) .

To this end, we conducted RNA binding experiments under the conditions described in Fig. 2E except the addition of 2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl MMLs to the reaction mixtures and increasing the amount of RNA probe to 0.2 \u03bcM, because the activity of protein A binding to RNA is significantly stimulated in the presence of MMLs. Because the changes of the migration of protein-RNA complex with the addition of MMLs were not significant in 1.0% agarose gel (Fig. 2E) , we used 2.0% agarose gel to separate the samples in this assay. As shown in Fig. 3C , increasing the amount of MMLs resulted in a rapid transition of the RNA probe to bound form and obvious changes of the migration of protein-RNA complex at the high protein concentrations. The RNA binding data was applied to Hill transformation (Fig. 3D ) and compared to that in the absence of MMLs (Fig. 2G ). Very interestingly, although the presence of MMLs had little effect on the cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA1 (Hill coefficient value: 1.477 with MMLs vs. 1.433 without MMLs) at lower concentrations of MBP-protA, it substantially stimulated the cooperativity at higher protein concentrations (43 \u03bcM), as the Hill coefficient value was dramatically increased from 2.429 (Fig. 2G ) to 6.163 (Fig. 3D) . Taken together, we conclude that the cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA is stimulated by MMLs only at high protein A concentrations.",

The various phospholipid compositions of intracellular membranes are the key determinants of the activities of membranes as well as membrane-associated proteins (van Meer et al., 2008) . Thus, we further analyzed the in vitro RNA binding activity of protein A with liposomes that form mitochondrial outer membranes. These liposomes were generated from equal amounts of purified individual cellular phospholipids as described in Materials and Methods. A series of dose-response assays were performed to determine the effect of distinct liposomes on the RNA binding activity of protein A (Fig. 4A) , and the data was graphed as the fold of the RNA binding activity of protein A without lipids. As shown in Fig. 4B , anionic phospholipid 1,1 0 ,2,2 0tetraoleoyl cardiolipin (CL) had substantial stimulation effects; anionic phospholipids 1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphate (PA), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (PG), and 1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-[phospho-L-serine] (PS) had moderate stimulation effects; and zwitterionic lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PE) had minimal effects. These results show that RNA binding of protein A is selectively enhanced by specific anionic phospholipids. Since zwitterionic lipids showed no obvious effect on protein A, we sought to determine whether zwitterionic lipids affect the cooperative binding of protein A to RNA1. Thus, we conducted RNA binding experiments under the conditions described in Fig. 3C except that 2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl MMLs was replaced by 2 \u03bcg/\u03bcl PC. The RNA binding data was applied to Hill transformation (Fig. 4D ) and compared to that in the absence of ( Fig. 2G ) and presence of MMLs (Fig. 3D ). The cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA1 in the presence of PC was similar to that in the absence of MMLs. The presence of PC resulted in little effect on the cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA at low protein concentrations (0.1-2 \u03bcM) (Hill coefficient value: 1.342 with PC vs. 1.433 without PC) and high protein concentrations (4 2 \u03bcM) (Hill coefficient value: 2.7022 with PC vs. 2.429 without MMLs). These results further confirm that protein A-RNA1 interactions are selectively stimulated by specific anionic phospholipids.",

To examine this possibility, we incubated the increasing amounts of MMLs with RNA1 (50-118) probe and 0.5 \u03bcM MBP-protA fragments. As shown in Fig. 5C , increasing MML concentrations dramatically enhanced the RNA binding of protein A aa 1-254 (lanes 9-12), but did not affected the RNA binding of protein A aa 660-1014 (lanes 1-4) due to the lack of membranebinding activity as expected. Moreover, we used a mutant protein A aa 1-254 fragment, aa 1-254/M1 (K91A, W92A, and R93A), whose MML-binding and RNA-binding activities are intact but self-interaction activity is nulled as described previously . Our data show that MMLs only moderately stimulate the RNA binding of aa 1-254/M1 (Fig. 5C, lanes 5-8) , indicating that the substantial stimulatory effect of MMLs on the RNA binding requires the self-interaction of protein A.

To advance the understanding of the relationship between intracellular membranes and viral RNA replicases, we studied the direct effects of MMLs on the RNA binding of WhNV protein A. We uncover that WhNV protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner, and the cooperativity could be stimulated by high protein A concentrations. MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding activity of protein A, and this stimulation exhibited strong selectivity for different phospholipids. Interestingly, MMLs stimulated the RNA-binding cooperativity only at higher protein A concentrations. Furthermore, manipulating phospholipid metabolisms significantly inhibited protein A-induced RNA1 recruitment/stabilization in cells. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the important role of MMLs in the RNA binding activity of WhNV protein A to properly function as a viral RNA replicase.",

The direct RNA-protein interaction was stimulated by MMLs (Fig. 3A) indicating that MMLs play a direct role in regulating the activity of WhNV protein A to recruit viral genomic RNA. Binding to RNA in a cooperative manner can be advantageous for genomic RNA recruitment, since this may increase the stability of 1 and 3-6 ) or control IgG (lane 2). The immunoprecipitated complexes were divided into two equal fractions. One of fractions was blotted with an anti-HA antibody to determine the self-interaction of protein A. The ( \u00fe )RNA1E associated with the immunoprecipitated protein A was separated from the other fraction and following analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. (B) Graph of the ratios of the accumulation of ( \u00fe )RNA1E analyzed by real-time RT-PCR as described above and protein A self-interaction versus protein A's accumulation. The accumulation of RNA and protein is normalized to 18S rRNA and GAPDH from total cells, respectively. Error bars represent S.D. values from at least three independent experiments. protein-RNA complexes in cells. Therefore, many viral proteins, including NS5B of HCV (Wang et al., 2002) , 3D of poliovirus (Arnold and Cameron, 1999) , p33 of Tomato bushy stunt virus (Rajendran and Nagy, 2003) and N protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Chang et al., 2009) were all found to bind viral RNAs cooperatively. The novel findings of this current work are that the cooperativity of WhNV protein A binding to RNA1 can be stimulated by MMLs and, very interestingly, this stimulation takes effect only at high protein A concentrations (Figs. 2G and 3D; Hill co-efficient: 6.613 vs 2.429 at high concentrations; 1.477 vs 1.433 at low concentrations). The functional significance of this phenomenon is currently not known. A reasonable speculation is that MMLs regulate viral replication by modulating the distribution of viral genomic RNA between translational machinery and vRCs during different stages of viral infection. At a very early stage, few viral genomic RNAs and replicases exist, and the priority of nodaviral RNA1 is to function as mRNA to translate sufficient protein A. As more and more protein A molecular is translated from RNA1 and moves to membranes, resulting in the increased density of protein A on membranes, the priority of RNA1 subsequently shifts to replicate more viral RNAs. Thus, at this stage, the cooperative binding of protein A to RNA1 was substantially stimulated by MMLs, thereby resulting in the recruitment of otherwise cytoplasmic RNA1 to membranes to form vRCs.",

            "text": "Most (\u00fe)RNA viruses typically encode multiple viral replicase proteins, and their intermolecular interactions are critical for RNA replication (Diaz et al., 2012; Dye et al., 2005; Panavas et al., 2005; Panaviene et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2002) . For nodavirus, the selfinteraction of protein A, the sole replicase, is required for RNA replication (Dye et al., 2005) . Moreover, three-dimensional analysis showed that FHV protein A forms higher-order oligomers in spherules (Kopek et al., 2007) . These results indicated that the polymerization of nodaviral protein A is required for RNA replication. However, the precise role of polymerization/self-interaction is currently not known. The study reported here highlighted the relationship between the RNA binding and self-interaction of nodaviral protein A. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that MMLs stimulate the RNA binding of protein A to RNA by promoting its self-interaction. First, we showed that protein A aa 1-254/M1 mediates RNA binding and MML binding, whereas protein A aa 1-254 are responsible for RNA binding, MML binding and protein A self-interaction (Fig. 5C ). The RNA binding of protein A aa 1-254/ M1 was moderately affected by MMLs, whereas the RNA binding of protein A aa 1-254 was substantially stimulated by MMLs (Fig. 5C) , indicating that the substantial stimulatory effect of MMLs on the RNA binding requires protein A self-interaction. However, the contribution of the direct MML-protein A interaction to the RNA binding cannot be omitted but may not be the main reason for the substantial stimulation of MMLs on protein A binding to RNA. Furthermore, we found that higher concentrations of FL protein A stimulated the cooperativity of its binding to RNA even in the absence of MMLs (Fig. 2G) . Given that protein-RNA interaction occurred in a pure reaction solution, which contains only RNA probe and protein A, the higher concentration-induced increase in protein A self-interaction should be the cause of the enhanced cooperativity of protein A binding to RNA1. Therefore, our findings indicate that MMLs stimulate protein A self-interaction, which in turn substantially promotes the efficiency of the cooperative binding of protein A to RNA. The activities of per unit protein A recruiting (\u00fe)RNA1E and self-interaction are tightly linked in cells further confirm the relationship between these two activities of protein A (Fig. 7) .",

Many previous studies showed that certain phospholipids have different effects on different ( \u00fe) RNA replicases. The particular phospholipids enriched in certain intercellular membranes, which are associated with different viruses, show preferential and direct effects on the activities of replicases. According to nodavirus, WhNV protein A activities (Fig. 4) can be mediated by specific anionic phospholipids CL, PA and PG that are enriched in mitochondrial membranes (van Meer et al., 2008) , the sites of which WhNV and FHV protein As are associated with (Miller and Ahlquist, 2002; Miller et al., 2001; Qiu et al., 2013) . These certain lipids may mediate protein A activities by partitioning protein A into liposome fraction and thus leading to the increase of protein A's local density. Indeed, the RNA binding to protein A is cooperative, and the cooperativity could be enhanced by higher protein A concentration (Fig. 2G) , indicating that protein As show stronger RNA binding activity when they are gathered together.",

For competition experiments, unlabeled competitors (applied in molar excess as indicated in Fig. 2 ) were added simultaneously with the labeled RNA probe to the binding reaction. After the binding reaction, the samples were analyzed via 1.0% or 2.0% agarose gel electrophoresis run at 100 V in 0.5 \u00c2 TBE buffer in a cold room and transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes via capillary transfer. The membranes were incubated for 30 min with anti-DIG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche), exposed to film. The RNA probe representing the RNA1 was labeled with DIG-UTP for in vitro transcription. The values of Hill coefficient, an indicator of the cooperativity of RNA-binding, were calculated using Hill transformation of the RNA-binding data obtained in repeated experiments. An apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for protein-RNA interaction, the concentration of the protein at which 50% of RNA was retarded, was also determined on the basis of these data.",
