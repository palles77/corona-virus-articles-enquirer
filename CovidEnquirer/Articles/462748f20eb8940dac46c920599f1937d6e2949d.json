In addition, passive transfer of splenocytes was undertaken to assess if they confer any degree of immunity to immunologically na\u00efve recipient mice. Thus, antisera and splenocytes were collected from groups of mice that had been vaccinated with MVA-VP2, or wild type MVA (MVA-wt), for passive immunisation of recipient mice. The latter were subsequently challenged with AHSV-4 (together with appropriate vaccinated or unvaccinated control animals) and protection was assessed by comparing clinical signs, lethality and viraemia between treated and control groups. All antiserum recipients showed high protection against disease (100% survival rates even in mice that were immunised 48 h after challenge) and statistically significant reduction or viraemia in comparison with the control groups. The mouse group receiving splenocytes from MVA-VP2 vaccinates, showed only a 40% survival rate, with a small reduction in viraemia, compared to those mice that had received splenocytes from MVA-wt vaccinates. These results confirm the primarily humoral nature of protective immunity conferred by MVA-VP2 vaccination and show the potential of administering MVA-VP2 specific antiserum as an emergency treatment for AHSV.",

AHSV is closely related to bluetongue virus, which causes bluetongue disease in ruminants. The orbiviruses are characterised by a genome composed of ten linear segments of dsRNA, with one copy of each of the ten segments packaged within each virus particle. The spherical, non-enveloped capsid of AHSV is approximately 70 nm in diameter, is composed of three concentric protein layers (Roy et al., 1994) . The outer-capsid layer is formed by two major structural proteins, VP2 and VP5 (encoded by genome-segments 2 and 6 respectively), and is primarily involved in cell attachment and cell entry. VP2 is the most variable antigen of AHSV and is responsible for serotype definition (Burrage et al., 1993) .",

The survival rates (40%) and viraemia levels of Group 3 did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) from those of Group 4. However, a reduction of clinical score values in Group 3 relative to Group 4 was statistically significant (P = 0.008). Altogether, these data indicate that cell mediated immunity does not play a critical role in the high level of protection that was afforded against the homologous serotype by MVA-VP2 vaccination (see Table 4 ).",

Thus, two groups of mice were passively immunised, as indicated in Section 2, and were subsequently infected with AHSV-4, together with two vaccinated groups. As expected, the mice that were vaccinated with MVA-wt (Group 9) developed clinical signs typical of AHS in the IFNAR \u00c0/\u00c0 mouse model (Table 5 ). These started on day 3 post-infection and reached the humane end-point between days 5 and 10 post-challenge. All mice from this group were euthanised. In contrast, mice from all other groups survived the challenge and developed, at most, very mild clinical signs. Survival was significantly (P < 0.001) lower for mice in Group 9 compared with all other Groups. The clinical scores were also significantly higher (P < 0.001) in Group 9 compared with all of the other Groups, and in Group 8 compared with Groups 5, 7 and 10.",

Thus, the levels of protection from the serum transfer experiment can be ranked in the following order: Group 10 > Group 5 > Group 6 = Group 7 > Group 8 > Group 9. These data collectively indicate that transfer of antiserum was protective when given in a time window of plus or minus 48 h around the time of challenge. This protection is defined by a complete prevention of lethality of AHSV infection, a significant reduction of clinical signs and a significant reduction of viraemia for every sampling point. Protection was maximum when the dose was increased (Group 5, 400 ll/mouse) and when the administration was performed prior to virus challenge (Group 7, serum transferred 48 h before challenge). As expected the administration of the antiserum 48 h after challenge (Group 8) was less protective than in Groups 5, 6 and 7, but even in these conditions the affected mice recovered and clinical signs had completely disappeared by day 10 post-infection.",

MVA vector vaccines for viral infections have proven to be effective against a wide range of viral diseases (Gilbert, 2013) , such as Chikungunya (Garcia-Arriaza et al., 2014) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (Chen et al., 2005) . Humoral and cellular immune responses elicited against a foreign MVA-encoded antigen are higher than those triggered with the vaccinia Western Reverse strain, in part due to the higher levels of expression of the foreign antigen by MVA (Ramirez et al., 2000) . Moreover, MVA is able to elicit strong, specific responses under conditions of pre-existing immunity to the vector (Ramirez et al., 2000) , as seen in previous studies using MVA in both prime and boost immunisations.",

            "text": "The use of MVA based vaccines, in heterologous prime-boost vaccination regimes, is most often pursued for diseases where cell-mediated immunity definitely plays an important role in protection, as in the case of Plasmodium falciparum (Ogwang et al., 2013) , HIV (Gomez et al. 2012; Cosma et al., 2003) , or influenza (Berthoud et al., 2011) . However, MVA based vaccines are also able to elicit strong antibody responses (Draper et al., 2013) . MVA has been used to develop a promising antibody-inducing vaccine against viral surface proteins, such as the haemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus (Kreijtz et al., 2009) , or the spike glycoprotein of SARS (Chen et al., 2005) . In vaccination studies for BTV, MVA has been very effective as a vaccine, inducing a robust VNAb response against the expressed VP2 protein (Calvo-Pinilla et al., 2009; Jabbar et al., 2013) . Similarly, MVA expressing AHSV-VP2 has been shown to elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies (Castillo-Olivares et al., 2011; Chiam et al., 2009) . A previous passive immunisation study showed that MVA-VP2 vaccination induces a highly protective humoral immune response against AHSV . In that study, AHSV-specific interferon-c secreting CD8+ T cells were also induced by vaccination with MVA-VP2, but their role in protection could not be evaluated at that time. Previously, Pretorius et al. (2012) demonstrated an increase of virus specific CD8+ T-cells in horses, in response to vaccination with live attenuated AHSV. Vaccination studies in mice using recombinant MVA expressing AHSV-4 NS1, administered in combination with MVA-VP2, also showed specific T-cell responses and a reduction in viraemia following heterologous challenge (de la Poza et al., 2013) . In addition, a recombinant Canarypox expressing AHSV-VP2 and VP5 was able to induce VP2specific CD8+ T-cell responses, alongside VNAb. This suggests cellmediated immunity could play a significant role in the overall level of protection against AHSV (El Garch et al., 2012) . However, a clear demonstration of the protective effect of this effector mechanism of immunity, through adoptive transfer of CD8+ T-cells has not yet been reported.",

This suggests that the role of cell-mediated immune responses is less important than the antibody responses in the protection generated by MVA-VP2 vaccination. In addition, it can be argued that the marginal protection against AHSV shown by the recipients of splenocytes could be due to AHSV-VP2-specific B cells contained in the transferred cells. Additional adoptive transfer experiments using cell-sorted CD8+ lymphocytes from donors before challenge could help to elucidate the precise contribution of cell-mediated immunity following MVA-VP2 vaccination.",
