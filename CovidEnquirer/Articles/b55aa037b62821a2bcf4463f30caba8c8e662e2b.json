In adults, community-acquired bacterial pneumonia has been well studied, but viral pneumonia is less well understood.

Patients and methods: We conducted a retrospective study of outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia at the Fever Clinic of Peking University Third Hospital. We collected sputum or throat swabs from patients diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia. Multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed for 20 pathogens, including 9 viruses, 3 atypical pathogens and 8 bacteria.",

Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was detected at the highest frequency (19.0%), exceeding Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. The most commonly identified viral pathogens were IFVs (15.1%), PIVs (3.4%) and RhV (2.6%). The most commonly identified bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.1%), Haemophilus influenza (6.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.6%). Conclusion: Our study suggests that viruses were commonly detected in outpatients with CAP, and IFVs were the most common viruses, especially during flu season. Patients with viral infection were prone to viral-bacterial coinfection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the leading pathogen in the outpatients with CAP. Viral infection occurs in a large number of outpatients with CAP, and it should receive greater attention in clinical work.",

The Global Burden of Disease Study reported that lower respiratory tract infection remains the second largest cause of death and years of life lost in 2013. 1 CAP is a disease that is diagnosed by clinical, epidemiological, radiographic and laboratory characteristics, and the clinician usually relies on empirical evidence when determining therapy, which can lead to antibiotic abuse. Therefore, the detection of respiratory pathogens is very important for the clinician to be able to treat CAP. Pathogens called bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause pneumonia. In adults, bacterial pneumonia has been extensively studied, but viral pneumonia is not as well understood. With the help of new diagnostic technologies, viral respiratory tract infections are being identified as common etiologies of CAP. In adults, approximately 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year, and 15-56% of CAP cases are associated with RVIs. 2, 3 We designed this study to identify pathogens, including common pneumonia-causing bacteria, viruses and atypical pathogens, by multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).",

CAP was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of Chinese adult community-acquired pneumonia (2016 edition), developed by the Chinese Society of Respiratory Medicine: (1) fever (a body temperature >38.0\u00b0C) or hypothermia (a body temperature <35.5\u00b0C); (2) leukocytosis (a white blood cell count >10,000/ml) or leukopenia (a white blood cell count <4000/ml); (3) signs/symptoms of cough, sputum, respiratory symptom aggravation (with or without purulent sputum), chest pain, dyspnea and hemoptysis; (4) chest radiological imaging features such as patchy infiltration, leaf segment consolidation shadow, and interstitial inflammation change (with or without pleural effusion); and (5) signs of lung consolidation or rales on lung auscultation.

An etiological diagnosis could be established in 153 (65.9%, 153/232) patients. A viral diagnosis was made in 62 (26.7%, 62/232) patients. The rate of single virus infection was 15.1% (35/232) and the polymicrobial infection (viruses + bacteria, viruses + atypical pathogens, and two viruses) was 11.6% (27/232). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in 44 samples (19.0%, 44/232), and Chlamydia pneumoniae was only detected in 1 sample, while the rate of single Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was 12.5% (29/232). A bacterial diagnosis was made in 46 (19.8%, 46/232) patients, while the rate of single bacterial infection was 7.8% (18/232), and the polymicrobial infection (bacteria + viruses, bacteria + atypical pathogens) was 12.1% (28/ 232). The number of bacteria plus atypical pathogens was 17, and the number of bacteria plus viruses was 11. The most commonly identified viral pathogens were IFVs [33 (IFA=26, 11.2% and IFB=9, 3.9%), 15.1%], PIVs (8, 3.4%), and RhV (6, 2.6%). The most commonly identified nonviral pathogens were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (44, 19.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (21, 9.1%), Haemophilus influenza (15, 6.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 2.6%) (Table 1).",
