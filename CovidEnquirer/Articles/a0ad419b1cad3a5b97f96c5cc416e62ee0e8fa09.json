For this purpose, the heart can be described as an in-series, 2-stage, rate-variable, one-way pump. From this characterization, the heart must provide sufficient force to eject the blood it receives, respond to the host's needs by varying the amount of blood ejected per unit time, and finally, ensure one-way flow without impediment of forward flow as well as prevent backflow. As befits a biological pump, the heart is a physically active organ that rhythmically contracts and relaxes which, over an average 10-year lifetime of a dog, beats in the vicinity of 400 million times and receives and ejects ten million liters of blood-by any measure, a remarkable and sustained performance.",

We are concerned predominantly with the diseases that interfere with the heart's rate and rhythm, its strength of contraction, and the flow of blood through the heart.

The left and right coronary arteries arise, respectively, behind the left and right cusps of the aortic valve at the base of the aorta. The left coronary artery gives rise to the left descending and the left circumflex coronary arteries. The epicardial coronary arteries give rise to the intramural arteries that penetrate the myocardium. Most coronary arterial blood flow occurs during ventricular diastole, when the coronary microcirculation is not compressed by myocardial contraction. The myocardial conduction system consists of modified cardiac myocytes that initiate and conduct an electrical impulse ( Fig. 1-1) . The sinus node (sinoatrial node, SA node) is located subepicardially at the junction of the cranial vena cava and the right auricle. Because cells in the sinus node are not capable of remaining in a depolarized state, after each repolarization, their membranes permit leakage of sodium and potassium until they reach a stage of depolarization (the critical threshold), when they rapidly depolarize. The impulse from this pacemaker (the dominant pacemaker) in turn causes atrial depolarization and contraction, and travels through internodal bundles to the AV node located in the interatrial septum just cranial to the coronary sinus. The impulse slows while traversing the AV node before traveling via the AV bundle (bundle of His) to the left and right bundle branches, or crura, through the Purkinje fibers. These modified myocardial cells ramify within the myocardium and transmit the depolarizing impulse to ventricular myocytes.",

            "text": "Although each component of the conduction system has different rates of diastolic depolarization, the sinus node has the most frequent rate and is therefore dominant. The frequency of depolarization of the sinus node is in turn modified by the autonomic nervous system. Atrial and ventricular myocytes do not normally exhibit the property of automaticity. However, when atrial or ventricular myocytes are injured, they may repeatedly depolarize independent of a stimulus from the conduction system and may become dominant pacemakers. There are diseases that specifically affect the conduction system producing dysrhythmias (abnormalities of rate and rhythm), but it is the dysrhythmias resulting from disease injuring the atrial and ventricular myocytes that are most common. The cardiac wall has 3 layers: 1. The epicardium, the outermost layer 2. The myocardium, the thick muscular middle layer 3. The endocardium, the innermost layer, which is continuous with the tunica intima of the great vessels entering and leaving the heart The epicardium, or visceral pericardium, consists of a thin layer of mesothelium resting on elastic fiber-rich connective tissue that merges with that of the myocardium. The epicardium is continuous with the parietal pericardium, which consists of an inner mesothelial layer and a thick layer of collagen and elastic fibers. The cavity between the visceral and parietal pericardium contains serous fluid that lubricates the surfaces and reduces friction between the epicardium and pericardium during cardiac motion. Although the pericardial sac is not a vital organ, its proper function includes prevention of sudden cardiac dilation, assurance of equal end-diastolic transmural pressures throughout the ventricles, limitation of right ventricular stroke work, hydrostatic compensation for gravitational or inertial forces, reduction of friction, and maintenance of cardiac alignment and streamlined cardiac flow. original state and is often left thickened, shrunken, and distorted. Affected valves may be either insufficient or stenotic or both, but one or the other usually predominates. Distortions of the structure of heart valves in the absence of vegetations and with an intact valvular endothelium are commonly encountered. Valves can be effaced, displaced, shrunken, thickened, or, in the case of the AV valves, no longer firmly anchored to the papillary muscles. All result, to a greater or lesser extent, in a diminution of effective unidirectional blood flow. Probably the best examples of distortions in architecture are those seen in congenital heart disease, such as valvular aortic and pulmonic stenosis, left and right AV valvular stenosis or insufficiency. Similar lesions can be seen in acute or healed valvular endocarditis and degenerative diseases of the AV valves, such as endocardiosis in dogs. Abnormal chamber or great vessel communication is of special interest because of the altered hemodynamics that ensue in the transition from fetal to postnatal life. Predominantly congenital in origin, it is often the result of incomplete closure of fetal communications between the atria, ventricles, and great vessels following birth. Acquired arteriovenous communication can also occur.",

            "text": "Valvular abnormality from any cause can lead to disturbances of blood flow through the heart either by altering the normal unidirectional pattern of flow, or by impeding blood flow into or out of the chambers. Alterations in hemodynamics reflect changes in systolic workloads characterized by changed pressure loading during contraction (afterload), or changed volume loading during diastole (preload) . Most valvular disorders impose only a single preload or afterload on the heart. This encompasses those valvular disorders that cause either insufficiency (failure to close) or stenosis (narrowing, failure to open) . Some of the congenital heart abnormalities, such as patent ductus arteriosus and tetralogy of Fallot, have multiple preload and afterload effects. The general rules are (eFig. 1-2): 1. Valvular insufficiency increases the preload on the ventricle. 2. Semilunar valvular stenosis, outflow tract stenosis, and hypertension increase the afterload on the ventricle. 3. AV valvular stenoses and pericardial disorders decrease the preload on the ventricles. Subendocardial hemorrhage is a frequent accompaniment to a myriad of diseases of the heart, but more particularly, with systemic disease, where the heart is just another surface where hemorrhage can be observed. Subendocardial mineralization occurs as either a dystrophic or metastatic phenomenon. Additions to valves and/or the mural endocardium result from disturbances to the health of the endothelial lining of the mural and valvular endocardium, and because of the location, can have wide-ranging consequences. The most severe and extensive occurs with microorganisms, particularly bacteria, that arrive via the systemic circulation that adhere to endothelium and/or subendocardium after the endothelium has been damaged or eroded. The cascade of events that follow, especially the incitement of thrombosis, results in a mass of platelets, fibrin, and inflammatory cells (vegetations) accumulating on the exposed surfaces, impeding blood flow through the heart and predisposing to thrombotic emboli lodging in end-arteries in organs throughout the host.

Any disease affecting the conducting fibers-the intra-atrial conduction pathways, the AV node, the common bundle, right and left bundle branches, or Purkinje fibers-can result in a decrease or an absence of impulse conduction. These are manifest as various forms of bradyarrhythmias (heart block), such as sinoatrial arrest; first-, second-, and third-degree heart block; and left and right bundle branch block. By far and away the most significant and most common disturbances of impulse formation are those that arise from injury to atrial and ventricular myocytes. Common causes include electrolyte disturbances, coronary arterial thrombosis or embolism, nutritional deficiencies, bacterial and viral infections, and toxins, especially plant toxins. The predominant alterations in heart rate and rhythm are an increased rate and an erratic rhythm (tachyarrhythmias). It should be noted that arrhythmias arise from the inappropriate depolarization of injured components of the conduction system or cardiac myocytes (ectopic pacemakers) that are often in close proximity to necrotic/apoptotic myocytes. The major pathophysiologic effect of disturbances of the heart's rate rhythm or conduction is erratic filling and contraction, leading to a depression in cardiac output.

An increase in ventricular wall thickness or mass should lead the investigator to search for a cause of increased workload performed by the heart, such as a stenotic valve, or a shunt between chambers or great vessels, which produce an increased afterload on the heart. If no obvious cause for the increased mass can be discerned, a primary myocardial disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, should be considered. A dilated ventricular lumen accompanied by a normal to thin ventricular wall leads toward consideration of an increased preload on the heart, such as AV or semilunar valvular insufficiency or a vascular shunt. In the absence of an inciting cause, dilated cardiomyopathy should be considered. Focal pale areas in an otherwise normally appearing myocardium suggest destruction of cardiac myocytes alone, cellular infiltration alone, or a combination of the two. The most common causes include bacterial and viral infections as well as nutritional deficiencies and toxins that induce necrosis of cardiac myocytes. Metastatic neoplasms should also be considered. Although rare in domestic animals, a special type of focal, well-circumscribed area of paleness with a reddened periphery is indicative of a recent infarct following thrombosis of a coronary artery.

The usual tissue block taken for routine histology is of left ventricular papillary muscle, as this area is one of the most susceptible to damage and most representative in cases of generalized disease. Detailed examination of the heart, including the conduction system, requires collection of tissue blocks ( Fig. 1-9B ) from the junction of the cranial vena cava and right auricle (sinus node), both atria, the interatrial septum/dorsum of the ventricular septum at the base of the heart just cranial to the coronary sinus (atrioventricular node), right ventricular free wall and AV valve, ventricular septum, left ventricular \u2022 Incise the pericardial sac and examine the pericardial fluid before the thoracic viscera are removed; note the volume and color of the fluid, the presence of fibrin, and so forth. \u2022 Remove the thoracic viscera and examine the external surfaces of pericardium, epicardium, and great vessels. \u2022 Open the abdominal aorta in situ to the iliac bifurcation and examine for such abnormalities as thrombi and verminous arteritis; remove the aorta with the abdominal viscera in a horse to better examine the cranial mesenteric artery and its branches. \u2022 The heart may be detached from the lungs if anomalies are absent, but it is usually better left attached to allow careful examination of vessels, for instance, pulmonary artery for thrombi. \u2022 Examine the atria, ventricles, and coronary arteries externally, and confirm normal relationships. \u2022 When opening the heart, always inspect structures before cutting, and try to preserve a stenotic or dilated valve or vessel. \u2022 Open the right atrium, from the caudal vena cava to the tip of the auricular appendage. Note any thrombus, and check the right AV valve and the foramen ovale/fossa ovalis. Leave the cranial vena cava unopened, as a block of tissue to include the sinus node may be taken at the junction of the cranial vena cava and the right auricle. Examine the right AV valve before cutting. \u2022 Open the lateral side of the right ventricle adjacent to the ventricular septum. Examine the right AV valve and chordae tendineae. The septal leaflet of the right AV valve is normally thicker than the free leaflets. Transect the moderator band (trabecula septomarginalis). \u2022 Cut through the rostral wall of the right ventricle, and open the pulmonic valve if there is no stenosis. Check the pulmonary arteries for thrombi, especially in animals with indwelling jugular catheters. Note the patency or closure of the ductus arteriosus (bear to the right when opening the pulmonary artery in neonates to avoid cutting through a patent ductus arteriosus and creating a false anomaly). \u2022 Open the left atrium by cutting into the auricular appendage and then parallel to the ventricular groove. Examine the interatrial septum, foramen ovale/fossa ovalis, and the left AV valve. \u2022 Open the left ventricle by cutting longitudinally through the free wall (from base to apex), examining the left AV valve before cutting it. Chordae tendineae should be carefully examined before cutting the left AV valve to ensure that pre-existing ruptures of the chordae are detected. \u2022 Continue to follow the blood flow by cutting through the left ventricular outflow tract and into the aorta.

Hence, in neonatal hearts, the wall thickness of the left and right ventricles is approximately equal; it is not until a month or more after birth that the mature proportions are attained. Ventricular wall thickness is poorly correlated with ventricular mass, and heart weights provide more valid information about ventricular hypertrophy than do thickness measurements, especially in cases of dilation and eccentric hypertrophy. To accurately assess cardiac mass, the heart should be weighed and the weight compared to body weight. After removing the pericardial sac and postmortem blood clots, ",

There are alterations in the pressures in cardiac chambers and great vessels, the pattern of blood flow, and the volume of blood flow. Because of these changes, the retention postnatally of fetal vascular communications, such as the ductus arteriosus, may place an excessive load on the heart in the postnatal period and beyond. There are also congenital heart defects, such as pulmonic stenosis, which compromise the fetus, the newborn, and the adult. It is typically only those defects that allow adequate in utero development and a reasonably successful perinatal life that are recognized; anomalies sufficiently severe to cause death in utero, or in the neonatal period, often are not. As with most diseases, there is a spectrum of change. The variation in severity of a particular lesion may be wide and will necessarily influence whether clinical signs are observed. As such, there is a higher incidence of congenital heart disease than is recognized clinically. There is also a group of congenital heart diseases that do not produce clinical signs of heart failure, but which are manifested by upper alimentary dysfunction. Although little is known of the causes of many cardiac malformations in domestic mammals, there is no doubt that, especially in dogs, some are genetically determined. The demonstration that some congenital heart diseases are genetically determined arose from the observation that the incidence of defects was higher in purebred populations. It has been thought that both patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and conotruncal defects have a polygenic inheritance pattern, where the full expression of these diseases depends on the inheritance of a number of genes from different loci. However, studies on Keeshonds with conotruncal defects indicate that the inheritance pattern is most compatible with a single autosomal locus. The data suggest the presence of a mutant allele that is partially penetrant in heterozygotes and fully penetrant in homozygotes. Congenital subaortic stenosis in the Newfoundland dog is also genetically determined; it may either be polygenic or a single dominant gene that is variably expressed.

There appears to be a high incidence of spontaneous postnatal closure of small VSDs in humans, and a similar phenomenon has been reported in dogs. The presence of a VSD has no deleterious effect on the fetus because left and right ventricular pressures are equal, and there is therefore little flow across the defect. Postnatally, the effects of VSDs are related to the size of the defect and the level of pulmonic vascular resistance relative to the systemic resistance. Pulmonary vascular resistance normally drops postnatally, leading to a left-to-right shunt. Left ventricular output is maintained by an increase in end-diastolic volume and augmentation of contractility by the Frank-Starling mechanism. Because right ventricular pressure equals left ventricular pressure, the right ventricle is confronted with a large systolic and diastolic load. Both ventricles undergo hypertrophy, the left being more obviously eccentric in nature ( Fig. 1-13) .",

The ductus develops from the sixth left branchial arch, and functions in the fetus to divert a major portion of blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. The flow from venous to arterial side is a consequence of the presence of the high vascular resistance of the fetal pulmonary bed. The structure of the normal ductus differs from the adjacent pulmonary artery or aorta. In contrast to the large elastic arteries, the media of the ductus has a dense layer of smooth muscle, which is responsive to a number of compounds.

In uncomplicated cases, the blood flow is from the aorta to the pulmonary artery (left-to-right shunt) during both systole and diastole. Depending upon the ensuing rise of pulmonary arterial pressure, there may be left-to-right flow only during systole. In severe cases, the shunt is reversed and flow from the pulmonary artery to the aorta (right-to-left shunt) occurs. If the ductus is of sufficient size, there is volume overload of the left ventricle and pressure overload of the right ventricle, resulting in compensatory hypertrophy of both ventricles. There is also left atrial dilation resulting from increased pulmonary blood flow ( Fig. 1-15 ). The ascending aorta and pulmonary artery are dilated, probably resulting from a combination of turbulent flow and altered pressure relationships. The development of congestive heart failure with a large PDA is not only related to pulmonary vascular resistance, but also to the ability of the left ventricle to handle volume overload. In dogs where aorticopulmonary shunts were created experimentally, a communication of 3 mm or less in diameter may lead to the slow development of left ventricular hypertrophy, but it is otherwise well tolerated. A window of 5 mm in diameter may lead to pulmonary hypertension, with degenerative changes in pulmonary vessels and congestive heart failure.",

The length of the patent ductus may also vary. In some cases, there is virtually no ductus, but, instead, an opening between the aorta and pulmonary artery, which are closely approximated. Hypoplasia and asymmetry of ductus-specific smooth muscle and the presence of aorta-like elastic tissue in the ductus wall, as has been observed in some cases, may cause patency.

The term pulmonic stenosis encompasses 3 anatomic variations: supravalvular, valvular, and subvalvular or infundibular stenosis. Valvular stenosis, the most common form in dogs, is probably due to disordered fusion of the valve cushions and their failure to hollow out properly. The valve, which is then more or less dome shaped with an irregular central perforation, is surrounded by 3 recognizable sinuses of Valsalva that are small and irregular in form ( Fig. 1-16) . Subvalvular or infundibular stenosis is produced by a ring of connective tissue that encircles the upper portion of the outflow tract of the right ventricle, or by hypertrophy of the crista supraventricularis muscle ridge. With each form, the pulmonary trunk is dilated and thin walled. This is probably due to a combination of turbulent flow and a drop in pressure, creating a venturi effect in the pulmonary artery.

Tetralogy is one of the congenital heart diseases that invariably results in clinical signs. Affected animals fatigue easily and are usually cyanotic and polycythemic. The latter is a response to hypoxia. Growth rate is usually retarded. At least in Keeshonds, the condition is inherited as a defect at a single autosomal locus, in which there is partial penetrance in heterozygotes and complete penetrance in homozygotes. Analysis of affected Keeshonds has revealed various grades of malformation. The spectrum of anomalies included subclinical defects of the crista supraventricularis, VSD, pulmonic stenosis with abnormal nonpatent interventricular septum, and tetralogy of Fallot. Closure of the interventricular septum is contributed to by the conotruncal septum. The flow of blood from the right ventricle into the As with pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, increased afterload on the left ventricle and turbulent poststenotic flow produce compensatory concentric hypertrophy of the involved ventricle and poststenotic dilation of the aorta ( Fig. 1-21) .

Affected dog breeds include Dogue de Bordeaux and Labrador Retriever. The anatomic characteristics of right AV dysplasia are focal or diffuse thickening of the leaflets, some of which may be absent, or short chordae tendineae and papillary muscles, and direct fusion of portions of just below the aortic valve ( Fig. 1-20) . There may also be involvement of the aortic valve. The subendocardial thickenings are composed of connective tissue in irregular arrangements, intermixed with abundant mucinous ground substance. The change is sometimes fibrocartilaginous in nature. Where there is an accompanying left AV valvular defect, it is composed of a thickened, ridged, and larger cranial leaflet, which process, termed valvular telangiectasis in the septal cusp of the right AV valve in Beagles, has been reported to progress from telangiectasis through scarring and osseous metaplasia. Primary endocardial fibroelastosis is characterized by diffuse endocardial thickening by collagen and elastic fibers, and left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation in the absence of any associated cardiac malformation. The fact that diffuse endocardial thickening occurs when any chamber of the heart remains dilated for a prolonged period has probably led to the confusion that exists about endocardial fibroelastosis. There have been reports in the literature describing the existence of this condition in a number of species, but the primary disease has only been well documented in cats and, to a lesser extent, dogs. The disease in affected Burmese kittens commences with localized endocardial lymphedema. This is detectable microscopically, but not grossly, at 1 day of age. Progressive deposition of endocardial collagen and elastin follows and allows macroscopic detection from 20 days of age. The left atrium is dilated, and the left ventricle is hypertrophied and dilated. The endocardial fibrosis progressively involves cardiac conducting fibers, which exhibit some degenerative change.",

Lesions may cause valvular stenosis, or valvular insufficiency, or both. Stenosis of a valve, or failure to open completely, impedes the forward flow of blood. Valvular insufficiency, alternatively termed regurgitation, or incompetence results in reversed flow of blood. Valvular dysfunction may produce abnormal heart sounds that are detectable clinically as murmurs. The consequences of valvular disease depend upon the rapidity of onset, type, and duration of the lesion, and may be ameliorated by cardiac compensatory mechanisms. The propensity of thrombi to form on the free margins of valves is well known, but the factors leading to it are not. It may be related to the continual movement and the resulting apposition of the surfaces of the free margins of the valves. There are also ill-defined factors, such as intercurrent disease or increased workload, which promote the development of thrombi. The lack of an internal blood supply to the valve may also be a contributing factor, and in common with other vascular structures, injured endothelial cells release inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins, and other substances, such as adenosine diphosphate, which are potent stimulators of platelet aggregation. Once the endothelium is removed, the exposed collagen also stimulates the aggregation of platelets. The presence of the initial thrombus leads to further clotting. In contrast to cardiac myocytes, endothelial cells have a great capacity for regeneration and for covering any breach in their continuity. If the original insult is removed, which without appropriate treatment is not often, the valve heals by fibrosis, but a shrunken, distorted, insufficient, or stenotic valve may remain.",

Minor outbreaks of endocarditis occur in lambs and are usually caused by Streptococcus spp., particularly enterococci; there may be associated polyarthritis. Endocarditis is seldom observed in dogs, but can be associated with a variety of organisms, especially Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and less frequently with Bartonella spp., Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Erysipelothrix tonsillarum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pasteurella multocida, or various Aspergillus spp. (Fig. 1-34A , B). Endocarditis is unusual in cats, but has been caused by Bartonella spp. and Streptococcus spp. In general, neonatal animals are more prone to develop endocarditis in association with septicemias of bacterial origin. The major features of endocarditis are shown in eFigure 1-6. The manner by which bacteria localize on a valve is not clear, and there is seldom detectable evidence of some separate underlying disease of the leaflet. In active thrombotic valvular endocarditis, bacteria are invariably present in the lesion. Two factors that must be included in any concept of pathogenesis are 1. The tendency for lesions to occur at the lines of apposition of the valve surfaces exposed to the forward flow of blood 2. The necessity for sustained or recurrent bacteremia It is possible that simple debilitation of endothelial cells in recurrent bacteremia and aggravated locally on the valves by the trauma of apposition may alter the adhesiveness of the leaflet endothelium sufficiently for bacterial adhesion to occur. It is of significance that valvular endocarditis can be produced in normal animals by a single intravenous injection of bacteria of suitable type and virulence; the incidence of endocarditis is increased if the hearts of such animals are subjected to increased workloads or the valves are traumatized during the experiments. There is also the possibility that bacterial endocarditis can begin within the valve during septicemia, as has been demonstrated by isolation of bacteria from the spongiosa of pig valves.",

With the current techniques of molecular biology, such as PCR, it should be possible to identify at least the genus of the noncultivable organisms embedded in the thrombus. The bacteria that initiate the lesion are enmeshed in the early layers of thrombi and are buried deeply as new layers are formed on the surface. With continued multiplication, many microscopic colonies are formed, and without appropriate antimicrobial treatment, it is their persistence in the protected environment that is the reason healed bacterial endocarditis is seldom seen.

This type of change is observed primarily in ischemic states. Coagulative myocytolysis is typified by the presence of thick, irregular, eosinophilic bands, with an accompanying loss of striations and lightly staining granular areas in myocytes. The bands are hypercontracted sarcomeres (\"contraction bands\") (see Fig. 1-41 ) and the light granular areas are mitochondria. Evidence from experimental models suggests that the alteration is the result of the excessive release of endogenous catecholamines. However, this change may be observed in normal myocardium if it is fixed immediately after death. Colliquative myocytolysis appears as a loss of striations, and homogeneous, weakly eosinophilic cytoplasm. The ultrastructural appearance is characterized by intracellular edema, with disintegration of fibrils and other organelles. Waviness of myocardial fibers is claimed by some to be one of the earliest changes observed in myocardial infarction in humans. The affected fibers are not necrotic, but are thinner and undulating in appearance. It is thought that the waviness is due to irreversible stretching followed by compression of ischemic fibers by the surrounding viable myocardium.

The circumstances of sudden death combined with the gross and microscopic lesions strongly suggest that the affected animals die of acute heart failure following the development of ventricular dysrhythmias . Despite the associated gross and microscopic findings, mulberry heart disease is generally a diagnosis of exclusion; this is particularly the case today when As the syndrome is now well recognized, cats are unlikely to die of TDMF. In cats that do die, gross and histologic cardiac lesions are as described later for feline dilated cardiomyopathy.",

Both the rate and inotropic state of the heart are stimulated by catecholamines. In a number of species, the continuous administration of norepinephrine for 1-2 weeks results in focal myocardial necrosis. Multifocal myocardial necrosis may develop in dogs with paroxysmal tachycardia resulting from functional pheochromocytomas. Also, experimentally induced intracranial hemorrhage produces focal myocardial necrosis, which can be prevented by prior administration of either reserpine, a catecholamine-depleting drug, or propanolol, which blocks \u03b2 receptors.",

As discussed with diseases of muscle (in Vol. 1, Muscle and tendon), selenium is an integral part of the membrane enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which reduces toxic lipid peroxides to hydroxy acids. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and acts synergistically with selenium to protect membranes from high concentrations of lipoperoxides. Field studies, particularly from the Scandinavian countries, have shown that although dietary selenium supplementation markedly reduces the incidence of hepatosis dietetica and nutritional myopathy, the prevalence of mulberry heart disease remains the same. It is also evident that tissue levels of selenium, particularly those in the heart and liver, are within the normal range. It is now considered that vitamin E deficiency plays a central role in the development of mulberry heart disease. However, there is not universal agreement on this. Although some studies show lower tissue levels of vitamin E in affected pigs, others show no difference. Additionally, it has been suggested that the disease is the result of altered vitamin E metabolism and not a consequence of inadequate dietary vitamin E levels. It may be that mulberry heart disease is precipitated following a lack of bioavailability of vitamin E in tissues, or possibly a greater requirement for vitamin E under certain dietary circumstances, such as diets containing large amounts of unsaturated fat.",

Hypothyroidism has been noted as a reversible cause of myocardial failure in 2 Great Danes. striatin gene located on chromosome 17 in affected Boxer dogs is encouraging. Striatin co-localizes in the region of the intercalated disc with 3 desmosomal proteins. Recent evidence also shows that dysfunction in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is involved where there is mislocalization of \u03b2-catenin and striatin and an increase in the total amount of \u03b2-catenin in Boxer dogs with ARVC.",

These ultrastructural changes are not specific for cardiomyopathy, but are more severe than seen with other causes of congestive heart failure. There appear to be 2 histologically distinct forms of DCM: (1) the \"fatty infiltration-degenerative\" type seen, for example, in Boxers and Doberman Pinschers, and (2) the \"attenuated wavy fiber\" type seen in many giant-, large-, and medium-sized breeds, including some Boxers and Doberman Pinschers ( Fig.  1-53B ). This histologic classification of canine DCM may be superior to classification by breed-specific syndromes, because both forms may affect some breeds, such as Boxers and Doberman Pinschers.

It may be nodular or diffuse, although the distinction is arbitrary because there is overlap of the 2 forms. In the nodular form, there are foci, primarily in the atria (particularly the right atrium), which may be up to 5 cm or more in diameter. The nodules are covered by endothelium and are therefore smooth. When beneath the epicardium, they may be difficult to distinguish from epicardial fat. They are prone to central necrosis, and this resembles necrotic adipose tissue. On section, the wall of the atrium is more diffusely thickened, is moderately soft to cut, and has a pale appearance. If squeezed, milky fluid exudes from the cut surface. Globular masses like those beneath the epicardium are also found under the endocardium projecting into the cardiac cavities. In the diffuse or infiltrating form, the myocardium appears irregularly thickened and gray-white, with the ventricular walls being especially involved. These foci or areas of infiltration blend with normal myocardium and hence are difficult to distinguish from foci of myocardial degeneration or myocarditis. If they cause some thickening of the myocardium, such lesions are to be first regarded as lymphoma and indicate the need for careful search for primary lesions elsewhere in the body.

The microcirculation consists of vessels of <100 \u00b5m in diameter: namely, arterioles, terminal arterioles (metarterioles, precapillary sphincter areas), capillaries, postcapillary venules, and venules. This classification overlaps microcirculation and macrocirculation (arteries and veins), but is useful conceptually as will be seen in disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, which affect primarily the microcirculation. Arterioles open through precapillary sphincters or through metarterioles into capillaries in most tissues, or into sinusoids in the liver. Capillaries are lowpressure tubules, of ~8 \u00b5m in diameter, composed of endothelial cells surrounded by a basal lamina; the endothelial cells are connected by tight junctions that allow rapid passage of small molecules such as glucose. The basal lamina is a molecular sieve that prevents passage of larger protein molecules. Capillary endothelial cells possess few endoplasmic organelles, but often contain pinocytotic vesicles. Capillaries may be continuous, the most common type; fenestrated (60-80 \u00b5m fenestrae closed by thin diaphragms), as in the gastrointestinal tract and endocrine glands; or porous (without diaphragms closing the pores), as in renal glomeruli. Fenestration of the endothelial cells allows increased permeability. During tissue healing, cords of endothelial cells grow into the tissues by mitosis, develop lumina, and become functional capillaries. Undifferentiated perivascular cells, or pericytes, are ensheathed by glycocalyx that is continuous with the capillary basal lamina. Mitosis of pericytes is easily stimulated, and they may be transformed into fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells. Sinusoids are less uniform than capillaries and more permeable because there are large openings between the endothelial cells and a discontinuous basal lamina.",

The extent of lipid deposition can be influenced by feeding extraordinary diets containing much lipid, including cholesterol, but the atheromas rarely reach the degree of development seen in humans, and they do not lead to occlusive thrombus formation, which usually requires softening and ulceration of the atheromatous plaque. The initial deposition of lipid occurs in the proliferated smooth muscle cells, which show signs of degeneration and which may become foam cells. Macrophages also appear, containing lipid. Fat may be demonstrable extracellularly, presumably released by degenerate cells. Deposits of cholesterol and mineral, not extensive, may be associated with softening of larger atheromatous plaques. However, except in pigs fed high-fat diets, lipid is usually a minor component of the predominantly fibromuscular plaques.",

The term \"xanthomatosis\" has been applied to the canine condition in the past, but its use is inadvisable as it may cause confusion with the human condition of primary xanthomatosis (type II hyperlipoproteinemia), in which there is premature atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, but also xanthomatous infiltration of the myocardium, dermis, and other organs with an associated granulomatous reaction. A similar condition in other animal species is referred to as xanthomatosis, and is characterized by the presence of lipidladen foam cells in subcutaneous or intracutaneous accumulations known as xanthomas. A familial hyperlipoproteinemia occurs in lipoprotein lipase deficient cats, and results in the formation of xanthomata in a variety of organs; atherosclerosis is not a feature of this condition. only in dogs (Figs. 1-60 to 1-62), and then almost always in association with hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus. In dogs, hypercholesterolemia is chiefly related to hypothyroidism, but even in thyroidectomized, cholesterol-fed, hypercholesterolemic experimental dogs, only occasional dogs classed as \"hyper-responders\" developed atherosclerosis, perhaps as a result of an increased proportion of cholesterol-rich VLDL. A breed predisposition to atherosclerosis in Miniature Schnauzers may be the result of idiopathic hyperlipoproteinemia. The deposition of lipids in dogs begins in the middle and outer layers of the media and occurs more extensively perhaps in the small muscular arteries than in the large elastic ones; if present, aortic lesions occur as intimal plaques. The veins are normal. The vascular changes can be severe enough to be seen on gross inspection. The vessels are enlarged, less pliable than normal, and their walls are thickened and ill-defined because a hyperplastic adventitia merges irregularly with surrounding tissues.

Dilation of the cranial mesenteric artery may occur in the course of verminous arteritis in horses; the arterial wall is often greatly thickened, but the dilation could be termed an inflammatory rather than a true aneurysm. False aneurysms result from rupture of an artery or aneurysm and are essentially hematomas communicating with an arterial lumen; their walls are formed by the surrounding fibrous tissue. ",

Rupture of a uterine artery is a cause of fatal hemorrhage in aged mares at parturition and is associated with low serum copper levels. Mycotic infection in the guttural pouch in horses may lead to focal destruction of the wall of the internal carotid or maxillary artery and can lead to fatal hemorrhage. Rupture of the aorta is well known, but certainly uncommon, in the horse. The ruptures occur during periods of excitement and activity, such as racing or in stallions while breeding, and are probably related to increased intra-aortic pressure. A predisposing aortic lesion has not been definitely identified, but fragmentation, degeneration, and mineralization of elastic fibers may contribute to weakening of the wall. \"Cystic medial necrosis,\" the presence of pools of ground substance within the elastic media, has been suggested to be an underlying cause, but this change is present in the aortas of many normal horses. Intimal thickening and medial fibrosis of vasa vasora may predispose to aortic medial necrosis and rupture. Tears occur in the ascending aorta at any level from the aortic valvular annulus to the level of the brachiocephalic trunk ( Fig.  1-67A ), and range from 0.5-1 cm tears in the right coronary sinus to large transverse or 3-cornered tears in the cranial wall of the aorta. Hemorrhage may occur into a number of different sites. Hemopericardium, the most common sequel to aortic rupture, leads to sudden death; hemorrhage into, and disruption of, the atrioventricular node or bundle of His also leads to sudden death; dissection through the ventricular septum and into the right ventricle (aortocardiac fistula) causes progressive right heart failure; dissection of blood along the aortic wall may lead to formation of an aneurysm, which may in turn rupture.",

Clinical presentations include shock, organ failure, hemorrhage, or hemolysis depending upon the relative activation of thrombin and plasmin and hence the dominance of thrombosis or hemorrhage. Hemorrhage is usually only seen in animals that survive acute episodes with thrombosis and shock, or in those reacting to a moderate procoagulatory stimulus. Perhaps the most common result of acute DIC is shock, which is due to reduced venous return to the right heart, plus systemic and pulmonary arterial hypertension resulting from thrombosis. Specific examples of DIC include \u2022 The generalized Shwartzman-like reaction (GSR) (bilateral hemorrhagic renal cortical necrosis, induced experimentally by timed injections of endotoxin), which is seen as a cause of oliguric renal failure in septicemic or endotoxemic postpartum cows \u2022 Hemorrhagic adrenal necrosis (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome) seen in septicemic calves \u2022 Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MHA) (an intravascular fragmentation anemia) seen in septicemic calves \u2022 Acrocyanosis and gangrene seen in the extremities of calves recovering from septicemia \u2022 The hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), in which coagulation is combined with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure; a similar syndrome is seen in Greyhound dogs with idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (\"Alabama rot\"). Animals that die with DIC may have petechial to ecchymotic hemorrhages on mucosae and serosae and in the skin, and may have variable thrombotic or hemorrhagic involvement of internal organs. Histologically, microthrombi may be associated with congestion, edema, hemorrhage, and necrosis. Microthrombi are most easily detected microscopically in capillaries of brain, renal glomeruli, adrenals, lungs, and myocardium, but may occur in any organ. They consist primarily of fibrin (hyaline thrombi), platelets (granular thrombi), or of fibrin degradation products (hyaline globules or \"shock bodies\"); pulmonary alveolar hyaline membranes are also said to be a form of hyaline microthrombi. Because fibrinolysis is an ongoing process that continues after death, most microthrombi are lysed within 3 hours of death and may not be found if postmortem examination is delayed. With routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, microthrombi appear as homogeneous pink masses in dilated small blood vessels. Identification of microthrombi is aided by the use of special stains such as Martius-scarletblue, which stains fibrin red, or phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH), which stains fibrin purple. Even with special stains, incompletely polymerized fibrin is difficult BOX \u2022 1-1 \u2022 Leukocyte damage, which results in tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin) release Viral infections are postulated to induce DIC by viral- or antiplatelet antibody-mediated platelet aggregation, by causing endothelial damage, and by causing Hageman factor activation by immune complexes. Also, in feline infectious peritonitis for example, hepatic necrosis impairs macrophage clearance of activated clotting factors and may potentiate the coagulation defect. Another important pathophysiologic event that accompanies activation of coagulation is activation of the cardiorespiratory system to adjust to the hypoxia of higher altitudes. There are species differences in the hypertensive response to hypoxia; sheep and dogs are hyporesponders, humans are intermediate, whereas cattle and pigs are hyperresponders and are prone to develop hypertensive heart failure at altitudes of ~2,500 meters and above. There are also variations within species, and some cattle react dramatically to degrees of hypoxia that only mildly inconvenience others. Young cattle are more susceptible than adults, and the morbidity rate is highest in animals exposed to high altitudes for the first time. In animals imported from low altitudes to about 3,500 meters, the incidence of severe pulmonary hypertension approaches 50%, whereas in herds maintained at such altitudes for many generations, high-altitude disease may not affect >2%.

Endothelial damage and exposure of subendothelial collagen leads to activation of Hageman factor, and hence activation of complement, kinin, and plasmin systems, and to increased vascular permeability and inflammation. Infectious agents may cause endothelial damage either directly or through the actions of various toxic products, such as endotoxins of gram-negative bacteria, or exotoxins of bacteria such as Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. Mannheimia haemolytica endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS] ) can directly damage endothelial cells; such damage may be reduced or increased by the activity of neutrophils, depending on the concentration of LPS present. The mechanism of LPS-mediated damage may involve prostaglandins or production of oxygen radicals by endothelial cells. In the absence of LPS, M. haemolytica leukotoxin may contribute to endothelial damage. In the case of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, rather than endotoxin causing endothelial damage, cytotoxicity is apparently caused by a 104 kDa hemolysin. Histophilus somni lipo-oligosaccharide has been shown to cause cytotoxicity and apoptosis of bovine endothelial cells through the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates.

The complexes fix complement, and complement fragments attract neutrophils that release lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, hypochlorous acid) in the process of phagocytosing immune complexes, and hence cause necrosis. As the Arthus reaction matures, neutrophils diminish and mononuclear cells, including plasma cells, predominate. The morphology of immune-complex-mediated vasculitis can be modified by the relative concentrations of immune reactants or secondary mediators; increases in antibody or complement concentrations can change an Arthus-like reaction to a Shwartzman-like reaction. Immune complexes can be found in vessel walls in a variety of immune-mediated conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Aleutian disease of mink, feline infectious peritonitis, and systemic coronavirusassociated disease in ferrets. However, even though immunoglobulins or immune complexes are found in the walls of affected vessels, this is not definitive proof that the immune reaction caused the vasculitis. Conversely, the absence of immune complexes from a vessel wall lesion does not rule out immune-complex vasculitis, because immune reactants can disappear rapidly. The underlying lesion in porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) is necrotizing systemic vasculitis, which has a predilection for skin and kidney, and is thought to have an immune-complex origin; porcine characteristics of the lesion, or clinical effects. However, many cases overlap in their morphologic and clinical manifestations, and are simply termed \"systemic necrotizing vasculitis.\" Improvement in the classification of necrotizing vasculitides will require further characterization of causes and of the spectrum of immune-mediated changes in vessels. Until such time, the use of accurate morphologic descriptions of vascular lesions is preferable to placing vasculitides, especially those of known cause, in such ill-defined categories as \"polyarteritis nodosa.\" The wide range of lesions observed probably reflects the variety of antigens or other agents involved, the intensity and chronicity of antigenic exposure, the relative contributions of immune-complex versus delayed-hypersensitivity reactions, the genetic variation among individuals, and the stage of development at which the lesion is observed.",

These types have a basic antigenic relationship that may be demonstrated in the horse, but the relationship is not sufficiently close to provide solid immunity amongst types. Indeed, although all strains investigated can be fitted into one of the major types, the antigenic diversity of strains within a single type is such that very few strains are identical. This is certainly the situation in enzootic areas where a large number of different strains may be isolated during an outbreak. On the other hand, there has been close antigenic relationship between the viruses recovered during the epizootic outbreaks that occurred outside the reservoirhost range where the transmission was from horse to horse. This suggests that, although the AHSV is extremely mutable, mutations do not readily occur when the disease is transmitted from horse to horse.

Persistent infection (i.e., survival of >30 days) is caused by CSFV strains of moderate or low virulence and may arbitrarily be divided into chronic and late-onset types. In chronic CSF, typical acute disease is followed by clinical improvement, the result of dead of CSF is empty except for a small amount of watery mucus and ingesta. The fundic mucosa is congested, and mild or severe erosions may be present. Specific lesions do not occur in the small intestine, but the mesentery is usually congested. It is in the colon and cecum that the virus combines with the intestinal flora to produce craterous mucosal defects, \"button ulcers,\" which are characteristic of the subacute or chronic stage of the disease. These lesions begin as sharply outlined circular areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. The central area is yellow and dry. As the lesion ages, the rim, which is composed of necrotic epithelium, bacteria, and detritus, is raised above the surrounding mucous membrane, and concentric rings form as if growth were cyclic. The center of lesions sinks giving a slight diskoid shape. If this necrotic tissue and debris is removed, a deep ulcer is revealed. Growth arrest lines may be seen in the ribs of chronically sick pigs. Gross lesions are not usually present in the brain, but the brain should be removed because it is there that the histologic changes can be best appreciated. The major features of the gross postmortem findings are shown in eFigure 1-26. Microscopically, all areas within the brain may be affected, but the lesions are usually most conspicuous in the medulla, pons, mid-brain, and thalamus. The response is largely confined to the vessels and their supporting mesoderm. Many of the venules have eccentric cuffs, which are formed in part by transmural migration of monocytes. Mitotic figures and nuclear chromatin of necrotic cells are frequently present together in the cuff, as proliferation and necrosis are coexistent. Swelling and degeneration of the endothelial cells occur in the walls of the smaller vessels ( Fig. 1-82 ). All changes from slight thickening to necrosis of the wall may be seen. The lumen is often compromised by these reactions. The response of the neural parenchyma appears to be entirely secondary to the vascular lesions; often it is nonexistent or confined to minimal neuronal degeneration, or it may consist of glial nodules formed about obstructed or destroyed capillaries. If severe cerebral edema develops, there may be widespread damage to the oligodendroglia. The vessels of the eyes, choroid plexuses, and the leptomeninges are similarly involved. chronic, the halo may be the dirty brown of partially degraded hemoglobin. Less frequently, the hemorrhage in the node is diffuse. The nodal changes are generalized, but nodes most apt to show severe changes are the mandibular, colonic, hepatic, and iliac; changes in the renal lymph nodes are not useful in this context.",

Adult worms may be found in the right ventricle if more than about 25 are present, and in the right atrium and venae cavae if there are 50 or more worms.

Infective third-stage larvae are ingested; exsheath in the small intestine; penetrate the mucosa and submucosa of the small intestine, cecum, and colon within 3 days of infection; and molt to fourth-stage larvae by day 7. The larval penetration of the gut can cause the formation of large subserosal hemorrhages, called hemomelasma ilei. The fourth-stage larvae, which are about 1 mm long, penetrate submucosal arterioles, migrate in or on the intima of arterioles and arteries, being constrained by the internal elastic lamina from penetrating to the media, and reach the cranial mesenteric artery, the predilection site for further development, between day 11 and 21. After 3-4 months, the larvae molt to the fifth stage (immature adults, 10-18 mm long), return to the wall of the cecum and colon via the intestinal arteries, and are encapsulated in subserosal nodules before returning to the gut lumen as adults, when the nodules rupture. The adults require another 6-8 weeks to reach sexual maturity. The prepatent period of S. vulgaris is thus about 6-7 months.",

They may be in any branch of the cranial mesenteric artery but are concentrated largely in the right division and the colic artery, which is its continuation, and, to a slightly lesser extent, in the cranial branch and its continuation, the right colic artery. The worms are rarely found in the aorta caudal to the origin of the renal vessels; they are relatively common about the origin of the cranial mesenteric and celiac arteries, and less common again in the thoracic aorta. Although this statement on the prevalence of lesions in the thoracic aorta applies to actively thrombotic lesions containing worms, it is probable that older, warty, mineralized lesions of the type often seen in the intima of the aortic arch have this origin; they occur markedly diminished by benzimidazole and macrocyclic lactone anthelmintics. A degree of host resistance to verminous arteritis is slowly acquired under natural conditions, but horses of all ages remain susceptible to infection. Lesions range from the very common, but insignificant, tortuous intimal tracks, to the less common, but more serious, occlusive thrombotic lesions. Lesions of verminous arteritis are often incorrectly called \"verminous aneurysms,\" but these dilations are usually thick-walled resulting from inflammation and scarring, rather than thinned. Saccular or fusiform aneurysms may occasionally result from weakening of the arterial wall. Lesions occur most frequently in the cranial mesenteric artery and its extension, the ileo-cecocolic artery. This apparent larval predilection has been suggested to fit a \"random-walk\" model in which the larvae sense blood vessel curvature, rather than direction of blood flow, migrate longitudinally along arteries, and are essentially trapped in the cranial mesenteric artery because of its perpendicular connection with the aorta, a border which most of the larvae do not cross. Larvae that spill over into the aorta may be considered as aberrant and lost to their species, in that they are unlikely to return to the cranial mesenteric artery and hence to the gut.",

The intima is corrugated, and numerous sinuous tunnelings end in small nodules in the intima and media; the nodules protrude into the vascular lumen or through the adventitia. The males, which are about 7 cm long, inhabit the nodules, along with the anterior end of the female, which bears the vaginal opening, and the microfilariae, which escape into the bloodstream. The body of the female lies in the sinuous tracts, from which the complete specimen cannot be readily dissected, but its length is estimated as >100 cm. Parasitic tunnels in the inner media have a thin fibrous tissue lining without cellular infiltration. There may be acute transmural aortitis with a predominance of eosinophils, but subacute or chronic focal granulomatous inflammation is more frequent and occurs around tunnels containing dead, degenerate, or mineralized worms. The granulomas in the media and adventitia become encapsulated by fibrous tissue to form nodules of 0.5-2.5 cm diameter containing caseous material and intact and/or dead worms, and eventually dry mineralized debris.

Involvement of the cranial mesenteric artery is almost constant in horses, but untoward sequelae are much less common, no doubt resulting from the extensive collateral arterial circulation to the equine intestine, which may mitigate against the effects of frequent thromboembolic episodes. Colic, which is commonly caused in horses by S. vulgaris if parasite control is poor, may occur for a number of reasons: thromboembolism and intestinal ischemia or infarction; interference with innervation of the gut, resulting from pressure on abdominal autonomic plexuses; or, release of toxic products from degenerating larvae. Fatal acute intestinal infarction occasionally ensues, with ischemia of large areas of the cecum or colon. Thromboembolism of the cecal and colic arteries may also lead to mucosal ulceration and diarrhea, and occasionally death. Hematochezia has been reported in a horse as a consequence of fistulous connections between a verminous cranial mesenteric arterial aneurysm and the cecum and ileum. As a result of successful suppression of S. vulgaris by anthelmintics, drug-resistant cyathostomes (small strongyles) have supplanted S. vulgaris as the most important cause of verminous colic. Coronary arterial thrombosis and occlusion, which occurs most commonly in the right coronary artery, can lead to myocardial infarction and death; similar consequences follow the development of verminous aortic valvular endocarditis, a rare event in strongylosis. Embolism of the brachiocephalic trunk can occur and is especially significant when the emboli contain larvae that subsequently migrate in the brain causing encephalomalacia and either chronic incoordination or progressive fatal encephalitis. Renal arterial verminous arteritis and thromboembolism have resulted in renal infarction and, on rare occasions, passage of larvae in the urine. Aortic-iliac thrombosis may be a consequence of strongyle-related thromboembolism, but its pathogenesis remains uncertain.

In heavy infestations and possibly by means of venous shunts developed in the liver, many eggs may pass in venous blood to and beyond the lungs, producing granulomatous endoarteritis and adjacent granulomas wherever they lodge. The development of hepatic lesions follows the same course as for those that develop in the intestinal wall. In the liver, the eggs break out of the portal venules to become enclosed by granulomas.

Eggs, assisted by the secretion of proteolytic enzymes, move from the capillary lumen into the intestinal tract and are expelled in feces. On contact with water, miracidia are released from the eggs and actively seek the snail intermediate host, which completes the life cycle. Clinical signs of the infection in dogs include mucoid to bloody diarrhea, lethargy, weight loss, vomiting, anorexia, and ascites.

They adhere to, and are eventually covered by, the endothelium. The eggs of some species are spinous, and this probably facilitates passive migration into the tissue. The migration does appear, however, to be partly active by virtue of secretions elaborated by the developing miracidium, which diffuse through the shell of the egg into the tissues. These secretions may be also in part responsible for inciting the inflammatory reaction to the eggs. Initially, most of the eggs are deposited in the lamina propria of the intestine, and break into the lumen with little more than mechanical injury. Rupture of congested mucosal venules accounts for the characteristic dysentery of schistosomiasis.

The corded and nodular ulcerating lymphangitis of cutaneous glanders in horses must be distinguished from the specific forms of lymphangitis discussed below. Lymphangitis is often a prominent development in cutaneous streptothricosis in cattle, and can occur in various species with cutaneous sporotrichosis. Lipogranulomatous lymphangitis has been found in association with intestinal lymphangiectasis in dogs.

In the adjacent tissues, which are swollen, small nodules of ~1 cm diameter develop and, in the course of a few days, these ulcerate to discharge, at first, a viscid gray exudate and, later, pus. The initial lesions are intradermal and are freely movable over the subcutaneous tissue. Spread of the infection is solely via the lymphatics, and these convey the organisms into the subcutaneous and, occasionally, into the deeper tissues.

Sometimes the ulcers continue to enlarge and may coalesce. In this way, the cutaneous infection spreads gradually but irregularly, but is always characterized by intradermal and subcutaneous nodules, ulcers, and irregularly swollen lymphatics.

As a result of lymphangitis, there is diffuse swelling in the leg, soon followed by development of dermal nodules. These are abscesses that ulcerate and discharge thick white to light yellow viscous pus that may be bloodstained. Only a small area of skin may be sloughed so that, usually, the margins of the ulcer are undermined. The ulcers heal and leave small areas of depilated, depigmented skin. As the primary ulcers heal, new nodules form in adjacent skin, suppurate, ulcerate, and cicatrize, and in this way, the disease progresses slowly. As the new nodules develop, the lymphatics between them become corded and as much as 1-2 cm thick, and fresh abscesses develop along the inflamed vessels. In uncontrolled infections, over a course of many months much of the skin of the body and neck as well as the limbs may be affected, and this leads to death.

Nodular dermal vascular proliferations occur anywhere in the skin, but especially along the back, may have a considerable inflammatory component, and resemble \"pyogenic granuloma\" of humans. Varicose tumor of the scrotum of dogs is a benign vascular proliferation that resembles cavernous hemangioma when fully developed. Lesions resembling hemangioma occasionally develop in the skin of the scrotum or perineum of boars, or the vulva, mammary glands, or ovaries of sows. Meningioangiomatosis, a rare condition reported in dog, horse, and cow, is characterized by benign focal proliferation A B C arises de novo and not from pre-existing hemangiomas. The tumors have a gray to red-black hemorrhagic appearance, and may reach a diameter of 30 cm in the spleen as a result of hemorrhage within the tumor. Large hemorrhagic masses can often be found in the spleens of dogs; some are hematomas rather than either hemangiomas or hemangiosarcomas. The distinction is important because splenic hemangiosarcomas carry a very poor prognosis. However, the distinction can often be difficult because splenic hemangiosarcomas often hemorrhage, and if the resultant hematoma is not sampled carefully, its neoplastic origin will be missed. Following rupture, implants of splenic tissue or tumor may be found on the peritoneum. Hemangiosarcomas typically metastasize widely, especially to the lungs (\"cannonball\" metastases) ( Fig. 1-100A-C) . Histologically, these tumors consist of vascular spaces lined by elongated, plump, anaplastic endothelial cells ( Fig. 1-101A ). Vascular spaces must be identified in tumors with a highly cellular stroma to differentiate hemangiosarcoma from fibrosarcoma. Hemorrhage and necrosis commonly occur within these tumors, and death may occur because of hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity, pericardial sac, or brain. When metastases are widespread, the primary tumor site may be difficult to determine, and multicentric origin is a possibility. Poorly differentiated hemangiosarcomas may usually be differentiated from spindle cell sarcomas or other non-endothelial neoplasms by immunohistochemical staining for factor VIII-related antigen ( Fig. 1-101B ), a marker of endothelial cells, and claudin-5 protein, a tight-junction protein normally found on endothelial cells. Ulex europaeus lectin, a marker of neoplastic human endothelial cells, is unreliable as a marker of canine vascular tumors. Ultrastructurally, Weibel-Palade bodies (granules",

Brugia malayi occurs in cats and primates in India and Malaysia; cats may be reservoir hosts for human infection. B. patei occurs in dogs and cats in Africa, B. pahangi in dogs and cats in Africa and the East, and B. ceylonensis in dogs in Sri Lanka. Brugia spp. are transmitted by mosquitoes, and their life cycles are similar to those of other filarial worms. Infective larvae enter peripheral lymphatics, migrate to the nearest lymph node and develop for 2 weeks before migrating down afferent lymphatics, where they mature and produce granulomatous lymphangitis, lymphangiectasis, and lymphadenitis, but do not usually cause lymphedema and elephantiasis as occurs in humans, resulting from infection with B. malayi or the closely related Wuchereria bancrofti.

In most instances, the lymphatic lesions are so small as to have no significance, but in some cases, the consequence of lymphatic involvement may be the major presenting clinical sign or lesion. Such, for example, is the case when attention is drawn to papillary carcinoma of the canine ovary by severe ascites; disrupted portions of the neoplasm permeate and obstruct the ventral diaphragmatic lymphatics, which are the main efferent channels of the peritoneal cavity.Lymphedema is defined as swelling of a part of the body by an increased quantity of lymph resulting from a lymphatic system disorder. The term should not be used to describe edematous swellings resulting from venostasis, hypoproteinemia, heart failure, or cellulitis. Lymphedema may be classified as primary or secondary: \u2022 Primary lymphedema, which is usually congenital, and may be hereditary, is due to anomalous development of the lymphatic system. \u2022 Secondary lymphedema occurs because of obstruction of previously normal lymphatics, resulting from inflammation, neoplasia, surgery, or trauma. Lymphedema is of significance because it may predispose the affected area, usually a limb, to secondary bacterial infection and poor wound healing. Prolonged lymphedema leads to fibrosis.A lymphocele is a lymph-filled space that does not have a distinct endothelial lining, and may be the result of disruption of lymphatics by trauma or surgery.",

The lymphatic abnormality is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait in most cases examined. One of the regulators of lymphatic vasculature formation is T1\u03b1/podoplanin, a mucin-type transmembrane glycoprotein that is predominantly expressed by lymphatic endothelium and is regulated by the lymphaticspecific gene Prox1.

            "text": "Tumors of endothelial origin are classified as benign or malignant, that is, angiomas or angiosarcomas. Benign tumors consist of easily recognized vascular channels lined by a monolayer of relatively normal endothelial cells. Malignant tumors may not form well-organized vascular channels, are more cellular, and display cytologic anaplasia. Intermediate forms exist, hence immunohistochemistry, particularly CD31, CD34, and factor VIII-related antigen, is commonly used to more definitively diagnose vascular neoplasms.Differentiation of vascular malformations or proliferations from hemangiomas may be difficult. Hemangiopericytoma is discussed with skin neoplasms (see Vol. 1, Skin and appendages). There are rare reports of non-endothelial tumors, for instance, leiomyosarcoma, malignant melanoma, chondrosarcoma, arising from vessel walls, especially in the aorta or pulmonary artery.The nomenclature of benign vascular tumors or malformations is confusing, and includes hemangioma, hemangioendothelioma, hamartoma, vascular malformation, telangiectasis, and angiokeratoma. Rare variants include angiolipoma, angiofibrolipoma, angioleiomyoma, arteriovenous hemangioma, and papillary endothelial hyperplasia.\u2022 Hemangioma, a benign tumor of endothelial cells, is supposedly a true neoplasm capable of independent growth. Some of the clinically observed \"growth\" of a hemangioma may be due to congestion, hemorrhage, and thrombosis. Hemangiomas may be present at birth or soon after in children and foals, suggesting that they may in fact be nonneoplastic vascular malformations. The disease may begin quite frequently on the conjunctiva or nictitating membrane, producing at first a small papule and a serous conjunctival discharge. The papules ulcerate to form flat, button-like growths of granulation tissue, the eyelids become severely swollen, and the inflammation extends to the tissues of the forehead.Nasal infection is usually accompanied by a mucopurulent discharge containing large numbers of the fungus, and may be bloodstained. The lesions begin as yellow papules or nodules on the nasal mucosa, and these soon break down to form craterous granulating ulcers that bleed easily. The nasal lesions are usually found near the external nares, and they may extend from there on to the muzzle, or they may be found deep in the nasal cavity and in the pharynx. Similar lesions may occur in the nasal sinuses, the larynx, and the bronchi.The pulmonary lesions may be solid granulomatous areas, or they may be liquefied with pus-like contents. When ulcerative lesions are present on the nasal mucosa, there is suppurative regional lymphadenitis. The typical nodules of epizootic lymphangitis and the liquefied foci that form in deep tissues may also be found in the pleura, spleen, liver, testes, tunica vaginalis, and bone marrow.The diagnosis of epizootic lymphangitis depends upon demonstration of the fungus, which is usually present in very large numbers in the contents of the nodules and fresh discharges from ulcers. The parasitic phase of the fungus is yeastlike, gram positive, globose or oval in shape, and 2-3 \u00b5m in diameter. It occurs extracellularly and intracellularly in macrophages. The fluorescent antibody test is an effective means of diagnosis. In histologic sections, the organism is similar to H. capsulatum, consisting of a basophilic nuclear mass and thin capsule that can be demonstrated by stains for polysaccharides.For more information, please visit the companion site: PathologyofDomesticAnimals.com containing factor VIII) are present in at least some of the typical neoplastic endothelial cells.Lymphangiosarcoma (malignant lymphangioendothelioma) is an extremely rare tumor in domestic animals. The tumor is histologically similar to hemangiosarcoma, but the irregular vascular channels contain few red cells; it may be diffusely invasive and metastasize widely. Ultrastructurally, lymphangiosarcoma is distinguished from hemangiosarcoma, at least in cats and humans, by the general lack of a basal lamina, few micropinocytotic vesicles, few intercellular junctions, lack of pericytes, and a discontinuous endothelial cell layer in lymphangiosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry (factor VIII, vimentin, laminin) and lectin histochemistry (RCA-I, PHA-E) may be other useful adjuncts in differentiating the 2 tumors. As well, lymphatic vessels are characterized by the expression of lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor-1 (LYVE-1) and prospero-related homeobox gene-1 (PROX-1). A B",
