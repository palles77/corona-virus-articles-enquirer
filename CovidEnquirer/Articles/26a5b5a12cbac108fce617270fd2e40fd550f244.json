            "text": "Accumulating evidence has indicated that natural killer cells (NK cells) play an important role in immune responses generated in the liver. However, the underlying molecular basis for local immune regulation is poorly understood. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) at a dose of 20 mg/kg body wt. The percentage and absolute number of NK cells in the liver were analysed with flow cytometry. LSECtin knockout mice and LSECtin cDNA plasmids were used for analyze the role of LSECtin in hepatic NK cell regulation in vivo. Here, we show that the C-type lectin LSECtin, a member of the DC-SIGN family, is a novel liver regulator for NK cells. LSECtin could bind to NK cells in a carbohydrate-dependent manner and could regulate the number of hepatic NK cells. In the NK cellmediated acute liver injury model induced with PolyI:C, the exogenous expression of LSECtin accelerated NK cell-induced liver injury, whereas the absence of LSECtin ameliorated this condition. Our results reveal that LSECtin is a novel, liver-specific NK cell regulator that may be a target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases in the liver.",

The recombine LSECtin protein was used in screening human PBMCs to identify the LSECtin binding cells by flow cytometry. Here, we found that LSECtin recognises CD3(\u00c0)CD56(\u00fe) cells. As a C-type lectin, LSECtin exhibits calciumdependent binding of saccharides. LSECtin binds mannose and GlcNAc as well as fucose in a Ca 2\u00fe -dependent manner. Therefore, we sought to determine whether LSECtin binds to NK cells through protein-glycan interaction.

To demonstrate the effect of exogenous LSECtin expression on NK cell-induced liver injury, a gene therapy protocol was used in which full-length LSECtin or a control plasmid was injected into mice. The mice that were administered the LSECtin plasmid before treatment with polyI:C showed a higher disease severity, with increased serum ALT/AST levels ( Fig. 2A) , and more serious liver histological damage was observed (Fig. 2B) . Then, the phenotype of the mouse liver MNCs was analysed. The LSECtin plasmid-treated mice displayed increased numbers of NK (CD3-DX5\u00fe) cells in the liver (Fig. 2C) . Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of liver NK cells against the NK cellsensitive cell line YAC-1 or primary hepatocytes was also significantly enhanced in LSECtin plasmid-treated mice (Fig. 2D) . Moreover, LSECtin plasmid treatment increased the numbers of IFN-gproducing NK cells in liver (Fig. 2E) .

The mechanisms that regulate the adhesion and migration of NK cells to liver in vivo were poorly understood.

Our results showed that LSECtin KO mice displayed normal numbers of CD3 \u00c0 DX5 \u00fe cells in the spleen compared with the WT mice. In contrast, a decrease in CD3 \u00c0 DX5 \u00fe cells (9% in wt mice vs. 5% in KO mice) was found in the liver (Fig. 3A, B) . Next, we observed that polyI:C administration caused a significant increase in liver damage in wild-type mice compared with LSECtin KO mice, with increased serum ALT/AST and more serious histological damage to the liver in the wild-type mice (Fig. 4A, B) . The number of NK cells in the liver was decreased in LSECtin KO mice compared with WT mice (Fig. 4C) . The cytotoxicity of hepatic NK cells against YAC-1 or primary hepatocytes was lower in the polyI:C-treated LSECtin KO mice (Fig. 4D) . We also investigated the in vivo effect of LSECtin in recruitment of NK cells by delivering LSECtinencoding or control plasmid into the LSECtin KO mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail vein injection. In concordance with data from the normal mice, the LSECtin plasmid treated in KO mice exhibited higher number of hepatic NK cells compared to control plasmid treated mice (Fig. 4E) . Combining the results from in vitro and in vivo studies, it is reasonable to conclude that LSECtin is involved in regulating NK cell recruitment in the liver.",

NK cells represent a larger percentage of the lymphoid population in liver than other organs, suggesting that NK cells express some unique function in liver diseases. NK cells play a vital role in limiting viral replication. Recently study showed that the particular populations of the NK cells are associated with the early control and clearance of HCV infection [13] . The specific defect in CD56 (dim) NK cell activation and the reduced capacity to produce anti-viral and Th1-skewing cytokines may play a role in HBV persistence [14] . NK cells are activated during acute HCV regardless of infection outcome [15] . NK cells recruitment and activation is a critical step for NK cell functioning during infection or tumor metastasis. The expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines is crucial to the control of lymphocyte adhesion. LSECs and Kupffer cells play significant roles in the regulation of hepatic NK cells [16] . LSECtin was specifically expressed in LSECs and Kupffer cells in tissue arrays with 44 normal human tissues. Its specific localization and roles in regulation of NK cell give rise to its important function in hepatic immune regulation [8] . Thus, LSECtin might be involved in the mechanisms underlying the interaction between LSECs or Kupffer cells and NK cells.",

NK cells express a wide array of adhesion molecules, including some integrins, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, PSGL-1, and L-selectin [17, 18] . Recirculation of lymphocyte is regulated by differential expression of adhesion molecules under different conditions. Our results show that LSECtin is involved in hepatic NK cell-mediated immunity. However, LSECtin is not the sole element contributing to hepatic NK cell recruitment since DX5\u00fe cells can still be found in the liver in the absence of LSECtin.

            "text": "The liver possesses a strong innate immune system [19, 20] . Hepatic NK cells are critical effectors of the liver innate immune system and mediate a rapid first line of defence against most pathogens and cancer cells [21, 22] . In particular, interaction of LSECtin with the surface glycoproteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Ebola virus has been described, and LSECtin-mediated infection of cells by Ebola virus has been demonstrated [23e25]. Under disease conditions the molecules involved are relatively regulation and result in selective recruitment of NK cells. Our recently study showed that the expression of LSECtin in liver tissue from patients with various liver diseases was different. The expression of LSECtin in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue is lower. The expression of LSECtin in chronic active hepatitis was higher. Some research proved that the NK cells promote chronic infection by limiting CD8 \u00fe T-cell immunity during virus infection [26] . In addition, LSECtin is a novel regulator of T cells and expose a crucial mechanism for hepatic T-cell immune suppression. In this study, we demonstrate that LSECtin is an important regulator for modulating hepatic NK cells and involves the innate immune responses. So LSECtin is not only an activated T cells but also a NK cells modulator in the liver. This hepatic immune regulation mechanism may provide a target for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases or the therapeutic manipulation of tumours in the liver.",
