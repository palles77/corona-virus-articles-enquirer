To understand the structural connectivity of cortical and subcortical circuits in the healthy human brain could thus be of pivotal importance for detecting changes in this circuitry and to start early intervention, to assess the progress of movement rehabilitation, or the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in neuropsychiatry. While conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, or magnetoencephalography are able to provide detailed information about connectivity at the macro level, the sensitivity and specificity these imaging techniques put limits on the amount of detail one can obtain when measuring in vivo connectivity of human basal ganglia and thalamus. In contrast, the multiband diffusion echo planar imaging MRI sequence, which acquires multiple slices of the brain simultaneously, enables high resolution imaging of these brain structures with only short acquisition times at 3-Tesla field strength. Here, we introduce a novel protocol that allows us to generate comprehensive in vivo participant-specific probabilistic patterns and visualizations of the structural connections that exist within basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei. Moreover, we are able to map specific parcellations of these nuclei into sub-territories based on their connectivity with primary motor-, and somatosensory cortex. The detailed subcortical structural connectivity mapping introduced in this work could benefit early intervention and therapy methods for human movement rehabilitation and for treating neuropsychiatric disorders. author/funder.

[2000] suggest that basal ganglia structures operate as part of the recurrent circuits (loops) with the cerebral cortex and form several corticobasal ganglia loops. Previous models of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic-cortex connectivity suggest that parallel pathways play a role in regulating sensorimotor, associative, and limbic information processing [Haber, 2003; Haber and Calzavara, 2009; Cohen and Frank, 2009 ], however, McFarland and Haber [2002] proposed that such parallel connectivity patterns are not one-way loops and the pathway back to cortex has one component that reinforces each cortico-basal ganglia circuit and one component that relays information between circuits.. In general, these basal ganglia connectivity loops are thought to include connections not only with cortex but also within-, and between basal ganglia and other subcortical structures, such as thalamus and superior colliculus (McHaffie et al., 2005) . In addition to reciprocal connections in the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits that connect regions associated with similar cognitive functions (maintaining parallel networks), there are also non-reciprocal connections (integrative networks) linking regions that are associated with different cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits [Haber and Calzavara, 2009 ].",

Researchers have used this approach [e.g. Behrens et al., 2003; Johansen-Berg et al., 2005; Leh et al., 2007] to perform thalamic-, and striatal connectivity-based parcellation to segment brain regions that were not directly detectable by conventional MRI techniques [Klein et al., 2007] . This connectivity-based segmentation of brain structures has also been used for segmenting the basal ganglia and thalamus [Draganski et al., 2008] , however, their automated segmentation failed to capture some of the connections, e.g. those to hippocampus, fusiform gyrus or substantia nigra. Here we use manual segmentation, in combination with highresolution and improved diffusion contrast to perform connection-based segmentation of basal ganglia and thalamus. Specifically, we propose to employ a rapid DWI acquisition method, with short TR and TE, since this strategy is beneficial for reduction in SNR loss due to T 2 decay inherent to the diffusion encoding and acquisition processes in MRI [Ugurbil et al. 2013 , Sotiropoulos et al. 2013 ]. Thus, this approach generates minimal SNR per unit time penalty, at 3T.",

In general, the intrinsic SNR of MR images is elevated at ultra-high magnetic fields [Vaughan et al. 2001] . For DWI, however there could be an SNR advantage at 7T (over 3T) only if TE could be kept under 100 ms [Ugurbil et al. 2013] . Therefore, improved DWI signal could only be obtained if the 7T scanner is equipped with 150 to 300 mT/m maximum gradient strength, which in turn would bring TE values well under 50 ms [Ugurbil et al. 2013 ].

This approach resulted in structural subdivisions of a specified ROI based on the specific pathways originating from that ROI. Seed classification was performed to identify the connectivity pathways between each seed ROI and the rest of the ROIs that were regarded as targets. This process resulted in a version of a seed ROI mask, called resulting mask, which demonstrated the likelihood of connectivity of each voxel in that ROI with the rest of the subcortical and cortical ROIs. The voxel values of the resulting mask showed the number of tracts originating from the seed ROI and reaching the target ROI successfully. Since the total number of tracts that were generated from each seed voxel was 5000, dividing each voxel value in the resulting mask by 5000 gives the relative frequency of connectivity at that spatial location or voxel.",

This may be due to our selective probabilistic thresholding used for STN localization, which is different from previous methods [Lambert et al., 2012] , where STN was localized as one large region containing iron. The STN volume estimated by us (64.1 mm 3 in the case of whole brain coverage) is closer to the STN volume, which is typically used for the deep brain stimulation.

We found CN to be strongly connected to the dorsomedial GPe [Lenglet et al., 2012] and ventromedial GPi, whereas dorsolateral portions of CN were well connected to both SNr and SNc , also see Supplemental Figure 1 ). The medioventral CN was connected to the deep STN [Smith and Parent, 1986; Parent and Smith, 1987] , whereas the the dorsolateral and rostroventral CN had strong projections to Tha. There were also corticostriatal projections from BA 4 and BA 3,1,2 to the dorsoposterior sections of CN [Draganski et al., 2008; Flaherty and Graybiel 1991; Flaherty and Graybiel 1993] .

Pu also connects directly, and indirectly via GPe and STN, to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia i.e. GPi and SNr. We found strong intrastriatal connections that arise from Pu to CN as can be seen in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 2. The straitopallidal connectivity described in [Draganski et al., 2008] implies that the Pu connections occupied mainly the ventrolateral pallidum and the dorsolateral Pu is connected with both pallidum [Francois et al., 1994; Parent et al., 2000; Saleem et al., 2002] and premotor cortical area. However, we found that efferents from Pu to GPe [Lenglet et al., 2012] were primarily located in medial Pu, whereas a few efferents were found from medial, ventral and dorsolateral Pu to GPi. A medio-laterally decreasing gradient of projections from Pu to SN were identified by Lenglet et al. [2012] . We could not find significant connections between Pu and SN as the relative frequencies of connections was found to be very low for this pathway. STN neurons that excite Pu are located in the sensorimotor dorsolateral two-thirds of STN [Smith and Parent, 1986; Parent and Smith, 1987] .

The interconnected neurons of GPe and STN innervate, via axon collaterals, functionally related neurons in GPi [Shink et al. 1996 ] and therefore, populations of neurons within the sensorimotor, cognitive, and limbic territories in GPe are reciprocally connected with populations of neurons in the same functional territories of STN.

The mid-portion of GPi is connected to SN, whereas its rostral portion is divided into a dorsal part connected to CN, and a ventral part connected to STN and Tha [Lenglet et al. 2012 ]. The pallidothalamic projection stems from the ventral anterior/ventral lateral (VA/VL) thalamic nuclei [Parent and Hazrati, 1995; Sidibe et al., 1997] . However, we found that ventral and medial GPi is mainly connected to SNc, whereas a minor portion of the inferior-posterior GPi connected to SNr, STN and Tha also exists. These connectivities are illustrated in Supplemental Figure 4 . [Draganski et al. 2008] found projections from pallidum to sensorimotor, prefrontal, orbitofrontal and premotor cortical areas. In comparison to those results, our study is more specific as connectivity analysis is done separately for GPe and GPi instead of single pallidum region (combined GPe and GPi). We found strong central GPi connections with BA 4 and BA 3,1,2 cortical regions that can be seen in Supplemental Figure 4 .",

These connectivity pathways of SNc and SNr are illustrated in Supplemental Figure 5 and 6, respectively. It can be seen in our results that the lateral and anterior SNr project to CN and Pu. It was found by Lenglet et al. [2012] that projections from SN to GPi are mainly ventral, whereas nigrostriatal fibers project primarily to Pu medially, dorsally and ventrally. We found that the projections from SNr to GPe and GPi are primarily ventral and lateral, whereas the projections from SNc to GPe and GPi are ventral and ipsilateral. It was also demonstrated by Lenglet et al. [2012] that the most anterolateral portion of SN was strongly connected to GPi, GPe and striatum while the posterolateral portion was strongly connected to Tha. It was hypothesized in [Lenglet et al., 2012] that the medial SN, -well connected to GP but not to the striatum -comprises part of the SNc. Our results are consistent with this hypothesis since we find the medial SNc region to be strongly connected to GPe and GPi, but not well connected to Pu. SNr is one of the main projection sites of the STN [Parent and Smith, 1987] and the STN projections to SNc are additional indirect pathways through which signal from cortical regions reaches basal ganglia output structures. SNc-STN and SNr-STN pathways depicted in Figure 5 and 6, respectively, show that medial regions of SNc and SNr are strongly connected with STN.

The limbic GPi is connected with the rostrodorsal part of PF, which projects back to the nucleus accumbens [Gim\u00e9nez-Amaya et al., 1995] . Ventral MD of Tha is STN [Lengelt et al., 2012] . We found similar projections, although the range of relative frequencies of connectivities is between significant and high. Rostral ventral anterior and MD nuclei project to both pallidum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [Draganski et al., 2008] . Ventral lateral Tha projects to pallidum; Pu and motor area; and premotor area [Draganski et al., 2008] . We found that the similar region of Tha has connections with Pu and BA 4 in the high relative frequency range and with GPe in the significant relative frequency range.",

More specifically, motion, eddy-current, susceptibility, main magnetic field inhomogeneity, concomitant fields and any other types of distortions must be precisely corrected in order to ensure improved quantitative processing of the diffusion and structural MRI data. Due to the imperfect distortion correction, distant proximity of certain structures and dense crossing fibers, the relative frequencies of connectivity of some structures were not in the \"high range\" in our work, for example between STN and cortical areas, CN and STN, Pu and STN, SN and cortical areas, SN and Pu, etc. However, specifically optimized T 2 * sequences can be employed for visualizing the STN to make accurate identification and delineation of the nucleus and target the motor portion of the STN. Additionally, the performance of the employed manual segmentation may not be optimal. This factor may limit the detection of high probability connectivity pathways. As connections revealed through diffusion MRI represent the sum total of both afferents and efferents, the inability of determining the polarity of connections may be another limiting aspect of this study.",
