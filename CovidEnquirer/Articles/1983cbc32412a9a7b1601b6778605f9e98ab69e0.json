To determine the genetic underpinnings of multicellularity in the emerging 27 model choanoflagellate S. rosetta, we performed a screen for mutants with defects in 28 multicellular rosette development. In two of the mutants, Jumble and Couscous, single 29 cells failed to develop into orderly rosettes but instead aggregated promiscuously into 30 amorphous clumps of cells. Both mutants mapped to lesions in genes encoding 31 glycosyltransferases and the mutations perturbed glycosylation patterns in the 32 extracellular matrix (ECM). In animals, glycosyltransferases transfer activated sugars to 33 donor molecules and thereby sculpt the polysaccharide-rich ECM, regulate integrin and 34 cadherin activity, and, when disrupted, contribute to tumorigenesis. The finding that 35 glycosyltransferases promote proper rosette development and prevent cell aggregation 36 in S. rosetta suggests a pre-metazoan role for glycosyltransferases in regulating 37 development and preventing abnormal tumor-like multicellularity.",

Against a background of sequence 163 variants that did not segregate perfectly with the Rosetteless phenotype, five unlinked 164 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) were found to 165 perfectly segregate with the phenotype (Table S2 ). Four of these detected sequence 166 variants likely had spurious correlations with the phenotype resulting from relatively low 167 sequencing coverage at those variants (>0.25X coverage of the entire genome) ( Table  168 S2). In contrast, the remaining SNV was detected in a well-assembled portion of the 169 genome at a sequencing depth approaching the average coverage of the entire 170 genome. The perfectly segregating SNV, at position 427,804 on supercontig 8, was 171 identical to the causative mutation identified in Levin et al., 2014 (Table S2) . Thus, a 172 method based on pooling F1 haploid mutants, identifying sequence variants that 173 perfectly segregated with the phenotype, and masking those SNVs/INDELs that were 174 detected with >0.25X coverage of the total genome was effective for correctly 175 pinpointing the causal mutation for Rosetteless (Figure 2-figure supplement 1 Jumble that segregated perfectly with both the clumping and rosette defects.

In a backcross of mutant F1 progeny to the Mapping Strain, we confirmed the tight 202 linkage of the SNV to the rosette defect phenotype ( Figure 2B ). Moreover, all F2 203 progeny that displayed a rosette defect also had a clumping phenotype. Given the tight 204 linkage of both traits with the SNV and the absence of any detectable neighboring 205 sequence variants, we infer that the single point mutation at genome position 206 1:1,919,681 causes both the clumping and rosette defect phenotypes in Jumble 207",

Moreover, in contrast with the structural stability and shear 116 resistance of wild type rosettes (Figure 1A) (Levin et al., 2014), the cell clumps formed 117 by Class C mutants were sensitive to shear and separated into solitary cells upon 118 pipetting or vortexing the culture (Figure 1A). 119 Following exposure to shear, we observed that mutant cells re-aggregated into 120 new clumps within minutes, while wild type cells never formed clumps (Figure 1C, D; 121 rare cell doublets were likely due to recent cell divisions).

In the Levin et al. 2014 study, the 137 Rosetteless mutant was crossed to a phenotypically wild type Mapping Strain 138 (previously called Isolate B in Levin et al., 2014) and relied on genotyping of haploid F1s 139 at 60 PCR-verified genetic markers that differed between the Rosetteless mutant and 140 the Mapping Strain (Levin et al., 2014). The 60 markers were distributed unevenly 141 across the 55 Mb genome and proved to be insufficient for mapping the Class C 142 mutants for this study.

Target acceptors in animals include key signaling and adhesion proteins such as 257 integrins and cadherins, whose activities are regulated by N-and O-linked 258 polysaccharide modifications, also referred to as N-and O-linked glycans (Larsen et al., 259 2017; Zhao et al., 2008). Notably, many well-characterized glycosyltransferases act in 260 the Golgi apparatus, where they glycosylate molecules that are trafficked through the 261 secretory system (El-Battari, 2006; Tu and Banfield, 2010). To investigate the 262 localization of Jumble, we transfected wild type cells with a jumble-mWasabi gene 263 fusion transcribed under the control of the S. rosetta efl promoter. Jumble-mWasabi 264 protein localized to the apical pole of the cell body near the base of the flagellum. Based 265 on comparisons with transmission electron micrographs of S. rosetta and other 266 choanoflagellates, Jumble-mWasabi localization corresponds to the location of the Golgi 267 apparatus, for which there is not yet a fluorescent marker in S. rosetta (Figure 2E,G; 268",

The ER localization of Jumble lw1 is consistent with the hypothesis 272 that the missense mutation disrupts proper protein folding as often misfolded proteins 273 are retained in the ER and targeted for degradation(Kopito, 1997). The failure of the 274 Jumble lw1 protein to localize properly at the Golgi apparatus strongly suggests a loss of 275 function. 276 277Couscous maps to a lesion in a predicted mannosyltransferase 278We followed a similar strategy to map the genetic lesion(s) underlying the 279Couscous mutant phenotype. Using the bulk segregant approach on F1 mutant 280 offspring from a Couscous \u00b4 Mapping Strain cross, we identified eight sequence 281 variants that segregated perfectly with the clumping and rosette defect phenotypes, of 282 which only one -a single nucleotide deletion at position 462,534 on supercontig 22 -283 had sequencing coverage at least 0.25X of the average sequence coverage of the rest 284 of the genome (Figure 3A; Table S4). The tight linkage of the deletion to both the 285 clumping and rosette defect phenotypes was further confirmed by genotyping the 286 sequence variant in F2 mutants resulting from backcrosses of F1 mutants to the 287 Mapping Strain (Figure 3B). Given the tight linkage, we infer that the deletion at position 288 462,534 on supercontig 22 causes both clumping and the disruption of rosette 289 development in Couscous mutant cells. 290 The single nucleotide deletion at position 462,534 on supercontig 22 sits in a 291 four-exon gene, hereafter called couscous (GenBank accession EGD77026/ NCBI 292 ). The mutation causes a predicted frameshift leading to an 293 early stop codon in the mutant protein, Couscous lw1 (Figure 3A). As with the Jumble 294 mutant, we were able to rescue rosette formation in a portion of the population by 295 transfecting cells with either a couscous-mTFP or mTFP-couscous gene fusion under 296 the efl promoter (Figure 3C, D), thereby increasing our confidence in the mapping 297 results. 298 The predicted Couscous amino acid sequence contains a specific type of 299 glycosyltransferase domain, an alpha-mannosyltransferase domain, that transfers 300 activated mannose onto the outer chain of core N-linked polysaccharides and O-linked 301 mannotriose (Strahl-Bolsinger et al., 1999). The predicted mannosyltransferase domain 302 shares 28% and 35% amino acid sequence identity to alpha 1-2 mannosyltransferase 303 (MNN2) proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, respectively, 304 including the conserved DXD motif found in many families of glycosyltransferases 305 (Wiggins and Munro, 1998) (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A).

However, despite attempting to co-transfect cells with couscous-mWasabi and a 320 marker of the ER, we were unable to detect any cells expressing both constructs. In 321 addition, it is possible that the fusion of Couscous to a fluorescent protein or its 322 overexpression interfered with its proper localization in S. rosetta.

To 329 investigate the distribution of cell surface glycans, we stained live S. rosetta with diverse 330 fluorescently labelled sugar-binding lectins.

Jacalin also brightly stained the ECM filling the center of 335 rosettes in a pattern reminiscent of the Rosetteless C-type lectin (Levin et al., 2014) 336 (Figure 4A, B'), although the two were not imaged simultaneously because jacalin does 337 after cell fixation and labelled Rosetteless antibodies accumulate strongly in the 338 food vacuoles of live cells. In contrast with wild type cells, the basal patch of jacalin 339 staining was absent or significantly diminished in Couscous and Jumble mutants, both 340 in the presence and absence of RIFs (Figure 4 C-F). Interestingly, the apical patch of 341 jacalin staining in mutant cells appeared similar to wild type cells. This may explain the 342 lack of a clear difference in bands detected with jacalin by western blot between wild 343 type and mutants whole cell lysates (Figure 4-figure supplement 1). 344 The loss of basal jacalin staining indicated that the Jumble and Couscous 345 mutations either disrupt proper trafficking of sugar-modified molecules to the basal pole 346 of cells or alter the glycosylation events themselves. Thus, we examined whether the 347 basal secretion of Rosetteless protein was disrupted in the mutant strains. In both 348 Jumble and Couscous, Rosetteless properly localized to the basal pole, but its 349 expression did not increase nor was it secreted upon treatment with RIFs, as normally 350 occurs in wild type cells (Figure 4-figure supplement 2).

A 361 recent study revealed that the bacterium Vibrio fischeri induces S. rosetta to form 362 swarms of cells, visually similar to the mutant clumps, as part of their mating behavior 363(Woznica et al., 2017). However, it seems unlikely that the clumping Class C mutants is 364 related to swarming; the cell fusion and subsequent settling of diploid cells characteristic 365 of V. fischeri-induced mating have not been observed in the class C mutants cultured 366 without V. fischeri. 367For both Jumble and Couscous, the causative mutations mapped to predicted 368 glycosyltransferase genes. Consistent with its role as a glycosyltransferase, Jumble 369 localized to the Golgi apparatus, but Couscous appeared to localize in cytoplasmic 370 puncta and to the cell membrane. We predict that the glycosyltransferase mutations are 371 loss of function alleles, given that transfection of mutant S. rosetta with the wild type 372 alleles was sufficient to complement each of the mutations. While we have not 373 uncovered the target(s) of the glycotransferases or the exact nature of the interplay 374 between the two phenotypes, disruption of the glycocalyx at the basal pole of both 375 Jumble and Couscous mutant cells (Figure 4) hints that the regulation of ECM could 376 play a role in preventing clumping and in promoting proper rosette development. 377 One possible explanation for the clumping phenotype is that jumble and 378 couscous are required to regulate the activity of cell surface adhesion molecules and 379 receptors. Glycosylation regulates the activities of two key adhesion proteins in animals: 380 integrins that regulate ECM adhesion, and cadherins that, among their various roles in 381 cell signaling and animal development, bind other cadherins to form cell-cell adhesions 382 called adherens junctions (Larsen et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2008). Cadherin activity can 383 -V) whose activity leads to decreased cell adhesion (Carvalho et al., 2016; 387 Granovsky et al., 2000). GnT-V knockdown enhances cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-388 cadherin and the related N-cadherin (Carvalho et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2009). The 389 inactivation of E-cadherin, including through over-or under-expression of GnT-V or 390 GnT-III, is considered to be a hallmark of epithelial cancers (Hirohashi and Kanai, 391 2003). S. rosetta expresses 29 different cadherins (Nichols et al., 2012) and it is 392 possible that mutations to jumble and couscous disrupt regulatory glycosylation of a cell 393 adhesion molecules like cadherins. 394 Another possibility is that jumble and couscous add a protective sugar layer to 395 the cell surface and loss of glycosyltransferase activity reveals underlying sticky 396 surfaces. If jumble and couscous add branches to existed sugar modifications, their loss 397 of function could expose new sugar moieties at the cell surface that act as ligands for 398 lectins that aggregate cells. Lectins mediate cell aggregation in diverse organisms 399 (Colin Hughes, 1992). For example, sponges such as Geodia cydonium can be 400 disaggregated into single cells and then reaggregated through lectin binding of a post-401 translational sugar modification (M\u00fcller et al., 1979). In S. cerevisiae, the 402 mannosyltransferase MNN2 adds mannose structures to the cell wall that are 403 recognized by aggregating lectins and MNN2 is required for proper flocculation (Rayner 404 and Munro, 1998; Stratford, 1992).

            "text": ". A prior study showed 411 that only S. rosetta cells recognized with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) are 412 competent to form rosettes, which suggests that glycosylation might be necessary for 413 rosette development(Dayel et al., 2011). While WGA staining does not appear to be 414 perturbed in Jumble and Couscous(Table S2), jacalin staining at the basal pole 415 appears severely reduced or abolished compared to wild type. Jacalin staining was 416 enriched in the center of wild type rosettes in a pattern reminiscent of Rosetteless, 417 which is required for rosette development(Levin et al., 2014). Intriguingly, in Jumble 418 and Couscous, Rosetteless localized to the correct pole, but did not become enriched 419 upon rosette induction, indicating that the ECM did not properly mature. Rosetteless has 420 mucin-like Ser/Thr repeats that are predicted sites of heavy glycosylation and two C-421 type lectin domains that would be expected to bind to sugar moieties(Levin et al.,  422   2014). Therefore, it is possible that Rosetteless might be regulated either through direct 423 glycosylation or through the glycosylation of potential binding partners by Jumble and 424Couscous. 425The clumping, rosetteless mutants underscore the differences between cell426 aggregation and a regulated clonal developmental program, such as embryogenesis or 427 rosette development. Aggregation is hypothesized to only be evolutionarily stable if 428 close relatives (Gilbert et al., 2007; Kuzdzal-Fick et al., 2011). Recent efforts 429 to experimentally evolve multicellularity in yeast and the green alga Chlamydomonas 430 reinhardtii have all resulted in isolates that formed clonally and not through aggregation 431 (Herron et al., 2018; Ratcliff et al., 2013, 2012). Although aggregation and clonal 432 multicellularity both rely on cell-cell adhesion and cell signaling, the fact that they are 433 mutually exclusive in S. rosetta and in experimental evolution studies argues against 434 their co-occurrence in the animal stem lineage. 435 436 MATERIALS AND METHODS 437 Media preparation, strains, and cell culture 438 Unenriched artificial seawater (ASW), AK artificial seawater (AK), cereal grass 439 media (CG), and high nutrient (HN) media were prepared as described previously 440 (Booth et al., 2018; Levin et al., 2014; Levin and King, 2013). The wild type strain, from 441 which each mutant was generated, was the described strain SrEpac (ATCC PRA-390; 442 accession number SRX365844) in which S. rosetta is co-cultured monoxenically with 443 the prey bacterium Echinicola pacifica (Levin et al., 2014; Levin and King, 2013; 444 Nedashkovskaya et al., 2006). Seafoam, Soapsuds, and Couscous (previously named 445 Branched) were generated through X-ray mutagenesis and Jumble was generated by 446 EMS mutagenesis as documented in Levin et al., 2014. For routine culturing, wild type 447 and mutant cultures were diluted 1:10 every 2-3 days in HN media. The Mapping Strain, 448 (previously called Isolate B in Levin et al., 2014) used for mapping crosses (accession 449 number SRX363839) was grown in the presence of rosette-inducing A. 450 machipongonensis bacteria (ATCC BAA-2233). The Mapping Strain was maintained in 451 . rosetta, cells were maintained in 5% (vol/vol) HN media in AK seawater (Booth et al., 453 2018). Rosette induction was performed with A. machipongonensis outer membrane 454 vesicles (OMVs) prepared as in Woznica et al., 2016 and referred to here as rosette 455 inducing factors (RIFs). 456 Imaging and quantifying rosette phenotypes 457 To image rosette phenotypes (Figure 1A), cells were plated at a density of 1x10 4 458 cells/ml in 3 ml HN media either with or without Algoriphagus RIFs. Cultures were 459 imaged after 48 hr of rosette induction in 8-well glass bottom dishes (Ibidi 15 \u03bc-Slide 8 460 well Cat. No. 80826) that were coated with 0.1 mg/mL poly-D-lysine (Sigma) for 15 min 461 and washed 3 times with water to remove excess poly-D-lysine. For imaging wild type 462 and mutant cultures in the presence and absence of RIFs (Figure 1A top two panels), 463 200 \u03bcl of cells were plated with a wide bore pipette tip for minimal disruption and 464 allowed to settle for 5 min. For images of vortexed cells (Figure 1A bottom panel), 200 465 \u03bcl of cells were vortexed for 15 s before plating and imaged within 10 min of plating to 466 prevent re-clumping. Cells were imaged live by differential interference contrast 467 microscopy using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1/7 Widefield microscope with a Hammatsu 468 Orca-Flash 4.0 LT CMOS Digital Camera and a 63x/NA1.40 Plan-Apochromatic oil 469 immersion lens with 1.6X optivar setting. 470 To quantify rosette induction (Figure 1B), cells were plated at a density of 1x10 4 471 cells/ml in 3 ml HN media with RIFs. After 48 hr, an aliquot of cells was vortexed 472 vigorously for 15 secs and fixed with formaldehyde. To determine the percentage of 473 cells in rosettes, the relative number of single cells and cells within rosettes were scored 474 hemocytometer. Rosettes were counted as a group of 3 or more cells with 475 organized polarity relative to a central focus after exposure to vortexing. 476 Imaging and quantification of cell clumping 477 Clumps were quantified using a modified protocol from Woznica et al., 2017 478 (Figure 1C). To prevent cells from sticking to the bottom of the glass dishes, 8 well 479 glass bottom dishes (Ibidi 15 \u03bc-Slide 8 well Cat. No. 80826) were coated with 1% BSA 480 for 1 hr and washed 3 times with water to remove any residual BSA. Cells were diluted 481 to 5x10 5 cells/mL, vortexed for 15 s to break apart any pre-formed clumps and plated in 482 the BSA pre-treated dishes. For quantification, DIC images were taken using a Zeiss 483 Axio Observer.Z1/7 Widefield microscope with a Hammatsu Orca-Flash 4.0 LT CMOS 484 Digital Camera and a 20x objective. Images were collected for each strain from 10 485 distinct locations throughout the well. 486 Images were batch processed in ImageJ for consistency. To accurately segment 487 the phase bright cells and limit signal from the phase dark bacteria the following 488 commands were applied with default settings: 'Smooth' (to reduce background bacterial 489 signal), 'Find Edges' (to highlight the phase-bright choanoflagellate cells), 'Despeckle' 490 (to remove noise), 'Make Binary' (to convert to black and white), 'Dilate' (to expand to 491 smooth jagged edges from segmentation), 'Erode' (to return to the same size as before 492 dilate), and 'Fill Holes' (to fill any remaining small holes). Finally, images were analyzed 493 with the 'Analyze Particles' command to calculate the area of the clump and only 494 particles larger than 20 \u03bcm 2 were kept to filter out any remaining bacterial signal. Cell 495 equivalents/clump (Figure 1C, right y axis) were calculated by dividing the area of the 496 clump by the area of a representative individual cell (as approximated by averaging the 497 the wild type cells). Data are presented as violin boxplots, showing the median 498 cell number (middle line), interquartile range (white box), and range excluding outliers 499 (thin line).

Structural homology analysis 644 of Jumble was performed with Phyre2 (Kelly et al., 2015) and HHphred (Zimmermann et 645 al., 2017). The structure of the human N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 4 (GlcNAc T4) 646 catalytic domain (HHphred: E-value 7.5 -19 ) was aligned to the predicted Jumble 647 structure generated by HHphred using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 648 2.0 Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC (Figure 2-figure supplement 2B).

Jumble lw1 was 658 cDNA prepared from the Jumble mutant. Couscous lw1 could not be cloned 659 from cDNA directly (possibly because of low mRNA levels due to nonsense mediate 660 decay or simply because of high GC content of the gene).

The maximum fluorescence 754 intensity pixel of the jacalin channel was determined for the cropped image and was 755 used to normalize the fluorescence intensity. To measure jacalin staining around the 756 cell body, a line was drawn using only the lysotracker staining from the point where the 757 collar and the cell body meet on one side of the cell around the cell to the other and the 758 fluorescence intensity was measured along the line. To compare between cells, the 759 lines drawn around the cell body were one-dimensional interpolated in R to include 150 760 points and normalized to the length of the line. The average fluorescence intensity was 761 plotted over the length of the line drawn around the cell body for Jumble, Couscous, and 762 wild type induced and uninduced with a 95% confidence interval (Figure 4F). 763 Measurements were taken from two biological replicates with at least 59 cells in total 764 from each condition. 765 Wild type and mutant clumping assays 766 Wild type cells transfected with the puromycin resistance gene and mWasabi 767 separated by the P2A self-cleaving peptide under the efl promoter and maintained in 40 768 \u03bcg/mL puromycin to enrich for positive transformants.

As observed in prior studies of S. rosetta mating (Levin et al., 2014; Woznica et 181 al., 2017), the diploid cells each secreted a flask-shaped attachment structure called a 182 theca and were obligately unicellular.

The inability to recover haploids with either clumping or rosette defect 187 phenotypes from the Seafoam\u00b4Mapping Strain and Soapsuds\u00b4Mapping Strain crosses 188 might be explained by any of the following: (1) the clumping/rosette defect phenotypes 189 are polygenic, (2) meiosis defects are associated with the causative mutations, and/or 190 (3) mutant fitness defects allowed wild type progeny to outcompete the mutant progeny. 191 In contrast, heterozygous diploids from crosses of Jumble and Couscous to the 192 Mapping Strain produced F1 haploid progeny with both wild type and mutant 193 phenotypes and thus allowed for the successful mapping of the causative genetic 194 lesions, as detailed below. 195 Jumble maps to a putative glycosyltransferase 197Following the bulk segregant approach, we identified 5 sequence variants in 198",
