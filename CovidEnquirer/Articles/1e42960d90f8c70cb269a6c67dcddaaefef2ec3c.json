Enlargement of the left supraclavicular node, in particular, should suggest a malignant disease (e.g., lymphoma or rhabdomyosarcoma) arising in the abdomen and spreading via the thoracic duct to the left supraclavicular area. Enlargement of the right supraclavicular node indicates intrathoracic lesions because this node drains the superior areas of the lungs and mediastinum. Palpable supraclavicular nodes are an indication for a thorough search for intrathoracic or intraabdominal pathology.",

Viral: Infectious mononucleosis (Epstein\u00c0Barr virus), cytomegalovirus, HIV, hepatitis A, B, C c. Spirochetal: Syphilis, Lyme disease, leptospirosis d.

Fungal: Disseminated candidiasis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, South American blastomycosis Physical Examination 1. Size of spleen (measured in centimeters below costal margin); consistency, tenderness, audible rub. It is critical to differentiate splenoptosis from true enlargement of the spleen. 2. Hepatomegaly. 3. Lymphadenopathy. 4. Fever. 5. Ecchymoses, purpura, petechiae. 6. Stigmata of liver disease, such as jaundice, spider angiomata, or caput medusa. 7. Stigmata of rheumatoid arthritis or SLE. 8. Cardiac murmurs, Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, splinter hemorrhages, fundal hemorrhages as evidence of SBE.",
