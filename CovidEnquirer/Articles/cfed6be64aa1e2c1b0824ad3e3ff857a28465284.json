            "text": "In the past two decades there has been a growing realisation that the livestock sector was in a process of change, resulting from an expansion of intensive animal production systems and trade to meet a globalised world's increasing demand for livestock products. One unintended consequence has been the emergence and spread of transboundary animal diseases and, more specifi cally, the resurgence and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Concurrent with changes in the livestock sector, contact with wildlife has increased. This development has increased the risk of transmission of infections from wildlife to human beings and livestock. Two overarching questions arise with respect to the real and perceived threat from emerging infectious diseases: why are these problems arising with increasing frequency, and how should we manage and control them? A clear conceptual research framework can provide a guide to ensure a research strategy that coherently links to the overarching goals of policy makers. We propose such a new framework in support of a research and policy-generation strategy to help to address the challenges posed by emerging zoonoses.",

            "text": "New infectious diseases emerge because of a complex set of multifactorial circumstances that include population growth, changes in nutritional, agricultural, and trade practices, and shifts in land use including accelerated urbanisation, deforestation, and encroachment on wildlife. [2] [3] [4] [5] Additionally, ancient zoonotic diseases such as rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, zoonotic trypanosomiasis, and disorders associated with tapeworm infections are re-emerging because of a combination of similar factors, including transmission of pathogens from wildlife to domestic reservoir species. 3, 6, 7 Increased complexity in food chains and diff erent systems of food production and preparation are also leading to rising importance of food-borne zoonoses such as salmonella, campylobacter, and Escherichia coli infections, which are all linked to livestock production and processing systems. 8 How climate change will aff ect this complex dynamic mix of factors is unclear, but it is expected to aff ect the range, distribution, and diversity of pathogens, and possibly the associated morbidity. 9, 10 Two overarching questions arise from these observations. Why are these problems arising with increasing frequency? 11 And how should we be riskmanaging and controlling them? We outline some of the important changes in livestock systems and their eff ect on infectious diseases and describe a conceptual framework for a systematic approach to guide so-called one-health research and to aid policy formulation. We use the term one-health to denote the collaborative eff ort of many disciplines-working locally, nationally, and globally-to attain optimum health of human beings, animals, and our environment. 12 Background During the 1990s, there was a growing realisation that the livestock sector was undergoing a so-called livestock revolution. 13 This event was probably the second major livestock revolution, the fi rst occurring during the 19th century as European populations grew and became increasingly urbanised. The fi rst revolution largely aff ected ruminants and caused various livestock disease problems that were, especially in developed countries, controlled through creation of veterinary services, investment in research, and education systems. 8 The benefi ts from these investments were felt in the control of several livestock diseases and in human health. 14, 15 There were also advances in livestock production methods and marketing systems that helped to feed a growing urban population. However, this fi rst revolution also created major zoonotic problems, such as bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, that were left unattended for decades. By the time they were controlled in livestock populations, these diseases had caused large-scale human morbidity and mortality. [16] [17] [18] The second livestock revolution that probably began in the 1980s originated from the rapid expansion of intensive pig and poultry production systems and, to some extent, from a growth in milk production. It was facilitated by the availability of antimicrobial and antiparasitic treatments used for preventive purposes to allow high densities of animals to be kept under suboptimum husbandry conditions. Research into pig and poultry production systems has changed breeding, feeding, and management systems, leading to improvements in overall productivity and standardisation of products. These profound changes in livestock production have been broadly welcomed because they have met the Personal View growing demand for livestock products. Initially, there were some concerns about poor livestock producers being left behind, [19] [20] [21] [22] and the potential negative eff ects on the environment. 23, 24 What was less expected were the increased problems associated with control of animal diseases that cross international borders and the resurgence, and in some cases emergence, of zoonotic diseases. Additionally, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has led to demands to reduce or to avoid the use of antimicrobial preventive treatment in animal production. 25 The second livestock revolution has been concurrent with increased contact between wildlife and both livestock and people. This change has resulted from increased settlement or farming in wildlife habitats, wildlife farming, increasing diversity of animals kept as pets, and the increase of tourism in remote areas. 3, 5 Increased contact has heightened the risk of transmission of infections from wildlife to human beings and livestock. Reviews suggest that many emerging human pathogens have originated from wildlife, and that livestock intensifi cation probably exacerbates the emergence of zoonotic diseases by amplifi cation, irrespective of whether the infection source is livestock or wildlife. 11, 26 Throughout human history, populations everywhere have encountered new and resurgent communicable diseases. 27 But, despite this history, human beings have at times been optimistic in their perceptions. Famously, in 1948, US Secretary of State George Marshall proclaimed that the conquest of all infectious diseases was imminent. 28 It has been widely said that, in 1969, US Surgeon General William H Stewart expressed his confi dence that we had reached the frontiers of communicable diseases; although this is now dismissed as urban myth, other notable examples exist from the 1960s and 1970s of world leaders in the fi eld proclaiming that infectious diseases had been conquered. 29 Since then, the number and novelty of crises associated with communicable diseases have surprised researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. And the global reach and speed of spread has challenged public health systems in ways unimagined.",

Indeed, the outbreak was classifi ed as a national disaster, thus falling under the authority of the National Disaster Preparedness and Response Unit, which involved several government departments and reported directly to the Prime Minister.

            "text": "Although the framework that we set out links coherently research themes that might support public health, the framework does not address policy timelines, the sometimes urgent need for evidence, issues of the feasibility of research, nor the receptivity of audiences and the willingness of research evidence to be acknowledged and embedded within policy-making processes. Such a framework does not nor can it hope to guide priority setting, nor national, regional, and global agendas for research. Other information should guide priority setting and research agendas, including timeline for results, risk of research programme failure, probable public health benefi ts in the short and long term, and likely benefi ciaries. However, we believe that this framework off ers a structure around which these issues can be discussed and from which a coherent research agenda might emerge.",
