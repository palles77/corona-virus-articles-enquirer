Diarrhoea, bloat, scours, mucoid enteritis, enterotoxaemia, gut stasis, woolblock, trichobezoars, enteritis, gastroenteropathy, mucoid enteropathy are among the variety of non-specific terms used to describe the diseases that affect the gastrointestinal tract. Many of the digestive disorders that afflict pet rabbits are related to diet and only a few are caused by enteric pathogens. There is a complex inter-relationship between the predisposing factors and causes of digestive disease. This inter-relationship is summarized in Figure 10 .1. Enteric disease is manifested by a disruption in normal faecal production. The consistency and frequency of hard and/or soft faeces are altered. There may or may not be mucus production. The term 'diarrhoea' can be confusing, both to owners and vets. A list of differential diagnoses of 'diarrhoea' is given in Table 10 .1.",

Briefly, the rabbit is a strict herbivore whose digestive system is adapted for the ingestion of a fibrous diet. Digestion in the stomach and small intestine is similar to monogastric animals and food that reaches the hindgut is mainly composed of fibre that cannot be broken down by the digestive enzymes of the stomach and small intestine. The rabbit has the ability to separate large fibre particles from small fibre particles in the proximal colon. The small particles and the large undigested particles are simultaneously sent in opposite directions. Large particles of undigested fibre pass distally and are excreted in hard faecal pellets. Small fibre particles are sent in a retrograde direction into the caecum where they undergo bacterial fermentation. Bacterial fermentation within the caecum releases volatile fatty acids that are absorbed as an energy source. The result of bacterial fermentation within the caecum is a fine paste containing amino acids, vitamins, enzymes, microorganisms and volatile fatty acids.",

For most of the day, it mixes and separates ingesta, simultaneously sending indigestible particles towards the anus, and fermentable particles towards the caecum. Periodically, the motility of the proximal colon alters completely, and pasty caecal contents are directed along the colon to be expelled as soft faecal pellets or caecotrophs. Caecotroph production follows a diurnal rhythm. Most rabbits produce soft faeces during the morning and evening approximately 4 h after feeding. These caecotrophs are re-ingested directly from the anus to be digested in the stomach and small intestine as an additional source of nutrients for the rabbit. The nature of the intestinal contents, muscular activity, transit time and exchange of water and electrolytes alter according to the type of faeces that are passing through the colon. Therefore, digestion and colonic motility can either be in the 'hard faeces phase' or the 'soft faeces phase' (see Figure 1 .2). The amount of ingesta and gas in the various sections of the digestive tract alters according to the phase of excretion. The size and shape of the caecum also follows a diurnal rhythm, which is an important consideration during abdominal palpation or radiography of rabbits.",

            "text": "Separation of ingesta in the proximal colon is accomplished by a combination of Digestive disorders functional anatomy and colonic motility. Sacculations in the wall of the proximal colon (haustra) retain small particles while the larger particles accumulate in the lumen. Haustral activity directs small particles towards the caecum, while segmental activity directs large particles towards the anus. Lagomorphs have a specially adapted muscular segment of the colon known as the fusus coli that contains a large number of mucus glands (see Plate 22). The fusus coli acts as pacemaker for colonic motility. It is highly innervated and vascular and is not only controlled by the autonomic nervous system but is also subject to the effects of metabolites and hormones such as aldosterone and prostaglandins. During the excretion of caecotrophs, haustral activity ceases and caecal material is moved swiftly along the large colon. In the fusus coli, the material is formed into pellets that become encapsulated in mucus (see Plate 22). The transit time for soft faeces through the colon is 1.5-2.5 timeS faster than for hard faeces (Fioramonti and Ruckesbusch, 1976) . Within the caecum lies a complex ecosystem of microflora nourished by water and digesta that arrive from the small intestine via the proximal colon. Water is secreted into the proximal colon during the process of mixing and separating and is sent into the caecum with the small particles. Water is absorbed from the caecum across the caecal wall into the circulation. The retention time of digesta within the caecum is affected by both caecocolonic motility and the nature of ingesta that reaches it. Conditions within the caecum are affected by the type and amount of nutrients that supply the microflora and the products of bacterial fermentation. The balance of microorganisms in the caecum is of paramount importance to the health of the animal. A healthy microflora digests food efficiently. Any factor that upsets the balance of caecal microflora has the potential to result in the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria and cause disease.",

Rabbits produce two types of droppings, i.e. hard faeces and caecotrophs. Normal caecotrophs are soft in consistency and are often mistaken for diarrhoea. The nature and frequency of both types of faeces are an important consideration. In some conditions, there is also excessive mucus production that can be mistaken for diarrhoea. Figure 10 .2 illustrates the topographical relationship of the liver, spleen, pancreas, small intestine and colon at three levels from superficial (ventral) to deep (dorsal). The diagrams were drawn from fresh dissections after removal of the caecum. Each of the three drawings shows the small intestine in green and the large intestine in black.

Bacteroides spp. predominate in a microflora composed of aerobic and anaerobic grampositive and gram-negative rods, cocci, filaments, coccobacilli and spirochaetes. In addition to the aerobic flora, over 74 strains of anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the caecal mucosa and many of these species have not been cultivated (Straw, 1988) . The microbial flora can contain small numbers of potential pathogens such as Clostridium spp. Stress has an effect on caecal microflora. Increased glucocorticoid levels increase coliform counts and narrow the aerobic to anaerobic bacteria ratio in the gut (Straw, 1988) . Changes in the caecal microflora can be seen in gram-stained smears of caecal contents. In the healthy rabbits, high numbers of large anaerobic metachromatic bacteria (LAMB) and protozoa are present. In rabbits suffering from mucoid enteropathy, a drop in the number of LAMB and protozoa and an increase in coliforms are found (Lelkes and Chang, 1987) . The caecal microflora synthesize volatile fatty acids that are absorbed across the caecal wall into the circulation. Anaerobic Bacteroides are the principal source of butyrate that is used as an energy source for the caecal epithelium. The caecal epithelium is adapted for the efficient absorption of water and electrolytes. Butyrate is also important in the regulation of caecal pH, which has an optimim of 5.7-6.1. Changes in caecal pH alter the caecal microflora and can result in the proliferation of pathogens. The proportions of volatile fatty acids in the caecum influences appetite and gut motility. In healthy rabbits, acetates predominate, followed by butyrates and proprionates. Low fibre diets result in decreased acetates and increased proprionates and butyrates. An increase in caecal butyrate inhibits normal peristalsis of the gut (Lang, 1981) .",

In wild rabbits and those pet rabbits that eat a natural diet of grass and hay, a healthy gut flora becomes established that is resilient to any minor dietary changes that occur as the result of eating novel foods. In contrast, in intensive situations where large numbers of rabbits are kept in a small space and fed on artificial diets containing products that rabbits would not normally eat, alterations in the intestinal microflora can rapidly result in the proliferation of pathogens and the development of enteritis. Large numbers of pathogenic bacteria are most likely to be present in intensive situations. Commercial rabbits are young, growing animals, in which a healthy caecal microflora has not become established. Because of the financial importance of losses due to enteric disease in commercial units, extensive research has been carried out into the effects of varying dietary protein, carbohydrate and fibre levels on caecal microflora and volatile fatty acid production. These considerations are beyond the remit of this book, which is mainly concerned with the individual pet rabbit and not commercial rabbit production. The nutrition of the commercial rabbit is described in detail by P.R. Cheeke (Rabbit Feeding and Nutrition, 1987, Academic Press, Orlando) and reviewed in The Nutrition of the Rabbit (eds C.

            "text": "It is not possible to consider any digestive problem in rabbits without examining the diet. The role of fibre and its 'digestibility' or 'indigestibility' is an important concept in the understanding of digestive disease in rabbits. Fibre digestion depends upon the presence of cellulolytic bacteria within the digestive tract. In rabbits the term 'digestibility' includes bacterial degradation or fermentation within the caecum, and not just digestion in the stomach and small intestine. For this reason, the term 'fermentable fibre' may be less confusing than 'digestible fibre'. Bacterial fermentation of fibre within the caecum varies according to the chemical structure and particle size (see Figure  2 .2). For example, hemicellulose is more digestible than lignin. Small particles enter the caecum where their digestibility is affected by their size. Smaller particles of fermentable fibre have a relatively greater surface area for bacteria to adhere to and are digested more quickly than the larger particles. Very large particles (> 0.5 mm) do not enter the caecum and are expelled, undigested, in the hard faeces. Although it has no nutritive value, indigestable fibre is an essential part of the diet because it stimulates gut motility, which sends nutrients and fluids into the caecum for bacterial fermentation. Insufficient indigestible fibre results in slow gut motility and retention of hair and ingesta in the stomach. Reduced motility in the proximal colon affects the separation of intestinal contents and reduces the supply of digesta and fluid to the caecum. Lack of both fermentable and indigestible fibre results in changes in caecal pH, volatile fatty acid distribution and the balance of microbial flora. Alterations in the populations of microorganisms can allow enteric pathogens to proliferate. Therefore, although a low level of dietary fibre may not actually cause disease, it is a major predisposing factor. Additional factors such as coccidiosis or treatment with ampicillin are needed to cause pathological disease in commercial rabbits fed on a low fibre diet (Licois and Mongin, 1980) . The caecal appendix is larger in rabbits on a low fibre diet suggesting either an increased demand for the buffering effects of bicarbonate or an increase in lymphoid activity in response to greater production of bacterial toxins (Cheeke et al., 1986) .",

The high pH of suckling rabbits not only permits healthy bacteria to pass through the digestive tract and colonize the hindgut, but also permits the passage of pathogens, such as pathogenic strains of E. coli. Susceptibility to pathogenic strains of E. coli varies with age; rabbits of 3 weeks are more susceptible than rabbits of 6 weeks of age (Licois et al., 1992) . Weaning is a stressful period for rabbits when healthy caecal microflora is not yet established and juvenile rabbits are susceptible to disease.

Disturbances in water, electrolyte and acid-base balance have a rapid and profound effect on health. Water and electrolytes are continually exchanged along the digestive tract and, in rabbits, any condition that affects this cycle of secretion and absorption also affects fluid and electrolyte balance (see Figure 1 .2). Saliva is constantly produced by rabbits and, during the hard faeces phase, water is secreted into the stomach and proximal colon. It is then reabsorbed from the caecum and distal colon. Dehydration develops rapidly during intestinal disease, despite no obvious fluid loss in vomit or diarrhoea. Conditions that cause intestinal obstruction result in the accumulation of large amounts of fluid proximal to the site of obstruction. Conversely, gastrointestinal hypomotility reduces the secretion of water into the stomach and results in impaction of the contents. Dehydration is associated with gastrointestinal hypomotility, presumably due to decreased absorption of water from the stomach, caecum and distal colon.",

            "text": "required to prevent excessive amounts of hair being swallowed and becoming impacted in the stomach. Some breeders still recommend one day a week without food for rabbits in order to 'clear the system' of ingested hair. Boredom, magnesium or copper deficiency, inadequate protein, individual caging and the presence of air filtration barriers have all been put forward as potential causes of trichobezoar formation (Ojerio and Ladiges, 1981) . The rabbit's inability to vomit has also been cited as a contributory factor (Gillett et al., 1983) . Treatment was usually unsuccessful. The administration of liquid paraffin to lubricate the gastric contents or pineapple juice to dissolve the hair enzymatically with bromelain were suggested as therapies. Surgical removal of the trichobezoar was a last resort and carried a poor prognosis. The association between trichobezoars and fatty liver was noted by many authors (Ojerio and Ladiges, 1981; Gillett et al., 1983 ). An association with pregnancy toxaemia was made by Patton et al. (1983) . It is only in recent years that trichobezoars have been recognized as the result of anorexia rather than the cause. On postmortem examination, the rabbit's stomach is never found to be empty (Okerman, 1988) and the presence of a small amount of fibrous food is normal. The presence of hair entan-gled in the food is also a normal finding because rabbits are continually grooming and ingesting large amounts of hair. In 1984, Leary et al. attempted to induce the clinical syndrome associated with the presence of trichobezoars by the orogastric infusion of latex to reproduce a gastric foreign body. Monthly radiographs were taken and the rabbits monitored closely for food intake and faecal output for 24 weeks after infusion. Gastrotomies were then performed to remove the foreign material and the rabbits monitored closely for a further 4 weeks prior to euthanasia and post-mortem examination. The presence of a latex bezoar did not have any adverse effect on appetite and weight gain of any of the 12 rabbits that were infused. In the same study, the stomach contents of 208 clinically healthy commercial rabbits were examined after slaughter and well-defined trichobezoars were found in 23% of them. This study cast doubt on the concept that trichobezoars cause anorexia. In 1986, Fekete and Bokori found elevated cortisol levels in rabbits with trichobezoars, although they concluded that the elevation was associated with the stress of having a trichobezoar rather than the trichobezoar being the result of stress. In 1987, Buckwell described the successful medical treatment of 'gut stasis' in rabbits exhibiting anorexia, reduced water intake, depression, weight loss and absence of faecal pellets. He described the presence of a palpable impacted mass in the region of the stomach. Treatment consisted of the administration of a motility stimulant, corticosteroid, oral fluid and the provision of hay. Since that time, trichobezoars have increasingly become recognized as the result, rather than the cause, of reduced gastrointestinal motility and are secondary to many other conditions. Pain, stress and fright can all reduce gastrointestinal motility and lead to the accumulation of hair in the stomach and the formation of trichobezoars. In one study by Jackson (1991) , intestinal stasis occurred more frequently in a group of laboratory rabbits that were restrained without the use of a towel. Once towel wrapping was introduced for the restraint of all rabbits, the incidence of the trichobezoars fell dramatically and the author concluded that stress played a significant role in the cause of the disease. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system causes adrenal hormones to be released into the circulation. One of the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline is the inhibition of gastrointestinal motility. If gastrointestinal motility is reduced, water secretion into the stomach is also reduced and hair and ingesta accumulate and become impacted. The rabbit appears to be particularly susceptible to the effects of catecholamines on gut motility. In 260 Textbook of Rabbit Medicine Figure is an oblique view of a 3-year-old, obese female rabbit with gastrointestinal hypomotility. Gas shadows are evident in the stagnant caecum and stomach. The stomach contains a mass of impacted food and hair that has resulted from a decrease in gastrointestinal motility (see Section 10.3.1). The initiating cause was unknown, the rabbit was presented in a moribund state and subsequently died. Postmortem examination confirmed the presence of hepatic lipidosis. There was also fatty degeneration of the kidneys.",

Volatile fatty acid absorption from the gut varies with the hard or soft phase of faecal excretion (Vernay, 1987) and is affected by gut motility.

The resultant drop in glucose and glucogenic volatile fatty acid absorption results in hypoglycaemia that stimulates lipolysis and the mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. The free fatty acids are transported to the liver to be metabolized as an energy source. The major pathway for their degradation is that of \u2424oxidation and ketone body production. Ketoacidosis occurs when ketone body production exceeds tissue metabolism. Rabbits do not have effective metabolic pathways for correcting acidosis (see Section 1.6.5) and are particularly susceptible to the effects of ketoacidosis. Also, during periods of increased mobilization of free fatty acids, a 'bottleneck' develops in the liver, which impairs the metabolic pathways that result in lipid transport to other tissues. Fat accumulates in the hepatocytes causing cholestasis and eventual liver failure and death. Hepatic lipidosis occurs most readily in obese rabbits because they have already accumulated triglycerides in the hepatocytes.",

Stress alone alters the fat metabolism of rabbits, especially in those that are already overweight. In a study by Lafontan and Agid (1979) , minor stressful stimuli such as saline injections or venepuncture induced a prompt increase in plasma free fatty acid and glycerol concentrations in naturally obese rabbits. This increase did not occur in younger, lighter rabbits. Alphaadrenergic responsiveness is increased in the large fat cells of obese rabbits in comparison with the small fat cells of underfed rabbits (Lafontan, 1981) . High fat diets greatly increase the risk of hepatic lipidosis. In a study by Jean-Blain and Durix (1985) , rabbits that were fed on a high fat diet showed a twofold increase in ketonaemia during a period of fasting and were more hypoglycaemic than rabbits that were fed on a low fat diet. Obesity is a major problem in pet rabbits and animals that already have fatty livers can rapidly develop hepatic lipidosis if they become anorexic. Any surgical procedure in an obese rabbit carries a risk of hepatic lipidosis associated with pain, stress and withholding food.",

Healthy pregnant rabbits show a period of insulin resistance between days 24 and 30 of gestation during which high levels of insulin do not stimulate muscle glucose uptake (McLaughlin and Fish, 1994) . Hepatic uptake of glucose and free fatty acids is also reduced in pregnant rabbits and brings about an arterial hyperglycaemia so more glucose is available to the uterus (Pere et al., 1992) .

Enrofloxacin, trimethoprim preparations or metronidazole are the least likely to cause disturbances in the gut flora. Metronidazole has been cited as a treatment of choice for enterotoxaemia caused by Clostridium spiriforme (Carman, 1994) . Trimethoprim combinations can be used to treat coccidiosis \u2022 Some rabbits may be malnourished due to poor diet or dental disease and the inclusion of a vitamin supplement in the treatment protocol can be beneficial. Although rabbits synthesize vitamin C, there is evidence that vitamin C requirements of rabbits increase during periods of stress when plasma ascorbic acid has been shown to decrease significantly (Verde and Piquer, 1986) \u2022 Anabolic steroids can be effective as an appetite stimulant for rabbits and have some beneficial effect in the retention of electrolytes. There appear to be no adverse effects at low doses \u2022 A probiotic can be used to introduce beneficial bacteria to the hindgut. There are many anecdotal reports of the efficacy of commercial probiotic preparations although they contain lactobacillus that is not a normal inhabitant of the rabbit gut.

Cholestyramine (Questran), an ion exchange resin, can be given to absorb enterotoxins. encouraged to eat. Hepatic lipidosis can develop in any rabbit that becomes anorexic, although the risk is greater in obese, pregnant or lactating animals. Tempting foods such as fresh grass, dandelions and appetizing vegetables such as curly kale, spring greens, carrots and apples should be offered. Good quality hay is important, both to stimulate appetite and to provide a sense of security to reduce stress levels. A bed of hay smells familiar. Grass and hay provide long particles of indigestible fibre that are important to stimulate gut motility. A quiet environment away from predators and barking dogs is important. In the initial stages (less than 24 h), analgesia and the provision of palatable fibre can be sufficient to stimulate gut motility and prevent progression of the disease. In the later stages (more than 24 h without food), syringe feeding is required to provide calories and fluid to soften and lubricate impacted stomach contents and provide water and electrolytes. Pureed vegetables or baby foods provide an easily assimilated digestible energy source that can be given through a syringe. A source of fermentable fibre is important to provide nutrients for caecal bacteria. Indigestible fibre cannot be administered through a syringe because the large particles clog the nozzle. There is no point in attempting to grind indigestible fibre down for syringe feeding in an attempt to stimulate gut motility. Grinding fibre to a particle size where it no longer clogs a syringe means that the particles are small enough to be moved into the caecum instead of the colon and the stimulatory action on the gut is lost. Nasogastric tube feeding may be necessary as a last resort for intractable cases, but nasogastric tubes can be counterproductive. They clog up easily and an Elizabethan collar is required. Elizabethan collars have been proven to be stressful to rabbits (Knudtzon, 1988) . Pineapple juice or proteolytic enzymes have been recommended as remedies for hairballs because they are reputed to dissolve hair. Gillett et al. (1983) conducted an experiment in which they incubated rabbit hair for up to 3 days either in papaya, proteolytic enzymes or pineapple juice. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 2 with hydrochloric acid to mimic conditions in the rabbit stomach. They found no difference between the treated and untreated control samples and the authors concluded that none of the enzyme treatments exhibited any ability to dissolve hair. The success of pineapple juice as a remedy for gastric stasis might be due to the introduction of liquid into the stomach that softens the hairball and aids its passage out of the stomach. Liquid paraffin can be used to soften and lubricate impacted stomach contents.",

In a survey of 1000 post-mortem examinations by Hinton (1980) , 7.3% were found to have ulceration of the gastric mucosa. The majority of the ulcers were found in the fundic area of the stomach and did not exhibit significant tissue reaction suggesting that the lesions had developed rapidly and were associated with the stress of the associated illness. In 2% of the rabbits, the ulcers were in the pyloric area and the majority of these had perforated the mucosa. Many of the pyloric ulcers were found in female rabbits that had died in the perinatal period. Experimental stress ulcers can be induced in the gastric mucosa of laboratory rabbits by administering intraperitoneal injections of adrenaline (Behara et al., 1980) .",

There are no specific clinical signs associated with gastric ulceration and inappetant rabbits are often already in pain from other causes. Anthropomorphically, it seems likely that gastric ulceration would add to the pain that is already being experienced. The clinical role of anti-ulcer preparations in the treatment of anorexic rabbits has not been evaluated but the possibility of gastric ulceration is a consideration when treating anorexic rabbits, especially when non-steroidal preparations have been administered. Several human preparations may be of use. Rabbits secrete high levels of gastric acid and pepsin in comparison with dogs, cats, rats and guinea pigs and the effects of anti-ulcer medications on gastric pH have been investigated (Redfern et al., 1991) . Although omeprazole (Losec, Astra) is theoretically more effective than ranitidene (Zantac, GlaxoWellcome) in decreasing acid secretion and increasing postprandial pH, both preparations have a significant effect and appear safe as an adjunct to treatment of anorexia. Omeprazole is only available in capsule form for humans, which makes it difficult to administer a small dose to rabbits. Ranitidene is available as an oral syrup.",

            "text": "In pet rabbits, gastric dilatation is caused by some type of gastrointestinal obstruction. Rabbits continually secrete saliva and cannot vomit so fluid collects in the stomach, which distends rapidly with fluid if ingesta cannot pass through and down the digestive tract. Gas is produced which causes further distension. The stomach and intestine proximal to the obstruction becomes dilated with fluid and gas, giving a typical radiological picture (see Figure 10 .5). Typical foreign bodies include pellets of impacted 'felts' of hair, whole dried pulses, pieces of carpet fibre or other small objects. The small intestine is the usual site of obstruction although pyloric obstructions can occur. Rabbits normally ingest large amounts of hair during grooming, which passes through the digestive tract with no problem. It is felts of impacted, matted hair that cause obstructions. During moulting, large felts of hair can accumulate, especially on the plantar aspect of the 268 Textbook of Rabbit Medicine Key points 10.2 \u2022 For many years, the presence of impacted food material and hair within the stomach was believed to be a cause of anorexia and weight loss. Now, it is recognized that gastrointestinal hypomotility is the cause of impacted stomach contents (trichobezoars or 'hairballs') and anorexia and weight loss are the result \u2022 Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system inhibits intestinal motility. Gastrointestinal hypomotility is associated with any stressful situation or condition that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system including pain, surgery, stress or fright \u2022 A diet high in indigestible fibre stimulates gut motility and reduces the risk of gastrointestinal hypomotility \u2022 Gastrointestinal hypomotility results in gas formation in stagnant organs such as the stomach or caecum. Gas distension of the viscera is painful and abdominal pain stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and compounds the situation \u2022 Gastrointestinal hypomotility results in anorexia and a fall in glucose absorption from the stomach and small intestine. Volatile fatty acid production from the caecum is also reduced \u2022 Hypoglycaemia stimulates lipolysis and mobilization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. Free fatty acids are metabolized as an energy source. Oxidation of free fatty acids releases ketone bodies that can cause ketoacidosis \u2022 Accumulation of free fatty acids in the liver results in the development of hepatic lipidosis. Fatty infiltration of other organs, such as the kidney, occurs and, ultimately, liver and kidney failure result in death of the rabbit \u2022 Obese rabbits that already have a fatty liver are especially prone to the development of hepatic lipidosis \u2022 Increased glucose demand during pregnancy and lactation increases susceptibility to hepatic lipidosis during periods of anorexia \u2022 Stimulating gut motility and maintaining a positive energy balance to prevent oxidation of fatty acids, ketoacidosis and hepatic lipidosis are essential parts of the treatment protocol for many digestive disorders in rabbits \u2022 Gastric ulceration is a common postmortem finding in anorexic rabbits. Anti-ulcer treatment, such as ranitidine, can be used in rabbits. The radiograph shows a grossly distended stomach containing fluid and gas. There is gas distension of the small intestine proximal to the site of obstruction that was in the ileum. This is a characteristic radiograph. The foreign body was surgically removed promptly (see Section 10.5.1) and the rabbit made an uneventful recovery. A differential diagnosis of intestinal obstruction is mucoid enteropathy, in which gastric dilatation may be seen in the terminal stages. An impacted caecum that can be palpated or seen radiographically is generally associated with mucoid enteropathy (see Figure 10 .9). Figure 10 .5b. Dorsoventral view of a rabbit with an intestinal obstruction. Figure 10 .4 shows the same rabbit as Figure 10 .5. Knowledge of the topographical anatomy of the intestines aids diagnosis and location of a foreign body (see Figure 10 .2). The radiographs in Figures 10.5a and 10 .5b were taken after sedating the rabbit with 0.2 mls/kg fentanyl/fluanisone (see Box 5.5). It is possible to obtain a diagnostic radiograph by placing a conscious rabbit in ventral recumbency on an X-ray plate although positioning will be poor because the hind legs cannot be extended. Hypnosis and non-manual restraint with sandbags can be used to obtain a lateral view. A quiet room, gentle handling and patience are needed. The rabbit can be kept calm by covering its head with a towel. metatarsus, and can be ingested by the rabbit during grooming. These felts of hair are found more frequently on Angora rabbits and fluffy Dwarf lops, although any breed can be affected. Rabbits with dental problems appear to be especially prone to intestinal obstruction. Rabbits with incisor problems cannot pull hair out effectively and large mats can build up before the rabbit can remove them. Owners of rabbits with grooming difficulties should be advised to watch for these felts and remove them promptly. Dried pulses such as locust bean seeds or dried peas or sweet corn can also be exactly the right diameter to occlude the small intestine. This type of ingredient should not be included in rabbit food. Again, rabbits with dental problems appear to be prone to swallowing such ingredients whole (Harcourt-Brown and Friggens, 1999) .",

Extramural lesions such as tumours, adhesions, abscesses and tapeworm cysts in the omentum can cause an obstruction (see Plate 36). A cystic calculus has been reported as a cause of intestinal blockage (Talbot and Ireton, 1975) . The severity of symptoms and the course of the disease are related to the site of the obstruction. Complete occlusion of the small intestine is rapid in onset and fatal unless the obstruction is removed promptly. Sometimes the foreign body can move through the small intestine, intermittently obstructing the intestine causing abdominal pain and anorexia that passes off when the object passes through into the colon. The progress of the obstruction can be monitored radiographically from the gas shadows in the small intestine. The ileocaecal valve is a potential site of intestinal obstruction. Intestinal lymphoma has been found at this site in two cases (Harcourt-Brown, unpublished data), one of which developed an intussusception of the colon into the caecum. Occlusion of the colon shows a more protracted course that lasts for days rather than hours. Obstructions of the large intestine are not caused by ingested foreign bodies, as the lumen of the small intestine is much smaller than that of the colon. Instead tumours, adhesions and impacted caecal contents can obstruct the colon.",

Dehydration and an unusual feeling abdomen are evident. A distended stomach may be palpable in the cranial abdomen, especially on the left side. Alternatively, the abdomen may be distended and tympanic, or feel doughy if intestinal rupture has occurred. Electrolyte imbalances cause a variety of symptoms. Twitching, blindness and convulsions can occur in the terminal stages. Abdominal radiography is usually diagnostic.

The stomach can be decompressed by passing a stomach tube to release the gas and liquid. Frequently the stomach tube blocks with hair and has to be emptied and repositioned. In most cases, the intestinal condition is rapidly fatal with death occurring within 12 h. There is a small chance of a moving foreign body passing through the small intestine and into the colon. Motility stimulants may aid this process but can also cause intestinal rupture if the gut is completely obstructed. Surgery is straightforward and successful if the case is presented early and surgery is performed rapidly. However, there are many potential life-threatening problems associated with enterotomy in rabbits; high risk anaesthesia, narrow intestinal lumen, soft friable tissue, small omentum, propensity to develop adhesions, water and electrolyte imbalances, postoperative ileus, infection and risk of recurrence due to stenosis of gut. Long-haired rabbits or those with dental problems will still have the predisposing cause even if they survive the surgery. Therefore, euthanasia is the most humane option unless the owners are keen for surgery, and accept all the risks and expense that are incurred. Gastric dilatation is also a feature of mucoid enteropathy. The onset is usually more gradual than dilatation due to an intestinal obstruction. A palpably, impacted caecum in association with gastric dilatation is suggestive of mucoid enteropathy. Radiology can be used to differentiate the two conditions (see Figures 10.4 and 10.9), although exploratory laparotomy may be indicated to confirm the diagnosis.",

It is visibly distended with gas and fluid cranial to the obstruction. The topographical anatomy of the small intestine and its relationship to other abdominal organs is illustrated in Figure 10 .5. Once the obstruction is located, the intestinal loop can be exteriorized and the surrounding tissues protected by sterile absorbent material. The intestinal contents are milked away from the obstruction before applying bowel clamps or asking an assistant to occlude the intestine with digital pressure. The enterotomy incision is made along the antimesenteric edge of the intestine distal to the foreign body to avoid placing sutures in devitalized tissue. The foreign body is removed and any everted mucosa trimmed off before suturing the wound with a single layer of appositional interrupted sutures making sure that they include the submucosa (see Figure 15 .1). A fine inert, absorbable monofilament suture material with a high tensile strength is required, such as 5/0 poliglecaprone (Monocryl) or polydioxanone (PDS II, Ethicon). The repair of an intestinal incision is difficult due to the small diameter of the organ and the friability of the tissue. It is important to avoid stenosis as much as possible as it increases the possibility of re-obstruction at a later date. If enterectomy is indicated, the intestine should be sectioned at a slight angle to preserve its antimesenteric vascularity. Although techniques such as side-to-side or side-to-end anastomosis can be performed, they have no advantage over an end-to-end anastomosis, which is technically simpler (Bouvy and Dupr\u00e9, 1997). A good seal to prevent leakage of intestinal contents is necessary as omentalization is difficult in rabbits due to the small omentum. Post-surgical adhesions to other organs form readily.",

Metabolites and hormones affect the rabbit's appetite for caecotrophs (Fekete, 1989 food is scarce, all caecotrophs are consumed. When food is available ad libitum, the amount of caecotrophs consumed is influenced by the protein and fibre content of the diet. Increased levels of fibre increase caecotrophy whereas high protein levels reduce it. Increasing the indigestible fibre component of the diet not only stimulates the rabbit to eat the caecotrophs but also makes the pellets firmer and less sticky. Healthy rabbits that eat a high fibre diet will consume all their caecotroph whereas rabbits that are fed ad libitum on low fibre cereal diets will often leave caecotrophs uneaten. On some diets, particularly where certain herbs or legumes are included, the soft faeces appear less attractive than usual and are not ingested (Lang, 1981) . Many diseases alter normal caecotrophic function, either by altering the consistency and composition of the caecotrophs or by interfering with the ingestion of caecotrophs from the anus (see Figure 10 .6). Rabbits that do not eat their caecotrophs are deprived of certain vitamins and amino acids that are synthesized by the caecal microflora. The effect of caecotrophy on protein and amino acid metabolism is greater in rabbits on a poor diet that is deficient in amino acids than on a diet with a higher protein content (J\u00e9csai et al., 1985) .",

Many conditions interfere with the ingestion of caecotrophs (see Figure 10 .6). Abnormalities in caecotrophy result in quantities of uneaten faecal material being deposited on the floor of the hutch or becoming entangled in the fur around the anus. The strong characteristic odour of uneaten caecotrophs and their soft, pasty consistency often misleads owners into believing their rabbit has diarrhoea. So, at the outset of the consultation, it is important to differentiate between uneaten soft faeces and true diarrhoea. Uneaten soft faeces is an unpleasant condition for both the owners and the rabbit but is not life threatening. Diarrhoea results in major disturbances in water and electrolyte metabolism and can be rapidly fatal. Caecotrophs are produced intermittently, usually once or twice every 24 h, when the animal is at rest. Copious amounts of hard faecal pellets are produced between episodes of soft faeces production and can be seen interspersed with any uneaten soft faeces in the bedding or on the floor of the hutch. Rabbits with enteritis and true diarrhoea do not produce hard faecal pellets. Instead, they produce soft faecal material that may be mixed with mucus. Rabbits suffering from caecotrophic disorders continue to eat well and produce large numbers of hard faecal pellets. Rabbits with diarrhoea are usually anorexic and depressed.",

The perineum of a rabbit is a very sensitive area and if the skin is sore, the rabbit may be reluctant to groom the area and ingest caecotrophs as they arrive at the anus. A vicious circle is formed, which results in sore, inflamed infected perineal skin (see Figure  9 .1). Rabbits with fast growing, soft, fluffy coats can develop large mats of fur around the anus and under the tail. This fluffy coat texture is impossible for these rabbits to groom themselves.

Any condition that reduces flexibility or causes immobility can result in uneaten caecotrophs. This includes restriction in a small cage or carrier. Obese rabbits are often too fat to turn round and reach their perineum, both to groom or to ingest caecotrophs. Loose-skinned individuals often develop large perineal skin folds, especially if they are overweight. These skin folds can become infected and sore, which makes grooming painful. Faecal material can become entrapped in the folds of skin and exacerbate the problem. Some obese females or even castrated males develop huge dewlaps that pose an additional physical barrier to the perineum. Rabbits that are fed ad libitum on low fibre diets are not only more likely to leave caecotrophs uneaten but are also likely to become fat and lazy. Musculoskeletal conditions that either affect the rabbit's flexibility or cause pain when it turns round to reach its anus also interfere with caecotrophy. Spinal deformities such as kyphosis or vertebral spondylitis are a common radiological finding. Arthritic joints or painful infected hocks can make a rabbit reluctant to change position to clean and groom properly.

Caecotrophs have a higher protein and water content and lower fibre content than hard faecal pellets. The amount and consistency of caecotrophs is affected by the fibre content of the diet. The type of fibre is important. Increasing the amount of indigestible fibre in the diet does not affect the volume or consistency of soft faeces because long fibre particles do not enter the caecum (Fraga et al., 1991; Garcia et al., 1995) . Increasing the fermentable fibre content of the diet does have an effect on caecotroph consistency because small fibre particles are moved into the caecum. Most sources of fibre are a mixture of fermentable and indigestible fibre so increasing the overall fibre content of the diet is likely to increase the amount of fermentable fibre that reaches the caecum. Increasing dietary fibre also increases appetite for caecotrophs and the amount of soft faeces that are produced (Caraba\u00f5 and Piquer, 1998) .",

Dehydration may play a part in the aetiopathogenesis. It is known that feeding small fibre particles that absorb water can cause caecal impaction. Bulk laxatives, such as methylcellulose or psyllium are examples. Ground up lignified material can have a similar effect.

In all cases, the impacted caecal contents were evacuated 24-48 h after prostaglandin administration.

The figure shows a lateral view of the abdomen of a 4-year-old neutered male rabbit that suffered from periodic bouts of anorexia and abdominal distension. In the interim, the rabbit had a good appetite but suffered from chronic diarrhoea. The stools were voluminous and contained a mixture of indigestible fibre particles and bacteria. Hard and soft faeces were indistinguishable. The rabbit was fed on a high fibre diet consisting of mainly grass hay with a small amount of good quality mixed ration. Vegetables appeared to exacerbate the problem. Blood samples showed a mild anaemia and hypoproteinaemia. Bouts of tympany responded to treatment with analgesics and oral trimethoprim/sulpha combinations. The rabbit was eventually euthanased. Post-mortem examination revealed a large (2-3 times normal size) flaccid caecum. Histopathological examination of the caecum and intestines showed lymphoplasmacytic enterotyphlocolitis suggestive of an immune-mediated aetiology.

In cases of caecal obstruction, there is not the history of large loose voluminous faeces in association with a good appetite. mucous membranes, may also be evident. Histopathological changes are seen in the autonomic ganglia. Chromatolysis-like degenerative changes take place in the neurons. Dysautonomic disease is well documented in the dog, cat and horse in which loss of autonomic function carries a poor prognosis although the occasional mild case can survive with careful nursing. In recent years, dysautonomia has been described in rabbits suffering from mucoid enteropathy. Cheeke (1987) observed that a strain of non-albino white rabbits with pigmented eyes were particularly susceptible to diarrhoea and that evidence of 'insufficient nerve ganglia in the intestine' was seen. An analogy with grass sickness in the horse was made. The discovery of degenerative changes in ganglionic neurons in rabbits suffering from mucoid enteritis had been made as early as 1967, but was not investigated further, although a syndrome of caecal impaction in conjunction with pulmonary oedema and urine retention was described by several authors (Van der Hage and Dorrestein, 1996) . In 1991, post-mortem examination of two sick hares found on an English estate where horses had died from grass sickness revealed changes in the ganglia and alimentary tract that were remarkably similar to those seen in grass sickness (Whitwell, 1991; Griffiths and Whitwell, 1993) . In 1996, Van der Hage and Dorrestein described the clinical findings, pathological lesions and microscopic and transmission electron microscopic features of the coeliac ganglia of 19 rabbits with mucoid enteropathy. Typical cases were selected that had died following a disease characterized by emaciation, respiratory distress, distended abdomen with a palpable obstipated caecum or a distended bladder. Degenerative changes, manifested as chromatolysis, were found in the coeliac ganglia. No viruses, infectious agents, aflatoxins or other causative agents were discovered on food analysis or on extensive examination of the liver and intestinal contents of affected animals. An analogy was again made with grass sickness in horses, which is thought to be caused by a neurotoxin.",

These signs are non-specific and can be caused by several diseases. 'Mucoid enteritis' has been the cause of significant losses in commercial breeding units with reported mortality rates of approximately 5-10% but rising to over 60% (McLeod and Katz, 1986) . Colibacillosis, enterotoxaemia, Tyzzer's disease, coccidiosis and viral enteritis can all be included in the syndrome that often affects young rabbits especially around the time of weaning. 'Mucoid enteropathy' is characterized by the presence of large amounts of mucus in the colon and is usually associated with impaction of the caecum (see Figure 10 .9). Inflammatory changes are minimal. The terms 'constipative mucoid enteropathy' or CME can also be used to describe this syndrome. At post-mortem examination, the caecum is often impacted with dried contents and gas (see Plate 23). The colon is distended with gelatinous mucus.

Mucoid enteropathy is a disease of intensively reared domestic rabbits rather than wild ones (Lelkes and Chang, 1987) . The disease is occasionally encountered in adult pet rabbits, especially after a stressful incident such as transport or parturition. It is known that increasing the amount of indigestible fibre in the diet of newly weaned rabbits significantly reduces the incidence of mucoid enteropathy. Stress appears to play a major role in the development of the disease. Enzyme deficiencies, infectious agents and enterotoxins have all been cited as other possible causes. Inflammation is not a feature of the disease and intestinal hypomotility or changes in the acidity of the caecum have been proposed as aetiological factors (Lelkes and Chang, 1987) . Investigations are often hampered by the presence of concurrent 280 Textbook of Rabbit Medicine There is gas distension of the duodenum and jejunum.

In rabbits, mucus production is a response of the hindgut to untoward stimuli (Bergdall and Dysko, 1994) and is not necessarily specific to mucoid enteropathy. Experimentally, ligation of the caecum results in a mucoid enteropathylike syndrome in some rabbits, with large amounts of mucus production in the colon. Incorporating the nerves and blood vessels in the ligature increases the likelihood of inducing a mucus hypersecretion 3-5 days after surgery (Hotchkiss and Merritt, 1996a) . Surgical removal of the caecum does not result in mucus production whereas filtrates from the ligated caecum administered to in vitro sections of colon do stimulate mucus secretion. Injection of oxytetracycline into the ligated caecum prevents colonic mucus secretion suggesting that a bacterial secretory product is the stimulus for excessive goblet cell secretion characteristic of mucoid enteropathy. Mucus secretion is also stimulated in the respiratory tract. Injections of cholestyramine into the ligated caecum can prevent the development of mucoid enteropathy-like symptoms suggesting the presence of some type of toxin (Toofanian and Targowski, 1983) .",

Wild rabbits can be infected and transmission occurs by the ingestion of sporulated oocysts in food that has been contaminated by faeces. Sporulation of the oocysts is required for infectivity and requires at least 2 days outside the host. Oocysts are extremely resistant and can remain viable in soil, on vegetation and fomites for long periods of time (Harkness and Wagner, 1995) . Recently voided faeces do not contain oocysts that are infective (Harkness, 1997 ) as a prepatent period in the presence of oxygen is required for development. Eimeria steidae has a slightly different life cycle to the intestinal Eimeria spp. Ingested oocysts hatch in the duodenum and sporozoites penetrate the intestinal mucosa before being transported to the liver, either in the blood stream, or in macrophages in the lymphatic system. Replication takes place in the mesenteric lymph nodes before transport via the hepatic portal circulation to the liver where they enter bile duct epithelial cells. Here the life cycle is completed with the ultimate release of oocysts into the bile duct. The prepatent period lasts for 15-16 days and oocysts are found in the faeces for at least 10-14 days after this (Owen, 1992) .",

The disease is caused by Clostridia spp. that are anaerobic gram-positive bacilli capable of producing powerful enterotoxins. The organisms can reside in the gut without causing disease but under certain conditions will rapidly proliferate and cause a severe enteritis. Clostridium spiroforme is a major pathogen in rabbit enterotoxaemia, although Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens may also be involved (Perkins et al., 1995) . Pathogenic rabbit strains of C. spiroforme are different from non-pathogenic strains in other species. A similar pathogenic strain has been isolated from humans affected with diarrhoea (Carman, 1993) . Rabbit isolates of C. spiroforme produce a toxin that is neutralized by antiserum to C. perfringens type E iota toxin. Virtually all rabbit isolates of C. spiroforme are toxigenic, although this is not the case in other species. Clostridium difficile produces two exotoxins, toxin A and B. Toxin A is a lethal enterotoxin that binds to specific enteroreceptors and induces fluid secretion, mucosal damage and intestinal inflammation. Toxin B is a potent cytotoxin that interacts synergistically with toxin A (Perkins et al., 1995) .",

Substantial amounts of glucose are required by C. spiriforme for toxin production. There is a marked difference in starch digestibility between adult and growing rabbits. In adult rabbits, carbohydrate is hydrolysed and absorbed before it reaches the caecum. Enterotoxaemia in adult pet rabbits is not associated with a high carbohydrate diet but usually follows a disruption of the gut flora by antibiotics, other pathogens, toxins or stress.

Experimentally, corticosteroid administration is required to reproduce the disease (Delong and Manning, 1994) .

Rotavirus was originally isolated from weanling rabbits with diarrhoea, although it has also been recovered from unaffected animals (Bryden et al., 1976) . Serological tests have revealed that rotavirus infection is widespread in colonies of domestic rabbits. The disease has been reported in many parts of the world including Japan, Europe, Canada and the USA (DiGiacomo and Mare, 1994) . In infected colonies, adult animals are seropositive and confer maternal immunity on their offspring. The young rabbits become infected when maternal immunity wears off which coincides with weaning. Infected rabbits shed virus in faeces, which is probably the main route of transmission, although there is evidence for airborne spread. Severity of clinical signs depends on virus strain, intercurrent disease, immune status and all the other factors that are involved in enteric disease in weanling rabbits. In a study by Thouless et al. (1996) , it was found that concurrent infection with rotavirus and E. coli resulted in increased mortality and morbidity due to diarrhoeal disease compared with infection with E. coli alone.",

The primary presenting signs are lethargy and reduced appetite, which can progress to other symptoms (Swartout and Gerken, 1987) . Typical haematological changes of anaemia and basophilic stippling may be seen in chronic cases. Reduced appetite appears to be linked with slow gut motility. Radiographically, radiopaque material may be seen in the stomach and unevacuated hard faeces may be seen the large intestine. Treatment with motility agents such as cisapride or metaclopramide in addition to a chelating agent, such as sodium calcium edetate or D-penicillamine, facilitates excretion of the lead from the gut. An advantage of the rabbit's rapid elimination of large particles is that flakes of lead paint will be quickly passed out in the hard faeces rather than moved into the caecum and retained in the body for longer periods before being re-ingested.",

In many cases, diseases are treated with home remedies or by culling affected stock. Halftruths, myths and legends abound, although some traditional remedies have a grain of truth or some sound common sense in them. Professional veterinary advice is seldom sought except when a disease threatens all the stock, a prize-winning bloodline or perhaps a particularly valuable individual. Expense is always an issue. Cases of enteritis can be difficult and expensive to investigate and treat. Prompt, detailed post-mortem examinations and laboratory investigations are required. The causes are often multifactorial and home visits to examine the stock and assess the husbandry may be needed. Successful treatment of individual rabbits with enteric conditions is difficult and usually expensive. Intensive therapy, including intravenous fluids, hospitalization and nursing, is required despite the breeder's expectation that some 'wonder drug' will provide an instant cure. Therefore compromises have to be made and general principles applied to prevent further losses. Post-mortem examination is extremely valuable and all dead rabbits should be examined, not just one or two, as soon after death as possible. Microscopic examination of impression smears, gut contents and faeces can be a cheap way of obtaining information. A provisional diagnosis of mucoid enteropathy, coccidiosis or enterotoxaemia can be made from post-mortem examination, although concurrent infections can be present. Histology or specialized laboratory techniques are required to confirm the diagnosis or detect viral infections.",

It may be advisable for breeders to take a break in their breeding programme and reduce stocking density so they have no young susceptible rabbits on the premises for a few weeks. A break gives the opportunity to clean and disinfect the premises thoroughly, and reduce the number of pathogens in the environment. Simply washing cages and hutches thoroughly in hot water and detergent to remove organic debris is beneficial and can be followed by the use of a disinfectant that kills viruses and bacteria. Povidone-iodine compounds such as Tamodine (Vetark) or non-irritant Virkon can be used. Coccidial oocysts are particularly resistant to disinfection but are susceptible to desiccation. The use of a blowtorch to flame hutches is a simple method of killing oocysts or a 10% solution of ammonia is effective (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) . Ammonia is unpleasant and potentially hazardous to handle. Soil may need to be removed and replaced in outdoor enclosures. The introduction of a feed containing a coccidiostat can be required in the long term. ",

There is no cross-immunity between the species \u2022 Most Eimeria species affect the intestine and heavy infestations cause inappetance, weight loss and diarrhoea. Blood may be seen in the faeces \u2022 One species, Eimeria steidae, has a complex life cycle involving the bile ducts. Infection causes 'hepatic coccidiosis', characterized by impaired liver function. Heavy infestations result in jaundice and liver failure \u2022 Newly weaned rabbits are most susceptible to coccidiosis. It is rare in the individual, adult pet \u2022 Sulpha drugs are used to treat coccidiosis in rabbits. The disease is controlled in commercial rabbit colonies and breeding stock by including coccidiostats in the food \u2022 Enterotoxaemia is a cause of diarrhoea and sudden death in rabbits. Clostridial species, notably C. spiroforme, are the most usual pathogens \u2022 Clostridia spp. can be present in the gut flora of healthy rabbits. Disruption of the normal bacterial population allows clostridia to proliferate \u2022 Stress, antibiotic therapy and dietary change are predisposing factors to enterotoxaemia. Juvenile rabbits are most susceptible \u2022 Glucose is required as a substrate for enterotoxin formation by Clostridium spiroforme. Juvenile rabbits absorb carbohydrates less efficiently than adults. High carbohydrate diets are believed to be a predisposing cause of enterotoxaemia in growing rabbits in commercial colonies \u2022 Adult rabbits digest and absorb starch efficiently from the small intestine and high carbohydrate diets do not appear to predispose enterotoxaemia in adults \u2022 The prognosis for rabbits with enterotoxaemia is poor \u2022 Escherichia coli can cause diarrhoea. Pathogenicity is affected by the strain of E. coli and predisposing factors. Suckling rabbits are most susceptible \u2022 Other infectious causes of enteritis in rabbits include Tyzzer's disease (caused by Clostridium piliformis), salmonella and viral infections such as rotavirus \u2022 Poisoning can be manifested by digestive disease. Heavy metal poisons such as lead or poisonous plants can be ingested by rabbits, especially house rabbits.",
