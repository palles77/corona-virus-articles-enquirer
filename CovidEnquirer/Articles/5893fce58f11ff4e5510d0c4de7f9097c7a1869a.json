FCoV exhibits 2 biotypes: the pathogenic disease and a benign infection with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). Uncertainty remains regarding whether genetically distinctive avirulent and virulent forms coexist or whether an avirulent form mutates in vivo, causing FIP. To resolve these alternative hypotheses, we isolated viral sequences from FCoV-infected clinically healthy and sick cats (8 FIP cases and 48 FECV-asymptomatic animals); 735 sequences from 4 gene segments were generated and subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Viral sequences from healthy cats were distinct from sick cats on the basis of genetic distances observed in the membrane and nonstructural protein 7b genes. These data demonstrate distinctive circulating virulent and avirulent strains in natural populations. In addition, 5 membrane protein amino acid residues with functional potential differentiated healthy cats from cats with FIP. These findings may have potential as diagnostic markers for virulent FIP-associated FCoV.",

Although FCoV is common in most domestic, feral, and nondomestic cat populations worldwide (seroprevalence 20%-100%), FIP will develop in <10% of FCoV seropositive cats (1) (2) (3) (4) . FIP tends to occur most frequently in cats <2 years of age or, less commonly, in geriatric cats (4, 5) . The clinical manifestations of FCoV infection can be either a pathogenic disease, FIP (cases infected with feline infectious perito-nitis virus [FIPV] ) and, more commonly, a benign, or mild enteric infection (feline enteric coronavirus [FECV] asymptomatic) (6, 7) . Specific genetic determinants of these clinical outcomes have yet to be discovered.

The precise nature of the mutation responsible for pathogenesis has not been identified, although studies have suggested sequence differences in the spike protein (14) , nonstructural protein (NSP) 7b, and NSP3c (13) as disease determinants. Together with in vitro studies describing the FIPV strains affinity for macrophages in contrast to FECV strains (15) , the hypothesis was extended to propose that the enteric coronavirus (FECV) undergoes a mutational shift in the gastrointestinal system, thus allowing infection of macrophages, systemic dissemination, and fatal disease manifestation (12, 13) . However, attempts to use engineered chimeric viruses designed to identify the operative virulence determinants have been unsuccessful (16) . Furthermore, circulating FCoVs found in different tissues of FCoV-infected asymptomatic cats were indistinguishable (17, 18) .",

We developed a study of naturally occurring FECV and FIPV using molecular genetic tools by collecting samples from field cases of FIP (cases) and FECV-positive but asymptomatic cats (controls). Cases were infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV) and had the clinical disease of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). Controls were also infected with FCoV, but were clinically asymptomatic (FECV-asymptomatic). The prediction was that phylogenetic analysis of viral gene sequences would demonstrate paraphyly for FIP case-cats and FECV-asymptomatic cats if the in vivo mutation hypothesis was supported, and monophyly of the 2 if the circulating virulent/ avirulent hypothesis was supported ( Figure 1 ). Additionally, we surveyed the viral genetic diversity and dynamics and determined genetic signatures associated with pathogenesis in FIP.",

Modeltest was used to estimate the optimal model of sequence evolution, and these settings were incorporated into subsequent analyses (28) . Minimum evolution trees were constructed from models of substitution specified by Modeltest, with starting trees obtained by neighbor joining followed by application of a tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping algorithm during a heuristic search for the optimal tree. Maximum parsimony analysis employed a heuristic search of starting trees obtained by stepwise addition followed by TBR. Maximum-likelihood parameters specified by Modeltest selected the general time-reversible model of substitution, included empirical base frequencies, and estimated rate matrix and corrected for among-site rate variation (gamma distribution). A bootstrap analysis using 1,000 iterations was performed for maximum parsimony and minimum evolution and 100 iterations by using the nearest neighbor interchange branch-swapping algorithm for maximum likelihood.

First, gene sequences from healthy cats infected with FECV displayed a monophyletic cluster pattern that was generally distinctive from cats diagnosed with FIP in the membrane, NSP 7b, and spike-NSP3 gene segments (Figure 4 ). For example, every FCoV gene sequence for the membrane gene from FIP cases fell within a major cluster consisting of 3 principal clades (Figure 4 ). By contrast, 127/154 (82%) virus gene sequences from FECV-asymptomatic cats sorted in 2 separate clades that were distinct (100 bootstrap statistical support) from the viral gene sequences of FIP cases ( Figure  4 ). Similar reciprocal monophyly of 140 NSP7b sequences was obtained for FIP cases versus FECV-asymptomatic cats (Figure 4) . A consistent disease driven phylogeographic sorting was also observed for the 1,017-bp sequence spanning the spike-NSP3 genes, albeit with less statistical resolution, likely because of evolutionary constraints on gene divergence in this region (Figure 4 ). Together the remarkable reciprocal monophyly in these 3 genes supports the predictions of the circulating virulent-avirulent strain hypothesis illustrated in Figure 1 .",

However, in some cats, FCoV infection is associated with the development of the progressive and fatal disease manifestation of FIP. This disease is among the most serious viral infections in cats, not only because of its fatal nature, but also because of the difficulties in diagnosing FIP antemortem and controlling the spread of FCoV. We have presented a molecular virologic study of naturally occurring FCoV infection and phylogenetic analysis of the cloned virus sequences obtained from the membrane, NSP 7b, spike-NSP3, and pol 1a genes isolated from domestic cats located in Maryland households infected with FCoV during 2004-2006. We observed predominately monophyletic clustering of strains correlating with disease phenotype in membrane and NSP 7b genes consistent with the circulating virulent/ avirulent strain hypothesis of FIP pathogenesis, which calls into question the in vivo mutation hypothesis.",

Cats in our study were not co-infected with multiple strains of FECV and FIPV at the same time and were generally infected with one predominant virus strain. Two exceptions to this finding in our study were cats with cases of FIPV (Fca-4662 and 4664) that from which distinct gastrointestinal (feces or intestine) and systemic (liver and/or ascites fluid) viral isolates were obtained, which indicates that in vivo superinfection does occur (Figure 4 ; online Appendix Table 2 ).",

The ill horses exhibited abnormal behavior-running about excitedly, walking into walls, being unable to chew food. A similar disease had been observed in horses, sheep, and cattle for more than 100 years. The causative agent was later found to be a negativestranded RNA virus, which may also be a human pathogen.",
