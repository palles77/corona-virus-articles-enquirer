The SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 as an important cause of severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans, and FIPV infection causes a chronic and often fatal peritonitis in cats. A unique collection of 33 plant lectins with different specificities were evaluated. The plant lectins possessed marked antiviral properties against both coronaviruses with EC 50 values in the lower microgram/ml range (middle nanomolar range), being non-toxic (CC 50 ) at 50-100 g/ml. The strongest anti-coronavirus activity was found predominantly among the mannose-binding lectins. In addition, a number of galactose-, N-acetylgalactosamine-, glucose-, and N-acetylglucosamine-specific plant agglutinines exhibited anti-coronaviral activity. A significant correlation (with an r-value of 0.70) between the EC 50 values of the 10 mannose-specific plant lectins effective against the two coronaviruses was found. In contrast, little correlation was seen between the activity of other types of lectins. Two targets of possible antiviral intervention were identified in the replication cycle of SARS-CoV. The first target is located early in the replication cycle, most probably viral attachment, and the second target is located at the end of the infectious virus cycle.",

During the 2002-2003 winter season, a new human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, was isolated in The Netherlands (van der Hoek et al., 2004) . The recurrent detection of HCoV-NL63 in patient samples worldwide indicates that HCoV-NL63 can be considered as a new important etiologic agent in respiratory tract infections (Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005; Moes et al., 2005) . The fifth human coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1 was discovered in 2004 by a Chinese group (Woo et al., 2005) .

In cats, two coronaviruses are described, the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). These feline coronaviruses are spread worldwide and infect domestic cats and other members of the Felidae family. An infection with FECV is usually subclinical, except in young kittens where it may cause mild to severe diarrhea (Pedersen et al., 1981) . In contrast, FIPV infection causes a chronic and very often fatal peritonitis which is the most important cause of death of infectious origin in cats.",

They are widespread among higher plants and are subdivided into seven families of structurally and evolutionarily related proteins (Van Damme et al., 1998) . More than a decade ago, plant lectins were reported to inhibit HIV replication in lymphocyte cell cultures through inhibition of virus-cell fusion (Balzarini et al., 1991; Matsui et al., 1990; Hammar et al., 1989; Hansen et al., 1989) . Plant lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins capable of specific recognition and reversible binding to carbohydrates. Initially, it was reported that plant lectins inhibit virus replication by preventing virus adsorption (Muller et al., 1988) , but it was later shown that they prevent fusion of HIV particles with their target cells (Balzarini et al., 1991 (Balzarini et al., , 1992 . In addition to the antiviral effect of mannose-and N-acetylglucosamine-specific agglutinins on HIV, an inhibitory effect of these plant lectins was reported on cytomegalovirus infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection and influenza A virus infection in vitro (Balzarini et al., 1991 (Balzarini et al., , 1992 (Balzarini et al., , 2004 . The SARS-CoV spike protein is heavily glycosylated and contains 23 putative Nglycosylation sites, among which 12 have been described to be effectively glycosylated (Krokhin et al., 2003) . One may therefore expect coronavirus infectivity to be inhibited by those lectins that are specific for the glycans present in the spike glycoprotein.",

The drug-exposed virus preparation was then diluted 1000-fold before being used to infect Vero E6 cells. Although reduced infectivity was seen with the highest HHA concentration (i.e. 640 g/ml), this antiviral effect can not be ascribed to the preexposure of the virus to the plant lectin HHA, but was a result of the residual HHA concentration of 0.64 g/ml, which is only five times below the EC 50 and offers background protection against viral induced CPE. Thus, pre-exposure of the virus preparations to HHA did not affect the viral replication capacity in the Vero cell cultures. Similarly pre-exposure of the Vero E6 cells, instead of the virus, to the lectins revealed no significantly increased protective activity of the lectins against the virus-induced cytopathicity in pre-treated Vero E6 cells as compared to the SARS-CoV-infected cell cultures that were not pre-incubated with the lectins (data not shown).

The lectins with anticoronaviral activity included mannose-, glucose-, galactose-, N-acetyl glucosamine-and N-acetyl galactosamine-specific agglutinins In general plant lectins were more toxic to CrFK cells than to Vero E6 cells. This could partly explain some differences between the SARS-CoV activity and FIPV activity of plant lectins. Most of the lectins that were not active against FIPV were too toxic for the CrFK cells. The most prominent anti-coronavirus activity was found among the mannose-specific plant lectins. In the SARS-CoV spike protein there are 12 N-glycosylation sites. The sugars attached to four of these Nglycosylation sites have been identified (Krokhin et al., 2003) . Two of the four sugars were found to be high-mannose type glycans, whereas the other two showed complex glycan structures (Krokhin et al., 2003) . The presence of high-mannose type glycans can explain the potent anti-SARS-CoV activity of mannose-specific plant lectins. When we compare the activity spectrum of the plant lectins against coronaviruses with their activity spectrum against HIV, only the mannose-specific plant lectins, with the exception of UDA, which is a N-acetyl glucosamine-specific lectin, possess antiviral activity against HIV (Balzarini et al., 1991 (Balzarini et al., , 1992 . Thus, the carbohydrate spectrum of plant lectins that inhibit virus infection is broader for coronaviruses than for HIV.",

In contrast to HIV, the plant lectins did not show marked virucidal properties against the SARS-CoV, neither when they were pre-incubated with the cells, nor when preincubated with the virus.

            "text": "To elucidate the mechanism of antiviral intervention of the plant lectins, a time-of-addition assay was elaborated using the mannose-specific lectin of the amaryllis (HHA). The lectin was added to the infected cell cultures at different time-points post-infection. At 8 h post-infection, the SARS-CoV viral load was quantified intracellularly and extracellularly. A marked difference was noted between these two measurements. The intracellular viral RNA-load could only be efficiently reduced when the lectin was added at the time of infection, indicating that the plant lectins interact with an early step in the viral replication cycle. In general, the SARS-CoV entry starts with the attachment of the virus to its specific receptor ACE2 on the cell surface. The receptor binding subsequently induces the viral envelope protein to undergo conformational changes that mediate fusion between the viral and cellular membranes (Doms, 2004) . The coronavirus spike glycoprotein is responsible for these two steps in the coronavirus entry process. Since each step of the viral entry pathway is a potential target for antiviral agents, entry inhibitors fall into several categories. A first class consists of inhibitors that bind to the ACE2 receptor, a second category comprises entry inhibitors that bind to the virus and prevent it from interacting with its receptors and a third group of inhibitors can hamper the conformational changes, resulting in the inhibition of SARS-CoV fusion with the target cell. In order to distinguish between these categories of entry inhibitors more in-depth studies were conducted. The virus entry assay showed that HHA was active when incubating the cells and virus at 4 \u2022 C. This low temperature incubation allows most virions to irreversibly attach to the cells, but not to penetrate the cells. Moreover, when this slower and irreversible attachment was achieved at 4 \u2022 C, HHA was two times more active (EC 50 = 2.5 g/ml) in comparison to attachment and penetration at 37 \u2022 C (EC 50 = 5.2 g/ml). This observation indicates that this compound most probably interferes with virus attachment. To elucidate if HHA is an ACE2 receptor inhibitor or an entry inhibitor which binds the virus, and prevent it in this way from interacting with its receptor, we pre-incubated HHA with either the SARS-CoV or with the cells. Pre-incubation of HHA with the virus did not provide inhibition of virus replication, nor did the pre-incubation of HHA with the cells. These pre-incubation experiments did not help us to understand the mechanism of action of the plant lectins.",

Huang and colleagues observed that the presence of the spike protein in a pseudoparticle is necessary for budding and formation of a corona-like structure (Huang et al., 2004) . This indicates that the spike protein is likely to be important not only for viral attachment and fusion, but also for maturation and egress from cells. Earlier we demonstrated that one SARS-CoV replication cycle takes 6 h to complete in Vero E6 cells . Therefore, inhibition of extracellular viral RNA-load up to 5 h post-infection suggests interference at the level of exocytosis or egress from the cell. Taken together, we could clearly demonstrate that the plant lectins interact both at virus entry and at virus release, a phenomenon that has never been observed for other viruses, including HIV.",

In view of the fact that the SARS-CoV discovery led to the identification of two new human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, both of which are associated with serious lower respiratory diseases, the search for efficient anti-coronavirus compounds becomes more important. Our findings on the selective and potent anti-coronavirus activity of plant lectins should trigger further research on the discovery of other carbohydrate-binding agents, including synthetic low-molecular-weight compounds.",
