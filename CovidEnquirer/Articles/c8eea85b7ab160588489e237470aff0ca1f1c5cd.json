            "text": "As repertory grid approach has been widely used by researchers, some extensions have been made to enhance its representative ability. For example, Jose, Nicholas, Jennings, Luo, and Shadbolt, 2003 developed a technique using a fuzzy repertory grid for acquiring the finite set of attributes or variables that the expert uses in a classification problem, characterizing and discriminating a set of elements. In addition, several models have been proposed to generate more meaningful rules from the repertory gridoriented approaches, such as the EMCUD method, which can generate embedded meanings from repertory grids by defining the impacts of the constructs to each element (Hwang & Tseng, 1990) . Recently, Hwang et al. (2006) indicated that, in building medical expert systems, most of the previous knowledge acquisition methods only pay attentions to the relationships between diseases and symptoms, while, the variant of the symptoms in different time scales of the diseases are not taken into account. Consider the repertory grid given in Table 1 which depicts an example of eliciting knowledge for diagnosing various kinds of gastrointestinal diseases. Note that the rating of the (Acute bronchitis, Throat pain) entry is 4, which implies highly tendency for Acute bronchitis to have Throat pain. However, in practical situation, Influenza has significant appearance of Throat pain in the early time scale. What has been addressed in the repertory grid is not happened in the last time scale of acute bronchitis. For later time scale, the throat pain symptom will become not so significant. Such variant of disease symptoms with respect to different time scales cannot be precisely presented by those conventional knowledge acquisition approaches.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of the novel approach, a knowledge acqui-sition system has been developed, and seven medical experts were asked to participate in an experiment. From the experimental results, it can be seen that our novel approach able to achieve significantly better performance, and hence, we conclude that the new approach is helpful in enhancing repertory grid efficacy.
