Although considerable effort has been placed on assuring the quality of the peptide identification with respect to spectral processing, to date quality assessment of the subsequent peptide abundance data matrix has been limited to a subjective visual inspection of run-by-run correlation or individual peptide components. Identifying statistical outliers is a critical step in the processing of proteomics data as many of the downstream statistical analyses [e.g. analysis of variance (ANOVA)] rely upon accurate estimates of sample variance, and their results are influenced by extreme values. Results: We describe a novel multivariate statistical strategy for the identification of LC-MS runs with extreme peptide abundance distributions. Comparison with current method (runby-run correlation) demonstrates a significantly better rate of identification of outlier runs by the multivariate strategy. Simulation studies also suggest that this strategy significantly outperforms correlation alone in the identification of statistically extreme liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) runs.",

However, * To whom correspondence should be addressed. the ANOVA approach relies upon accurate estimates of sample variance, and proteomics studies not only have inherent variability associated with the biological samples, but potentially diverse process-based sources of variability. That is, the accurate estimate of sample variances is often difficult to obtain. For example, sample preparation protocols and instrument variations associated with the LC column (particularly important for multi-column platforms) and mass spectrometer can cause variations in peak intensities, as well as peptides identified across MS analyses within an experiment. Data quality is especially important when the number of biological samples is small, often the case in proteomics experiments, and extreme values can negatively influence all subsequent data analysis outcomes.",

            "text": "Identification of statistical outliers in univariate data is an established but highly debated statistical topic (Barnett and Lewis, 1994; Hawkins, 1980) . There are many consecutive outlier procedures, focusing on one suspect value at a time, that have been proposed and implemented across many fields of application, such as Grubbs' test and Dixon's Q-test (Dixon, 1950; Grubbs, 1950) . Because these methods iteratively remove outlier points, the false positive rate (i.e. Type 1 error) is inflated (Jain, 2010) . In contrast, recursive outlier detection procedures detect the presence of any number of outliers and control Type 1 errors. For example, Jain (2010) presents a recursive version of Grubbs' test and Caroni and Prescott (1992) derived a sequential application of Wilks's multivariate outlier test. There are downfalls to these recursive procedures: (i) they are designed for univariate data, and if applied to multivariate data, will likely fail to detect statistically influential extreme values, and (ii) they are negatively affected by masking (i.e. the inability to detect an outlier in the presence of another outlier) and swamping (i.e. identify non-outliers as outliers) effects.",

The determination of 'low' correlation is subjective, and varies across analysts, experiments and time. Correlation may be examined via a heat map in which a color palette represents the numeric value, the color palette choice as well as the range of correlation values it covers can be highly subjective and extremely influential on the selection of which runs should be removed from the dataset. In addition, the sample correlation coefficient can only be computed across peptides with common identifications between runs (i.e. it does not account for missing data), it does not account for the multivariate nature of LC-MS runs, nor is there any statistical certainty associated with the exclusion of a run.",

            "text": "Advanced statistical approaches to outlier detection in proteomics data have focused either on the identification of outlier spectra maps (Rudnick et al., 2010; Schulz-Trieglaff et al., 2009) or on peptide/protein abundances independent of LC-MS run behavior (Cho et al., 2008; MacCoss et al., 2003; Xia et al., 2006) . Rudnick et al. (2010) described a large set of metrics for the quantitative assessment of system performance and evaluation of technical variability among inter-and intra-laboratory LC-MS/MS proteomics experiments. However, the use of these metrics to assess the quality of an individual LC-MS/MS run is not addressed. Schulz-Trieglaff et al. (2009) applied a multivariate method to perform a quality assessment of raw LC-MS maps using 20 quality descriptors. The goal of their approach was to identify and remove outlier runs using unprocessed spectra before noise filtering, peak detection or centroiding was performed. Cho et al. (2008) presented a peptide outlier detection method using quantile regression to account for the heterogeneity of variance between replicate LC-MS/MS runs. Peptide intensity ratios were plotted on an MA plot, where M is the difference in peptide abundance values and A is the average peptide intensity value. MacCoss et al. (2003) developed a correlation algorithm to detect outlier peptides using fractional changes between sample and reference intensities. Xia et al. (2006) proposed a two-stage method, combining Dixon's Q-test and a median absolute deviation (MAD) modified z-score test, for outlier detection of peptide ratios. These latter methods focus on assessing individual peptides for extreme behavior rather than the distribution of peptide abundance values for an entire LC-MS run.",

Features from the LC-MS analyses were matched to AMT tags to identify peptides, using an initial tolerance of \u00b13 p.p.m. for mass and 2.5% for the LC normalized elution time (NET).

Simulation is useful to investigate the properties of rMd-PAV, however; since simulation of expected distribution parameters in real proteomics data is not well understood, these results are presented in Supplementary Material (Rocke et al., 2009) . The results of the multi-dimensional outlier detection analysis are displayed in a simple yet effective graphic in which rMd-PAV scores are plotted for each LC-MS run and compared with a reference line representing the \u03c7 2 critical value. For improved visualization, the rMd-PAV scores and the \u03c7 2 critical value are transformed to the log 2 scale. The red horizontal line represents the log 2 (\u03c7 2 0.9999,5 ) critical value. That is, at a significance level of 0.0001, a LC-MS run may be classified as a statistical outlier if the calculated test statistic \u2265 \u03c7 2 0.9999,5 critical value, or equivalently, the \u03c7 2 P \u2264 0.0001. LC-MS runs with log 2 (rMd-PAV) scores above the red horizontal line are suspect and should be removed from the dataset.",

Cell monolayers were inoculated with SARS for 40 min at 37 \u2022 C, and sham-infected controls were inoculated with medium only. Following inoculation, monolayers were rinsed and incubated for times 0, 3, 7, 12, 24, 30, 36 and 48 h. At the indicated times post-infection, wells were washed three times with ice cold 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer and cells lyzed for 5 min in ice cold 8 M urea. Samples were frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C until assayed. Samples were analyzed in triplicate, except where noted in Supplementary Table S2 , and the minimum occurrence filter returned a total of 26 776 peptides (Webb-Robertson et al., 2010) . This study included three biological replicates per time point as well as a large number of LC-MS runs (n = 141), thus the removal of runs with poor quality abundance data is essential to maintain statistical power in downstream analyses. An LC-MS expert at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory upon reviewing the chromatography maps for this study was able to designate 28 out of 141 (\u223c20%) LC-MS analyses as suspect due to various reasons (e.g. electrospray instability, elution time, sample prep/collection problem). We performed the rMd-PAV analysis, and compared its performance with t correlation alone to identify statistical outliers (runs at the peptide abundance level) via a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.",

Rather, the results of any statistical outlier algorithm used should always be reviewed in the context of the research goal and the experiment. Often the extreme data values are of interest and may explain technical difficulties in the process (e.g. sample preparation issues, technical difficulties with instrumentation and a mislabeling of samples). However, as with any statistical analysis and especially those dealing with small sample sizes, reviewing the outcome of the analysis is imperative. Specifically, graphical methods allow the analyst to review the analysis in a stepwise manner.

The value of the multivariate outlier discovery strategy utilizing rMd-PAV scores is the use of an objective probabilistic model to assess statistical certainty of the exclusion of runs within an experiment in the context of the complete dataset. Proteomics has placed considerable effort on assuring the quality of the peptide identification with respect to spectral processing (Piening et al., 2006; Rudnick et al., 2010; Schulz-Trieglaff et al., 2009; Stead et al., 2008) ; however, quality assessment of the subsequent data matrix has focused on subjective visual inspection of run-by-run correlation, or individual peptide components. The quality of the LC-MS peptide abundance data matrix is essential to the identification of robust biomarkers. Moreover, statistical evaluation of the data relies upon tools often based on linear models, such as ANOVA which require accurate estimates of variance (Bukhman et al., 2008; Daly et al., 2008; Karpievitch et al., 2009; Oberg et al., 2008) . Without proper identification of statistical outlier runs the estimates of variance will be inflated, which may have a considerable effect on the identification of significant peptides and proteins.",
