In relation to human populations, we focus primarily on human health as an index of well-being. We also introduce concepts of climate justice. Many of our examples are taken from the United States, although we also include other regions of the world in our analysis as appropriate. We discuss various ways in which mitigation and adaptation strategies can help reduce the magnitude and the impacts of the changes we are likely to experience, as well as improve human health and directly or indirectly affect ecosystem functions and services. Finally, although our analysis sets priorities and orders of importance for an ideal world unimpeded by political considerations, cultural differences, or economic limitations, we include a discussion of the social considerations that we believe must be incorporated into the development and application of mitigation or adaptation strategies.",

In 2004, transportation accounted for 23% of the world's energy-related GHG emissions and road transportation represented 74% of the total carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from transportation (IPCC 2007b) . In addition to being a major source of emissions, transportation also significantly affects ecosystem functions and services. Pollution from vehicles affects ecosystem services such as clean air and water directly, and indirectly through impacts on the plants and animals that regulate ecosystem function. As species are lost from or move into ecosystems the functioning of those systems can change, resulting in altered ecosystem services. Human health is likewise affected by pollution from vehicles (e.g., through chronic lung disease). Transportation networks and moving vehicles also fragment landscapes, reducing the flows of energy and biota resulting in isolated populations and potentially making these populations vulnerable to extirpation and impairing ecosystem functions.",

For example, increasing the efficiency of light-duty vehicles (cars and small trucks) has the potential to reduce their carbon emissions by up to 50% by 2030 (IPCC 2007b) . Such efficiencies can be attained by a combination of reducing vehicle weights, increasing aerodynamics, increasing engine efficiency (particularly diesel engine efficiency), and increasing the use of biofuels and electric and hybrid vehicles. In 2006, the International Energy Association projected that the proportion of transportation energy supplied by biofuels could be increased to 10% (IEA 2006a) . Although there is good evidence of successful biofuel markets and programs (e.g., ethanol from sugarcane in Brazil, Goldemberg 2007) , there are also negative consequences of increased biofuel production for biodiversity and carbon storage (Fargione et al. 2008; Fletcher et al. 2010) . One opportunity for transportation mitigation strategy is the promotion of behavioral changes of drivers. Efficiency of road vehicles could be improved by 5-20% by changes in driving styles, improved maintenance, more efficient tires, reduced idling, and traffic design and maintenance (IPCC 2007b).",

Recent climate modeling has demonstrated a positive feedback in the 'dust bowl' drought of the 1930s in the United States (Schubert et al. 2004; Cook et al. 2009 ). Cook et al.

As a result of the dust bowl, more than 50% of the surveyed farms comprising 8.7 million acres were seriously eroded, and the economic loss was valued close to US$200 million (AAAS 1936) .

Increases in livestock production and meat consumption are also blamed for the evolution of new and virulent emergent diseases. Any improvement in the environmental sustainability of livestock production will concurrently have a benefit for human health. Pelletier and Tyedmers (2010) estimated that globally the livestock sector contributed 14% of anthropogenic GHG emissions, 63% of reactive nitrogen mobilization, and consumed 58% of human-appropriated biomass as of 2000. Reduction in GHG emissions in agriculture can be achieved by developing strategies involving improved production efficiency, land-use changes, cropland and rangeland management, and livestock and manure management (Rosenzweig and Tubiello 2007; Smith et al. 2008; Burney et al. 2010; Pelletier and Tyedmers 2010) . For example, enhancing production efficiency through agricultural intensification has been credited with the avoidance of 161 Gt of carbon emission globally since 1961 (Burney et al. 2010 ). This figure highlights that the investment in agricultural research to improve the environmental sustainability of global food production systems (i.e., livestock, crop, and aquatic systems) should be a prioritized mitigation strategy (Lobell et al. 2008; Burney et al. 2010; Steinfeld and Gerber 2010) . Another mitigation strategy to reduce emissions involves shifting livestock production regimes from ruminants to more efficient and lower impact monogastric species (e.g., poultry), well-managed fisheries and aquaculture, and promoting plant-based protein sources (Pelletier and Tyedmers 2010; Steinfeld and Gerber 2010) .",

The most efficient appliances in use today use half to one-fifth of their most inefficient counterparts currently in use (IPCC 2007b) . In developed countries, substituting smaller and more efficient refrigerators, washing machines, and other appliances for less efficient ones can substantially reduce energy use. In addition, in developed countries, improvements in the efficiency of electronic devices with inefficient standby modes and power supplies (or more simply unplugging these devices when not in use) can significantly reduce energy consumption. In developing countries where biomass (e.g., wood, dung, and charcoal) is used for cooking fuel, substantial reductions in GHG emissions and improvements in human health may be attained by increasing the efficiency of biomass stoves, fostering a shift to cleaner burning liquid and gaseous fuels, and improving access to electricity (IPCC 2007b).",

Tidal barrages allow water to flow into a bay or estuary during flood tide, then they release the water back during ebb tide. As water is released it flows through turbines generating energy. The impact of barrages on fish may be substantial (Aprahamian et al. 2010) . Power can also be extracted in the marine environment by turbines in regions of high wave and current energy.

Similarly, passive solar heating of buildings (mentioned in the Section 4.25.2.2 Shelter) is an effective heating measure in many regions. Finally, solar energy can be used to generate power with solar thermal electric plants that focus solar rays to heat a liquid, which is then used to generate electricity. Passive solar space heating and hot water production likely have the lowest environmental costs.

Assumed cobenefits include the suite of ecosystem services such as watershed protection; reduction of soil erosion; flood control; provision of fuel, timber, and foods; and cultural and spiritual amenities for local communities. Biodiversity is presumably also enhanced by protecting natural systems. It is possible that forest-dependent communities will be able to maintain access to forests through this initiative.

These proposed approaches are still on the scientific fringe and considered to be highly unproven and/or potentially quite risky. One such approach is to capture carbon in the oceans through iron fertilization. In regions of the ocean where there are ample nutrients to drive primary production (photosynthesis) but observations show that chlorophyll is relatively low, the lack of iron is thought to limit the productivity. Over the last two decades, several experiments have attempted to determine whether the addition of elemental iron into the water could cause an increase in algal production and ultimately, as photosynthesis fixes carbon into organic molecules that then sink, the sequestration of carbon in deep ocean sediments. However, the results of these experiments are mixed (de Baar et al. 2005) , with the export of carbon being difficult to assess and likely quite modest. At the same time, the impacts on local ecosystems and thus ultimately fisheries in potentially highly productive regions of the subpolar oceans are not yet known. Other carbon sequestration approaches have also been proposed including pumping air down into the oceans, injecting carbon into the ground, and incorporating biochar into soils.",

At present, these approaches are unproven, risky, and, at best, will only address some of the impacts of the human influence on climate. One such geoengineering approach would inject sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere. These aerosols would reflect incoming solar rays and reduce warming. Although such an approach might reduce average global temperatures, it would also likely decrease average global precipitation (Bala et al. 2008 ) as well as alter atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns. For a given change in radiative forcing, solar forcing is more effective at changing the hydrological cycle than forcing from carbon dioxide owing to differences in the surface latent heat (and thus evaporation) response. While the impact of carbon dioxide fertilization could increase net primary production in terrestrial ecosystems (Govindasamy et al. 2002) , ecosystems could continue to be vulnerable due to changes in water resources. In addition, solar radiation management would not address the potentially significant problem of ocean acidification to marine ecosystems.",

Strategies for promoting change in human-dominated systems may include planting new crops, redesigning road networks, and relocating people. Strategies for fostering change in more natural systems include assisted colonization of threatened plants and animals (see below) and shifting management efforts from one species to another. The outcomes of these more aggressive and forward-looking strategies will be more uncertain, and their implementation will be more controversial. Change is especially hard in social contexts where it is uncomfortable, disadvantageous, expensive, or where the old system is remunerative or beneficial to elites, decision makers, or other small influential groups.",

Adaptive management was conceived for managing highly uncertain systems, and thus it has great potential for managing systems in a changing climate (Arvai et al. 2006) . Adaptive management approaches designed to address climate change will likely have four basic steps (Kareiva et al. 2008) : (1) assessing the potential impacts of climate change on the system in question, (2) designing management actionsin the form of experiments with testable hypotheses or predictionsto address the potential impacts, (3) monitoring the system for climatic changes and system responses, and (4) using the results of the monitoring to evaluate the effectiveness of the management actions and redesign them as necessary before repeating the four steps.",

In some cases, it may be possible to facilitate movement by increasing connectivity of freshwater and terrestrial landscapes (see Sections 4.25.3.2 Freshwater Systems and 4.25.3.3 Terrestrial Systems). However, many species with limited dispersal abilities or that face significant barriers to dispersal will be unable to respond to changing climates. Assisted colonization is one strategy that has been proposed for facilitating climate-driven range shifts (Hunter 2007; McLachlan et al. 2007 ); also referred to as managed relocation and assisted migrationassisted colonization is the translocation of species outside their native range to facilitate movement in response to climate change. The concept is controversial for both ethical and ecological reasons. Some researchers have highlighted the potential for negative, ecological, evolutionary, and economic impacts, as well as ethical concerns (Ricciardi and Simberloff 2009; Sax et al. 2009 ). Advocates argue that assisted colonization will be essential for cases in which species will have to move to find suitable environments but will be unable to do so, that many of the potential risks are overblown, and that guidance can be developed for the strategic and informed use of assisted colonization. Several decision-making frameworks and prioritization strategies for applying assisted colonization have been proposed (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2008; Richardson et al. 2009 ). Although assisted colonization will likely be a useful strategy in many systems, there will be specific factors and risks that will need to be considered for particular systems (e.g., in freshwater systems, Olden et al. 2011 ).",

Consequently, the linear nature of river systems makes them highly prone to fragmentation from waterfalls, dams, and water withdrawals.

Species responses to climate change will be limited by human-engineered structures, including hundreds of thousands of dams, diversions, and impassable road culverts that exist globally (Nilsson and Schopfhauser 1995) . In the United States alone, there are over 80 000 large dams and an estimated 2.5 million or more small impoundments that disrupt the dispersal of aquatic organisms. In recent decades, however, new water laws and programs have helped to increase habitat connectivity by removing or modifying human barriers to movement in river systems. Increasingly, small dams and diversions are being removed for a number of ecological, social, and economic reasons, including the enhancement of longitudinal connectivity for fish migration (Stanley and Doyle 2003) . Similarly, temporary barriers such as impassable culverts under roadways are being modified to allow for easier recolonization and movement of fishes (Roni et al. 2008) . Although this management strategy may promote the adaptive capacity of species to respond to climate change, the removal of such obstructions can simultaneously increase the risk of invasion by nonnative species and associated diseases, which are major threats to ecosystem structure and function. In fact, the conversion of culverts into permanent barriers has been a common management approach to protect isolated native populations from invasive species spreading upstream (Fausch et al. 2009 ). Given the complexities of promoting the movement of native species while concurrently limiting the spread of invasive species, it is unlikely that the removal of barriers to enhance habitat connectivity will be a successful adaptation strategy in all areas for reducing the impacts of climate change on ecosystem function.",

Recent modeling suggests that riparian habitat restoration can play an important role in offsetting the effects of climate change. Battin et al. (2007) used a series of linked models of climate, land cover, hydrology, and salmon population dynamics to investigate the impacts of altered stream flow and temperature on the effectiveness of proposed habitat restoration efforts designed to recover Chinook salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. This study showed that in the absence of habitat restoration, basin-wide spawning populations would decline by an average of 20-40% by 2050. By contrast, they found large increases in juvenile rearing capacity associated with proposed riparian habitat restoration, which limited climate-induced declines to 5% according to one climate model and increased salmon abundance by 19% according to another model. However, the model results showed that not all expected climate impacts could be mitigated entirely. In relatively narrow streams, reforestation was predicted to decrease water temperatures by increasing shading, but in wide, main-stem reaches where most Chinook salmon spawn, riparian vegetation had a minor effect on water temperature. In addition to restoring riparian areas, targeted protection of forested riparian buffers using fencing to stop livestock from entering the stream and trampling/grazing vegetation or conservation easements to eliminate farming activities may also help to reduce stream temperatures.",

Changes in species composition, the timing of ecological events, and the rates of ecosystem processes will result in changes in the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide. Many proposed adaptation strategies address these challenges by augmenting current protected areas with additional reserves, parks, and preserves (Heller and Zavaleta 2009; Lawler 2009 ).

            "text": "In addition to these simple rules of thumb for placing reserves to address climate change, many more sophisticated approaches to selecting areas for new reserves have been proposed. For example, modeled climate-driven shifts in species distributions can be used to select new reserves that will protect biodiversity today and into the future (Hannah et al. 2007; Vos et al. 2008; Hole et al. 2009 ). Although this approach may prove useful for some species and systems, care must be taken in the use of the models developed to project species range shifts. There are many uncertainties associated with the models themselves and the climate projections on which they rely. Another proposed approach to building a reserve network that will be resilient to climate change involves protecting environments in lieu of protecting species and systems. This approach has been referred to as 'protecting the ecological stage.' This analogy implies that the species and the ecological systems are players and that the soils and topography of a region form the stage on which they interact and evolve. By protecting a suite of diverse environments, it is assumed that one will protect the areas where new ecological systems can develop as climates change (Anderson and Ferree 2010; Beier and Brost 2010) . Similarly, others have suggested that more resilient reserve networks will be those that include a diversity of current climates (Pyke and Fischer 2005) . Although climates will change, many of the climate gradients generated by latitudinal and topographic patterns will remain. Thus, a set of reserves that protects a diversity of climates today will likely protect a diversity of climates in the future. At least one recent study has applied the concept of protecting environments (topographies, soils, and climate gradients) to a reserve-selection problem (Schloss et al. 2011) . One last approach to building a resilient reserve network in a changing climate involves placing reserves in areas that are likely to serve as climate refugia. Refugia are areas that are projected to experience minimal climatic changes and/or have cooler microclimates (Saxon et al. 2005; Hansen et al. 2010; Shoo et al. 2011) .",

Traditionally, such corridors have been designed for particular focal species, and they have connected reserves or remaining fragments of habitat. However, corridors that facilitate species ranges shifts and the reshuffling of ecosystems will need to connect what is habitat for a species today with an area that may become habitat in the future. In this way, corridor design will need to evolve to address climate change. One such approach to developing corridors for addressing climate change involves basing the corridors on environmental gradients instead of on the current vegetation (which is often used as a measure of habitat) (Beier and Brost 2010) . Another approach uses projected changes in climate to orient corridors (Ackerly et al. 2010) . A third method involves using modeled shifts in species distributions to identify potential routes that species would need to take to move from currently suitable climates to places where climates will likely be suitable in the future (Williams et al. 2005; Rose and Burton 2009) . These three approaches are based on different assumptions and have different levels of associated uncertainty. In general, the uncertainty increases with the intensity of modeling required to identify the corridor, and thus the first of the three approaches has the least inherent uncertainty and the last of the three has the most.",

Changes in forest harvest practices from clear-cuts to selective, retention harvests can increase the connectivity of forested landscapes. Landscape planning and zoning for residential development can reduce landscape fragmentation. Windbreaks, fencerows, and crop choices can be used to increase the connectivity of agricultural lands.

Fringing coral reefs and mangrove forests buffer wave energy, which reduces erosion along the coast. These systems also provide critical habitat for many species, especially nursery areas for provisional services such as fisheries. In many areas, sea-level rise and associated storm surges will make it difficult to protect these systems and the services they provide. Nonetheless, there are two main approaches that will likely prove most useful in coastal systems: building resilience through protection and restoration and facilitating the transition to new ecosystems.",

Some natural protection features such as sea ice cannot be maintained in the face of increasing temperatures. In Alaska, the loss of sea ice and melting of permafrost due to warming ocean and air temperatures has exposed the shore to wave energy that used to be absorbed or damped by sea ice or frozen soils.

Different zooxanthellae species and different species of corals in general have differential environmental tolerances. For example, some corals near the Arabian Peninsula exist under conditions of salinity and temperature that are greater than near-term predicted future average salinities and temperatures resulting from climate change. These adaptive changes likely operate on a decadal time scale. Thus, in some cases, it may be possible to identify particular species or zooxanthellae and algal combinations that are more resilient to warming. Protecting coral reefs from other stressors such as excess sediment and/or nutrient and pollutant inputs from terrestrial sources and unregulated diving can increase the coral's ability to adapt to increased water temperatures.

Ecosystems will usually adjust to changing salinities and water levels, and the services provided by the system will be maintained where conditions are suitable. For example, in 1996, a subdivision east of Houston in Baytown, Texas, was bought out, the structures removed, and the entire area restored to coastal wetlands. A more extreme example of planned retreat is the Maldive Islands. Their current plan is to exploit the current coastal amenities, primarily beaches and coral reefs; secure capital with which to train younger citizens; and prepare them for relocation to other countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Australia.

Unplanned urban growth will fuel the expansion of informal urban settlements, and by 2050, 3 \u00c2 10 9 people, one-third of the world's population, may inhabit urban slums. In both rural and urban environments, proactive planning and resettlement strategies that identify populations at risk and relocate them stand to drastically reduce long-term human hardship stemming from climate change. They can also protect vital ecosystems from the degradation associated with unplanned development. However, resettlement can have profound negative impacts. Poorly executed, it can degrade indigenous culture, undermine traditional livelihoods, destroy social networks, and deepen poverty by distancing poor communities from employment opportunities. Given these dangers, in some cases, it is preferable to fortify communities against climate change impacts in place.

Water runs from impermeable concrete and asphalt surfaces into storm drains, culverts, and concrete embankments. Rivers are straightened, channelized, and isolated from their natural floodplains to accommodate human settlement. As flood events become more intense and frequent with climate change, storm water management strategies must evolve. Rather than take a defensive stance, they should promote the coexistence of humans, habitat, and water. Soft infrastructure or low-impact development strategies, such as permeable paving, green roofs, green walls, rain gardens, bioswales, and constructed wetlands offer a promising alternative to conventional storm water infrastructure. They promote groundwater recharge, reduce flooding, and improve water quality with downstream benefits to aquatic habitats. In areas of severe flood risk, resettling residents on higher ground and reintroducing rivers to their floodplains protects human populations, dissipates flood energy, and creates wetland habitat. Through temporal landuse practices such as intermittent farming, floods become an asset rather than a threat, depositing sediments that enrich agricultural lands.",

Increasing water storage at scales ranging from dams to urban reservoirs and household rainwater barrels helps bolster water supplies during prolonged dry periods. In coastal areas, desalination plants and, in select localities of South America and Africa, fog harvesting may prove to be viable alternative water sources. Ecological sanitation technologies such as dry toilets and gray water wetlands conserve potable water for drinking and, as part of a network of integrated ecological infrastructure systems, irrigate and provide nutrients for urban farms and forests. They also help prevent contamination of local water bodies, preserving their viability as sources of potable water and ecological integrity.

With increasing global population, the demand for irrigated agriculture will continue to increase globally because realized crop yields normally increase considerably with irrigation. Adaptation strategies that foster more efficient use of water in agriculture will be critical for achieving global food security while conserving water in a changing climate. These strategies will include institutional water management reform, economic incentives for efficient water use, and infrastructure investment for efficient irrigation and water delivery systems (Rosegrant et al. 2009 ). The 'virtual water' trade through crop products from water-abundant to water-deficit areas should be considered as one of the key adaptation options to climate change (Rosegrant et al. 2009; Easterling 2010) . Improving crops for higher water-use efficiency (i.e., greater yield with less water use) should be a goal for genetic, ecological, and agronomic options of adaptation discussed above. Alternative strategies of increasing water storage capacity with dams and increasing the number of stream diversions for agriculture will, in contrast, have significant impacts on aquatic ecosystems (see the Section 4.25.3.5.3 Managed Aquatic Systems).",

Projected climatic changes will likely lead to increased demands for residential use, irrigated agriculture, hydropower production, and carbon capture and storage technologies. In some regions, current water management may not adequately cope with the impacts of changing precipitation regimes and increased evaporation on the reliability of water supply, flood risk, health, agriculture, energy generation, and freshwater ecosystems (Palmer 2008) . Adaptation strategies designed to address water management for human uses will either directly or indirectly affect ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services. In addition to the adaptation strategies for addressing water demands for agriculture and residential use (addressed to some extent in Sections 4.25.3.5.1 and 4.25.3.5.2), other important adaptation strategies for managed aquatic systems that will impact ecosystem functions and services include increased extraction of groundwater, improving storage capacity by building or modifying dams and reservoirs, desalination of seawater, and expansion of rainwater storage and water transfer (Bates et al. 2008; Hirji and Davis 2009) . Improving storage capacity by building or modifying dams and reservoirs is likely to be one of the most common regional responses to decreased water availability and increased demand for water. The great utility of running water has resulted in the extensive exploitation of streams and rivers by humans throughout the world, a process greatly facilitated by the construction of hundreds of thousands of dams globally (Nilsson et al. 2005) . By capturing high river flows and releasing the water in a carefully controlled manner, dam managers can deliver steady and dependable water supplies to downstream areas, protect settlements from floods, or generate power. Although human manipulation of the world's river flows has provided many societal benefits, it has also caused considerable ecological damage and the loss of important ecosystem services valued by society (Baron et al. 2002) . Flow regulation for hydropower and storage, diversion for human use, and extraction of groundwater connected to stream systems often significantly affect the natural seasonal and interannual variation in river flow, commonly referred to as the natural flow regime (Poff et al. 1997) . A natural flow regime is needed to sustain the complex riverine and riparian ecological functions and processes that support native biodiversity and provide myriad ecological services including maintaining water quality, recharging groundwater, and nutrient cycling (Naiman et al. 2002) .",

Human demands for water are expected to increase under a warmer climate, exacerbating current management problems. Increasing demands for irrigation and industrial cooling water could conflict with the increasing demands for municipal water supplies resulting from urban growth. Climate-induced changes to water availability and increasing human demand for water are likely to prompt the construction or modification of dams and reservoirs to improve storage capacity and enhance water security (WCD 2000; Palmer 2008 ). For instance, by storing water in reservoirs, water managers capture high flows during wet years or seasons to supplement water supplies at drier times, thereby maximizing the reliability of water supplies and certain economic benefits each year. For regions where increases in runoff variability or more prolonged drought conditions are associated with climate change, the pressure to build watersupply reservoirs will be great.",

River ecosystem health deteriorates when natural flows of water, sediments, and organic materials through a river system are substantially disrupted or modified by human activities (Poff et al. 1997; Richter et al. 2003) . River damming and associated environmental alteration is now widely recognized as a leading cause of declines in freshwater biodiversity globally (Bunn and Arthington 2002) . Dams have also been implicated in the loss of commercial fisheries in many estuaries and coastal areas, and in the degradation of other natural ecosystem products and services worldwide (WCD 2000) . In addition, reservoirs increase the loss of water due to evaporation.

Countries in the Global South argue that northern countries have already developed their economies relying on fossil fuel consumption and now, when it is their turn to develop, they are asked to put restrictions on their energy consumption and natural resource use. Meanwhile, the United States has used the reluctance of developing countries to cap emissions as an excuse for inaction on its part.

While trends over the past several decades suggest that population growth is a significant driver of CO 2 emissions (Bongaarts 1992; Dietz and Rosa 1997) , it is also true that urbanization, aging, and changes in household size similarly affect energy use and emissions (MacKeller et al. 1995; Cole and Neumayer 2004) . Particular point sources of GHG emissions from energy consumption in developed countries, like the internationally managed oil fields of Nigeria or emissions from the recent Iraq war, which since 2003 has released over 140 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of adding 25 million new cars to American roads (Reisch and Kretzmann 2008) , should bear at least as much scrutiny as the desires of third world women and men to bear children.

Disparities in climate change risk and human health often overlap, and human health and environmental health are intricately intertwined. Although diseases are often approached as singular phenomena, good models exist that demonstrate the interactive effects of multiple morbidity factors on health outcomes and disease trajectories. For example, interactions between acquired immune deficiency syndrome and tuberculosis, or diabetes and severe acute respiratory syndrome, have synergistic impacts on patients that must be understood together. Likewise, social attributes, like poverty or exposure to racism, interact with disease conditions to increase the damaging effects of disease. Such interactions have the potential to influence the effects of climate change on disease movement and clustering, disease interactions, and the impact of climate change on global health (Baer and Singer 2008) . Human action and human vulnerability to such interactions between climate, disease, and the environment are structured by social and economic inequality, and thus mitigation and adaptation strategies will need to take these inequalities into account.",

Suggested approaches to either mitigation or adaptation will involve costs and benefits that are unequally distributed across nations, populations, and societies. There will, for example, always be those who can escape pollution with air filters and private vehicles, use air conditioning to survive heat waves, have access to global food markets and multiple water sources, and those who cannot. The most effective mitigation and adaptation strategies, therefore, will address both climate change and environmental justice.",
