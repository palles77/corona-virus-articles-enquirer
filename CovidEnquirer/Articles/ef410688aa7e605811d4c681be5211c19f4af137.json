            "text": "Two common viral pathogens of swine, namely, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), were investigated in regard to their effects on monolayer cultures of swine alveolar macrophages (AMs). The purpose was to identify selected cellular changes and responses potentially associated with the clinical reactions of pigs infected with either or both of these viruses. Measurements included the (1) absolute and relative numbers of infected, viable, and apoptotic cells; (2) distribution of viral antigens; (3) levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-a) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) produced and their association with the extent of virus-induced cytopathology. Four groups of AMs were studied, including mock-infected, PCV2 alone-infected (PCV2-A), PRRSV alone-infected (PRRSV-A), and PCV2 and PRRSV dually infected (PCV2/PRRSV) groups. The AMs of PCV2-A group had high antigen-containing rate without cell death. There was a marked increase in cell death and apoptosis in PRRSV-A group. However, a lower PRRSVinduced infectious rate, cell death, and apoptosis were seen in PCV2/PRRSV group. High levels of IFN-a production were detected in PCV2-infected groups, but not in mock-infected and PRRSV-A groups. The PRRSV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) on MARC-145 cells or swine AMs was markedly reduced by pre-incubation of the cells with UV-treated or non-UVtreated supernatants of PCV2-infected AMs. In addition, the reduction in CPE was abolished when the supernatants of PCV2-infected AMs were pre-treated with a mouse anti-recombinant porcine IFN-a antibody. The results suggest that swine AMs were an important reservoir of PCV2; PCV2 infection reduced PRRSV infection and PRRSV-associated CPE in PCV2/ PRRSV AMs; the reduction of PRRSV infection in AMs was mediated by IFN-a generated by PCV2 infection.

Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) alone has been demonstrated to induce PMWS in gnotobiotic (Ellis et al., 1999) , cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived (CD/CD) , and specific pathogen-free (SPF) (Magar et al., 2000) pigs. However, experimental infection with PCV2 alone only produced minimal symptoms and mild bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia Bolin et al., 2001; Ellis et al., 1999; Magar et al., 2000) . Pigs with PMWS often had concurrent infection with porcine parvovirus (PPV) (Choi and Chae, 2000) , porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) (Segal\u00e9s et al., 2002) , or Aujeszky's disease virus (PRV) (Quintana et al., 2001) . Experimental dual infection of PCV2 and PRRSV-induced PMWS in CD/CD pigs that had more severe interstitial pneumonia and enhanced replication and distribution of PCV2 in the tissues Harms et al., 2001) . These findings, therefore, suggest that the development of full-blown PMWSinduced clinical symptoms and pathological lesions requires other porcine pathogens as the co-factors.",

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are essential defense cells in the lungs. However, there is no study addressing the effects of dual infection of PCV2 and PRRSV on swine AMs. Interferon-alpha (IFN-a) and/or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) have been shown to possess anti-viral activity (Vilcek and Sen, 1996; Wong and Goeddel, 1986) . Porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)-induced IFN-a was shown to interfere with PRRSV replication in the lungs of pigs, but PRRSV infection has little or no effect on the replication of PRCV in porcine lungs (Buddaert et al., 1998) . Currently, the interaction between PCV2 and PRRSV in swine AMs and the production of cytokines associated with individual or dual infection are unclear. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of PCV2 and/or PRRSV infection on swine AMs regarding infectious rate, cell viability, apoptosis, production of IFN-a and TNF-a, and the role of IFN-a and TNF-a in the interaction.",

In addition, PCV2 antigen is predominantly and persistently present in the cytoplasm of infected AMs. Such findings were consistent with others that despite the presence of persistent infectious virus, viral antigen, and viral DNA, there was no detectable viral replication and cellular injury in PCV2-infected swine AMs (Gilpin et al., 2003) and monocyte-or bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (Vincent et al., 2003) . It has been suggested that PCV2 may enter dendritic cells by endocytosis rather than active infection (Vincent et al., 2003) . In the present study, scattered pinpoint to small granular positive signals were detected as early as 1 h after the inoculation of either non-UV-treated or UVinactivated PCV2 and the signal intensity in both groups increased with time in a similar pattern (data not shown). This indicated that PCV2 could indeed passively enter and accumulate in the cytoplasm of AMs. Antigens of PCV2 detected in AMs might result from active infection and passive endocytosis and/or phagocytosis. Thus, MPS lineage cells may function as an important reservoir to help PCV2 evade the immunosurveillance and also assist PCV2 to spread.",

As seen in a previous study (Chiou et al., 2000) and the present study, PRRSV-infected AMs had a low but constant infectious rate between 5 and 10%, markedly reduced cell viability, and significantly increased apoptosis and TNF-a production. Currently, available data suggest that the low PRRSV infectious rate but prominent cell injury in AMs might well be the result of a non-viral indirect mechanism due to the bystander effect of the released PRRSV open reading frame 5 gene product (Suarez et al., 1996) or TNF-a (Choi and Chae, 2002) from the infected cells. In the present study, significantly elevated TNF-a production occurred in all PCV2 and/or PRRSV-infected groups, particularly in the PRRSV-A group. Co- infection of PCV2 and PRRSV is often seen in PMWS-affected pigs Segal\u00e9s et al., 2002) . Compared to PRRSV infection alone, simultaneous PCV2 and PRRSV infection caused variable degrees of reduction in the PRRSV-associated infectious rate, cell death, and apoptosis of swine AMs. Such findings might have resulted from decrease in the infectivity and/or replication of PRRSV. A prior PRCV infection could interfer the subsequent swine influenza virus (SIV) replication in the lungs of pigs, characterized by markedly reduced nasal excretion and pulmonary infection of SIV; the PRCV-induced anti-viral activities were suggested due to the IFN-a and TNF-a released in the lungs (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994a,b) . A similar anti-viral effect may also be present in PCV2-infected groups as evidenced by high levels of IFN-a detected shortly after PCV2 infection in all PCV2-infected groups in the present study. The result indicates that PCV2 is a potent IFN-a inducer for swine AMs and the released IFN-a may contribute to the anti-viral effects to PRRSV in PCV2/ PRRSV group.",

            "text": "Induction of type I IFNs by most RNA viruses is initiated by virus-derived double-stranded RNA produced during replication (Vilcek and Sen, 1996) . For retro-, DNA-, and some RNA viruses, the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with host cell membrane serves as an alternative mechanism of IFN induction (Ankel et al., 1998; Capobianchi et al., 1992; Charley and Laude, 1988) . PCV2 is a nonenveloped DNA virus and possesses a small and circular genome, which is quite similar to the plasmid DNA. The relatively high content of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in plasmid DNA is known for its immunostimulatory activity in vertebrates, including cytokine production (Tighe et al., 1998) . A recent study has shown that one out of five oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) with central CpG motifs selected from the genome of PCV2 exhibited an inhibitory activity in IFN-a production in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), while the other four had a stimulatory effect; this inhibitory ODN also showed a complete or variable inhibitory action on other stimulatory ODNs or known inducers of IFN-a, respectively, and this particular genomic sequence was speculated to be associated with the immunosuppressive effect of PCV2 (Hasslung et al., 2003) . Our data of IFN-a induction by intact infectious PCV2 or UV-inactivated PCV2 in swine AMs, however, clearly displayed a strong stimulatory activity. The discrepancy may be explained by the observation that the position of the inhibitory sequence in relation to a stimulatory sequence on the same strand of DNA is considered of importance with respect to the net effect of the ODN (Yamada et al., 2002) . Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of IFN-a induction by PCV2.",
