            "text": "A new porcine coronavirus SADS-CoV was recently identified from suckling piglets 20 with severe diarrhea in southern China and its genome sequence is most identical (~95% 21 identity) to that of bat \u03b1-coronavirus HKU2. It again indicates bats are the natural 22 reservoir of many coronaviruses that have great potential for cross-species transmission 23 to animals and humans by recombination and/or mutation. Here we report the cryo-EM 24 structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 \u00c5 and 2.83 \u00c5 25 resolution, respectively. HKU2 and SADS-CoV spikes exhibit very high structural 26 similarity, with subtle differences mainly distributed in the NTD and CTD of the S1 27 subunit responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. We systematically 28 analyzed and compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and 29 the S2 subunit of HKU2 spike with those of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-coronavirus spikes. The 30 results show that the NTD and CTD of HKU2/SADS-CoV are probably the most 31 ancestral in the evolution of spike. Although the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion 32 is highly conserved, the connecting region after fusion peptide in HKU2/SADS-CoV 33 S2 subunit also adopts a conformation distinct from other coronaviruses. These results 34 structurally demonstrate a close evolutionary relationship between HKU2 /SADS-CoV 35 and \u03b2-coronavirus spikes and provide new insights into the evolution and cross-species 36 transmission of coronaviruses. : bioRxiv preprint 39 Coronaviruses, categorized into the order Nidovirales family Coronaviridae and 40 subfamily Coronavirinae, are a large group of viral pathogens with a wide host range 1 . 41 Their infections in humans, other mammals and birds can cause respiratory, hepatic, 42 enteric and neurological diseases with varying severity 2 . The severe acute respiratory 43 syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 44 (MERS-CoV) have posed severe threats to human health in the 21 st century 1,3 . In the 45 meantime, coronaviruses infecting domestic animals also bring substantial economic 46 losses 4 . For example, the swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) 47 (also known as SeACoV and PEAV) isolated in 2017 caused outbreaks of severe watery 48 diarrhea of suckling piglets with a mortality up to 90% in several commercial pig farms 49 in Guangdong Province of China 5-10 . SADS-CoV is an \u03b1-coronavirus and other 50 representative members in the \u03b1-genus are porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 51 (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), porcine respiratory 52 coronavirus (PRCV), human NL63 and 229E coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-53 229E) 1 . Representative members in other three genera include mouse hepatitis 54 coronavirus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-55 OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 in the \u03b2-genus, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in the 56 \u03b3-genus and porcine deltacoronavirus (PdCoV) in the \u03b4-genus 1 . 57 Cross-species transmission promoted by genetic recombination and/or mutations 58 underlies the host range expansion of coronaviruses 3,11-13 . Bats are the natural reservoir 59 of more than 30 different \u03b1-and \u03b2-coronaviruses that have great potential for 60 interspecies transmission by recombination and/or mutation 12,14-16 . Data on genetic 61 evolution, receptor binding and pathogenesis have demonstrated that human SARS-62 CoV and MERS-CoV most likely originate from bats 1 . Palm civets and dromedary 63 camels are the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV from bats to humans 1 , 64",

            "text": "However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the transmission of SADS-CoV from 68 bats to pigs are still unknown and need to be further explored. Recently it was shown 69 that SADS-CoV is able to infect cells from a broad range of species including mouse, 70 chicken, pig, monkey and human, indicating a high potential of the SADS-CoV for 71 interspecies transmission 17 . 72 The spike glycoprotein of coronaviruses mediates viral entry by binding host 73 receptor with the S1 subunit and fusing viral and cellular membranes with the S2 74 subunit, thereby determining viral host range and tissue tropism 18, 19 . As a class I viral 75 fusion protein, the spike exists on the envelope of virion as a homotrimer and each 76 monomer contains more than 1000 amino acid residues that can be cleaved into S1 and 77 S2 subunits 18 . For most coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit HCoV-OC43 utilizes NTD to recognize glycans 29 ; and one exception is MHV, which 83 utilizes the NTD to bind mouse receptor CEACAM1a 30 . Therefore, the S1 subunit, 84 especially its NTD and CTD, is the most variable region of the spike, and is responsible 85 for different tropisms of coronaviruses. In comparison, the S2 subunit containing the 86 fusion peptide (FP) and heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) for membrane fusion are more 87 conserved in both sequence and structure 18, 19 . For the SADS-CoV, receptor analysis 88 indicated that none of the known coronavirus protein receptors including ACE2, DPP4 89 and APN are essential for the cell entry 7,17 .

The cryo-99 EM structures of bat coronavirus spike trimers have not been reported, and only crystal 100 structures of the CTD from HKU4 44 , HKU5 45 and HKU9 46 were determined. 101 The spikes of SADS-CoV (1130 amino acid residues) and HKU2 (1128 amino 102 acid residues) are the shortest among all known coronavirus spike glycoproteins and 103 their amino acid identities to other known coronavirus spikes are lower than 28%, 104 indicating the spikes of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are unique [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 47 . In this study, we report 105 the cryo-EM structures of the SADS-CoV and HKU2 spike trimers at 2.83 \u00c5 and 2.38 106 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The HKU2 spike trimer structure is the first one from bat 107 coronavirus. We analyzed the HKU2 and SADS-CoV trimer structures and also 108 compared the NTD, CTD, SD1 and SD2 domains of the S1 subunit and the S2 subunit ",

The NTD1 of \u03b1-coronavirus 193 PEDV is not completely modeled in the spike trimer structure, however the partial194 model still fits well with the NTD of HKU2 with an r.m.s.d. of 2.3 \u00c5 for 73 aligned C\u03b1 195 atoms. Both HCoV-NL63 and PEDV have a second NTD (NTD2, also named domain 196 A in previous reports), and the NTD of HKU2 is structurally less similar to the NTD2 197 with an r.m.s.d. of 4.3 \u00c5 against HCoV-NL63 NTD2 and of 4.1 \u00c5 against PEDV NTD2 198 (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 7d). Recent structural determination showed that 199 another \u03b1-coronavirus, HCoV-229E, also has one NTD, which is more structurally 200 similar to the NTD2 (C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. of 2.0 \u00c5) than the NTD1 (C\u03b1 r.m.s.d. of 3.7 \u00c5) of 201 HCoV-NL63 (Fig. 2b). All above comparisons indicate that there are two subtypes of 202 NTD in the \u03b1-coronaviruses: the subtype I represented by the NTDs of HKU2 and 203 SADS-CoV and the NTD1s of HCoV-NL63 and PEDV, and the subtype II represented 204 by the NTD of HCoV-229E and the NTD2s of HCoV-NL63 and PEDV (Fig. 2b). 205 Although sharing an overall architecture, these two NTD subtypes have a structural 206 difference in the galectin-like \u03b2-sandwich fold containing the top and middle sheets 207 stacked together through hydrophobic interactions. These two \u03b2 sheets are well aligned 208 in the galectin-like domain of subtype I, whereas there is an alignment shift in the 209 galectin-like domain of subtype II (Fig. 2b).

The SADS-CoV and HKU2 are phylogenetically located in a 341 sub-lineage closely related to the proposed \uf061-coronavirus group-1b lineage at the 342 complete genome level 5-10 . However, phylogenetic analysis based on the spike 343 glycoprotein indicated that they are members of a separate lineage clustered within \uf062-344 coronavirus (Supplementary Fig. 7a), suggesting that HKU2 and SADS-CoV probably 345 resulted from recombination of an \uf061-coronavirus with an unrecognized \uf062-coronavirus 346 S gene 5-10 . These results, together with the lower than 28% amino acid identities to 347 other known coronavirus glycoproteins, strongly indicate that the spike glycoproteins 348 of HKU2 and SADS-CoV are unique 5-10 . In this study, we determined the cryo-EM 349 structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike glycoproteins at atomic resolutions. Pairwise 350 comparisons demonstrated nearly identical overall structures, and differences mainly 351 locate in the loops of NTD and CTD of the S1 subunit between the spikes of HKU2 and 352 SADS-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 5). A series of structural analysis and comparisons 353 were also performed at the domain level between HKU2 spike with other coronavirus 354 spikes with determined structures.

These \uf062-coronavirus NTDs 373 also have additional loop ceiling over the top sheet, functionally facilitating immune 374 evasion or binding protein receptor such as in MHV 30 .

In the evolutionary aspect, it is 408 not surprising because this region either connects the CTD to the S2 subunit (SD1 and 409 SD2) or mediates the membrane fusion, whereas the NTD and CTD are key factors 410 determining tissue tropism and host range of coronaviruses 20 . Even highly conserved 411 in overall structure, the S2 subunit in HKU2 and SADS-CoV still have a secondary 412 structure arrangement in the connecting region (CR) after the fusion peptide (FP), 413resulting in a more buried S2' cleavage site(Fig. 6c).
