Here, we report that lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells are involved in the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Infectivity assay showed the integrity of lipid rafts was required for productive infection of pseudotyped SARS-CoV. Depletion of plasma membrane cholesterol with MbCD relocalized raft-resident marker caveolin-1 as well as SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 to a nonraft environment, but did not significantly change the surface expression of ACE2. MbCD-treatment inhibited infectivity of pseudotyped SARS-CoV by 90%. Biochemical fractionation and confocal imaging confirmed that ACE2 colocalized with raft-resident markers. Furthermore, an ectodomain of SARS-CoV S protein (S1188HA) could associate with lipid rafts after binding to its receptor, and colocalize with raft-resident marker ganglioside GM1. The binding of S1188HA was not affected by depleting plasma membrane cholesterol. Taken together, our results support that lipid rafts serve as an entry port for SARS-CoV.",

            "text": "In addition to the demonstrated physiological roles in signal transduction of host cells [1, 3] , lipid rafts often serve as a site for entry, assembly and budding of microbial pathogens [4] [5] [6] . Recent studies have implicated lipid rafts in the entry process of HIV-1 [7] , simian virus 40 [8] . There was also some evidence that lipid rafts are involved in coronavirus entry. In the case of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), virus entry was inhibited by depletion of cholesterol, resulting in the disruption of viral association with the cellular receptor, CD13 [9] . Thorp and Gallagher [10] showed that lipid rafts were crucial for the entry of MHV. SARS-CoV is a novel coronavirus discovered in association with cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Although the detailed mechanism remains to be determined, the early step in the entry process of SARS-CoV into target cells is initiated by engagement of its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by the spike (S) glycoprotein [11] . The African green monkey kidney cell, Vero E6 cell, is a cell line that permits replication of SARS-CoV. It provides a useful reagent to examine the yet undetermined roles of lipid rafts in SARS-CoV entry process. Here, we report that SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is localized in lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells and the productive entry of SARS-CoV pseudovirus into Vero E6 cells requires the presence of intact lipid rafts.

[20] found that various proteases, such as trypsin are effective in inducing fusion of SARS-CoVinfected Vero E6 cells. So SARS-CoV has the potential to enter host cells via two different pathways, either an endosomal or a non-endosomal pathway, depending on the presence of proteases. In either of these pathways, only S protein bound to its receptor and cleaved by proteases could obtain fusion activity. The distribution of its receptors plays important roles in its entry.",

We demonstrated that ACE2 was largely colocalized with raft marker caveolin-1 and GM1. Our results are different from the results of Turner's group [17] . They found that ACE2 is not raft-localized in CHO Cells. By now whether the raft localization of ACE2 is cell type specific has not been confirmed yet. Our results show that ACE2 was shifted to the nonraft environment after depletion of cholesterol. Using single-cycle infectivity assay, we also found that depletion of cholesterol from cell membranes resulted in 90% reduction of the luciferase activity in cells infected with SARS-CoV pseudovirus but not VSV pseudovirus. Furthermore, the cell surface expression of ACE2 and the binding of S protein ectodomain to Vero E6 cells did not change significantly after cholesterol depletion. The results eliminate the possibility that MbCD inhibits viral entry by down regulating the receptor, and subsequently deceasing the virus binding. All the evidence suggests that raft integrity is crucial for productive entry of SARS-CoV pseudovirus into Vero E6 cells and specific concentration of ACE2 in lipid rafts may explain why SARS-CoV selects these microdomains for entry. The preferential association of an ectodomain of S protein with lipid rafts further supports our hypothesis that SARS-CoV receptor localizes in these microdomains and represents the population of membrane receptor engaged in virus binding and entry.",

            "text": "How does lipid rafts affect the efficiency of SARS-CoV entry and productive infection? Coronaviruses enter the host cells either by direct membrane fusion with the plasma membrane or by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Membrane fusion is a cooperative process, and lipid rafts concentrate components of the membrane docking and fusion machinery for endocytosis [21] , such as actin polymerization [22] which is important for the membrane fusion and endocytosis. An increased concentration of these proteins in rafts facilitates their intermolecular interactions by proximity. Nicolau et al. [23] used a stochastic spatial model of the plasma membrane to investigate the role of lipid rafts in signal transduction. Their results showed that partitioning of protein into rafts increases specific interprotein collision rates. Thus, rafts serve as membrane ''reaction vessels\", increasing the chance for two specific proteins of low concentration to meet on the membrane and in turn, increasing the collision rate to increase the efficiency of membrane reactions. In the case of SARS-CoV, lipid rafts could provide a convenient platform to concentrate receptor ACE2 as clusters on host cell membrane to dock efficiently with the spike protein on viral envelope. The finding that CD209 L (L-SIGN), a C-type lection-associated with lipid rafts serving as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV [24] , lends further support to our view. Induced by virus binding, lipid rafts are aggregated as a reaction platform by the stimulation of signaling pathways emanating from these microdomains to facilitate the sequential incorporation and fusion process.",
