Hepatosplenomegaly had been present continuously since then. Numerous antimicrobials had been tried and found ineffective, including isoniazid, para-aminosalicylate, ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin, capriomycin, erthyromycin, ethionamine, rifampin, levamisole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and pyrimidine.

The computerized tomographic scan also showed an unexpectedly large left kidney with hydronephrosis. A subsequent excretory urogram verified the left hydronephrosis and a normal right kidney, ureter and bladder. Retrograde pyelography revealed the source of the left pyelocaliectasis to be a 2.5 cm. long stricture of the left mid ureter (see figure) .

Postmortem pathologic examination revealed diffuse foci of atypical mycobacteria with poorly organized cellular rection. Organisms were present in both kidneys and in the strictured region of the left ureter. DISCUSSION The table summarizes the findings in 14 cases, including our own, of atypical mycobacterial genitourinary involvement. As indicated in the table information concerning some of these cases is scant. In others, such as those reported by Lester,6 and Lattimer and Boyes, 7 culture of M. kansasii in the urine was not associated with evidence of urinary tract disease. This is significant in that mycobacterial colonization and infection appear not to be synonymous. In 1970 Klotz noted 306 cases of urinary colonization with atypical mycobacteria, none of which was reportedly associated with observable urinary tract disease.8 Thus, we believe that adequate documentation of atypical mycobacterial infection must include either positive culture of genitourinary tissue specimens and/ or positive urine cultures in conjunction with some combination of radiologic, pathologic or laboratory evidence compatible with granulomatous genitourinary disease. In view ofKlotz's study the occurrence of these spinal fluid, lymph nodes, liver, bone marrow, blood combinations of findings would seem exceedingly rare.",

            "text": "Several facets of our case are uncommon with respect to those previously reported. The patient was only 14 years old. Lattimer and Boyes referred to 2 children in whom urine culture yielded group I atypical mycobacteria but no supporting evidence of genitourinary disease was found. 7 In no other reported case was a patient <27 years old. 9 In discussing the reasons for the rarity of urinary tuberculosis in children, Ehrlich and Lattimer have cited the usual lag between initial cortical dissemination and clinical or radiologic manifestations. 10 Our patient possessed a defect in cellular immunity, which may have hastened the progression of the disease. While decreased immunocompetence appears to have a critical role in our case this is not generally true of others in the literature. Of the 13 cases reported only 2 had a recognized immune deficiency, which was an unexplained pancytopenia. 4 \u2022 11 Pancytopenia has been described in other instances of disseminated mycobacterial infections as well but it is not ascertained whether this represents cause or effect of this disease. 12 Finally, the radiographic manifestations of our case are typical of those usually associated with genitourinary tuberculosis. Although Pseudomonas superinfection was present it is not reasonable to expect that this was responsible for renal nonfunction and the exceedingly long left ureteral stricture. Rather, the length and irregularity of the stricture are characteristic of granulomatous infection and healing, while the renal non-function may be attributed to obstruction and/or the effects of diffuse renal parenchymal infection. 11 The postmortem examination, revealing the presence of atypical mycobacteria in the kidneys and region of the ureteral stricture, supports this contention.",
