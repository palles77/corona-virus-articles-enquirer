The cortex was isolated under a dissecting microscope and carefully cleaned of choroid plexus and meninges. Cell suspensions were filtered through 80 /zm pore size mesh into Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and gentamicin (Flow Laboratories, U.K.). After centrifugation, cells were filtered through a 20 #m mesh sieve, plated in 75 cm -~ tissue culture flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA, U.S.A.) and cultured at 37 \u00b0 C. The medium was changed after 4 days of culture and, subsequently, 3 times a week for the entire culture period. Cultures were enriched in astrocytes by removal of less adherent oligodendrocytes by shaking for 18 h at 37 \u00b0 C and 250 rpm in an orbital shaker. Cellular confluence was observed 10 days after plating with a polygonal fiat cell morphology. The content of a mean of 98.4% astrocytes was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining of methanol-fixed cultures using rabbit anti-gliaI fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antiserum (Dakopatts, Denmark) and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit lgG (Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN, U.S.A.). The lack of noticeable oligodendrocytcs and microglial/macrophage cells was determined by using a guinea pig anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) antiserum prepared by ourselves (Rubio and Cuesta, 1989 ) and a monoclonal anti-Mac-1 antibody (Serotec, Oxford, U.K.).
