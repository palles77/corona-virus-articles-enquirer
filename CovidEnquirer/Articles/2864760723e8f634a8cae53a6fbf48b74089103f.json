            "text": "Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is mechanical ventilatory support delivered to the airways in the absence of invasive devices such as an endotracheal tube or tracheotomy cannula. The most common devices used to establish the ventilatorpatient interface are nasal, oronasal, and full face masks, along with nasal pillows and helmets. The role of NIV has grown steadily in recent years, and in expert hands, it now represents an extremely valuable tool for the management of acute respiratory failure (ARF). The key factors in successful use of NIV are proper patient selection and a high level of competence and experience in both medical and adjunctive personnel on the respiratory care team. It has been shown that in the appropriate setting, NIV is effective in improving gas exchange and alveolar ventilation, as well as in avoiding intubation in patients with ARF. A role for this ventilatory mode also has been proposed in the management of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), although its use is associated with more controversial results.",

In addition, NIV can be performed outside the intensive care unit (ICU)-for example, in step-down units or the emergency department, or on respiratory care wards. On the other hand, it is obvious that NIV cannot guarantee the level of airway control provided by invasive ventilation in terms of leak avoidance, effective delivery of flow and pressure to the airways, and control of minute ventilation. Accurate positioning of the interface device is crucial to minimize air leaks, and patients should be constantly monitored for timely detection of signs of worsening that may necessitate a prompt switch to invasive ventilation.",

Moreover, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi) often is present, as a result of the nonreversible airflow limitation. PEEPi places a further burden on inspiratory muscles, because it has to be overcome before a negative alveolar pressure, necessary to the initiation of inspiratory airflow, can be generated. The contraction of the diaphragm initially is isometric, and only after PEEPi has been counterbalanced can chest expansion begin. The combined effect of increased work of breathing and loss of contractile efficiency places the diaphragm at risk for development of fatigue, a precursor to acute alveolar hypoventilation with hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. The first studies on the role of noninvasive ventilation in patients with COPD experiencing acute hypercapnic respiratory failure were conducted in the late 1980s. Since then, several controlled randomized studies have shown that NIV added to standard medical treatment is effective in reducing mortality, avoiding intubation, relieving dyspnea, and reducing length of hospital stay in patients with COPD with acute respiratory failure when compared with medical management plus oxygen therapy alone.",

These findings point to the need for an early and accurate differentiation between patient subgroups on the basis of severity of illness, to allow prompt initiation of the most effective treatment. Patients with mild to moderate acidosis can receive NIV in hospital units outside the ICU, so long as they are staffed with trained personnel. More severely affected patients can still undergo a NIV trial, but only under strict management in an ICU setting, where they can be intubated with no delay in case signs of failure become apparent. Patients treated with NIV, irrespective of their initial severity status, had lower rates of infectious complications (ventilator-associated pneumonia, sepsis). A recent prospective study conducted in the United Kingdom in 9716 inpatients with COPD exacerbation and ARF managed in general clinical practice showed an overall mortality rate of 25% for patients receiving NIV-significantly higher than rates reported in the randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The study pointed to several potential explanations, including inaccurate selection of candidate patients for NIV, including, in some cases, patients with mixed acidosis or prevailing metabolic acidosis; the use of NIV as a \"ceiling\" of treatment in subjects with very severe disease; and substantial delays in initiating the ventilatory treatment. In addition, patients with mild acidosis (those in which the effectiveness of NIV is higher) appeared to be a minority among the overall group and often do not receive NIV at all. These results highlight the need for better implementation, in general clinical practice, of proper use of NIV in accordance with the evidence gathered from the RCTs.",

The choice of the appropriate interface is crucial to ensure the success of the treatment and patient compliance. In general, the nasal mask is better tolerated by patients, because it allows expectoration and creates less overall discomfort and is associated with less subjective claustrophobia. In acutely ill patients, face masks usually are preferred over nasal masks by most clinicians, because they provide better control of air leaks, especially in view of the difficulty of breathing exclusively through the nose for patients with acute respiratory failure. In fact, leak control is a key determinant of success for NIV, because it has been shown that air leaks represent the single most important cause of patientventilator asynchrony, even when such leaks are relatively modest. On the other hand, placement of nasal or oronasal masks should never be too tight, to prevent development of severe pressure skin lesions, especially frequent across the bridge of the nose, and to improve tolerability. The marked difference in internal volume associated with different interfaces does not usually affect NIV outcome in terms of clinical response and gas exchange variables, when the treatment is delivered by an experienced staff, as shown by a randomized prospective study that compared full face masks, oronasal masks of various sizes, and mouthpieces.",

A study performed in three European ICUs with considerable expertise with NIV clarifies the issue of \"real-life\" use of NIV in this setting. This study showed that only 16.5% of patients admitted with ARDS can be successfully treated with this technique. In two years' time, 479 patients were hospitalized for this disorder, a large majority of whom (69%) were already intubated at admission, so that only 147 were eligible for the study. NIV improved gas exchange and avoided intubation in 54% of this subset of patients, for an overall success rate of less than 20%. In these patients NIV was associated with less ventilator-associated pneumonia and a lower ICU mortality rate (6% versus 53%). It should be noted, however, that the study was conducted in three ICUs with solid expertise with NIV. In summary, the use of NIV as an alternative to invasive ventilation in severely hypoxemic patients generally is not advisable and should be limited to hemodynamically stable patients who can be closely monitored in an ICU.",

            "text": "Despite the growing evidence for a role for NIV in the management of ARF, still unresolved are a few questions concerning its optimal utilization in clinical practice. The main controversy concerns the safety of NIV when applied outside the ICU setting, specifically in emergency departments and on regular wards. Although some evidence shows that NIV can be performed with good results in regular respiratory wards, the limiting factor for its success is the availability of specifically trained staff (doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists). Such availability is far from consistent across hospitals and countries, so the experiences of different groups often are difficult to compare and to generalize. Availability of skilled and experienced staff is obviously crucial for proper patient selection and monitoring, appropriate handling of the equipment, and timely recognition of signs of worsening that might require escalation to invasive ventilation.The same observations apply in the emergency department, where most patients with ARF who could potentially benefit from NIV initially are evaluated. In fact, many of these patients, for logistical reasons (such as shortage of ICU beds), first receive NIV in this setting, where monitoring is critical for ensuring success, because a delay in switching from noninvasive to invasive ventilation when necessary may result in increased mortality. Accordingly, knowledge and proper evaluation of the predictors of NIV outcome are extremely important.As indicated by the foregoing considerations, the effectiveness of NIV is strictly dependent on location of implementation, timing, and staff training. Its success or failure will therefore depend on careful, case-by-case judgment that is firmly rooted in the reality of the available resources.",

Moreover, NIV is no longer confined to the ICU, but in expert hands, it has crossed ever more often into the regular ward, thus broadening the spectrum of options available for the treatment of respiratory failure. Current research is focusing on improving the quality and safety of the devices and establishing new ventilatory modes to extend even further the indications for use of NIV, as well as improving its rate of success.
