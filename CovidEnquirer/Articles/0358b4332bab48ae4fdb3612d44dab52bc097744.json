The investigations of these arthritis models have so far been focused mainly on the immune responses to the injected antigens, and the role of the oily adjuvant has been considered in more detail in only a few cases. In the most extensive study of this kind, Whitehouse et al. [3] examined many different oily vehicles for their co-arthritogenic and adjuvant activity together with Mycobacteria tuberculosis in rats, and found that several hydrocarbon compounds were very effective adjuvants. No indication was, however, provided in this paper of whether the oily compounds could induce arthritis without the addition of antigens.",

Furthermore, pristane oil could also induce arthritis, whereas neither of two tested vegetable oils were arthritogenic. These results indicate that the arthritogenic compounds may possess properties unique to particular classes of chemical compounds. These findings also indicate that the capacity of an oil alone to induce arthritis in DA rats parallels the capacity of this oil to act as a good adjuvant together with other agents, for example in inducing AA [3] . Thus, Whitehouse [ 1 l] reported.that linear alkanes, many esters and triglycerides of fatty acids with a chain length of Cl2 or more and acetates of vitamins E, K and A are compounds with common adjuvant activity. In both cases the exact function of the oily vehicle, the adjuvant is unknown, although FIA is known to stimulate macrophages, promote uptake of antigen and enhance antibody formation, but not to induce cell-mediated immunity [ 121.",

These observations are compatible with the presence of an early acute type of inflammation, which is followed by a more chronic phase where the presence of multinucleated giant cells indicates pronounced macrophage activation. Involvement of lymphocytes, i.e., specific immunity, in the development of oil-induced arthritis is also indicated by the facts that the arthritis is first seen about 14 days after injection of oil, and that arthritis cannot be induced after a second injection of oil; a similar specific resistance to reinduction of disease is observed in many autoimmune diseases which depend on reactivity to defined autoantigens [see for example 131. The fact that repeated injections of an antigen in FIA, for example booster immunizations, do not cause general immunosuppression supports the explanation that the observed resistance to disease is dependant on specific changes in the immune system, rather than unspecific suppression.",

With respect to the latter, both AA and CIA in DA rats differ from the oil-induced arthritis in being more destructive (both AA and CIA) and in being more chronic and involving more peripheral joints (CIA) [ 151. In these cases it thus appears that induction of specific immune reactions to mycobacteria or type II collagen in DA rats adds particular clinical features to the arthritis already induced by the oil. Notably, collagen autoimmunity which was induced after immunization with type II collagen in olive oil did not cause arthritis in DA rats, thus further emphasizing the role of adjuvant in inflammatory diseases induced after injection of specific autoantigens (Kleinau et al., to be published).",
