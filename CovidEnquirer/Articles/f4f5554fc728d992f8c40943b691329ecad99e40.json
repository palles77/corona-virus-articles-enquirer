Current commercially available ELISA kits detect group-specific antibodies; however, to understand the status of field infection, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) blocking ELISA (b-ELISA) against local IBVs was developed. The selected mAb showed specificity to Taiwan IBV strains but had no cross-reactivity with the vaccine strain H120. Using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test as a standard, the cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity of a b-ELISA using this mAb were evaluated in 390 field samples. The typespecificity of detection was validated using a panel of chicken hyperimmune sera. The results showed that the b-ELISA demonstrated high sensitivity (98.0%) and specificity (97.2%) of detection. The agreement between the results of the b-ELISA and the HI test was statistically significant (Kappa = 0.95), and there was no significant difference between these two methods (McNemar p = 0.72). The b-ELISA specifically detected Taiwan IBV serotypes but not three non-Taiwan IBV serotypes nor sera against other avian pathogens. This b-ELISA provides type-specific antibody detection of local IBV strains. It has the potential to serve as a rapid and reliable diagnostic method for IBV clinical infections in the field in Taiwan.",

Clinical syndromes include growth retardation in broilers, a drop in egg production in layers, and heavy mortality in poultry (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003) . In addition to hundreds of known serotypes, new viral variants have emerged due to rapid viral evolution and antigenic variation in avian coronaviruses (Cavanagh, 2005; Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003) .

Because it is a simple, rapid, sensitive, and large-scale tool, ELISA has been used widely in IBV serological profiling. The reaction antigen may be either whole virion or recombinant subunits. In previous works, recombinant spike (Wang et al., 2002) and nucleocapsid protein (Chen et al., 2003; Lugovskaya et al., 2006) expressed in bacteria or insect cells have been used as a coating antigen to improve the efficacy of detection.

Inoculation with Massachusetts (Mass)-type strains such as M41 and H120 has been implemented widely in Taiwan to control IBV for several decades. However, it has been a challenge to perform a sero-surveillance study of IBV in Taiwan due to the lack of serotype-specific diagnostic tools.

Furthermore, all of the samples used in this study for determining the cut-off value, sensitivity, and specificity of the b-ELISA were collected from local poultry farms. The ages of sampled chickens ranged from 3 to 25 wk and were distributed evenly in each group of detection.

Furthermore, the direct conjugation of the colour-developing enzyme HRP to the mAb used as a tracer reduces the incubation time by negating the need for a secondary antibody. If the plates are pre-coated and blocked, the whole reaction can be completed within two and a half hours. Given that variations in incubation time and temperature between individual runs of an ELISA affect the results (Perrotta et al., 1988) , the reaction condition of this b-ELISA was optimised to achieve a highest P/N ratio.",

The b-ELISA allows for the large-scale screening of field samples. The interpretation of the results is automated and objective. All of the essential reagents can be prepared in a large volume and stored in aliquots, allowing reaction conditions to be standardised from batch to batch. In addition, only 4 l of test sample is required for a single detection by b-ELISA, whereas a standard HI test requires 25 l of test sample to perform the serial dilution. The laborious preparation of chicken erythrocytes for the HI test can be also avoided by using b-ELISA. Unlike the end-point result produced by the HI test, the b-ELISA produces a continuous OD value and a more precise detection of antibody levels, and a recombinant subunit protein may be prepared as a substitute for the coating antigen to reduce the labour required for virus preparation.",

This could be explained by differences in the target antibodies detected by the two tests. Specifically, the HI test identifies the HI antibody, whereas the coating antigen (whole virion) of the b-ELISA reacts with a general population of antibodies. In addition, the mAb used in the b-ELISA is not reactive in HI tests, implying that the epitope directing interaction with mAb QI3-4 is distinct from those recognised by the HI antibody.",
