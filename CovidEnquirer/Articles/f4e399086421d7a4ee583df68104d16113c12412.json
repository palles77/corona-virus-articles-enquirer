Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain. The technique of in situ hybridization with film autoradiography should be generally useful for analyzing macroscopic movements of virus within infected organs. Q 1998 Academic press. hc.",

In preliminary experiments, we determined that this probe would readily anneal to intracellular RNA isolated from MHV-JHM-infected cells under stringent conditions of annealing. For the experiments described below, the insert from this clone was subcloned into a vector containing the SP6 promoter (pSP 18) and a clone with the insert in the antisense orientation was selected. Radioactive antisense RNA was synthesized using SP6 polymerase by standard procedures (Melton et al., 1984) 1 . Slot blot analysis of RNA from infected and uninfected samples. RNA was extracted from the brains and spinal cords of infected mice and from uninfected L-2 tissue culture cells. Blots were prepared, hybridized with 3'P-labeled antisense RNA probe, processed, and quantitated with a Shimadzu C-930 densitometer. The amounts of each RNA applied to the filter are shown at the left. (A) RNA from brain (lane 1) and spinal cord (lane 2) of mouse with acute encephalomyelitis (5 days p.i.), from brain (lane 3) and spinal cord (lane 4) of mouse with hindlimb paralysis (32 days p.i.), and from uninfected L-2 cells (lane 5). In this experiment, viral RNA was concentrated in the brain 50-fold compared to in the spinal cord in the acutely infected mouse, whereas the spinal cord of the mouse with hindlimb paralysis was 4.5-fold enriched in viral sequences as compared to the brain. (B) RNA from brain (lane 1) and spinal cord (lane 2) of mouse with acute encephalomyelitis (5 days p.i.) and from brain (lane 3) and spinal cord (lane 4) of maternal antibody-protected mouse (5 days p.i.). was also isolated from uninfected and infected L-2 tissue culture cells. All RNAs were shown to be intact by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis. For blot analysis, RNA was prepared and applied to nitrocellulose paper as previously described (Perlman et a/., 1986) . Prehybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 50 mM phosphate buffer, 5X SSC (1X SSC is 0.15 M NaCI, 0.0 15 M Na citrate), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1 mM EDTA, 250 pg/ml sonicated and denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 5X Denhardt's solution (50x Denhardt's solution is 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% Ficoll, and 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone) at 60\".

The distribution of viral RNA corresponded to the sites of maximal inflammatory response and necrosis. This result suggests that the brainstem is a site of initial infection and also an important site for persistence and, ultimately, amplification in the mice that develop hindlimb paralysis. In turn, this clinical sign is most likely the consequence of preferential viral replication The results suggest that MHV-JHM may spread within the CNS both to adjacent areas and to distant sites along well-defined neuronal pathways. In the acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA can be detected throughout the mesencephalon, the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the hippocampus, the hypothalamus, and the subcortical white matter. These structures are all in close proximity, and virus at high titer can be isolated from mice with this clinical disease. This suggests that viral spread is predominantly to contiguous areas with rapid and simultaneous destruction of many portions of the brain.",

In all cases, viral RNA was present in the ventral brainstem, at approximately the same location as in the mice analyzed a few days after inoculation. This result suggests that the brainstem not only is the site of primary viral replication, but also is the source for viral spread, including caudal progression to the spinal cord. In the first pattern, MHV-JHM RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second pattern, MHV-JHM was also present in the thalamus and cerebral grey matter, consistent with cell to cell transmission of virus from the brainstem to the thalamus and cerebrum via the corticospinal, corticopontine, spinothalamic, and corticothalamic tracts and the medial lemniscus. An alternative explanation is that viral replication may occur independently in each of these regions.",

Several white matter tracts (optic chiasm, fornix, corpus callosum, and white matter of the basal ganglia) in this latter part of the brain contained viral RNA whereas other areas of the CNS associated with each of these entities (e.g., the hippocampus and mammillary bodies with the fornix) did not. This suggests that virus reactivated in one of these white matter tracts, such as the optic chiasm, and spread to other white matter tracts in close physical proximity. Alternatively, virus could have reactivated in the brainstem, with transport to this region by connecting tracts such as the pallidotegmental fibers (connecting brainstem and basal ganglia). Previous studies have indicated that demyelinating lesions in the optic chiasm are prominent in MHV-JHM-infected rats with demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Nagashima et a/., 1978; Sorensen et a/., 1980). Regional localization by in situ hybridization and film autoradiography will be a useful technique for determining the location of virus in an infected brain as a function of time. Using this method with mice at different stages of development of clinical disease, it should be straightforward to determine the three-dimensional localization of virus at each time (Shepherd eta/., 1984) and from that, map the movement of virus during disease progression.",
