Increasingly, global alerts are based on 'unexpected' 'events' detected by surveillance systems grounded in particular places. An emerging global governance literature investigates the supposedly disruptive impact of public health emergencies on mobilities in an interdependent world. Little consideration has been given to the varied scales of governance -local, national and global -that operate at different stages in the unfolding of an 'event', together with the interactions and tensions between them. By tracking the chronology of the H1N1 pandemic, this paper highlights an emergent dialogue between local and global scales. It also draws attention to moments of national autonomy across the global North and South which undermined the WHO drive for transnational cooperation.",

One aspect of this cooperation has been the international community's increased use of, and reliance on, event-based information systems such as the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) and HealthMap. Whilst traditional indicator-based surveillance routinely report cases of disease, usually on a weekly or monthly basis, event-based surveillance aims to rapidly detect, report and assess public health events, including clusters of disease and rumours of unexplained deaths.",

These events may take the form of infectious disease outbreaks, terrorist attacks, civil unrest and weatherrelated emergencies (Anderson and Adey, 2012) . Crucially, they are located in specific places, detected by information systems, and communicated to other systems to form a network. As a consequence, these places assume a particular significance, as information about the event is broadcast to subscribers to these systems, including international institutions, such as the WHO.",

Yet, little consideration has been given to the operation of individual surveillance systems. Equally, within the domain of global governance, there has been a dearth of analysis into the ways in which the WHO and its member states use the 'informal' information supplied by these systems to make judgements about the spread and severity of global disease outbreaks. In this article, we place the activity of these systems within the context of the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic, considering how disease risk comes to be represented, and acted upon, across local, national and global scales of governance. Using Margaret Chan's call for 'new' international health diplomacy, we draw attention to the importance of places, often situated in countries of the global South, in providing the source material for specific global alerts, and we examine the subsequent responses by member states across the global North and South.",

This included information relating to volume of articles retrieved, classification of risk, issuing of alerts and further developments of the system. Finally empirical material on the H1N1 pandemic was obtained from Health Map, an open-access event-based system, dispatches from national regulatory bodies such as the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and news organisations, for example, BBC News Online. The data collection from this combination of sources facilitated analysis of the operation of global surveillance networks and the nature of global public health governance.",

            "text": "In recent years, 'biosecurity' -defined by Braun as 'political responses' to the 'unpredictability of molecular life ' (2007: 19 )has become a prominent site of enquiry as scholars have sought to understand various forms of expertise and practices through which disease threats are articulated and managed (King, 2004; Collier and Lakoff, 2008; Ingram, 2010) . Biosecurity operations are enacted within what Bingham et al. describe as a 'complex geography' where 'states and locales are increasingly asked to conform to what is regarded (in the metropolitan core) as a safe world ' (2008: 1529) . According to this perspective, it is the 'centralised expertise', often located in the countries of the global North, that press for 'globalising biosecurity practices' (Bingham et al., : 1529 , seeking 'maximal cooperation from all countries' (Ingram, 2009: 2) . In leading this drive for cooperation, transnational institutions, such as the WHO, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the World Bank have been perceived as enacting measures that, arguably, focus unduly on 'problems' in the global South (Brown and Bell, 2008; King, 2002) . This cooperative endeavour, within a supposedly imperial frame, is an outcome of a global approach to more broadly defined 'health security' that emerged in the late 1990s and which extended beyond infectious diseases to consider also threats to human health posed by bioweapons and radiation leaks (Ingram, 2009: 1) . At the turn of the twenty first century, the development of global surveillance networks began to change profoundly practices of health security at national and transnational scales. These networks electronically monitor online news sources and, in the case of 'syndromic surveillance', nondiagnostic information (Fearnley, 2008 (Fearnley, : 1615 1 . Following the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the widespread collation of such 'informal' information became a significant component of 'bioterrorist 'early-warning' systems' (Parry, 2009: 1; Fearnley, 2008) . During the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, this new form of technological surveillance also assumed a specific significance in detecting the onset of epidemics.",

It also highlighted the need for more advanced preparedness across national and global scales (Collier and Lakoff, 2008; Fearnley, 2008) . Rather than tackling specific dangers, preparedness is concerned with 'generic capacities that will enable responses to a broad spectrum of contingencies' (Ingram, 2010: 296; Fearnley, 2008) . At a national scale, preparedness planning has been guided by the framework documentation published by the WHO and adopted by its member states (WHO, 2009a) . For example, the UK's Pandemic Flu: a national framework, published in 2007, detailed various interventions including the stockpiling of drugs, and the imposition of restrictions on internal travel and public gatherings (Cabinet Office and Department of Health (DH), 2007). When one focuses on this national scale, it is apparent that, notwithstanding the drive for global cooperation led by the WHO, practices vary widely between countries, implying that internationally-imposed frameworks for health security may be 'more precarious and prone to breakdown than we usually give credit' (Bingham and Hinchliffe, 2008: 190) . The SARS outbreak demonstrated, nevertheless, that, through the influence of global surveillance networks and the information that they supplied, consistencies could be identified in the timing of the interventions by individual states. Building on Ingram (2010) , we argue that these networks have come to play an important mediating role in the spaces between preparedness and response.",

According to Keller et al. (2009) , almost all major disease epidemics investigated by the WHO over the last decade were first identified through these sources. The WHO claim these networks have proven to be particularly effective in detecting outbreaks among populations that 'do not access health care through formal channels' (2008a: 4). Consequently, biosecurity practices, notably alerts, have become ever more embedded in the work of global surveillance systems. Reports gathered by systems such as GPHIN, coupled with China's concealment of information during the early stages of the SARS outbreak, provided the impetus in 2005 for approval of the WHO's revised International Health Regulations (IHR). The IHR -which came into effect in June 2007 -gave the WHO a legal basis for greater intervention in the affairs of member states to enable, at least ostensibly, more effective global public health governance (WHO, 2008a) . Whereas the previous IHR only named a list of notifiable diseases, the revised Regulations formed another part of the global health security apparatus, with coverage extended to all 'public health emergencies of international concern' (WHO, 2008a). Although Article 6 imposed 'obligations' member states to 'notify' WHO of 'all events' that may constitute such an emergency (WHO, 2008a: 1), Article 9 of the IHR permitted the WHO to take account of information from sources other than official notifications and consultations, allowing it legally to override any national government that tried to suppress data concerning communicable disease. Within the context of international openness, 'informal' information on isolated disease outbreaks occurring in various places was granted a new authority.",

Collaboration among member states had broken down during 'recent events', not only due to China's concealment of SARS, but also as a result of Indonesia's withholding of H5N1 virus samples from the WHO in a dispute over proprietary rights to vaccines (Fidler, 2008) . In both instances, the consequences of a lack of cooperation had been harmful to global public health.

A subscription-based network, it was established in 1997 to provide 'relevant unverified information on disease outbreaks and other public health events' (Blench, 2008b) . In claiming to monitor on a global scale, it gathers data from local, national and transnational media sources in nine languages. Sources of information include websites, news wires and local and national newspapers (Keller et al., 2009: 690) . According to Blench, approximately 15% of retrieved articles are automatically 'published', 20% are trashed and the remaining 65% are put forward for human analysis (2008b). The degree of risk posed by an event is indicated by the assignation of an alert by a GPHIN analyst. (Keller et al., 2009: 691) . report that alerts are deemed necessary for events that 'might have serious public health consequences' and they are sent 'immediately' to GPHIN users. Our correspondence with GPHIN officials 2 confirmed that all alerts are published after analysis and that, if articles are published automatically, an analyst has an opportunity to review them post-publication and assign an alert. It is this human analysis process, demonstrating the importance of interpretation and judgement in the grading of risk, which distinguishes GPHIN from other surveillance systems such as Health Map and EpiSPI-DER (Keller et al., 2009: 693) .

Cooperation with the WHO was deemed, therefore, to be highly desirable. Thus, effective global public health governance, led by the WHO, requires high quality, yet 'informal', event-based information from surveillance networks, together with communications from member states, via both statutory mechanisms such as the NFPs and through less formal personal contacts.

From its initial reporting in parts of Mexico at the beginning of April 2009, the outbreak caused the WHO steadily to raise the level of alert from Phase 3 to Phase 6 (on 1 June 2009). Pandemic 'phases'used to 'provide a framework to aid countries in pandemic preparedness and response planning' (WHO, 2009a) -have been a feature of WHO influenza guidance. Although subject to some change, the phase structure has consistently included a description of key characteristics -the existence of which, we contend, is often based on 'informal' information provided by surveillance networks -and a list of measures to be taken by the WHO. Actions are also recommended, though not prescribed, for national authorities (WHO, 2009a) .",

Our interview with a senior UK health official strongly endorsed this notion of discretion 4 . Indeed, the official believed that certain jurisdictions were too ready to 'borrow' WHO phases and await its instructions, rather than developing pandemic preparedness plans that reflected their own strategic needs 5 . Analysis of the timing and sequence of alerts in relation to the H1N1 pandemic influenza demonstrated that one outcome of this display of individual discretion was heated debate between the WHO and some of its member states. Examination of the chronology of the pandemic and the spatialities involved illustrate that, whilst the networks of surveillance were profoundly important in shaping the WHO's alerting process, a complex set of interactions existed within member states in which a sense of globally shared responsibility competed with national interests. In particular, there were key moments when the WHO pandemic alerting, and advice on cooperation, were constrained by member state practices of preparedness. In this section, we highlight three such moments.",

GPHIN was seen, therefore, to act as mediator, transmitting information from localities in Mexico to the WHO. Following further verification from Mexico, the WHO was able to respond with its first disease outbreak notice on 24 April 2009. A day later, the Director-General formally declared the event a 'public health emergency of international concern' (WHO, 2009b).

China, for example, required incoming passengers to report flu-like symptoms at ports of entry when arriving from H1N1-affected areas (BBC News, 2009 ). Singapore was one of many countries that deployed thermal scanners to screen air passengers on arrival, whilst Japan increased the use of pre-existing scanners at Narita International Airport (Reuters, 2009a) . Moreover, and in direct contravention of WHO advice, measures were introduced aimed at restricting travel. On 28 April, Cuba became the first country to suspend flights to Mexico, an action that had been adopted by a number of tour operators across Europe, including Thomson and Thomas Cook (Bone et al., 2009 ). Other member states -such as the UK, Australia, France and Switzerland -advised against 'non-essential' travel to Mexico (Bone et al., 2009 ). These actions proved contentious. The UK's travel advisory -issued against Mexico on 27 April 2009 by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office -resulted in strong debate within government as to its efficacy 6 . Moreover, some academics asserted that Mexico -stigmatised by negative media coverage and by references in certain quarters to the outbreak as 'Mexican Flu' (Gostin, 2009 (Gostin, : 2377 -was being 'singled out [y] for all the wrong reasons' (Condon and Sinha, 2009: 21) .",

The retrieved articles were geo-coded, although, according to GPHIN, this was not always accurate due to errors on the part of the news publishers 8 . Nevertheless, this attempt to ground the initial reporting of the event in particular places was significant. It gave specificity to the H1N1 outbreak and facilitated the tracking of its geographical spread-from Mexico and the US, to Canada and then Spain (WHO, 2011) . Whilst this locational reporting could be used by certain countries to discriminate against selected others, arguably it also influenced the subsequent actions of the WHO which sought to harmonise and integrate national approaches to biosecurity . Indeed, the WHO signalled the importance it attached to global cooperation when it combined with the FAO, the OIE and the World Trade Organization to issue a joint statement on the H1N1 virus, declaring that the consumption of pork posed no sanitary risks (World Trade Organization (WTO), 2009).",

Additionally, social distancing measures were sporadically introduced in a number of states. For example, schools were closed in parts of the US and in the UK (Gostin, 2009) The efficacy of these national actions has been questioned. For instance, whilst China claimed that its virus-containment efforts appeared to have been 'an amazing success' (Yanzhong, 2010) , WHO recommendations advised against entry and exit screenings as it did not believe they would help reduce the spread of the disease (WHO, 2009d). Cowling et al. (2010) reported that the implementation of entry screening policies coincided with an average 7-12 day' delay in local transmissions of H1N1 in comparison with countries that did not implement entry screening. Yet it was also noted that, in countries where entry screening policies were in place, 'the majority of cases were identified through the local health care system after arrival' (Cowling et al., 2010: 7) . School closures also proved controversial. In the US, the CDC quickly reversed its position on imposing this sanction (Gostin, 2009) , whilst in the UK the timing of such shutdowns generated local hostility .",

On declaring the onset of pandemic Phase 6, Margaret Chan gave general guidance to member states, requesting that those with little or no cases 'remain vigilant', whilst countries experiencing widespread transmission focus on 'appropriate management of patients' (WHO, 2009e) . The WHO also advised countries to continue to implement their preparedness plans (WHO, 2009f) . Ironically, it became clear that some national plans contained measures which conflicted with WHO guidance. The inconsistency in the advice received and the practices that followed was stark.",

Therefore, the financial and diplomatic costs (in terms of strained relations with Mexico, Canada and, potentially, the WHO) were, for Chinese government leaders, 'secondary' to the projection to their population of an image of 'a caring government fully in charge' (Yanzhong, 2010) .

The outbreak of H1N1, the first pandemic outbreak for over 40 years, provided an early test of the operation of event-based surveillance systems which had been transformed following the 2003 SARS epidemic. It also opened to scrutiny the WHO's new disease reporting and verification framework, established under the IHR (2005). In the context of a contemporary global focus on anticipation and preparedness, examined earlier in this paper, our discussion centres on: (i) the spatialities of public health surveillance, and the efficacy of the subsequent global response to the H1N1 outbreak; (ii) the diversity of member state pandemic planning and biosecurity practices. We argue that, whilst surveillance systems opened up a space for interaction between local and global scales, the complexities engendered by manifold national pandemic preparedness and response measures 'intervened' in some instances to 'disrupt' the smooth implementation of global public health governance.",

In enabling the rapid retrieval of 'informal' information across a range of localities, data collected through these mechanisms has been used by the WHO and its member states to anticipate threats which, to use Ingram's phrase, 'do not yet exist ' (2010: 296) . In the process, the surveillance systems act as intermediaries, facilitating a localglobal dialogue. The technologies are largely deployed and developed by organisations in the global North, yet their success is dependent on the reporting of events in places across the global North and South. Moreover, decisions made by these systems to issue alerts are, in the main, dependant on uncovering largely 'informal' information broadcast through local press reports, news wires and online sources such as discussion sites (Grein et al., 2000) . In the case of H1N1, our research has demonstrated that, through a process of 'verification', this information became 'formalised' and established a basis for issuing global alerts. Thus, implicit in this local-global interaction, was detailed analysis derived from information in the public domain, on what was said rather than what was left unsaid. Undoubtedly, there will be selectivity in the reporting process and a partiality in the information derived.",

It involved anticipation of -and preparedness for -an event (an influenza pandemic) that had not yet been detected in some countries. Moreover, for the WHO, the imperative to establish a bridge between preparedness, and response, arguably shaped its interpretation of the information it received from event-based systems. Significantly, during the onset of the H1N1 pandemic, there followed widespread debate in academic and policy circles over what should be a proportionate response (Brown, 2009) . Subsequent to its declaration of an influenza pandemic in June 2009, the WHO was criticised for the 'delay' in its response (Brown, 2009) . Conversely, when the outbreak proved to be less severe than initially feared, it was accused of 'overstating' the dangers posed by the pandemic. Indeed, a draft report commissioned by the Council of Europe accused the WHO of 'lacking transparency' (Bosely, 2010) . In particular, questions were raised in that document, and elsewhere, about conflicts of interest among members of WHO advisory groups and expert committees, with many individual members understood to have received funding from pharmaceutical companies that manufactured antivirals and influenza vaccines (Bosley, 2010; WHO, 2010d) . Although the WHO-commissioned Review 9 found no evidence of malfeasance, the controversy was a reminder of the complexities involved in engaging stakeholders from technology companies, vaccine manufacturers and national governments in affecting global response to a pandemic (WHO, 2011).",

These measures proved in the main to be of limited use. Although China credited its 'stringent' quarantine practices with postponing community-level transmission of the virus, their duration was criticised (Metzl, 2009 ). Moreover, little evidence supported the use of thermal image screening to calculate passenger temperature as a means of identifying travellers suffering from fever (Nuzzo, 2009 ). In addition, in order to 'secure' their borders, a number of countries explicitly acted against global guidance. For example, legally contentious pork embargos were imposed -initially against Mexico and parts of the US and Canada -by 20 countries including Russia, China, Philippines and Indonesia (Gostin, 2009) .

If global health security is indeed a projection of the 'neocolonial' global North interests as Mykhalovskiy (2006, 2010) argue, then it is being undermined by selected member states in the global South. Equally, global governance is being challenged by a range of countries across both hemispheres. Thus, whilst Braun argues 'biological existence' in the global South is ever more subject to biosecurity projects that 'seek to pre-empt risk through new forms of sovereign power', we contend that there is scope for autonomy, and independent biosecurity practices by individual countries, within what some critics may perceive as a new manifestation of 'empire ' (2007: 25) . Granted, the consequences of this autonomy have not been overlooked. Indeed, the WHO Review suggested that the 'impact' of the unilateral border measures adopted by member states be assessed, with a view to producing tighter 'guidance for future events' (WHO, 2011: 14) .",

As a consequence of this technological openness, particular locations occupy important positions in the reporting process, and WHO member states are no longer able to withhold information on an 'event' that is in the public domain. National autonomy is reasserted, nevertheless, through the control actions deployed.

Rather than global health security representing a projection of global North interests, space remained for the exercise of national sovereignty and control. In this supposedly new era of international health diplomacy, the drive for global health governance has prompted a complex range of technological interactions, diplomatic engagements and biosecurity practices across local, national and global scales.",
