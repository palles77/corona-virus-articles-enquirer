New arrivals may benefit from recommended or indicated screening for medical conditions that have implications in terms of personal and community health. Additionally, foreign nationals seeking residence through organized immigration and refugee programs are required to undergo screening according to legislative, regulatory, or administrative directive. Similar epidemiologic principles govern the science and the application of both screening processes. However, the rationale underlying these two screening approaches differs in terms of historical basis, operational characteristics, and ultimate goals. Mandatory medical screening for immigration purposes is used for regulatory reasons, such as the determination of inadmissibility on medical grounds for immigration applicants. It often takes place or begins abroad as a component of the formal immigration process. Screening for medical conditions of personal health significance is intended to improve health parameters or outcomes for the migrant following arrival or re-settlement.",

In the USA, this process began in the late 1800s when the control of immigration was legally recognized as a congressional responsibility. Subsequently, the US Immigration Act of 1882 made specific reference to controlling the admission of immigrants on medical grounds.

'Medical grounds of inadmissibility' can occur when an applicant has a health condition which is a public health concern to the USA.

Each of these categories of medical inadmissibility grounds is further classified into Class A or Class B conditions by the examining panel physicians performing the immigration medical assessment. Class A is any condition that poses a significant risk to public health, public order, or personal life, and renders the applicant inadmissible on medical grounds, unless a waiver is obtained. Class B conditions are defined as a past health history or current physical examination that may require medical follow-up for the well-being of the individual.

Table 18 .2 presents some of the clinical screening issues for healthcare providers working with defined migrant populations. With globalization of economies and trade, rapidity of inter-regional transportation, and increasing international population mobility for temporary and permanent relocation, healthcare professionals will be challenged to recognize both imported clinical syndromes and to be sensitive to quiescent conditions of both personal and public health significance when dealing with migrants. Mobile populations crossing boundaries of disease prevalence and with wide diversity represented in health determinant factors, will heighten disparities in disease risk in non-endemic or low-prevalence regions.",

Increasingly in high-health service regions with low prevalence of any poor health indicators, and excellent local public health programs, migrants and other mobile populations are becoming the 'at-risk' populations. Many of the factors impacting on adverse health outcomes in migrants are amenable to screening, and have effective interventions for health promotion or disease prevention.",
