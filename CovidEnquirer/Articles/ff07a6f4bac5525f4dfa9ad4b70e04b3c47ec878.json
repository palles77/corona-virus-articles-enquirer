Lymphopenia and elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were the most common initial laboratory findings. Initial chest radiographs revealed various pattern abnormalities and normal results. Five of the 14 patients required mechanical ventilation. The need for mechanical ventilation was associated with bilateral lung involvement on the initial chest radiograph and higher peak levels of LDH and CRP. Clinical severity of disease varied from mild to severe. At 8 months after disease onset, patients with mild or moderate SARS had normal findings or only focal fibrosis on chest high-resolution computed tomography. However, bilateral fibrotic changes remained in the 4 patients who had recovered from severe SARS, 1 of whom had mild restrictive ventilatory impairment. One patient with severe SARS died; she was elderly and had other comorbidities. Five additional patients had reduced diffusing capacity.",

In those receiving mechanical ventilation, pulmonary function was only mildly reduced at 6 to 8 months after acute illness, consistent with the natural history of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to other causes. Although several case series of SARS have been reported, 7-9 to our knowledge, a prospective clinical study including long-term follow-up assessment by chest radiography, chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and pulmonary function testing has not been reported, particularly for hospital-acquired cases. This prompted us to study prospectively the presenting manifestations and the eventual clinical outcome of 14 patients with hospital-acquired SARS.",

Although the initial chest x-ray films were normal in 3 patients, radiographic abnormalities were noted on films obtained 1 to 2 days later. All 14 of these patients with SARS were admitted to the isolation wards at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. We classified the severity of SARS into 3 groups on the basis of the oxygenation status of the patients at enrollment: mild was defined by a normal PaO 2 , moderate was defined by an abnormally low PaO 2 but a PaO 2 /fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) ratio of 200 mm Hg or higher, and severe was defined by a PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio lower than 200 mm Hg.

The PCR products were observed through 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis ( Figure 1 ).

In cases of acute lung injury (PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio <200 mm Hg), methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg per day was administered intravenously, and the dosage was tapered subsequently according to clinical response. The criteria for tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation included an absolute indication, PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio less than 100 mm Hg, and a relative indication, PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio of 100 to 200 mm Hg. Mechanical ventilation was used with a low tidal volume (6-8 mL/kg), plateau pressure lower than 30 to 35 cm H 2 O, and adequate positive endexpiratory pressure to lessen the likelihood of barotrauma. 11",

Only 1 patient had mildly restrictive pulmonary impairment, and 5 other patients had a decreased diffusing capacity. All our patients who survived ARDS had abnormal diffusing capacity that was reduced compared with that in our SARS patients who did not have ARDS. Orme et al 21 found that approximately 80% of their ARDS survivors who did not have SARS had reduced diffusing capacity. Our study found no evidence of pronounced airway obstruction in SARS survivors, an outcome similar to that reported by Aggarwal et al 22 and Schelling et al. 23 In the latter study, surviving SARS patients not experiencing ARDS had no long-term airflow limitations. In contrast, Orme et al 21 reported that 20% of their ARDS survivors who did not have SARS had longterm airflow obstruction. Although the discrepancy of airway obstruction is unclear, it might be due to patient selection bias because some ARDS survivors had a history of chronic airway disease. In our study, 1 SARS-ARDS survivor (25%) had long-term mildly restrictive pulmonary impairment with reduced TLC. The main reason for impaired pulmonary function might be the same as for all ARDS survivors, regardless of whether they experienced SARS. The reduced TLC and reduced FVC were due to lung fibrosis and neuromuscular weakness, respectively. 22 Our findings in SARS-ARDS survivors showed only mild reductions in pulmonary function 6 to 8 months after the acute severe illness, consistent with the natural history of ARDS survivors in other studies. 21, 22 SARS is highly infectious among close contacts. Although the predominant pathology of SARS involves the lungs, other organs can be involved with the SARS coronavirus. 24 An accurate and rapid diagnostic test will be of great importance for managing this disease in the future. Until such a diagnostic test is available, a clear picture of the clinical presentation of SARS should help physicians recognize this condition. Early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate supportive therapy are the keys to reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with this potentially deadly infection.",

By this time, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had named the condition severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and had provided a clinical case definition. 3 During an outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Hong Kong, scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in Hong Kong announced that a new coronavirus had been isolated from patients with SARS. 4 Additional cases of suspected SARS were reported worldwide, 5 but China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto (Canada), and Taiwan have borne the brunt of the caseload. The first case of SARS occurred in Taiwan in February 2003 6 : a merchant was returning to Taipei from the Guangdong Province via Hong Kong. On March 14 and 17, 2003, his wife and son, respectively, presented with probable SARS. Soon thereafter, other Taiwanese citizens returning from mainland China and Hong Kong were diagnosed as having SARS. During the early stages of the additional outbreaks in Taiwan, awareness of this new communicable disease was poor, and stringent infection control procedures had not been implemented in the hospitals, leading to a series of hospital-acquired infections.",
