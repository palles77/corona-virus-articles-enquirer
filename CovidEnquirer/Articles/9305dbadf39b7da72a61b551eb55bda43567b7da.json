A sputum culture yielded normal oral flora, and sputum smears were negative for acid-fast bacilli. Nasopharyngeal aspiration was negative for influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2, and 3, with the use of commercial immunofluorescence assay. A chest radiograph on day 4 showed progression of pneumonia, with consolidation changes over the right upper and lower lobes (Figure, part B) . A repeat complete blood profile showed a leukocyte count of 5.4 x 10 9 /L with persistent lymphopenia and a platelet count of 98 x 10 9 /L. Amoxicillin-clavulanate was therefore changed to intravenous cefotaxime, 1 g every 8 h; clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day) was continued. As the patient's condition deteriorated progressively and he had difficulty in expectorating sputum, salbutamol, 0.5 g four times a day, driven by a jet nebulizer at 6 L of oxygen per min, was given to assist mucociliary clearance. His oxygen saturation remained normal without supplemental oxygen.",

The use of a nebulized bronchodilator may also have enhanced the spread of the virus in the ward, and this practice was stopped for patients with suspected SARS after this incident (7). This case report illustrates the natural history of SARS in a young, previously healthy patient who received no specific therapy. His clinical features and laboratory parameters were similar to those of other patients with SARS (2) (3) (4) (5) . His clinical course followed a typical pattern with progression of pneumonia during the 2nd week of his illness (8) .
