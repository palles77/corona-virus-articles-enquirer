            "text": "Collectins are a family of collagenous Ca 2+ -dependent (C-type) lectins that are highly conserved in evolution and also function as soluble PRMs. C-type lectins contain a collagen-like region linked to a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), known as the carbohydrate-binding C-type lectin domain (CTLD), which enables binding to oligosaccharide (or lipid) structures expressed on the surface of an array of microorganisms [11] . Members of this family include the wellcharacterized 'classical collectins' mannose-binding lectin (MBL), surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D. Serum MBL is produced by the liver and is constitutively expressed in the blood at a concentration of $200 ng/ml during normal circumstances, which can be elevated to as high as $800 ng/ml during virus infections [12, 13] . MBL plays a crucial role in the activation of the lectin complement pathway via interactions with MBL-associated serine protease (MASP). In contrast, SP-A and SP-D are predominantly found within the airways where they play a number of roles in modulating inflammation and phospholipid homeostasis [14] . Recently, a growing number of 'novel collectins' have been identified, which include collectin (CL) liver 1 (CL-L1) [15] , CL kidney 1 (CL-K1) [16] , and CL placenta 1 (CL-P1) [17] , as well as the bovine-specific collectins conglutinin [18] , CL-43 [19] , and CL-46 [20] . As discussed below, recognition by collectins can lead to elimination of microorganisms by a range of mechanisms, including aggregation, opsonization, activation of phagocytosis, inhibition of microbial growth, or complement activation. In addition to microbial recognition, collectins have also been implicated in modulating is composed of immune cells, such as leukocytes and phagocytes, as well as immune mediators secreted by these cells. The humoral arm is composed of the complement cascade and pattern-recognition molecules (PRMs). Crosstalk between the two arms of innate immunity is crucial to respond promptly to stimuli and facilitate adaptive immune response.",

The basal expression of PTX3 detected in the blood of healthy individual is approximately 2 ng/ml, which rapidly increase to a range of 200 to 800 ng/ml upon stimulation by proinflammatory cytokines during pathogen invasion [3, 24] . The protective role of PTX3 during microbial infection has been long established; however, more recent studies suggest that PTX3 might also contribute to immunopathology during certain infections.",

            "text": "Fungi PTX3 binds to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia, and PTX3-deficient mice show increased susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis associated with an inappropriate immune response skewed towards a Th2 response [25] . Treatment with recombinant PTX3 had therapeutic activity either alone or when combined with antifungal agents [4, 22, [25] [26] [27] [28] . PTX3 is stored in neutrophil granules and is rapidly released upon cell stimulation [29] . In addition, the molecule was found in neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and PTX3 can opsonize A. fumigatus conidia inside these structures [29] . PTX3-deficient neutrophils were less effective in recognizing and eliminating A. fumigatus conidia, and opsonization of spores by PTX3 could reverse this phenotype [25, 29, 30] . Interestingly, neutrophil-associated-PTX3 promoted the in vivo control of A. fumigatus infection [29] . Molecular mechanisms involved in this activity have been recently highlighted [30] . Briefly, the binding of PTX3-opsonized conidia to FcgRII, which has been shown to be a receptor for pentraxins [31] , induces an inside-out activation of CD11b and a subsequent phagocytosis of C3b-opsonized conidia [30] . In addition, PTX3 can interact with ficolin-2 and MBL on the pathogen surface, and the formation of the heterocomplexes PTX3/ficolin-2 and PTX3/MBL can promote the deposition of complement, as observed on the surface of A. fumigatus and Candida albicans, respectively [32, 33] .",

Interestingly, PTX3 polymorphisms were recently associated with susceptibility to A. fumigatus infection in two cohorts of patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation [37] .

PTX3-deficient animals showed increased susceptibility to cytomegalovirus (CMV) and specific strains of influenza virus [46, 47] . Mechanistically, PTX3 had the capacity to bind to human and murine CMV (MCMV), inhibiting the entry of virus into DCs and inducing interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation [46] . Administration of PTX3 in BALB/c mice, known for their susceptibility to CMV infection, had therapeutic efficacy against primary infection and reactivation and protected MCMV-infected mice from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [46] . PTX3 recognized also specific strains of H3N2 subtype influenza A viruses (IAV, H3N2) via an interaction between the glycosidic moiety of PTX3 and the haemagglutinin glycoprotein found on the surface of viruses [47] . In turn, this interaction led to a number of antiviral activities, including inhibition of viral haemagglutination and neuraminidase activities, as well as neutralization of virus infectivity [47] . As a consequence, PTX3-deficient animals had increased susceptibility to H3N2 infection, and administration of PTX3 had therapeutic activity [47] . In contrast, PTX3 did not display any protective effect during infection with both seasonal and pandemic H1N1 IAV and other H3N2 strains, likely due to a loss of interaction between the viral haemagglutinin and PTX3 [48, 49] .",

Despite the bulk evidence demonstrating a protective role for PTX3 during microbial invasion, recent studies using murine models of inflammatory diseases have suggested its potential to promote immunopathology. The first evidence suggestive of PTX3 pathogenicity was reported in 2006, using a lethal animal model of K. pneumoniae infection [51] . Infection of PTX3 transgenic mice overexpressing PTX3 with a high inoculum of K. pneumoniae resulted in accelerated lethality and this correlated with reduced infiltration of neutrophils into the lung tissues and enhanced bacterial dissemination in blood during acute infection. Ironically, when infection was performed using low pulmonary inocula, the overt expression of PTX3 conferred a protective effect, enabling robust expression of proinflammatory cytokines, an influx of neutrophils to lungs, and enhanced phagocytosis of bacteria [51] . This study clearly demonstrated the double-edged sword characteristics of PTX3 in shaping disease outcome during an infection.",

The study conducted by Foo et al. characterized overt expression of PTX3 during the acute phase of alphavirus infection in patients and animal models. Further characterization of the alphavirus mouse models identified neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes as the cellular reservoirs of rapid PTX3 production during the acute phase of infection. The presence of PTX3 promoted early viral entry and replication events through binding interactions with alphavirus, modulating the kinetic profiles of proinflammatory cytokines, and cellular infiltration in response to alphavirus infection, which consequentially shaped the progression of alphaviral disease ( Figure 2 ). This study characterized PTX3 as a pivotal immunomodulatory protein associated with the pathogenic characteristics of alphavirus infection. Additionally, this study also demonstrated how the supposedly beneficial PTX3 could be hijacked and exploited by viruses to promote viral replication in the host [12] .",

In a context of sterile inflammation, such as in tissue injury mediated by ischaemia and reperfusion, PTX3 can be protective (e.g., kidney) or deleterious (e.g., intestine), depending on the tissue [52, 53] . PTX3 is endowed with a strong immunomodulatory role which can have a diverse impact on downstream innate immune responses, strongly suggestive of its therapeutic potential. However, taking into account the pathogenicity of PTX3 exhibited during alphavirus infections, study cohorts from future clinical trials involving PTX3 administration should be carefully assessed to avoid the inclusion of alphavirusinfected individuals as test subjects, which may result in deleterious clinical effects. To date, our understanding of PTX3 represents only the tip of an iceberg. More functional studies are warranted to further characterize the mechanism(s) underlying the immunomodulatory role of PTX3, which will enhance its utility in the development of novel therapeutics using recombinant or modified PTX3, as well as agonists and antagonists to modulate its secretion.",

Of interest, MBL-mediated recognition resulted in enhanced infection of human cells by Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, and West Nile viruses by macropinocytosis in low-complement conditions [69] . MBL-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection of the brain occurs via alternative mechanisms, whereby gp120 shed by HIV-1 can be internalized via CXCR4 on neuronal cells, then bound and trafficked by intracellular MBL where it has been proposed to induce gp120-mediated neuronal apoptosis [70, 71] .",

Moreover, both SP-A and SP-D have been detected at extrapulmonary sites, including the gastrointestinal tract and kidney [82] . In addition to their role in innate host defence, SP-A and SP-D play a number of important physiological roles related to airway homeostasis [83] . In vitro studies indicate that SP-A and SP-D bind to a range of Grampositive and Gram-negative bacteria and contribute to bacterial clearance by a number of mechanisms, including opsonization to increase phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages [84, 85] and neutrophils [63] as well as direct antimicrobial effects against Gram-negative bacteria [86, 87] . Mice deficient in SP-A or SP-D, or with combined deficiency in both, have been used to demonstrate important protective roles for both pulmonary collectins against a range of different bacteria [88] and to show that the functions of SP-A and SP-D are not completely redundant during bacterial infections [89] .",

While the ability of SP-A and SP-D to promote phagocytosis of extracellular bacteria by macrophages contributes to effective host defence, one could speculate that uptake of intracellular pathogens into their intracellular niche has the potential to exacerbate disease severity. Both SP-A and SP-D bind and agglutinate Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and SP-A enhances phagocytosis via upregulation of functional mannose receptor at the cell surface [93] , whereas SP-D inhibits phagocytosis by macrophages [94] . However, SP-A \u00c0/\u00c0 , SP-D \u00c0/\u00c0 , or SP-A/D \u00c0/\u00c0 mice displayed no major defects in uptake or control of M. tuberculosis in a low-dose, aerosol challenge model of tuberculosis, indicating that either or both pulmonary collectins are dispensable in the mouse model [95] . Both SP-A and SP-D also bind to Legionella pneumophila and suppress, rather than promote, intracellular growth in macrophages [96] . Of interest, HIV replication does occur in the lung, particularly during advanced disease [97] , and SP-A has been reported to promote transfer of HIV-1 from dendritic cells to T cells [98] .",

Ficolins bind to acetylated compounds, including acetylated sugars found on the surface of some microbes [99] . Protective roles of MBL and ficolins have been reported during several microbial infections (Figure 3 ). In humans, there are three different forms of ficolin (H-, L-, and M-ficolin), which resemble MBL in overall structure, Ca 2+ -dependent binding to pathogens, and ability to activate complement independently of antibody (reviewed in [100] ). In general terms, it is well established that ficolins bind a range of Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and P. aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., S. aureus and Aerococcus viridans) where they can serve as opsonins to increase phagocytosis and/or activate the lectin pathway of complement (reviewed in [101] ). Recently, L-ficolin was shown to promote conidial uptake and killing of A. fumigatus by macrophages and neutrophils [102] . In the context of viral infections, L-and H-ficolins bind to IAV glycoproteins to inhibit virus infection in vitro and in vivo [103] [104] [105] . Binding of L-ficolin to viral N-glycans expressed by hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV was reported to trigger activation of the lectin pathway complement [101, 106] , and L-ficolin can neutralize HCV infectivity [107, 108] .",

The complex formation subsequently promoted phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and suppressed the production of IL-8 in human monocyte-derived macrophages, preventing excessive inflammatory responses and neutrophil recruitment [111] . These studies demonstrated the importance of crosstalk between ficolins and PTX3 in amplifying the innate immune responses through activation of the lectin complement pathway. What Is the Effect(s) of MBL-PTX3 Complex Formation during Microbial Infections? A recent structural study using MBL demonstrated binding to, and formation of, heterocomplexes with PTX3, giving rise to the cross-activation of complement pathways [33] .

However, emerging evidence regarding the pathogenicity of MBL and PTX3 suggests a potentially pathogenic role for MBL-PTX3 heterocomplexes during alphavirus infections. Recent studies identified the N-terminus as a functional domain of PTX3 which modulates pathogenicity during alphavirus infection [12] . In a separate study, MBL was shown to induce deposition of complement component C3 on inflamed tissues, resulting in alphavirus-induced arthritis during acute RRV infection [13] . Therefore, based on the functional roles identified for PTX3, MBL, and MBL-PTX3 heterocomplexes, one can speculate that PTX3 and MBL are likely to complex during alphavirus infection and act in synergy to modulate viral replication and innate immunity. The presence of MBL-PTX3 complexes may trigger excessive activation of the lectin pathway, which, in turn, could give rise to extensive tissue destruction and exacerbated disease outcome during alphavirus infections (Figure 4 ). Future investigations are essential to dissect the immunological roles of MBL-PTX3 complexes, and these humoral innate immune complexes may be effective therapeutic targets in the defence against alphavirus infection (see Outstanding Questions).",

The multifunctional roles of humoral pentraxins and collectins add to the complexity of eliciting appropriate innate immune responses. Despite intensive research efforts, our understanding of how the innate immune system detects and responds to different pathogens to shape, limit, or exacerbate disease severity is still limited. This review has discussed two families of humoral innate immune proteins which can mediate potential antimicrobial and immunoregulatory activities but, if dysregulated or activated inappropriately, can also act as potent inducers of immunopathology. Currently, further studies are required to clarify the functional and physiological roles of heterocomplexes formed between pentraxins and collectins or ficolins. Heterocomplex formation is dependent on sialylated moeities which are expressed on the N-terminal domain of PTX3 and CRD of collectins. Hence, computational and structural studies investigating those particular glycosylation sites (as well as the nature of the glycans expressed) on pentraxins and collectins will provide new insights into our current understanding regarding heterocomplex formation. Identification of key glycosylation sites that affect the functional role of these proteins may serve as the first step towards the development of new therapeutic strategies for intervention with a broad spectrum of microbial infections in the near future.

In the context of viral infections, MBL can bind to viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and influenza A virus (IAV), while ficolin binds to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), resulting in virus neutralization and inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis. During bacterial infections, MBL binds to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, while ficolins bind both of these bacteria as well as Salmonella enterica and Aerococcus viridans, forming immunocomplexes and gaining entry into host cells through phagocytosis.",

During an alphavirus infection, immune cells such as inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils are rapidly recruited to the site of infection. These activated immune cells express high levels of proinflammatory cytokines during alphavirus infection which promote tissue damage, as well as overt expression of humoral MBL and PTX3. MBL can, in turn, bind to alphavirus to form the MBL-alphavirus heterocomplexes, or it can bind to PTX3 to form MBL-PTX3-alphavirus heterocomplexes. These heterocomplexes can then activate the complement cascade, resulting in arthritis and myositis.",

            "text": "Figure 2. Proposed Model for Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) as an Immunoregulatory Protein during Acute Alphavirus Infection. Following an infectious bite, Ross River virus (RRV) infects fibroblasts to trigger the expression of PTX3 which, in turn, binds to RRV. The presence of RRV triggers recruitment of immune cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, to the site of infection. Activated neutrophils express PTX3 which binds to P-selectin, dampening recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes. Recruited monocytes differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which phagocytose RRV and migrate back to the blood. RRV replication occurs in infected DCs and macrophages, releasing new virions that can complex with PTX3 to form PTX3-RRV complexes. The PTX3-RRV complex is recognized by a putative PTX3 receptor, enhancing viral entry through receptor-mediated endocytosis, and subsequently enhancing viral replication. Large amounts of RRV RNA released in the cytoplasm can be detected by pathogen receptors, triggering the activation of the NF-kB pathway and inducing proinflammatory immune responses. In the absence of PTX3, RRV infection triggers abundant recruitment of immune cells due to unbound P-selectin. RRV particles gain entry into the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, leading to reduced viral entry and replication. The presence of fewer virions gives rise to delayed inflammatory responses. Abbreviations: IFN-g, interferon-gamma; ss-RNA, single-stranded RNA.",
