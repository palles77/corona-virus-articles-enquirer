            "text": "Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to be reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Data on the phenomenon of intermittent positive results for MERS-CoV on reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with negative results in between are lacking. Here we describe cases with intermittent positive MERS-CoV test results and highlight the required number of tests to rule out or rule in MERS-CoV infection based on a large retrospective cohort of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV. Methods: This analysis included cases admitted between January 2014 and December 2017. The included patients had a minimum of 3 nasopharyngeal MERS-CoV RT-PCR tests for confirmation and needed 2 negative samples for MERS-CoV evaluated 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization apart to ensure clearance. Results: A total of 408 patients with positive MERS-CoV test results were treated at the referring hospital. We excluded 72 patients who had only 1 swab result available in the system and were treated in the initial years of the disease. Of the remaining 336 patients, 300 (89%) had a positive result after 1 swab, 324 (96.5%) had a positive result after 2 consecutive swabs, and 328 (97.6%) had a positive result after 3 consecutive swabs. Of the total cases, 46 (13.7%) had a positive MERS-CoV test then a negative test, followed by positive test results. Conclusions: Our data indicate that 2 to 3 nasopharyngeal samples are needed to produce the highest yield of positive results for MERS-CoV. In addition, 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients from MERS-CoV. Evaluation of the yield of sputum samples is needed to assess the effectiveness against nasopharyngeal swabs.",

A confirmed case was defined as a patient testing positive for the 2 genes.

Despite the great value of molecular testing, several concerns were raised early in its application. The poor reliability of upper respiratory tract samples (ie, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) necessitates deep sampling from the lower respiratory tract (sputum and tracheal aspirates). 6, 8 Lower respiratory tract specimens, such as tracheal aspirates and sputum, have been found to be more reliable for detecting MERS-CoV including viral loads, and throat swabs are considered a useful alternative. 10 Repeat sampling is needed to confirm the diagnosis in patients with high suspicion of MERS-CoV in the face of negative initial test results. The significance of positive RT-PCR (viral shedding) as it relates to infectivity is unclear, because most positive patients have positive results for up to 6 weeks. The required number of negative results to clear a positive patient is not known, given that RT-PCR can alternate between positive and negative results before it becomes negative.",

Specially assigned staff have been trained in nasopharyngeal sampling for MERS-CoV, and these are the only staff allowed to sample patients for MERS-CoV. Our results demonstrate the need for a minimum of 2 samples to confirm MERS-CoV, and that a third sample will increase the yield by only 1% (from 96.5% to 97.6%). Concerns about the infectivity of RT-PCR\u2212positive patients 16, 17 have been confirmed by a recent report of a positive MERS-CoV culture from the upper respiratory tract of an asymptomatic positive case from KSA obtained at 15 days after illness onset. 18 There is an urgent need to verify how many negative results are needed to confirm negativity. In our series, only 30% of patients had negative-positive-negative results necessitating confirmation of negativity. The KSA Ministry of Health recommends that \"two negative lower respiratory samples 24 hours apart are required for ventilated patients and one negative respiratory sample in other patients including home-isolated individuals.\" 19 We concur with the recent WHO guideline recommending 2 MERS-CoV \u2212negative samples obtained 1 week apart to ensure clearance. 20 This is particularly important because most MERS-CoV cases are linked to hospital transmission. 2 It is unfortunate that some alternative MERS-CoV testing methodologies, such as serology, have proved to be less reliable, whereas others, such as rapid point-of-care testing, have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Rapid, sensitive, and specific point-of-care tests have been reported but have yet to be validated in large samples in KSA. [21] [22] [23] A significant limitation of our study is the lack of comparative data on the value of lower respiratory tract vs upper respiratory tract sampling to confirm what other investigators have shown. 6, 7 ",

In addition, 2 negative results 48 hours apart with clinical improvement or stabilization are needed to clear patients of MERS-CoV. Evaluation of the yield of sputum samples is needed to assess the effectiveness of this approach compared with using nasopharyngeal swabs.",
