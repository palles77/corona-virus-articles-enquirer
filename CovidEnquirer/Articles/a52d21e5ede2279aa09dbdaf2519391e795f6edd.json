In the early days of blood banking, paying for blood donors was a commonplace and accepted practice. These donors were often motivated by a lack of funds to maintain drug or alcohol habits; subsequently, paid donors had a higher incidence of transfusiontransmissible diseases, particularly hepatitis, which infected many early blood recipients. In the 1970s, growing recognition of this problem 11 led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in its Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), to require blood from paid donors to be labeled as such. 12 As these \"paid donor\"-labeled units were considered to be undesirable by clinicians and hospitals, the practice of paid whole blood donations effectively died out.",

Despite studies demonstrating that these donors had infectious disease marker frequencies similar to, or better than, those of volunteer donors, these centers were eventually forced to cease paying plateletpheresis donors. 14 Paid donation, however, is regularly utilized for the recruitment of donors in the United States for commercial source plasma. This plasma is collected by apheresis and sent for further manufacture into various plasma-derived products. Because the pooled plasma from these donations is effectively \"sterilized\" during the fractionation and manufacturing process, there is less concern about the potentially increased risk for infectious disease transmission by using paid donors for \"source plasma.\" Most countries with all-volunteer commercial plasma programs have struggled, usually unsuccessfully, to meet their population's plasma derivative needs. 15",

There is still a concern that a potential donor might be untruthful about high-risk behaviors for infectious disease to receive a gift being offered at a blood collection site. For this reason, incentives should be provided for simply attending a blood drive and attempting to donate, rather than the gift being given based on the condition of the actual donation.",

The major impetus for autologous donation is the donor's perception of eliminating the risk of transfusion-transmitted viral disease, particularly HIV and hepatitis. Recognition of transfusion-transmitted HIV in the mid-1980s greatly increased the utilization of autologous donation, which was used less frequently before that time. Another benefit of autologous donation is minimization of exposure to allogeneic red cells and leukocyte antigens that may stimulate alloantibody formation and create future transfusion compatibility problems. Some literature also suggests that allogeneic blood transfusion can lead to modulation of the recipient's immune system. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Because the autologous donor is also the patient who will receive the donated product, deferral criteria are less stringent than for allogeneic blood donation. For example, the autologous donor can donate every 72 hours (and typically no less than 72 hours before surgery), rather than at an interval of at least 56 days. Similarly, the minimum hemoglobin level is lowered from 12.5 to 11 g/dL for autologous donors. When multiple autologous units are requested, it is best to begin donation a few weeks in advance of the upcoming surgery. In some cases, the donor is given supplemental iron or erythropoietin injections to maintain hemoglobin levels during the autologous donation process. 28 Collections staff who evaluate and draw autologous blood donors must have more extensive training than those who handle only routine donations. This is in part due to the fact that autologous donors tend to be older than allogeneic donors, resulting in more age-related health problems (which may thus increase the incidence of serious adverse reactions at the time of donation). The frequency of severe donor reactions requiring hospitalization, although quite low for all donors, is significantly higher among autologous donors than allogeneic donors (1 in 17,000 versus 1 in 200,000). 29 Blood center staff must also take into consideration the disease processes that made the elective surgeries necessary in the first place. Cardiac patients, for example, may have arrhythmias or symptoms of vascular disease. Orthopedic patients often have mobility problems that would adversely affect their donation experience. Blood collection staff screeners should be especially mindful of identifying those autologous donors who are at risk for ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, 30 and seizures.",

Individuals with evidence of bacterial infection should be deferred from donation until the condition is resolved.

Donors who have had recent procedures that could lead to a transient bacteremia, such as recent dental work or colonoscopy, are typically deferred for at least 24 hours. Improved screening and infectious disease testing have significantly minimized the infectious disease risks of allogeneic transfusion. However, many donors and physicians continue to request autologous donation as a transfusion option. Autologous donations require more complicated donor screening and collection procedures, associated logistical problems, and associated higher costs. The autologous unit must be specifically labeled for the designated patient, and systems must be in place in both the blood center and the hospital that will guarantee that the blood arrives at the proper place, in the right condition, and in time for surgery. Occasionally, autologous blood is not available for use, due to surgery being delayed beyond the expiration of the donated blood components or due to failure of proper communication between the collection center and the hospital staff. Positive infectious disease testing or clerical errors may also delay availability of autologous blood. At the hospital, care must be taken to transfuse autologous blood before allogeneic or directed donor blood. If an adverse effect is attributed to an allogeneic or directed unit that, arguably, would never have been transfused had the autologous unit been available for use and transfused first, medicolegal consequences may ensue.",

These units are allowed to expire at the hospital and must be discarded. \"Cross-over\" has been discouraged, in part, because, as a group, autologous donors have a higher frequency of infectious disease markers than regular allogeneic donors. 34 They may also have underlying disease conditions that would make them unacceptable as donors for allogeneic blood transfusion. Another factor making autologous units less desirable for allogeneic transfusion is the lower hematocrit acceptable for autologous donation, which does not meet allogeneic criteria and may provide a substandard (less potent) red cell product.",

Evidence presented by the College of American Pathologists (CAP) indicates that many transfusion services either do not test autologous blood for infectious disease markers or knowingly collect, store, and transfuse infectious units. 39 Although transfusion of these infected units may not present an obvious risk to the donor/patient, accidental needle-sticks and splatters do put blood handlers at risk. Accidental transfusion of an infected autologous unit to the wrong recipient is possible. Storage of infectious blood components in hospital blood banks also presents some risk to other patients, considering that at least 1 in every 25,000 blood products is transfused to the \"wrong\" individual. 40 In 1992, the CAP conducted a survey of 3852 hospital transfusion services and found that 34 (0.9%) had issued one or more autologous blood products to the wrong patient during the previous year, and that 20 of these units were actually transfused. 40 An analysis of 256 licensed transfusion services by The New York State Department of Health, from 1990 through 1998, indicated that 1 in 19,000 RBC units where transfused to the wrong patient or were of incorrect ABO group or Rh type. 41 In addition, preliminary data indicate the frequency of infectious disease markers among autologous donors is significantly higher than that of allogeneic donors (Table 11-2) . This data, along with the decreasing benefits of autologous transfusion due to improved infectious disease testing of allogeneic blood, make the practice of storing and transfusing infected units less attractive to hospital transfusion services.",

In recent years, methods of computerized data entry have become more common. 57 Several blood centers have investigated the use of an abbreviated donor history questionnaire (aDHQ) for repeat donors. The aDHQ eliminates nonrepeatable event questions; identifies recent changes in health, travel, or behavior; and retains questions about risk-associated activities that might have changed since the last donation. Data presented to the FDA Blood Products Advisory Committee on March 18, 2005 , showed that a significant number of donors desire faster processing with a less complicated interview. This data demonstrated no indication that the abbreviated questionnaire increases blood safety risk. 58 At this time, the FDA has not accepted the aDHQ and has requested that the AABB Donor History Task Force develop a pre-implementation study of the aDHQ (currently in progress).",

Although sophisticated infectious disease testing methodologies have significantly reduced the rate of transfusion-transmitted viral disease, the window period (the time during which a recently infected donor is infectious but tests negative for infectious disease markers) contributes to a low-level risk. The introduction of sensitive nucleic acid amplification technology (NAT) has shortened the window period for HCV and HIV, when compared to previous HCV and HIV antibody or HIV p24 antigen testing.

Besides blood transfusion and accidental needle-sticks, other sources of blood exposure include human bites and acupuncture, tattoos, and piercings performed with nonsterile instruments. Nonsterile body piercing (including ears) has become increasingly problematic in recent years due to the increase in popularity of piercings and tattoos.

A 2-week deferral is required of recipients of rubeola (measles), polio (Sabin/oral), mumps, typhoid (oral), and yellow fever vaccines. Individuals vaccinated for exposure to HBV or rabies are deferred for 12 months to avoid the remote possibility of disease transmission. The American Red Cross requires a 7-day deferral period for routine (not exposure-related) HBV vaccination; the deferral time varies among different organizations. Vaccination with nonviable agents such as toxoids and nonviable antigenic material requires no deferral. Donors who are vaccinated with experimental vaccines should be carefully evaluated and deferred for at least 12 months if there is any doubt as to the safety of the agent. 71 The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States and subsequent attacks of anthrax, real or hoax, through the postal system created concern about bioterrorism.

Underweight donors are particularly likely among younger individuals, who also have a higher incidence of adverse donation reactions than older individuals. 75, 76 Although the weight is generally noted from the history, it is wise to actually weigh those donors who appear to be underweight.

This situation may arise at an institutional blood drive or with directed donations for a friend or family member. The donor may deny risk factors, such as homosexuality or drug abuse, for fear that a breach of confidentiality might allow this behavior to become widely known. The confidential unit exclusion (CUE) provides the opportunity for a donor to request, with confidentiality guaranteed, that unacceptable donated blood not be used for transfusion. This procedure is accomplished by affording the donor a CUE card containing the unit number and a means of indicating, if necessary, that the unit not be used for transfusion. The CUE is then placed in a locked box to be reviewed at a later time, at which time excluded units are earmarked for destruction. In addition, centers can provide a designated telephone number so that a donor can call back with additional information, when necessary, that would exclude a unit for transfusion. When first used, the infectious disease marker frequency of units designated for nonuse by CUE was significantly higher than other units: as many as 20% of anti-HIV positive units would have been diverted from transfusion due to the CUE. 80 Improved donor education, infectious disease testing, and screening techniques have made the CUE a less valuable tool. [81] [82] [83] Many CUEs are the result of donors misunderstanding the CUE directions and inadvertently checking the wrong box. 84, 85 For this reason, after investigation, some centers will destroy an excluded unit but will continue to allow the donor to donate blood. 86",

It is recommended that one consult the manufacturer's package insert for specific dosage guidelines. [99] [100] [101] Corticosteroids are usually given as prednisone or dexamethasone. The latter is given as a dose of 8 to 12 mg, depending on the donor's weight, at intervals of 4 and 12 hours before the collection procedure. A uniform dose of 450 \u03bcg of G-CSF coupled with 8 mg of dexamethasone, both given 12 hours before collection, has been shown to be as effective as larger combined doses. 102 Producing a granulocytapheresis product that is not heavily contaminated with RBCs has also been a challenge. The density of granulocytes is only slightly lower than that of RBCs, which makes it difficult to produce a clean separation. RBCs in the granulocyte product must be compatible with the recipient to avoid the possibility of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. To help remedy the problem of red cell contamination, differential sedimentation is enhanced by use of rouleaux-inducing agents. Both hetastarch and pentastarch are employed for this purpose, although hetastarch is more widely used for its higher granulocyte yields. 103 Hetastarch, however, is less rapidly cleared from the body and accumulates more readily in the extravascular space, which can lead to localized edema, headache, and fluid retention in repeat donors, often family members, who donate regularly over a period of several days. It may be wise to use reduced dosages for frequent donors to help avoid these effects. These adverse effects tend to be less of a problem for infrequent donors and with collections using pentastarch. Although traces of hetastarch may be detected in the donor for years, there has been no demonstrated clinical significance. Combined premedication with G-CSF, dexamethasone, and collection with the use of hetastarch have been reported to provide a product with a granulocyte yield of 4.1 to 10.8 \u00d7 10 10 compared to 2.1 to 2.6 \u00d7 10 10 using dexamethasone alone. 104 Granulocytapheresis products should be administered at least daily to an adult patient to achieve a physiologic dose, and this must be repeated for a number days. This requirement creates serious logistical problems and is one reason why (along with the cost) granulocytapheresis is not more frequently utilized. Improved antibiotic therapy and the high incidence of adverse effects in the recipients of granulocytapheresis products, including pulmonary reactions and leukocyte alloimmunization, have further decreased the functionality of this therapy. 105, 106 ",

A Class III recall is a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. Examples of products in this category might be those that do not meet FDA labeling regulations. A market withdrawal occurs when a product has a minor violation that would not be subject to FDA legal action. The firm removes the product from the market or corrects the violation. For example, a product removed from the market due to tampering, without evidence of manufacturing or distribution problems, would be a market withdrawal.",
