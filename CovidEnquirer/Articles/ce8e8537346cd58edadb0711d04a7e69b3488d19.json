Over decades, it expanded to include surveillance, prevention, and control of non-communicable diseases, injuries, and birth defects as well as occupational and environmental health. The CDC has been increasingly involved in global health activities since the 1950s. Emergency prepared ness and response, always a core function, received increased attention after the 9/11 World Trade Center and anthrax attacks. CDC's role in the US health-care system continues to evolve with the passage of health-reform legislation and increased focus on prevention through clinical care.",

But if an NPHI is seen as being too independent, it might not be able to address important health challenges. A related issue is whether the entity has regulatory authority-the US CDC has limited regulatory authority but provides guidance to other federal agencies and state and local public health agencies which have more. In other countries, the role of the NPHI can include regulation of pharmaceutical production or sale, and of medical care.",

Increasing the number, scope, and eff ectiveness of NPHIs in developing countries will enable better prevention and control of infectious diseases and reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases and injuries. Success will depend on accurate collection, analysis, and dissemination of data to implement and monitor evidence-based programmes. NPHIs require more staff and resources, although on a much smaller scale than the need for additional clinical personnel. Stronger NPHIs enable countries to implement and monitor health programmes that save money and lives by basing decisions on country-specifi c data on health burden, effi cacy of interventions, and implementation status of health programmes. To improve both health and health systems, developing countries need to greatly increase resources and authority of NPHIs.",
