Industry was serving the needs of military preparedness and expanding commercial inventiveness: both required adequate security measures, though of differing sorts. Such diverse interests in proprietary security were met, in 1955, with the founding of the American Society for Industrial Security, now ASIS International. 3 early members of ASIS were employed usually as loss control directors serving for-profit and institutional organizations. Typically, they would be concerned about physical security, emergency response planning and coordination, and internal investigations. Members who worked for industrial corporations that provided products, systems, services, and research for government, especially the military and intelligence community, faced extensive compliance requirements to protect information and production know-how from possible compromise. ASIS members in those early years included many retired military officers. Membership also consisted of retired police officers, special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement organizations, and persons who became responsible for security without having had any previous formal preparation in the military or law enforcement.",

A security program is often thought by managers not involved with protection to be a \"cost\" to the operation, not a source of \"profit.\" This is an unacceptable characterization for security endeavors. However, in some circumstances, security departments perform services that can generate fresh income for the organization that would otherwise be unavailable. For example, some workplaces share their own security services with other businesses or institutions and charge for them accordingly. Hence, they can become a true profit center for the parent organization (see Box 2.3). \u2022 Crime. Violent and property crime that could occur within or near a facility or property can be deterred by the presence of security personnel, the installation and functioning of an alarm and closed circuit/Internet Protocol television (CC/IPTV) system, and good security design. This is supported by research from situational crime prevention studies, which confirms that pertinent measures may reduce losses from crime and other risks. \u2022 Fear. The presence of trained security personnel and state-of-the-art systems makes employees, vendors, and visitors feel safer at the workplace. For example, the availability of a parking lot security patrol may reduce users' trepidation while it example, Alert personnel paraded dogs throughout pan Am's check-in counters for the media's cameras. However, according to Alert's first president, Fred Ford, they were not dogs trained to sniff for bombs; they were merely \"well-behaved german shepherds.\" Pan Am retained the services of a security consultancy, Ktalav Promotion and Investment Ltd. (KPI), to critique its performance and to review operations at Frankfurt and 24 other airports. Isaac Yeffet, a former security chief for El Al Airlines, then with KPI, wrote to the airline that: \"pan Am is highly vulnerable to most forms of terrorist attack,\" despite the existence of their own Alert Management, and that \"a bomb would have a good chance of getting through security\" at the Frankfurt Airport. Yeffet concluded: \"It appears, therefore, that Pan Am is almost totally vulnerable to a mid-air explosion through explosive charges concealed in the cargo.\" But Yeffet's report and Ford's request for more resources for Alert Management were ignored by Pan Am's senior management. The price of inadequate security would be high. On December 21, 1989 , Pan Am flight 103, a Boeing 747 jet, was blown apart over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard and an additional 11 on the ground.",

Organizations often are required to provide security services and systems for themselves because their property and casualty liability insurance coverage -or other specific insurance policies -mandate certain minimum protective measures. \u2022 Legal mandates. In some cases, specific litigation directly requires the presence of security operations. For example, financial institutions face general obligations to maintain a security program subsequent to the Bank Security Act of 1968 and as subsequently modified. \u2022 Bureaucratic requirements. Numerous governmental agencies create regulations that mandate the existence of security programs. usually, these are the outgrowth of federal laws that contain broad language and leave the specifics to be developed by a designated federal agency. For example, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires airport managers and airlines to institute a variety of protective measures, including preboard screening of airline passengers and personnel and vetting of checked luggage.

Notable among these was the Bank Security Act of 1968. \u00a7 This law was passed because bank crimes had grown steadily during the decade. The increased incidence of bank robberies, burglaries, and extortions prompted Congress to require all federally chartered banking institutions to undertake particular security measures to reduce the risk of successful criminal acts. In retrospect, the measure in itself did not reduce the growing pattern of violent and property crimes against financial institutions covered by the Act: in fact, they kept increasing for years after passage of the law. \u00b6 modified years later to make requirements more reflective of changing circumstances. For example, the original law of 1968 produced regulations for Minimum Security Devices and Procedures (12CFR21). These included specific language related to antitheft technology, which became less relevant with the introduction of new and better cameras and recording media. By the 1990s, bankers possessed greater latitude with regards to designing security systems most appropriate for their needs. While the Bank Security Act is not directly associated with decreasing bank crime patterns, common sense argues that such institutions must implement reasonable security measures to protect employees and the public. perhaps without the vigorous measures that were instituted by this law, bank crime would have increased. This act is an example of the federal government passing a measure that demands a distinctive private sector security response. In the process this law aided the role of security management to grow as a management practice in a particular sphere, in this case financial industries. Other federal measures would follow.",

The next year, the total jumped to 40 incidents, of which 33 were successful. For the next 3 years, as the private and public sectors fought the trend, the number of attempted skyjackings on united States-scheduled aircraft held steady, while the number of successful incidents dropped from 17 in 1970 to 11 the next year, and then 8 in 1972. With implementation of control measures, skyjacking attempts dropped for the period 1973-1979 to 31, with only 3 being successful. The measures succeeded in reducing the risks of air piracy and restored confidence in travelers. This is a convincing example of how a coordinated security policy can reduce an international problem. However, risks to scheduled airport/airliner security had not been fully analyzed and reduced. ** The Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended.

The Act, also known as the Wagner Act, established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Title 29, Section 159, the US Labor Code. This measure was intended to help settle union-management disputes over unfair labor practices. This Act was amended in 1947 by the Taft-Hartley Act. The Taft-Hartley amendment passed during a time when strikes were a national concern. It provided for an 80-day cooling-off period if a strike could cause a national emergency. The effects of such a strike obviously would be exacerbated if unionized security guards joined their coworkers on the picket line. Therefore, Taft-Hartley Section 9(b)(3) provides that the NLRB may not certify an employment unit that includes guard and nonguard employees and, further, the NLRB may not, as a result of an election, certify as a representative of a unit of guards a union that admits nonguards to membership. Thus, unions exclusively for guards were created. These tended to be small and regional.",

In the 1970s the Allied International Union numbered 700 security guards as members. The union was purchased for $90,000 by a rogue Daniel Cunningham. The union's constitution and bylaws permitted the incoming president to elect his own officers and appoint a successor; therefore, members had no right to vote or state any opinion authoritatively on relevant issues. 9 Cunningham demanded and received indirect payoffs from local and national security guard companies. During this time he organized the guards in industries where the loss of security personnel could be critical: casinos and nuclear power plants. Meanwhile, the venal labor boss stole from funds in the union's treasury. eventually, Cunningham was convicted on several labor racketeering charges brought by the New York State Organized Crime Task Force. 10 unions that admitted guards and nonguards to membership (mixed unions) were not prohibited if the employer voluntarily agreed to recognize such a union. This has occurred throughout the country and over many years. NLRB Section 9(b)(3) limits mixed unions from representing both workers generally and security personnel, unless the employer has no objection. Otherwise during a union organizing process, the NLRB cannot direct an election in a unit that includes guards and nonguards. But nothing prevents guards from filing unfair labor practice charges against employers with the NLRB. Further, future elimination of the section is conceivable legislatively that would ease possibilities for large employers to recognize large unions in the same workplace.",

Investigators today are much more likely to conduct evaluations to make sure that corporate policies are maintained, such as by assuring that licensing fees and payments are properly documented. Investigators are frequently integral in due diligence fact-finding (i.e., the vigilant care needed in a given situation) prior to acquiring an asset or related to litigation involving the organization. This category of contracted service continues to grow in importance for proprietary security programs. 4. Armored car services. ever since Washington perry Brink started his transport business with a horse and a wagon in the nineteenth century, customers have turned to outside organizations to physically move assets. In addition to transporting cash, these services may provide activities such as the servicing of automated teller machines (ATMs) and the transporting of high-value noncash assets such as jewelry and computer tapes and documents. They also handle aspects of cash management for financial organizations removing such services from traditional bank services. 5. Consultant and other services. When particular problems emerge, security operations managers often turn to consultants with special expertise in particular activities. Most major industries and most types of specific security concerns -for example, data protection and financial investigations -can retain the services of such persons or their organizations for a defined period of time to achieve the desired goals. Due to the shrinking of central staff management in the past 25 years, managerial resources were reduced and the use of outside consultants replaced in-house management capabilities on an as-needed basis. Meanwhile, other services are equally significant to organizations. For example, in the event of a loss of computer processing capability, an organization may turn to facilities that have compatible hardware that may be commandeered for immediate use. 6. Electronic security equipment and systems. To provide more control at less cost, managers turn to electronic security equipment, which can augment, supplement, and verify the actions of security personnel. Though smaller than personnel-intensive services, capital outlay for such equipment is growing steadily. The ways these funds are allocated are given as follows: a. Intrusion detection equipment. These devices and systems indicate the unauthorized passage of individuals into a protected area. b. Vehicle security systems. These products deter and detect the theft or removal of cars, trucks, vans, and other mobile conveyances. c. Computer security equipment. Because of the importance of data protection, systems to protect information assets are growing at a substantial rate and play an important role in loss deterrence for data systems. d. CC/IPTV equipment. Security operations increasingly use CC/IPTV systems to monitor, analyze, and record activities. (This is also called video surveillance technology.) e. Fire detection equipment. Facilities are required to use fire detection systems by codes, standards, insurance requirements, or common sense. f. Electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems. These systems are primarily used to control the losses of retail merchandise. However, eAS systems also may be applied to broader applications of assets control. g. Access control equipment. Systems to efficiently allow or deny entrance make an important contribution to operating a secure facility. This category is closely related technically to intrusion detection equipment. h. Secure telephone equipment. This equipment protects telephone and data transmissions from unauthorized interception. i. X-ray inspection equipment. X-ray impressions may identify the presence of weapons or contraband material hidden in packages or on persons. j. Metal detection equipment. These systems identify metal content hidden within packages or on persons. Wide applications are found at airport preboard screening and the checking of people and hand parcels entering at-risk locations. k. Biological, nuclear, and chemical detection. Still another way of identifying contraband is the use of technology to identify the chemical signatures of such materials. These may result in an alarm being sounded or in a security officer setting aside a suspicious object for further evaluation. 7. Mechanical security hardware. In addition to personnel and electronic devices, systems, and software, security operations often require the purchase and use of particular products and materials. Hence, any object or material that is not electronic is categorized as mechanical security hardware. This category also is substantial, and projected to grow along with construction needs. While electronic products and systems are in the spotlight, mechanical locks continue to have sufficient applications to assure their continuance. This category includes safes, vaults, glazing, and other products specifically marketed for their protective features. A door that is required to be intrusion-resistant would be included in this category; a normal door would not be. Locking devices including door locks, padlocks, deadbolts, latches, as well as security storage equipment such as safes and vaults and fire extinguishers, and related products are also included in this category.",

            "text": "Crisis management and response: political unrest/regional instability/national disasters (evacuation potential) understanding of the security vulnerabilities, these few can cause substantial losses of assets. \u2022 Crisis management and response: domestic terrorism. risk exposures can occur at home and abroad. The security practitioner has the duty to qualify and manage threats and vulnerabilities. 15 Organizations that operate in nations where there are risks to employees and assets require constant monitoring. Optimal security operations must seek to assess the risks in various nations. They must further stay abreast of any changing conditions that could lead to threats to employees or expropriations of assets. In the event of an emergency, security planners must attempt to remove employers safely from harm's way. \u2022 Unethical business conduct. In many circumstances, one of the tasks for security operations is to play varying roles in drafting, monitoring, and enforcing an organizational code of ethical conduct. 16 \u2022 Identity theft. In a recent year almost 12 million persons were victimized by the effects from identity theft in the united States. The crime has no borders, so victims are found globally. Workplaces are impacted when merchandise is transported to perpetrators or their agents. 17 \u2022 Environmental/social pandemics (e.g., Ebola virus). ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SArS), and other viral attacks impact the workplace, although immediate risks are few. Typically, organizations plan on how to conduct operations as close to normal as possible in the unlike event that a pandemic hits close to home. In 2014, security directors of global organizations prepared contingency plans in the event that operations or supply chain activity was interrupted by the ebola virus. \u2022 Crisis management and response: political unrest/regional instability/national disaster (evacuation potential). The supply chain can be shut down if a key material, part, or assembly cannot be delivered due to an interruption. Security practitioners have roles in assuring that, as far as possible, alternative resources are available. Similarly, some security programs have 24/7 active monitoring of global conditions where the organization operates. \u2022 Litigation: inadequate security. The reality or fear of legal action for negligence is one of the driving features in security management today. Security program operators are involved in a variety of activities related to these risks, including instituting procedures and controls to reduce such risks and preparing actions or defenses for legal cases. 18 \u2022 Fraud/white-collar crime. The term \"white-collar crime\" was coined by the sociologist edwin Sutherland, and signifies unlawful, nonviolent conduct committed by corporations and individuals. It includes theft, fraud, and other violations of trust, including embezzlement. embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of property by one lawfully entrusted with its possession. Frequently, this crime is committed by someone with a fiduciary responsibility within the organization, which he or she then abuses. The investigation and prevention of fraud (i.e., false representation or intentional perversion of truth to induce another to part with something valuable) is an important task in any organization.",

Training that informs workers on what they can and cannot do can mitigate claims. risk analysis further lowers workplace vulnerability to lawsuits. 19 \u2022 Substance abuse (drugs/alcohol in the workplace). employee drug testing is widely used in industry. policies, procedures, consent forms, checklists, and training materials are needed for such programs. 20 \u2022 Business espionage/theft of trade secrets. For many organizations, the loss of crucial information is of greater importance than the fraudulent disappearance of products or supplies. These transgressions include espionage or theft of trade secrets, including developmental procedures and know-how. \u2022 Environmental/social robberies. robberies are categorized as the third most significant crime in the hierarchy of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports. robbery is the taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of someone. Force or threat of force of violence and putting the victim in fear is a characteristic of this crime. robbery mitigation is likely to succeed when risk mitigation is put into place. \u2022 Intellectual property/brand protection/product counterfeiting. The brand, product, and information of an organization are precious assets. Intellectual property can walk out the door or be accessed through a few keystrokes. Security practitioners are interested in preventing this loss and also investigating possible incursions early on to lessen the damage. 21 \u2022 Global supply chain security. The stealing of goods that are being transported or stored is an ongoing concern for product manufacturers and distributors. 22 Outright theft requires prompt investigation and response. Broad transportation issues include container tracking and transit point security. \u2022 Executive protection (including travel security). The protection of senior officials from risk has become a highly evolved skill that draws upon management planning and analysis. 23 protection choreography, advance security preparations, domestic and international travel assessment, and physical training are all involved in the process. \u2022 Insurance/workers' compensation fraud. Organizations that provide workers' compensation insurance sometimes encounter abuse, which requires investigation and response. A security program is generally tasked with investigating other incidents concerning insurance claims. \u2022 Crisis management and response: international terrorism. The bombings of the World Trade Center, the Boston Marathon, the Oklahoma City federal building, and public and private assets in various locales domestically and globally suggest the importance of measures to deter such attacks. 24 As a global activity, security planners look at risks from unstable parts of the world, and political risks from groups such as ISIS (or ISIL) that could destabilize the world and affect conventional operations. \u2022 Bombings/bomb threats. Bombings in the workplace are rare. Bomb threats are frequent. Security practitioners devise strategies to analyze and deal with threats as they are received.",

These skills include program initiation, ongoing monitoring, and constant endeavors to improve performance. Corporate security endeavors are still new, having been the focus of independent research only in recent decades. yet the reasons for the growth of such services involve diverse psychological, legal, social, and financial requisites. politics and federal and state laws have helped shape security services. The horrific events of 9/11 and legislation passed since then have provided a reshaping of what the public sector expects from private security. The changing priorities of security practitioners in large corporations focus on workplace violence, crisis management, and executive protection, although the nature of those concerns differs according to the particular industry of the corporation.Discussion and Review 1. Why are some operational contingencies considered \"core?\" What would be an example of a noncore competency? 2. Why was the Rand Report so influential on security practices? Is it pejorative to refer to private security services as \"private police?\" 3. What factors are most important in driving the growth of security services and programs? 4. Describe federal laws that have helped form security practices. 5. How have the events following 9/11 reshaped private security? 6. What are the differential rates of growth of security services, electronics, and hardware? Why would these grow at different rates? 7. Corporate security managers place workplace violence at or near the top of their concerns. Is this likely to change? What factors could influence different types of industries to report different security priorities? ",
