The aim of this study was to investigate if disinfection of calf pens with hydrated lime would reduce contamination of C. parvum oocysts and improve calf health in herds with C. parvum associated diarrhea problems. Four dairy herds with ongoing C. parvum associated calf diarrhea problems each participated in the study over six to seven months. During the study period, all pens/huts for young calves were cleaned according to the usual farm routine before a new calf entered. Hydrated lime was then used to disinfect half of the pens/huts. Diarrhea incidence was recorded by the farmers and by veterinarians, who clinically examined the calves every second month. In total, 402 calves participated in the study. The farmers detected diarrhea in 214 (53%) calves, with similar proportions in calves kept in lime disinfected and control pens. Age at diarrhea onset was significantly higher in lime disinfected pens than in control pens, 9.0 days and 7.6 days, respectively. There was no difference between the groups regarding duration or severity index recorded by the farmers. The body condition score in 6-8 week old calves was significantly higher in calves that had been kept in lime disinfected pens during their first weeks of life, indicating that calves in disinfected pens/huts were less affected by their infections.",

            "text": "Diarrhea is a significant health problem in young calves, and the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum is one of the major infectious causes of calf diarrhea worldwide (Blanchard, 2012; Thomson et al., 2017) . Clinical cryptosporidiosis is mostly seen in calves up to six weeks of age and the most prominent clinical symptoms are watery diarrhea, inappetence, depression, and sometimes death (Robertson et al., 2014) . Co-infection with other pathogens or presence of noninfectious diarrheal causes can lead to more severe disease. Oocysts, the infective stage of the parasite, are excreted with the faeces and an infected individual can shed millions of oocysts per gram faeces (Uga completely prevent or cure disease (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009a; Almawly et al., 2013; Meganck et al., 2015) . Thus, sanitation is still the most important tool in disease prevention. However, the parasite is resistant to all commonly used chemical disinfectants, making it particularly difficult to control (Fayer, 2008) . Hydrated lime, or calcium hydroxide, can be used to sanitise animal facilities from bacteria and viruses (Kristula et al., 2008; Anonymous, 2009) . It has been shown that hydrated lime decreases the viability of C. parvum in the laboratory (Zintl et al., 2010) , and when hydrated lime disinfection of the calf pens was used as a complement to the standard cleaning procedures in two Swedish herds with long-lasting cryptosporidiosis problems, the farmers reported a lower incidence and less severe diarrhea in the calves (C. Ax\u00e9n personal communication). Recently, Matsuura et al. (2017) reported about a successful sanitation of a herd that for about 10 years had experienced severe calf diarrhea problems due to mixed C. parvum and Giardia intestinalis infections. They emptied the calf stable, removed bedding and faecal matter, let the pens dry for several days and then washed them with boiling water, coated them with milk of lime, and exchanged all wooden boards dividing the pens. During the two-year period following the sanitation no calves died and no C. parvum oocysts or G. intestinalis cysts were found (Matsuura et al., 2017) . This indicates that hydrated lime disinfection might be an effective control measure in cattle herds.",

Inclusion criteria were that i) the herd had a prevailing calf diarrhea problem for at least two months, ii) more than 20% of the calves developed diarrhea before three weeks of age, and iii) C. parvum, but not rotavirus or coronavirus, had been detected in calves from the herd. Furthermore, the herd should not use hydrated lime or other chemicals for disinfection of the calf pens, and the design of the calf facilities should allow arrangement of calf pens into a treatment and a control section. Preferably, the calves should be housed individually until they reached four weeks, but at least until two weeks, of age. Potential experimental herds were identified by field veterinarians at V\u00e4xa Sverige, an advisory and AI service company with knowledge about calf health in dairy herds in the different regions of Sweden. Based on clinical findings and laboratory diagnostic results, the field veterinarians considered C. parvum to be the main cause of the diarrhea problem in these herds. Only herds that fulfilled all requirements were included in the study. Several herds had to be excluded because they already used hydrated lime, and few herds kept their calves in individual pens longer than one week. Owners of potential experimental herds were interviewed by one of the authors (CS) about management and health of the pre-weaned calves using a predefined questionnaire. Before it was finally decided if a herd could be included, faecal samples were collected from five calves under three weeks of age and analysed for presence of Cryptosporidium spp., rotavirus and coronavirus. Only herds in which Cryptosporidium spp., but no rotavirus or coronavirus, was found were accepted.",

At the first visit the magnitude of the calf diarrhea problem and the feeding and cleaning routines were recorded. The veterinarian and the farmer together decided how the pens/huts used for newborn calves should be divided into experimental and control areas, and how the calves should be distributed between the pens. In herds one to three, cleaning routines meant that all pens/huts forming one row in the stable were cleaned at the same time. In these herds, three to nine consecutively born calves were therefore allocated to experimental and control pens/huts, respectively. In herd four, every other calf born was put in an experimental and a control pen, respectively. The farmers themselves decided which area was used as experimental and control. This was, as far as possible, kept unknown to the veterinarian. The farmers were instructed to clean all pens/huts according to their usual farm routine before a new calf was entered. In the experimental pens/huts a thin layer of hydrated lime should then be spread onto the walls and floor. The recommendation was to use no more than 40 g hydrated lime to coat both floor and walls of a 1.5m 2 pen. Farmers were instructed to apply the lime while the surface was still damp after washing in order to allow the lime to attach to the walls. If the farm routine did not include cleaning using water, a small volume of water was to be sprinkled onto the walls and floor before the hydrated lime was applied. The lime was allowed to work for a minimum of 24 h and farmers were instructed to brush the walls before the pen/ hut was bedded and a new calf introduced. The control pens were to be left empty for at least 24 h after cleaning before a new calf was entered.",

Samples containing C. parvum were subtyped through partial amplification (\u223c800 bp) of the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene using the same PCR mixture as for 18S but with primers described in (Alves et al., 2003) . 18S reaction conditions were 95\u00b0C for three minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 61\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s, with a two minutes extension at 72\u00b0C after the last cycle. Two \u03bcl were used as templates for the second reaction using the same reaction conditions, except that the annealing temperature was raised to 63\u00b0C. The gp60 annealing temperature was 52\u00b0C in the first PCR and 55\u00b0C in the second. Achieved sequences were compared with sequences deposited in GenBank using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST, NCBI http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi).",

In problem herds we can suspect a particularly high infection load, which is a challenge to any disinfectants. Furthermore, Zintl et al. (2010) concluded that in order to avoid reinfection, disinfection would have to be repeated at times when the pens were unoccupied. In the present study, disinfection was repeated, and each pen was unoccupied when coated. However, the barns were not emptied and cleaned before the start of lime disinfection. Lime disinfection was only added as a complement to the ordinary cleaning routines and was started during the housing season, when the infection load was already high. Cleaning routines and the quality of the equipment in the calf barns varied among the experimental herds. For example, in one herd the pens were not cleaned with water between each calf, and in another herd the boards dividing the pens were worn and difficult to clean. It has been suggested that components in cattle faeces enhance the oocysts' resistance to environmental stress (Robertson et al., 1992) , and remnants of faecal material might have impaired the effect of the lime. We could speculate that the disinfection might have been more effective if the barn had been vacated, thoroughly cleaned, and allowed to dry for several days before the start of lime disinfection, as described by Matsuura et al.

Total protein content in blood serum can be used to estimate colostrum uptake; concentrations below 55 g/l are considered to indicate failure of passive transfer (Tyler et al., 1999) . In contrast, higher concentrations are associated with improved calf health (Waldner and Rosengren, 2009; Furman-Fratczak et al., 2011) . Although the mean serum protein value was above 55 g/l at both serum samplings, all herds had individual calves with lower total protein values, and only 5 of 27 calves had IgG values above 60 g/L, indicating suboptimal colostrum feeding that may have rendered the calves particularly susceptible to cryptosporidial infections.",

However, in Swedish herds without diarrhea problems, C. bovis is the major species seen in young calves (Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2010; Silverl\u00e5s and Blanco-Penedo, 2013 ). The C. parvum subtype IIaA16G1R1b that was found in three of the herds is the most common subtype in Sweden, both in cattle and in humans. It was, for example, the subtype involved in a recent outbreak among veterinary students in Sweden (GenBank: EU647728) (Kinross et al., 2015) . The IIaA16G1R1b_variant is not as common and is slightly different from IIaA16G1R1b: the TCG repeat is in a different position in the repeat region. It was first seen in Sweden in 2015 when it was identified in children who had fallen sick after visiting dairy herds at public events held on the occasion of letting the cows out on pasture for the first time in spring (Anonymous, 2016) . The sequence is published (GenBank: KT895368.1).",
