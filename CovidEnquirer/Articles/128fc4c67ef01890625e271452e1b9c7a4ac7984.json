An effective and affordable therapy to achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease is urgently needed. Pegylated interferon-alpha 2a (IFN-a) is recommended for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in the current consensus guidelines of many countries. Compared with conventional recombinant IFN-a, however, pegylated IFN-a alone or in combination with nucleoside analogues does not significantly increase the rate of sustained response [2, 3] . Nucleos(t)ide analogues, such as, entecavir and tenofovir, suppress HBV replication and result in the improvement of liver architecture. However, these agents cannot eradicate HBV genomes from the liver and may further limited by the development increasingly select drug-resistant mutants with prolonged use [4, 5] . Therapy with additional antiviral drugs targeting other steps in the viral life cycle, in combination with immunomodulatory options, might be more beneficial and effective.",

In the prevaccination era, HBV infections were endemic due to frequent mother to child transmission in large regions of the world. However, there are still estimated 240 million chronic HBV carriers today and ca. 620,000 patients die per year due to HBV-related liver diseases. Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-\u03b1 and/ or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to satisfactory results. Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunomodulation may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence. Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients with or without therapeutic reduction of viral load did not result in effective immune control of HBV infection, suggesting that combination of antiviral treatment with new formulations of therapeutic vaccines is needed. The woodchuck (Marmota monax) and its HBV-like woodchuck hepatitis virus are a useful preclinical animal model for developing new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections. Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments using nucleos(t)ide analogues, with primeboost vaccination using DNA vaccines, new hepadnaviral antigens or recombinant adenoviral vectors were tested in the woodchuck model. In this review, we summarize these encouraging results obtained with these therapeutic vaccines. In addition, we present potential innovations This article is part of the special issue \"Therapeutic vaccination in chronic hepatitis B-approaches, problems and new perspectives\".",

Immunogenic complexes (IC) stimulate robust T cell responses by increasing uptake of HBsAg through Fc receptors on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and, therefore, enhance HBsAg processing and presentation. It was demonstrated that this vaccine administered to HBeAg-positive patients led to decrease of HBV DNA in serum and HBeAg seroconversion in some subjects [19] . In a phase II B clinical trial, HBeAg seroconversion was observed in about 21.6 % of treated patients. Moreover, a moderate decrease in serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels was observed after treatment [20, 21] . Very recently, a large phase III clinical trial with 12 injections of IC complex failed to show any therapeutic efficacy when compared to the placebo control injected only with alum [22] . Overstimulation with IC-based vaccine did not increase but decreased efficacy of the therapeutic vaccination.

WHV was found to be closely related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) [30] and classified as the second member of the genus ortho-hepadnavirus, family hepadnaviridae. In contrast to HBV-associated HCC in patients without a preferred integration site of HBV DNA, a frequent integration of the WHV genome close to the N-myc and c-myc gene has been observed in woodchucks developing HCC [31] . Infections of woodchucks with WHV have been shown to be endemic in the Mid-Atlantic States of the USA, whereas in the State of New York and New England woodchucks are rarely infected with WHV. Recently, a Chinese marmot Marmota himalayana was found to be susceptible to WHV infection [32] (Fig. 1 This review is focusing on the characterization of woodchuck genes related to innate and adaptive response, the recent development of new tools to determine virusspecific T cell response, therapeutic vaccines, and finally immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory approaches to treat chronic WHV infection. These new findings in this preclinical model will help the development of new strategies to treat chronic HBV infection in patients.",

In patients, IFN has been used in the treatment of CHB for many years. Therefore, the IFN system has also been characterized in woodchucks. Woodchuck IFN-\u03b1 was shown to reduce WHV surface antigen expression in a dose-dependent fashion in WHV-infected woodchuck hepatocytes [62] . The woodchuck IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 system and their expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from na\u00efve and WHV-infected woodchucks have also been studied [63] . The woodchuck IFN-\u03b1 genes could be classified into ten subtypes and three pseudotypes. Poly(I:C) stimulation on na\u00efve woodchuck PBLs could induce IFN-\u03b1 subtypes one, four and five production, indicating a selective expression of woodchuck IFN-\u03b1 subtypes. Moreover, PBLs from chronically WHV-infected woodchucks showed a reduced ability to produce woodchuck IFN when stimulated with poly(I:C). The complete or partial sequences of the type I IFN receptors (IFNARs) of woodchucks were also obtained and analysed by Fan et al. [64] . IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 stimulation significantly upregulated IFNAR2 expression in primary woodchuck hepatocytes. A decreased IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 expression was observed in woodchucks chronically infected with WHV. These data are essential for studying type I IFN-related innate immunity and therapy in hepadnaviral infection in the woodchuck model. IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine acting on a variety of immune cells through its cell surface receptor (IL-10R). It has been suggested to resuscitate antiviral immunity by interfering with IL-10/IL-10R pathway. An increased production of IL-10 was observed in patients with CHB [65] , which hints that blockade of IL-10R might become a feasible therapeutic approach for CHB. Very recently, Jiang et al.",

Therefore, sequence information of woodchuck CD3, CD4 and CD8 has been used to determine the kinetic of the influx of T cells into the liver during incubation period and acute or chronic WHV infection. In week two post-infection, an influx of CD3+ lymphocytes could be observed and reached higher levels prior and during the recovery phase. The peak level of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells coincided with recovery. During transient infection, T cells can accumulate in the liver and reach up to two-thirds of the total number of liver cells [35] . In the adaptive immune response, CD28 and CTLA-4 are known to play important roles for the regulation of T cell activation by delivering costimulatory signals. The complete coding regions of woodchuck CD28 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have been cloned and sequenced [68] . Woodchuck CD28 showed a similarity of 76 and 70 % to its human and mouse homologues, respectively, according to the deduced amino acid sequences. Woodchuck CTLA-4 has a higher similarity of 86 and 75 % to the corresponding human and mouse CTLA-4 molecules, respectively. The strict conservation of critical amino acid residues like cysteine and asparagine residues in woodchuck CD28 and CTLA-4 suggests that both molecules may structurally resemble their human or mouse homologues. A hexapeptide motif MYPPPY which has been supposed to be essential for the interaction with CD80 is present in both woodchuck CD28 and CTLA-4 [68] .",

Liu et al. have also performed de novo woodchuck transcriptome assembly by using deep sequencing technology (unpublished data). With the help of this advanced technology, sequence information of important immune genes such as APOBEC3 of woodchucks has been revealed. It has been shown that upregulation of APOBEC3 led to specific and non-hepatotoxic degradation of nuclear HBV cccDNA [70] . Therefore, future cloning and characterizing of APOBEC3 in the woodchuck model will evaluate the therapeutic potential for CHB.

The pioneer investigations with therapeutic vaccines based on WHV core [73] or surface [76, 77] reporting that the T cell response to HBV was successfully restored in patients treated with lamivudine. In addition, the quantity of antigen particularly the WHV surface antigen (WHsAg) to which the immune system is exposed can induce different degrees of functional impairment of antiviral T cells, up to physical T cell deletion [78, 79] . Combination therapy using lamivudine and serumderived WHsAg vaccination showed no effect on induction of anti-WHs antibodies or reduction of WHV DNA [80] . Our group evaluated the efficacy of the combination therapy in the woodchuck model by combining lamivudine treatment, DNA vaccination (three plasmids expressing WHsAg, WHcAg and woodchuck IFN-\u03b3) and WHsAg/ anti-WHs immunogenic complexes vaccination [81] . The triple combination led to a decrease in WHV viral load up to 2.9 log, in serum WHsAg up to 92 % and in development of anti-WHs antibodies. Nevertheless, these effects were not sustained and all parameters reached the baseline levels shortly after withdrawal of lamivudine treatment. In addition, the vaccination did not induce WHV-specific T cell responses in the majority of woodchucks, even in animals that exhibited virological responses. Later, we modified this protocol by using the more potent antiviral drug entecavir (ETV) and increasing the number of the immunizations (with plasmids expressing WHsAg and WHcAg from three to six) (Lu et al., unpublished results). A significant delay of the rebound of viremia was observed in woodchucks which received additional vaccination, compared to controls treated only with ETV. In another study, chronic WHV carriers received a treatment of the potent antiviral drug clevudine in combination with an alumadsorbed WHsAg vaccine. Combination treatment resulted in significant and sustained reduction of WHV DNA loads and WHsAg concentrations in most treated animals. Compared to vaccination alone, combination treatment induced a more robust anti-WHs response [82, 83] .",

However, even single immunization with recombinant adenoviruses may induce immunity, predominantly neutralizing antibodies, against the vector itself. This negative effect of the adenovirusinduced immunity against the vaccine may be overcome by heterologous prime-boost regimen. In particular, subsequent priming immunizations with plasmid DNA vaccine followed by a booster vaccination with AdV seem to be a very promising strategy. DNA prime-adenovirus boost regimen proved to induce more robust and potent immune response in comparison with plasmid DNA alone and provided protection against the pathogen challenge in several animal models of infectious diseases [87] [88] [89] (see also article from E.

The increased antigen expression was achieved by insertion of an intron sequence in the expression cassette of the vaccines. Preliminary results showed that the new vaccines are able to induce strong and sustained WHcAg-specific T cell response in mice and na\u00efve woodchucks. Interestingly, immunization with AdVs led to rapid and massive production of anti-WHs antibodies and as a result resolution of infection after the WHV challenge [90] .",

WHsAg-and WHcAg-specific T-helper and cytotoxic T cell responses were detected in all chronic carriers that received immunizations, but not in ETV only treated animals.

In chronic HBV infections, upregulation of PD-1 on virus-specific T cells was observed, and restoration of the T cell function has been achieved by blocking the PD-1/PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) interaction in vitro [98] . Recently, the therapeutic effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has also been investigated for chronic HCV infection in chimpanzees [99] and in patients [100] . However, limited effect on restoring T cell function was observed in these studies which used only PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. It has been recently clarified that the proportion of CD8 T cells expressing PD-1 and the levels of PD-1 on virus-specific T cells are strongly correlated with viral load in the plasma [101] [102] [103] . Antiretroviral treatment resulted in the dramatic decline of plasma viral load, coincident with a decrease in the PD-1 expression level on virus-specific CD8 T cells [101, 103] . In line with this, a better restoration of T cell functions upon in vitro anti-PD-L1 treatment was observed in chronic HBV patients with lower viremia [104] .

            "text": "In line with these findings, Zhang et al. [105] and Liu et al. [93] successfully cloned and characterized the woodchuck PD-1/PD-L system in the WHV infection woodchuck model. A significant positive correlation between the viral load and the PD-1 expression on total CD8 T cells in chronic WHV infection was observed. Both the proportion of PD-1+ CD8 T cells and the levels of PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells were significantly higher in the woodchucks with chronic WHV infection compared to na\u00efve animals and resolvers. More importantly, during ETV treatment of those chronic carriers, a reduction of serum viral load was correlated with a dramatic decrease in the level of PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells [93] . In vitro blockade of woodchuck PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by using a rabbit polyclonal PD-L1 blocking antibody could partially restore the T cell function in WHV-infected woodchucks [105] . Moreover, in vivo blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway on CD8 T cells, in combination with nucleoside analogue treatment and DNA vaccination, synergistically enhanced the function of virus-specific T cells. The combination therapy potently suppressed WHV replication, leading to sustained immunological control of viral infection, anti-WHs antibody development and complete viral clearance in some woodchucks [93] . Although similar approaches have been tried in other viruses in the past, such as LCMV, the data presented here may be an advance for the HBV field to new approaches for eliminating the virus itself rather than only suppressing its replication.",

            "text": "The woodchuck is a valuable preclinical model for developing new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections. Even though several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatment with nucleoside analogues, DNA vaccines and protein vaccines were tested in chronically infected woodchucks, the effectiveness of those strategies was very limited. Strategies investigated so far were often hampered by weak T cell responses observed after immunization, suggesting a strong need for alternative strategies to enhance T cell functions during chronic HBV infection. Recently, our group published two independent proof-of-concept studies, showing that using a very potent T cell vaccine and blockade of negative signalling in T cells may lead to the resolution of chronic hepatitis B in some woodchucks (Table 3) . These data are encouraging and implicate the feasibility and usefulness of the immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronically HBV-infected patients. Nevertheless, which factors influence the effect of therapeutic vaccination remains to be further investigated. It has been noticed that satisfactory therapeutic effects could not be documented in the studies using HBsAgbased prophylactic vaccines. In the mean time, evidence has supported that HBcAg-specific immunity is endowed with antiviral and liver-protecting capacities in CHB patients and animal models. With the increasing number of available vaccine formulation, a more crucial question raised recently: what is the optimal combination of these vaccines. Obviously, it is necessary to test the mutual influences of different types of vaccines to maximize their effects and avoid the negative interference between the vaccines. Also, the question how HBV infection leads to defective immune responses to HBV proteins remains to be investigated. This issue is the key to a more rational design of new therapeutic approaches. Figure 2 summarizes the ideas of a potential combination treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis B.",

            "text": "The presence of viral components may be a main reason for T cell tolerance in chronic HBV infection. Antiviral treatment with nucleoside analogues efficiently reduce HBV replication and release of new virions and may partly restore HBV-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses, thereby allowing successful therapeutic vaccination. However, HBV proteins are still produced as the transcription of mRNAs for the S protein and the core protein on HBV cccDNA is not affected by antiviral treatment. Even when HBV DNA disappears during antiviral treatment, HBsAg and HBcAg/HBeAg are present in the liver or in blood at high levels. It is proposed to reduce HBV protein load by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which lead to the sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA. Using this RNA interference (RNAi) with chemically synthesized or vector-expressed siRNAs, many clinically relevant viruses including the human immunodeficiency virus, HBV and HCV could be inhibited. In in vitro experiments showed that WHV transcripts could be degraded by siRNAs [106] . At the same time, the degradation of viral RNAs resulted in the activation of multiple pathways of host innate immune responses [107] . However, future in vivo studies are required to demonstrate the usefulness of this technology. Combining gene-silencing approach with nucleoside analogues may further facilitate the stimulation of the immune system by therapeutic vaccines.",

            "text": "The epigenetic regulation provides an alternative to interfere with HBV gene expression. HBV minichromosome in hepatocytes is under the complex control of epigenetic mechanisms, and its transcriptional activity could be influenced by methylation, histone acetylation and other mechanisms [108] . Therefore, exploring epigenetic drugs to modify, these regulatory processes may achieve an effective suppression of HBV gene expression and thereby replace antiviral treatment with nucleoside analogues. The stimulation of innate immune responses may contribute to the control of HBV infection. In this special issue, Zhang and Lu provided a review dedicating to the role of TLR system. Interferons and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) represent still an important part for anti-HBV treatment. A recent review about this aspect described the current progress (Pei et al., in press) . Recently, the antiviral functions of ISGs are under studies. For example, interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 and 2 is a cellular factor that was shown to limit hepatitis B virus replication in hepatoma cells [109] . Another recent report by Lucifora et al. [70] about the role of APOBECs in the degradation of cccDNA was highly interesting, but remained to be controversial [110, 111] . Future investigation is required to elucidate the functions of ISGs and their relative contribution for control of HBV infection, before exploring these genes for antiviral treatment. ",
