The pathogenic agent is the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that represents a new strain of coronavirus. To date, there is no effective treatment currently involving supportive therapy while the presumed anti-viral immune response develops. This appears to consist of neutralizing Ab, as well as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that can be detected after SARS infection. We have previously shown that a nona-peptide corresponding to a sequence of the S2 protein from SARS-CoV could induce interferon-g-pro-ducing lymphocytes using an ELISPOT assay [3] . DimerX HLA-A2:Ig fusion protein/peptide complex staining and evaluation via flow cytometry have shown CTL for specific viral epitopes [4, 5] . In this study, we present evidence for the presence ofanti-SARS-CoV-specific CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from SARS-recovered donors using a SARS S2 protein nona-peptide derived DimerX HLA-A2:Ig fusion protein.",

The cells were incubated with 10 Ag/ml of either nona-peptide in 5% CO 2 at 378C. After 18h stimulation, the cells were thoroughly mixed and transferred onto flat-bottomed 96-well nitrocellulose plates (HA Multiscreen, Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) coated with anti-IFN-g mAb (2 Ag/ml, 1-D1K; diluted in pH 9.6 carbonate buffer). The cells were then incubated for an additional 20 h. The plates were washed and blocked with 10% human AB serum for 2 h at 378C. The IFN-g-secreted spots were detected using a commercial kit (MABTECH, Sweden) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The colored spots identifying the cytokine-producing cells were counted using a dissecting microscope. The mean number of spots from the triplicate wells was calculated and expressed as the number of specific IFN-g-secreting cells/1 \u00c2 10 5 cultured PBMC cells [8] .",

Briefly, nona-peptide concentration was calculated as noted below by the formula and dissolved at 20 mg/ml using DMSO (SIGMA, US) and then further diluted in sterile PBS to 2 mg/ml until use, was incubated BD DimerX reagent, and was then exposed to 5 volume equivalents of citrate-phosphate buffer (pH5.8) at 378C for 1.5-2 h. The pH of the mixture then was adjusted to 7.4 and the mixture was incubated at 48C for 36 h to allow the protein to refold. PBMCs from SARS patients or controls were blocked with human AB serum for 1 h before staining. The cells were suspended in PBS at a concentration of approximately 1 million cells per 50 Al and incubated with 4 Ag loaded BD DimerX at 48C for 1 h. After washing once with 200 Al PBS, the cells were resuspended in 100 Al PBS containing 1 Ag FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG (BD Biosciences, US) and incubated at 48C for 45 min. After washing twice with 200 Al PBS, the cells were resuspended in 100 Al PBS containing 1 Ag PerCPconjugated antihuman CD8 at 48C for 45 min.

S1203 is a nona-peptide with Leu and Val at positions 2 and 9 that anchor in the HLA-A 2 peptide binding groove and show a similar high affinity to HLA-A2 molecules during T2 cell binding assay [4] . In PBMC from SARS-recovered donors, specific CD8 + CTLs for S1203 were identified by DimerX staining as well as with ELISPOT assay using this nona-peptide (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, the results of DimerX staining paralleled the results of ELISPOT and both identify a class I MHC-restricted CD8+ T cell response (Table 1 ). In this study, PBMC from HLA-A2 \u00c0 SARS-recovered donors and healthy HLA-A2 + donors were also assayed and none of these controls responded in either assay system (Table 1) . This suggests that DimerX HLA-A2:Ig is a useful tool in the screening of CTL directed against specific epitopes from the SARS-CoV proteins.",

            "text": "DimerX staining as well as Tetramer staining [4, 10] provides a direct method using flow cytometry to identify the specific CD8 + CTL. Tetramer technology is technically difficult to produce and is useful for only one specific peptide. In contrast, DimerX can present a variety of antigenic peptides, which in this case were combined with HLA-A2. Thus, the DimerX-peptide complex technique can be easily adopted in a clinic immunology lab. The time course of anti-viral-specific CTL identified with these techniques can be relatively short following recovery from viral infection. This minimizes the utility of a complex technology such as a Tetramer because it requires identifying and preparing the appropriate antigen-specific epitope. In contrast, the DimerX:HLA-A2 fusion protein/ S1203 method for staining antigen-specific C*+ CTL appears to be a readily adaptable method to detect viralspecific cells during the post-viral recovery phase. This method could prove to be valuable in understanding the normal immune response to SARS-CoV as well as potentially helping to explain the varied outcome associated with SARS infection. PBMCs from SARS-recovered donors could be activated and secrete IFN-g by S1203, but not by H1121.
