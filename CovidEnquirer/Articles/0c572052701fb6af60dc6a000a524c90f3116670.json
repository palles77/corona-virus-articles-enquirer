Canaries have been domesticated since 1400, and are bred and kept for different reasons: their song (e.g. the Roller canary, the Harzer, Waterslager, Timbrado or the American Singer); as coloured canaries, including the melanin (black, brown, Gerry M. Dorrestein 8 agate, isabel) and lipochrome (red, yellow, white) groups; their build and shape like type canaries, including frilled canaries, e.g. North Dutch frill and Gibber Italico; type breeds, e.g. Japan Hoso, Yorkshire; shape breeds, e.g. Border Fancy and Norwich; crest and crest bred, e.g. Gloster; and feather pattern, e.g. Lizard, the oldest true breed canary (Coutteel 2003) ( Fig. 8.1) . The black-hooded red siskin (Spinus cucullatus) is the source of the red pigment that is added to the canary's genetic make-up, and is clearly in evidence in the red canary. The birds live approximately 6-16 years, are monomorphic and weigh 15-25 g. This longevity related to the small body size is typical for songbirds. Within the large songbird family Fringillidae (true finches), and especially the canary, mass-specific basal metabolic rates, longevity, longevity residuals and lifetime expenditure of energy are all positively correlated with the rate of cytochrome b evolution (Rottenberg 2007).",

            "text": "There are almost 1000 species of finches and other weaver relatives. They incorporate Old World granivorous and insectivorous birds, including weaver birds and estrildine finches; the ground-living wagtails, pipits, and accentors; the nectar-feeding sunbirds and flowerpeckers; sugarbirds and a few Australasian taxa; and the New World wood warblers, tanagers, and blackbirds, diagnosed by a strongly reduced tenth primary (Gill 1994) . The more domesticated species of finches and weavers have been bred in captivity for many decades, but many finches are still imported from Asia and Africa. There is a significant size disparity between the common finch pets (the smallest is the gold-breasted waxbill at 7 g, the largest is the Java rice sparrow at 20 g). Most common finches belong to the families Fringillidae and Estrildidae. Examples of commonly kept Fringillidae (true finches, approximately 150 species) are canaries (Serinus canaria), greenfinches (Carduelis chloris), goldfinches (C. carduelis), siskin (C. spinus), bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) and chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs) . Estrildidae (approximately 125 species) originating from Africa, Asia and Australia include waxbills, e.g. zebra finch (Poephila guttata) and Lady Gouldian or Gouldian finch (Chloebia gouldiae), nuns, e.g. spice finch (Lonchura punctulata), and parrot finches, e.g. the parrot finch (Erythrura psittacea). The finches are kept for breeding, but also as ornamental birds. Bengalese or society finches (Lonchura striata domestica) and zebra finches are used as foster parents for breeding Australian finches. This gives special problems, because they can be carriers of diseases that can kill the fosterfledglings -e.g. cochlosomosis and Campylobacter spp. infections. Conversely, using foster parents may prevent some infectious diseases that are transmitted from infected parent to offspring. For example, colonies of Gouldian finches that are air sac mite-free have been established by using society finches, which are not susceptible to air sac mites, as foster parents (Macwhirter 1994) . One of the major disadvantages of fostered birds is that they imprint on the foster parents, and may therefore be less likely to breed with their own species. For species-specific imprinting to occur, a finch should be exposed to its own species from the fifteenth to the fortieth days of life.",

The birds are in the aviary all year, with a shed for shelter and a flight outside. Planted aviaries are popular for these passerines, because the vegetation provides observers with a more natural view of a bird's behaviour ( Fig. 8.7) . Planted aviaries can cause problems when trying to control microorganisms and medicate diseased birds (Macwhirter 1994) . These plantings, however, are often necessary to get breeding results. For feather care in mixed ornamental aviaries, the birds should have access to water and/or sand-baths. In breeding aviaries, the housing depends on the season. Today, canaries are mostly bred indoors, and during the breeding season the birds are generally maintained as couples in small box-type cages approximately 50 \ue033 40 \ue033 40 cm ( Fig. 8.8 ). Normally the fancier allows the birds to lay two to three clutches using artificial lighting (Fig. 8.9 ). The weanlings are housed in communal flights, with or without outside quarters. In the winter season (resting season), the males and females are housed as separate groups in pens. Singing canaries are housed individually in small sing-cages (21 \ue033 20 \ue033 15 cm) for more than 5 months to be trained and enter singing competitions. The breeding aviaries are relatively easy to clean.",

The birds will acclimatize to their new surroundings, and often a fresh stool will be produced for examination. Transport in their own cage is recommended whenever possible. 'Light out/perches out' catching techniques are almost mandatory, and strong lighting in combination with a magnification device will greatly facilitate any examination of the tiny birds. When handling the birds, keep the windows and doors closed! The physical examination and clinical procedures are limited in the smaller passerines, but are nevertheless very important. Most digital gram scales can provide an accurate weight if the finch is contained in a paper box or bag, but the container must be weighed or tared. The usual physical examination is performed as for any other bird; the clinician should listen for respiratory sounds, and take care not interfere with the movements of the sternum, which could kill the patient. Special attention should be paid to the state of moult, the pectoral muscle mass (chronic or acute problem), the abdomen (by blowing the feathers apart and looking for an enlarged liver and dilatation of the gastrointestinal tract) and the skin (searching for pox lesions and parasites).",

Starlings were treated for 16 weeks. in the groups treated with phlebotomy or with deferoxamine and a low-iron diet, nonhaem liver iron concentrations decreased to safe levels after 16 weeks of treatment at similar rates (190 ppm/week and 163 ppm/ week, respectively). The low-iron diet alone reduced stored liver iron levels at a slower rate (45 ppm/week). The addition of inositol and tannic acid to the low-iron diet had no impact on stored liver iron concentrations.

Polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon\u00ae) released after overheating Teflon\u00ae-coated cooking utensils may be fatal to Passeriformes, as it is for psittacines. At necropsy, the extremely haemorrhagic, oedematous lungs are characteristic. 4. Avocado, or at least certain varieties, may be toxic to some passerines. Post-mortem findings in intoxicated birds include hydropericardium and subcutaneous oedema in the pectoral area (Hargis 1989). 5. Green almonds have been considered as a cause of mortality in American goldfinches, presumably from cyanide released by hydrolysis of amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside. 6. Ethanol toxicity has been reported in free-ranging passerines (especially cedar wax-wings) following the ingestion of hawthorn apples or other fruits that have frozen and then thawed, allowing yeast fermentation of sugars to produce ethanol. Birds are lethargic, ataxic, or may be in a stupor ('drunk'). Many intoxicated birds die from accidents that occur while they are 'flying under the influence'. The diagnosis is based on analysing crop contents and liver for ethanol concentrations (Fitzgerald et al 1990) . 7. Heavy metal toxicosis caused by the direct consumption of the metal is uncommon in passerines, because they have limited capacity to damage metal objects. Lead or zinc toxicosis has occasionally occurred when galvanized wire has been used in the construction or repair of enclosures. Another source of zinc for passerine species is galvanized containers for supplying bath or drinking water. Removing the source of heavy metals and the administration of chelation therapy (Ca-EDTA 20-40 mg/kg i.v./i.m., followed by 40-80 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d. until the lead has disappeared) are recommended. 8.

Between 2000 and 2004 a disease occurred in an aviary in Germany affecting various bird species belonging to the order Passeriformes including collared grosbeaks (Mycerobas affinis), Eurasian bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula griseiventris), brown bullfinches (Pyrrhula nipalensis), grey-headed bullfinches (Pyrrhula erythaca) and yellow-bellied tits (Periparus venustulus). The major clinical signs included increased mortality of fledglings and young birds, as well as feather disorders and feather loss in adult birds. In addition, adult Eurasian bullfinches showed in one year a disease course in which the major sign was inflammation of the skin beginning on the base of the beak and spreading over the head that occurred a few days before death.",

In another report multiple cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed in the intestinal smooth muscle cells of an adult canary from an aviary with a history of high mortality (50%) both in adult and young birds. Grossly, a mild enteritis was the only lesion appreciable. Smears of the proventricular contents contained a few gastric yeasts (Macrorhabdus ornithogaster). The intestinal inclusions were found in very high numbers in all parts of the tract examined. Inclusions of the same type were occasionally detectable in the wall of a few splenic and pancreatic arteries. No inclusions or lesions were seen in the other organs examined. Transmission electron microscopy of the intestinal wall revealed circovirus-like particles either in paracrystalline arrays or loose arrangements, mostly within the cytoplasm of the intestinal muscle cells.

An avian influenza A virus of the subtype H7N1 was isolated in summer 1972 from a single free-living siskin (Carduelis spinus Linnaeus, 1758). Additional cases of morbidity or mortality were not observed in the area were the sick siskin was found. The virus induced following experimental inoculation of chicken embryos a high rate mortality (mean death time approximately 24 hours). This virus was considered as a highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus. Canaries that were housed in the same room with the siskin were accidentally exposed by contact to the sick siskin, which resulted in virus transmission followed by conjunctivitis, apathy, anorexia and a high rate mortality (Kaleta & H\u00f6nicke 2005) . The role of passerines in the spread of avian influenza A is, however, negligible. A total of 543 migrating passerines were captured during their stopover on the island of Heligoland (North Sea) in spring and autumn 2001. They were sampled for the detection of avian influenza A viruses (AIV) subtypes H5 and H7, and for avian paramyxoviruses serotype 1 (APMV-1). For virus detection, samples were taken from (a) short-distance migrants such as chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs, n \ue035 131) and song thrushes (Turdus philomelos, n \ue035 169), and (b) long-distance migrants such as garden warbler (Sylvia borin, n \ue035 142) and common redstarts (Phoenicurus phoenicurus, n \ue035 101). Virus detection was done on conjunctival, choanal cleft and cloacal swabs. In none of the tested samples was AIV detected. Six out of 543 birds (1.1%) were found to carry non-pathogenic and lentogenic strains of APMV-1. This indicates that the passerine species examined in this study may play only a minor role as potential vectors of APMV-1 (Schnebel et al 2005) . In another study 413 free-living migrating passerines from 37 different species were caught in the autumn of 2004 in Slovenia and cloacal swabs taken and processed by RT-PCR and virus isolation. Only one sample from a common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) by RT-PCR was positive for AIV, but negative for H5 and H7 (Ra\u0109nik et al 2007) .",

The Enterobacteriaceae present a secondary problem in finches more frequently than in canaries. The clinical signs and gross necropsy are not specific and include depression, conjunctivitis and rhinitis, and may be fatal in some birds. These are secondary pathogens, however, and should be considered as a sign of poor health or management conditions. Possible causes are an unbalanced diet, housing problems or husbandry problems. Other primary diseases may be present (e.g. atoxoplasmosis or coccidiosis). Cultures are necessary for diagnosis, and a sensitivity test is essential for treatment.

Ever since Mycoplasma gallisepticum emerged among house finches in North America, it has been suggested that bird aggregations at feeders are an important cause of the epidemic of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis because diseased birds could deposit droplets of pathogen onto the feeders and thereby promote indirect transmission by fomites. House finches infected via this route, however, developed only mild disease and recovered much more rapidly than birds infected from the same source birds but directly into the conjunctiva. While it is certainly probable that house finch aggregations at artificial feeders enhance pathogen transmission, to some degree transmission of Mycoplasma gallisepticum by fomites may serve to immunize birds against developing more severe infections. Sometimes such birds develop Mycoplasma gallisepticum antibodies, providing indication of an immune response, although no direct evidence of protection (Dhondt et al 2007) .

Clinical diagnosis involves culturing from tracheal swabs, radiographic examination and endoscopy. In some cases (e.g. syringeal aspergillomata or localized air sac involvement), surgery may be effective in treating the disease. In chronic cases, drug therapy has a poor prognosis.

Until recently it was not possible to culture the organism. In canaries, infection caused by these organisms in the proventriculus is common, and is predominantly found on the mucosal surface and in the ducts of the glands. Macrorhabdus colonization of the proventriculus in companion birds is not always associated with clinical signs or pathological lesions (De Herdt et al 1997) . In one study, 22.9% of Psittaciformes (35.8% in budgerigars) and 19% of Passeriformes (only 16.7% in canaries) demonstrated a positive proventriculus at necropsy for these organisms (Ravelhofer et al 1998) . In a more recent study in Belgium there was an increasing incidence of Macrorhabdus in canaries (Marlier et al 2006) . At the time of death, macrorhabdiosis was diagnosed in 28% of canaries and 22.5% of budgerigars, but was not diagnosed in parrots. The incidence (or detection?) of macrorhabdiosis has significantly increased in recent years.",

The clinical signs include huddling and ruffling of the feathers, debilitation, diarrhoea, neurological signs (20%) and death. Mortality can be as high as 80%. An enlarged liver may be observed as a blue spot on the right side of the abdomen caudal to the sternum, referred to by fanciers as 'thick liver disease' (Fig. 8.34 ). At necropsy, an enlarged and sometimes spotted liver (with necrosis in the acute phase) is noted, along with a huge, dark-red coloured spleen (see Fig. 8 .4) and, often, an oedematous duodenum with vascularization. In the imprints of the liver, spleen and lungs, parasites are found in the cytoplasm of the monocytes. The nucleus of the host cell is crescent-shaped (see Fig. 8 .17). Coccidia are seldom found in the faeces or intestinal contents because, after the acute phase is passed, only a few coccidia (100-200/24 hours) are excreted. The therapeutic agent of choice is sulphachlorpyrazine (150 mg/L drinking water) until after moulting for 5 days a week.

In canaries this phase is often not diagnosed, and the owner is only alarmed when several birds become blind many weeks after becoming infected. In a flock many birds were affected with blindness, which developed over a 3-month span, and two birds developed torticollis. The route of infection is not known, but it is likely that oocysts excreted in cat faeces get into the aviary. In the acute phase, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, and mostly a severe catarrhal pneumonia and a myositis of the pectoral muscle, are found in canaries and mynahs at necropsy. The trophozoites are easily identified in impression smears. Microscopic alterations within the eye consisted of a non-suppurative chorioretinitis with large numbers of macrophages that contained the tachyzoite form of Toxoplasma gondii in the subretinal space, and aggregates of tachyzoites were found in the nerve fibre layer of the retina with and without necrosis. Tissue cysts with bradyzoites were scattered throughout the meninges and neuropil of the cerebrum and cerebellum (Williams et al 2001) . In histological slides from the brains, (pseudo)cysts are relatively easy to find. Serology, immunofluorescence on brain tissue slides, or infection of mice confirms the diagnosis. The Sabin-Feldman dye test will not detect T. gondii antibodies in the serum of birds (Patton 1996) . No effective treatment is known, although some effect is claimed using trimethoprim 0.08 g/mL H 2 O and sulfadiazine 0.04 g/mL in water for 2 weeks.

The most commonly encountered blood parasites include Haemoproteus spp., Leucocytozoon spp., Trypanosoma spp., Plasmodium spp. (malaria) and microfilaria. Plasmodium spp., the cause of avian malaria, are mosquito-borne protozoa that occur worldwide. Sporogony occurs in the invertebrate host, schizogony occurs in the erythrocytes, and golden or black refractile pigment granules are formed from the host cell haemoglobin. Plasmodium spp. have been described in free-ranging passerines, including tits, finches, thrushes, starlings and sparrows. They are occasionally found in captive-bred birds such as canaries and other finches. The diagnosis is based on the demonstration of the parasite in erythrocytes, and is differentiated from Haemoproteus spp. by the demonstration of the schizont in malaria. Clinical and post-mortem signs include anaemia and splenomegaly. Molecular techniques (PCR) have also been developed and results of avian population surveys conducted with PCR assays suggest that prevalences of malarial infection are higher than previously documented, and that studies based on microscopic examination of blood smears may substantially underestimate the extent of parasitism by these apicomplexans. Nonetheless, because the published primers miss small numbers of infections detected by other methods, including inspection of smears, no assay now available for avian malaria is universally reliable (Fallon et al 2003) .",

We assessed the statistical effects of biogeographic, plumage-related and life-history traits on the prevalence of the blood parasites (e.g. Plasmodium spp., Haemoproteus spp., Leucocytozoon spp. and Trypanosoma spp.) in european passerine birds. most of the variation in parasite prevalence occurred at low taxonomic levels. brighter male plumage and greater host body mass were associated with higher prevalence, explaining 32% of the total variation. male plumage brightness remained a significant factor when we controlled for phylogenetic effects. These relationships were driven primarily by simuliidtransmitted parasites (e.g. Leucocytozoon spp., Trypanosoma spp.), which were more frequent in species with northern distributions. host species with greater maximum longevity and shorter nestling periods had higher prevalences of Plasmodium spp.; however, the effect was not stable after controlling for phylogeny using pairwise contrasts. coevolution between hosts and parasites appears to create temporal and spatial variation that disconnects haematozoan prevalence from evolutionarily conservative life-history traits while creating some positive associations with traits that are phylogenetically labile. clearly, ecologists should be cautious in relating patterns of variation in haematozoan prevalence to particular host traits (Scheuerlein & Ricklefs 2004) .",

The worms are easily identified in the trachea at necropsy. Ivermectin (injection 200 \ue06dg/kg) and levamisole or fenbendazole are effective in treating this parasite, but caution should be exercised when treating birds with heavy infections, because the dead worms can obstruct the trachea.

Insects (e.g. cockroaches, crickets) serve as intermediate hosts. Geopetitia aspiculata are pathogenic, leading to perforation of the wall of the proventriculus, often resulting in death. The parasite is not hostspecific and is demonstrated in six avian orders, including Passeriformes (e.g. Emberizidae, Estrildidae, Fringillidae, Icteridae, Sturnidae -including a hill mynah). The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the embryonated spiruroid eggs in the faeces (although this might not always be effective), followed by endoscopic demonstration of the proventricular lesions. At necropsy an enlarged abdomen is found, due to a mass of tightly coiled parasites attached to the serosa of the proventriculus, and worms are sometimes found in the liver. Infected birds can be successfully treated with ivermectin (300-400 \ue06dg/kg body weight s.c.) or fenbendazole (25 mg/kg body weight p.o. for 3 days).

This was the first time that USUv had emerged outside africa and caused fatalities in warm-blooded hosts. although retrospective examination of blackbird tissues suggested introduction of USUv into austria already 1 year earlier (in 2000), there were no reports of bird die-offs that year (Weissenb\u00f6ck et al 2002). in the following years there was an increase in the number of diagnosed cases with a maximum of 91 cases in 2003. in 2005 only 4 cases were diagnosed in austria. The major macroscopic finding was hepatosplenomegaly; histologically, neuronal necrosis, myocardial lesions and coagulative necrosis of the liver and spleen were observed.
