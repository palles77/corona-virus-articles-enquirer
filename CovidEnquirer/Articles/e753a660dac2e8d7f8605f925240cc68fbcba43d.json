As time goes by, that impact is expected to become even more pronounced. ''The consensus seems to be that new information technologies will significantly affect almost every aspect of health care,'' wrote Blumenthal [1] . In this article, we examine the progress of e-health in the five leading economies of East Asia: Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Each seeks to place itself at the forefront of the information revolution and has high levels of Internet access and usage. Each also has a sophisticated healthcare system dedicated to securing maximum healthcare benefit at minimal cost. By standard outcome indicators, these systems all have very good records. The tigers, therefore, form a cluster in which e-health might be expected to be notably advanced. However, our finding is that although some progress is being made, it remains limited. It is also variable across the five societies.",

The fifth theme looks inside the healthcare sector and inside the surgery, at the implications of the Internet for physician-patient relations.

However, it is said that in US healthcare, most policy actors in both Congress and the executive branch continue to focus on pre-information age agendas. Although, the Bush administration has started to address these concerns, the result remains something of a lack of Internet-related policy activity and only a limited number of perspectives on the Internet's potential to transform the US healthcare system. Clearly structural features of the US system, including fragmentation both of government and of the healthcare sector, play key roles.",

Fried et al. detail some of the obstacles placed in the way of e-health by existing regulations, holding that individuals and organizations must navigate a maze of rules and codes, old and new, if they wish to implement fresh ideas and approaches [5] . Kassirer's prediction is that the courts will play a role when substandard medical advice provided through web sites or e-mail yields poor medical outcomes. He believes that courts will be especially important when professional advice is given without a direct patient encounter, or when state lines are crossed [6] . Some regulatory issues are US-specific, but many have much wider relevance.",

Kleinke argues that the Internet will not contribute to a solution to the administrative redundancies, economic inefficiencies, and quality problems that have long plagued the US healthcare system. Instead, it will exacerbate the cost and utilization problems of a system in which patients demand more, physicians are legally and economically motivated to supply more, and public and private purchasers are expected to pay the bills [7] . Goldsmith holds that the challenges of standardizing coding and formats for clinical information, and protecting patient privacy, will hinder the realization of network computing potentials in healthcare [4] . The problems to which these and other authors point are structural. Economic, organizational, legal, regulatory, and cultural conflicts rooted in the US healthcare system are all barriers to e-healthcare provision.",

Shortliffe criticizes Congress for focusing on short-term benefits, arguing that research investment for e-health must be balanced between basic and applied analyses [8] . Robinson examines the effect of distinct forms of capital on the development of the healthcare Internet. In the late 1990s, venture capital flooded into the ehealth sector, rising dramatically from US$3 million in early 1998 to US$335 million in late 2000. In the same period, 26 e-health firms went public, raising US$1.35 billion at their initial public offerings. However, the technology-sector crash in late 2000 hit the e-health sector especially hard, prompting an extended period of consolidation between e-health and more conventional firms [9] . US funding problems thus relate to both the public and the private sectors.",

            "text": "Finally, analysts have looked inside the surgery at physician-patient relations. Existing survey data show that citizens make considerable use of the Internet for healthcare information and services, mostly of a generic kind [10] . Indeed, Anderson reports that in 2002, 80% of US adults with Internet access did so [11] . As more patients go online, increasing numbers will turn up in surgeries with Internet-fueled questions and concerns. Meeting the growing expectations of these individuals will be a significant challenge for physicians [12] . Assessing the likely impact, Kassirer argues that the Internet will change the physician-patient relationship in unpredictable ways, with some aspects of electronic communication strengthening the bond, and others undermining it [6] . Goldsmith believes patients have most to gain from the emergence of the Internet, arguing that it will rebalance the steeply asymmetrical medical knowledge held by patients and physicians [4] . Using information gained through Internet searches, patients can now open their dialogues with physicians at a much higher level than before, and thereby gain leverage in the care process. Ball and Lillis also discuss the potential challenges the Internet presents to physicians. As Internet searches often generate as many questions as answers, physicians are likely to find themselves under increased workload pressures [13] . The variable quality of healthcare information accessed through online searches [14] , a matter that is being actively addressed by bodies such as the Health on the Net Foundation (www.hon.ch) and the Internet Healthcare Coalition [15] , can only reinforce those pressures. Zupko and Toth hold that physicians sometimes encounter a form of cultural shock when confronted by well-informed patients [16] . It is therefore perhaps not surprising that an April 2002 survey found that physicians are much more reluctant than patients to use the Internet for healthcare interactions. While 90% of patients wanted to exchange e-mail with their doctors, only about 15% of doctors actually did so. Physician-patient confidentiality, time concerns and increased exposure to malpractice liability were cited as primary reasons for doctors' wariness [17] . In the face of this mounting speculation and evidence, Lumpkin is sanguine, however, contending that the physician-patient encounter is little changed, despite widespread Internet usage in healthcare [18] .",

The four smaller societies, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, are particularly advanced. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis that hit the region in spring 2003 gave a major boost both to Internet usage in general, and to e-health in particular [19] . In Hong Kong, for instance, the number of active Internet users increased by 13% from February to April 2003, before falling back by 3% from April to June 2003. The overall increase was 10%. Also at the start of 2003, the time spent online by Hong Kong people first increased by 49% and then fell back by 18%, registering an overall increase of 22% [20] .

In Japan, in the 1980s, the fabled Ministry of International Trade and Industry targeted supercomputers and the Fifth Generation as a major development project [21] . Despite a long period of economic stagnation in the 1990s, the Japanese IT industry remains a significant global force. In Singapore in the 1980s, the state took the lead in nurturing wafer fabrication, the most sophisticated ''front end'' of the semiconductor industry. Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing, established by the government in 1988, is now the third largest silicon foundry in the world. In South Korea, in the early 1980s, the state reorganized the public-sector telecommunications system by closing inefficient firms and allocating profitable segments to major chaebol like Samsung and Goldstar, enabling them to establish specialized chip businesses. By the early 1990s, Samsung had become the world's number one producer of dynamic random access memories for PCs and workstations. In Taiwan since the 1970s, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the state-controlled Electronics Research Service Organization have played crucial roles in developing the semiconductor industry. Today, it is the fourth largest in the world, and firms within it have entered into strategic alliances with leading industry players in the West [22] . Even in Hong Kong, where a developmental state took longer to emerge, the government is currently overseeing the construction of a flagship Cyberport, intended to host a strategic cluster of companies and professional talents, specializing in IT applications, information services and multimedia content creation, and designed to project a hi-tech international digital city image.",

All three states featured in the top category of high e-government capacity. The survey did not assess Hong Kong and Taiwan, neither of which is a UN member state. The report noted that Singapore ''demonstrated a balanced and citizen-centric e-government program, while possessing the benefits of a high technological infrastructure and human capital measures''. It held that South Korea ''made perhaps the most dramatic advances in its e-government program by successfully implementing several new online transaction features''. It was more critical of Japan, arguing that it had ''yet to live up to its rather significant potential''. ''Japan's e-government program has not yet reached a comparable level of sophistication as that of the regional leaders due primarily to achieving only a limited interactive presence among national government websites'' [23] . A January 2002 analysis of e-government in East and Southeast Asia reached similar conclusions, identifying the five tigers as regional leaders [24] .

Throughout, government activity was funded out of general government revenue. The major and to date, only step change came in 1991, with the formation of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HKHA). This imposed state control and state funding on the secondary sector and gave Hong Kong a miniature version of the British National Health Service. However, there has never been any attempt to bring primary care within the planned healthcare system.

This body subsequently sought to drive private-sector disciplines into state provision through ''corporatization''. In 2000, in an attempt to generate integrated pathways of care, it was broken into two territorial clusters focused on the secondary sector but also having primary and tertiary elements. However, as most of the primary sector remained outside the state sector, the extent of integration was limited; in Singapore, the state provides 80% of secondary care but only 20% of primary care. On the funding side, Singapore in 1984 created a compulsory savings system, Medisave, within the wider Central Provident Fund scheme. It added the insurance schemes MediShield and MediShield Plus in 1990 and 1994 and created a basic social safety net, Medifund, in 1993. These various schemes partially fund secondary care provision. There is also some direct state subsidy. Funding of primary care takes place mainly through out-of-pocket expenses. The traditional sector stands outside all state planning and, as in Hong Kong, has only recently been brought within the regulatory framework.",

Throughout the region, the major quasi-autonomous state agencies, such as the national health insurance agencies in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, the HKHA in Hong Kong and the two big healthcare clusters in Singapore, also have sites. Here, we look only at the main government healthcare sites ( Table 2) . The overall quality is high. All have clickable links to organizational objectives and tasks. Most also offer detailed information about subsidiary divisions. All contain links to the government homepage and related healthcare sites so that visitors can conduct further searches and collect additional information. All provide feedback channels. In Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) offers online feedback opportunities. In Taiwan, citizens can make online appointments with the Director of the Department of Health (DoH). In Japan, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) uses e-mail to solicit However, within this generally strong showing, there are also significant differences, with Japan's MHLW and to a lesser extent, Hong Kong's HWFB lagging behind their regional counterparts in key respects. Firstly, the MHLW fails to provide contact details for named officials on its website. This is standard practice in the other four tigers. Singapore's MOH, for example, gives address, telephone number and e-mail details for key officials. Secondly, while healthcare professionals and officials in Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan can communicate with each other through the Internet, their counterparts in Japan and Hong Kong cannot. Thirdly, the range of options available to users is more restricted in Japan and Hong Kong than in the other three tigers. In South Korea, for instance, IT has played a role in the surveillance system for communicable disease since 1999. Through electronic data interchange and regional database management systems, notifying and reporting systems have been computerized, and an electronic record of all notified and reported cases is kept. Using the Super-Highway Communication Network, physicians and public health centers can access the notifying and reporting system, DisWeb, anywhere and anytime through the Internet (http://dis.mohw.go.kr).

Such a charge is less easy to sustain in the East Asian tigers, though again experience is variable. Singapore and Taiwan are the regional leaders. Singapore's eCitizen portal addresses many aspects of citizen interaction with government, with healthcare being a prominent theme. The Internet is used to reinforce the public health messages that have been disseminated by the Singaporean government through other media for many years. Behind the scenes, e-mail links pervade the healthcare system and enhance the cohesiveness of policy networks. In a controlled city state, those networks are in any case very tight. In Taiwan, the DoH in 2002 launched an ambitious e-health project, with a timeline stretching to 2006. The Health Information Network that is central to this initiative has a backbone funded by central government and permits local users in both the public and private sectors to participate on a self-paying basis. Drawing on US experience, it seeks to promote electronic medical records, based on a smart card system, so that information can flow to all parts of the healthcare sector. A Healthcare Certification Authority, created in 2002, oversees promotion of this initiative. In the other three tigers, progress is less impressive. Japan launched an e-Japan strategy in January 2001, designed to make it ''the world's most advanced IT nation within 5 years'' [30] . The strategy had an explicit e-government strand. In September 2001, the MHLW followed up by issuing a ''grand design'' for promotion of IT in the healthcare sector. The aim was to computerize the entire sector by 2004 and to introduce an electronic medical record system covering 60% of clinics and 60% of hospitals with 400plus beds by 2006. Progress towards targets appears to be on track. However, Japanese performance in the e-health domain is poor by regional standards. Hong Kong is also quite slow to place healthcare online. The HWFB site contains standard bureaucratic information, such as current policy initiatives and recent speeches, plus public health information that has been developed particularly since the 2003 SARS crisis. Here, the major networking initiative is being taken by the dominant public-sector delivery agency, the HKHA. While its primary focus is provision, the networking links being created among hospitals are likely to have policy consequences. As in Singapore, e-mail links also bolster ties within policy networks that are already quite cohesive. South Korea is making an aggressive attempt to exploit the Internet across all areas of government, but in the healthcare sphere, currently remains an average performer.",

One instance is limitations placed on consultations, which in all five tigers quite properly mandate face-toface physician-patient contact before any specific healthcare information or advice can be given. For the foreseeable future, online consultation, though technically feasible, is likely to be restricted by professional concerns. Another instance is limitations placed on information sharing and exchange, which in all the tigers are again very properly re- stricted by privacy considerations. However, there is some variation in regional regulatory practice. In Singapore, patients requiring repeat prescriptions can place an order online and have the medications delivered to their homes. Only after 6 months, do they have to return to the healthcare system to consult a physician. Elsewhere, this practice is illegal.

Their official health websites do not deliver any electronic service to individual patients. With the exception of initiatives taken by a small number of private hospitals in South Korea, like the Yonsei Eye and ENT Hospital, neither public nor private hospitals in these two tigers allow patients to register online. However, in 2001, Japan's MHLW established telemedicine networks to provide specialized care to people in remote areas. The government will provide US$4 million a year to form networks consisting of one large hospital and three clinics working together to supervise patients. Each patient will be equipped at home with a computer that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and other indicators, as well as a phone capable of transmitting video. They will be linked to physicians through an ISDN digital phone connection, thus enabling physicians to diagnose illness by electronically transmitted data. From June 2001, the MHLW started to establish 10 such networks a year, so that all 47 districts will have at least one by 2006 [32] . In 2000, South Korea's semipublic Seoul National University Hospital founded ezhospital, which is business-oriented instead of patient-oriented. With three main business elements, education (content services), e-trading and system integration, ezhospital is starting to alter purchasing arrangements for both medical and non-medical supplies. As the South Korean system is highly fragmented, the purchasing consortia that can be built through the Internet could one day become significant. At present, however, e-purchasing is at an early stage of development.",

In this domain, it is difficult to reach an overall assessment of the tigers' performance. On the one hand, their developmental state orientations make the general climate for IT industrial emergence very different from the climate found in the US. In this regard, the tigers look to the long term in a systematic fashion that has no US equivalent. On the other hand, it is hard to find evidence that the tigers are investing heavily in e-health applications. Moreover, because the private sector plays such a large regional role in healthcare, as it does in the US, many of the relevant initiatives fall outside the state sector and are hard to capture. There are undoubtedly many small commercial initiatives in East Asia as, again, there are in the US. Furthermore, like other commercial websites, private healthcare sites throughout the region rely heavily on advertising and sale of products for income. To take just two Taiwanese instances, the KingNet WebHospital and the Taiwan Physician's Net offer online sales not only of healthrelated products, but also of cinema tickets. The very fragmented nature of private-sector healthcare operations throughout the tigers means that few summary assessments can be made.",

However, there is a clear belief that patients have most to gain from e-health and physicians correspondingly have most to lose. In general, physicians in the tigers have tended to be wary of exploiting the Internet for patient interactions. This partly reflects the tight regulatory climate in which many find themselves, with many modes of physician-patient contact outlawed. It may also reflect a certain reluctance on the part of both physicians and patients to engage in the informalities of online contact. Until recently, then, the emergence of virtual physician-patient relations was highly limited. Since the spring 2003 SARS crisis, however, the pattern may have started to change. Although it is too early to register the longterm impact of the crisis, it is clear that during the SARS outbreak, many individuals sought to shift to online interactions with healthcare professionals. The fear of visiting surgeries and, in particular, hospitals that gripped the region in 2003 has certainly not disappeared and seems likely to provide a lasting stimulus to virtual delivery of healthcare. Furthermore, the generic healthcare information found in great abundance on English-language websites is paralleled on regional websites operating in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. There is also some official encouragement for patients to migrate to e-health. In May 2004, Hong-Jen Chang, CEO and President of Taiwan's Bureau of National Health Insurance, argued at an OECD forum that e-health could make a major contribution in informing patients. As evidence, he cited Taiwanese experience in confronting HIV/AIDS and the role of the Internet in educating patients about the disease.",

Overall, East Asian societies retain many traditional features, which generate some resistance to change in established modes of physician-patient contact. Nevertheless, there are also factors operating in the opposite direction. One long-term impact of the SARS crisis seems likely to be heightened caution about visiting healthcare facilities, for fear of contracting infectious disease, and a consequent boost for e-health.",

In Japan, the structural problems that mired the economy in stagnation for more than a decade from the early 1990s also form part of the explanation for its sluggish e-health performance. A notable feature of the Japanese healthcare system is the considerable power of the Japan Medical Association and its extensive links to the Liberal Democratic Party that has governed the country for almost all of the post-war period. In Hong Kong, the 1997 sovereignty transfer was quite disruptive, and only several years on is the political system taking a settled shape on the developmental state model.

In part, they resort to exhortation, calling on all members of society to engage in the project of securing and maintaining regional and/or global leadership in the information age.

This is far below the US figure of 13-14%, and also below the highincome country standard of almost 10%.
