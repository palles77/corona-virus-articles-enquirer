Flight crews would also contact AQIS and notify the staff of any passengers displaying symptoms that meant that the nurse and AQIS would have to board the plane and hold all passengers until the nurse reviewed the passenger. This was an enormous responsibility for many nursing staff, to review a passenger and give the all clear for a flight to disembark. After each patient was reviewed, a paper record of the assessment was generated. Both AQIS and the screening nurses completed their own unique set of forms that recorded the patient's details, examination, contact addresses and travel history. The nurse screening forms, once completed, were then faxed daily to the NSW DOH for review and collation for statistical purposes. Communication was vital for maintaining the service; the link to the latest and most up to date information was via the Internet and e-mail.AQIS provided the nurses with a computer with Internet access, and an e-mail address was created for the service. On a shift by shift basis, the nurses would download the latest information about SARS from various websites. Any pertinent journal articles were downloaded and printed out and the information shared between the nurses and AQIS staff. Regular teleconferencing and meetings with SESAHS and NSW DOH staff were attended as well. Data for statistical analysis were collected and sent to the NSW Chief Medical Officer on a daily basis via e-mail or fax.AQIS staff were equipped with radio devices for communication with AQIS managers while out roving in the terminals.
