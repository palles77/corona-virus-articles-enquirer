PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts, 32 with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed 33 short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the 34 horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus. Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs 35 in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 36 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, 37 Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 38 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two 39 PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered 40 phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three 41 inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 42 the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with 43 the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously 44 explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese 45 horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with 46 each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of 47 positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis 48 indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of 49 PyV than geographic distance.

In this 56 study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale 57 surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred 58 between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent 59 contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV 60 host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including 61 horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to 62 both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly 63 host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an 64 increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary 65 scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the 66 diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of 67 PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other 68 DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans.",

PyVs can induce neoplastic transformation 79 in cell culture [12], and are associated with malignancy in humans [13, 14] and raccoons [15]. 80 Currently, 98 species carried by various mammals, birds and fish are recognized within the 81 family Polyomaviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and 82 classified into four separate genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-and Deltapolyomavirus) with nine 83 floating species [16]. Recent identification of diverse PyV-like sequences in different fish species 84 [17] and invertebrates (including arachnids and insects) has revealed a deep co-evolutionary 85 history of PyVs with their metazoan hosts [17]. PyVs are highly host-specific in different 86 mammalian species, and long-range host jumps leading to productive infection and transmission 87 within mammalian genera are considered rare or nonexistent [17, 18]. Recently, an intra-host 88 divergence model with contributions from viral lineage duplication, recombination and, 89 potentially, host-switching at evolutionary timescales has been proposed to explain the extant 90 diversity based on the available genetic data [17]. .

These studies identified significant diversity 94 and high positive rates (10-20 %) using PCR-based approaches [27]. PyVs with complete or 95 partial genomes has also been identified by metagenomic analyses in bats collected in China and 96 recently from Saudi Arabia [28-30]. Investigation of PyVs in African insectivorous and 97 frugivorous bats [25, 26] has revealed evidence for short-range host-switching events of PyVs in 98 horseshoe bats (family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) following identification of nearly 99 identical viruses (99.9% at the genomic level) in Rh. blasii and Rh. simulator [26]. 100 In the present study, we have characterized the diversity and genetic relationships of novel 101 PyVs from a large number of insectivorous and frugivorous bat samples collected in diverse 102 ecological environments in China, resulting in the identification of inter-family host-switching 103 events in these bat-borne PyVs.

As shown inFig 5A,the tMRCA of bat hosts 316 were estimated based on the cytb sequences (~1800 bp) of bats that harbored the 28 novel PyVs.317The results showed that divergence among Rhinolophus species happened 14.2 to 17.3 million318 years ago (MYA) with a 95% highest posterior density (HPD), which is consistent with 319 previously reported divergence times (16-17 MYA) of the bat hosts based on mitochondrial 320 DNA [39] and other sampled bat families [40]. The Bayesian results for PyV divergence times 321 (Fig 5B) also showed that the tMRCAs for both Alpha-and Betapolyomavirus genera were 322 115-182 MYA with 95% HPD, overlapping with the divergence times of the tMRCA of placental 323 mammals (92 to 116 MYA) [41]. However, when compared with the Bayesian results for the bat 324 hosts, the time scale of PyV divergence was not always in agreement: specifically, 1) the 325 divergence time between Rhinolophus and Hipposideros hosts was estimated with a median 36.3 326 MYA in the 95% HPD range (34, 38) MYA, while the tMRCAs of Rhinolophus affinis 327 polyomavirus 5 and Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1 were estimated with a median of 0.02 328 MYA in the 95% HPD range (0.0012, 0.12) MYA; 2) The tMRCAs of Myotis horsefieldii 329 polyomavirus 3 and Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3 had a median of 1.05 MYA in the 95% 330 HPD range (0.4, 1.9) MYA, while the median tMRCA of both corresponding host species was 331 66.76 MYA in the 95% HPD range (60.9, 73.5) MYA; 3) The median tMRCA of Rhinolophus 332 affinis polyomavirus 2 and Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 was estimated as 11.61 MYA with a median of 37 MYA in the 95% HPD range (23, 54) MYA, was less than the predicted 337 divergence time between the hosts, with a median of 44.42 MYA in the 95% HPD range (40, 49) 338 MYA. In the four examples, the most parsimonious explanation for the lesser median ages to 339 divergence of the PyVs compared to the longer tMRCAs for the bat hosts is that these represent 340 examples of inter-family viral host-switching events. 341 342 Intra-lineage host duplication and host-switching events during bat PyV evolution. 343 The findings of the Mantel test and other studies [17] supporting intra-host divergence for PyVs, 344 required reconciliation with the compelling evidence of similar viral species infecting 345 evolutionarily distant bat species. Co-phylogenetic reconstruction analyses using JANE 4 were 346 therefore performed separately for both viral genera. The best-supported solution to explain the 347 divergence in the genus Alphapolyomavirus for the novel Chinese PyVs and African samples was 348 modeled with 11 co-speciations, 4 lineage duplications, 13 lineage losses and 9 host-switching 349 events (Fig 6A). Among the 9 inferred host-switching events, in agreement with the tMRCA 350 estimations, it was implied that Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 5 originated in the lineage 351 which gave rise to Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1, Rhinolophus sinicus polyomavirus 1 352 and 2, and Scotophilus kuhli polyomavirus 2 indicating that Rh-Hl PyV was originally a PyV 353 harbored by Rh. affinis, which was subsequently transmitted to H. larvatus.

In both solutions, 363 although the presence of duplication events could explain the existence of more than one 364 different viral species in the same host species, in multiple instances the dissimilarity between 365 viral species from the same host species was more easily explained by host-switching events 366 following the divergence between host species. 367 368 Positive selection in divergence of Chinese and African Rhinolophus PyVs are focused on 369 the external surface of the VP1. 370 Given the diversity of viral species identified in the genus Rhinolophus, viral proteins under 371 positive selection during the evolution of the different PyV lineages were of interest as possible 372 speciation determinants. We performed a Bayesian analysis to calculate the \u03c9 rate (dN/dS) to 373 identify genomic regions of the Alpha-and Betapolyomavirus genera in Rhinolophus PyV 374 clusters, which were likely subject to positive selection (S3 Fig).

Strikingly, the genomes of PyVs 395 characterized in respective bat species were 99.9% identical and contained only four virus 396 species-specific polymorphisms. Importantly, these polymorphisms were found to be present in397 both spleen and kidney samples of each bat host species, indicating a systemic and productive 398 infection. The genetic stability and restricted host-specificity of mammalian PyVs had previously 399 suggested a model of strict codivergence for PyV evolution [47]. However, this is inconsistent 400 with family-wide patterns of diversity, where an important contribution of intra-host lineage 401 duplication, recombination and, possibly, host-switching events is evident. A model of intra-host 402 divergence, with these additional evolutionary processes, occurring over the ancient timescales 403 for association of PyVs with multicellular life, has been proposed to explain the extant diversity 404 within the family Polyomaviridae [17]. The findings in the present study extend these 405 observations to PyVs in Chinese horseshoe bats and other bat hosts (see model in Fig 7) and 406 provide the first definitive evidence of inter-family host-switching of PyVs in mammals 407 occurring among the bat families Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae and Vespertilionidae. 408 The host-switching events of PyVs identified in the present study indicate that transmission of 409 PyVs between different bat species has been an ongoing process during the evolutionary history 410 of PyVs. HS1 and HS2 occurred between bats of different families and strains of PyVs sharing of PyVs (8 \uf0cd 10 \u22129 substitutions per site per year as previously estimated [48]), 414 the transmission events of Rh-Hl PyV and Rh-Mh PyV in bats happened recently, with a small 415 number of mutations accumulating in the viral genomes during viral adaptation to the permissive 416 hosts. Compared with HS1 and HS2, HS3 was estimated to have occurred much earlier, between 417 6.6-17.8 MYA, with the Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 showing 87% nt identity with 418 the closest PyV (Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2), indicating that the former had been 419 transmitted from Rhinolophus bats to A. stoliczkanus bats for a long period of time, had 420co-evolved with A. stoliczkanus and, finally, had formed a novel PyV species. In addition to 421 these observed host switching events, the tMRCA estimation and correlation analysis showed 422 strikingly that numerous PyVs had also been derived from host switching, thereby shaping the 423 evolutionary history of PyVs and providing evidence that inter-species transmission of PyVs, at 424 least in bats, is not as rare as previously thought.",

            "text": "An issue raised by the present study is how to define and name a PyV species when426    inter-family host-switching events of PyV are identified. The ICTV criteria for the formal 427 designation of PyV species in mammals must include the binomial name of the host species [36]; 428 nevertheless, the inter-family host-switching events of PyVs discovered in the present study as 429 well as the inter-species host-switching event also identified in Rhinolophus hosts in a previous 430 study[26]  which has challenged this nomenclature system for bat PyVs. Furthermore, numerous switching lineages have also been characterized here by correlation analyses and dating 432 estimation. All these findings suggest that host-switching of PyVs has occurred not only in433 different bat species but also at different time points in different geographical locations. The 434 ICTV nomenclature criteria should therefore be updated to include recognition of PyVs derived 435 from two different mammalian host species. 436 Inter-species transmission has already been observed in bird PyVs such as budgerigar 437 fledgling disease PyV (BFDV), which can infect multiple avian species with pronounced 438 pathogenicity [49]. Nevertheless, the ICTV nomenclature has utilized only the order level of the 439 host species in the naming scheme: for instance, species belonging to BFDV have been classified 440 as Aves polyomavirus 1. This naming scheme could also be expanded using the more descriptive 441 host species, as with the mammalian PyV species. So far, PyVs with host-switching events have 442 only involved two host species, illustrating the limited ability of PyVs for transmission between 443 different mammalian hosts. Therefore, the improved naming scheme of novel PyVs with 444 host-switching events proposed here would include the binomial names of both host species; e.g., 445 Rhinolophus affinis-Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus (Rh-Hl PyV), identified in the present 446 study, would become the prototype of a new species named Rhinolophus affinis-Hipposideros 447 larvatus polyomavirus 1.",

The correlation and genetic selection analysis 457 reported here has shown that the high sequence identity of different PyVs carried by different 458 host species was due to the co-divergence with strong negative selection of PyVs in respective 459 hosts, indicating that the \u2265 15% cut-off in LTAg gene identity for species demarcation is perhaps 460 no longer adequate and should be updated to \u226510%. With regard to the relationship between 461 Chinese and African bat PyVs referred to above, it is of interest to note that hepadnaviruses 462 (pararetroviruses with DNA genomes) identified in Chinese Rhinolophus bats in another study 463 [49] were also found to exhibit the closest genetic relation (79.6-79.7% nt identify) with viruses 464 carried by African Rhinolophus bats, [50] thereby suggesting that co-divergence of DNA viruses 465 within their Rhinolophus bat hosts is relatively common. 466 In the present study we have identified 28 novel PyVs from 15 bat species in 6 families [36], a 467 finding that has considerably increased our knowledge of both the genomic diversity and the 468 evolution of PyVs. Additionally, since there is a dearth of commercially available, standardized 469 bat cell lines for isolation and identification of bat-borne viruses there are now added options to 470 establish immortalized bat cell lines from many bat species by using LTAg genes cloned from 471 divergent PyVs identified in specific Chinese bat species. At present, the Tb1 Lu cell line derived free-tailed bat (Tardarida brasiliensis, family Molossidae) is currently the only bat cell 473 line available in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC Nr. CCL-88) [51]. Recently, 474 however, Banerjee et al. [52] have reported immortalization of primary bat kidney cell lines from 475 the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus, family Vespertilionidae) which were stably transformed by a 476 plasmid harboring a little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus, family Vespertilionidae) PyV LTAg. The 477 ability to establish cell lines from different tissues of diverse bat species and to make these 478 available to researchers is a prerequisite for replication studies, virus-host interactions and new 479 virus discoveries. 480 Papillomaviruses (PVs), which are closely related to PyVs and share similar properties such 481 as, high genetic stability and strict host specificity, have been shown to cause transient and 482 potentially cross-species infections. Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al. [53] reported that PVs do not follow strict 483 host restrictions in free-ranging Iberian bats (Eptesicus serotinus, family Vespertilionidae), as 484 they found evidence of host-switching events between two different bat species (E. serotinus and 485 E. isabellinus). They therefore recommended a revised paradigm of strict host specificity in PVs 486 [53]. 487 The findings presented here have possible implications for the study of zoonotic transmissions 488 involving highly virulent viral pathogens in bats. For example, horseshoe bats within the family 489 Rhinolophidae have been found to harbor genetically diverse severe acute respiratory syndrome 490 (SARS)-like corona viruses, which acted as major reservoirs for spillover of SARS coronavirus 491 to humans [7]. The Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has similarly been 492 associated with severe disease and lethal respiratory infections, mostly in Saudi Arabia. Likely",

We consider noteworthy that 500 in the present study we identified host-switching events of the normally highly host-restricted 501 PyVs within the bat families Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae. Whether this reflects a greater 502 propensity for host-switching in these bat families when compared with others and what 503 mechanisms are involved require further functional studies. Conceivably, given the high 504 prevalence we and others have detected of bat PyVs, co-infection of bat species within the 505 families Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae may affect the prevalence and/or transmission of 506 CoVs and other high virulent pathogens in bats.

In BK virus, 543 serological subtypes are assigned based on mutations present within the BC loop [63]. It has also 544 been previously demonstrated that sialylated glycans can act as primary receptors for PyVs [64] 545 and binding to sialic acid moieties was attributed to amino acids residues within the BC, DE and 546 HI loops, suggesting that these VP1 domains play a key role in virus attachment and cellular 547 entry events [45].

Of these 44 PyVs clusters, 42 showed exclusive host specificity 159 within a single bat species while, surprisingly, the remaining 2 clusters included viruses detected 160 in two bat species within different families (Rh. affinis and Hipposideros larvatus; Rh. affinis and Myotis horsfieldii, respectively). This finding provided preliminary evidence of inter-family 162 transmission of PyVs (Fig 2 and S1 Fig). The majority (n= 191) of these partial VP1 shared less 163 than 90% nt identity with the closest known PyVs. Interestingly, one VP1 sequence (marked by 164 cluster 10 in S1 Fig), named here as Pipistrellus pipistrellus polyomavirus XJPp02 (strain PyV10-YXAC25) shared 98% nt identity with Rattus norvegicus polyomavirus 1, previously 166 identified in brown rats in Germany [35].To further characterize the genetic diversity of the PyVs in these bats, inverse PCR based on 168 the partial VP1 sequences was employed to amplify the remaining genomes. A total of 42 full 169 genomes were obtained from 40 individual bats. As shown inTable 2, the genome sizes of the novel bat-borne PyV were 4,869-5,529 bp with 39.49-44.69% G+C content. All PyV genomes 171 displayed an archetypal genomic organization, including an early region encoding two 172 nonstructural proteins [large tumor antigen (LTAg), and short tumor antigen (STAg)], and a late region encoding three capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3) on opposite strands. Early and late regions were separated by a non-coding control region harboring regulatory elements. For all 175 samples from which PyVs genomes were obtained, a ~1,800 bp fragment of the cytb gene was amplified to corroborate the bat host species (Table 2 and S2 Fig).The PyV strains sharing \u2265 97% nt identity within the LTAg coding sequence were defined as 178 the same PyV, while those sharing \u2264 90% identities were defined as different PyV[36].Consequently, as shown inTable 2and Fig 3, the 42 PyV strains were identified as 28 novel 180 bat-borne PyVs based on genomic identities. Of these novel bat-borne PyVs, 26 were identified 181 in a single bat species, indicative of a high degree of host specificity. They included one PyV identified in a cryptic bat species (provisionally named Rhinolophus sp. CN2016) the permanent 183 identification of which awaits formal binomial classification of the host species as the cytb gene 184 showed only 90% nt identity with that of known bat species [37]. The PyVs named in the present 185 study were based on the binomial names of their host bat species and the chronological order of discovery, as per ICTV guidelines. For example, Aselliscus stoliczkanus polyomavirus 1 was the 187 first PyV discovered in Aselliscus stoliczkanus bats, and Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 2 was 188 the second PyV discovered in Rh. affinis bats. Interestingly, two remaining PyVs were identified 189 in more than one bat species. In detail, a PyV, herein provisionally named as Rhinolophus affinis-Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus (Ra-Hl PyV), was identified in both Rh. affinis and H. larvatus bats. Similarly, another PyV named as Rhinolophus affinis-Myotis horsfieldii polyomavirus (Ra-Mh PyV) was identified in Rh. affinis and My. horsfieldii bats. For clarity and according to the naming tradition of PyV, the Ra-Hl PyV identified in Rh. affinis was named Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 5 (the fifth PyV discovered in Rh. affinis), and the Ra-Hl PyV identified in H. larvatus was named Hipposideros larvatus polyomavirus 1. Similarly, the Ra-Mh PyV identified in Rh. affinis was named Rhinolophus affinis polyomavirus 3, and the Ra-Mh PyV identified in My. horsfieldii named Myotis horsfieldii polyomavirus 3.",
