            "text": "There are great variations among members of the family Coronaviridae in their ability to agglutinate red blood cells. Some strains such as A59 or JHM of mouse hepatitis virus are completely devoid of hemagglutinating activity. Other coronaviruses have been reported to be poor hemagglutinins, for instance transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Noda et al., 1987) or infectious bronchitis virus (Bingham et al., 1975) . Several members of this virus family, however, are quite potent hemagglutinating agents. These include bovine coronavirus (BCV), human coronavirus 0C43 (HCV-OC43), hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), and some murine coronaviruses (Kaye and Dowdle, 1969; Pensaert and Callebaut, 1974; Sato et al., 1977; Sugiyama and Amano, 1980) . Information about the nature of the erythrocyte receptors recognized by these viruses became available only recently, when BCV was reported to contain a sialate 9-0-acetylesterase (Vlasak et al., 1988a) . The same enzyme, which releases 9-0-acetyl residues from sialic acid, has previously been shown to be present on influenza C virions and to inactivate cellular receptors for influenza C virus (Herrler et al., 1985~; Herrler and Klenk, 1987) . These findings indicated that N-acetyl-9-0-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu59Ac,) is a receptor determinant for attachment of influenza C virus to cells, which was confirmed by resialylation studies (Rogers et al., 1986) . The esterases of both BCV and influenza C virus have been shown to inactivate the receptors on erythrocytes for BCV as well as for HCV-0C43 (Vlasak et al., 1988a) . This result indicates that Neu5,9Ac, is a receptor determinant for attachment of BCV and HCV-OC43 to erythrocytes.",

In addition to avian cells human erythrocytes were used, for which chemical analysis has failed to detect any 0-acetylated sialic acid (Shukla and Schauer, 1982) though red blood cells of some individuals may have low amounts of Neu5,9Ac, as indicated by hemagglutination tests with influenza C virus (Nishimura et al., 1988) . As shown in Table 1 , among the viruses tested only influenza A virus is able to agglutinate cells from all three sources. HEV was found to have the same agglutination behavior as BCV and influenza C virus. HA-titers of these viruses could only be determined with erythrocytes from adult chicken, while cells from one-day-old chicken and human erythrocytes were resistant to agglutination. Considering the type of sialic acid present on the red blood cells (see above), the result from Table 1 is compatible with Neu5,9Ac, being a receptor determinant for attachment of HEV to erythrocytes.",

The enzyme was isolated from purified influenza C virions (Herrler et al., 1988) . Following isolation, the HEF-protein of influenza C virus lacks hemagglutinating activity, but it retains the esterase activity. As shown in Table 2 , incubation with acetylesterase renders the red blood cells from adult chicken resistant against agglutination by HEV, BCV, and influenza C virus. However, receptors for HEV and BCV are more sensitive to the enzyme treatment than the receptors for influenza C virus. Incubation of erythrocytes in the presence of 2 mU of acetylesterase caused a 4-fold reduction of the hemagglutination titer of both HEV and BCV, whereas the titer of influenza C virus was unaffected. Increasing the amount of enzyme to 10 mU resulted in a partial reduction of the HA-titer of influenza C virus and in a complete resistance against agglutination by both coronaviruses. This result confirms the role of Neu5,9Ac, as a receptor determinant for attachment of HEV to cells. It indicates, however, that influenza C virus differs from both coronaviruses in the ability to recognize Neu5,9Ac,-containing receptors.",

Considering the difference in the carbohydrate structure between the two inhibitors, we conclude that strain JHB/1/66 of influenza virus has an increased affinity for Neu5,9Ac, compared to HEV and BCV and that the neighboring sugars are not of major importance for this interaction. So far different strains of influenza C virus have not been compared with respect to their affinity for Neu5,9Ac,. A mutant of strain JHB/1/66, however, was isolated which is more efficient in recognizing Neu5,9Ac,-containing receptors than the wild type (Szepanski et al., 1989) . This mutant has a broader cell tropism compared to the parent virus.
