This is particularly true at facilities where there is frequent turnover or movement of animals or where animals recently imported from natural habitats are introduced into colonies of highly susceptible colony-born animals. This chapter discusses those viral diseases of importance to captive primates or to the health of personnel involved in their care by taxonomic family to which the causative agent is classified. The rationale for this is that there is considerable overlap in the clinical and pathologic expression of diseases caused by viruses in the same taxonomic family regardless of the species affected. Obvious exceptions exist, but these will be noted.",

The likelihood of such transmission is increased when changes in the environment, either natural or imposed by humans, place different species in close proximity. An early example of this phenomenon comes from the family Herpesviridae in which infection of the natural reservoir host usually results in minimal clinical disease, whereas infection of other closely related species may result in an acutely lethal cytolytic or neoplastic process.",

Although isolation of primate species is the norm in wellmanaged modern facilities, such may not be the case with recently imported animals. Substandard separation of species, coupled with the stress of capture and movement, puts these animals at increased risk. Similarly, transmission of viral agents from nonprimate host to primate host may result in severe disease. Examples include transmission of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus from rodents to callitrichids and the transmission of various orthopoxviruses such as monkeypox or cowpox from rodent vectors to nonhuman primates. Increasingly zoological collections have adapted multiple species exhibits and more naturalist settings. While such exhibits have many benefits, it should be remembered that they may promote inadvertent crossspecies transmission of infectious agents.",

Virions have large genomes encoding approximately 200 polypeptides, at least one of which has homology with epidermal growth factor. This latter peptide acts to stimulate mitosis in neighboring cells and likely accounts for the proliferative epidermal and/or dermal lesions that characterize most poxvirus infections.

Viremia develops 3e4 days following experimental infection, at which time the virus disseminates to multiple sites, including skin, lung, mucous membranes, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract (Zaucha et al., 2001) . Lesions within the skin initially appear as papules consisting of proliferative acanthocytes and progress to vesicles. Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions are apparent within acanthocytes. Vesiculation is followed by umbilication to form the classic pock lesion. Progressive dermal changes take place over a 4-to 14-day period. Lesions within the lung are similar, consisting of irregular foci of hemorrhagic necrosis. These may be responsible for more serious clinical sequelae and transmission of the virus by the aerosolized route. Paralleling epidemiologic observations in humans, experimental infections in cynomolgus macaques have demonstrated that isolates from the Congo Basin clade are associated with increased lesion severity, elevated levels of virus, and greater mortality relative to isolates from the West African clade (Chen et al., 2005; Saijo et al., 2009) .",

To satisfy requirements for drug and vaccine licensure, nonhuman primate models of variola infection have been described. In a study by Jahrling et al., intravenous administration of high-dose virus to cynomolgus macaques resulted in an acutely lethal infection resembling hemorrhagic smallpox in man . Symptoms included fever, anorexia, cough, and viral exanthema followed by development of a severe hemorrhagic diathesis, multisystem organ failure, and death within 6 days of inoculation. Clinicopathologic findings included leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, increased D-dimers, and elevated serum creatinine. Dermal lesions were characterized by erythema and hemorrhage with progression to typical vesiculopustlar lesions. Virus was disseminated systemically via a monocytic cell-associated viremia to lymphoid, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and renal tissues. Additional findings included significant cytokine elaboration and depletion of T-cell dependent regions of lymphoid tissue.",

Clinical disease was characterized by the appearance of erythematous papules progressing through vesiculation and umbilication over a 4-to 6-week course (Gough et al., 1982) . Lesions were concentrated on the face, scrotum, and palmar or plantar surfaces. Identification of the etiologic agent was based on ultrastructural examination. A more recent report describes development of hemorrhagic dermal lesions with an identical distribution in a colony of marmosets and Saguinus species (Matz-Rensing et al., 2006) . Viral etiology was determined using molecular techniques to be a poxvirus with close homology to cowpox. Skin lesions from both reports were characterized by acanthosis with epidermal necrosis, ulceration, and typical pox-like intracytoplasmic inclusions. Disease may be fatal in New World monkeys. Transmission occurs via contact with rodent vectors which have a geographic distribution over much of Europe, Asia, and Africa but are not present in North America.

Infection of non-macaque species, including the Patas monkey, black and white colobus (Colobus abyssinicus), DeBrazza's monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus), capuchin monkey (Cebus apella), and common marmoset, has reportedly produced fatal disease (Gay and Holden, 1933; Loomis et al., 1981; Wilson et al., 1990; Thompson et al., 2000) .

The viral envelope contains at least nine glycoproteins that are targets of the immune response and help to define cellular tropism. Glycoproteins B and D have 80% and 56% identity with the respective HHV1 glycoproteins, while glycoproteins G and C demonstrate significant sequence variation (Ohsawa et al., 2002a; Perelygina et al., 2002) . Genomic sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis have demonstrated that distinct genotypes of herpes B virus occur in different species of macaques including rhesus, cynomolgus, pig-tailed, lion-tailed, and Japanese macaques (Smith et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 2000; Ohsawa et al., 2002b) . The parallel arrangement of phylogenic trees for B virus isolates and mitochondrial DNA sequences from the respective macaque species indicates probable co-speciation. Viral replication occurs rapidly, with enveloped capsids present 8e10 h after infection. In cell culture, syncytial cells and Cowdry-type A intranuclear inclusions are readily apparent.",

The percentage of animals with active oral lesions is much less and in one large study of 14 400 macaques was found to be 2.3% (Keeble, 1960) . The virus is transmitted through sexual or biting behavior and by fomites. In overcrowded or unsanitary conditions, animals may become infected at an earlier age and the seropositive rate may be higher. Animals remain infected for life and may periodically shed the virus in oral and genital secretions.

Immunohistochemistry utilizing antibodies against HHV1 can be used to demonstrate viral antigen in equivocal lesions. Inflammatory cells may be found within vesicles, epidermis, and subjacent dermis. Endothelial cell necrosis with intranuclear viral inclusions may be seen. In disseminated disease, there is widespread, hemorrhagic necrosis within the liver, lung, brain, adrenal gland, and lymphoid organs (Espana, 1973; Simon et al., 1993; Anderson et al., 1994; Carlson et al., 1997) .

Centrifugal spread may contribute to the enlargement of lesions or generalization during primary infection. Factors contributing to recrudescence are poorly understood, but stress, fever, ultraviolet light, tissue or nerve damage, and immunosuppression have been identified clinically as contributing factors in the reactivation of HHV in humans and may play a similar role with B virus in macaques. It is generally thought that stress related to changing social dynamics, transportation, or relocation can result in reactivation of herpes B virus (Mitsunaga et al., 2007; Elmore and Eberle, 2008) . Detection of shedding, although uncommon, appears to be most strongly associated with the breeding season (Weigler et al., 1993; Huff et al., 2003) . Other studies have shown that viral shedding in seropositive macaques was not commonly associated with common laboratory procedures or occurrences such as quarantine, parturition, and chair restraint (Weir et al., 1993; Huff et al., 2003) . Reactivation of oral lesions has been described in macaques treated with immunosuppressive agents and with solid organ transplantation drug regimens (Chellman et al., 1992) . Interestingly, reactivation is not commonly recognized in macaques experimentally inoculated with SIV and dying with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Simon et al., 1993) (Figure 1 .2).",

Negative animals should be kept in single cage housing or in small groups and be periodically tested by a modified ELISA for at least one year. Animals that are repeatedly negative by these criteria can then be moved to larger groups. Once in these breeding groups, animals should be periodically tested for seroconversion. Repeated testing during the quarantine period is required because animals may be (1) chronically infected and immunologically unreactive or (2) in the early stages of disease prior to seroconversion. Serologic testing on an annual or semi-annual basis should be continued as a component of colony management as seropositive macaques have been detected as late as 7 years post establishment of a SPF program (Hilliard and Ward, 1999) . Because the positive predictive value of screening tests decreases concomitantly with the reduced prevalence of disease, false-positive test results are more likely during the maintenance phase and require pursuit of confirmatory testing. While antibody testing is useful for colony management, the value of a single test in an individual animal is limited. Breaks in the SPF barrier status may occur from introduction of new animals, contact with contaminated fomites, or reactivation of latent infection in seronegative animals. Ideally, SPF colonies should be self-sustaining and not require introduction of new animals. When animals are introduced, appropriate testing and quarantine are required. If non-SPF animals are housed in the same facility, precautions should be taken to prevent transmission of the virus via fomites.",

HVP2 is most closely related to SA8 and demonstrates an 85% homology to the SA8 genome.

Like B virus and SA8, the HVP2 genome lacks the g34.5 HHV neurovirulence gene (Tyler et al., 2005; Tyler and Severini, 2006) . Antigenic similarities to herpes B virus have allowed HVP2 to be used as a surrogate antigen for diagnosis of B virus seroconversion.

Secondary bacterial infections and fibrosis may contribute to vaginal or urethral obstruction (Singleton et al., 1995; Martino et al., 1998) .

Severe disease is possible in infant baboons. Experimental inoculation of infantile baboons (though described as an SA8 inoculation, the original inoculum was isolated from an infant baboon) produced a fibrinonecrotic pulmonary alveolitis that was accompanied by multifocal hepatic necrosis. Intranuclear inclusions were noted (Eichberg et al., 1976) .

Periodic reactivation and shedding of the virus in oral secretions represent the primary reservoir and source of infection. Antibodies to SaHV1 have been detected in asymptomatic spider monkeys (Ateles spp.), capuchin monkeys, and woolly monkeys (Lagothrix spp.), and these animals may represent additional natural reservoir hosts or, more likely, carry antigenically related simplexviruses (Hull et al., 1972; Mou et al., 1986) . Initial infection of tamarins, owl monkeys, and marmosets occurs through inadvertent exposure to carrier species. Once established, intraspecies transmission results in an epizootic with high mortality.

The epizootiology and origin of these early outbreaks is poorly understood. In several instances they occurred in recently imported animals. Serologic evidence suggests that the Medical Lake macaque virus originated in Malaysia. Transmission from an unidentified reservoir host to aberrant primate hosts may be one factor related to the establishment of epizootics. The natural host of SVV has not been identified. Because disease is less severe in Asian macaque species and neutralizing antibodies have been detected in asymptomatic stump-tailed macaques, it is possible that macaque species may play a role in transmitting the virus to more susceptible species. Reactivation from a latent carrier state also plays an important role in transmission of the virus Mahalingam et al., 1992) . Recent cases of SVV in animals undergoing total body irradiation or other forms of experimental immunosuppression are thought to be associated with recrudescence in clinically affected animals or their contacts (Kolappaswamy et al., 2007; Schoeb et al., 2008; Hukkanen et al., 2009) . Reactivation may also occur secondary to stress of shipment or movement within a facility. Once established within a colony, the virus may spread rapidly via the respiratory route. Transmission via direct contact with skin lesions is also possible.",

A transient viremia occurs by day 3 post-inoculation with cell-associated virus likely transported in B and T cells (White et al., 2002; Gray, 2004) . A vesicular dermatitis appears by day 10 post-inoculation and is often hemorrhagic in appearance. Lesions progress from papule to vesicle to crust and appear as successive crops such that lesions of all stages may be present. Cutaneous lesions are characterized histologically by the formation of multiple vesicles within the epidermis that contain cell debris, erythrocytes, and rarely syncytial cells. Hyperplasia of the basal cell layer is associated with these vesicles. Characteristic eosinophilic, Cowdry-type A, intranuclear inclusions may be found in cells adjacent to the vesicle. A necrotizing vasculitis often exists within the subjacent dermis with viral inclusions evident in endothelial and adjacent cells. Viral antigen is found widely disseminated by 8 days and may be localized in the liver, lungs, spleen, adrenal gland, kidney, lymph node, skin, and trigeminal ganglion. Within the liver, there is multifocal to coalescing hepatocellular necrosis. Cowdry-type A inclusions may be found within hepatocytes bordering foci of necrosis. Similar necrotizing lesions may be found in the lung and throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Hepatic and pulmonary lesions may be the most severe lesions in affected animals. Neuropathological changes are not associated with SVV infections. Latency is established within neural ganglia. Competing hypotheses suggest hematogenous versus transaxonal transport to ganglia Kennedy et al., 2004) . Investigation of genomic transcription during latency has gathered much interest and is thought to have some similarity to VZV (Ou et al., 2007; Messaoudi et al., 2009) .",

They are slowly cytolytic and tend to cause enlargement of the nucleus and cytoplasm (cytomegaly) of infected cells both in vivo and in vitro. During viral replication, enveloped virions accumulate in large cytoplasmic vacuoles instead of being readily released into intercellular spaces. This feature accounts for their relative cell-associated nature and explains the fact that cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can also be found in infected cells. Unlike many of the cytolytic herpesviruses, cytomegaloviruses also tend to be restricted in terms of their host range with each viral species thought to have coevolved with its host. Finally, latent infections tend to persist in glandular tissue, lymphoreticular cells, and kidneys rather than in neurons. The RhCMV genome is 221 kb in length and contains approximately 230 open reading frames (Hansen et al., 2003) . The virus encodes a variety of proteins important for immune evasion including peptides that prevent host MHC-1 expression and a viral homolog of IL-10 that may limit inflammatory responses (Spencer et al., 2002; Powers and Fruh, 2008) .",

In contrast to herpes B, virus may be shed for extended periods and can be detected in a large number of animals at any given time (Huff et al., 2003) . Macaques become infected within the first year of life (Vogel et al., 1994) . Prior immunity also does not prevent re-infection, and animals can be infected with multiple genetic variants.

This genus contains more than 50 distinct simian lymphocryptoviruses isolated from a host of Old World and New World primate species suggesting significant co-speciation (Ehlers et al., 2010) . Most of these viral species have not been formally recognized by the ICTVand are catalogued in a recent publication by Lacoste and colleagues (Lacoste et al., 2010) . Viruses recognized by the ICTV include those of chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas, baboons, macaques, African green monkeys, and marmosets (Table 1 .2) (Levy et al., 1971; Falk et al., 1976; Gerber et al., 1976;  (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) FIGURE 1.8 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) . Histologically CMV produces both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions accompanied by neutrophilic infiltrates (A and B). The virus may target multiple sites including the lung, gastrointestinal tract, vessels, lymphoid tissue, central nervous system and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Targeting of nerves in the PNS (D, lingual nerve) may be associated with necrosis of the overlying epithelium (C, tongue). Viral antigen may be demonstrated in infected cells with immunohistochemistry (E). Gerber et al., 1977; Rabin et al., 1980; Payton et al., 2004) . Human herpesvirus 4 (Epstein-Barr virus, EBV) is the type species in the genus. In humans, infection with EBV is usually asymptomatic but may cause infectious mononucleosis when primary infections occur after puberty. This illness is characterized by lymphadenopathy, fever, pharyngitis, and circulating atypical lymphocytes in adolescents and young adults. EBV has been associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, hemophagocytic syndrome, T cell lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma in immunocompetent persons and oral hairy leukoplakia, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders in immunocompromised patients.",

While the lytic genes are well conserved, the latent genes demonstrate a modest homology of 27e50% with the corresponding EBV genes. Despite this, the genes maintain remarkable similarity of function. Like EBV, two distinct lineages of RhLCV (RhLCV1 and RhLCV2) have been identified based on significant genomic heterogeneity of the EBNA genes (Cho et al., 1999) .

Maternal immunity disappears at approximately 4e6 months of age after which juvenile macaques seroconvert at 6e12 months of age. By 2 years of age virtually all animals harbor the virus (Fujimoto and Honjo, 1991) . The nearly 100% prevalence in macaque colonies reflects the 85e95% prevalence of EBV in humans. The virus infects B lymphocytes and persists for life, usually in a latent form. Critical to the regulation of the latent state is the expression of EBV-encoded RNAs (EBER-1, and -2, EBERs), EBV-encoded nuclear antigens (EBNA-1, -2, -3a, -3b, -3c, and -LP), and latent membrane proteins (LMP 1, .

In contrast, SIV-inoculated animals with simian AIDS fail to develop a RhLCVspecific humoral response and demonstrate greater RhLCV viral loads indicating the importance of the CD4\u00fe T cell response to control of acute viremia (Rivailler et al., 2004) .

The disease course and pathologic characteristics parallel those observed in HIV-infected persons in whom the development of NHL represents an AIDS-defining illness. SIV-infected rhesus macaques have an incidence of NHL ranging from 4e19% while SIVinfected cynomologus macaques have an incidence of up to 40% (Rezikyan et al., 1995; Habis et al., 1999; Matz-Rensing et al., 1999) . Lymphocryptovirus transcripts are frequently detected in tumor cells while SIV transcripts or proteins are not. These neoplasms usually develop in extranodal locations including the nasal cavity, periorbital tissues, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, myocardium, and central nervous system and are classified as centroblastic, immunoblastic, large cell, or Burkitt-like lymphomas (Baskin et al., 2001) . Tumors are comprised of clonal expansions of CD-20-positive B cells and express a full spectrum of latent gene products (Blaschke et al., 2001) . While NHL typically develops in conjunction with progression to AIDS/SAIDS, T cell depletion is not sufficient for pathogenesis (Rivailler et al., 2004) . The ability of lymphocryptoviruses to immortalize B cells may allow for increased risk of mutation and subsequent lymphomagenesis. Variable expression of the oncogenes p53, p21, cMyc, and bcl2 in neoplastic tissue has been described (Kahnt et al., 2002) . There is one report of a mycosis fungoides-like cutaneous T cell lymphoma consisting of CD3e/CD8\u00fe lymphocyte and characteristic Pautier microabcesses in a pig-tailed macaque. The lymphocryptovirus isolated from tumor material was designated as Macaca nemistrina herpesvirus (MneLCV1) and appears to have a unique T cell tropism (Rivadeneira et al., 1999) .",

In 2000, an investigation of B cell lymphomas observed in common marmosets housed at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center led to the discovery of Callitrichine herpesvirus 3 (CalHV3) (Ramer et al., 2000) . Marmosets demonstrated weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, and palpable enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Histologically, the masses were comprised of sheets of CD20\u00fe neoplastic round cells effacing lymph node architecture and infiltrating the large and small intestine, liver, kidney, and lung. CalHV3 was detected in tumor material and circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells using molecular techniques. The virus was subsequently isolated (Cho et al., 2001) . Seroprevalence of CalHV3 in wild-caught and captive marmosets from various colonies ranges from 35e65% (Fogg et al., 2005) . Despite similar levels of seroprevalence, not all colonies observe a high frequency of B cell lymphomagenesis suggesting that additional factors are involved in the pathogenesis. Infection in the majority of marmosets is asymptomatic. The CalHV3 genome has been completely sequenced and demonstrates an overall homology with the EBV genome of 43% (Rivailler et al., 2002a) . The genome contains at least seven open reading frames with no homology to known viral or cellular genes (Rivailler et al., 2002a; Fogg et al., 2005) . These genes appear to be precursors to EBV latency genes due to their similar position within the genome and predicted protein structure. The CalHV3 genome is also missing 14 genes found in EBV and RhLCV. The absence of these genes may contribute to inefficient viral transmission and the lower seroprevalence of CalHV3 observed in marmoset colonies. These genetic differences suggest that CalHV3 may be more closely related to a primitive lymphocryptovirus from which it, EBV, and the other the Old World lymphocryptoviruses evolved (Rivailler et al., 2002a; Fogg et al., 2005; Lacoste et al., 2010) . Lymphocryptoviruses have since been detected in various New World primate species including the squirrel monkey, white-faced saki, whitefronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons), black spider monkey (Ateles paniscus), golden handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), and black-pencilled marmoset (C. pencillata) (Cho et al., 2001; de Thoisy et al., 2003b; Ehlers et al., 2003) .",

Rhadinoviruses are thought to be species specific and have been reported in rhesus and other macaque species as well as in African green monkeys, baboons, mandrills, drills, gibbons, chimpanzees, and gorillas (Greensill et al., 2000a (Greensill et al., , 2000b Lacoste et al., 2000a Lacoste et al., , 2000b Lacoste et al., , 2001 Whitby et al., 2003; Duprez et al., 2004; Bruce et al., 2005) . Rhadinoviruses are also well characterized in spider monkeys and squirrel monkeys. The ICTV-recognized Rhadinovirus species are presented in Table 1 .2, and additional identified species are cataloged elsewhere (Lacoste et al., 2010) . Members of this genus are classified into two distinct lineages; the Rhadinovirus-1 lineage containing KSHV and the primate Retroperitoneal Fibromatosis Herpesvirus (RFHV) and the Rhadinovirus-2 lineage which includes rhesus Rhadinovirus (RRV) (Desrosiers et al., 1997; Rose et al., 1997; Schultz et al., 2000) .

The RRV genome is 130 kb in length and encodes 84 open reading frames (Alexander et al., 2000; Searles et al., 1999) . The genome is collinear with the KSHV genome and most KSHV open reading frames have representative homologs in the RRV genome, and vice versa (Lacoste et al., 2010) . Rhadinoviruses, including RRV, encode several homologs of cellular cytokines including a viral IL-6 that has proinflammatory activity and may contribute to pathogenesis (Kaleeba et al., 1999) . The ORF73 gene encodes the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) which is essential for maintaining the viral DNA episome tethered to mitotic host cell chromosomes, allowing the virus to cosegregate with daughter cells during cell division (Wen et al., 2009 ). This protein is also thought to suppress lytic viral replication (DeWire and Damania, 2005) .",

Prior to the identification of RFHV, RF was most frequently associated with Simian Retrovirus 2 (SRV2). While the detection of RFHV sequences is most often observed in SRV2 co-infected macaques, there are limited reports of SRV-negative/SIV-positive RFHV-associated mesenchymoproliferative lesions (Bielefeldt-Ohmann et al., 2005; Bruce et al., 2006) . The RF lesion rarely infiltrates parenchymal organs but may produce small nodules or plaques disseminated across mesothelial surfaces. In severe cases, the entire gastrointestinal tract may be encased in a large fibrotic mass. Sclerotic and proliferative patterns of fibromatosis have been recognized and may coexist within the same animal. Histologically, the proliferative lesion is composed of spindle-shaped cells arranged in intersecting fascicles that infiltrate along serosal surfaces and surround normal structures. IHC using a cross-reactive anti-HHV8 LANA antibody demonstrates immunoreactivity within nuclei and large numbers of RFHV-infected cells in RF tissue Burnside et al., 2006) . A variable lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory reaction is usually present. The tissue is highly vascular and cells are embedded within a stromal network composed of collagen and reticulin. Absence of nuclear anaplasia and mitotic figures distinguish the lesion from fibrosarcoma. These cells are vimentin, desmin, and smooth muscle a-actin-positive and reveal variable positivity for the factor VIII-related antigen (Tsai et al., 1995) . An origin from vascular smooth muscle (pericyte) is favored. RF lesions have not been recognized in all large macaque colonies suggesting that RFHV is required but not sufficient for RF pathogenesis and that additional cofactors are required. Recognition of RF cases has declined in recent years and may be associated with elimination of SRV2 from SPF colonies ( Figure 1 .10).",

The genus Mastadenovirus contains the human and nonhuman primate isolates. The family name is derived from the fact that the original isolates were obtained from adenoids (diffuse lymphoid tissue of the nasopharynx) and tonsils of military recruits suffering from acute upper respiratory tract infection and conjunctivitis. Greater than 50 serotypes of adenoviruses have been isolated from nonhuman primate species, including macaques, African green monkeys, baboons, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys, and cotton-topped tamarins (Bullock, 1965; Kim et al., 1967; Eugster et al., 1969; Shroyer et al., 1979; Davis et al., 1992; Roy et al., 2009 ). Although adenoviruses have been confirmed as causing a mild to moderately severe respiratory or enteric disease of monkeys and apes, many isolates have been obtained from oral or anal swabs or from cell cultures derived from clinically healthy animals, suggesting that subclinical and possibly persistent infections of these species are common. A more severe disease has been described in animals whose immune systems are compromised either by immunosuppressive drugs or by concomitant infections, such as SIV and Betaretrovirus infections.",

At the vertices of the icosahedron there are 12 capsomeres that are pentagonal in cross-section (pentons) and have filamentous glycoprotein projections with knobbly ends that protrude from their surfaces. The remaining 240 capsomeres are hexagonal in cross-section and are referred to as hexons. The adenovirus genome consists of a single linear molecule of double-stranded DNA that ranges from 26e45 kbp in length. Human adenoviruses are classified into six established species, AeF, and a recently identified seventh species, G . While genetic data on nonhuman primate adenoviruses are forthcoming, current evidence suggests that ape viruses group with human species B and E while those isolated from Old World monkeys group with human species A and F (Kidd et al., 1995; Kovacs et al., 2004; Roy et al., 2004) . Included in the early region of the genome designated E1 are two genes, E1A and E1B, that encode proteins capable of transforming cells in vitro and causing neoplasms in hamsters and rats in vivo. These proteins have been shown to bind to and presumably inactivate the two well-known tumor suppressor genes, p53 and Rb, thereby causing malignant transformation. Despite the well-recognized ability of certain adenoviruses to experimentally transform cells in vitro and in vivo, these same agents have not been incriminated as the cause of naturally occurring neoplasia in any species.",

In general, adenoviruses tend to be rather species specific, but, in some cases, closely related species may be infected. Initial infections are generally transmitted through aerosols generated by sneezing and coughing or through pharyngeal secretions of infected individuals. The fecaleoral route is also a significant route of transmission due to the persistence of infection in tonsilar tissue and intestinal epithelium long after the clinical illness has subsided. Healthy apes and macaques shed large amounts of virus in the stool with virus detected in 36e90% of nonhuman primates maintained in captivity depending on the species and facility type (Roy et al., 2009) . Housing individuals under crowded conditions clearly promotes the spread of infection. Children and neonatal nonhuman primates are more susceptible to clinically apparent adenovirus infections than adults. The severity of infection varies widely depending on the serotype of the virus, the age and immune status of the patient, and the host species. As mentioned previously, many such infections remain clinically inapparent even though the patient is shedding large amounts of virus.",

In endosomes, the filament-bearing penton capsomeres are stripped from the particle, the pH within the endosome drops, and the endosome ruptures, spilling the partially degraded virion into the cytoplasm. These free particles bind to microtubules and are transported to the nuclear pores where the viral DNA is discharged into the nucleus, leaving the capsid in the cytoplasm. During the course of viral replication, cellular DNA and protein synthesis is severely disrupted, as is the normal processing of host messenger RNAs. These processes are incompatible with cell survival. Nuclei of cells containing actively replicating adenovirus develop large, amphophilic to basophilic inclusion bodies that either completely fill the nucleus or are surrounded by a prominent halo. Using electron microscopy, these inclusion bodies show prominent crystalline arrays of virions as well as unassembled viral capsid proteins and unencapsidated viral DNA.",

Recombinant vaccines based on human serotype 5 generate robust cellular and humoral immunity although prior natural infection, and presence of neutralizing antibodies may lead to reduced vaccine efficacy (Shiver et al., 2002; Santra et al., 2005) . Because of this limitation, there has been interest in the use of engineered simian strains as vectors (Roy et al., 2006; Tatsis et al., 2006) . Recent surveys for pre-existing immunity to simian strains have demonstrated presence of antibodies to chimpanzee adenoviruses within human populations from sub-Saharan Africa (Xiang et al., 2006; Dudareva et al., 2009) . While it is possible that human and chimpanzee antibodies may be cross-reactive, the presence of these antibodies suggests potential for cross-species transmission.",

Based on limited sequence data Cynomolgus polyomavirus (CPV) is a distinct genotype reported in normal and immunosuppressed cynomolgus macaques (van Gorder et al., 1999) . Considerable genetic heterogeneity has been observed in SV40 isolates from naturally infected animals (Lednicky et al., 1998) . Simian virus 40 was originally isolated from normal rhesus kidney cell cultures and subsequently from cell lines used for the production of killed poliovirus vaccine from 1954 to 1963. Because of its ability to readily transform cells in vitro and to produce malignant neoplasms in vivo, SV40 is one of the most extensively studied nonhuman primate viruses. Although its capacity to induce neoplasms in suckling hamsters is well established, its association with human disease is controversial.",

Its genome consists of doublestranded circular DNA approximately 5000 bp in length, encompassing early-and late-coding regions and a noncoding regulatory region. Two DNA-binding proteins coded within the early region are referred to as the large and small T (tumor) antigens and bind to viral regulatory sequences to facilitate the transcription of late viral genes. These genes have been studied extensively and are used in the construction of transgenic animals due to their transcriptional promoting activity. Evidence from macaques suggests that distinct subtypes of SV40 may exist that differ in their genomic sequence and ability to induce disease. Based on the genetic analysis of the SV40 regulatory region, a protoarchetypal strain of SV40 has been identified in neotropical Goeldi's monkeys (Callimico goeldii) suggesting that the host range of viral genotypes may be more extensive than previously recognized (Zdziarski et al., 2004) .",

The brain lesion consists of multifocal to confluent regions of demyelination scattered throughout the cerebral white matter and subependymal regions. Demyelination can be confirmed by Luxol fast blue staining and results from direct viral injury to oligodendroglial cells. Large basophilic inclusions fill and enlarge nuclei of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. As the lesion progresses, gitter cells and astrocytes predominate. These lesions resemble progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) of humans with JC virus reactivation. Immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization can be used to confirm SV40 infection. Renal lesions are found primarily within the inner cortex and medulla. Collecting tubules are lined by hypertrophic/hyperplastic and occasional dysplastic epithelial cells containing typical viral inclusions. These inclusions are often found in the desquamated epithelial cells present in tubular casts. Their large size and deep basophilic color often make them visible under the lowest magnification. These findings are accompanied by a chronic nonsuppurative tubulointerstitial nephritis, fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis, and atrophy. It is postulated that renal lesions may predominate in macaques acquiring infection during immunosuppression, whereas CNS lesions are more likely to occur following a recrudescence of latent infection (Horvath et al., 1992) . Disease phenotype may be dependent on viral genotype; for example CPV has been associated exclusively with interstitial nephritis. Pulmonary lesions are seen less frequently and consist of a proliferative interstitial pneumonia with intracellular viral inclusions present within hypertrophied type 2 pneumocytes.",

Serological surveys indicate that humans and a variety of nonhuman primates are immunoreactive for LPV or an antigenically related virus (Takemoto et al., 1982) . This virus induces tumors in hamsters but has not been associated with naturally occurring disease in primates. Recent evidence has demonstrated a zoonotic potential for LPV (Delbue et al., 2010) . LPV genomic sequences have been detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of both HIV-infected and -noninfected individuals.",

Their genome is approximately 8 kb in size and encodes ten open reading frames. Research has focused on transregulatory factors (El and E2) and early viral proteins (E6 and E7) and their role in host cell growth dysregulation. Most papillomaviruses identified in nonhuman primates are of the Alphapapillomavirus genus although recently a Betapapillomavirus was identified in cynomolgus macaques (Joh et al., 2009) .

            "text": "Specific strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) including HPV 16 and 18 are associated with an increased risk of cervical carcinoma. Viral DNA in these carcinomas and in viral-induced dysplastic lesions is present in an integrated form. If integration disrupts the E2 open reading frame, the normal control of early viral genes (E6/E7 products) is disrupted. These gene products can promote unregulated cell growth by two mechanisms: E7 protein binds to and deactivates the tumor suppressor protein (pRb) and E6 protein facilitates the degradation of another tumor-suppressing protein (p53). HPV types associated with cervical carcinoma apparently contain early viral proteins with high affinity for pRb and p53, whereas HPV types associated with low cancer risk are not. Other genetic and environmental factors likely act in conjunction with HPV infection to complete carcinogenesis. Papillomavirus DNA with similarities to HPV 16 was detected in a penile squamous cell carcinoma with lymph node metastasis in a rhesus macaque (Kloster et al., 1988; Ostrow et al., 1991) . Female macaques that had mated with this male or were exposed via intermediate sexual contacts demonstrated a 71% incidence of papillomavirus infection that was detected clinically, histologically, or via molecular methods (Ostrow et al., 1990) . Of the females surveyed, one presented with an adenosquamous carcinoma of the endocervix and another with a squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. These initial reports indicated that genital infection with this genus of viruses may be carcinogenic for nonhuman primates, as is the case in humans. Subsequent surveys by Wood and colleagues demonstrated up to a 19% overall prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in cynomolgus macaques (Wood et al., 2004 (Wood et al., , 2007 . Lesions were highly associated with presence of papillomavirus infection and included benign vaginal papillomas, mild to severe intraepithelial dysplasia, and occasional invasive cervical carcinomas. Key morphologic features included koilocytosis, nuclear atypia, anisokaryosis, expansion of the basal epithelium, and presence of epithelial pearls. Transfer of exfoliated cervicovaginal cells propagated infection and initiated lesion development in a subset of animals (Wood et al., 2007) .",

In regions of the world where rabies is endemic, populations of wild nonhuman primates may represent important vectors in the transmission of the virus to domestic species and humans. A report from the state of Cear\u00e1, Brazil attributed at least eight cases of human rabies deaths to transmission by rabid common marmosets (Favoretto et al., 2001) . Viral isolates did not correspond to previously identified variants of rabies virus and were suggested to represent a unique strain. The tendency in this region to capture and raise marmosets as pets as well as the close proximity of marmoset habitats to urban centers are factors thought to contribute to the emergence of this cycle.",

This suggests that while macaques involved in the Reston outbreak were obtained from the Philippines, they may have become infected by inadvertent contact with African species. Inappropriate husbandry procedures such as reuse of needles and failure to organize flow of work may have contributed to the spread of virus within the Philippine facility (Miranda et al., 2002) .

These mediators additionally may cause endothelial cell activation and breakdown of endothelial integrity contributing to hypovolemic shock. Disseminated intravascular coagulation results in microvascular thrombosis and secondary multi-organ failure. Tissue factor release from infected monocytes is thought to be a key mediator in the induction of DIC in Ebola virus infections (Geisbert et al., 2003) .

Loss of circulating CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T cells was not observed in this model and, while NK cell populations in the blood declined, an increase was observed in the spleen suggesting trafficking of this cellular population to tissues (Fritz et al., 2008) . Both viral infections are associated with a massive cytokine elaboration and abrogation of the host interferon response.",

Animal infections (swine and fowl) are believed to have played a critical role in the generation of influenza viral strains responsible for these pandemics.

Based on soluble (S) internal antigens, three virus types are recognized (A, B, and C). Types B and C infect only humans, have limited antigenic variation, and usually produce only sporadic cases. Type A strains infect a variety of animal species (humans, nonhuman primates, foals, fowl, swine, and seals), are more virulent, and have been responsible for the great pandemics. Two protein subunits within the viral envelope (hemagglutinin (H) antigen and neurominidase (N) antigen) define viral subtypes. The H antigen mediates adhesion of the virion to sialic acid residues on respiratory epithelial cells. The N antigen facilitates viral entrance to the cytosol following fusion and endosome formation. Infection with a particular strain produces strong immunity, preventing reinfection. Unfortunately, genetic reassortment between genes coding for H and N subunits occurs with striking regularity, producing new subtypes that pre-existing immunity does not protect against. It is the emergence of these new strains that are sufficiently different from previously circulating subtypes and for which pre-existing immunity is not protective that has been associated with widespread human infection. Infection of fowl and/or swine is believed to be critical in the production of many of these strains.",

Members of the genera Respirovirus and Rubulavirus contain a hemagglutininneuraminidase protein while members of the genus Morbillivirus lack neuraminidase. Members of the genus Pneumovirus, however, exhibit neither neuraminidase nor hemagglutinin activity. The surface spikes of all Paramyxoviridae members contain two glycosylated proteins that are responsible for the attachment and fusion of the virus to susceptible cells. The hemagglutinin or hemagglutinin-neuraminidase functions as an attachment protein in the case of the Paramyxovirinae subfamily. Within the Pneumovirinae subfamily, the attachment protein is termed protein G. Both subfamilies have a fusion protein (F) that is responsible for membrane fusion. The F protein contributes to fusion of infected cells with noninfected cells and formation of multinucleated syncytial cells.",

Here we will address the members of the Respirovirus and Rubulavirus genera. The term parainfluenza virus will be used broadly to refer to viruses within these genera. Parainfluenza viruses have a global distribution where they are highly contagious and responsible for upper and lower respiratory ailments of a wide variety of species. Serological surveys indicate that most species of monkeys and apes have been infected with one or more parainfluenza viruses either in their natural habitats, as in the case of newly imported animals, or after being maintained in laboratory colonies. Many of these infections are mild and may go clinically undetected. The principal mode of transmission is by aerosols, although direct contact with infected secretions can also be a mode of transmission. Parainfluenza viruses appear to be less species specific than adenoviruses, as cross-species transmission among nonhuman primates, human beings, rodents, and possibly even dogs and cattle seems likely based on the antigenic relatedness of homologous serotypes isolated from these species. Reinfections with the same or related viruses occur with some frequency.",

            "text": "Once in the respiratory tract, parainfluenza viruses bind to epithelial cells of the respiratory mucosa in the nasal cavity, nasopharynx, trachea, or bronchi and bronchioles. The virus enters susceptible cells by binding to and fusing with the cell membranes. Its negative-strand RNA is transcribed to form multiple molecules of messenger RNA that code for various viral proteins and as an entire transcript of positive-strand RNA that serves as the template for the synthesis of entire molecules of negative-strand viral progeny RNA. During the replicative process, infected cells develop both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic viral inclusion bodies corresponding to the naked, intranuclear, tubular nucleocapsid and the fuzzy coated cytoplasmic nucleocapsids, respectively. Infected cells, bearing viral-encoded fusion proteins, often fuse with adjacent noninfected cells to form multinucleated syncytial giant cells. Thus, the hallmark of infection by viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae is the presence of single or multinucleated syncytial cells bearing both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic inclusion bodies. Infected cells undergo virus-induced lysis and desquamate from the mucosa, thereby predisposing the host to secondary bacterial infection. Coinfecting bacterial species include Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumonia, and Pasteurella multocida (Sutherland et al., 1986; Kondgen et al., 2008; Szentiks et al., 2009 ). The disease produced by parainfluenza viruses varies from a mild upper respiratory infection (coryza) to a rhinotracheobronchitis or croup-like illness to frank pneumonia. Most animals recover from these infections unless secondary bacterial infection results in death. Most respirovirus and pneumovirus infections do not result in a viremia.",

Intranuclear inclusions composed of viral nucleocapsid are prominent and result from defective viral replication. One or more defects in the M, H, or F antigens prevent the formation of mature virons. Although an acute measles encephalitis in macaques and other species is well recognized (Baringer and Griffith, 1970) , it is less clear whether reported cases of SSPE in nonhuman primates critically fulfill all diagnostic requirements of SSPE in humans (Kim et al., 1970; Albrecht et al., 1972) .",

It can be propagated in vitro on primary macaque macrophage cultures and on the MA-104 embryonic African green monkey kidney cell line . Diagnostic ultrastructural changes become apparent after 24e72 h in these cells and include the formation of unique lamellar replicative structures. SHFV has been shown to naturally infect several African species, including Patas monkeys, African green monkeys, and baboons (Papio anubis and P. cynocephalus). Of these, the Patas monkey represents the most important reservoir and the greatest risk to macaques. In these species, infection is usually asymptomatic and reportedly animals may be viremic and seronegative (Gravell et al., 1980b) . Several strains of SHFV have been identified in Patas monkeys, which vary in their ability to cause clinical disease, persistent infection, and an antibody response (Gravell et al., 1986b) . Interestingly, Patas monkeys persistently infected and unable to mount an antibody response are able to clear infection when inoculated with a more virulent strain capable of inducing acute disease (Gravell et al., 1986a) .",

Necrosis of germinal centers in other lymphoid tissues is prominent. Complete cortical thymic necrosis with sparing of the medulla is reportedly unique to SHFV infection (Zack, 1993) . Lesions elsewhere are compatible with those associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and include deposition of fibrin thrombi within glomeruli, hepatic sinusoids, and lung. Lesions within the small intestine consist of extensive hemorrhage within the lamina propria accompanied by intestinal epithelial cell necrosis. As with other arteriviruses, fetal loss is common. A lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis is present in a minority of animals.

In humans, pathogenic flaviruses characteristically produce meningoencephalitis (e.g., Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile virus) or a hemorrhagic fever syndrome (e.g., yellow fever, dengue). Although many of these viruses are transmitted by arthropod vectors (ticks and mosquitoes), some may be transmitted directly among mammalian hosts. The Flavivirade family is comprised of three genera including Flavivirus, Hepacivirus, and Pestivirus. Members of the Flavivirus genus can be grouped serologically into distinct groups based on differences within the envelope protein, the most significant of which are the Dengue, Japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus subgroups. The number of identified flaviruses is continually expanding, and the pathogenicity of most for nonhuman primates is unknown.",

This has allowed species such as the rhesus macaque and owl monkey to be useful for evaluation of Dengue vaccination strategies and study of virologic and immunologic responses Blair et al., 2006; Raviprakash et al., 2008; Simmons et al., 2010) . However, the absence of significant clinical disease has limited the utility of such models for the study of the pathogenesis of Dengue hemorrhagic fever and Dengue shock syndrome. A recent publication suggests that high-dose intravenous inoculation with DNV2 was associated with a hemorrhagic phenotype accompanied by modest thrombocytopenia, increased D-dimer, and increased thrombineantithrombin complexes (Onlamoon et al., 2010) . The significance of dengue virus infection of wild nonhuman primates is unknown.",

HCV is a member of the tentative genus Hepacivirus. Like other members of the flaviridae, HCV is a single-stranded positive sense RNA virus. It was identified in 1989 through work largely made possible through transmission of infectious serum from human patients with non-A non-B hepatitis to chimpanzees (Choo et al., 1989) . Like many other RNA viruses, HCV has an error-prone replicase resulting in a high mutation rate that leads to the production of progeny virions exhibiting extensive sequence variation.

They are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a 9.5-kb genome encoding a single polyprotein that is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases. Structural proteins are encoded within the N-terminus of the polyprotein and the homologous nonstructural proteins encoded within the C-terminus. GBV-A and -C are unique among the flaviviridae in that they lack a well-defined capsid protein. As with all flaviridae translation of the viral proteins is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), a highly structured RNA sequence within the 5' NTR. The IRES binds to the host 40S ribosomal subunit and the eukaryotic initiation factor to precisely position the start codon at the ribosome decoding site. One of the critical elements of the IRES is the IIIc stem loop which is highly conserved not only among HCV genotypes but GBV-B and pestiviruses. Deletion of the IIIc loop results in a significant reduction of IRES-initiated translation and thus has been an attractive target for small molecule inhibitors. The structure and function of the IIIc stem loop have been compared between HCV and GBV-B and have revealed extensive homology suggesting that GBV-B may represent an appropriate model to study such inhibitors.",

The origin and importance of GBV-like agents to wild and captive marmosets is presently unclear. Samples from wild-caught primates in South America have found animals to be naturally infected with these agents and distinct sequence differences have been observed between isolates from captive colonies and those in wild animals.

Clinical symptoms include fever, anorexia, and an acute respiratory syndrome. On histopathologic examination an interstitial pneumonia and alveolitis may be identified as well as a multifocal, necrotizing hepatitis with minimal to moderate periportal, mononuclear infiltrates. Dendritic cells, macrophages, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells are the cellular targets of infection. Earlier and more robust humoral and cellular immune responses are associated with control of viral replication and survival in the cynomolgus model (Baize et al., 2009) . Severe, fatal disease associated with experimental Lassa virus infection in common marmosets has also been described (Carrion et al., 2007) . Animals developed fever and weight loss accompanied by high levels of viral replication. At necropsy, the characteristic multifocal hepatic necrosis was present in addition to evidence of hepatocyte proliferation as indicated by KI67 immunostaining. Animals demonstrated lymphoid depletion characterized by loss of T and B cells. Depleted regions were replaced with histiocytic infiltration. Such changes were likely associated with impairment of the adaptive immune response and progression of disease.",

At the time these epizootics were suspected to be the result of an underlying simian viral infection. The issue remained unresolved until the early 1980s when, spurred by a burgeoning epidemic of immunodeficiency in homosexual men, investigators simultaneously identified two agents capable of inducing immunosuppressive disease in macaques. The first virus, a member of the Betaretrovirus genus, was identified and designated simian retrovirus type D (SRV/D) (since designated simian retrovirus [SRV]) (Daniel et al., 1984; Gravell et al., 1984; Marx et al., 1984) . The second, a member of the Lentivirus genus, was designated simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques (SIVmac) Letvin et al., 1985) . This primate lentivirus is closely related to the etiologic agent of human AIDS and has subsequently been the subject of intensive investigation as an animal model of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Because SRV is more distantly related to the human immunodeficiency viruses than SIV, it has received far less attention than its lentivirus cousin. Although SIV may be of greater scientific interest as an animal model of human AIDS, SRV is clearly of greater significance in the management and care of captive macaques. As experience has shown, not only is SRV more difficult to eliminate from macaque colonies, it is also responsible for most cases of spontaneous viral-induced immunodeficiency in captive members of these species.",

Subsequent work indicated that this virus caused a wasting syndrome and thymic atrophy when inoculated into infant rhesus macaques and that approximately 25% of all macaques housed at US regional primate research centers were seroreactive to MPMVor a closely related virus (Fine et al., 1975; Fine and Arthur, 1981) . Several SRV serotypes have since been reported and include SRV type 1 (SRV-1), type 2 (SRV-2), type 4 (SRV-4), and type 5 (SRV-5). More recently SRV-Tsukuba (SRV-T) was isolated from macaques housed at the Tsukuba Primate Center in Japan while SRV-6 and SRV-7 were identified in free-ranging rhesus macaques and langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) from India (Nandi et al., 2000 (Nandi et al., , 2006 Hara et al., 2005) . These three novel viruses remain untyped by antibody Simian retrovirus type 2 (SRV-2) Macaca sp.",

            "text": "Epizootiology SRV appears to be transmitted readily among captive macaques. SRV-seropositive rates vary widely among colonies and likely relate to husbandry, housing practices, and efforts to eliminate the virus. Investigation of an epizootic of SRV in captive Celebes black macaques (Macaca nigra) revealed an increase in the seropositive status from 0% to greater than 90% during an 8-year period following the introduction of several infected animals to the colony (Lerche et al., 1986; Shiigi et al., 1989) . New World primates appear to be resistant to SRV infection in part due to species-specific variability in the TRIM5a protein that is a major factor in determining host range of retroviral infections (Diehl et al., 2008) . This protein facilitates premature dissociation of virus cores and subsequent proteasomal degradation. SRV-1 may be isolated from the saliva of healthy carrier animals, and biting with inoculation of saliva or blood is the most likely method of horizontal transmission (Lerche et al., 1986) . Wilkinson and colleagues determined that exposure to blood from viremic animals carried a higher risk of infection while blood from non-viremic animals with provirus integrated in circulating mononuclear cells was less likely to transmit infection (Wilkinson et al., 2003) . Vertical transmission may play an additional role in the propagation of the virus within macaque colonies. Cesarean-derived infants raised in isolation may be infected (Tsai et al., 1990) . Moreover, mother-to-infant transmission may occur in the perinatal or postnatal period. Of fundamental importance to the design and implementation of control strategies is the fact that animals may be persistently infected, healthy, and shedding virus while seronegative for antibodies against SRV. It is these seronegative virus-positive individuals that frustrate control strategies. Evidence suggests that in utero infection may be more likely to result in this seronegative, virus-positive status than transmission at other times (Moazed and Thouless, 1993) . These animals may play a key role in viral persistence within colonies.",

In asymptomatic animals there may be generalized lymphadenopathy characterized by varying proportions of follicular and paracortical lymphocytic hyperplasia consisting of immature CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T lymphocyte subsets. With the onset of severe immunosuppression, eventually the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes evidence Retroperitoneal and subcutaneous fibromatosis in association with RFHV; noma marked lymphoid depletion and complete effacement of normal architecture. In these nodes the paracortex is often depleted of lymphocytes and plasma cells, which are largely replaced by histiocytes and contain small postreactive follicles with hyalinized arterioles . Hyperplastic or hypoplastic bone marrow may be present and contributes to the frequently observed anemia and granulocytopenia. The hallmark of the acquired immunodeficiency in macaques induced by both SRV and SIVmac is the occurrence of unusual opportunistic infections. Despite some similarities, there are, for reasons that are presently unclear, differences in the propensity of these viruses to induce disease by specific opportunistic organisms. SRV-infected animals appear to be more susceptible to infection by pyogenic bacteria and less susceptible to infection by Mycobacterium avium, Pneumocystis carinii, SV40, and adenovirus. Moreover, SIV-specific lesions are lacking and the occurrence of overt lymphoma is uncommon in SRVinfected animals. A rapidly progressive necrotizing gingivitis and stomatitis known as noma (cancrum otis) is most often described in SRV-infected animals while other common opportunistic infections such as disseminated CMV, oral and esophageal candidiasis, intestinal cryptosporidiosis can be observed in either SRV or SIV-infected animals (Lowenstine, 1993) .",

Serological and molecular techniques were also used to demonstrate possible SRV exposure with a relatively high frequency in healthy individuals from Guinea (Morozov et al., 1996) . However, a survey of over 200 individuals occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates demonstrated a very low seroprevalence of 0.9% and virus was not able to be detected via viral isolation or molecular techniques (Lerche et al., 2001) .

Restriction patterns of initial STLV-1/HTLV-1 isolates suggested that a number of distinct but related viruses were contained within the STLV grouping.

The seventh clade G is populated by STLV-1 species isolated from Papio sp. (Koralnik et al., 1994) . It is postulated that this diversity is due to repeated cross-species transmission within restricted geographic localities.

This has perhaps been best characterized in baboons (Voevodin et al., 1985; McCarthy et al., 1990; Hubbard et al., 1993) . In this species, STLV-1 infection has been linked to the development of an ATLL-like syndrome characterized by non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. Involvement of the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, skin, and especially lung is common. Overt leukemia has been documented in greater than 50% of the cases and is occasionally associated with the presence of circulating multilobulated neoplastic lymphocytes, a clinical feature of ATLL (McCarthy et al., 1990) . Unlike human patients with ATLL, hypercalcemia is uncommon. Within the lung, the earliest changes may be present in a perivascular and/or peribronchiolar distribution. Although a variety of cell types have been recognized, most cases have been of T-cell lineage (CD2\u00fe CD4\u00fe). Interestingly, an ATLL-like disease consisting of cells expressing CD8\u00fe was identified in an African green monkey. Spontaneously transformed cell lines from STLV-1 infected African greens also consisted of CD8\u00fe cells suggesting that STLV-1 may preferentially transform CD8\u00fe cells in this species (Akari et al., 1998) . Histologically, infiltrates vary from a monomorphic population of neoplastic lymphocytes to a more pleomorphic population accompanied by multinucleated giant cells, necrosis, and inflammatory cells.",

The tax gene product stimulates transcription of viral mRNA by acting on the 5 0 long terminal repeat (LTR) and is highly conserved among all STLV/HTLV isolates, suggesting a fundamental role in viral replication and disease pathogenesis (Sakesena et al., 1994) . In addition to stimulating the 5 0 LTR, tax may activate host genes responsible for controlling T-cell proliferation, including c-fos, c-sis, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2r, and GM-CSF, thereby leading to polyclonal T-cell expansion. It is postulated that secondary events are required for monoclonal neoplastic transformation. Monoclonal integration of STLV-1 has been demonstrated in African green monkeys with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and preneoplastic lymphoproliferative disease . Such integration is considered definitive evidence of the etiologic role of PTLV in lymphomagenesis. Coinfection with other viral agents such as SIV or EpsteineBarr-like viruses may promote neoplastic transformation (Voevodin et al., 1985; Traina-Dorge et al., 1992) .",

The striking similarity between SIVinduced disease in macaques and HIV-induced disease in humans makes the SIV-infected macaque an extremely valuable model for the study of human HIV infection. Macaques infected with SIV develop many of the same clinical and pathologic abnormalities that occur in AIDS patients and die from the same array of opportunistic infections (OI). Using SIV-infected macaques as a model of human AIDS has produced a volume of research concerning all aspects of lentiviral biology and pathogenesis that cannot begin to be summarized here. The lessons to be reinforced from a standpoint of colony management and conservation are that (1) well-adapted viruses may be carried asymptomatically and silently by one primate species and yet have devastating consequences when introduced into another species and (2) the occurrence of unusual opportunistic infections should spur a vigorous search for an underlying immunosuppressive etiologic agent.",

Prevalence varies by species and geographical region although it can be quite high in some populations (Hayami et al., 1994) . Other than in rare instances, these viruses do not cause disease in their natural hosts and only manifest as an immunodeficiency syndrome when transferred to a different species. Over 40 different SIV isolates from various African species have been recognized. Viral strains are designated by a three-letter suffix to indicate the common name of the species from which they were originally isolated (e.g., SIVcpz from chimpanzees). When distinct viruses have been isolated from different host subspecies, the subspecies is designated with a second suffix (SIVcpzPtt from P. troglodytes troglodytes and SIVcpzPts from P. troglodytes schweinfurthii). The relatedness of SIV isolates correlates most closely with speciation of the host (Franchini and Reitz, 1994) . Phylogenetic analysis reveals that isolates from each nonhuman primate species form monophyletic lineages. While this suggests that there has been significant co-speciation of virus and host, there are also numerous instances of cross-species transmission and viral recombination. With the continued survey of African primates and discovery of novel SIVs, further genetic characterization of these isolates will only add to the complexity of the phylogenetic classification. Currently the monophyletic lineages can be grouped into seven major lineages or clades (Table 1 .9).",

Similarities in the viral genomes combined with opportunities for geographic comingling and exposure via hunting provides strong evidence that the emergence of HIV-1 resulted from at least three crossspecies transmission events between apes and man (Desrosiers, 1990; Gao et al., 1999; Hahn et al., 2000) . HIV-1 isolates are organized into three major groups, MeO. Viruses in group M have spread globally thereby causing the HIV-1 pandemic. Viruses from groups N and O have remained confined to patients living in Cameroon and surrounding regions. The origins of HIV-1 groupings M and N have been traced to troops of Pan troglodytes troglodytes residing in southeastern and south central Cameroon where the prevalence of infection in apes can range as high as 35% . A divergent SIVcpzPtt lineage is thought to have given rise to SIVgor which shares closest homology to HIV-1 group O. Evidence suggests two possibilities for a source of HIV-1 group O: independent transmission events resulting in transfer of virus from Pan troglodytes troglodyes to both gorillas and humans or, alternatively, western lowland gorillas serving as an intermediate host and transmitting virus directly to humans Takehisa et al., 2009) . As of yet there is no known human counterpart to the SIV harbored by P. troglodytes schweinfurthii. P. troglodytes versus and P. troglodytes vellerosus have not been found to harbor SIV. The origin of SIVcpz is thought to be the result of a recombination event involving viruses from two distinct lineages; an ancestor of SIVrcm of red-capped mangabeys and an ancestor of the arboreal guenon clade (Bailes et al., 2003) . Chimpanzees exposed to these primate species through hunting likely contracted both SIVrcm and SIVgsn ancestral viruses which led to recombination within the chimpanzee host and subsequent emergence of SIVcpz.",

Identification of the vpu gene in SIVs of the arboreal guenon lineage provides further evidence that one of these viruses contributed the 3' segment to the SIVcpz genome during an ancient recombination event (Courgnaud et al., 2002; Barlow et al., 2003) . The red-capped mangabey group currently contains one isolate found circulating in populations of the group's namesake (Beer et al., 2001) . The red-capped mangabey is closely related to sooty mangabeys, and viruses from both species contain a vpx gene. This would suggest that these viruses should cluster together. However, the pattern of clustering depends on the region of the SIVrcm genome examined. This genomic mosaicism indicates that the SIVrcm strain arose from multiple recombination events. The virus has thus been designated its own lineage. As mentioned previously, SIVcpz resulted from a recombination event between a SIVrcm-like virus and a guenon virus. SIVrcm uses the CCR2b co-receptor for viral entry rather than the more commonly used co-receptor CCR5.",

These isolates demonstrate a high degree of diversity and are the simian strains most closely related to HIV-2. As with SIVcpz and HIV-1, several cross-species transmission events between sooty mangabeys and man are thought to have contributed to the emergence of HIV-2 (Hirsch et al., 1989; Gao et al., 1992) . HIV-2 isolates are arranged in groups AeH with groups A and B representing epidemic strains. Sooty mangabeys from the Ivory Coast harbor SIVs related to HIV-2 groups A and B while those from Sierra Leone and Liberia harbor SIVs related to groups CeH (Santiago et al., 2005) . Like HIV-2, representatives from the sooty mangabey group have genomes containing a vpx gene. SIVsmm is ancestral to SIVmac from rhesus macaques, SIVmne from pig-tailed macaques, and SIVstm from stump-tailed macaques Benveniste et al., 1986; Murphey-Corb et al., 1986; Lowenstine et al., 1992; Apetrei et al., 2005) .

L'Hoest's monkeys have a 57% prevalence of SIV representing a significant reservoir (Beer et al., 2000) . Western red colobus (SIVwrcPbb; Piliocolobus badius badius and SIVwrcPbt; P. badius temminckii) and olive colobus (SIVolc; Procolobus verus) isolates align with the L'Hoest lineage when examining homology across the entire viral genome although certain regions of the genome such as the gag and 5' end of the pol sequences cluster with the Colobus lineage (Locatelli et al., 2008; Liegeois et al., 2009) .

The open reading frames include three genes encoding structural proteins (gag, pol, and env), two genes encoding regulatory proteins (tat, rev), and the genes encoding accessory proteins (vif, nef, vpr, vpu, vpx) . The compliment of accessory genes varies by the viral isolate. The function of the viral proteins and process of lentiviral replication have been extensively reviewed and will only be discussed briefly here (Freed, 2001; Voevodin and Marx, 2009 ). The three structural protein genes are each expressed as a polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into multiple functional proteins. The SIV gag gene encodes the p55 precursor protein that is cleaved into the capsid (p27 protein homologous to the HIV major core protein p24), matrix (p17), nucleocapsid (p8), and p6 proteins. These proteins not only make up the viral capsid but are also integral to viral assembly. The pol gene encodes the viral enzymes protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. The protease enzyme is involved in cleaving precursor peptides, the reverse transcriptase enzyme catalyzes the conversion of the RNA genome to a double-stranded DNA copy, and the integrase enzyme catalyzes the insertion of the viral DNA into the host cell chromosome. Each of these enzymes is a target for antiretroviral therapeutics. The env gene encodes two viral glycoproteins: the surface glycoprotein gp120 and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. The gp41 anchors gp120 and is involved in mediating fusion of the virus with host cell membranes during viral entry. The gp120 interacts with the CD4 molecule and a coreceptor to bind virus to the target cell and induces a conformational change in gp41 that promotes fusion of the virion envelope and the host cell plasma membrane. Most SIVs utilize the b-chemokine receptor CCR5 as the co-receptor for viral entry (Zhang et al., 2000) .",

There are two additional accessory proteins commonly present in complex retroviruses. The vif gene encodes the viral infectivity factor that aborts the antiviral action of the host APOBEC protein system. The nef gene encodes a 27-kDa protein termed \"negative factor.\" This protein has a variety of functions including downregulation of the CD3eT cell receptor (CD3eTCR) complex and MHC class I expression at the host cell surface thus impairing the ability of cytotoxic T cells to recognize infected cells.",

Retrospective analysis of tissues achieved from outbreaks of opportunistic infections and malignant lymphoma in captive macaques that occurred in the late 1960s and early 1970s demonstrated underlying SIV infection (Daniel et al., 1988; Lowenstine et al., 1992; Mansfield and Lackner, 1994; Mansfield et al., 1995) . The close homology between one of the isolates (SIVstm) and SIVsmm suggested the source was sooty mangabeys. The virus was propagated within the captive macaque populations and resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. In another instance, macaques were inadvertently infected when inoculated with sooty mangabey-derived tissue containing Mycobacterium leprae (Gormus et al., 1989) . Xenobiotic inoculation or transplantation of tissue carries the risk of introducing unsuspected or unknown agents into the recipient animal. Although such protocols clearly play an important role in biomedical research, and in this case led to the serendipitous establishment of the SIV model of HIV/AIDS, they should only be undertaken with realization of the potential risks involved. Recipient animals should be housed in an appropriate fashion to prevent the further transmission of such agents.",

The acute phase of infection in African species is similar in many respects to that observed in macaques. Peak virus production occurs within 1e3 weeks post-inoculation, innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated, and a partial control of viral replication enables achievement of the set point of viral replication. Virus replicates to high titer in both Asian and African species targeting the gut and lymphoid tissue and resulting in a depletion of CD4\u00fe T cells at mucosal sites (Gordon et al., 2007; Pandrea et al., 2007) . Asian species demonstrate peak viral loads of 10 7 e10 9 RNA copies/ml of plasma in line with or higher than those observed in normal rhesus macaque progression profiles (Broussard et al., 2001; Holzammer et al., 2001; Pandrea et al., 2006; Paiardini et al., 2009) . In both species, acute infection is accompanied by modest declines in CD4\u00fe T cell counts (Rey-Cuille et al., 1998) . Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of African primates appear to be comparable if not slightly diminished when compared to macaques (Zahn et al., 2008) . From acute infection onward, distinct differences in pathophysiology between Asian and African species begin to emerge. In African species, CD4\u00fe T cell numbers remain stable throughout chronic infection despite continued elevations in viral load that result in high set points of 10 4 e10 6 RNA copies/ml of plasma. Further loss of mucosal T cell populations does not occur in African species and mucosal immunity is preserved. In contrast, loss of both circulating and mucosal CD4\u00fe T cells is progressive in rhesus macaques.",

A key factor may be the fact that there is a marked reduction in the degree of immune activation following transition from the acute to the chronic phase of infection. Activation of CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T cells resulting in apoptosis of uninfected, bystander cells is believed to contribute substantially to the observed depletion of uninfected CD4\u00fe and CD8\u00fe T cells occurring with HIV/SIV progression to AIDS (Hazenberg et al., 2000 (Hazenberg et al., , 2003 Deeks et al., 2004; Holm and Gabuzda, 2005) . By maintaining an anti-inflammatory phenotype, SIV-infected African species experience reduced activation-induced cell death and preservation of T cell homeostasis (Kornfeld et al., 2005; Cumont et al., 2008; Meythaler et al., 2009) . The ability of the nef product of SIVsmm and SIVagm to more efficiently down-regulate the CD3-TCR from the surface of infected CD4\u00fe T cells may contribute to reductions in immune activation (Brenchley et al., 2008 ). An additional contributing factor to the maintenance of CD4\u00fe T cell counts in African species is the preservation of T cell regenerative capacity of bone marrow, thymus, and lymphoid compartments.",

Normal progression is characterized by a peak viral load of approximately 10 7 RNA copies/ml of plasma at 2 weeks post-inoculation. The humoral and cellular immune responses control viral replication to a set point of approximately 10 5 RNA copies/ml. The disease course averages about 18 months at which point CD4\u00fe T cell counts typically drop below 300 cells/mm 3 and opportunistic infections develop. Elite controllers have a vigorous cell-mediated and humoral immune response and are able to limit viral replication. Viral load in these animals peaks at approximately 10 5 RNA copies/ml. During chronic infection viral replication remains below the level of detection and CD4\u00fe T cell counts are within normal limits. In contrast, rapid progressors have high viral loads that peak at 10 8 RNA copies/ml and remain high throughout the course of infection. These animals demonstrate a reduced antibody response and a survival of only 3e4 months.",

            "text": "A combination of host, viral, and environmental factors likely influence the progression profile observed in a given animal. Host factors include species or subspecies, age, and genotype. Cynomolgus macaques inoculated with SIV-mac251 have lower viral loads, higher CD4\u00fe T cell counts, stronger virus-specific immune responses, and prolonged survival when compared to similarly inoculated rhesus macaques (Reimann et al., 2005) . Likewise, Chinese origin rhesus macaques demonstrate significantly lower viral loads, less prominent depletion of intestinal lymphocyte populations, stronger antibody response, and prolonged survival when compared to similarly inoculated Indian origin rhesus macaques (Ling et al., 2002; Trichel et al., 2002) . Genotype also plays a significant role. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II gene products are cell surface glycoproteins involved in the presentation of peptides to CD8\u00fe and CD4\u00fe T cells, respectively. The rhesus macaque MHC region, designated by the prefix Mamu, demonstrates significant diversity due to the expression of multiple genes per haplotype (Otting et al., 2005) . Certain MHC class I alleles such as Mamu-A*01, Mamu-B*17, and Mamu-B*08 have been associated with slower SIV disease progression, lower viral set points, or an increased likelihood of expressing an elite controller phenotype (Sauermann, 2001) . Additional genetic polymorphisms are an area of scientific interest. Particular alleles encoding the cytoplasmic tripartite motif protein 5a (TRIM5a) are associated with a reduced efficiency of binding to viral capsid in vitro and a significant lower viral load set points in vivo (Lim et al., 2010) . Polymorphisms in genes coding for chemokine receptors (CCR5, CXCR6, GPR15), chemokine receptor ligands (RANTES), proteins serving as disruptors to viral life cycle (APOBEC3 family), and cytokines (IL-10, TNFa) have also been investigated as potential host factors (Yu et al., 2004; Weiler et al., 2006) . Viral factors may also attenuate, accelerate or alter disease phenotype. SIVsmm and SIVmac strains vary from those that are minimally to highly pathogenic in macaque species (Hirsch and Lifson, 2000) . Viral factors include source, strain, and tissue culture passage history. Uncloned isolates tend to be more pathogenic than molecularly cloned viruses. There are exceptions; the molecularly cloned SIVmac239 is highly pathogenic in rhesus macaques. Modification of certain regions of the viral genome can result in variable virulence. Deletion of nef reduces the pathogenic potential of SIVmac239 in rhesus macaques as evidenced by decreased viral load, a strong and persistent antibody response, and decreased risk of SAIDS (Kestler et al., 1991) . Deletion of the vif sequence has also been shown to result in significant attenuation of virulence . Targeted mutation of the viral genome to produce attenuated strains represents an important avenue of investigation in the search for a HIV vaccine.",

Surrounding these foci are evidence of myelin degeneration and the formation of scattered glial nodules.

Although several opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium avium, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba spp., Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and cytomegalovirus may be responsible, in many instances secondary opportunistic agents are lacking. In these cases symptoms are attributed to a direct SIV enteropathy equivalent to AIDS enteropathy in humans. Experimental evidence now indicates that the gastrointestinal tract is a major target organ during primary infection due in large part to the number of CCR5\u00fe CD4\u00fe T lymphocytes that are normally present in mucosal tissue. These cells are rapidly depleted during primary infection resulting in compromise of mucosal immunity (Veazey et al., 1998) . CD4\u00fe T cell loss, as well as loss of intestinal epithelial cells, appears to result from apoptosis during the first 7e14 days post-inoculation . Lesions are characterized by villous blunting and atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and presence of infiltrating macrophages. Compromise of the intestinal mucosa is thought to result in microbial translocation which may then enhance the systemic immune activation observed to correlate with SIV/HIV progression (Brenchley et al., 2006) .",

Inoculation of rhesus macaques via intranasal or intratracheal routes resulted in evidence of diffuse alveolar damage characterized by the accumulation of edema, fibrin, and cellular debris within alveolar spaces and accompanied by epithelial desquamation, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, hyaline membrane formation, and syncytial cells . Despite the characteristic appearance of the described lesions, most experimental infections in nonhuman primates do not reach the level of severity observed in human patients succumbing to respiratory failure . A more recent report suggests that infection of aged macaques resulted in a stronger innate immune response and thus was associated with lesions of greater severity (Smits et al., 2010) . Common marmosets also have demonstrated utility as an animal model of SARS-CoV (Greenough et al., 2005) . Intratracheally inoculated marmosets developed a multifocal to coalescing pneumonitis with multinucleate syncytia and type 2 hyperplasia. Diffuse alveolar damage was not observed.
