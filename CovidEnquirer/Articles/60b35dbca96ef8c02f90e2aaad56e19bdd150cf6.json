            "text": "The uptake of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles by cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS) results in hepatic, splenic, bone marrow, and nodal iron accumulation. 1, 2 The selective accumulation of these particles by the MPS is exploited at organ-specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The biodynamics of iron oxide nanoparticles vary depending on particle diameter. Unlike SPIO preparations comprised of large particles and magnetite microspheres (mean particle diameter, 72 nm and 1-5 \u00b5m, respectively), ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles (mean diameter, 18 nm) are not immediately recognized by the hepatic and splenic MPS. 11, 12 The resultant prolongation of its intravascular half-life, together with its inherent T1 shortening properties, render USPIO a useful magnetic resonance angiography blood-pool agent. 13, 14 In contrast to large-particle superparamagnetic agents, the size of USPIO particles allows the extravasation of USPIO through capillary pores, the diameters of which range from 5 to 100 nm, and this capillary permeability facilitates the uptake of USPIO in MPS cells throughout the body. 15 Although information on the biodynamics of iron oxide nanoparticles of different diameters is important for various organ-specific MRI studies, to date this issue has not been addressed histologically. Therefore, a comparative histological study of the sequential biodynamics of USPIO and SPIO was performed. ",

USPIO was distributed to the liver as early as 30 minutes postinjection; it peaked at 3 hours and decreased thereafter. SPIO appeared later and its distribution throughout the liver increased over time. At 12 hours postinjection, the hepatic distribution of both agents was comparable.

The peritoneal cavity is the origin of two major lymphatic networks: the thoracic duct drains the retroperitoneal region and enters the left subclavian vein; the right lymphatic duct collects lymph from parasternal and intercostal-paravertebral lymph ducts and drains mainly through the diaphragm and, ultimately, into the right subclavian vein. In the former network, lymph passes through iliac, renal, splenic, posterior gastric, portal, superior mesenteric, and cisternal lymph nodes; in the latter network it passes through more distal (eg, parathymic) and left and right posterior mediastinal lymph nodes. 26, 27 The authors posited that there was not only USPIO present in abundant amounts in the lymphatic tracts due to these networks but also SPIO, which tended to be trapped in the liver with only slight distribution to the lymph nodes. Cultured macrophages absorbed SPIO more readily than USPIO. Under conditions where the same number of macrophages respond to iron oxide compounds containing the same amount of iron, larger particles are recognized more easily. This is consistent with the hypothesis that upon intravenous (IV) infusion, reticuloendothelial cells in the liver and spleen trap SPIO more readily than USPIO. This study had some limitations. First, the number of mice was too small for an accurate elucidation of the pharmacokinetics and prevented the exclusion of interindividual differences. Second, it could not be confirmed that the minute amounts of USPIO and SPIO used were injected accurately into the peritoneal cavity. In some instances, the agent might have been injected subcutaneously or into the bowel. Third, due to technical challenges, the pharmacokinetics of intravenously delivered USPIO or SPIO was not studied. However, considering the mechanisms by which USPIO reached the liver earlier than SPIO and the result that similar amounts of USPIO and SPIO were distributed throughout the lymph nodes, it is important to compare the differences of distribution between USPIO and SPIO via two different injection routes (IP and IV).",

The IP delivery of USPIO might also be used as a contrast agent for studying the liver. As IP delivery is not a popular injection route in clinical settings, drugs or contrast agents are currently intraperitoneally injected in limited cases of patients with cancer, peritonitis, or chronic renal failure requiring continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). 24, [28] [29] [30] Although clinical application is limited, the authors suggest, for cases of patients with ascites of unknown origin, that intraperitoneally injected iron particles may be very useful for getting Kupffer images of the liver and lymph node images to help diagnose metastases in these areas. Also, in cases of iron-deficient CAPD patients, intraperitoneally injected iron dextran has potential for filling both roles, as a route of entry in iron therapy and as a contrast agent for the liver and lymph nodes. In addition, depending on the diameter of the administered particles, it may be possible to deliver agents other than USPIO and SPIO intraperitoneally for the study of various organs.",
