The pig appears to be a convenient animal model for studies on the pathogenesis of viral enteritis, as well as on the nature of early non-specific defence mechanisms against neonatal diarrhea; indeed, the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, produces an acute and fatal disease and induces high amounts of intestinal interferon (IFN) [7] . In addition to IFN, the presence of spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity (SCMC) was investigated as a potential non-specific defence against enteropathogenic viruses. SCMC, or natural killing (NK), has been described in various mammalian and avian species [5, 4, 9] , and there is increasing interest in its possible role in host defence against disease [5] . The treatment of rodent or human lymphocytes with IFN, or the infection of rodents with different viruses greatly increases SCMC [2, 3, 4, 13] but to our knowledge no similar data are available for other animal species.",

Human alFN (2 \u2022 10 ~ Ug/ml) signitieantly increased SCMC (p < 0.01 in paired t test with data froln nine different cell preparations). This enhancement was dose-dependent and had already been observed with 2 \u2022 10 ~ Ug/ml ( fig. 1) . Furthermore, the IFN, boosting ,, effect was also observed against two other hulnan tumour cell lines (CEM and PI)e-B1 [9] ) and was inhibited by anti ~IFN antiserum (data not shown).",

It therefore appears that prolonged UV irradiation abolishes the ability of the virus to induce IFN and SCMC enhancement. Indeed, such a result was observed in preliminary experiments with TGEV.
