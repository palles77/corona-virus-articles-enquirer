The nursing staff swirl screening swabs from various sites into a single SMB that is labelled with the patient's identification details. This precludes the need to label several swabs and saves time. The broths are incubated for 18-24 h in the laboratory and the results of negative tests are available within 24 h. MRSA-positive specimens take up to 48 h because SMB has to be subcultured and the presence of MRSA has to be confirmed because of the relatively low specificity of SMB.",

However, it is equally important to ensure that healthcare personnel are using these masks correctly. In November 2003, 12 members of staff on our respiratory ward were trained on the correct method for putting on respirator masks (Tecnol fluid N95 particulate filter, Kimberly Clark); they were asked to cascade this training on to remaining staff on the ward. In February 2004, with help from the suppliers, we returned to test the adequacy of mask fitting by staff. This involved staff putting on a mask using their normal method and then wearing a plastic hood into which a saccharin solution was aerosolized. They were then asked to read a paragraph of text and any tasting of saccharin during this time was regarded as a mask-fit failure, demonstrating to staff that this left them exposed to infectious agents. The results are shown in Table I . The majority of staff who had not been trained failed the test. Although there was a greater degree of success amongst those formally trained, they still failed to comply with the manufacturer's instructions in all aspects, which suggests that their future success may be haphazard.",

Only three out of 44 clinical staff passed the fit test; 30/33 nurses and all medical staff, including nine consultants, failed. Subsequently, the correct method of mask use was demonstrated followed by testing; the effectiveness of the mask was demonstrated for every individual using the hood and all passed the fit test. This experience has highlighted several areas. In particular, it re-emphasizes that just because a piece of equipment is technically sufficient for purpose does not mean that it will provide the required protection when called upon in practice. It also suggests that training may be of limited value if the relevance to the individual is not clearly demonstrated. We have changed our practice and now recommend that staff working in high-risk areas receive training on mask fitting at induction and pass a fit test. We also recommend that staff in these areas are tested annually. We have found that these tests not only give us assurance regarding performance, but they have given every member of staff real confidence in these relatively simple masks and brought home to them what failure might represent.
