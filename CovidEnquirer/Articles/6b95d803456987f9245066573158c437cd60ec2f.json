Twenty-six-day-old weaned [PEDV-inoculated (n = 11); mock (n = 9)] and 9-day-old nursing pigs [PEDV-inoculated (n = 9); mock (n = 11)] were inoculated orally [8.9 log 10 genomic equivalents (GE)/pig] with PC21A strain or mock (MEM). Pigs were monitored for clinical signs and PEDV RNA titers in feces and serum. For pathology and immunofluorescence staining for Ki67 (marker for crypt proliferation) and LGR5 (marker for crypt stem cell), 3-4 pigs were euthanized at postinoculation days (PIDs) 1, 3 and 5. Severe watery diarrhea and atrophic enteritis with moderate to high PEDV RNA titers in feces (7.5-12.2 log 10 GE/ml) and low viral RNA titers in serum (5.6-8.6 log 10 GE/ml) were observed in all inoculated nursing piglets at PIDs 1-5. In contrast, weaned pigs did not show evidence of PEDV infection at PID 1. Pigs exhibited high fecal shedding titers at PIDs 2-5 and mild to severe atrophic enteritis at PIDs 3-5, indicating a longer incubation for PEDV infection. While uninoculated or inoculated 27-31-day-old pigs showed large numbers of Ki67-or LGR5-positive cells in the intestinal crypts, there was a lack of LGR5-positive cells and low proliferation of crypts in jejunum of uninoculated 10-14-day-old piglets, possibly causing a slower turnover of enterocytes; however, the number of LGR5-positive cells and proliferation of intestinal crypts increased remarkably at 3-5 days after inoculation. Biologic mediators that promote crypt stem cell regeneration would be targets to improve the intestinal epithelium renewal during PEDV infection.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of the genera Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in seronegative nursing piglets. PEDV is enveloped and pleomorphic with a range in diameter of 95-190 nm, including the spikes (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) . PEDV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb (excluding the poly A-tail) that encodes 4 structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid protein) and 4 nonstructural proteins (1a, 1b, 3a, and 3b) (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . PEDV has resulted in significant economic losses, initially only in the European and Asian swine industries over the last 3 decades. Recently, however, PEDV was first reported in the United States in May 2013 in Iowa and has spread nationally (Stevenson et al., 2013) . PEDV outbreaks in the US have led to significant economic impacts as a result of the high mortality among seronegative nursing piglets and decreased pork production (Cima, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013) . The US PEDV (PC21A strain) was highly enteropathogenic in experimentally infected, 10-35-day-old gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs, as evident by severe clinical disease and lesions (Jung et al., 2014) .",

The proliferative level of intestinal crypt cells determines the turnover time of enterocytes in pigs. The turnover rate of the intestinal epithelium may also depend on stem cells in the intestinal crypts. Intestinal stem cells consist mainly of three cell types: leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5-positive crypt base columnar cells (LGR5-positive crypt cells), +4 cells, and Paneth cells (Sato and Clevers, 2013) ; however, the presence of Paneth cells in the intestine of swine is debatable (Burkey et al., 2009) . Intestinal crypt stem cells may be critical for the epithelial cell renewal during PEDV infection.",

The SPF herd was seronegative for antibodies to PRRSV, PRCV, TGEV and porcine circovirus type 2. To mimic field conditions of nursing piglets, two sows were allowed to farrow naturally and nurse their piglets freely throughout the experiment. Twenty 9-day-old nursing piglets were randomly assigned to one of two groups and housed separately: PEDV infected (n = 9) and mock (n = 11). Additionally, twenty 26-day-old weaned pigs were randomly assigned to one of two groups with each housed separately: PEDV infected (n = 11) and Mock (n = 9). Weaned pigs were given free access to water and pelleted feed. Each experimental group of pigs was housed in a separate room in a high-security isolation facility (biosafety level 2).",

Our study confirmed that the US PEDV PC21A is highly enteropathogenic in conventional, seronegative nursing piglets, as evident by severe watery diarrhea and atrophic enteritis with moderate to high fecal shedding titers (7.5-12.2 log 10 GE/ml) and viral RNA in serum (5.6-8.6 log 10 GE/ml) in all inoculated 9-12-day-old pigs at PIDs 1-5. In contrast, during the acute stage of infection, conventional seronegative, 26-day-old weaned pigs appeared resistant to PC21A strain, as manifested by little clinical disease, fecal virus shedding, and gross and histologic intestinal lesions at PID 1. Thereafter, however, it was notable that the inoculated weaned pigs exhibited high fecal viral shedding titers at PIDs 2-5 and mild to severe atrophic enteritis at PIDs 3-5. A longer LGR5-positive scores were computed by estimating the number of IF-positive cells in the intestinal section per microscopic area, at \u00c2200 magnification based on the following criteria: 0, no positive cells; 1, 1-29% of LGR5-positive crypt epithelial cells showed staining; 2, 30-59% of LGR5-positive crypt epithelial cells showed staining; and 3, 60-100% of LGR5-positive crypt epithelial cells showed staining. Each bar represents the mean AE SDM.

Regardless of the infection stage, all inoculated nursing piglets at PIDs 1-5 commonly exhibited high fecal consistency scores (all scores, 3). Based on these observations, PEDV-infected nursing piglets are mostly clinical and shed large amounts of viruses (viral RNA) in the diarrheic feces during the early to later stages of infection.

This observation confirms that sub-clinical PEDV-infected weaned pigs are able to shed a large amount of viruses (viral RNA) to infect other na\u00efve pigs (Madson et al., 2014) . It was notable that at PIDs 3-5, the inoculated weaned pigs (11/12 pigs tested) also showed low viral RNA titers in the sera. None of the PEDV-inoculated weaned pigs tested at PID 1 showed clinical disease (0/8 pigs tested), gross and histologic intestinal lesions (0/8 pigs tested), and PEDV antigen-positive cells in the intestine (0/8 pigs tested). The low frequency of fecal virus shedding (1/8 pigs tested) coincided with the similar low rate of detection of viral RNA in the serum samples of the corresponding pigs (1/8 pigs tested) and low fecal shedding RNA titer (mean, 4.9 log 10 GE/ml) at this time-point and the finding that weaned pigs did not show evidence of PEDV infection at PID 1 (delayed onset). This indicates that weaned pigs failed to show evidence of US PEDV strain PC21A infection at PID 1. Significantly greater innate immune responses in ileum and blood at PID 1 may have contributed to the early resistance of weaned pigs to PEDV infection, compared to nursing piglets (Annamalai, T., Jung, K., Saif, L.J., unpublished) . As observed in PEDV-inoculated nursing piglets at PID 1, high fecal shedding PEDV RNA titers were mostly accompanied by moderate viral RNA titers in serum. Overall, rather than the severity of clinical disease, the level of viremia in PEDV-infected pigs may relate to the severity of atrophic enteritis and structural alteration of tight and adherens junctions in the jejunal and ileal villous epithelium in a manner dependent on the extent of PEDV replication (reflected by fecal viral RNA shedding titer) in the intestine (Jung et al., 2015a,b) . The 2 sows and all weaned pigs used in our study were confirmed negative for PEDV antibodies by ELISA.",

At PIDs 1-5, however, the large intestine of inoculated nursing piglets was mostly accumulated with large amounts of yellowish fluid, which coincided with the high frequency of severe watery diarrhea for the period. Large amounts of diarrheic fluid filled the small intestine of PEDV-inoculated weaned pigs at PID 5, but stools in the large intestinal lumen appeared solid. By pathological examinations, the structurally normal large intestine of PEDV-infected weaned pigs may contribute to reabsorption of the large amount of water accumulated or released from the small intestinal lumen, thereby maintaining hydration and leading to a rapid recovery from disease in weaned pigs.

After PEDV inoculation, however, the number of LGR5-positive crypt stem cells and proliferation of intestinal crypt cells in nursing piglets increased remarkably at PIDs 3 and 5, likely leading to replacement of necrotic enterocytes shed from infected villi. On the other hand, the uninoculated weaned pigs tested at PIDs 1-5 exhibited high numbers of proliferating intestinal crypt cells and LGR5-positive crypt stem cells, likely contributing to the rapid turnover rate of enterocytes. The high proliferation rates and LGR5-positive scores in the intestinal crypts were maintained after PEDV inoculation, ultimately influencing the rapid recovery from disease in weaned pigs.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the high mortality of PEDV-infected, seronegative nursing piglets is likely associated with extensive dehydration as a result of severe villous atrophy. Partially based on our data, in infected nursing piglets, there are increased proliferation of crypt cells and numbers of LGR5 + crypt stem cells in the intestine, reorganization of the damaged intestinal epithelium, and migration of mature enterocytes to the tips of villi which may be not sufficient to prevent severe dehydration in nursing piglets. This process is essential for efficient digestion and adsorption of milk or water. The rapid dehydration of PEDV-infected nursing piglets in the field limits recovery from the disease through the naturally occurring epithelial cell renewal by crypt stem cells. Pharmacologic or biologic mediators such as epidermal growth factor that promote stem cell regeneration or maturation would be interesting targets to use to try to shorten the time for epithelial cell renewal and reduce PEDV death losses among nursing pigs from dehydration.",
