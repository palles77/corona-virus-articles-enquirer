A total of 1421 patents are retrieved from USPTO patent database and patent citation network is established by combing both patent citation and social network analysis. Network properties, e.g. Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Closeness Centrality, are calculated for representing several technology evolution mechanisms that first proposed in this study. Also, a distance-based patent citation map is constructed by calculating relative distances and positions of patents in the patent citation network. Quantitative ways of exploring technology evolution are investigated in this study to unveil important or emerging techniques as well as to demonstrate dynamics and visualization of technology evolutions.",

Former publications can be served as important references or bases for later publication, in this way human knowledge can be gradually accumulated to sustain and expand knowledge system. The important featuring characteristic of patent and scientific publication for knowledge accumulation is their citations showing which former literatures have been contributed to this paper/patent and providing the context of knowledge accumulation. A number of researches have noted that patent citations trace out technological building relationships among inventions [46, 47] . Also, citation has been widely used in bibliometric study to evaluate technology development, research performance, and even map knowledge evolution or technological trajectory. For instance, Acosta investigated the links between science and technology based on an analysis of scientific citations in patent documents to study in greater depth the relationship between science and technological development in the various regions of Spain [48] , Hall et al. suggested that of all patent related indicators, patent citation is a more adequate indicator to evaluate market value [49] , Stuart and Podolny used patent citations to measure firms' technological niches and niche shifts [50] .",

Accordingly, this study aims to use the alternative citation-based method to avoid the problem of lacking causal knowledge accumulation if only keywords are considered in the analysis, and reap reward from the well-assigned citations in structured patent documents for drawing an overview of how electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite technology is evolved. In summary, patent citation information allows the building of patent linkages which eventually lead to a patent citation network as a whole. The constructed patent citation network, with patents as network nodes (actors) and patent citation as network ties, allows quantitative analysis on patent citation network by calculating network properties, e.g. Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Closeness Centrality. In this sense, mechanism of knowledge flow or technology evolution mechanism, e.g. technology convergence, technology diffusion, etc., can be quantitatively analyzed.",

Validation is done by comparing the content of classified patents with multiple sources and through informal interviews with members of the expert panel. It is worth noted that one single patent may disclose more than one matrix material or more than one function, one patent thus can be categorized into more than one classification, so the total patent count in Table 1 is 824 instead of the original 672. The classification of \"other\" in both matrix and function in Table 1 are either some other materials or functions not considered in this study, or more than three matrices or functions are disclosed in one single patent trying to reduce the specificity of its disclosed matrix or function. The obtained technology-function matrix shown in Table 1 provides an overview, or a so-called \"patent map\", for the development of nanocomposite material. Subsequently, this research selects 69 patents with the technology of \"polymer\" matrix and function of \"electrical conductivity\" to meet the requirement of the research target set in this study.",

In summary, this research uses 1) primary patents: the 69 patents with polymer matrix and function of electrical conductivity, and 2) secondary patents: 690 backward citation patents of the 69 primary patents and 716 forward citation patents of the 69 primary patents, as actors of the patent citation network to be drawn in this study. The total number of obtained patents is 1421 instead of 1475 (the sum of primary patents and secondary patents) after removal of duplicated count (some patents belong to both primary and secondary patents). The 1421 patents are defined as \"network patents\" and are therefore treated as network actors (node), along with the network ties built by patent citation linkages, a patent citation network for understanding the development context of electrical conducting polymer nanocomposite can be achieved.",

The higher centrality indicates more associations with actors in a network. Brass and Burkhardt [54] pointed out the higher centrality of a person in a social network, the more power s/he possesses from the viewpoint of organizational behavior.
