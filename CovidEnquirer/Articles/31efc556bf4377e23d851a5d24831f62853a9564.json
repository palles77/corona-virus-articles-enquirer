These markers have molecular weights of 0.67 x 106, 1.75 x lo6 (MeMaster and Carmichael, 19'77) , and 4.3 x lo6 (Kaarilinen and Soderlund, 19781, respectively.

Figure 2A shows that purification of the RNAs on oligo(dT)-cellulose leads to sharper bands except for RNAl. This RNA remains present as a broad and diffuse band. This could be due to the presence of A-U base pairs which are not denatured with glyoxal. Therefore we have used agarose gels containing 6 M urea for electrophoresis. From comparing lane 2 and 4 from Fig. 2 it is clear that the presence of urea indeed results in sharper bands also for RNAl.

There were two kinds of artifacts that we wanted to exclude, namely (a) that defective interfering (DI) particles had accumulated in our virus stocks and (b) that the six smaller viral RNA species were degradation products of the genome sized 5.6 x lo6 dalton RNA. Possibility (a) could be ruled out since RNA extracted from virions grown in a replicate culture of cells that made the seven virus-specific RNAs contained only one species of RNA, with a mass of 5.6 x lo6 daltons (Fig. 2B ); if DI particles had been formed smaller RNAs would have been found. The following control experiments to test (b) were carried out: Sac(-) cells were infected with MHV-A59 as described above; act D was added but no [3H]uridine. Just before lysis of the cells [3H]uridine-labeled MHV-A59 was added and RNA was extracted from the mixture and analyzed. Virion RNA was not degraded in the extract of infected cells.

The postnuclear supernatants from control cells and virus-infected act D-treated cells labeled with E3H]uridine were analyzed by sedimentation in iso-kinetic sucrose gradients (Fig. 3) . As expected, no [3H]uridine was incorporated into RNA from mock-infected cells. In gradients loaded with lysates from infected cells two peaks were present: one sedimenting from 80 to 200 S and one at about 230 S. To determine whether the RNA sedimenting in the gradient was ribosomeassociated, EDTA was added to the cell extract before analysis. The slower sedimenting material was EDTA-sensitive and remained at the top of the gradient. Treatment with EDTA did not alter the sedimentation of the bulk of the material present in the 230 S peak, indicating that this RNA is not polyribosome-associated (Fig. 3 ). RNA extracted from every fourth gradient fraction was analyzed by electrophoresis in an agarose gel (Fig. 4A) . Seven virus-specific RNA species were detected throughout the sucrose gradient; they had the same apparent molecular weights as the intracellular RNAs described above. The mRNA species released with EDTA and the RNA present in the EDTAresistant peak were also analyzed. The .

Finally the uv target size of the RNAs decreases with their molecular weight (C. E. Jacobs, W. J. M. Spaan, and B. A. M. van der Zeijst, unpublished data).
