However, a number of problems confront the cytopathologist on a daily basis because of limitations of conventional cytologic features. Adjunct techniques can be utilized to give additional information, which allows one to reach a defi nitive diagnosis. These techniques must be used in parallel with conventional cytologic features and include immunodiagnostics for cellular origin, electron microscopy for presence of subcellular structures, special histochemical stains for demonstration of chemical constituents, fl ow cytometry and image analysis for a quantitative evaluation of cellular markers, and molecular diagnostics for clonality or chromosomal abnormalities. In this chapter, we discuss adjunct diagnostic techniques and focus on both their applications in cytopathology and histopathology.",

            "text": "The detection of antigens by immunologic and chemical reactions in tissue sections (immunohistochemistry-IHC-), or cytologic preparations (immunocytochemistry-ICC-) has become one of the most commonly used ancillary morphologic techniques in diagnostic pathology (Barr and Wu, 2006) . The advantages of IHC and ICC are: 1) They do not require the use of expensive equipment. 2) Both prospective and retrospective studies can be done on a variety of samples. 3) Antigen detection can be correlated with morphologic changes (IHC) and its cellular location (ICC). 4) Stained slides can be stored for many months. 5) Routine processing of samples is usually acceptable for these techniques. Both IHC and ICC are practical in the characterization of poorly differentiated neoplasms, differentiation of primary from metastatic tumors, and determination of sites of origin of metastatic lesions and prognostic assessments (DeLellis and Hoda, 2006) . The general consensus is that IHC/ICC methods, if properly applied and interpreted, increase diagnostic accuracy in pathology. Technical aspects of IHC and ICC, interpretation of results, and pitfalls will be reviewed. An algorithmic approach to the diagnosis of tumors, the diagnosis of metastatic disease, and the use of antibodies as prognostic markers will be presented. This review will not include detailed IHC or ICC procedures. For this purpose, the reader is referred to other published material (Polak and Van Noorden, 2003; Ramos-Vara and Saeteele, 2007) .",

Polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies can be used. In general, polyclonal antibodies are usually raised in rabbits and have higher affi nity but lower specifi city than monoclonal antibodies. Cross-reactivity (defi ned as recognition of unrelated antigens) is more common with polyclonal antibodies. Key in the use of polyclonal antibodies in diagnostic IHC/ICC is their degree of purifi cation (examples of commercially available antibodies include whole serum antibodies, antibodies purifi ed by precipitation of immunoglobulins, and immunoglobulins purifi ed by affi nity chromatography). Monoclonal antibodies, produced in mice using the hybridoma technology, recognize a single epitope (a 4-8 amino acid chain in a protein) and therefore are highly specifi c and have constant characteristics among different batches of antibody. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies are increasingly being used in human diagnostic IHC, but despite their reported advantages over mouse monoclonal antibodies (e.g., higher affi nity, no need for antigen retrieval, use on mouse tissues), some of them neither react on animal tissues nor perform better than mouse monoclonal antibodies (Reid et al., 2007; Vilches-Moure and Ramos-Vara, 2005) .

            "text": "The universal fi xative for histopathology and diagnostic IHC is buffered formalin. Attempts to replace formalin fi xative in diagnostic IHC have failed, although for specifi c situations the use of nonformaldehyde fi xatives, particularly glyoxal-based, has been reported (Yaziji and Barry, 2006) . Fixation is necessary for preservation of cellular components, to prevent autolysis and displacement of cell constituents, to stabilize cellular materials (antigens), and to facilitate conventional staining and immunostaining (Ramos-Vara, 2005) . The use of formalin is not without problems. First, the quality of formalin solutions varies widely in regard to concentration of formaldehyde, pH, and presence of preservatives. Second, formalin fi xation, by producing methylene bridges between amino groups and other functional groups, alters the tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins and forms cross-links between soluble tissues and proteins. These chemical reactions may modify the targeted epitope. Amino acids that are especially sensitive to formalin fi xation include lysine, glycine, tyrosine, arginine, histidine, and serine. Despite the fact that formalin fi xation may impair immunohistochemical detection, good fi xation is paramount to detect antigens with IHC. Underfi xation is as bad as or worse than overfi xation, and is a fairly common problem due to reduced turnaround times in diagnostic laboratories. With the advent of heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER), overfi xation or variable fi xation time among samples is less critical in the detection antigens targeted in human diagnostic IHC (Webster et al., 2009) . The same will probably be true with common antigens demonstrated in animal samples. Autolysis is a common problem in diagnostic pathology. Studies addressing the effects of autolysis in IHC have shown that most antigens are still detectable despite decomposition; however, caution in the interpretation of autolyzed material is necessary due to the loss of detection of some antigens (Maleszewski et al., 2007) . Necrotic tissue tends to produce more background than normal tissue; however, IHC of necrotic tissue can provide valuable information when no other tissue is available, particularly for cytokeratins and CD45. Decalcifi cation of formalin-fi xed tissues generally does not reduce the immunoreactivity of most antigens, particularly when using weak acids; some loss of reactivity is apparent when using strong acids for decalcifi cation, but it does not affect all antigens.",

Autolyzed samples or those with biopsy artifacts should be avoided. For IHC and ICC, samples are mounted onto silanized slides, poly-L-lysine-coated slides, or charged slides to allow a strong bond between the slide and the tissue section. Pooling of reagents under the tissue section or tissue loss can occur when using noncharged slides or slides without special coatings. Complete deparaffi nation is critical to achieve optimal immunostaining. Deparaffi nation is somewhat cumbersome and there are commercial products to perform deparaffi nation and antigen retrieval simultaneously although results may not be completely satisfactory.

            "text": "As previously mentioned, formalin fi xation modifi es the tertiary structure of proteins, often rendering antigens undetectable by specifi c antibodies. A factor in the binding of antibodies to antigens is their conformational fi t, which may be modifi ed during fi xation. Antigen retrieval (AR) is intended to reverse the changes produced during fi xation. In addition to conformational changes in the structure of proteins, fi xation produces major changes in the electrostatic charge of proteins (antigens), which is critical for the initial attraction between antigens and antibodies. Therefore, recovery of the electrostatic charges lost during formalin fi xation has been proposed as another mechanism of antigen retrieval for many (but not all) proteins. In other words, it appears that more than one mechanism may be involved in the lack of recognition of antigens by antibodies after fi xation in cross-linking fi xatives. The two more common AR procedures include proteolytic enzymes (e.g., pronase, trypsin, proteinase K) and immersion of slides in buffer at high temperature. Each antibody may react differently to antigen retrieval and therefore it is necessary to test several methods when optimizing the IHC procedure although some HIER procedures appear to produce optimal results in a wide variety of antibodies. With the variety of AR methods available, standardization of IHC methods among laboratories and comparison of results is very challenging at best. phosphatase detection methods) is blocked in procedures using this enzyme. Mammalian tissues have two alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes; the nonintestinal form is easily blocked with levamisole; the intestinal isoform unfortunately requires acetic acid to be blocked, a chemical that can damage some antigens. Numerous tissues have endogenous avidin-biotin activity that must be blocked before adding biotinylated reagents in avidin-biotin detection systems. Nonspecifi c binding of immunoglobulins to tissue is blocked by incubating tissue sections with bovine serum albumin or serum from the same species as the secondary reagent before the incubation with the primary antibody. There are commercially available reagents to block endogenous activities and nonspecifi c immunoglobulin binding.",

The sensitivity of the immunohistochemical reaction is mostly the result of the detection method used (Ramos-Vara, 2005) ; progress in this regard has been dramatic in the last decade. Two main enzymes are used in IHC: peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. Peroxidase is probably the enzyme most commonly used, but in some occasions, particularly with heavily pigmented samples or samples rich in endogenous peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase is an excellent alternative. Current IHC methods can be divided into avidin-biotin or non-avidin-biotin systems. After incubation with the primary antibody, a secondary antibody specifi c for the primary antibody (secondary reagent) is added. For avidin-biotin systems the secondary reagent is biotinylated. For avidin-biotin methods, a tertiary reagent labeled with avidin molecules and an enzyme (peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase) is needed. The most common non-avidin-biotin method is based on polymer technology. The polymers contain many molecules of secondary antibodies and enzyme. Polymer methods are usually two-step methods, whereas avidin-biotin methods are usually three-step methods.",

Optimization (standardization) of a new antibody/test is the process of serially testing and modifying components of the procedure (e.g., fi xation, antigen retrieval, antibody dilution, detection system, incubation time, etc.) with the aim of producing a consistent, high-quality assay. The reader is advised to standardize every antibody used in his/her laboratory despite the existence of published protocols, to ensure optimal results. Standardization includes adequate tissue fi xation. Tissues should be fi xed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 8 hours. Every new antibody is tested following a standard protocol that includes three pretreatments: no antigen retrieval, AR with a proteolytic enzyme (e.g., proteinase K), and HIER (e.g., citrate buffer, pH 6.0); and four, two-fold dilutions of the primary antibody . With this standard protocol, the total of slides initially processed for each antibody is 15, including a negative reagent control for each pretreatment. The positive control section used in standardization (and later in a diagnostic setting) is one in which the antigen in question has been detected with a different method (e.g., virus isolation) and its cellular location is known. A negative control section (containing cells known by independent methods to lack the antigen in question) also should be included. Usually, the same tissue block used for the positive control can be used for the negative control. Incubation of the primary antibody is done at room temperature; duration varies from 30 minutes to 2 hours. Overnight incubations (usually at 4 \u00b0C) may be beneficial, but disrupt the automation of the IHC procedure. Based on the results of this initial procedure, the optimal AR method and dilution of the primary antibody is selected as the slide with the best signal (specifi c staining)-to-noise (background staining) ratio. If staining is nonspecifi c or suboptimal, other AR methods and dilutions should be tested. Keep in mind that some antibodies raised against human antigens may not be reactive in animal tissues. For standardization, tissue samples are processed in the same way as the diagnostic samples that eventually will be tested.",

Antibodies used as tumor markers need to be tested against tumors that may be diffi cult to distinguish from the one in question (tumors with similar phenotype, e.g., round cell tumors) with routine stains and tumors present in the same location/organ . Validation should also include evaluation of staining differences among different tumors, staining differences within tumors-particularly when different phenotypes are present (e.g., spindle and epithelioid melanomas staining differences with Melan-A)-and differences between primary and metastatic tumors.

The ICC staining can be done with or without previous destaining (with acid alcohol) of the routine stain (Abendroth and Dabbs, 1995; Barr and Wu, 2006; Miller and Kubier, 2002) . However, there are some technical drawbacks to using previously stained slides: loss of cells from the slide, cell disruption (affecting mostly ICC of membranous and cytoplasmic markers), and signal reduction for some markers (e.g., S100) due to repeated passage of the sample through graded alcohols. In cases in which only a slide is available and the area containing cells is large, multiple markers can be tested simultaneously. Alternatively, the sample can be divided following tissuetransfer techniques (Sherman et al., 1994) .",

This issue is very different from diagnostic IHC, in which a universal fi xative, 10% buffered formaldehyde is used in most instances. Here we are giving general rules, but each laboratory should standardize and validate their protocols to obtain consistent results. Fixation is necessary to preserve cell integrity during multistep immunostaining procedures. Fixation should be performed immediately before immunostaining; theoretically, the type of fi xative is selected on an antibodyby-antibody basis. In general, for lymphoid and melanoma markers, samples should be fi xed for 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature in acetone; for epithelial markers, 5 minutes at room temperature in alcohol (95% ethanol or a 1:1 mixture of methanol and 100% ethanol); for nuclear antigens, 3.7% buffered formalin for 15 minutes (Fetsch and Abati, 2004) . Some authors favor formal saline as a universal fi xative suitable for most antigens (Leong et al., 1999) . S100 protein, gross cystic disease fl uid protein-15, and hormone receptors are not well demonstrated in ethanol-fi xed samples due to cytoplasmic antigen leakage (Dabbs, 2002) .",

The peroxidase block is necessary when using immunoperoxidase techniques; the usual method is with 3% H 2 0 2 in deionized water. The peroxidase blocking step can be omitted in acetone-fi xed specimens. Antigen retrieval is necessary in numerous occasions. Unfortunately, there is no rule to determine a priori whether antigen retrieval is needed or which method is optimal. The approach to standardize ICC is similar to that for IHC.

In very few cases is IHC considered a standalone technique in human or veterinary pathology. Specifi c knowledge of the right staining pattern of a given marker is extremely important to determine whether the staining is signifi cant or not. Interpretation of ICC is more challenging than that of IHC because of the diffi culty in obtaining positive and negative control samples treated in a similar way to the test sample and the additional diffi culty of distinguishing normal from neoplastic cells. As stressed in the upcoming section on immunohistochemical diagnosis of metastatic tumors, there are very few, if any, antibodies that are truly specifi c for a single cell type. The interpretation of an IHC reaction is based on the expected \"antibody personality profi le\" (see below) and the infi delity of tumor-specifi c markers (e.g., reactivity in T-cells with B-cell markers) (Yaziji and Barry, 2006) . Simultaneous presence of an antigen in more than one cellular compartment is possible in neoplastic cells, but usually results from diffusion of proteins due to cellular damage during processing. Detection of an antigen in an unusual location should be interpreted with caution and indicated in the immunohistochemical report. Generally speaking, antibodies used in IHC can be used in ICC. In addition, some antibodies that are nonreactive in surgical biopsy specimens are suitable for cytologic preparations.",

Some markers are expected to be present in most cells in a tumor (e.g., cytokeratins in a carcinoma), whereas the detection of other markers (e.g., uroplakin III in transitional cell carcinoma) in only a small group of cells is considered a positive result. Perhaps, as recommended recently in human pathology (Goldstein et al., 2007) , a statement in the IHC report indicating the intensity of the staining and the percentage of positive tumor cells would be more informative than merely a positive or negative result as provided in a recent veterinary study (H\u00f6inghaus et al., 2008) . The lack of expression of a particular antigen may be as signifi cant as its presence in prognostication (e.g., absence of expression of progesterone receptor is linked to poor outcome in human breast cancer; lack of bcl-6 expression combined with MUM1 expression in cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma is linked to short survival) (Bardou et al., 2003; Sundram et al., 2005) . In human pathology IHC antibodies are classifi ed as Class I devices by the FDA, meaning that antibodies are considered special stains as adjuncts to conventional histopathologic diagnostic examination (Rhodes, 2005) . In other words, with some exceptions, IHC is not a standalone technique and results must be interpreted by the pathologist in the context of the disease. Some IHC tests (e.g., assays for ER, PR, HER2/neu) are considered class II devices with potential predictive or prognostic value. Similarly in veterinary medicine, immunohistochemical results are part of the pathology report and need to be interpreted by the pathologist (Ramos-Vara et al., 2008) .",

This interlaboratory lack of reproducibility is signifi cant when dealing with prognostic markers (Mengel et al., 2002) . Interpretation of immunostaining is also subjective (wide range of interobserver interpretations) and a degree of knowledge of IHC and the antibodies used is required to interpret results correctly. What constitutes a positive result (percentage of positive cells needed, intensity of the reaction) is still controversial, but a critical issue for therapeutic decisions in oncology. Some tumors do not express specifi c markers beyond the generic ones, which makes testing with multiple markers expensive and unrewarding. Neoplastic cells up-and downregulate gene expression, resulting in the lack of expression of expected antigens or the expression of new antigens. All these issues are perhaps more serious in veterinary medicine, where the degree of sophistication and use of IHC techniques is not as advanced as in human pathology, and are exacerbated by interspecies differences in antigen expression and detection.",

            "text": "There are multiple causes of background staining. A common one is inadequate blocking of serum proteins. Blocking is usually done with normal serum or protein (Brown, 2001) . Bovine serum albumin has been used extensively in the past as a blocking reagent of nonspecifi c reactions. However, there is recent evidence that adding albumin to antibody and diluent solutions increases the background of immunohistochemical reactions (Mittelbronn et al., 2006) . Other causes of falsepositive staining are necrotic tissue, crushed cells, improper fi xation, incomplete blocking of endogenous peroxidase or endogenous biotin, and high concentration of the primary antibody (Dabbs, 2002) . Samples that are too thick tend to trap reagents and produce background staining. Carcinoma cells in fl uids often express vimentin and lose their immunoreactivity for cytokeratins; antigens shed into effusion fl uid can be absorbed onto the surfaces of other cells present in the same fl uid. Some antigens in cytologic samples such as factor VIII-rAg and immunoglobulins tend to diffuse into the surrounding tissue contributing to incorrect interpretation of immunostaining (Barr and Wu, 2006) . To avoid overstaining due to the concentration of the primary antibody, retitration of primary antibodies on cytologic preparations is recommended. Other causes of background staining are included elsewhere (Ramos-Vara, 2005) . When using detection kits that recognize primary antibodies made in goats, extensive background in both the positive and negative controls is observed if using tissue sections from the same or related species (ruminants) due to the presence of endogenous immunoglobulins recognized by the secondary antibody (anti-goat IgG). A similar problem is observed with rabbit monoclonal antibodies tested on rabbit tissues or mouse monoclonal antibodies tested on mouse tissues. Special detection procedures are commercially available to avoid this background staining. Although not an example of nonspecifi c background staining, it is very important in immunocytochemistry to distinguish positive staining in normal or reactive cells from that of neoplastic cells. This distinction can be challenging when the number of reactive cells is higher than that of the neoplastic cells (e.g., T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma). ",

The ideal positive control should demonstrate immunoreactivity that is weak in some places and strong in others. A negative reagent control is also necessary for each antibody tested (see Fig. 17 -2). For the negative reagent control, either an irrelevant antibody or nonimmune serum from the same species as the primary antibody (and ideally the same Ig isotype for monoclonal antibodies) replaces the primary antibody (Fetsch and Abati, 2004) . The slide with the negative reagent control should be processed in an identical manner as the slide with the primary antibody. The negative control slide is used to assess nonspecifi c staining that is not the result of specifi c antigen-antibody binding (background staining). If only one slide is available, it may be used divided into test and negative reagent control by circling the areas of interest with a diamond or wax pen or using the cell transfer technique already mentioned (DeLellis and Hoda, 2006) . In some instances, a slide negative for one marker can be used to test a second marker.",

            "text": "The goal of diagnostic IHC is to maximize sensitivity without compromising specifi city of results. A typical approach is to cover the main tumor types with antibody panels that include cytokeratins (carcinoma), vimentin (sarcoma), S-100 (melanomas or peripheral nerve sheath tumors), and CD45 (leukocytic neoplasms). To achieve maximum sensitivity, the use of \"redundant\" antibodies for a given antigen is recommended: in other words, the use of several antibodies that should label the same cell type. Table 17 -2 lists cell markers and their use in the immunochemical diagnosis of tumors, with emphasis on organ system. In human pathology, the following expanded panel has been proposed: Pan-cytokeratin (carcinomas), CD45 and CD43 (lymphomas), S-100 and Melan-A or gp 100 (melanomas), vimentin and collagen IV (sarcoma) (Yaziji and Barry, 2006) . Some of these markers are not available or not reactive in animal tissues, so alternatives need to be found. Once other clinicopathologic data has been examined judicious use of antibodies is the best approach: it will reduce both the cost of testing and the need to explain unexpected reactions to the client. Once a particular tumor group has been identifi ed (e.g., sarcoma), more specifi c markers to determine the type of tumor are used. This approach is based on B A C D \u25a0 FIGURE 17-1.

Fig. 17 -3 shows a basic algorithm to characterize tumors frequently found in domestic species. This algorithmic approach is borrowed from the human experience; unfortunately many markers currently used in human pathology are not reactive in animal tissues or their reactivity is different (in other words, when dealing with IHC, not all animal species and antibodies are created equal). This problem is compounded because the extensive testing (validation) of antibodies used in human diagnostic IHC is almost nonexistent in veterinary medicine. The lack of predictive behavior (percentage of positive cases of a tumor with a particular antibody) is one of the most diffi cult barriers to overcome in veterinary diagnostic IHC. The use of a particular marker will be also determined by its availability in the laboratory. Many antibodies with diagnostic or prognostic significance in human pathology await validation in similar tumors of animals (Capurro et al., 2003) . A similar algorithmic approach can be used in immunocytochemistry.",

This gives the diagnostician more opportunities to make a defi nitive diagnosis. Keep in mind that regardless of the number of markers used to characterize a particular tumor, the gold standard before attempting IHC should be HE. A careful examination of HE-stained slides will reduce the number of markers needed to arrive to a defi nitive diagnosis. Even after that, it is uncommon to make a defi nitive diagnosis with only one marker because expression (or lack of thereof) of proteins in tumor cells may differ from that in the normal cell counterpart. Upregulation and downregulation of gene expression and the proteins codifi ed by such genes is common in neoplastic cells. The use of tumor marker panels in the diagnosis of metastatic disease is key to improving our chances of arriving at a defi nitive diagnosis. Considering the relatively low cost of IHC and the expenses of treating some tumors, clinicians are keen to get a defi nitive A, This section of lymphoid tissue was not pretreated with hydrogen peroxide to remove endogenous peroxidase activity.

They are separated by charge into acidic (type I) and basic (type II) keratins. Cytokeratins are paired together as acidic and basic types. Most low-molecular weight keratins (e.g., CK 7, 8, 18, 20) are present in all epithelia except squamous epithelium, whereas high-molecular weight keratins (e.g., CK 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10) are typically present in squamous epithelium. Almost all mesotheliomas and carcinomas, except squamous cell carcinomas, have CK 8 and 18. The coordinate expression of CK 7 and CK 20 is one criterion to classify carcinomas in human pathology. This approach has proven very useful in metastatic carcinomas of undetermined origin. There is only one paper published regarding domestic animals that examines a wide range of carcinomas in dogs and cats for expression of CK 7 and CK 20 (Espinosa de los Monteros et al., 1999) . Results for CK 7 were similar to those in humans, but major differences were observed for CK 20 among both animal species. CK 5 is a useful marker of myoepithelial differentiation in glandular tumors as well as for squamous epithelium and mesothelial cells. Although cytokeratins are the typical marker of epithelial differentiation, they can be detected in mesenchymal tumors (melanoma, leiomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, liposarcoma, meningioma, and angiosarcoma), although usually in only a few cells, as opposed to the diffuse and strong staining of carcinomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas (Dabbs, 2006) . Coexpression of intermediate fi laments has been reported in certain human fetal and adult tissues. Some carcinomas frequently express vimentin, particularly endometrial carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, and thyroid follicular carcinoma. In a few cases, coexpression of CKs and vimentin is observed in colorectal, mammary, prostatic, and ovarian carcinomas.",

In this section are presented some markers that are useful in the characterization of specifi c animal tumors. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1), a nuclear transcription factor, is frequently expressed in thyroid tumors (more common in follicular, but also present in medullary, tumors) and pulmonary tumors (Ramos-Vara et al., 2002a . Other tumors, including mesotheliomas, are usually negative. Hep Par 1 (hepatocyte paraffi n 1) is consistently detected in hepa tocytes and their tumors with no staining of biliary epithelium, which makes it a good choice to distinguish these tumors, particularly when used in conjunction with CK 7 (Ramos-Vara et al., 2001a). However, some intestinal, and probably pancreatic, tumors can be positive (Ramos-Vara and Miller, 2002) . Melan-A is one of the best specifi c and sensitive markers of melanomas in dogs (less sensitive in feline melanomas) and certainly more specifi c than other classic markers such as S100 and NSE , 2002b . It should be noted that many steroidproducing tumors from the adrenal cortex, testis, and ovary show strong reactivity for Melan-A (Ramos-Vara et al., 2001b) . Uroplakin III, a major component of the asymmetric unit of transitional epithelium, is expressed in most canine transitional cell carcinomas and, in conjunction with CK 7, the number of transitional cell carcinomas detected approaches 100% (Ramos-Vara et al., 2003) . Uroplakin III has not been detected in nonurothelial normal or neoplastic tissues of dogs which makes this marker the exception to the rule (coexpression of the same marker in different cell types).",

However, attempts to use it in canine mesotheliomas with a variety of antibodies have been unrewarding. There is a report of calretinin staining in equine mesothelioma (Stoica et al., 2004) . The differential diagnosis of mesothelioma and pulmonary carcinoma is challenging in human pathology and numerous antibodies have been tested. A recent study indicates that the combination of D2-40 and calretinin (both positive in mesothelioma and negative in lung carcinoma) and CEA and TTF-1 (both negative in mesothelioma and positive in pulmonary carcinoma) antibodies is an economic way to distinguish these two types of tumors (Mimura et al., 2007) . Desmin is detected in reactive mesothelial cells but not in mesothelioma or carcinoma in cytologic preparations (Afi fy et al., 2002) . As previously mentioned, TTF-1 is a specifi c and sensitive marker of canine pulmonary and thyroid carcinomas. The use of CEA on animal tumors is very limited. We are not aware of D2-40 staining of mesotheliomas in animal species. The use of both cytokeratins and vimentin (usually coexpressed in mesotheliomas) is probably the best approach to distinguish mesothelioma from pulmonary carcinoma in animals (Geninet et al., 2003; Morini et al., 2006; Sato et al., 2005; Vural et al., 2007) .",

In mast cell tumors, there is good correlation between decreased survival time and Ki67 index and between the histochemical detection of nuclear organizing regions (AgNORs), which determine the rate of cellular proliferation (generation time) and decreased disease-free interval (Webster et al., 2007a) . In a different study (Scase et al., 2006) , both AgNORs and Ki67 scores were considered useful prognostic markers for canine mast cell tumors, with Ki67 score used to divide Patnaik grade 2 mast cell tumor into 2 groups showing markedly different actual survival times. PCNA score did not correlate with differences in survival times of several types of tumors (Roels et al., 1999; Scase et al., 2006; Webster et al., 2007a) .

If the markers of immunohistochemistry are structural or secretory proteins specifi c for a cell or tissue, then the markers of electron microscopy (EM) are subcellular structures such as organelles or matrix constituents. Electron microscopy has contributed in great measure to an understanding of the structural features of normal and pathologic tissues. Although the use of EM has declined in the last decade and been partially replaced by other techniques (e.g., immunohistochemistry), EM is still a very valuable tool to reach a defi nitive diagnosis in some diffi cult cases, particularly in peripheral nerve sheath tumors, some synovial sarcomas, pleomorphic sarcomas, and mesotheliomas (Dardick and Herrera, 1998; Mackay, 2007) . EM and IHC should be used in a complementary fashion based on the type of diagnostic problem (Fisher, 2006) . As an ancillary technique, EM raises the level of confi dence in diagnoses based on light microscopy. Of the three main types of ancillary techniques currently used in veterinary pathology (EM, IHC, PCR), EM is the most mature technique, meaning that it has gone through the usual stages of development, evaluation and, stabilization as opposed to the other two techniques that are still in development or evaluation stages.

Glutaraldehyde has a slower diffusion rate than formaldehyde and very small samples (around 1 mm 3 ) are required for optimal fi xation. Formaldehyde is not an optimal fi xative but in diagnostic pathology is the most commonly used primary fi xative for EM, particularly when ultrastructural studies are not considered initially in the diagnostic workup.

While this technique concentrates the mononuclear cells considerably, it is possible that cells of interest may pass through the density gradient and be lost from the analysis. For analysis of antigens expressed on the cells' surface, such as CD4 and CD8, cells are incubated with antibodies to cell surface markers. Primary antibodies are either unlabeled or have been directly conjugated to a fl uorescent molecule called a fl uorochrome. The directly conjugated antibodies can be visualized immediately after staining and they greatly facilitate the use of multiple markers simultaneously. Cells stained with unlabeled antibodies must be subjected to a second staining reaction using a labeled antibody that will recognize the immunoglobulin portion of the primary antibody. In general, only a single unconjugated antibody can be used in a staining reaction, preventing the simultaneous quantifi cation of multiple markers on individual cells. It is important to include control reactions for each sample. Controls consist of the same cells left unstained and cells stained with an antibody of the same isotype that should not specifically bind to any antigens on the cells of interest. The unstained cells allow the operator to correct for autofl uorescence, and the fl uorescent intensity of the irrelevant antibody reaction can be used to determine the level of background staining.",

Figure 17 -12 demonstrates a typical scatter plot from canine peripheral blood, where each dot represents an individual cell placed relative to the amount of forward and side scatter recorded as it passes in front of the laser.

The next step is to determine the percentage of cells within each population that expresses the markers of interest by looking at the fl uorescence profi le of each population. The fl uorochromes used to label antibodies are excited by the laser and emit a particular peak emission wavelength, which can be detected by the fl ow cytometer. Different fl uorochromes have distinct peak emission wavelengths so antibodies conjugated to two different fl uorochromes can be used simultaneously in one staining reaction. The amount of fl uorescent signal detected is proportional to the number of fl uorochrome molecules on the cell. The data can then be displayed as a single parameter in the form of a histogram, or two parameters can be displayed simultaneously as a dot plot ( Fig. 17-13) . Two-parameter dot plots allow individual events/cells to be displayed so that the relative fl uorescence for two individual markers can be displayed.",

Although normal values have been published (Byrne et al., 2000) , preparation methods differ so widely between laboratories that each lab should generate their own normal values. For other samples, percentages of lymphocyte subsets are reported usually after gating on the relevant population by size. For example, in lymph node aspirates from dogs with lymphoma, the neoplastic lymphocytes are usually large. Therefore, the percentage of each lymphocyte subset will be determined after gating on the large cells.

A number of studies have described the immunophenotypic markers of canine lymphoma and leukemia (Appelbaum et al., 1984; Day, 1995; Caniatti et al., 1996; Ruslander et al., 1997; Grindem et al., 1998; McDonough and Moore, 2000; Modiano et al., 1998; Ponce et al., 2003) . Distinguishing a reactive from a neoplastic process is often the fi rst task faced by the clinician. Finding of a phenotypically homogeneous population of lymphocytes suggests a neoplastic, rather than a reactive, process. For example, canine chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most commonly involves an expansion of CD8\u03e9 T cells, and less frequently B cells (Vernau and Moore, 1999; Workman and Vernau, 2003) . CD8 T cells usually comprise 25% to 35% of canine peripheral blood, and B cells usually comprise 5% to 20% (Byrne et al., 2000; Greeley et al., 2001) . Leukemia would be the primary differential diagnosis in a dog with persistent lymphocytosis when a majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes are CD8\u03e9 T or B cells, although no criteria have been established in veterinary medicine for making this distinction. A rare exception to such an interpretation in dogs would be lymphocytosis in Ehrlichia canis infection, which can be associated with the selective expansion of CD8\u03e9 T cells (Heeb et al., 2003; McDonough and Moore, 2000; Weiser et al., 1991) . To our knowledge, there are no such examples in cats. Studies of the predictive value of an expanded lymphocyte population and the absolute lymphocyte counts that can be used to defi ne leukemia would be important and clinically useful, but at present no such reports are available in the veterinary literature.",

The use of anti-canine CD34, a marker generally found on precursor lymphocytes, is useful in objectively identi fying cases of acute leukemia. CD34 is most likely expressed on both ALL and AML (Villiers et al., 2006; Workman and Vernau, 2003) , but there are presently no published studies examining the distribution of CD34 on different leukemic subtypes. In addition, because the traditional classifi cation scheme for acute leukemia has relied on cellular morphology alone, the correlation between blast morphology and CD34 expression has not been established. Despite this fact, recent work has documented a signifi cantly shortened survival time in dogs with increased numbers of circulating CD34\u03e9 cells (Williams et al., 2008) . Often when blasts are identifi ed in the peripheral blood or bone marrow it is diffi cult to assign a cell lineage, and fl ow cytometry can be extremely useful in these cases although again, few reports have been published correlating morphologic characteristics with immunophenotype. Cytoplasmic staining of acute leukemias may be more useful than surface staining, because human T-cell ALL express CD3 only in their cytoplasm ( Szczepanski et al., 2006) , and the B cell marker CD79a is located in the cytoplasm. Leukemias staining with either of these markers can generally be classifi ed as lymphoid. Cells staining with surface markers such as CD14 or CD11b are classifi ed as myeloid. Intracellular staining with an antibody to myeloperoxidase or using the antibody MAC387 may provide further confi rmation of the myeloid origin of these cells. There is an excellent study correlating AML subclassifi cation (AML-M1, M4 and M5) with immunophenotype using a variety of markers (Villiers et al., 2006) , but similar studies are not available for ALL.",

Although image analysis has existed for some time, the advent of computer-assisted analysis has led to a more rapid, sensitive, and quantitative method of evaluation (Meijer et al., 1997) . Typically, a television camera receives images from a light microscope. These signals are converted into digits by an interfaced computer, creating digitized cell images that can be displayed on a monitor. Image analysis can be divided into three different areas: for example, cellular morphometry, counting cellular components, and cytometry. Morphometry is the quantitative description of geometric features of cellular structures of any dimension. The counting of cellular components or object counting is usually applied to the assessment of cell kinetics by evaluating proliferative markers in tumors. This allows for the quantitation of the proliferative fraction or number of mitoses in a cell population, which has been shown to be useful for evaluation of the biologic behavior of tumors. Proliferation markers include bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Ki67, and AgNOR method.",

Clonality testing is based on the observation that lymphocytes mount a diverse response to antigens, whether they are derived from the environment (such as allergens), from pathogens, or from self (autoantigens). By contrast, malignant lymphocytes are homogeneous, arising from a single transformed cell. Normal lymphocyte differentiation depends on the process of antigen receptor rearrangement; therefore, all mature lymphocytes have antigen receptor genes that have undergone V-J or V-D-J rearrangement. Immunoglobulin genes are rearranged in B lymphocytes, and T-cell receptor genes \u2423/\u2424 and/or \u2425/\u2426 in T lymphocytes (Jung and Alt, 2004) . During this process (Fig. 17-15 ) nucleotides are trimmed or added between genes as they recombine, resulting in signifi cant length and sequence heterogeneity, particularly within the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3). Further diversity within B-cell immunoglobulin genes is created by somatic hypermutation during antigen-driven B cell activation. The end result of this differentiation is a diverse population of lymphocytes with virtually limitless antigen specifi city and a large variety of CDR3 sequences and lengths. Lymphocytes derived from the same clone will have CDR3 regions of the same length and sequence. The term PARR is used to distinguish it from other types of PCR assays and from other methods of determining clonality. Additional means of determining clonality in human medicine would include the amplifi cation of BCL1-IGH and BCL2-IGH genes, because the chromosomal translocation that brings the BCL and IGH loci together is relatively common in human B cell lymphomas (van Dongen et al., 2003) .",

The presence of a variably sized products suggests a polyclonal population of lymphocytes. For gel electrophoresis to be used, the gels must have the ability to resolve products that are three base pairs different in size (thus agarose gels cannot be used). Alternative methods include heteroduplex analysis , which resolves products by both size and sequence heterogeneity (and thus may provide more resolving power), capillary gel electrophoresis, which separates products by size but is less time consuming, and melt curve analysis (Xu et al., 2002) , which uses Syber Green technology and also relies on both size and sequence heterogeneity. Figure 17 -16 shows PCR products separated by size using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Burnett et al, 2003) . Each case has a positive control (lane 1) to confi rm the presence of DNA. The positive control DNA is amplifi ed with any primers that will give a single product, thereby confi rming the relative quantity and quality of the extracted DNA.

This fi nding indicates that a single clone can evolve into dramatically different morphologic phenotypes. Burnett et al.

Most translocations found in human leukemia and lymphoma involve the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus. For example, the t(11;14) translocation juxtaposes the locus encoding cyclin D1 on chromosome 11 to an immunoglo bulinenhancer sequence on chromosome 14. This translocation, which results in the overexpression of cyclin D1, is found in virtually all cases of mantle cell lymphoma (Campo, 2003) . Detection of the translo cation by PCR or the overexpressed protein by immunohistochemistry can be used to confi rm the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma in histologically ambiguous cases. Recently, a consortium of European researchers found that the combined use of clonality determi nation through antigen receptor rearrangements together with detection of this and other translocations by PCR resulted in detection of a clonal population in 95% of cases of confi rmed lymphoid malignancies (van Krieken et al., 2003) . Chromosomal aberrations have been detected in dogs by conventional karyotyping (Hahn et al., 1994) and by comparative genome hybridization (Thomas et al., 2003) . Aberrations include the gain or loss of portions of chromosomes, as well as balanced translocations between different chromosomes. The assays used to detect these chromosomal changes are not yet amenable to routine diagnostic testing, and may not be suffi ciently sensitive for detecting early malignancy or a small number of malignant cells within a population of reactive cells. Despite this fact, studies of this sort will almost certainly lead to the discovery of targeted PCR and immunohistochemistry or fl ow cytometry-based assays that can be used for detecting malignant lymphocytes in ambiguous cases.",
