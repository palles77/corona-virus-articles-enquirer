The relatively high mortality of FIP, especially for younger cats from catteries and shelters, should be reason enough to stimulate such intense interest. However, it is the complexity of the disease and the grudging manner in which it yields its secrets that most fascinate researchers. Feline leukemia virus infection was conquered in less than two decades and the mysteries of feline immunodeficiency virus were largely unraveled in several years. After a half century, FIP remains one of the last important infections of cats for which we have no single diagnostic test, no vaccine and no definitive explanations for how virus and host interact to cause disease. How can a ubiquitous and largely non-pathogenic enteric coronavirus transform into a highly lethal pathogen? What are the interactions between host and virus that determine both disease form (wet or dry) and outcome (death or resistance)? Why is it so difficult, and perhaps impossible, to develop a vaccine for FIP? What role do genetics play in disease susceptibility? This review will explore research conducted over the last 5 years that attempts to answer these and other questions. Although much has been learned about FIP in the last 5 years, the ultimate answers remain for yet more studies.",

It is uncertain where the first FIP virus (FIPV) came from, but one possibility is that feline coronaviruses originated within the century from another host species. Alternatively, it is possible that contemporary feline coronaviruses are genetic variants of a preexisting and somewhat different virus species that was less prone to undergo biotype conversion. Both scenarios are known to occur with coronaviruses. The intestinal form of coronavirus in pigs has been replaced worldwide by a much less pathogenic pneumotropic strain (Rasschaert et al., 1990) , while several coronaviruses have entered human beings from other mammalian hosts (Chan et al., 2013) .",

The post-war urban and suburban sprawl has greatly increased the numbers of feral and semi-feral (community) cats, and resulted in large numbers of kittens and cats coming into shelters and other foster/rescue organizations. An increasing proportion of our pet cats now come from these types of multicat environments, which can be stressful and favor fecal-oral transmission at a very young age. It should not be surprising that coronaviruses are now the most common pathogen identified in the feces of cats (Sabshin et al., 2012) .",

However, with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), interest in coronaviruses as pathogens has dramatically increased, along with levels of research funding. There are commonalities between what has been learned with animal coronaviruses and these emerging and sometimes fatal human viruses. They are continuously adapting themselves to new hosts, they readily recombine with closely related species to form new viruses, and they even change cell tropisms and virulence within the same host.",

Much more is known about the interaction of enteric and FIP biotypes with their specific and very different host cells, and the radically different host response and clinical outcomes they provoke.

However, like any process involving RNA polymerases, an error rate in the order of 1/10,000 nucleotides is expected. To minimize errors, the large genome encodes a number of non-structural proteins that ensure a higher fidelity of replication (Hagemeijer et al., 2012) . Nonetheless, mutations do occur with some frequency. Chang et al. (2012) compared whole virus sequencing of 11 FIPV-FECV pairs and observed substitutions in at least 2963 nucleotides, representing 10% of the genome. Of these 2963 nucleotides, 1187 occurred in ORF 1ab, 1246 in ORF S (encoding the S glycoprotein), 248 in ORF 3abc, 22 in ORF E (encoding the small envelope protein), 42 in ORF M (encoding the integral membrane protein), 113 in ORF N (encoding the N protein) and 106 in ORF 7ab. Other types of mutations, leading to insertions, deletions and premature stop codons, as well as recombinants, have also been observed in vivo, both within and between hosts (Pedersen et al., , 2012 . Phillips et al. (2013) studied the mutation rate of FIPV strain WSU-79-1146 in vitro after 1, 8 and 50 passages, followed by whole viral genome sequencing at each passage level. They observed 21 predicted amino acid changes in ORF 1a/1b during this period in culture, one predicted change in the S protein (which reverted back after additional passages), four changes in ORF 3c and one each in ORFs 3a, M, N and 7a, and calculated the mutation rate to be 5-6 \u00d7 10 \u22126 nucleotides/site/passage. This suggested that the genome was relatively stable in vitro and in the absence of host and environmental selection pressures.",

Two thirds or more of FIPVs have ORF 3c mutations that lead to a truncated protein product, i.e. nucleotide deletions and insertions leading to frame shifting, and single nucleotide polymorphisms causing premature stop codons Chang et al., 2012; Hsieh et al., 2013) . The one third that do not have truncating mutations have an increased number of nucleotide changes, leading to an accumulation of non-synonymous amino acid changes in the 3' terminus of the gene (Pedersen et al., 2012) . However, only truncating mutations have a known effect on host cell tropism. Two independent studies have confirmed the absolute requirement of an intact ORF 3c for replication of feline coronavirus in the intestinal epithelium (Chang et al., 2012; Pedersen et al., 2012) . FIPVs with truncating ORF 3c mutations will not replicate in the gut epithelium, but will efficiently replicate in macrophages. FIPVs with non-truncating mutations in the 3' terminus of ORF 3c will replicate in the intestine, but they do not appear to be infectious under experimental conditions (Pedersen et al., 2012) .",

A single nucleotide change within the S gene encoding the fusion peptide was present in 124/129 (96%) FIPVs from cats with the wet and dry forms of FIP, but absent from 11 FECVs. A second mutation, two nucleotides away, was also strongly associated with FIPVs. Either or both of these two single base pair mutations were observed in most FIPVs, but not in FECVs. These mutations, designated M1058L and S1060A, caused minor changes in single amino acids within the S protein in FIPVs (i.e. methionine to leucine at position 1058 and serine to alanine at position 1060). The authors postulated that even minor changes in amino acids might be responsible for the increased macrophage tropism of FIPVs. Since these mutations were only observed in FIPVs in diseased tissue and not in virus in feces, it can also be assumed that these particular mutations occur outside the intestine, possibly in monocytes/macrophages. Their role in causing disease is unknown, but they are more likely to be involved in macrophage infectivity than in subsequent host-virus immune interactions.",

Compared to FECVs, all FIPVs had at least one single base mutation in and around the S1/S2 cleavage domain. These mutations were unique to each FIPV and, depending on the number of mutations and exact amino acids that were changed, affected the efficiency of cleavage of the S protein by furin; in most cases, the efficiency was increased, while in some cases it was decreased and in others it remained unchanged. Mutations in the region of the S1/S2 cleavage site were not universal to all FIPVs.

            "text": "Loss of virulence associated with ORF 7b mutations in FIPVs has also led to false assumptions regarding the importance of this ORF in FECV-to-FIPV conversion and the designation of feline coronavirus strain WSU-79-1683 as a prototypic FECV, which was originally based on cat infection studies comparing type II WSU-79-1683, which does not cause FIP, with WSU-79-1146, the prototypic type II FIPV (Pedersen et al., 1984) . The authors concluded that WSU-79-1683 did behave as a FECV. However, this conclusion is counterintuitive, since according to the mutation theory the ORF 7b mutation should have been in WSU-79-1146. Furthermore, WSU-79-1683 grew readily in Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRfk) cells, while the enteric coronavirus could not be cultured from infectious feces in any cell line at the time. Sequencing of WSU-79-1683 also demonstrated a mutated ORF 3c, whereas the ORF 3c of FECVs is always intact (Chang et al., 2010) . These findings led to the conclusion that the WSU-79-1683 strain was not a true FECV (Pedersen, 2009 ). This finding altered the conclusions of many previous studies using WSU-79-1683 and WSU-79-1146 as prototypic FECVs and FIPVs, respectively. Dedeurwaerder et al. (2013a) tried to link ORF 7b with macrophage tropism and hence with the evolution of FIPVs by measuring the replication kinetics of FIPV WSU-79-1146 and several specific deletion mutants in monocyte cultures. The mutants lacked either the ORF 3abc accessory genes (FIPV-\u03943), ORF 7ab (FIPV-\u03947) or both ORF 3abc and ORF 7b (FIPV-\u03943\u03947). Growth of FIPV-\u03947 and FIPV-\u03943\u03947 could not be sustained in monocyte cultures, whereas sustained growth was observed in monocyte cultures infected with intact FIPV WSU-79-1146. FIPV-\u03943 replicated in monocyte cultures, but at a lower level than intact FIPV WSU-79-1146. The authors concluded that ORF 7 is crucial for FIPV replication in monocytes/ macrophages. They also concluded that their findings support the role of ORF 7b in the development of FIP and provide an explanation as to why ORF 7b is almost always conserved in field strains of FIPV. However, they failed to note that ORF 7b is also highly conserved in field strains of FECV Chang et al., 2010) . Therefore, it is true that loss of the integrity of ORF 7b (almost always occurring during cell culture passage) will cause FIPVs to lose virulence, but it is not true that ORF 7b mutations are involved in FECV-to-FIPV transformation.",

The authors identified five non-contiguous amino acids in the M protein of feline coronavirus that differentiated these two types. However, the numbers of cats used to construct the phylogenetic trees were inadequate and the authors failed to consider that many of the cats originated from different geographic regions, thus introducing genetic drift and population bias.",

(2003) generated a mutant of FIPV WSU-79-1146 in which the S gene was replaced by that of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), which allowed recombinant virus to be selected for in murine cells. In a second reverse process, the FIPV S gene was reintroduced to permit growth in feline cells. The growth characteristics of this reverse recombinant virus in tissue culture and its virulence for cats were indistinguishable from that of the parental virus, FIPV WSU-79-1146. This technique was then used to develop an avirulent deletion mutant of FIPV WSU-79-1146 that was assessed as a potential vaccine (Haijema et al., 2004) . Tekes et al. (2008 Tekes et al. ( , 2010 Tekes et al. ( , 2012 ) used a similar reverse genetics technique, but with a replication competent molecular clone of the type I FIPV Black strain, as well as the type II FIPV WSU-79-1146. In their first study, ORF 3abc of FIPV Black was replaced by a green fluorescent protein and luciferase so that the virus could be tracked in CD14 + blood monocytes and dendritic cells (Tekes et al., 2008) . In a subsequent study, Tekes et al. (2010) demonstrated that recombinant feline coronaviruses expressing the type II S protein acquire the ability to efficiently use feline aminopeptidase N for host cell entry, while type I viruses use another host cell receptor. They also noted that the recombinant virus containing the type II S gene produced high levels of large plaque virus identical to wild type FIPV WSU-79-1146. Therefore, both the growth kinetics and the efficient usage of aminopeptidase N as a cellular receptor for type II feline coronaviruses were attributed solely to the S protein.",

Unfortunately, neither control wild type FIPV Black, nor its recombinant, caused FIP. The authors deduced that the mutation(s) responsible for the loss of virulence occurred upon prior tissue culture passage and resided in ORFs 1a, M, N or 7ab, or the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). In contrast, SPF cats infected with wild type FIPV WSU-79-1146 and its replication competent molecular clone exhibited clinical signs starting at 2-3 weeks post infection and one cat in each group had to be euthanased after 7 weeks.

Primary FECV infection is largely subclinical or associated with a transient and usually mild diarrhea and is centered in the lower small intestine and colon (Kipar et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2010) . Large amounts of virus are shed in the feces for many weeks and even months after initial infection, but with time most cats cease shedding. There also appears to be a low level of FECV in blood monocytes during initial infection (Kipar et al., 2010) .

Fecal samples were collected within 24 h after admission in 50 normal cats and 50 cats with diarrhea, and tested by fecal flotation, antigen assays, PCR and electron microscopy for pathogens. Twelve enteric pathogens were identified, including coronavirus, Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A, Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., Cystoisospora spp., hookworms, ascarids, Salmonella spp., astrovirus, feline panleukopenia virus, calicivirus and Spirometra spp. Interestingly, cats with diarrhea were no more likely to be infected with one or more of these enteropathogens than cats with normal feces (84% in both groups). Only FECV was significantly more prevalent in cats with diarrhea than in normal cats (58% and 36%, respectively). FECV was also the most common fecal pathogen, being several times more common than any other enteric pathogen studied.",

This cell line readily propagated two strains of type I FECVs, while no infection was seen in cultures inoculated with FIPV tissue homogenates. The fact that FIPVs would not grow in this cell line supports the theory that FIPVs lose tropism for the intestinal epithelium and that FECV is the main biotype circulating among cats.

Type I FECVs/FIPVs are unique to cats, while type II FECVs/FIPVs appear to be recombinants between type I FECVs and the closely related canine coronaviruses. Serologic differences are due to canine coronavirus S protein sequences encoded by the ORF 3a and S gene regions . Type I FECVs/FIPVs predominate in Europe and the Americas, while up to 25% or more feline coronaviruses from Asian countries are type II (Sharif et al., 2010; An et al., 2011; Amer et al., 2012) . The exact origin of type II feline coronaviruses is unknown, but their genetic variability suggests that they are continuously being generated. The independent nature of these recombination events is indicated by the varying genetic makeup of the 'hybrid' viruses. These recombination events are often highly complex. This is demonstrated by strains such as NTU156 from Taiwan (Lin et al., 2013) . This strain not only contains an in-frame deletion of 442 nucleotides in ORF 3c, a mutation associated with the FECV-to-FIPV biotype change, but also two crossover events with recombination sites located in the RNAdependent RNA polymerase and M genes. This produced a new virus with one-third of its genome originating from canine coronavirus. Although not proven, it is widely assumed that type II FIPVs are more virulent than type I FIPVs (Lin et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) , possibly associated with the ease with which they are propagated in a number of cat and dog cell lines. Type II FIPVs might also be more likely to be transmitted between cats and to be associated with outbreaks of FIP, such as one described in a Taiwanese shelter .",

There is no solid evidence that cats with FIP readily transmit FIPV directly to other cats, although the possibility has been suggested as an explanation for rare mini-outbreaks of FIP (Pedersen, 2009 ). FIPV can cause disease when fed to laboratory cats, and some experimentally infected cats will shed low levels of FIPV-like virus (Pedersen et al., , 2012 . However, such virus does not appear to be infectious when fed to other cats (Pedersen et al., 2012) . Some cats with naturally acquired FIP can also shed either FECV or a coronavirus that appears genetically similar to the FIPV within the same cats (Chang et al., 2010 ). An outbreak of FIP in Taiwan associated with a type II FIPV appeared to be transmissible, but was self-limiting, either due to quarantine measures or more likely to genetic drift . Sequential samples collected over time from this outbreak documented the replacement of the original virus, which had an intact ORF 3c, with viruses having functionally mutated ORF 3c. This provided indirect evidence that ORF 3c mutations are more likely to be associated with disease than with infectivity.",

The working hypothesis is that FECVs mutate in a manner that causes them to lose tropism for enterocytes, while gaining tropism for macrophages. The exact site where these mutations occur is unknown, but it is apparently at some point between the intestine (enterocyte) and FIP lesions (macrophage). A possible intermediate site for this transformation would be blood monocytes/macrophages, which are known to be infected during FECV infection (Kipar et al., 2010) . FECV-to-FIPV transition appears to involve positive selection for mutants that are increasingly fit for replication in macrophages and unfit for replication in enterocytes. The ultimate target cell is not just any macrophage, but rather a distinct population of precursor monocytes/ macrophages that have a specific affinity for the endothelium of venules in the serosa, omentum, pleura, meninges and uveal tract.",

Antibodies enhance the uptake and replication of FIPVs in macrophages and also contribute to a type III hypersensitivity (antibody-mediated or Arthus-type) vasculitis (Pedersen, 2009) . It is also assumed that much of the pathology occurring in FIP is associated with how macrophages respond to viral infection and how the immune system of the host responds to the infected cells. In this scenario, the effusive form of FIP results from a failure to mount T cell immunity in the face of a vigorous B cell response. At the opposite extreme, cats that resist disease presumably mount a vigorous cell-mediated immune response that is able to overcome any negative effects of antibodies. Cats with the dry form of FIP represent an intermediate state involving a cellular response that is partially effective in containing the virus to a relatively small number of macrophages in a few focal sites within specific target organs. The two forms of FIP are somewhat interchangeable; when it has been observed in experimental infection, the dry form always follows a brief bout of effusive disease. In the terminal stages of naturally occurring dry FIP, immunity can completely collapse and the disease reverts to a more effusive form. Although this scenario fits what is known about FIP, it must be emphasized that much of this scheme awaits confirmation and there are large gaps to be filled.",

One study demonstrated that the ratio of peripheral blood surface immunoglobulin positive cells (sIg + ) to CD21+ cells was higher in cats with FIP than in SPF cats, and that cells strongly expressing mRNA of the plasma cell master gene encoding B lymphocyteinduced maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1) were increased (Takano et al., 2009a) . The mRNAs of interleukin 6, CD40 and B cell activating factor (BAFF) were also overexpressed in macrophages previously shown to be associated with antibody-dependent enhancement. Vermeulen et al. (2013) studied the role of natural killer (NK) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the innate and adaptive cellmediated immunity, respectively, in cats with naturally occurring FIP. NK cells and Tregs were drastically depleted from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen in cats with FIP, while the mesentery and kidneys from cats with FIP did not show any differences when compared to healthy uninfected control cats. Other regulatory lymphocytes of the CD4 + CD25 \u2212 Foxp3 + and CD3 + CD8 + Foxp3 + phenotypes were depleted from both blood and lymph nodes. NK cells in cats with FIP were upregulated for the activation markers CD16 and CD25, and migration markers CD11b and CD62L, while NK cells from lymph nodes had upregulation of CD16 and CD62L only. NK cells from the lymph nodes of cats with FIP also exhibited less cytotoxic activity than NK cells from the lymph nodes of healthy cats. Therefore, it appears that infection with FIPV is associated with severe depletion of both NK cells and Tregs, and reduced NK cell function. This could reduce the capacity of the innate immune system to attack the virus and to suppress the associated immunologic and inflammatory responses.",

This prompted additional comparative studies of enterotropic and polytropic strains of MHV (Compton et al., 2004) . Immunocompetent, as well as B and T cell deficient strains of laboratory mice were infected with an enterotropic strain of MHV, MHV-Y. The infection in immunocompetent mice was limited to the small intestine for the first week and then to the cecum and colon for the next 2 weeks. B cell deficient mice also developed chronic subclinical infection restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, but lasting for 7-8 weeks. The pattern of infection in these two strains of mice was reminiscent of FECV infection in laboratory cats (Pedersen et al., 2008; Kipar et al., 2010) . In contrast, T cell deficient mice infected with MHV-Y developed a multi-systemic lethal infection, with virus detected in the intestine during the first week; the mice then developed peritonitis by week 2, with virus detected in mesentery and visceral peritoneum, before the mice died by weeks 3-4. These findings with MHV strains in inbred strains of mice support the importance of both IFN-\u03b3 and T cell immunity in resistance to FIP. In the mouse model, it was the host's response to MHV and not the biotype that determined the disease form (enteritis or FIP-like disease), while in the case of FIP, genetic differences between the FECV and FIPV biotypes determine the host response and disease form (enteritis or FIP).",

These cells arrive from the bloodstream as a result of upregulation of both adhesion proteins and their receptors. Olyslaegers et al. (2013) studied the altered expression of the transmigration adhesion molecules CD11a, CD11b, CD15s, CD18, CD49d and CD54 on blood leukocytes from cats with naturally occurring FIP.

The factors responsible for this outpouring of fluid have not been identified fully, but at least one of these factors appears to be vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; Takano et al., 2011a) . This is produced by FIPV infected monocytes and macrophages. Other proteins, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, granulocyte macrophagecolony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are also produced by macrophages in cats with FIP and are thought to contribute to increased survival of neutrophils (Takano et al., 2009b) . The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been shown to play an important role in the over production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in FIPV infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Regan et al., 2009) .",

The sequences used were obtained from an earlier study by Battilani et al. (2010) that compared a small number of N gene sequences from lesions of cats with FIP and feces of clinically healthy cats, and purported to show N epitopes that would differentiate the two. The test was applied to a group of healthy cats and another group with chronic diseases other than FIP. Cats with chronic diseases other than FIP responded with increases in both IFN-\u03b3 protein and mRNA when exposed to peptides that were presumed to be specific for avirulent (FECV) or a mixture of avirulent (FECV) and virulent (FIPV) epitopes. Unfortunately, no results were given for cats with FIP. Satoh et al. (2011a) developed monoclonal antibodies against feline IFN-\u03b3 and used them to study immune responses to FIPV. PBMCs from cats experimentally infected with FIPV that did not develop clinical disease had significantly increased levels of IFN-\u03b3 production after exposure to heat-inactivated FIPV compared to cats that died of FIP; the increased IFN-\u03b3 levels were more marked in CD8 + than CD4 + T cells. It was concluded that cell-mediated immunity was important in resistance to FIP. Dedeurwaerder et al. (2013b) studied the role of the ORF 7a gene product in antiviral defense. Deletion of ORF 7a and ORF 7b of FIPV WSU-79-1146 rendered the virus more susceptible to IFN-\u03b1 treatment in cell culture. They then separately added ORF 7a and ORF 7b back into the mutant virus; ORF 7a, but not ORF 7b, rescued normal sensitivity to IFN-\u03b1. When these insertions were performed in a mutant of FIPV WSU-79-1146 with deletions of ORF 3abc and ORF 7ab, sensitivity to IFN-\u03b1 was not restored. It was concluded that the ORF 7a protein acted as a type I IFN antagonist in the presence of ORF 3abc protein(s) and protected FIPV against the effects of this particular host cell antiviral response.",

Harun et al. (2013) demonstrated the feasibility of such an approach using CRfk cells exposed to FIPV WSU-79-1146 for 3 h. They were able to detect 18,899 of the 19,046 annotated feline genes. Based on results from their culture studies and Kal's Z test, 44 genes were upregulated, 61 genes were not affected by virus infection and the remaining genes were down-regulated. This transcriptional profile was used to identify three genes (A3H, PD-1 and PD-L1) that were both upregulated and potentially relevant to FIP. A real-time (RT)-PCR was than developed for each gene, and the level of expression in PBMCs from seven cats with confirmed FIP was measured. Upregulation of cDNAs from the three genes was observed, but it tended to be low and highly variable between individual genes, as well as cats. Although this study did not report details on the number of replicates used in various parts of the study, and could have used actual normal and diseased tissues/ cells in preference to experimentally infected and non-infected CRfk cells, it is an approach that will be applied much more in the future.",

(2011b) synthesized 81 peptides from the S2 region of the S protein of a type I FIPV (KU-2) and type II FIPV (WSU-79-1146), and from the N protein of FIPV KU-2. They used these peptides to stimulate IFN-\u03b3 production from PBMCs of cats experimentally infected with FIPV and identified a number of linear immunodominant antibody-binding epitopes at different positions in the S2 and N regions within both type I and type II FIPVs. Satoh et al. (2010) also studied three baculovirus expressed proteins derived from different regions of the S2 domain of the S protein of the type I FIPV KU-2 strain. One of these proteins, which spanned the region from the fusion peptide to the heptad repeat 2 region, induced a vigorous T helper type 1 (Th1) and T helper type 2 (Th2) immune response in mice. Out of 30 peptides derived from this region that were tested in mice, four peptides that included both Th1 and Th2 epitopes were identified; the authors concluded that these regions should be explored in cats as potential immunogens. Takano et al. (2011b) also studied the putative ADE epitopes in FIPV WSU-79-1146 with a battery of monoclonal antibodies against the virus neutralizing epitope on the S protein. Virus cultures exposed to one of these monoclonal antibodies eventually yielded a virus with two amino acid changes in the neutralizing epitope of the S protein that rendered it resistant to neutralization. In the process, the monoclonal antibody used to produce this mutant also lost its ability to enhance the replication of homologous virus, thus suggesting that virus neutralization and ADE were present in the same region of the S protein. The mutant virus used in the study also replicated to lower levels in monocyte/macrophages.",

In doing so, the infected monocytes can escape antibody-dependent cell lysis. In a subsequent study, Dewerchin et al. (2014) identified kinases and cytoskeletal proteins that were involved in internalization and subsequent intracellular transport of FIPV. Myosin light chain kinase and myosin 1 were crucial for the initiation of the internalization process, as shown by the co-localization of both proteins with antigens prior to virus internalization. One minute after internalization commenced, the virus-laden vesicles had colocalized with microtubules and accumulated at the microtubule organizing center after 10-30 min. This activity of myosin light chain kinase was effectively inhibited by ML-7, thus identifying a possible target for an anti-viral drug.",

Several reportedly showed protection, but only one of doubtful efficacy went into commercial production. However, recently there has been a renewed interest in FIP vaccines. B\u00e1lint et al. (2013) developed a vaccine based on a pair of recombinant viruses derived from the type II FIPV strain DF2, a virus nearly identical to FIPV WSU-79-1146. One strain was avirulent and the other of low virulence. SPF cats appeared to be fully protected against virulent FIPV DF2 after two oronasal and two intramuscular injections 2 weeks apart. Surprisingly, purebred British shorthair cats were not protected following the same vaccine regimen, although experimental and control groups were small. Vaccination with the avirulent virus induced ADE and, following challenge-exposure, all cats developed FIP; 40% of cats had prolonged survival, while 60% died from fulminant disease. The researchers evoked differences between conventional and SPF cats, as well as heterologous virus pre-exposure, as reasons for the various experimental outcomes. Takano et al. (2014a) immunized cats with Th1 stimulating peptides identified previously in the N protein of the type I FIPV strain KU-2 using feline CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (fCpG-ODNs) as adjuvants. Some immunity was demonstrated against challengeexposure with the type II FIPV strain WSU-79-1146, but immune tolerance was also observed at higher vaccine dosages. The researchers concluded that further investigations on the combination and concentrations of the peptides and fCpG-ODNs, along with dose, frequency and route of administration, were needed. Takano et al. (2014b) identified strong Th1 epitopes within the S1 domain of the S protein and in the M protein of both type I (KU-2) and type II (WSU-79-1146) FIPVs. Interestingly, no immunodominant antibody binding Th1 epitope-containing peptide was identified in the primary antibody binding S1 domain of the type II FIPV. Eleven Th1 epitope-containing peptides were identified in the S, M and N proteins that were common to both type I and type II FIPVs. Three of these peptides were administered with CpG-ODNs to SPF cats; two of these peptides from the S1 and M proteins induced Th1 activity to peptide stimulation of PBMC cultures, but no cat infection results were reported.",

A genome-wide association study of a relatively large number of Birman cats identified five regions on four different chromosomes that could harbor genes involved in susceptibility (Golovko et al., 2013) . Five candidate genes (ELMO1, RRAGA, TNSF10, ERAP1 and ERAP2) were identified in these four regions; all are associated with processes relevant to FIP, such as cellular migration, phagocytosis, apoptosis and virus-host interactions. These associations require confirmation and further study, as they might only be relevant to one breed. If genetics are involved in the disease, as it appears, the exact genes and pathways involved appear to be numerous and, therefore, inheritance is likely to be complex.",

            "text": "We are rapidly gaining a better understanding of the mutational events that cause FECVs to become FIPVs, but we lack knowledge of how these mutations are involved in immunopathogenesis. At least three separate types of mutations have been associated with the acquisition of FIP virulence and more are likely to be discovered. Cell lines that will replicate FECVs in vitro have been developed and this, coupled with the creation of infectious molecular clones of FIPV, will hopefully allow us to assess the importance of these and any future mutations. A number of new reagents and procedures have given us a window into the cells involved in the inflammatory and immune responses that characterize the two distinct, yet overlapping, clinical forms of FIP. Other environmental and host factors undoubtedly play a role in determining the outcome of exposure, but their roles are not understood. The elaboration of various cytokines and other inflammatory proteins in the FIP disease process has been extensively studied, but how these various factors are stimulated and their role in pathology is poorly understood. A possible role for genetic susceptibility has been identified in at least one breed of cats, but the genetics appear to be highly complex and cannot explain the entire disease incidence. A more parsimonious conclusion is that FIP results from a confluence of numerous viral, host and environmental factors akin to the 'perfect storm'. Although we are heartened by our increasing knowledge of this disease, we are continually reminded of the words of Robert Frost in his poem 'The Secret Sits': 'We dance round in a ring and suppose, but the secret sits in the middle and knows.'",
