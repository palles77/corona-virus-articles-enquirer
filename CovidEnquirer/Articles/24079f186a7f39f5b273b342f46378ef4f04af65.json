Detection of tuberculosis had stagnated at around 30% of the estimated total of new cases, and multidrugresistant tuberculosis was a major problem. These signs of inadequate tuberculosis control can be linked to a malfunctioning health system. The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, brought to light substantial weaknesses in the country's public-health system. After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the government increased its commitment and leadership to tackle public-health problems and, among other eff orts, increased public-health funding, revised laws that concerned the control of infectious diseases, implemented the world's largest internet-based disease reporting system, and started a programme to rebuild local public-health facilities. These measures contributed to acceleration in eff orts to control tuberculosis. By 2005, the detection of cases of tuberculosis had increased to 80% of the estimated total new cases, permitting China to achieve the 2005 global tuberculosis control targets. At the same time, specifi c eff orts to improve tuberculosis control also contributed to strengthening of the public-health system. We examine how the strengthening of a disease control programme and the public-health system worked together to achieve a desired health outcome.",

On the basis of national surveys in 1979 and 1990, the prevalence of tuberculosis fell by an average of 3\u00b73% every year during the 1980s. 3 In the 1990s, the government implemented two major tuberculosis control projects as part of its 10-year plan to control tuberculosis.

Nearly 1\u00b75 million cases of smear-positive tuberculosis were diagnosed and cured. 4 A large cadre of health-care workers was trained in the fundamental elements of DOTS, fi rmly establishing these methods as the national strategy for tuberculosis control. Most importantly, on the basis of results from the 2000 national tuberculosis prevalence survey, there was a 36% reduction in disease prevalence between 1990 and 2000 in the half of China that implemented the project. 5 Despite these achievements, there were signs of diffi culties elsewhere in the country's tuberculosis control programme. In the half of China that did not implement the project funded by the World Bank, the prevalence of tuberculosis did not fall during the 1990s. 5 Thus, the fall in tuberculosis prevalence for the entire country slowed to 2\u00b75% per year during the 1990s. The 2000 national tuberculosis prevalence survey revealed that one in ten patients with tuberculosis had multidrugresistant (MDR) disease-ie, resistant to both isoniazid and rifampicin. 5 Other studies confi rmed a serious epidemic of MDR tuberculosis in several Chinese provinces, with rates of multidrug resistance in previously untreated cases that were fi ve to ten times higher than the global median. 6, 7 The inadequate control of tuberculosis can be linked to a malfunctioning health system. From 1978 to 2002, the government's share of total health expenditure fell from 32% to 16%. 8 This reduction forced many Chinese healthcare facilities and providers to focus on the generation of revenue, with little concern for public health. Hospitals and clinics essentially functioned (and continue to function) as for-profi t entities. 9 In 2000, nearly 90% of patients with tuberculosis initiated their diagnostic and treatment process in hospitals and non-public healthcare facilities, where they were given tests and drugs as long as they could pay. 5 Many patients who improved or ran out of money discontinued treatment. Thus, only 20% of patients with tuberculosis treated outside the public-health system took their tuberculosis medications regularly in 2000. 5 Such irregular treatment breeds drugresistant tuberculosis.",

In terms of policy, the national tuberculosis control programme has clear targets and welldefi ned technical policies based on the DOTS strategy. National and international partners work in a cohesive manner toward the same targets, with the same implementation framework. Other public-health programmes are learning from this successful model. In fi nancial terms, funding from diff erent partners is harmonised under one fi nancing plan with clear funding needs and gaps-another model for other programmes. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past-when tuberculosis services were not free-and the success in tuberculosis control over the past few yearswhen tuberculosis services have been free-have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS-eg, directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs-are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programmes. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for them. In terms of information systems, the tuberculosis programme's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programmes. With the new internet-based reporting system for communicable diseases, the tuberculosis programme leads the way in the use of information to improve public-health outcomes. Finally, the model of collaboration between hospitals and CDC facilities provided by the tuberculosis control programme is one of the best examples to date of how hospitals should be involved in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has infl uenced the development of new policies that involve hospitals in the work of public health.",

More important are the targets of halving the prevalence of, and mortality from, tuberculosis. Countries in the Western Pacifi c region committed to these targets in 1999, as did the wider international community as part of the MDGs. 15, 16 To achieve these targets, China needs to address existing challenges to its eff orts to control tuberculosis. Foremost is the serious epidemic of MDR tuberculosis. WHO estimates that a third of the world's cases of MDR tuberculosis are in China, even though the country has only 15% of the global burden of tuberculosis. 17 The recent expansion of DOTS should help to limit the development of MDR tuberculosis. But reduction of the existing burden of multidrug resistance will take time, especially since poor-quality DOTS services in some areas and inappropriate treatment of tuberculosis in parts of the hospital system continue to generate new cases of MDR tuberculosis.",

Although China has a policy of free tuberculosis services, in most places these are available only to permanent residents in a particular community.

These vulnerable, pre dominantly young migrants-now numbering more than 150 million-tend to live and work in crowded environments and are unlikely to seek medical care when they become ill. Such individuals contribute to the spread of tuberculosis, HIV infection, and other infectious diseases within urban centres. The growing epidemic of co-infection with tuberculosis and HIV if left unchecked will substantially increase the number of tuberculosis cases and deaths. 18 A further diffi culty is presented by the shortage of trained health-care workers for tuberculosis control. CDC facilities are being rebuilt across the country but many are staff ed inadequately or by poorly trained and unmotivated health-care workers. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the challenge of sustaining and further increasing long-term governmental commitment to the control of tuberculosis, which is essential to tackle the other challenges.",

Finally, the government should provide operational costs for public-health services and full salaries for health-care workers, especially at and below the county level, where most of the rural population live. 25 The number of staff needed for essential publichealth functions should be carefully calculated, and publichealth workers must be given fair pay.
