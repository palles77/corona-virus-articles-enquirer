The isolated viruses grew to equal or higher titers than parental JHM virus at 39\" but were restricted in replication at 32\" and hence were cold-sensitive mutants. Neither isolate synthesized RNA at the nonpermissive temperature (32\"), and temperature shift experiments indicated that the restrictive cold-sensitive step in replication occurred during an early viral function. The isolates were unable to complement each other at 32\". Although coinfection between each mutant and parental JHM virus often resulted in decreased yields of both infecting viruses, interference could not be convincingly demonstrated. Both mutants were more thermostable than parental JHM virus and could be distinguished from each other and from parental JHM virus by their thermal inactivation kinetics. The isolates were obtained from single cell clones and therefore presumed to be homogeneous; however, thermal inactivation of one (S-3JHM) indicated the possible existence of a second population. Subclones of virus prepared from each isolate were also found to be thermally stable and to retain the cold sensitive defect. No indication of a second ~pulation of S-3JHM virus was detected.",

Persistent viral infections have been implicated in such human diseases of the central nervous system as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and multiple sclerosis (Johnson and Herndon, 1974; ter Meulen et al., 1970; Weiner and Narayan, 1974) . Infection of mice with the neurotropic JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, represents an animal model of a persistent, Ural-induced demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Although demyelination occurs during the acute infection (Weiner, 1973) , of greater interest is the mechanism by which JHM virus establishes a latent infection whose hallmark is chronic and recurrent myelin loss (Herndon et al., 1975) .",

These chronically infected cells were studied to detect possible changes in the virus population which could be related to the ability of JHM virus to persist in vitro and in viva. By several criteria, the ~feetious virus released by the chronically infected cells was indistinguishable from parental virus. Maintenance of the infection did not appear to be due to the selection of tem~~t~~sensitive (ts) mutants or to the production of detective interfering particles or interferon. Infectious virus, viraf cell surface antigen, and c~opathic effect (CPE) were lost from chronically infected cells after passage in the presence of antiviral antibody although intracellular viral antigen persisted. No release of infectious virus was detected after removal of the antiviral antibody. After cloning chronically infected neuroblastoma cells in the presence of antiviral antibody, some clones retained viral antigen in the cellular cytoplasm while others did not. No i~ectious virus could be induced in any of the cell clones by a variety of chemical or physical treatments or by cocultivation with cells susceptible to JHM virus . Virus was recovered following the fusion of clones derived from single cells to permissive cells by polyethylene glycol (Weiner and Stohhnan, 1978) .

Supernatant virus was removed from culture at the time of each shift and again from the same culture at 12 hr postinfection when the experiment was terminated, A normal yield of JHM virus was obtained after all temperature shifts (data not shown). Although not completely restricted at the non~~ive temperature (32\"C), es 11 replication was suppressed when cultures were shifted to 32\" before 6 hr. The amount of virus found at 12 hr in cultures shifted at 6 hr probably reflects synthesis of new virus at the permissive temperature since it is evident from the data in Fig. 3 that little virus is released in cultures held 6 hr at 32\". When shifted from the nonpe~issive (32\") to the permissive (39\") tem~rature, the replication of ~811 virus was not inhibited in cultures shifted at 1, 2, or 4 hr postinfection (Fig. 3) . However, replication was suppressed in cultures transferred after 4 hr. The titers obtained from the cultures shifted at 8 and 10 hr postinfection indicate that by 8 hr some virus replication could take place, By 10 hr postinfection, the yield of virus was less than the yield obtained from cultures shifted at 8 hr post~fection, indicating that the block in replication must be early since no new virus could be synthesized during this period. We interpret the drop in virus titer occurring between the & and lo-hr shift points to reflect inactivation or reabsorption in the absence of new virus synthesis. Similar data were obtained with S-3JHM virus (data not shown), and the yields of JHM virus were not affected by the temperature shifts.",

To determine if S-1JHM virus and S3JHM virus would interfere with the parent JHM virus, DBT cell cultures were eoinfected with either cs mutants csll or es31 and a large plaque variant of JHM virus (Lai and Stohlman, 1978) .

Coinfected cultures were incubated at the restrictive temperature, and virus was harvested at two time points in separate experiments so different ratios of released es mutant to parental virus could be compared. The virus released from each of five individual plates was titrated. Coinfection resulted in slight but not significant decreases in the yields of both mutant and parental virus at the nonpermissive temperature. A fourfold decrease was found in the yield of es31 from cultures coinfeeted with parental virus while only a twofold decrease in parental virus was found. Similar experiments carried out at 39\" could not be interpreted because an overabundance of es mutant plaques obscured the larger JHM virus plaques.",

It is now apparent that the culture also contained at least two populations of cells which were latently infected with cs mutants of JHM virus. The viruses rescued by cell fusion have the same host cell range as JHM virus, produce CPE identical to that produced by the parent JHM virus, and were serologically indistin~shable from JHM virus (Stohlman et al., 1979) . We have previously shown that JHM virus shows no growth-related temperature sensitivity over the range of 32 to 39\" , and since the isolates are restricted at 32\", we have designated them as es mutants. In addition to being cs mutants, both were also more thermally stable than the parent virus.

Furthermore, the cells need not express detectable viral antigen or contain complete virions or viral subunits demonstrable at the ultramicroscopic level to contain a viral genome capable of being rescued in the form of infectious virus. Although previous studies of latently infected cells selected by antiviral antibody treatment suggested that the viral genome is propagated by cell division (Rustigian, 1966) , we are unable to define a mechanism by which the JHM viral genome replicates and is passaged to the daughter cells. It would appear, however, that JHM virus gene expression can be suppressed at least at two points since one cell clone had detectable viral antigen while the other clone did not. In addition, a complete, albeit altered, genome was present in both cell clones since fusion to permissive cells effected the rescue of infectious virus. Although it may be premature to speculate on the nature of the es defect, it is possible that it resides in a viral-specific RNA polymerase. No polymerase activity has yet been reported in MHV-infected cells, it seems; however, reasonable that this would represent one function expressed prior to the initiation of RNA synthesis.",
