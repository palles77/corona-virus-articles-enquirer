Clinical signs often are vague and insidious. Advanced imaging techniques have improved diagnostic capabilities and recognition of new disorders. Infectious inflammatory disease is the most common categorical differential diagnosis in cats with spinal cord dysfunction. Other common disease categories include neoplasms, trauma, and degenerative disorders. 1 Veterinarians must think beyond the more common differential diagnoses to consider unusual diseases and different diagnostic approaches. This chapter emphasizes newly recognized spinal cord diseases and provides a review of the current literature.",

            "text": "About one third of cats with FIP have presenting clinical signs of neurological dysfunction. 12 Young, purebred, sexually intact male cats are at a higher risk for developing FIP. 13 A genetic susceptibility of about 50 per cent exists for development of FIP. 10 All cats in one study of patients with neurological signs of FIP were from multiple-cat households. 9 Although younger cats are most susceptible to FIP infection, cats of any age can develop the disease. In a case series of cats with spinal cord-related signs, more than 75 per cent were younger than 2 years of age. 1 Most cats with FIP have intracranial signs but often manifest signs of spinal cord dysfunction: pelvic limb ataxia, generalized ataxia, and paraspinal hyperesthesia. In a small case series of cats with confirmed FIP, four of 10 had paresis or paralysis as the presenting clinical sign. 12 Paresis was evident in two of seven of these cats with diffuse FIP. 12 In another study, 28 of 29 cats with FIP had histological lesions that predominated in the cervical spinal cord and brain. 1 Diagnosis. Antemortem diagnosis of FIP is difficult. Diagnosis is suspected based on assimilation of history, signalment, hematology, and other supportive diagnostic tests that include serology, CSF analysis, findings on imaging, and tissue biopsies. A typical history includes acquisition of the cat from a cattery or shelter, and a fever that waxes and wanes and does not improve with antibiotic therapy. 10 Common hematological and biochemistry abnormalities include neutrophilia or lym- phopenia, low albumin with increased globulins, or a high serum fibrinogen. 10 Serological testing and polymerase chain reaction studies to assess for viral load can be beneficial. 10 Serology only confirms exposure to feline coronavirus. Some cats with FIP may have high antibody titers, but this is not absolute. A recent study of histopathologically confirmed cases of FIP found that serological testing provided further support for tissue biopsy procedures. 14 High antibody titers (1:1600) provide a 94 per cent probability of active FIP infection. 14 A titer that was positive but below 1:1600 suggested only a 44 per cent probability that cats had FIP. 14 The titers in 10 per cent of cats with FIP were negative, which suggests a compromised immune system. 14 Definitive diagnosis of FIP is made by histopathology of abdominal organs obtained by tissue biopsy. Immunofluorescent assay/immunohistochemistry techniques can detect presence of coronavirus antigens within macrophages. 14 Diagnostic evaluation of the CNS aids in an indirect diagnosis of FIP. Results of CSF analysis often reveal a marked increase in protein concentration and a neutrophilic pleocytosis. 11, 15 Comparisons of antibodies in serum and CSF may provide additional information, but false negatives and false positives are possible. Presence of antibodies in CSF must be interpreted in light of blood-brain barrier breakdown. Adjunctive comparison of other infectious disease antibody titers in serum and CSF can assist with determination of intrathecal production of antibodies. 10 Common abnormalities on MRI and CT include presence of hydrocephalus and periventricular contrast enhancement. Overall the most consistent diagnostic findings in cats with the CNS form of FIP include a positive coronavirus IgG titer in CSF, a high serum total protein concentration, and abnormalities in brain imaging. 9 Treatment. No treatment has been proven effective for FIP, and the long-term prognosis is poor. 10 Overall mortality rate is 95 per cent. 10 Supportive therapies consist of antiinflammatory doses of prednisone (1 mg/kg/day PO) and immunomodulation with cyclophosphamide or interferon. A recent report found use of recombinant feline interferon combined with corticosteroids more effective in cats with the effusive form than with the noneffusive form (n = 1) of FIP. 16 Other therapeutic recommendations include a diet with high nutritional value and stress reduction. 10",

            "text": "Presenting Signs and Pathogenesis. Cryptococcus neoformans is a saprophytic fungal organism that can cause systemic or focal disease. Transmission occurs through inhalation of the organism that lives in the soil or bird excrements. CNS signs are reflective of meningitis or focal granuloma formation within the brain parenchyma. Fungal masses within the extradural space cause secondary compression ( Figure 51 -2). 17 Cryptococcal infection can cause focal spinal cord disease in some cats. The mean age for cats infected with Cryptococcus is 6 years; however, the age range can vary. 18, 19 Approximately 58 per cent of cats diagnosed with Cryptococcus spp. were considered primarily outdoor cats. 18 Systemic signs are variable and commonly include depression/lethargy, fever, poor body condition, or anorexia. 18 In one case series, approximately 50 per cent of the cats with cryptococcosis had CNS signs, 42 per cent had ocular signs, and 32 per cent had respiratory signs. 18 Cutaneous lesions also can occur. Another case series reported that only 9 per cent of cats showed signs of neurological dysfunction. In this series, nasal signs were more common. 19 Clinical signs of spinal cord dysfunction, including paraspinal hyperesthesia and paresis, have been reported in at least one case series. 18 C. neoformans accounted for 9 per cent of infectious causes of spinal cord disease in cats. 1 Diagnosis. CSF analysis is one of the most useful diagnostic tests in cats with CNS cryptococcosis. Neutrophilic and eosinophilic pleocytosis often are present. In some cases, the organism is identified. Diagnosis also is based on detection of capsular antigen using a latex agglutination test in serum and CSF. Cats with focal granulomas in the CNS may have negative antigen titers. 17 Latex agglutination tests can have falsenegative results (or interference), which makes definitive diagnosis difficult. 18 In these cases, cultures, cytology, or histopathology of other tissues, such as skin, may be necessary. Also important is documentation of the FeLV and FIV status of cats with cryptococcosis, because concurrent infection may be common. 18 Additionally, cats with other concurrent viral infections tend to have a higher incidence of treatment failure. 20 Treatment. Treatment of CNS cryptococcosis consists of long-term administration of systemic antifungal agents. Itraconazole and fluconazole are considered the drugs of choice. Fluconazole (5 to 15 mg/kg PO q12h) is recommended, because it crosses the blood-brain barrier readily and has high lipid solubility. Duration of treatment ranges from 6 to 10 months; however, a longer duration may be required to prevent relapse. 21, 22 Antiinflammatory doses of corticosteroids help to decrease the inflammation and edema that can worsen neurological signs during treatment. Therapeutic monitoring is based on clinical response and serial serum antigen titers. Antigen titers often remain positive for a considerable period of time after clinical signs have resolved. 19 Cats that have a reduction in antigen titer during the course of treatment have a better prognosis. 20 Surgical removal of a fungal granuloma may be considered in conjunction with antifungal therapy. 17",

Airway is assessed for patency and adequate ventilation. Appropriate fluid therapy helps to maintain cardiovascular function. Aggressive fluid therapy is important to maintain spinal cord perfusion. 49 Hypotension is one factor shown to worsen outcome in human beings with spinal cord injury. Isotonic crystalloids (lactated Ringer's solution or 0.9 per cent sodium chloride) at shock doses, initially (60 ml/kg/hr IV in cats) are given to effect until heart rate, capillary refill time, and pulse quality improve. Hetastarch (6 per cent) is a large molecular weight colloid that consists of a branched polysaccharide, amylopectin. Its molecular properties provide a long intravascular half-life. The dose is 10 to 20 ml/kg given to effect up to 40 ml/kg/hr. Hetastarch is administered intravenously to cats to effect up to 10 to 15 ml/kg; the dose is increased in 5 ml/kg increments every 5 to 10 minutes to avoid nausea and vomiting. Hypertonic saline (7 per cent) also may be used to expand blood volume quickly. The dose (4 to 5 ml/kg) is administered as an intravenous bolus over 3 to 5 minutes. The disadvantage associated with the use of hypertonic saline is that it remains in the vascular space for only 15 to 60 minutes. Blood products also are used to expand volume and provide increased oxygen delivery. Whole blood is administered intravenously at a dose of 4 to 10 ml/kg/hr, over 4 to 6 hours in stable patients and faster in unstable patients.

The intent of high-dose MPSS is to provide adequate tissue concentrations of steroid at the site of injury. The original dose for this regimen was 30 mg/kg IV initially, then a dose of 15 mg/kg given 2 and 6 hours later, followed immediately by a 2.5 mg/kg/hr infusion, which is continued for 42 hours.

Spinal stapling involves the use of rigid intramedullary pins that are secured to the spine after reduction of the fracture/luxation. Intramedullary pins are secured to the lamina at the base of the spinous process (Figure 51-4) . 62 Spinal stapling is considered technically easier to perform than other described forms of internal stabilization. Limited information is available for the long-term outcome. Problems associated with this type of surgery include fragility of the spinous processes and migration or breakdown of implants. 45 A recent case series involving 16 cats with thoracolumbar trauma described using a figure-8 tension band technique as a modification of spinal stapling. 48 Complications from this technique were not observed. 48 Successful use of pins and polymethylmethacrylate to stabilize a lumbar fracture in a cat has been described. 63 This form of treatment provides significant stability, particularly for rotational forces. 64 Optimal placement of pins within the vertebral body may be difficult because of the small size of typical feline vertebral bodies. Complications of this procedure include pin migration, pin breakage, pneumothorax, and additional trauma to soft tissue structures.",

            "text": "Outcome for cats with spinal trauma is guarded. Survival rate in one study was only 60 per cent. 46 Cats that did not survive were euthanized or died within 4 days of the injury. Cats with spinal fractures and absence of deep pain perception almost always have a hopeless prognosis. The return of motor function does not equate necessarily with return of voluntary urination. 48 Spinal Walking: from Laboratory to Clinics. Prognosis for return of voluntary motor function in cases of absent deep pain perception generally is considered grave. However, the cat has been the subject of extensive experimental work studying the return of ambulation after spinalization, or complete transection of the spinal cord. \"Spinal walking\" is a clinical term used for return of ambulation in an animal with no deep pain perception in the pelvic limbs. In the laboratory setting, this phenomenon is known as spinal locomotion. Pelvic limbs are under no voluntary control, and the thoracic limbs move asynchronously with the pelvic limbs when on a treadmill. Spinal locomotion may be evident within a few days of the injury. 66 The spinal cord generates this pattern of limb movement, which allows for the placement each foot, weight-bearing, and alterations of speed with change in treadmill velocity. 65 The animal also is capable of stepping over objects placed in its way. 66 Cats have been trained to develop spinal locomotion after complete experimental spinal cord transection at T13. The underlying mechanism may be the result of a spinal locomotor generator. 66 Spinal locomotion is dependent on the development and preparation of a spinal locomotor pattern generator, stimulation of cutaneous receptors, alterations of intraspinal neurochemistry, and input from the midlumbar spinal cord. 66 Plasticity occurs within the spinal cord as a result of training. Lesion location within the spinal cord also can affect the ability to walk; for example, a lesion at the L3-L4 spinal segment is not conducive to development of spinal locomotion. 65 Spinal walking in a cat with a complete spinal cord injury is much less likely to occur without training. 67 Animals with complete spinal cord transections and no training can begin to take steps within weeks of the injury. 65 Cats with naturally occurring spinal trauma had a low success rate in development of spinal locomotion after injury. Reasons for the low success were attributed to less controlled spinal injury and inadequate physical therapy/training. Training for 30 minutes daily 5 days a week provides an 87 per cent success rate of weight-bearing in the pelvic limbs. 68 Without appropriate rehabilitation the rate drops to 33 per cent. 69 Variability exists among cats as to when walking movements begin to occur. 66 Repeated training of a cat by placing the thoracic limbs on a nonmoving platform and the pelvic limbs on a treadmill resulted in better walking and weight-bearing ability in the pelvic limbs. 65 This process involves the use of a treadmill, tail support, and various forms of stimulation. 70 Cutaneous stimulation is important for afferent sensory input. Younger animals tend to have a better recovery rate for walking. 66 Training activities resulted in almost all cats regaining the ability to walk. Early intensive training allowed for better walking. 66 Spinal locomotion is maintained only for a finite period after discontinuation of training activities and begins to show decline after 12 weeks. 71 Long-Term Management of a Deep Pain-Negative Cat. Much has been learned in cats after experimental spinal cord injury regarding optimal medical management of deep pain-negative cats. 70 Bladder expression is required at a minimum of twice daily. Some cats urinate without expression, but the bladder is not emptied completely. Stimulation of the perineum initiates a mass reflex and partial emptying of the bladder. 70 Researchers report that treadmill training also stimulates urination and defecation in cats with complete spinal cord injuries. 70 Inadequate emptying of the bladder predisposes to chronic urinary tract infections 70 (see Chapter 48) . Suggestions for care to prevent this problem include adequate bladder expression and water intake. 70 Chronic bladder infections weaken the muscular wall, further complicating manual emptying of the bladder. 70 Fecal elimination usually can occur without assistance and is aided by perineal stimulation. 70 Diarrhea and constipation still can occur as complications.",

Intervertebral disc disease (IVDD) is recognized commonly in cats with approximately 27 published cases. 72 Several case series have been published in recent years. [73] [74] [75] The incidence of IVDD as a significant clinical problem compared to other diseases that affect cats has been reported to be 0.12 per cent. 74 Earlier clinical reports of disc disease in cats were postmortem studies that described cervical and, to a lesser extent, lumbar disc disease in older cats. [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] These discs were mostly Hansen type II, with bulging of the annulus fibrosus into the spinal canal, and were described as incidental findings. Characteristics of a degenerated intervertebral disc suggest some degree of chondroid degeneration of the discs. 72 More recent literature describes Hansen type I, with extrusion of nucleus pulposus into the spinal canal, and recognizes this type to be the most common form of disc-related spinal cord compression in cats. 74 IVDD also can occur spontaneously in cats having no history of trauma. 74 IVDD occurs more frequently in middle to older aged cats. Mean age for all reported cases is 7 years. 72 The age range varies somewhat in different reports, between 3 and 9 years, 73 and 4 and 17 years (mean age of 9.8). 74 No gender or breed predilections exist for IVDD in cats.",

Treatment. Treatment strategies have been extrapolated from treatment options recommended in other species with FCE. This consists of high doses of MPSS (if the drug can be administered within 8 hours of the onset of clinical signs), adequate fluid therapy, bladder management, and supportive care. Once the cat is stabilized, physical therapy may aid in recovery. Prognosis in these cases is difficult to predict because the literature in this area shows some bias as definitive diagnosis requires necropsy.

            "text": "Clinical Presentation and Pathogenesis. Diverticulum within the subarachnoid space results in accumulation of CSF and compression of the spinal cord, which causes neurological dysfunction. These diverticula are not true cysts but rather leptomeningeal cavitations that are filled with CSF. 93 Spinal arachnoidal cysts have been reported to cause paresis in cats. [90] [91] [92] [93] Another case report documented an intradural epithelial-lined cyst found at the vertebral body of C7 in a 2 1 /2year-old female Burmese cat. 93 Location of these cyst formations is variable in cats and can occur in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. The cause of arachnoidal cysts is unknown, but may be related to factors that include previous trauma, inflammation, and developmental or congenital malformations. 92 An arachnoidal cyst in a 7-year-old spayed female domestic shorthair cat with paraparesis was associated with a lordotic malalignment of the caudal thoracic spine. 92 Affected cats usually are young to middle-age with a range between 2 and 7 years of age. Clinical signs usually are chronic and progressive and reflect the location of the cyst. Duration of clinical signs is chronic and progressive in onset. A cat in one report showed signs for only a few weeks. 90 Diagnosis. Diagnosis of spinal arachnoidal cysts is made using myelography, CT-myelography, or MRI. The diverticulum is identified with myelography as a teardrop shape within the subarachnoid space ( Figure 51-5) . 92 Magnetic resonance imaging can document a spinal arachnoidal cyst on a T2weighted sequence as an area of hyperintensity. 93 Treatment. Reports of treatment protocols for spinal arachnoidal cysts in cats have been limited. Surgical fenestration has been reported. 90,91,93 A hemilaminectomy or dorsal laminectomy is used to expose the cystic structure for dural fenestration and possible excision of the cyst. Outcome in these cases has been excellent with complete recovery. Residual neurological deficits may occur. Histopathology of the cyst wall is recommended to rule out other lesions. Palliative medical management consists of antiinflammatory doses of corticosteroids.",
