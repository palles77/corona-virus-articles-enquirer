            "text": "Coyotes (Canis latrans) are seasonally monestrous and form perennial pair-bonds. Breeding is dominated by each pack's alpha male and female, and both sexes share responsibility for territory defense and pup-rearing. They are also opportunistic predators on domestic livestock and pets. But while dominant adults have been implicated as primary killers, depredation is reduced when coyotes are without pups. Contraception, therefore, may represent a non-lethal solution for conflicts between coyotes and humans. Steroid hormones successfully control fertility in some species, but have been considered contraindicated in wildlife and canids in particular; specific concerns include possible induction of aberrant behavior, or uterine and hematopoietic pathologies. Herein we describe a study examining the physiological effectiveness, health safety, and behavioral consequences following treatment of estrous coyotes with exogenous estrogen. We treated captive adult female coyotes in estrus with 0.01 mg/kg estradiol benzoate (EB), either before (n = 5) or immediately after ovulation (n = 6), then documented reproductive outcome, physiological variables and behavioral responses, during and after treatment. Pregnancy was averted in six females treated after ovulation, suggesting that appropriate timing of treatment proved crucial. A transient suppression of sexual behavior was observed, and in some cases, estrus appeared slightly lengthened. However, neither ovulation nor mating behavior was fully suppressed. Importantly, non-pregnant females (and their mates) displayed diestrous socio-sexual behavior similar to pregnant coyotes (behavioral pseudopregnancy). Furthermore, nonpregnant coyotes did not mate again until the next native breeding season, and we observed no deleterious physiological effects during diestrus or subsequent ovarian cycles.",

            "text": "Coyotes (Canis latrans) are native North American wild canids. Their reproductive strategy includes social monogamy, territoriality (Camenzind, 1978; Andelt, 1985; Bekoff and Wells, 1986; Gese, 2001) , and biparental care of offspring (Gier, 1968; Silver and Silver, 1969; Mengel, 1971; Camenzind, 1978; Andelt, 1985; Hatier, 1995) . Confined to a single mating season each winter, coyote reproduction is regulated by the female's annual ovarian cycle, as well as seasonal fluctuation in male spermatogenesis (Hamlett, 1938; Gier, 1968; Kennelly, 1978; Sacks, 2005) . Ovulation is spontaneous, synchronous, and bilateral (Hamlett, 1938; Kennelly and Johns, 1976) . Gier (1968) considered early embryonic development in the coyote to be similar to the domestic dog (Canis familiaris); thus embryos likely pass into the uterus 8-10 days after ovulation, and placentation begins around day 16 (Holst and Phemister, 1971; Concannon et al., 1989; Tsutsui, 1989) . Coyote litters averaging 3-7 pups are typically born March-May in most North American latitudes after a gestation of 60-63 days (Hamlett, 1938; Gier, 1968) .",

The present study, therefore, was designed to examine what influence steroid hormone treatment might have on intra-pair interactions of a wild canid species. Coyotes represent a good candidate for contraceptive or contragestive regimens because, as previously stated, breeding is confined to a single annual opportunity. Also, both alpha male and female defend their mates during the breeding season; thereby prohibiting access to their mates by same-sex competitors while suppressing mating among subordinate pack members. Keeping a pack intact would also help maintain social stability within the local population (Bromley and Gese, 2001a; Gese, 2001) .",

Documented appetitive and sexually explicit coyote mating behaviors included: (a) olfactory sampling (sniff/lick of the female's anogenital region by the male, female solicitation with diverted tail, and sniff/lick of the male's inguinal area by the female); (b) pre-coital mounts or mounting attempts; and (c) copulation tie/lock. Affinitive social behaviors observed in proestrus and estrus included: (a) courtship (non-antagonistic play-wrestling and play-chases, allo-grooming such as licking the face, ears or back, also body-bumps, hip-pushes, or sleeping curled against each other); and (b) mate-guarding (the male shadowing the female around the pen walking or trotting with his head and shoulders adjacent to her flank, or when in view of a neighbor the male would stand on the female with stiff forelegs on her back, or stand over her as she lay on the ground). During diestrus, female begging was characterized by a submissive juvenile-like posture reminiscent of pups begging food from adults (tail, neck and head held below top-line of the back, rapid tail wagging, and biting, licking at male's lower jaw and mouth), which may or may not provoke a reflexive regurgitation response from the male.",

Sometimes the males moved away, attempting to evade their mate's mouth-licking, but reprimands were rare. The earliest event of begging was observed on day 6 post-ovulation between a treatment pair that copulated but did not become pregnant.

For example, during Protocol 1, one female experienced a splitestrus, copulating only on day 1 and day 6 post-ovulation, but had a healthy litter of four pups.

For example, plasma samples from the sole pregnant female in Protocol 2 yielded unusual relaxin results. In previous years, >90% of pregnant coyotes tested positive for relaxin by day 27 post-ovulation, yet the first sample taken from this female on day 28 was negative. The next sample collected on day 42 (although positive) had a weaker response pattern than expected and more typical of results observed on day 32. We speculate that in this particular case blastocyst(s) development may have been retarded; either because of adverse changes in oviducal fluid, or through a more direct embryotoxic effect of estradiol (Kennelly, 1969; J\u00f6chle et al., 1975; Tsutsui et al., 2006) . But with embryonic demise incomplete, a placenta (the site of relaxin synthesis in canines) could, nevertheless, have been established (Tsutsui et al., 2006) . Subsequent normal development of the placenta and/or fetus, however, was compromised because the pregnancy ultimately failed and pups were never seen.",

Interruption of sexual activity (split-estrus) may be attributed to the iatrogenic estradiol surge (because most of the females had a suppression of mounts and ties). But the greater incidence of extended estrus (which occurred in 3 of 6 non-pregnant females as well as the failed pregnancy case described above) cannot be adequately explained in the present study; although it would be consistent with the domestic dog model to presume that re-emergence of sexual activity was linked to estradiol withdrawal and normalization of the estradiol:progesterone ratio (Concannon et al., 1979; Chakraborty et al., 1980) . Such a rebound effect, however, would only be outstanding if outside the established range for a normal estrus (i.e., >10 days post-ovulation). Otherwise, a rebound occurring during the expected estrus time-frame might go unnoticed. Unfortunately, the frequency, duration, and resolution of the hormone data collected were inadequate for a retrospective analysis of such a rebound effect.",
