We describe the brief details of interaction among the bats and unknown hosts, then among the peoples and the infections reservoir (seafood market). The seafood marked are considered the main source of infection when the bats and the unknown hosts (may be wild animals) leaves the infection there. The purchasing of items from the seafood market by peoples have the ability to infect either asymptomatically or symptomatically. We reduced the model with the assumptions that the seafood market has enough source of infection that can be effective to infect people. We present the mathematical results of the model and then formulate a fractional model. We consider the available infection cases for January 21, 2020, till January 28, 2020 and parameterized the model. We compute the basic reproduction number for the data is R 0 % 2:4829. The fractional model is then solved numerically by presenting many graphical results, which can be helpful for the infection minimization.",

However some instructions have been given and boundaries have been placed such that some law of nature should not be violated. In the process of controlling nature, they have constructed very powerful instruments that allow them to have control of some important places like the sea, air and ground. The secure survival of their kind, and also eliminate each living being that can be a threat for their survival, they have developed powerful weapons including guns, bombs, medications, technical instrument that can help them identify sickness, their origin, and how to eliminate them. Although they have succeeded so far to be on top of the game, violation of fundamental laws of nature has led to many natural disasters. For example failure to observe the law of cohabitation has led mankind to use heavy weapons to killing each other, some of the biggest that have been recorded in the history of mankind are World War 1 and 2, of course that there are many other genocides that have ended with massif loss of human live. Failure to observe the natural law of co-habitation has also led to xenophobia, a new man-made-disease that has spread around Africa and many other part of the world. While concepts like nationality have been introduced to divide mankind, while diplomatic, securities and many other measures have put in place to support the idea of nationality, mankind fails to understand that the world belong to nature and each leaving being therein are passengers. More precisely such concept has created many inequalities around the world. One can be in charge today but tomorrow he is no longer in charge the nature has recalled some of his parts. The misuse of sexual activity has led to many sexually transmitted diseases that have killed more than millions of souls in the last decades. One could list many other problems that occurred due to mankind violating the law of nature.",

Do we really have to eat everything? Do we really have to physically interact with every living being? The answer to these questions is of course no because, nature has offered mankind some fruits, vegetables, sea-foods and some meats that humans can use for their survival, however, there exist in nature other fruits, vegetables and sealiving being cannot be used for their survival. It is also true that there exist in nature some living being that do not have to be in any form of contact with humans. It is for instance widely believed that, the world deathly disease called HIV has its genesis from crossed species from chimpanzees to humans. This transmitted disease was pre-1980 unknown and transmission was not accompanied by visible signs or symptoms. It is also documented that, by 1980, HIV may have spread to five continents, also within this period around 300000 persons were infected. Ebola, a deathly infectious disease that has killed many humans around the world in the past last years is believed by scientists to have come from an infected animal such as a fruit bat or non-human primate. Lassa fever is believed to have come from rates. One can list many other deathly diseases that come from the interaction between humans and other living-beings. So far humans have developed several medical techniques and put in place many measure to prevent, even cure some the above listed diseases. While they thought to have master nature, the corona-virus occurs and has already killed many people in China, and has been discovered to other parts of the world including Europe and Africa. The 2019 corona-virus also called the Wuhan corona-virus, is a transmitted virus causing respiratory infection and highly transmitted from human to human. In this paper, we aim to suggest and present mathematical analysis underpinning the spread of such deathly disease and present some prediction with real world data.",

The purpose of using the Atangana-Baleanu derivative to the model is that it has many properties such as their kernel is nonlocal and nonsingular, and the crossover behavior in the model can only be best described using this operator. The others operators such as Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio which does not posses these properties may or may not well describe the dynamics of corona virus. Although in future, we study the this corona virus model in other operators such as Caputo and Caputo-Fabrizio and their comparison with Atangana-Baleanu derivative and will conclude which operator is more appropriate for this model. Research related Atangana-Baleanu derivative and their applications to various models arising in science and engineering can be seen in [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Some other related papers to the applications of Atangana-Baleanu derivative can be seen in [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] We consider the reported cases since January 21, 2020 till January 28, 2020, which are higher than the initial days and formulate a mathematical model to parameterize the model. We give brief details about the mathematical modeling of the novel corona virus in Section 2. Some fundamental properties of the model and their stability will be explored in Section 3. We then, formulate the model in fractional derivatives and presented a numerical scheme for their solution in Section 4. The data versus model fitting for the given period will be shown in Section 5 and also, we briefly discuss the numerical results with many values of the fractional order q. Concluding remarks will be provided in Section 6.",
