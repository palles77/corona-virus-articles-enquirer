The nucleotide sequence of BBV RNA1 (3105 bases) has been determined, and this, together with the sequence of BBV RNA2 (1399 bases) provides the complete primary structure of the BBV genome. The RNA1 sequence encompasses a 5' non-coding region of 38 nucleotides, a coding region for a protein of predicted molecular weight 101,873 (protein A, implicated in viral RNA synthesis) and a 3' proximal region encoding RNA3 (389 bases), a subgenomic messenger RNA made in infected cells but not encapsidated into virions. The RNA3 sequence starts 16 bases inside the coding region of protein A and contains two overlapping open reading frames for proteins of molecular weight 10,760 and 11,633, one of which is believed to be protein B, made in BBV-infected cells. A limited homology exists between the sequences of RNA1 and RNAB. Sequence regions have been identified that provide energetically favorable bonding between RNA2 and RNA1 possibly to facilitate their common encapsidation, and between RNA2 and negative strand RNA1 possibly to regulate the production of RNA3.",

Since RNA3 is produced in RNAl-transfected cells but is not needed for infectivity (Gallagher et al., 1983) we assumed that its entire sequence is encoded in RNAl, and indeed inspection showed that the sequence of the 306 bases at the 5' end of the RNA3 sequence were found to be identical to the sequence of the 306 bases at the 3' end of the partial RNA1 sequence, above. Thus, we synthesized a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the 15 bases at the 3' terminus of RNA3 sequence and used it for RNA1 priming. This oligonucleotide served as an efficient primer for cDNA sequencing of RNA1 and, as expected, yielded an RNA1 sequence identical to the remaining 83 bases of RNAS. We cannot unequivocally rule out the possibility that bases exist to the right of position 3105. However, this is unlikely inasmuch as we were able to label the 3' termini of both double-stranded RNA1 and RNA3 (obtained from infected cells) with [32P]pCp and T4 ligase, and showed that the 3' termini of their positive strands have the sequence we reported immediately to the left of base 3105, and moreover that these sequences terminate with a 3' hydroxyl group. The molecular weight of RNA1 calculated from the sequence is 1.02 x lo6 and is in good agreement with the estimated molecular weight of RNA1 as obtained by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Longworth & Carey, 1976 ) and by oligonucleotide fingerprinting (Clewley et al., 1982) . The RNA1 sequence contains several A-rich regions, among them the sequence G-A-A-A-G-A-A-A-A-G (bases 1052 to 1061) which we judge to be the site of the observed strong internal priming with oligo(dT).",

Although it is likely that production of these proteins is regulated at several levels in the course of virus replication, in vitro studies suggest that regulation at the level of initiation of translation is very significant. Both proteins are translated well in homologous (Drosophila lysates) and in heterologous (rabbit reticulocyte lysates) cell-free systems, synthesis of protein alpha being much greater than that of protein A (Guarino et al., 1981; Friesen & Rueckert, 1984) . It is known that initiation of translation of eukaryotic messenger RNA is favored by the existence of an A, three nucleotides before the initiating codon, and a G following the initiation codon (Kozak, 1981) . We note that both leader sequences are short, and that the leader sequence of RNA1 (38 bases) is 55% A, and the leader sequence of RNA2 (22 bases) contains 45% A. Both RNAs have an A in the -3 position. They differ in that RNA2 has a G in the +4 position as well ( Fig. 5(a) ). They also differ in that the first 19 bases of the leader sequence of RNA1 (but not of RNAS) can be folded into a stem and loop structure ( Fig. 5(b) ), which might be expected to impair initiation of translation.",

In corona viruses (Baric et al., 1983; Spaan et al., 1983) , fusion of 5'terminal sequences of genomic RNA to the 5' ends of coding regions of mRNAs to produce subgenomic RNAs has been reported. A well-documented case is that' of Sindbis virus (Ou et al., 1983) where the subgenomic RNA derives from partial transcription of the genomic negative strand. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated recently that the subgenomic RNA of brome mosaic virus (BMV RNA4) is made by partial transcription of BMV RNA3 negative strand (Miller et al., 1985) . We have therefore considered the possibility that BBV RNA3 is made by a similar mechanism. It has been shown (Gallagher et al., 1983 ) that cells transfected with RNA1 alone produce not only RNA1 but also large quantities of RNA3 and protein B. and furthermore that synthesis of RNA3 and protein B is progressively less with increased amounts of RNA2 present in the RNA1 preparation used for transfect'ion.",

These regions also contain a direct repeat and a sequence complementary to the direct repeat which can form a stable stem and loop structure (AG of about -20 kcal (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ) calculated as described by Salser (1977) ).
