Veterinarians investigating outbreaks of neonatal calf diarrhea must first make recommendations for treating affected calves and then take action to protect susceptible and unborn calves from ongoing illness. Finally, attention should focus on determining what future actions might prevent the disease in subsequent calving periods or seasons. 4 Although knowledge of the pathogens involved is often useful information, outbreak investigations sometimes become sidetracked in the sole pursuit of an etiologic agent rather than identifying more useful explanations for the outbreak. Knowing the etiologic agent may provide an explanation for the proximal cause of a calf's illness or death, but that knowledge rarely explains the outbreak or provides a solution for treatment, control, or prevention. The goal, then, is to conduct a useful outbreak investigation-one that leads to a solution to the problem.",

            "text": "Veterinarians are often asked to investigate outbreaks of animal death or disease, including those related to neonatal calf diarrhea. The objectives of these investigations are commonly to (1) reduce the losses associated with existing cases and (2) prevent new cases from occurring. These objectives are met by (1) confirming the clinical diagnosis so that affected individuals are treated appropriately, (2) making an appropriate population diagnosis to determine the reasons for the outbreak, (3) identifying actions that can be taken to prevent new cases or future outbreaks, and (4) effectively communicating the plan of action. It can be difficult to provide solutions to disease outbreaks, but success is more likely if an organized, epidemiologic approach to outbreak investigation is followed. 5, 6 Disease outbreaks (epidemics) are typically defined as an unexpected increase in disease or death, typically occurring during a brief period of time. Outbreaks may occur because of a common (point-source) exposure (eg, the potato salad at the church picnic). These types of outbreaks are typically rapid in development and resolution or they may become propagated epidemics (eg, you got sick from the church supper and then your family got sick and passed it on to friends at school). Propagated epidemics are typically characterized by less rapid but ongoing transmission from animal to animal. The distinction between these two types of outbreaks sometimes becomes blurred, but often they are distinguishable by observing the epidemic curve. Methods to prevent new cases may differ depending on the type of epidemic (eg, removing the potato salad or isolating sick individuals). 7 Outbreak investigations involve an orderly process to characterize the outbreak:",

If records exist at all, they may be on paper (eg, in pocket-sized ranch books) or in an electronic format with free text fields, none of which allow the veterinarian or the producer to quickly and easily discover animal health relationships. Some electronic record-keeping systems capture health information and may present information in standard graphs or summaries, but do not allow easy querying of health relationships. Free text fields are difficult or impossible to analyze because of misspelled words, multiple names, or descriptors for the same disease (eg, diarrhea, scours, loose, enteric) and multiple pieces of information in the same field (eg, scours, T103.8, bolus and fluids, retreat afternoon, watch out for the cow). The lack of a simple record-keeping system has hindered many disease outbreak investigations. It simply becomes too costly to wade through inefficient record systems to get the needed information from which questions can be asked. A desirable system for investigating neonatal calf diarrhea is one that captures individual calf information for all calves at risk, not just affected calves. Useful information includes the calf's identification, the identification of the dam, the age of the dam, the calf's birth date, the date of onset of the illness, the date of onset of other illnesses, and information describing various risk factors of interest.",

In fact, it may be rare that knowledge of the presence of an agent by itself leads to a solution to outbreaks of neonatal calf diarrhea. To make effective recommendations for corrective actions following an outbreak, one often needs to understand how the pathogen interacts within the production system. For example, once you know the agent involved, it might still be useful to understand the various sources of the agent and routes of transmission on the farm. Neonatal calf diarrhea is a complex, multifactorial, and temporally dynamic disease process. [9] [10] [11] The factors that explain neonatal disease are the agent, factors related to host resistance or susceptibility to disease, and factors about the environment that favor the host or agent. These factors interact dynamically over time. To control the disease or prevent its occurrence, it is important to understand the relationships between these multiple factors and how they interact within the production system. 12 It may be more useful to diagnose the failure of passive transfer or recognize a vehicle of pathogen transmission than to know the specific agent involved. Population diagnostics is concerned with correctly diagnosing or classifying the outbreak by agent, host, environment, and temporal factors. ",

Bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, and cryptosporidia can be found in most cattle populations and can be recovered from calves in herds not experiencing calf diarrhea. 12 It is not unusual to be able to find multiple agents in herds experiencing outbreaks of calf diarrhea, suggesting that even during outbreaks, more than one agent may be involved. The adult cow herd commonly serves as the reservoir of pathogens from one year to the next. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Often outbreak investigations take place long after cases have occurred, so opportunities to identify pathogens have past. If neonatal diarrhea cases are ongoing, pathogen diagnostics may be helpful to the investigation (see article by Blanchard in this issue). For example, it may be useful to know if the pathologic condition is caused by bacterial or viral pathogens because that knowledge may guide treatment decisions, lead to hypotheses about routes and sources of exposure, or create awareness of zoonotic potential. Also, serologic responses or even recovery of the agent are not necessarily clear indications that the pathogen is a primary pathogen in the condition being investigated. The recovery of one pathogen may not mean that there are not other players, and the relative prevalence of agents recovered from neonatal calf diarrhea cases may simply reflect the relative ease of detecting the agent. Finally, diagnostics for the purpose of outbreak investigation are almost always conducted to answer population-based questions. Rarely is the question about what pathogen is causing diarrhea in a particular calf. More often the question is whether to and how to adequately test for pathogens that are affecting the health of the herd.",

Diarrhea may be observed in colostrum-deprived and gnotobiotic calves within a few days of pathogen challenge regardless of age. [33] [34] [35] Calves may have an age-specific susceptibility to neonatal diarrhea that occurs as maternal immunity is waning and before the calf is capable of an active immune response. 28 Regardless of the reason for the age-specificity of neonatal calf diarrhea, this period defines the age of calf susceptibility as well as the age calves are most likely to become infective and shed the agents in their feces. 25, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] Age-specificity of susceptibility and infectivity has important implications for preventing the transmission of the pathogens of neonatal diarrhea because, in some calving systems, the number of susceptible and infective calves can change dynamically with time ( Fig. 3) .

This multiplier effect can result in high calf infectivity and widespread environmental contamination with pathogens. 46 Each calf serves as growth media for pathogen production, amplifying the dose load of the pathogen it received. [35] [36] [37] Therefore, calves born later in a calving season may receive larger dose loads of pathogens and, in turn, may become relatively more infective by growing even greater numbers of agents. Eventually, the dose load of pathogens overwhelms the calf's ability to resist disease. These factors alone or in combination may explain observations that calves born later in the calving season are at greater risk for disease or death (Fig. 4) . 31, 32 Test causal hypotheses using epidemiologic principles",

In disease causal theory, each factor that contributes to the development of disease is a component cause. Disease is observed when various component causes add up to complete a sufficient cause, which explains why some component causes are observed in the absence of disease (eg, we might recover Cryptosporidia from the feces of calves without diarrhea). This concept also explains why the manager of a herd that does a good job of assuring passive transfer might blame calf diarrhea on bad weather, whereas the manager of a herd in a moderate climate might observe diarrhea when they have been lax about assuring adequate colostrum intake. Removing one component cause means that the Smith sufficient cause is not completed and, thus, disease is not observed. 47 For example, one sufficient cause for neonatal calf diarrhea might include component causes of (1) exposure to rotavirus, (2) failure of passive transfer, and (3) weather stress. In the absence of other completed sufficient causes, the removal of any one of these factors would keep calves from developing diarrhea. In general, the objective of the investigation is to determine which possible component causes are contributing to the completion of a sufficient cause and determine which component causes (also known as causal factors or risk factors) are key determinants. Key determinants are those causal factors that can be modified. In the simple example described earlier, we might find it difficult to prevent exposure to rotavirus or correct the weather, so improving passive transfer might be the key determinant.",

Each has helped guide our thinking about causes of disease. 48 Each suggests making a case for a causal relationship by finding the proposed cause (1) preceding the effect, (2) having a strong association with the effect, (3) being associated with the effect in more than one study, (4) demonstrating a dose effect, and (5) being consistent with current knowledge. These criteria can help guide the outbreak investigation; although, it is important to recognize that none are necessary or sufficient for determining if a causal relationship exists. Also important is the recognition of the cognitive biases that may prevent veterinarians from drawing the correct conclusions from an investigation. 48 Sometimes the primary causal question is this: What is different about the calves that got sick and those that did not? But more often the question is this: What is the difference between this herd and other herds not experiencing an outbreak? Some causal factors are characteristics of individuals; other causes are characteristics of groups or herds. If the important causal factors occur at the herd level, it will not be possible to measure this association by comparing (statistically or otherwise) affected and nonaffected calves within a single herd. For example, if an important causal factor is the presence of BVDV circulating among cattle in the herd, it is likely that all calves become exposed to the virus, whether they get sick or not. The inference that BVDV is contributing to disease comes from comparing its presence in this herd with what is expected or observed in other herds. On the other hand, in this same herd, it may Field Disease Diagnostic Investigation be possible to determine that failure of passive protection is also a causal factor by comparing postsuckling immunoglobulin G levels between affected and nonaffected calves within the same herd.",

Causal inferences in qualitative investigations are largely based on systems of logic developed by John Stuart Mill in the nineteenth century. 48 According to Mill, a causal factor might be identified by the method of agreement if the factor is common to multiple instances of the outcome when other factors are dissimilar (eg, finding that scours outbreaks are common to herds feeding a particular milk replacer, even though other management practices differ). A causal factor might also be identified by the method of difference if a particular factor differs, whereas others remain the same (eg, if calves receiving milk replacer from one bag develop diarrhea, but calves on the same farm receiving milk replacer from another bag do not). Finally, causal relationships may be revealed by the method of concomitant variations if the risk for the outcome changes with the level of the risk factor, all other factors being the same (eg, the more time that calves remain in the maternity pen, the greater the incidence of diarrhea).",

            "text": "When data are available, a quantitative approach is often more useful for discovering causal relationships and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. The best study design for evaluating causal relationships depends on the circumstances. There are 3 basic observational study designs: (1) case-control, (2) cohort or longitudinal, and (3) cross-sectional. Case-control studies compare odds of exposure among cases to the odds of exposure among noncases. Case-control studies excel when the disease is rare and when there are many potential exposures to test. Cohort and longitudinal studies compare incidence of disease among subjects with an exposure to the incidence of those without the exposure. Cohort and longitudinal studies are best when data exist to follow subjects over time, either prospectively or retrospectively. Cross-sectional studies look at the relationship between disease and exposure prevalence at a point in time. 53 The statistical measure of association is important because it helps relate the strength of the relationship between the risk factor and the occurrence of disease. When the outcome is dichotomous (eg, diseased or not diseased), the measure of association is the odds ratio or (in some cases) relative risk (RR). These measures are measures of the odds, probability, or incidence rate of observing disease with an exposure level compared with another exposure level (Figs. 5 and 6 ). If the odds ratio has a value of 1, then the exposure is not associated with the disease. If the odds ratio is greater than 1, then that exposure is associated with the disease. If the odds ratio is less than 1, then the exposure is associated with the absence of disease (eg, it is protective from disease). The further the odds ratio is from 1, the stronger the association.",

However, the endemic nature of the common pathogens of neonatal calf diarrhea makes it unlikely that cattle populations could be made biosecure from these agents; therefore, a biocontainment approach to control neonatal calf diarrhea seems prudent and logical. 55, 56 Biocontainment actions against neonatal diarrhea might include those that improve passive transfer of maternal antibodies or reducing effective contacts. Maternal immunity is important to calf resistance to enteric agents, 11,57 but maternal immunity wanes with time. 28 Dairy producers might be able to improve maternal immunity by managing colostrum quality and quantity, but managers of extensive beef cattle systems have limited practical opportunities to improve rates of passive antibody transfer.
