            "text": "Many important animal, bacterial, fungal, and plant viruses have genomes of positive-stranded (messenger-sense) RNA . Over the last 12 years it has become clear that some viruses in these different types of hosts have related genes, and sometimes similar arrangements of genes and modes of gene expression, leading to suggestions about evolutionary pathways (Haseloff et al., 1984; Kamer and Argos, 1984; Ahlquist et al., 1985; Goldbach, 1986; Zimmern, 1988; Strauss and Strauss, 1988; Habili and Symons, 1989; Bruenn, 1991; Goldbach et al., 1991; Koonin, 1991a; Koonin and Dolja, 1993; Dolja et al., 1994; Goldbach and de Haan, 1994; Ward, 1994) . Goldbach and de Haan (1994) outlined four possible evolu-tionary pathways to account for the observed relationships between viruses of different host types: convergent evolution, transduction (introgression) of (conserved) host genes, common ancestry, interviral recombination. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities provide evidence for common ancestries of genes and, in cases where gene orders and modes of gene expression are similar (e.g., cowpea mosaic virus and poliovirus; Goldbach, 19SS) , possibly of viruses. However, there is also good evidence that recombination between RNAs of different viruses has played a n important role in virus evolution (Lai, 1992 Simon and Bujarski, 1994) . Since mixed infections of positivestranded RNA viruses and viruses with different genome types, such as single-stranded (ss) DNA, double-stranded (ds) DNA, negativestranded RNA, or dsRNA, are also possible, acquisition of genes from such disparate viruses is also possible. For example, some animal coronaviruses (positive-stranded RNA) and influenza virus C (negative-stranded RNA) have related hemagglutinin-esterase proteins (Cavanagh and MacNaughton, 1994) . Recent studies have also indicated that some positive-stranded RNA viruses have acquired genes from the host, e g . , the HSP70 heat-shock chaperone protein gene analogues found in viruses of the plant closterovirus genus (Dolja ct al., 1994; Klaasen ct ul., 1995) ; other examples are reviewed by . Recombination between positive-stranded viral RNA and transgenic plant transcripts has been demonstrated (Greene and Allison, 1994) . The concept has therefore developed of modular evolution of positive-stranded RNA viruses, with the possibility of genes or groups of genes with related functions, e.g., replication genes or structural genes, having been acquired from different sources.",

Such high mutation rates have probably limited the size of (unsegmented) RNA genomes, the largest being the animal coronaviruses (up to -30 kh) and the plant closteroviruses (up to -20 kb) and most being <10 kb, although some form of editing remains a possibility for the largest RNA genomes.",

            "text": "Positive-stranded RNA viruses have also evolved (or acquired) genes with functions specific for their hosts. A large number of positivcstranded RNA viruses (over 600 species) are adapted to replication and spread in plant hosts . One important adaptation is the requirement of plant viruses to spread from cell to cell through the plasmodesmatal connections. Plant viruses encode specialized movement proteins which modify the plasmodesmata in a variety of ways to allow the (active) passage of viral nucleic acids, nucleoproteins, or particles (Waigmann and Zambryski, 1994; Lucas and Gilbertson, 1994) . Since there is evidence that plant proteins and/or mRNAs move through plasmodesmata during the course of normal plant development (Lucas, 1995) , it is possible that plant viruses have become adapted to enable them to utilize an endogenous transport system for their own movement through the plant. Animal and bacterial viruses also encode specialized proteins, not needed by plant viruses, for attachment and entry into cells and for release from cells. Examples include virus attachment proteins which bind to receptors on the surface of cells, and proteins which direct budding (exocytosis) of enveloped viruses from the cell surface or which induce cell lysis. Because of the high mutation rate of RNA viruses (Doming0 and Holland, 1994) and the similarities of present-day viruses, Goldbach and de Haan (1994) considered it unlikely that common ancestors of plant and animal viruses predated the evolutionary separation of plants and animals. Insect vectors of both plant and animal positive-stranded RNA viruses are known, in some of which the viruses are able to replicate, and these were considered as the likely bridge between plant and animal viruses. Additionally, the ability of a virus to replicate in two different types of host [vertebrate and invertebrate, e.g., alphaviruses ; plant and invertebrate, e.g., marafiviruses (Gamez and Leon, 1988) l is likely to be a significant driving force in evolution. Although the insect vector hypothesis is persuasive, the possibility of evolutionary stasis has also to be considered and the additional hypothesis that some positive-stranded RNA viruses, which predated the separation of plants and animals, have provided ancestral gene clusters for current plant and animal viruses cannot be discounted.",

            "text": "The replication of the genome can be considered to be the most fundamental aspect of the biology of positive-stranded RNA viruses. This can be envisaged to take place in two main stages: (i) synthesis of a complementary (negative-stranded) RNA using the genomic positivestranded RNA as a template; (ii) synthesis of progeny positivestranded RNA using the negative-stranded RNA as a template. At least one virus-encoded protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), is required to catalyze RNA synthesis directed by the RNA template and using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Another activity is required to unwind the duplex formed between the template and newly synthesized strands. The poliovirus RdRp (3DP\"' protein) has been shown to have unwinding activity (Cho et al., 1993) . However, it is not clear whether the role of this activity in poliovirus RNA replication is to remove secondary structure in the template RNA, thereby increasing processivity of the enzyme, or to unwind duplexes formed as a result of RNA synthesis. Many positive-stranded RNA viruses also encode helicases (or putative helicases), which may function in duplex unwinding during replication. Other proteins probably have specialized roles in the initiation of RNA synthesis. By analogy with the phage Q/ 3 RdRp holoenzyme, which contains four host (bacterial) protein subunits as well as the virus-encoded polymerase subunit (Blumenthal and Carmichael, 1979; van Duin, 1988) , it is likely that RdRp holoenzymes of positive-stranded RNA viruses of eukaryotic hosts will also consist of both virus-encoded and host-encoded protein subunits. Hence the replication proteins of animal and plant positive-stranded RNA viruses, which are related in terms of amino acid sequences or gene order, may nevertheless have adapted to their particular host in terms of their interactions with host proteins. One aim of this review is to identify similarities and differences in the replication of positivestranded RNA viruses of plants and animals. As the organization and expression of replication proteins differ considerably between different groups of viruses within a particular host, a further aim will be to compare replication strategies of different virus groups. Some positivestranded RNA plant viruses also produce subgenomic RNAs which are used as mRNAs for translation of open reading frames (ORFs) which are internal in the virus genome. The different strategies which have evolved for this purpose will be compared. The replication of satellite RNAs, which by definition generally contain substantial nucleotide sequence distinct from that of the helper virus genome (reviewed by Roossinck et al., 1992; Kaper, 1995) will only be discussed when the results are relevant to replication of the genomic RNA. The subject of replicase-mediated resistance, which has been recently reviewed (Carr and Zaitlin, 1993; Baulcombe, 1994; Lomonossoff, 1995; Mueller et al., 1995) , will not be considered in this article. RNA replication is important in RNA recombination in generating hybrid RNA molecules and defective-interfering (DI) RNAs. This topic is the subject of a number of excellent recent reviews (Lai, 1992; Bujarski et al., 1994; Simon and Bujarski, 1994) and will be covered here only insofar as data on recombination impact on replication mechanisms. The retroviruses encapsidate single-stranded, messenger-sense RNA, but replicate via DNA intermediates; the replication of these viruses will not be considered here, except for brief comparisons of reverse transcriptases with other types of RNA and DNA polymerases (see Section 11,A).",

            "text": "An early debate in the study of plant positive-stranded RNAreplication was whether RNA synthesis was catalyzed by host-encoded or virus-encoded RNA polymerases. Infection of plants with a range of positive-stranded RNA viruses from different families or genera leads to increase in activity and amounts of plant RNA polymerases which are able to initiate RNA synthesis utilizing an RNA template (Fraenkel-Conrat, 1986; Schiebel et al., 1993a,b) . Similar activities have been reported from animal cells (Volloch, 1986; Volloch et al., 1987) . Crude preparations of viral RNA polymerases isolated from infected plants are often contaminated with the host RNA polymerase. The purified enzymes from several plants consist of single polypeptide chains with molecular masses in the range 100-140 kDa, they can utilize ssRNA and ssDNA as templates with no marked sequence specificity, and synthesize relatively short, heterogeneous RNA products ( 6 0 0 nt). The isolation of replication complexes, containing virus-encoded RdRp but free from the host RdRp, able to synthesize full-length viral RNA, e.g., for cowpea mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus (Hayes and Buck, 1990) , argues against a role of the host RdRp in RNA replication, a t least for the viruses studied. The biological role of the host RdRp is unknown, although it has been suggested that it may play a role in posttranscriptional suppression of gene expression (Dougherty and Parks, 1995) .",

Subsequent analyses have extended the range of viruses and identified further conserved motifs (Poch et al., 1989; Habili and Symons, 1989; Bruenn, 1991; Koonin, 1991a; Koonin and Dolja, 1993; Dolja et al., 1994) .

            "text": "The importance of some of these motifs has been confirmed by in uitro mutagenesis. Mills et al. (1988) showed that many linker insertions in a central region of the phage &R replicase gene, which included motifs I to V111, were lethal. Furthermore, mutation of the G residue of the GDD box in motif VI to M, P, S, or V reduced the phage &R replication in uiuo to <1% of wild-type; mutation of the G to A abolished replication (Inokuchi and Hirashima, 1987) . Similar mutations in the GDD box of the poliovirus 3D protein considerably reduced its RNApolymerase activity in a n in uitro assay, although the quantitative effects of the different mutations were different from those in &o; mutation of the G to A or S gave 5 to 20% of wild-type activity, while mutation of the G to C, M, P, or V abolished enzyme activity (Jablonski et al., 1991) . Furthermore, it was shown that mutation of the Y residue, which flanks the GDD box (YGDD) in the 3D protein of poliovirus and equivalent prot,eins of some related viruses (Koonin, 1991a) , to F had no effect on in uitro polymerase activity or virus viability, whereas mutations of Y to S, I, or H considerably reduced or abolished in uitro polymerase activity and were lethal. Interestingly, a Y to M mutation had no effect on in uitro (primed) polymerase activity, but reduced virus infectivity, giving rise in uiuo to a second compensatory mutation upstream of the conserved polymerase motifs; this suggested possible interaction of a n upstream region of the polymerase with the YGDD sequence of the conserved polymerase motif VI (Jablonski and Morrow, 1993) . Sankar and Porter (1992) mutated seven amino acid residues in the encephalomyocarditis 3D protein, which showed a high degree of conservation in motifs IV to VI (D235+E, motif IV; D240+E, motif IV; G294-+A, motif V; T29843, motif V; G332+E, motif VI; D333+E, motif VI; D334+E, motif VI). All of these mutations abolished, or reduced to a very low level, the in uitro RNA polymerase activity of this protein. Mutations to chemically similar residues in regions of these motifs which are conserved only in their hydrophobicity had either no effect on, or a less pronounced reduction in, enzyme activity. Mutations of the GDD box of the potato virus X 166-kDa protein to GED, ADD, or GAD abolished infectivity for plants and reduced RNA replication in protoplasts to undetectable levels (Longstaff et al., 1993) . Similarly, a G+R substitution in the GDD box of turnip yellow mosaic virus 66-kDa protein abolished RNA replication (Weiland and Dreher, 1993) . Mutations in the central polymerase-like domain of the brome mosaic virus 2a protein, encompassing motif IV and flanking sequences, also gave rise to mutants in which replication became temperature sensitive or was abolished (Kroner et al., 1989; Traynor et aZ., 1991) . A G+E mutation in motif I1 in the polymerase-like domain of the Sindbis virus nsP4 protein rendered the virus temperature-sensitive for RNA replication (Hahn et al., 1989a) . Argos (1988) , Poch et al. (1989) , Delarue et al. (1990) , and Heringa and Argos (1994) extended the amino acid sequence comparisons to include RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (reverse transcriptases), DNAdependent RNA polymerases, and DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, as well as RdRps of negative-stranded and dsRNAviruses. It was found that counterparts to the Koonin (1991a) RdRp sequence motifs IV and VI are present in many of these other types of polymerases (Table I) , leading to the suggestion of similar types of protein folds (Delarue et al., 1990; Heringa and Argos, 1994) . The three-dimensional structures of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Ollis et al., 1985) , phage T7 RNA polymerase (Sousa et al., 1993) , and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 reverse transcriptase (Koehlstaedt et al., 1992) indicate that all these polymerases contain a \"hand\" structure with a cleft formed between \"fingers,\" \"palm,\" and \"thumb\" subdomains. Further analysis of the structure of the HIV reverse transcriptase complexed with a template and primer (Jacoba-Molina et al., 1993) indicated that the template and primer are located in the cleft. Sequence motifs equivalent to IV @-strand) and VI @-strand-loop-/?strand) were located close together on the floor of the cleft within the palm subdomain, with the three conserved D residues in these motifs (Table I) , lying close to the 3'-OH of the primer and the NTP binding site in the polymerase catalytically active site; it was suggested that the function of the three D residues may be to bind the Mg2+ ions needed for polymerase activity. Recent studies of the poliovirus RdRp (3D protein) indicate that it also has a \"hand\" structure (Schultz et al., 1995) . located the NTP binding site of the polio-virus 3D protein to a region spanning motifs I1 to 111, the C-terminal part of the region being 12 residues from the conserved D residue in motif IV. Hayes et al. (1994a) and Bates et al. (1995) showed that antibodies raised to peptides corresponding to motif VI in the RdRp proteins of cucumber mosaic virus (2a protein) and red clover necrotic mosaic virus (88-kDa protein) inhibited initiation of RNA synthesis by RNA (+), positive-stranded RNA; RNA (ds), double-stranded RNA; RNA (-), negativestranded RNA.",

Although the supergroups and lineages arc undoubtably important in establishing likely evolutionary relationships between viral RdRps, it is not yet clear to what extent the sequence differences which define the supergroups reflect any significant differences in the biological properties of the RdRps or their roles in RNA replication. Evolution of RNA replication systems is probably best considered in terms of coevolution of the RNA polymerase proteins with other proteins in the replication complex and with cis-acting sequences required for RNA replication. Isolated polymerase subunits [e.g., Q/ 3 RNA polymerase subunit 2 (Landers ct al., 1974); poliovirus 3D protein (van Dyke and Flanegan, 1980; Cho et al., 1993) ] are able to catalyze RNA synthesis only on primed templates and synthesis is not template-specific. Initiation of positive-stranded and negative-stranded RNA synthesis on unprimed templates requires interaction of the core polymerase with additional proteins [host proteins in the case of &o (Blumenthal and Carmichael, 1979; van Duin, 1988) , both host-and virus-encoded proteins in the case of poliovirus (Barton et al., 1995; Xiang et al., 199Sa,b; McBride et al., 1996) ], some of which will also interact specifically with the viral RNA (which may be terminal or internal structures), conferring template specificity on the replication system. Some replication proteins are clearly multifunctional and may need to interact with different viral or host proteins a t various stages of the virus replication cycle. Charged-to-alanine mutagenesis of the poliovirus RdRp (3D protein) yielded multiple temperature-sensitive mutants defective in RNA synthesis, many of which mapped in the N-tcrminal third of the protein well away from the conserved polymerase motifs (Diamond and Kirkegaard, 1994) . Since clustered chargedto-alanine mutagenesis is designed to target residues on the surface of folded proteins, these mutants may be indicative of sites of interaction of the 3D polymerase with other viral or host proteins. Another ts mutant with a M+T mutation in the C-terminal portion of the 3D\"\"' protein was shown to be defective in the initiation of RNA replication, but not in the elongation of nascent chains (Barton et al., 1996) . This could also be indicative of a site of interaction with another viral or host protein, or the RNA template. Different modes of expression of the genes encoding replication proteins, which control the stoichiometry of their synthesis, and the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs by some viruses which requires additional recognitions and controls are clearly also important in considering the evolution of replication systems. Brief details of some additional properties, relevant to replication, of the viruses in the three supergroups are included in Table 11, together with virus supergroup designations based on these and other properties of the viruses (Goldbach and de Haan, 1994) . The classification of hepatitis E virus in the Caliciuiridae family may need to be revised because the virus shares many properties with viruses in the alpha-like supergroup.",

            "text": "Most positive-stranded RNA viruses contain ORFs with the potential to encode proteins with amino acid sequence motifs characteristic of well-defined RNA helicases and in many cases such ORFs have been shown to be essential for RNA replication, e.g., linker insertions in the helicase-like domain of the brome mosaic virus l a protein were either lethal or rendered the virus temperature-sensitive for replication of all classes of RNA (positive-strand, negative-strand, subgenomic) (Kroner et al., 1990) , and some monoclonal antibodies which mapped to the helicase-like domain of the cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) l a protein partially inhibited a purified CMV replicase complex, shown to contain the l a protein (Hayes and Buck, 1990; Hayes et al., 1994a) . Helicases could function to unwind duplexes formed during RNA replication to allow strands to act as templates for further replication. They could also have an important function in removing secondary structure from RNA templates, e.g., to aid in initiation of negative-strand synthesis on templates with extensive 3' secondary structure, such as those with tRNA-like 3' termini, and to increase the processivity of RNA polymerases through regions of internal secondary structure. In DNA replication, duplex unwinding is generally carried out by helicases and removal of secondary structure from the resultant single-stranded templates by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (Kornberg and Baker, 1992) . However, cellular RNA helicases often have the function of removing secondary structure from ssRNA, e.g., the eukaryotic translational initiation factor, eIF-4A (Merrick, 1992) . On the basis of conserved motifs, cellular and viral RNA and DNA helicases (and putative helicases) have been classified into a number of superfamilies (Gorbalenya et al., 1988; Hodgeman, 1988; Habili and Symons, 1989; Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1989; Gorbalenya et al., 1989 Gorbalenya et al., , 1990 Lain et al., 1989; Koonin and Dolja (1993) Families and genera are from Murphy et al. (1995) . A genus is only given when not assigned to a family. A, animal; B,bacterium; F, fungus: P, plant. PP, polyprotein processing; RT, readthrough; FS. frameshift; D, direct translation ' S, structure other than tRNA-like or poly(A).",

The superfamily and lineage designations for the positive-stranded virus RNA helicases and putative helicases (Koonin and Dolja, 1993) are given in Table 11 . Superfamilies 1 and 2, which have been shown to be distantly related, were each characterized by seven motifs (which could all be aligned between the two superfamilies), whereas superfamily 3 has just three motifs. Two of the motifs, versions of which are present in all three superfamilies (designated I and I1 for superfamilies 1 and 2, and A and B for superfamily 3), are variants of the ATP-binding motifs, first described by Walker et at. (1982) : A, GXXXXGK[TS] and B, @\u20acODD where X is an unspecified amino acid residue, CP is a hydrophobic residue, and the residues in square brackets are alternates. Variants of motif A are present in a vast class of both ATP-binding proteins and GTP-binding proteins; crystallographic structural studies on several of these indicate that motif A (I) is in the NTP-binding site located in a phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) between a P-strand and an a-helix. The B (11) motif may provide D residues required for chelation of Mg2+ ions which in turn bind to the terminal phosphates and promote NTP hydrolysis (Saraste et al., 1990; Schulz, 1992) . The consensus sequences for the motifs for the three viral superfamilies (Koonin and Dolja, 1993) are shown in Table 111 .",

These helicases function in a 3' to 5' direction, requiring a duplex RNA with a 3' overhang, except for eIF-4A which has bidirectional activity (but requires also eIF-4B for helicase activity). Mutagenesis of eIF-4A has shown that the AXXXXGKT motif (see motif I, Table 111 ) is required for ATP binding, whereas the DEAD sequence (see motif 11, Table 111 ) functions in ATP hydrolysis and coupling of ATP hydrolysis to helicase activity. Two other motifs, SAT (present in motif IV, Table 111 ) and HRIGRXXR (the residues shown in bold are present in motif VI, Table 111 ) were shown to be needed for eIF-4A RNA helicase activity, the latter sequence functioning specifically in RNA binding (Pause and Sonenberg, 1992; Pause et at., 1993) .

No helicase activity has yet been demonstrated for a positive-stranded RNA virus protein in this superfamily, but studies have indicated the importance of the putative helicases of cowpea mosaic virus (58-kDa protein or region of B polyprotein precursor; como helicase lineage) and poliovirus (2C protein; picorna helicase lineage) in virus replication. Mutation of the conserved K500 residue to T in the motif A sequence GKSRTGK500S in the 58-kDa domain reduced cowpea mosaic virus B RNA replication in cowpea protoplasts to an undetectable level (Peters et al., 1994) . A mutation of the conserved D545 to P in the motif B sequence MDD545 was also lethal. Both mutations were shown to act a t the protein, rather than RNA, level. However, whereas the K+T mutation in motif Acaused a small reduction in ATP binding and a n altered distibution of viral proteins, which failed to aggregate into the large cytopathic structures observed in protoplasts infected with wild-type B-RNA, no such effects were observed with the D+P mutation in motif B.",

            "text": "The poliovirus 2C protein and its NTP binding site have been shown to be essential for RNA replication. The 2C protein is present in membranous replication complexes, isolated either from infected cells (Bienz et al., 1990) or from a combined in uitro translation-replication system (Barton et al., 1995) . Poliovirus RNAreplication is inhibited by guanidine hydrochloride at the level of initiation of RNA synthesis (Caliguiri and Tamm, 1973; Barton et al., 1995) and guanidineresistant (gr) and guanidine-dependent (gd) mutants map to the 2C protein Tolskaya et al., 1994) , implying a role for the 2C protein in the initiation of RNA synthesis. Mutations in the conserved amino acids of the NTP-binding motifs A (129GSPGTGKS136) and B (176DD177), e.g., G1291, K135Q, K135R, S136T, S136A, D176L, and D177L, abolished or greatly reduced RNA synthesis (Mirzayan and Wimmer, 1992; Teterina et al., 1992) . The 2C protein, expressed in E. coli as a maltose-binding protein fusion (Rodriguez and Carrasco, 1993) or in insect cells not as a fusion (Mirzayan and Wimmer, 1994a) , has been shown to have ATPase activity. A K135Q mutation in motif A abolished ATPase activity of the insect-expressed protein. Taken together with the previous observation that this mutation in the virus greatly reduces RNA replication, this result implies that ATP hydrolysis, dependent on this site, is required for RNA replication. The defect in the mutant was probably in ATP binding since the wild-type, but not the mutant, 2C protein bound to ATP-agarose. The guanidine-resistant and guanidine-sensitive mutants mapped to a region overlapping the conserved helicase motifs, although none of the conserved amino acids was altered Tolskaya et al., 1994) . The 2C ATPase activity was not sensitive to concentrations of guanidine which inhibit poliovirus RNA replication in uiuo (Mirzayan and Wimmer, 1994a) and it was suggested that the region targeted by guanidine, while not being directly involved in ATP binding or hydrolysis, may nevertheless be important in a coupled downstream event, such as RNA binding and duplex unwinding (Tolskaya et al., 1994) , as described above for some of the superfamily 2 helicases. However, the 2C ATPase activity was not stimulated (Mirzayan and Wimmer, 1994a) , or modestly stimulated (twofold) (Rodriguez and Carrasco, 1993) , by addition of RNA, although the 2C protein contains a consensus dsRNA-binding sequence (Paul et al., 1994b) . Hence, if the 2C protein is a helicase, it differs from the superfamily 2 helicases described above, although the possibility that the (putative) 2C helicase activity requires interaction with another viral or cellular protein for interaction with RNA and unwinding activity cannot be discounted. It is also noteworthy that the poliovirus 3Dp\"' protein has an unwinding (strand-displacement activity) (Cho et al., 1993) , as described in Section I. Although none of these experiments rules out the hypothesis that the 2C protein is a helicase with a role in the initiation of RNAreplication, the possibility arises that ATP hydrolysis might be coupled to some other function of the 2C protein, such as virion uncoating Baltimore, 1988, 1990) , encapsidation of viral RNA, or membrane trafficking (both of which are likely to be important in RNA replication), as suggested by Mirzayan and Wimmer (1994a) .",

Its N-terminal half contains sequence motifs characteristic of the helicase superfamily 1 (rubi lineage, Table 11 ) and a mutant with a C-Y mutation at residue 304 between motifs IV and V was temperaturesensitive for subgenomic RNA synthesis (Hahn et al., 198913) . The nsP2 protein when expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with a short N-terminal addition containing a histidine tag was found to have ATP and GTP binding activity, ATPase and GTPase activity further stimulated by the presence of ssRNA, and RNA binding capacity. Similar activities were found with a truncated nsP2 protein containing the N-terminal470 amino acid residues, which contained the helicase-like motifs but lacked the C-terminal protease domain. A mutant nsP2 protein in which the conserved lysine residue of motif I was replaced by asparagine exhibited no ATPase or GTPase activity. By analogy with the superfamily 2 and 3 NTPases discussed above, it is likely that this residue functions in NTP binding. It is likely that the NTPase activity of the nsP2 protein is coupled in some way to its function in RNA synthesis, but attempts to demonstrate helicase activity in the E. coliexpressed fusion protein were unsuccessful. As discussed for the poliovirus 2C protein, it is possible that interaction with another viral or host protein is needed for helicase activity.",

There was also complete correspondence between the polymerase and helicase lineages of these viruses. This probably indicates coevolution and a long-standing association of the polymerase-like and helicaselike genes of these viruses, some of which have animal hosts and others plant hosts, and which constitute the alpha-like (Sindbis-like) virus supergroup (Goldbach and de Haan, 1994) . Similarly, the supergroup 1 RNA polymerases of the picorna lineage were found in animal and plant viruses with superfamily 3 helicase-like proteins (Table 11) , again indicating likely coevolution of these genes. However, plant viruses with supergroup 1 RNA polymerases of the poty lineage and animal viruses with supergroup 2 polymerases of the flavi and pesti lineages both had helicase-like proteins of superfamily 2 (Table 11 ) (Lain et al., 1989) . This could indicate creation of new combinations of polymerase and helicase genes in the evolution of these viruses. The coronaviruses, toroviruses, and arteriviruses, which are somewhat divergent from other positive-stranded RNA viruses, contain a unique combination of supergroup 1 polymerases and superfamily 1 helicase-like proteins. As helicase activity has as yet only been demonstrated for positivestranded RNA viruses of the helicase superfamily 2 and the role of such activities in the replication of the viruses concerned has yet to be confirmed, it is premature to speculate as to what extent the sequences which define the different helicase superfamilies are reflected in any significant differences in their activities or roles in RNA replication.",

            "text": "Different basic models have been proposed for the replication of positive-stranded RNA viruses, which involve intermediates with different structures and which have implications for the involvement of helicases in the replication process. Three models are shown in Fig. 1 . In model 1, the RdRp recognizes a promoter a t the 3' end of the positive-strand RNA template (a) and starts to synthesize a complementary negative strand. The nascent negative strand only remains base-paired to the positive strand in the region where the polymerase binds to the template and is actively synthesizing RNA. The 5' tail of the nascent negative strand is not base-paired to the template; hence most of the replicative intermediate (b) is in a single-stranded form. Continuation of the reaction leads to the formation of a free negative strand product (c), and releases the positive-strand template. The polymerase then recognizes a promoter at the 3' end of the negative strand and, using the negative strand a s a template, starts to synthesize a progeny positive strand, giving a second type of replicative intermediate (d). As before, the nascent strand is only base-paired to the template in the region of the active site of the polymerase where RNA synthesis is taking place, so that this replicative intermediate is also mainly single-stranded, Before the synthesis of the first progeny positive strand has been completed, initiation of synthesis of further positive strands takes place, giving a replicative intermediate consisting of a full-length negative-stranded template, to which are attached several nascent positive strands which again are largely in a single-stranded form (e). The process continues to synthesize and release multiple copies of the progeny positive-stranded RNA (@ The first stage of model 2 is essentially the same as that of model 1, except that the negative strand formed remains base-paired with the positive-stranded template, giving a replicative intermediate (b), consisting of partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded structure. The reaction continues to give a fully double-stranded RNA (replicative form) (c). In this model, no free negative strand is synthesized. The polymerase then recognizes a promoter at the end of the replicative form dsRNA containing the 3' end of the negative strand and the 5' end of the positive strand. Synthesis of progeny positivestranded RNA commences using the negative strand as a template by a strand-displacement mechanism, giving rise to replicative intermediates consisting of double-stranded RNA with one (d), or following reinitiations several (e), single-stranded 5' tails of the full-length posi-tive strands. The first full-length positive strand to be released from the replicative intermediate will be the original template strand (a); continued reaction will then result in the synthesis and release of multiple progeny positive strands (0. The formation of the double-stranded replicative form RNA in model 3 is exactly the same as in model 2. However, synthesis of progeny positive-stranded RNA using the negative strand of the dsRNA only displaces the positive strand of the dsRNA transiently in the region where RNA synthesis is taking place. The replicative intermediates formed (d, e) consist of double-stranded RNA with one or several single-stranded tails, but unlike the replicative intermediates in model 2 (d, e) in which the single-stranded tails are the displaced 5' tails of full-length positive strands, these singlestranded tails belong to the nascent, incomplete progeny positive strands. The synthesis of progeny positive strands from a dsRNA replicative form RNA in model 2 is analogous to the semiconservative transcription of dsRNA by strand displacement characteristic of dsRNA viruses of the Birnauiridae, Cystoviridae, and Partitiviridae families (Buck, 1979; van Etten et al., 1980; Dobos and Roberts, 1983) , whereas that in model 3 is analogous to conservative transcription of dsRNA characteristic of dsRNA viruses of the Reoviridae and Totiviridae families (Shatkin and Kozak, 1983; Fujimura and Wickner, 1989) .",

Double-stranded RNAs (usually called replicative form or RF dsRNAs) are usually found in nucleic preparations from cells infected with positive-strand RNA viruses or in the extracted products of in vitro RNA synthesis reactions with crude or partially purified polymerase preparations from infected plants or animal cells (de Graaf and Jaspars, 1994) , irrespective of the polymerase or helicase type. Double-stranded RNA could arise in uiuo a s dcad-end products formed by annealing of positive and negative strands; even i n the case of &a, for which model 1 (Fig. 1) is well established, clsRNA accumulates a s the concentrations of viral RNAs in the cell increase (Priano et al., 1987) . Furthermore, annealing of positive and negative strands can also occur on extraction of nucleic acids from cells by deproteinization. Similar considerations apply to the different types of replicative intermediates. The \"closed\" intermediates ( Fig. 1 , model 2, d, e) could be formed by collapse of the \"open\" intermediates ( Fig. 1 , model 1, d, e). dsRNAs extracted from in uitro RNA synthesis reactions could be formed in the same way, or could result from inadequacies in the in uitro systems. Many in uitro template-dependent systems synthesize only negative-stranded RNA, indicating a lack of one or more essential components (or the presence of an inhibitor).",

            "text": "Isolated poliovirus replicative intermediates consist of a full-length negative-strand template to which are attached six to eight nascent positive strands, but conflicting evidence has been presented that such intermediates have either an \"open,\" mainly single-stranded structure (Oberg and Philipson, 1971; Richards et al., 1984; Bienz et ab., 1994) or a \"closed\" structurc (Meyer et al., 1978; Nilsen et al., 1981; . Using electron microscopy and other techniques, Garnier et al. (1980) showed that the turnip yellow mosaic virus replicative intermediates formed in uiuo were mainly in the single-stranded form and considered that the dsRNA isolated from infected leaves was mainly a n isolation artifact, although some dsRNA may be formed in uiuo late in infection. Using a n in uitro system able to catalyze the complete replication of cucumber mosaic virus RNA, Hayes and Buck (1990) detected free positive and negative strands in the ratio of 7:1, as well a s some dsRNA, suggesting that replication occurred according to model 1 and showing that some free negative strands could survive the phenol extraction procedure in the presence of a n excess of positive strands. DsRNA was not a template for the replicase complex (Hayes and Buck, 1993) , but this could merely indicate that the replicase lacked an essential component required to initiate synthesis on a dsRNA template. Evidence was obtained that flavivirus RNA positive-strand RNA molecules are synthesized from negativc-strand templates by a semiconservative mechanism, a s in model 2 ( Fig. 1 ) (Chu and Westaway, 1985; Cleaves et al., 1981) . Wu and Kaesberg (1991) , using a flockhouse virus template-dependent in uitro RNA replication system, showed that labelled nucleotides incorporated into dsRNA during a short pulse could be chased into ssRNA using excess unlabelled nucleotides, sug-gesting \"closed\" replication intermediates (Fig. 1, model 2 ) . Although free negative-stranded RNA has generally not been isolated from eukaryotic cells infected with positive-stranded RNA viruses, replication of flockhouse virus RNA 2 could be initiated from a negativestranded template in cells in which replication proteins were provided in trans (Ball, 1994) . Furthermore, an isolated cucumber mosaic virus RdRp complex was capable of replicating a satellite RNA when provided with the negative-strand satellite RNA (Wu and Kaper, 1994) , a n isolated brome mosaic virus RdRp complex could use negative-strand templates to produce subgenomic RNA (Dreher and Hall, 1988) , and a n isolated alfalfa mosaic virus RdRp could use a negative-strand template to produce full-length and subgenomic RNA (de Graaf et al., 1995a,b) . However, attempts to use negative strands for the replication of alphaviruses were not successful (reviewed by Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . Finally, some evidence for the formation of double-stranded replication intermediates comes from the observation that transgenic plants expressing a yeast double-stranded RNA-specific ribonuclease showed resistance (albeit incomplete) to tomato mosaic virus, cucumber mosaic virus, and potato virus Y (Watanabe et al., 1995) . In model 1, it would be anticipated that the short double-stranded regions where the nascent transcript is bound to the template would be protected by the replicase complex and hence not accessible to the dsRNA ribonuclease.",

Generally, the available evidence does not allow the \"open\" and \"closed\" models (models 1 and 2) to be distinguished unequivocally for any eukaryotic positive-stranded RNA virus and further work is needed in this area. It is possible that different mechanisms operate for different viruses or groups of viruses. This could be related to different mechanisms for the initiation of positive-stranded RNA synthesis and to the requirement for some viruses to synthesize subgenomic RNAs. For example, viruses that initiate with a VPg may employ a different mechanism than those that are capped. Model 2 requires that the double-stranded replicative form RNA is unwound at the end containing the 3' terminus of the negative strand before synthesis can begin. Most RNA helicases, including the cellular and viral helicases discussed above, and most DNA helicases (Kornberg and Baker, 1992) bind to single-stranded regions adjacent to the duplex region to be unwound, and do not act on completely double-stranded structures.",

            "text": "Unwinding of a completely double-stranded RF could therefore involve another protein. Conversion of the E. coli replication origin to a n open structure requires the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, the dnaA protein (Bramhill and Kornberg, 1988) . Further unwinding of the duplexes as DNA synthesis proceeds a t the replication forks utilizes helicases. In the case of positive-stranded RNA replication, a 3'+5' helicase bound to the negative template strand of the unwound origin (promoter) could perform the subsequent duplex unwinding. The plum pox and bovine diarrhea virus helicases Warrener and Collett, 1995) have the required strand-displacement activity, as does the poliovirus 3DP\"' protein (Cho et al., 1993) and a n alfalfa mosaic virus RdRp complex (de Graaf et al., 1995a) . Model 2 requires recognition of a double-stranded structure for initiation of positive-strand synthesis (and for subgenomic RNA synthesis for those viruses that utilize subgenomic promoters), whereas model 1 requires recognition of a single-stranded structure. Since secondary structure in the singlestranded RNA appears to be important for recognition of at least some genomic and subgenomic promoters (see Section V,D), model 1 would appear to be favored in this aspect. Model 1 requires a n explanation, not required for model 2, as to how the base pairs formed at RNA synthesis are almost immediately unwound by the replicase complex. This could probably be accomplished by a helix-destabilizing protein, or a second molecule of the helicase, suitably positioned in the replicase complex. In this respect, it is noteworthy that purified replication complexes of cucumber mosaic virus (Hayes and Buck, 1990 ) and brome mosaic virus (Quadt et al., 1993) appear to contain more of the respective l a protein (which contains the helicase-like domain) than the 2a protein (which contains the polymerase-like domain), and brome mosaic virus RNA virus replication was found to be more sensitive to reductions in the expression of the l a protein than to reductions in the expression of the 2a protein (Kroner et al., 1990; Traynor and Ahlquist, 1990; Dinant et al., 1993) . It should be noted, however, that the l a protein also has capping functions (see Section I1,Cj.",

            "text": "The different replication models also have some implications for RNA recombination. There is good evidence that, at least in some cases, RNA recombination leading to the formation of viable recombinants or DI RNAs requires RNA replication (reviewed by Lai, 1992; Bujarski et al., 1994; Simon and Bujarski, 1994) . The favored mechanism, called \"copy choice,\" requires the polymerase, together with the nascent strand, to switch from one template (the donor) to another template (the recipient), either after first dissociating from the donor template (nonprocessive model) or in a processive fashion without first dissociating. Recombination can occur during negative-strand synthesis, as for poliovirus (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986) , brome mosaic virus , and flockhouse virus (Li and Ball, 1993) , or during positive-strand synthesis, as for turnip crinkle virus (Carpenter et al., 1995) . In replication model 2 ( Fig. 1) in the negativestrand-synthesizing replicative intermediate @) and the positivestrand-synthesizing replicative intermediate (d, e) , the nascent strand remains completely base-paired to its template. This would appear to make it more difficult, in the nonprocessive model, for the polymerase and nascent strand to dissociate from the template or, in the processive model, could create a structure in which the newly synthesized recombinant strand is base-paired to both donor and recipient templates. The problem would be overcome if a second RdRp complex were advancing along the template close behind, carrying out displacement synthesis. If a second polymerase complex \"caught up\" with a paused complex, the resulting change of structure could facilitate detachment or strand switching, depending on the type of recombination event. Some processive models of recombination require the recipient template strand to be base-paired to the donor template strand in front of the advancing replicase. This would appear to present a problem in replication model 2 for recombination occurring during positive-strand synthesis, unless the recipient template were able to specifically invade the unwound RNA where RNA synthesis is taking place. This problem would not occur with any of the models of RNA replication for recombination taking place during negative-strand synthesis.",

The simplest cap structure (cap 0) consists of 7MeGpppN, where N is usually A or G. The cap 1 and cap 2 structures are 7MeGpppNmpN' and 7MeGpppNmpN'm, where m represents methylation of the 2'-OH group of the ribose moiety of the nucleoside. Capping of the cellular mRNAs and those of most DNA viruses, retroviruses, and pararetroviruses occurs in the nucleus using cellular capping enzymes; capping of influenza virus mRNAs also occurs in the nucleus and involves endonucleolytic cleavage of capped oligonucleotides from cellular mRNAs for use as primers in transcription of the negative-stranded RNA genome. Capping of mRNAs of some other negative-stranded RNA viruses, such as the rhabdoviruses, and of dsRNA viruses and positive-stranded RNA viruses that possess a cap, and of some DNA viruses, such as the pox viruses, occurs in the cytoplasm, and utilizes virus-encoded enzymes (Mizumoto and Kaziro, 1987; Murphy et al., 1995) .

For mRNAs that contain a cap 1 or cap 2 structure, further methylation of the 2'-OH groups of the ribose moieties of N and N' is carried out using specific methyltransferases. It has been shown that for reovirus mRNAs, which have a cap 1 structure, capping is coupled to, and occurs at a n early stage of, mRNA synthesis (Furiuchi et al., 1976) .",

The Sindbis virus enzymes, as well as a n enzyme preparation from Sindbis virus-infected cells, were able to catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from AdoMet to GTP, dGTP and GpppG, but not to 7MeGTP, GpppA, or in uitro transcribed RNAs with GpppA or GpppG caps.

It therefore appears that the nsP1 protein has both capping and methylation activities, but that, unlike the cellular and viral capping reactions discussed above, the GTP is first converted to 7MeGTP by the methylase and then the 7MeGTP reacts with the guanylyltransferase to form a guanylyltransferase-7MeGMP complex, which in turn transfers the 7MeGMP to the ppNpN' ..... 5' end of the nascent RNA.",

Certain mutations in the l a protein which blocked virus RNA replication or made replication temperature-sensitive also prevented or made temperaturesensitive, respectively, the interaction between the l a and 2a proteins, suggesting that this interaction is required for BMV RNA replication (Kao et al., 1992) . The region of interaction has been mapped to the N-terminal 115 amino acids of the 2a protein and the helicase-like domain of more than 50 kDa of the l a protein (Kao and O'Reilly et al., 1995) . Mutational analysis has shown that the N-terminal region of the 2a protein, which lies upstream of the conserved polymerase-like domain, is essential for virus RNA replication (Traynor et al., 1991) . Requirement of the large size of the helicase-like domain of the l a protein for the interaction suggested involvement of a higherorder structure and it was shown that this domain, and analogous domains of three other viruses in the Bromoviridae family [alfalfa mosaic virus, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), CMVj, folded into protease-resistant structures; mutations which rendered the region protease-sensitive were defective in RNA replication (O'Reilly et al., 1995) . The BMV l a protein is homologous to the TMV 126-kDa protein and the BMV la-2a protein complex is homologous in structure to the TMV 183-kDa protein. The homologous proteins may serve similar functions in the replication complexes of the two viruses. Using different combinations of the l a and 2a proteins of BMV and CMV expressed transiently in plant protoplasts to support replication of BMV or CCMV RNA 3 templates, Dinant et at. (1993) found that the combination of CCMV l a and BMV 2a did not support detectable synthesis of negative-strand, positive-strand, or subgenomic RNA, whereas the combination of BMV l a and CCMV 2a was preferentially defective in positive-strand and subgenomic RNA accumulation, and negativestrand RNA was only slightly affected. The latter combination suggested that partial incompatibility of la-2a can distinguish some aspect of negative-stranded and positive-stranded RNA synthesis (including synthesis of subgenomic RNA), possibly the capping function of the l a protein, since only positive-stranded RNAs are capped. Isolation of replication complexes from yeast expressing the l a and 2a proteins has shown that the replication complexes, which probably contain host and viral proteins (see Section 111), can only form in the presence of an RNA template (Quadt et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "A different strategy is used by animal viruses of the Togaviridae family Frey, 1994) , which are the only enveloped viruses in the alpha-like virus supergroup. The viruses of the Atphauirus genus are the best studied. The nonstructural proteins are encoded a t the 5' end of the genome and are translated as a polyprotein which is cleaved by virus-encoded proteinase activity. The structural proteins (the capsid and envelope proteins) are encoded at the 3' end of the genome and are translated from a subgenomic RNA (26s RNA) as a polyprotein, which is cleaved by virus and host proteinases. Only the nonstructural proteins are required for RNA replication. Translation of Sindbis virus RNA gives a polyprotein P123, containing the sequences of nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3. Readthrough of a n opal termination codon (UGA), which is followed by a n essential (C), results in the production of P1234. The readthrough rate in translation in uitro was found to be 10-2096 at 30\u00b0C and <5% a t 40\u00b0C. Since nsPl is associated with methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase (see Section TI,C), nsP2 has a helicase-like domain (see Section I1,B) and nsP4 has a polymerase-like domain (see Section II,A), the relationship between P123 and P1234 is similar to that of the TMV 126-kDa and 183-kDa proteins. However, unlike the TMV proteins, there is a domain for a papain-like cysteine proteinase near the C terminus of nsP2. The specificity of nsP2 is modulated by the surrounding sequences, so that the pattern of cleavage of the polyproteins changes through the replication cycle (reviewed by Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . In P1234, the proteinase can cleave in cis between nsP3 and nsP4 to give P123 and nsP4. The cleavage site is six amino acid residues downstream of the opal terminal codon, but as the C-terminal region of nsP3 is variable and deletions in it are well tolerated (Lastarza et al., 1994b) , P123 formed by primary translation and P123 formed by cleavage of P1234 are considered equivalent. P123 cannot be cleaved in cis, but once sufficient concentrations have built up, it is cleaved in trans to produce nsPl and P23. The P23 proteinase can cleave the P21P3 site in polyproteins (including itself) very efficiently, and nsP2 and nsP3 are produced. The P3/P4 site can only be cleaved by nsP2 polyproteins containing nsP3 sequences. Late in infection it is likely that that the P2/P3 site is cleaved (in trans) in the nascent polypeptide; hence the P31P4 site is not cleaved and the main products are nsP1, nsP2, and P34, but the proteins produced late in infection are not thought to be involved in replication.",

However, mutations which inactivated the nsP2 proteinase and resulted in uncleaved P123 led to increased accumulation of negativestranded RNA and decreased accumulation of positive-stranded genomic and subgenomic RNAs. Another mutation which greatly increased the rate of cleavage of P123 was lethal. These results, together with further mutational analysis, led to the proposal that P123 + nsP4 function in negative-stranded RNA synthesis (Shirako and Strauss, 1994; Lemm et al., 1994) . However, it is likely that nsPl + P23 + nsP4 can also function in negative-stranded RNA synthesis, since temperaturesensitive mutations with lesions in nsPl and nsP3 complement, whereas those in nsP2 and nsP3 do not rescue defects in negative-stranded RNA synthesis Lastarza et al., 1994a; .

            "text": "Although polyprotein processing is common in the expression of viral genes (Dougherty and Semler, 1993) , it is relatively uncommon in the alpha-like virus superfamily. In the case of the alphaviruses, and probably also rubella virus (Frey, 1994) , it may have evolved as a method of inducing conformational changes in replication complexes to switch from negative-strand to positive-strand synthesis. After cleavage, all four proteins remain in association because they are found in isolated replication complexes (Barton et al., 1991) , although their relative juxtapositions may alter. All the nonstructural alphavirus proteins are multifunctional and have functions in both negativestrand and positive-strand synthesis, which have been distinguished by mutational analysis (reviewed in Strauss and Strauss, 1994) . The nsPl protein functions as a guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase in the capping of positive-stranded RNA (see Section II,C), it is required for negative-strand synthesis and in polyproteins it modulates the proteinase activity of the nsP2 protein by inhibiting cleavage of the site between nsP2 and nsP3. The nsP2 protein has a n Nterminal helicase domain (see Section I1,B) and a C-terminal proteinase domain; it is specifically required for the synthesis of subgenomic RNA and plays a role in the conversion of negative-strand-synthesizing to positive-strand-synthesizing enzymes (Di! et al., 1996) . The nsP3 protein has separate functions in negative-stranded RNA and subgenomic RNA synthesis (Lastarza et al., 1994a; Wang et al., 1994) , some of which may be host-specific (Lastarza et al., 1994b) . Its presence in polyproteins modulates the activity of the nsP2 proteinase (see above). The nsP4 protein is likely to be the RNA polymerase that functions in negative-stranded, positive-stranded, and subgenomic RNA synthesis. Presumably all these proteins must also contain domains that keep them associated after proteolytic cleavage. The Nterminal region of the nsP4 protein is thought to be important for this purpose. Another possibility is that complete cleavage of the polyprotein could enable an additional copy of an individual subunit, such as the nsP2 protein which contains the helicase-like domain, to be recruited for a specific function in the synthesis of positive-stranded RNA, which was not needed for negative-stranded RNA synthesis.",

ORF 1 encodes a 206-kDa protein which contains methyltransferase-like, helicase-like, and polymeraselike domains. ORF 2 encodes a cell-to-cell movement protein and ORF 3 encodes the coat protein, which is translated from a subgenomic RNA; neither of these proteins is required for RNA replication. The 206-kDa primary i n vitro translation product is cleaved in cis by a papain-like cysteine proteinase, located between the methyltransferase-like and helicase-like domains, to give a protein of 66 kDa from the C-terminal end (which contains the polymerase-like domain) and a protein of 140 kDa from the N-terminal end, which contains the other three domains (Bransom et al., 1991; Bransom and Dreher, 1994; Kadari! et al., 1995) . The proteinase was active and cleaved the same site when expressed in E. coli (Kadarit et al., 1995) Although this cleavage is needed for virus RNA replication (Weiland and Dreher, 1993 ), its precise function has not been determined.

It may be speculated that this could reflect some basic common structural feature in the organization of the replicase complex, particularly as the three domains can apparently function in one protein in some viruses, e.g., potato virus X. However, a single replication protein is not sufficient for tobacco mosaic virus replication. A tobacco mosaic virus mutant, engineered to remove the stop codon at the end of the ORF for the 126-kDa protein so that only the 183-kDa protein was produced, replicated poorly and the stop codon was reintroduced by reversion (Ishikawa et al., 1986) . The stop codon near the end of nsP3 in Sindbis virus, however, is not essential. Some alphaviruses, such as Semliki Forest virus, do not have the stop codon, so that the only primary translation product is P1234. It has been suggested that the extra amount of P123 produced when the stop codon is present provides extra proteinase to accelerate the switch from negative-strand to positive-strand synthesis . The phenotype of Sindbis virus mutants in which the stop codon had been replaced by a sense codon (Li and Rice, 1989) were consistent with this hypothesis, It is noteworthy that there is no apparent counterpart of the alphavirus nsP3 protein in the plant alpha-like viruses. This protein has functions distinct from its effect on nsP2 proteinase specificity, perhaps in protein folding or protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions, which must be circumvented or achieved in different ways in the plant virus replication complexes. Switches in functions to achieve synthesis of negative-stranded, positive-stranded, or subgenomic RNA may perhaps be achieved by a variety of methods, including proteolytic cleavage, protein-protein interactions, protein-RNA interactions, modification of proteins, for instance by phosphorylation, or changes in the stoichiometry of the different components in replication complexes. Further studies will be required to determine whether or not the considerable diversity in expression of replicase functions within the alpha-like supergroup merely reflects variations on a common theme.",

One of the functions of these proteins is to regulate the synthesis of the capsid protein, which in these viruses is encoded by 5'-proximal genes. Although these proteins are not absolute requirements for RNAreplication, they have been shown to affect replication in some instances. Beet necrotic yellow vein virus has four RNA components. RNA 1 can replicate alone in protoplasts and contains a long ORF containing methyltransferase-like, helicase-like, and polymeraselike functions (Richards and Tamada, 1992) . RNA 2 has several ORFs, including the coat protein gene a t the 5' end and a gene for a small cysteine-rich protein (P14) at the 3' end. Null mutations in P14 not only reduced coat protein accumulation, but also had a specific inhibitory effect on RNA 2 accumulation (Hehn et al., 1995) . The defect in RNA 2 accumulation could not be complemented in trans, which is surprising since it is expressed a s a single protein via a subgenomic RNA, and the defect in coat protein accumulation could be complemented in trans; it was suggested that translation of P14 and replication of RNA 2 were tightly coupled.",

Readthrough of a stop codon at the end of this ORF (carmoviruses, necroviruses, and tombusviruses), or a ribosomal frameshift prior to the stop codon (dianthoviruses and subgroup I luteoviruses), gives rise to a fusion protein (82-99 kDa). The C-terminal region of the fusion protein contains a polymerase-like domain. Mutants of' cymbidium ringspot virus, red clover necrotic mosaic virus, tomato bushy stunt virus, and turnip crinkle virus which produce only the smaller protein, or only the fusion protein, failed to replicate Dalmay et al., 1993a; Gieseman-Cookmeyer et al., 1995; White et al., 1995) , indicating that both proteins are required for RNA replication. For cymbidium ringspot virus and barley yellow dwarf virus-PAY it was shown that the 5'-encoded protein and the readthrough or frameshift protein were the only virus-encoded proteins needed for RNA replication (Kollar and Burgyan, 1994; Mohan et al., 1995) . It was also shown that when these two proteins were expressed in transgenic plants from chromosomal insertions of the genes, replication of DI RNAs was supported. Furthermore, nonviable mutants of turnip crinkle virus with mutations in either the gene for the 28-kDa protein or the 88-kDa readthrough protein could complement each other (White et al., 1995) . These two experiments show that the two replication proteins act in trans. A purified RdRp complex isolated from plants infected with red clover necrotic mosaic virus was shown to contain both the 27-kDa protein and the 88-kDa frameshift fusion protein (Bates et al., 1995) . The function of the smaller replication protein, which is produced in a large excess over the fusion protein, is not known. It could be a helix-destabilizing protein which substitutes for the apparent absence of a helicase-like domain in these viruses. Evidence also suggests that it is involved in membrane localization of the replicase complex (see Section IV). RNAs of viruses in the carmolike supergroup are capped and presumable capping enzymes are encoded by one or both of the essential ORFs, although no sequence similarity to capping enzymes of the alpha-like viruses has been detected. The other proteins encoded by these viruses, which are not needed for replication, are translated from subgenomic RNAs or additionally in the case of the dianthoviruses, from an additional RNA segment.",

The genome map of poliovirus may he divided into three regions, P1, P2, and P3. P1 encodes the virus capsid proteins and P2 and P3 encode the nonstructural proteins. The order of the genome is (N terminus to C terminus) lA-lB-lC-lD-2A-2B-2C-3A-3B(=VPg)-3C-3D. Translation starts at an initiation site several hundred nucleotides from the 5' end and continues until a stop codon is reached in the 3'-terminal region. Theoretically, a polyprotein of 2209 amino acids could be produced, but this is partially cleaved while still nascent by proteinases present within the polyprotein, which probably act in cis. The first cleavage is mediated by 2A, a chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase, which cleaves a YG linkage between the P1 and P2 regions. Once the 3C region, which encodes another chymotrypsin-like proteinase specific for QG linkages, has been translated, further cleavages can occur. Many intermediates are formed, some of which have functions distinct from the completely cleaved products. Most subsequent cleavages are mediated by 2APm, 3CD\"\", and, to a lesser extent, 3CPr\". Many of the partly or completely cleaved products have roles in RNA replication and interact at different stages of replication. The product 2Apru is a multifunctional protein which has functions in replication which are distinct from its functions as a proteinase (cleavage of poliovirus polyprotein, inhibition of host protein synthesis) and as a n enhancer of poliovirus translation Lu et al., 1995) . Protein 2B (or its precursor 2BC) may be required in cis during assembly of the replication complex, because RNA-negative 2B mutants are noncomplementable (Johnson and Sarnow, 1991; van Kuppeveld et al., 1995) . The NTPase and putative helicase function of the 2C protein was discussed in Section I1,B. The 3AB protein is the precursor of VPg (3B). 3AB has also been shown to stimulate the activity of the polymerase (3Dl'\"') in catalyzing RNA synthesis on various primed templates by up to 100fold, possibly because of its ability to bind both the template-primer and 3DP\"' (Lama et al., 1994; Paul et al., 1994a; Plotch and Palant, 1995) . 3AB also forms a complex with 3CDP' \" (which has no polymerase activity), resulting in accelerated autoprocessing of 3CDP\" to form 3CP\" and the active polymerase 3D'\"'1 (Molla et al., 1994) . The 3AB-CD\"\" complex was found to form a complex with a cloverleaf structure at the 5' terminus of poliovirus RNA and formation of the complex was essential for RNAreplication Xiang et al., 1995a,b) . 3AB or 3CDP' O alone did not bind to the cloverleaf. The 3AB-CDPro complex, or 3AB alone, formed a complex with the 3'-terminal sequence of poliovirus. These observations led Harris et al. (1994) to propose a model for poliovirus RNA replication. Initiation of negative-strand synthesis using VPg-pU as a primer occurs following formation of a 3AB-3CDPro complex at the 3' end of poliovirus RNA, cleavage of 3CDPr0, and formation of [3AB-D]\"PerP0'. After negative-strand synthesis to form a doublestranded duplex, the end of the duplex is unwound, possibly by the putative 2C helicase, allowing formation of the 3AB-3CDPro-cloverleaf complex and initiation of positive-strand synthesis by [3AB-3D]\"PerPo' on the free 3' end of the negative-stranded RNA. The multiplicity of functions of precursors and fully cleaved proteins, combined with the formation of functional complexes and their membrane locations (see Section IV), may lead to explanations of why some mutations, for instance in 3A or 3DP\"', are complementable and others are not. Evidence has been obtained that poliovirus translation and replication are coupled, probably in the early stages of replication (Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994) ; such coupling could be required for the assembly of new replication complexes. Complete replication of poliovirus has been achieved in uitro using a combined translation and replication system (Molla et al., 1991) .",

The 58K protein contains the helicase-like domain. The 87K protein contains a polymerase-like domain like that in poliovirus 3DP\"' , but the active form, detected in isolated replication complexes, appears to be the 110K precursor (24K-87K) (Dorssers et al., 1984) . This represents a significant difference from poliovirus, because 3CDPr0 has no polymerase activity. VPg is probably involved in initiation of RNA synthesis (see Section II,D), but its mode of processing may be different from that in poliovirus. In the latest model, it is suggested that initiation may involve cleavage of the 112K polymerase precursor (VPg-24K-87K) (Peters et al., 1995) , although in a crude RNA polymerase preparation, the 60K precursor (58K-VPg) was the most prominent protein detected by anti-VPg serum (Eggen et al., 1988) .",

The polyprotein translation product is cleaved by three proteinases (Dougherty and Semler, 1993) . The P1 proteinase autocatalytically cleaves itself from the rest of the polyprotein. The HC-proteinase (HC-Pro) also autocatalytically deaves itself at its C terminus in a cotranslational event. The remainder of the cleavages are carried out by the Nla proteinase, which has similarities with the picornavirus and comovirus proteinases. Like the picornavirus proteins, potyvirus proteins are multifunctional and several function in RNA replication (Riechmann et aE., 1992) . The NIb protein contains the RNA polymeraselike domain. Mutants in the NIb region could be complemented by wild-type NIb protein expressed in transgenic plants with efficiencies varying from 1% to 100% (Li and Carrington, 1995) . VPg constitutes the N-terminal region of the NIa proteinase and both NIa and the cleaved VPg have been found linked to the 5' end of the viral RNA. A large proportion of the NIa and NIb proteins is found in the nucleus. A predominantly nuclear location was also found for the alphavirus nsP2 protein, but this is irrelevant for replication, since a proportion of the protein is localized to the cytoplasmic membranes where replication tales place (see Section IV). Localization of a proportion of the NIa and NIb proteins to the membranes where TEV RNA replication takes place may be mediated by the adjacent 6K protein, which has been shown to be essential for RNA replication (Restrepo-Hartwig and . 6K-VPg and 6K-NIa polyproteins were detected in extracts from infected plants, The 6K protein was shown to have a membrane location and may function in a similar way to the poliovirus 3A protein as a membrane anchor (see Section IV). The NIa and NIb proteins have been shown to interact in yeast cells (Hong et al., 1995) . The CI helicase was described in Section I1,B. The CI, NIb, and NIb-NIa proteins have been detected in polymerase preparations from infected plants . HC-Pro also has a n essential role in RNA replication, which requires its cleavage activity (Kasschau and Carrington, 1995) . The P1 protein has RNA-binding activities (Soumounou and Laliberte, 1994) and has a stimulatory effect on RNA replication (Verchot and Carrington, 1995) .",

The latter ranges in size from 345 kDa (arteriviruses) up to 800 kDa (coronaviruses) (Snijder and Horzinek, 1993) . Polymerase-like and helicase-like domains are found in that order in the frameshift part of the polyprotein. Clearly, this order is different from that in the other virus supergroups and the location of the helicaselike domain in the frameshift portion is also unusual. The gene 1 polyprotein is broken down into functional products by virus-encoded proteinases, some of which are papain-like, another resembles the poliovirus 3C proteinase, and another has similarities to both types Snijder et al., 1995) .

CP genes have been replaced by other genes in a number of expression vectors derived from animal and plant positive-stranded RNA plant viruses, such as alphaviruses, bromoviruses, and tombusviruses (reviewed by Mushegian and Shepherd, 1995; Schlesinger, 1995) . In the absence of the capsid protein, levels of accumulation of positive-stranded RNA are sometimes reduced and this has been ascribed to degradation of the RNA in the absence of the protective capsid, e.g., in beet western yellows virus (Reutenauer et al., 1993) , cowpea mosaic virus (van Bokhoven et al., 1993) , and cucumber mosaic virus .",

            "text": "Plant viruses in the Alfamovirus and Ilarvirus genera of the Bromoviridae family appear to be exceptional in their requirement for CP in both early and late functions. Alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) has a tripartite genome, similar to that of brome mosaic virus. RNAs 1 and 2 encode the replication proteins P1 and P2 (equivalent to l a and 2 4 , whereas RNA 3 encodes the movement protein and the CP, the latter being translated from a subgenomic RNA. Unlike brome mosaic virus, plants cannot be infected by a mixture of RNA 1, RNAB, and RNA 3; infection requires additionally a small amount of CP or its subgenomic RNA, a process called genome activation (reviewed by . The 3' terminal 145 nt of the three RNAs are homologous and can be folded into a structure consisting of a series of stem-loops, separated by AUGC motifs, which contains a high affinity CP-binding site (site 1); an additional similar upstream binding site (site 2) is found in RNA 3 (Reusken et al., 1994; Houser-Scott et al., 1994) . Mutations in two of the AUGC motifs in binding site 1 of RNA 3 reduced or abolished binding. The RNA-binding site is located near the N terminus of the CP and one or more lysine residues in this region are needed for gene activation (Raer et al., 1994; Yusibov and Loesch-Fries, 1995) . When RNA 3 was used to inoculate transgenic plants expressing P1 and P2 from chromosomal expression cassettes (P12 plants), replication of RNA 3 was achieved in the absence of CP in the inoculum (Neeleman et al., 1993) . It was suggested that the role ofthe CP in gene activation may be to stabilize the RNAs in the inoculum to allow translation of the replicase genes and the formation of a replicase complex to occur.",

This was unlikely to be due to stabilization of the RNA by encapsidation because, using infections with chimeric AlMV-tobacco streak ilarvirus (TSV) constructs, it was found that the CP of TSV could encapsidate AlMV RNA, but not stimulate positive-strand synthesis (Reusken et al., 1995) . Further analysis indicated that some AlMV CP mutations affected the early (gene activa-tion) and late (asymmetric positive-strand accumulation) functions in a quantitatively different way and that AUGC motif mutations that abolished CP binding reduced positive-strand but not negative-strand accumulation (van der Vossen et at., 1994). detected CP in a purified RdRp preparation from AlMV-infected plants, in addition to P1 and P2. De Graaf et al. (199513) showed that synthesis of full-length and subgenomic positive-stranded RNA on a negative-strand AlMV RNA 3 template by an RdRp preparation isolated from P12 plants was strongly stimulated by addition of CP and suggested that this stimulation could explain both gene activation and asymmetric positive-strand accumulation.",

Generally it has been found that replication in single cells (protoplasts) is not affected when the movement protein gene is deleted. However, two observations suggest that there may be a link between replication and virus movement in the plant. (1) Mutations in the C-terminal region of the 2a brome mosaic virus replication protein had no effect on replication in single cells, but were deleterious for virus spread in the plant (Traynor et al., 1991) . (2) Transgenic plants expressing a truncated cucumber mosaic virus 2a protein were resistant to infection by the virus. The major effect was on inhibition of RNA replication, but to a lesser extent virus spread in the plant was also affected (Carr et al., 1994) . It is therefore possible that there may be some interactions between replication complexes and the virus-encoded or host proteins that are involved in virus spread through the plant.",

The first involves purification of solubilized RdRp and searching for host proteins that copurify with the RdRp in multiple purification steps. Copurification of host proteins with RdRps has been found for several viruses, such as brome mosaic virus (BMV) (Quadt and Jaspars, 1990) , cowpea mosaic virus (Dorrsers et al., 1984) , cucumber mosaic virus (Hayes and Buck, 1990) , red clover necrotic mosaic virus (Bates et al., 1995) , Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses (Barton et al., 1991) , and turnip yellow mosaic virus (Mouches et al., 1984) . All such studies require further evidence that such copurification is not fortuitous. One of the host proteins that copurified with the BMV RdRp was identified as the barley analogue of the p41 subunit of the wheat germ eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-3, or a closely related protein (Quadt et al., 1993) . The BMV RdRp-associated host protein and the p41 subunit of wheatgerm eIF-3 were found to bind with high affinity and specificity to the BMV 2a polymerase-like protein. Addition of wheatgerm eIF-3 or its p41 subunit to the BMV RdRp gave a threefold stimulation of negative-strand synthesis. Biochemical functions of eIF-3 include stabilization of Met-tRNA, Met (ternary complex) binding to the 40s ribosomal subunit, mRNA binding to the ribosome, and dissociation of 80s ribosomes into 60s and 40s subunits, and it is thought to play a key role in assembly of the initiation complex (Merrick, 1992; Hannig, 1995) . The specific function in protein synthesis of the p41 subunit of wheatgerm eIF-3, which is composed of 10 subunits, is not known.",

            "text": "A complex of a cellular protein and the poliovirus 3CDPr0 protein was found to bind to the cloverleaf structure at the 5' end of poliovirus RNA (Andino et al., 1990) . The cloverleaf structure has been shown to be essential for virus RNA replication (Andino et al., 1993) and this domain functions independently from the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) required for translation (Rohll et al., 1994) . The cellular protein was identified as an N-terminal fragment of EF-la . The significance of this complex is not clear in view of the finding that a 3AB-3CDPro complex also binds to the clovercleaf (see Section II,E,4), although it has been found that mouse cells are temperaturesensitive for initiation of poliovirus positive-strand synthesis, implicating a host factor in this process (Shiroki et al., 1993) . A putative host factor, a 67-kDa phosphoprotein which possesses autophosphorylation activity and can phosphorylate the a-submit of eIF-2 i n uitro, has been shown to be able to function in the initiation of poliovirus negativestrand RNA synthesis in vitro (Morrow et al., 1985) . It has also been suggested that a terminal uridylyltransferase may act as a host factor in the initiation of poliovirus negative-strand synthesis by adding uridine residues to the 3' poly(A) end of virion RNA, which could anneal back to the poly(A) to form a hairpin primer for the polymerase (Andrews and Baltimore, 1986). dsRNA molecules joined at one end in a hairpin structure have been isolated from poliovirus-infected cells (Young et al., 1985) . A model was proposed in which VPg cleaved the hairpin and became covalently attached to the 5' UMP of the negative strand in a self-catalyzed transesterification reaction (Tobin et al., 1989) . Other models were suggested by Lubinski et al. (1986) . Good evidence for involvement of a host protein in poliovirus replication comes from the use of a combined i n vitro translation/replication system. Preinitiation complexes isolated after inhibiting the initiation of RNA synthesis with guanidine-HC1 were shown to require the addition of soluble cellular factors for initiation of RNA synthesis (Barton et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "A host protein may be involved in the resistance to tobacco mosaic virus conferred by the Tm-1 gene in tomato. Expression of this gene causes inhibition of RNA replication (Watanabe et al., 1987) and mutations in resistance-breaking strains of the virus map close to the helicase-like motif IV in the 126-kDa protein (Meshi et al., 1988) . A possible explanation is that the resistance gene could be a n allele of a gene encoding an essential host component of the replicase complex. The product of the resistance gene would be a mutant of this host protein, which may be unable to form a functional replicase. The resistancebreaking strains would contain compensating mutations to allow production of an active replicase. Host-specific alterations in brome mosaic virus RNA accumulation, dependent on RNA 1, have also been reported (de Jong and Ahlquist, 1995) . A recessive mutation tom1 in Arabidopsis thaliana reduced replication of tobacco mosaic virus RNA to low levels, suggesting that the product of the wild-type gene was required for replication (Ishikawa et al., 1993) . Studies of host-range mutants (Kowal and Stollar, 1981) and analysis of the effects of some cis-acting seqences of alphaviruses (Kuhn et al., 1992) also suggest a role of host factors in replication.",

Another study suggested that a host protein may negatively control production of a tobacco mosaic virus subgenomic RNA (Blum et al., 1989) . A new approach that should uncover host genes required for the replication of brome mosaic virus has been opened up by the demonstration that this virus can replicate in yeast cells . This opens up the powerful yeast genetic system for the creation of host mutants defective in virus RNA replication, and for the isolation of the genes involved. The ability of brome mosaic virus to replicate in yeast clearly depends on the ability of yeast proteins to substitute for plant proteins in the replication of the virus RNA and implies a degree of conservation. However, several animal and plant genes have been cloned by complementation in yeast, and yeast proteins can often substitute for mammalian proteins, e.g., yeast eIF-3 can substitute for the mammalian factor in a heterologous reconstituted in vitro assay system (Naranda et at., 1994) . The method may therefore be applicable to a range of animal and plant viruses.",

Isolated membrane complexes have been found to be capable of in vitro synthesis of replicative intermediates, elongation and release of genomic-length RNA, and in some cases, initiation of RNA synthesis on endogenous templates which remain bound to the replication complex. Examples include alpha-like virus supergroup, Sindbis virus (Barton et al., 1991) , alfalfa mosaic virus (de Graaf et al., 1993) , cucumber mosaic virus , foxtail mosaic virus (Rouleau et al., 1993) , tobacco mosaic virus (Young and Zaitlin, 1986) ; picorna-like virus supergroup, poliovirus (Takeda et al., 1986; Bienz et al., 1990) ; cowpea mosaic virus (Eggen et al., 1988) ; plum pox virus ; flavi-like virus supergroup, West Nile virus (Grun and Brinton, 1988) , Kunjin virus (Chu and Westaway, 1992) , dengue virus (Bartholomeusz and Wright, 1993); carmo-like virus supergroup, red clover necrotic mosaic virus (Bates et al., 1995) , turnip crinkle virus (Song and Simon, 1994) ; sobemo-like virus supergroup, velvet tobacco mottle virus (Rohozinski ct al., 1986) ; corona-like virus supergroup, mouse hepatitis virus (Brayton et al., 1982 (Brayton et al., , 1984 . In the case of flockhouse virus, it was possible to remove the bound RNA from the membrane-bound complex by nuclease digestion to produce a template-dependent RNA polymerase. Such preparations synthesized only negative-strand RNA (isolated a s dsRNA) with a genomic RNA template, but on addition of certain neutral or negatively charged phosphoglycerolipids (PGLs) both negative and positive strands were produced, giving complete replication of the genomic RNA (Wu and Kaesberg, 1991; Wu et al., 1992) . It was suggested that initiation of positive-strand synthesis may result from a direct GPL-replicase interaction, analogous to activation of the E. coli replication initiator protein dnaA by diphosphatidylglycerol (Sekimizu and Kornberg, 1988) , or a change in membrane configuration to mimic similar changes that may occur during replication in uiuo. Membranes also appear to be important for the replication of poliovirus RNA in a combined translation and replication system (Molla et al., 1991 (Molla et al., , 1993 Barton et aE., 1995) . For some other viruses it has been possible to produce templatedependent RNA polymerases after detergent solubilization and removal of the endogenous RNA (reviewed by de Graaf and Jaspars, 1994) . Generally, only the complementary strand has been synthesized by such preparations, although a solubilized polymerase able to catalyze the complete replication of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) RNA has been described (Hayes and Buck, 1990) . In uitro replication of CMV RNA in this system was, however, very inefficient with only a small fraction of the template being copied and the ratio of positive to negative strands much lower than that in vivo.",

Lysosomes, trans-Golgi, and the trans-Golgi network also contribute to the virus-induced membranous structures . Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of the cellular secretory pathway, inhibits poliovirus replication, possibly by preventing the formation of these vesicles (Maynell et al., 1992) . Expression of the 2C or 2BC proteins separately in cells using vaccinia virus vectors induced the formation of similar vesicles, but did not cause a n increase in lipid synthesis (Cho et al., 1994; Aldabe and Carrasco, 1995) . 2BC has also been reported to induce vesicle formation in yeast (Barco and Carrasco, 1995) . The replication complex was located on the surface of the vesicles; proteins 2B, 2C, and 2BC were located exclusively with the complex and may be responsible for its organization, whereas 3D and its precursors were also found in the peripheral cytoplasm (Bienz et al., 1990) . Isolated replication complexes were shown to consist of a central replication complex consisting of small, densely packed vesicles, surrounded by larger vesicles in a rosette-like arrangement, which could be disrupted by guanidine, suggesting a role of the 2C protein in the organization of the rosette (Bienz et al., , 1994 Troxler et al., 1992) . The larger vesicles may aid in the release of newly synthesized RNA and in its subsequent encapsidation (Pfister et al., 1995) . Expression of proteins 2B and 3A separately blocked cellular secretion in the absence of virus infection; evidence indicated that in virus-infected cells, 3A may function to block the fusion of the virus-induced vesicles with the Golgi membranes (Doedens and Kirkegaard, 1995) . The 3A and 2B proteins may attach to membranes via hydrophobic domains (Datta and Dasgupta, 1994; van Kuppeveld et al., 1995) ; the 2C protein may attach via the hydrophobic side of an amphipathic helix (Paul et al., 1994b) . It has been suggested that the 3A protein forms a membrane anchor for VPg (in the form of 3AB) in the initiation of RNA synthesis. Mutations in the hydrophobic domain of 3A affected initiation of RNA synthesis, in vitro uridylylation of VPg, and in vivo positive-stranded RNA synthesis (Giachetti and Semler, 1991 ) (see also Section II,E,4).",

The cowpea mosaic virus RNA B-encoded 58K protein is the equivalent of the poliovirus 2C protein (see Section II,E,4) and hence may induce the vesicles in a similar way to the 2C protein. Cowpea mosaic virus has no proteins with significant sequence homology to the poliovirus 2B and 3A proteins, but it is possible that the 58K protein might have domains which serve the same functions.",

RNA synthesis of alphaviruses, such as Sindbis and Semliki Forest virus, takes place on membranous structures called type I cytopathic vacuoles (CPVIs), on the surface of which are located the virus replication proteins nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4 (Froshauer et al., 1988; Peranen and Kaariainen, 1991) . CPVIs are modified endosomes and lysosomes, which have characteristic invaginations (spherules), which may represent the attachment sites for the replication complexes. Spherules are also found at the plasma membrane. When nsPl was expressed alone in cells synchronously, it was located first on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane and then moved to endosomes and later lysosomes (Peranen et al., 1995) . Evidence indicated that nsPl could be acylated, possibly at the plasma membrane, and that it may be attached to membranes by a fatty acid residue; it may act as a n anchor for the other replication proteins. Alarge proportion of the nsP2 protein is normally targeted to the nucleus, but this is irrelevant for replication, because redirection to the cytoplasm by removal of the nuclear localization signal did not affect virus replication (Rikkonen et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "Essential cis-acting sequences will include promoters for negativestrand and positive-strand RNA synthesis. It is also possible that additional sequences might be required for the assembly of replication complexes. Assembly of brome mosaic virus replication complexes in yeast requires the presence of viral RNA (Quadt et al., 1995) . However, once complexes have been assembled in viuo in yeast or plants, after isolation and removal of the RNA template, they remain competent to initiate negative-strand synthesis on added positive-strand templates (Miller and Hall, 1983; Quadt et al., 1995; Sun and Kao, 1996) . It is therefore possible that assembled replication complexes, having copied one template, could be recycled for use on another template. Hence the cis-acting sequences required for replicase assembly and for promoter recognition and initiation of negative-strand synthesis may not be identical, although they are likely to have elements in common. Replication complexes assembled on positive-strand templates could be recycled and modified to recognize negative-strand templates, and evidence suggests that this is the case for the alphaviruses (see Section II,E, 1). However, the ability of flockhouse virus to initiate RNA synthesis on negative-strand templates (Ball, 1994) suggests that, for this virus, a functional RNA polymerase can he assembled on a negativestrand template, although whether this occurs during a normal virus infection remains to be shown. Since accumulation of virus RNA in uivo depends on expression of replication proteins and encapsidation, as well as the RNA replication process p e r se, methods for identifying cis-acting sequences specifically required for RNA replication have relied on DI (and in special cases satellite) RNAs, in vitro transcription systems, and in the case of viruses with segmented genomes, genomic RNA segments not required for replication.",

            "text": "The structural requirements in the tRNA-like sequence of brome mosaic virus (BMV) for RNA replication, aminoacylation and adenylation have been examined in detail (reviewed by David et al., 1992; Duggal et al., 1994) . A 134 nt 3'-terminal fragment containing the tRNA-like structure could act as a template for negative-strand synthesis by a n isolated RdRp in uitro, but large deletions which removed several stem-loops and pseudoknots in the region from nt 135 to 280 upstream of the 3' terminus reduced accumulation of RNA 3 in vivo to undetectable levels, indicating that a larger 3' region was needed for efficient replication in vivo (Lahser et al., 1993) . Furthermore, although the 3'-terminal 200 nt of RNAs 1, 2, and 3 are very similar in sequence, reciprocal exchanges led to aberrant replication, again suggesting a requirement for compatibility with upstream sequences (Duggal et al., 1992) . In the case of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), removal of a single pseudoknot structure upstream of the tRNA-like structure reduced RNA replication (Takamatsu et al., 1990) . The terminal A residue of the BMV template is not copied or required for infectivity; it is added on by a posttranscriptional mechanism, possibly by the RdRp as with Q/ 3 RNA (Blumenthal and Carmichael, 1979) or by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (see below). Initiation of RNA synthesis therefore takes place internally on the template (initiating with a 5'-G) and it is noteworthy that the infectivity of RNA transcripts, produced from cDNA clones, is generally tolerant to 3' extensions of moderate length (Boyer and Haenni, 1994) . Mutations in the terminal C residues of the -CCA terminus of RNA 3 that greatly reduced i n vitro RNA synthesis were rapidly repaired i n viuo, probably by nuclease degradation and resynthesis by tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, an enzyme known to be able to repair tRNA CCA ends , consistent with the suggestion of a telomere-like function for the 3' ends of genomic RNA molecules (Weiner and Maizels, 1987) . Regions of the tRNA-like structure that are important for replication, aminoacylation, and adenylation overlapped, but were distinguishable. Some aminoacylation-defective mutants of RNA 3 were not greatly debilitated in RNA replication, indicating that charging with tyrosine is not essential for replication of this RNA . Further experiments indicated a possible correlation between aminoacylation and replication for RNA 1 (Duggal et al., 1994) and RNA 2 (Rao and Hall, 1991) . In vitro transcription studies with turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) RdRp indicated that 3' tRNA-like structure contained the promoter for negative-strand synthesis (Morch et al., 1987; Gargouri-Bouzid et al., 1991) . Moreover, TYMV RNAs with anticodon loop substitutions that resulted in decreased valylation failed to replicate efficiently (Tsai and Dreher, 1991) . In some cases, second-site suppressor mutations that restored both valylation and replication appeared (Tsai and Dreher, 1992) . Nevertheless, a requirement of aminoacylation for efficient replication cannot be established unequivocally by such correlations, because sequences needed for aminoacylation may also be required for template recognition by the replicase. The 3' termini of tobraviruses and furoviruses can be folded into tRNA-like structures that cannot be aminoacylated.",

            "text": "Reciprocal exchanges of 3' tRNA-like termini have been carried out to determine the template specificity of replicase complexes. It was found that TMV RNA containing a 3' terminal region of BMV RNA 3 was amplified by TMV replicase, although much less efficiently than the wild-type 3' end, indicating that the TMV replicase can recognize some feature of the BMV RNA 3 3'-terminal structure (Ishikawa et al., 1991a) . However, BMV RNA 3 containing a 3' terminal region of TMV RNA was not amplifiable by BMV replicase provided by RNAl and 2, or by TMV RNA, or a mixture of all three. Similarly, replacement of the 3'-terminal tRNA-like structure of TYMV with that of BMV or TMV gave only low viral accumulation in protoplasts and no systemic symptoms on plants (Skuzeski et al., 1996) . In contrast, BMV RNA 3 containing a 3' terminal region of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) RNA 3 could be amplified by BMV RNA 1 and RNA 2 to give both the hybrid RNA 3 and a subgenomic RNA (Rao and Grantham, 1994) , probably reflecting the greater structural similarity of the 3' end of BMV and CMV RNAs than BMV and TMV RNAs. BMV RNA 2 containing a 3'-terminal region of CMV RNA 2 could not be amplified by the BMV RNAs, perhaps reflecting the need for interactions with upstream sequences, since only the terminal 186 nt were exchanged. Reciprocal 3' exchanges between the 3' ends of the RNAs 3 of BMV and a closely related bromovirus, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), indicated that the 3' sequences were not the sole or the major determinants of template specificity (Pacha and Ahlquist, 1991) . The 3' sequences of these two viruses are, however, much more closely related to each other than the other examples discussed above. Overall, it may be concluded that 3' terminal sequences are important determinants of template specificity, with replicase complexes being able to recognize some common structural elements in related viruses.",

In an i n vitro assay with a template-dependent RNA polymerase isolated from plants infected with alfalfa mosaic virus, it was shown that 3' deletions of up to 133 nt in RNA 3 did not affect its ability to act as a template for negative-strand synthesis (van der Kuyl et al., 1990 ). However, a 3' deletion of 163 nt completely abolished its template activity. In a n i n vivo assay in which deletion mutants of RNA 3 were used to infect transgenic plants expressing the P 1 and P2 replication proteins, it was found that deletions of 11 to 133 nt from the 3' end of the RNA-reduced replication to about 1% of that of the full-length RNA 3, whereas a 3' deletion of 200-nt-reduced replication to undetectable levels (van der Kuyl et al., 1991) . It is noteworthy that nucleotides 11 to 127 and nucleotides 133 to 208 of RNA 3 contain independent coat protein (CP) binding sites (Reusken et al., 1994 ; see Section II,F), the replicase complex in virus-infected plants contains the CP and replicase in P1P2 plants can assemble in vivo in the absence of CP. It is possible that the region from nucleotides 11 to 127 is important for the assembly of the replication complex lacking CP and as the promoter for negative-strand synthesis. It is known that CP inhibits the activity of isolated replication complexes in synthesizing negative strands on positive-strand templates, probably by competing for the replicase binding site (Houwing and Jaspars, 1986; .",

Deletion of the poly(A) tail from beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYW) RNA 3 caused a great reduction in ability to replicate (in the presence of RNAs 1 and 2) and the poly(A) tail was restored in the progeny, together with a short upstream U-rich sequence not originally present (Jupin et al., 1990a) . Sequence evidence suggested that the poly(A) sequence was not restored by recombination with RNA 1 or 2. Addition of poly(A) also occurred during infection with 3' poly(A)-deficient transcripts of white clover mosaic virus (Guilford et al., 1991) . Further deletion analysis with BNYW RNA 3 showed that a 67-nt sequence upstream of the poly(A), which can be folded into a double-hairpin secondary structure that is conserved in all four of the virus RNAs, was essential for replication and that a further 50-nt upstream contributed to efficient replication (Jupin et al., 1990b; Richards and Tamada, 1992) .",

Mutagenesis showed the importance of both these features for virus RNA replication. Another upstream putative stem-loop structure within the 3'terminal 151 nt of RNA M was also needed for replication (Rohll et al., 1993) , although the sequences of RNAs M and B have little sequence similarity in this region.

Further analysis indicated that a pseudoknot, formed between the 3' untranslated region and sequences upstream of the translational terminator, was important for replication and one of the stem-loop structures involved base-pairing with five A residues of the poly(A) tail (Jacobson et al., 1993) . Moreover, a n 8-nt insertion which would affect the 5'-proximal of the 3' stem-loop structures conferred a ts replication phenotype (Sarnow et al., 1986) . Further analysis has confirmed the importance for replication of secondary structure in the 3' untranslated regions of poliovirus and other picornaviruses (Rohll et al., 1995) . Mutagenesis of the single 3'-terminal stem-loop formed by a human rhinovirus untranslated region indicated the importance of the loop sequence, the stability of the stem, and its proximity to the poly(A) tract (Rohll et al., 1995) . Binding of picornavirus replication complexes to the 3'-terminal sequences may involve both viral and host proteins. Cui et al. (1993) reported that the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC) 3DPo1 protein bound specifically to the 3' noncoding region of EMC RNA. Further analysis showed that binding was dependent on covalent attachment of the 3' noncoding region and the poly(A), a U-rich sequence upstream of the poly(A) and part of the poly(A) sequence; a stem-loop structure with a pseudoknot linking the poly(A) to a U-rich loop was proposed (Cui and Porter, 1995) . Evidence also suggested that binding of poliovirus 3CDPr\" protein to the poliovirus 3' pseudoknotpoly(A) structure in the presence of the 3AB protein occurred via contact points in 31)p\"' . Host proteins, inducihle hy virus infection, which bound to the 3' regions of rhinovirus and poliovirus RNAs, have also been reported (Todd et al., 1995) .",

Clones of cymbidium ringspot virus (CyRSV) RNA with the terminal CCC deleted, so that the 3' terminus was -G, were infectious for plants with a delay of 2 to 3 days in appearance of symptoms. Analysis of the progeny RNA showed that the 3' end had been repaired by the addition of one or more C residues (Dalmay et al., 199313) . Similarly, -GGGG termini were repaired to -GCCC, although -GGCC termini were stable. Artificially added 3' poly(A) tails were removed i n uiuo. Removal of four nucleotides from the 3' end led to complete loss of infectivity. A repair mechanism also operated with a CyRSV satellite RNA which had heterogeneous 3' termini (-C, -CC, -CCC, -CCCA). Up to eight residues could be removed from the longest 3' terminus without complete loss of infectivity and the molecules were repaired to give termini mostly identical to the wild-type (Dalmay and Rubini, 1995) . The satellite is therefore even more tolerant than the genomic RNA to 3'-terniinal deletions. Short repeat units were characteristic of the 3' termini of both the genomic (GCA GCA AU GCA GC CC) and satellite (ACAACAAC CCA). Turnip crinkle satellite RNA D molecules with 3'-terminal truncations also had their 3' termini restored in uiuo to the motif (C1-2)UG(CI-,J, giving ends similar or identical to the wild-type satellite (CCUGCCC) (Carpenter and Simon, 1996) . This also probably occurred by a repair mechanism, rather than by recombination with the genomic RNA. Whether all these repairs are carried out by the viral polymerase or a cellular enzyme is not known. However, as with the tRNA-like termini (see Section I?A,1), analogies to telomerase, an enzyme that contains an RNA template, and to the short repeated sequences in the telomeres of cellular chromosomes (Blackburn, 1993) have been made (Dalmay and Rubino, 1995; Carpenter and Simon, 1996) .",

Similar 3' regions are retained in DI RNAs of other tombusviruses, such as cucumber necrosis virus and tomato bushy stunt virus (Knorr et al., 1991; Finnen and Rochon, 1993; Chang et al., 1995) . The 77-nt CyRSV DI RNA 3' domain could be folded into a structure composed of three hairpins and two non-basepaired regions. Mutational analysis showed that replication competence depended on maintaining the structure of the stems . The ability to form 3' stem-loop structures is conserved in all the carmo-like viruses. Using a n i n uitro transcription system, it has been shown that the promoter for negative-strand synthesis of a turnip crinkle virus (TCV) satellite RNA (sat-RNA c) is contained within the 3'-terminal29 nt of the positive strand (Song and Simon, 1995) . Structural probing revealed the presence of hairpin structure within this region. Mutagenesis showed that the primary sequence or size of the loop was not important for replication. However mutations that altered the structural integrity of the lower part of the stem strongly reduced template activity i n uitro. The 3' 37 nt of sat-RNA C could be joined to a n inactive template and the resultant hybrid was competent for transcription i n uitro by the TCV RdRp. The 3'terminal sequences of TCV genomic RNA and sat-RNA C are 90% identical and the 3' genomic RNA could be folded into a similar hairpin structure. However, upstream motifs in the 3' untranslated region of TCV RNA, close to the end of the coat protein ORF, are also important for RNA replication in uiuo (Carpenter et al., 1995) . It is noteworthy that the TCV RdRp could utilize negative strands of sat-RNA C as templates (Song and Simon 1994) . Template activity depended on 5'proximal sequences, but was insensitive to 3' deletions, suggesting that the RdRp recognized a 5' sequence and then scanned the RNA for a 3' terminus to initiate positive-strand synthesis. It is possible that the RdRp might recognize a stem-loop structure at the 5' end of the negative strand.",

No further upstream sequences were required, but DI RNAs which transcribed subgenomic RNAs synthesized less negative-stranded RNA.

            "text": "The ability of the 5'-terminal 90 nt of poliovirus RNA to fold into a cloverleaf structure, its ability to bind 3CDP'O in the presence of 3AB or an N-terminal fragment of EF-In, its requirement for RNA replication, and a model for its role in initiating positive-strand synthesis were discussed in Sections II,E,4 and 111. Both the 5'-positive and 3'negative termini can form cloverleaf structures, but mutagenesis showed that only the positive-strand cloverleaf is functional (Andino et al., 1990) . The 5' 44 nt of RNAs B and M of cowpea mosaic virus, a plant picorna-like virus, have a high degree of sequence similarity and are interchangeable (van Bokhoven et al., 1993) , but whether they are structurally and functionally analogous to the poliovirus 5' cloverleaf structure is not known. Marsh and Hall (1987) discovered sequences in the 5' untranslated regions of brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNAs that resemble consensus sequences for the internal control regions (ICR1 and ICR2) of tRNA promoters. In the mature tRNA, ICRl (box A), and ICR2 (box B) correspond to the D-loop and T-loop respectively (Geiduschek and Kassavetis, 1992) . ICR-like sequences have also been found in other bromoviruses, cucumoviruses, tobamoviruses, tobraviruses, tymoviruses, and tobacco necrosis satellite virus . Pogue and Hall (1992) proposed that the 5'-terminal region of BMV RNA 2 could be folded into a stem-loop structure with the ICR2-like motif in the loop and the ICR1-like motif comprising part of the stem. Similar structures were predicted for the 5' termini of BMV RNAs 1 and 3, RNAs of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) (Pogue and Hall, 1992) and alfalfa mosaic virus . Mutational analysis established the importance of the proposed structure and the ICR-like motifs in the replication of BMV RNA 2 (Pogue and Hall, 1992; Pogue et al., 1990 Pogue et al., , 1992 . In particular, it was shown that the structure was important in the 5'-terminal region of the positive strand, but not in the 3'-terminal region of the negative strand. ICR2-like motifs were located within 27-nt repeats in the 5' untranslated sequence of alfalfa mosaic virus RNA 3, which were shown to be important for the replication of this RNA . These results led to a model in which a host factor, possibly a transcription factor associated with RNA polymerase 111, binds to the ICR-like region at the 5' terminus of the positive strand of the doublestranded replicative form dsRNA and plays a role in the formation of an initiation complex for positive-stranded RNA synthesis (Pogue and Hall, 1992; Pogue et al., 1994) . Support for the model and involvement of ICR-like motifs comes from the finding that binding of some host proteins to the 5'-terminal sequence of the positive strand and the 3'-terminal sequence of the negative strand did not occur i n RNA 2 mutants with substitutions in the ICR2-like motif and known to be debilitated in replication (Duggal and Hall, 1995) .",

The 5' untranslated sequence of tobacco mosaic virus lacks G residues and contains multiple CAA repeats. The sequence is highly conserved and the 5'-terminal 31 nt are almost identical in different strains. Deletion analysis of the 5'-terminal region of the L strain showed that large deletions (nucleotides 9-47 or 25-71) abolished replication, but of approximately 10-nt deletions across the whole region, only a deletion of nucleotides 2-8 abolished replication (Takamatsu et al., 1991) . The progeny of in planta replication of some TMV subgenomic replicons included a molecule with only 23 nt at the 5' terminus (Raffo and Dawson, 1991) . There is no evidence for the involvement of ICR-like motifs in this region. The 312-nt 5' untranslated region of beet necrotic yellow vein virus RNA 3 can be folded into a structure containing several stem-loop structures, which involves long-range base-pairing between different cis-active elements. Chemical and enzymatic probing, and mutational analysis, has provided evidence for the structure and its involvement in the promotion of positive-strand synthesis (Gilmer et al., 199213, 1993) .",

Whether this also applies to replication of the genomic RNAs is not known. It is noteworthy, however, that long 5'-terminal extensions generally render RNA transcripts produced from cDNA clones noninfectious (Boyer and Haenni, 1994) . Since a 5'-terminal positive-strand extension would be copied to produce a 3'-terminal negative-strand extension, it may be the unpaired base (rather than the length or sequence of the extension) that is important.

In some cases, such sequences may be required to maintain an optimal RNA structure for binding of the replicase complex to promoters at the termini of the positive-or negative-stranded RNAs, or to promote processivity of the replicase during RNA synthesis. In other cases, it is possible that the replicase could bind to internal sequences for a particular purpose, e.g., translational repression, or for an obligatory step in the assembly or modification of RNA complexes. Phage &B replicase, lacking the additional host factor, HF1 (see Section III), binds strongly to internal sites on the &B RNA positive strand, but weakly if at all to the 3' terminus. The purpose of this internal binding, which requires the ribosomal S1 protein component of the replicase, is probably to prevent binding of ribosomes upstream of the coat protein cistron, because the replicase is unable to dislodge ribosomes travelling along the RNA in the opposite direction (van Duin, 1988) . Addition of HF1, which binds to both an internal and the 3'-terminal region of the RNA, serves to bring the 3'-terminal region in contact with the replicase to allow initiation of negative-strand synthesis (Barrera et al., 1993) . Q, 8 replicase does not bind internally on the RNA negative strand and does not require HF1 for initiation of positive-strand synthesis (van Duin, 1988; Barrera et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "A sequence of about 150 nt in the 5' region of the 244-nt intercistronic region of brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA 3, which separates the movement protein (3a) and coat protein ORFs, is required in cis for efficient replication of this RNA (French and Ahlquist, 1987) . Removal of this region decreased RNA 3 replication to less than 1% of wild-type levels. This decrease was not due to effects on movement protein or coat protein gene expression, because frameshift mutations which abolished synthesis of these proteins had little effect on replication. This intercistronic region contains ICR-like motifs; removal of the motif which best fit the tRNA gene ICR2 consensus sequence reduced RNA replication to 15% of wild-type levels (Pogue et al., 1992) , indicating that this sequence contributes to the function of the intercistronic region in RNA 3 replication. In yeast, synthesis of BMV negative strand RNA 3 required intercistronic sequences, as well as the 3'terminal sequence (Quadt et al., 1995) . In uitro synthesis of BMV negative-strand RNA 3 by an isolated RdRp extract did not require the intercistronic sequences; this could indicate that these sequences are required specifically for the assembly of the replication complex or that current RdRp extracts lack essential components and contain only a basal activity. Sequences of the intercistronic regions of RNA 3 of cucumber mosaic virus, which contain an ICR2-like motif , and alfalfa mosaic virus (van der Vossen et al., 1995) , have also been shown to be important for RNA replication. In contrast, replication of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus RNA 3 did not require its intercistronic region and was less susceptible than BMV RNA 3 to large deletions in the RNA (Pacha et al., 1990) . I t has also been suggested that some of the BMV 2a protein coding region may be required in cis for replication of RNA 2, since RNA 2 mutants lacking the C-terminal region of the 2a protein could be replicated in trans in the presence of wild-type RNA 2, but mutants with larger deletions, encompassing the central and N-terminal region of 2a, could not (Pogue et al., 1990; Marsh et al., 1991b) . In contrast, there do not appear to be any essential cis-acting replication elements in the coding regions of tobacco mosaic virus RNA. Mutants with deletions across the 126-kDa or 183-kDa replication protein ORFs could be replicated in protoplasts in trans by the wild-type proteins; deletion of the C-terminal part of the 183-kDa ORF increased replication . TMV-derived replicons with most of the 126-kDah83-kDa ORFs removed also replicated well and spread in plants in the presence of a helper virus (Raffo and Dawson, 1991) . Furthermore, TMV mutants lacking the movement protein and coat protein ORFs replicated in protoplasts as well a s wild-type; a decline in the accumulation of the mutant positive strand relative to that of the wild-type was only observed late in the infection and was ascribed to degradation of the RNAin the absence of the coat protein (Ishikawa et al., 1991b) . The animal alphaviruses have a conserved 51-nt sequence near the beginning of the P123/4 ORF, which can be folded into a structure with two stem-loops. Of 21 silent mutations in this region, 19 resulted in a decrease of virus growth of two to four orders of magnitude (Niesters and Strauss, 1990) . Some of the deleterious mutations could potentially disrupt the secondary structure, whereas others would not be expected to. The 51-nt sequence was also found to be necessary for efficient accumulation of DI RNAs, although deletion of the element did not reduce DI RNA replication as much as expected when compared to the effect of mutations in this region in the genomic RNA (Levis et al., 1986; Schlesinger et al., 1987) . Internal regions of the DI RNAs derive from other parts of the alphavirus genome and are presumably selected for efficiency of replication and packaging of the RNA (reviewed by Strauss and Strauss, 1994) .",

(1985) for brome mosaic virus (BMV) using a n isolated RdRp and in vivo by Gargouri et al. (1989) for turnip yellow mosaic virus. Following convention, sequences of subgenomic promoters will be discussed on the positive strand, although it is the negative strand that acts as the template. The BMV subgenomic promoter, for synthesis of the coat protein subgenomic mRNA, has been defined in uitro (Marsh et al., 1988) and in uivo (French and Ahlquist, 1988) . It is contained within the 250-nt intergenic region between the movement protein and coat protein genes, and extends between 74 and 95 nt upstream and 16 nt downstream of the transcriptional initiation site. It consists of three functional domains. The first of these is the core promoter, which includes the initiation site, 20 n t upstream and about 15 n t downstream; this is sufficient for a low basal level of transcription and determines correct initiation. Immediately upstream of the core promoter is a poly(A) tract, which acts as a n activator and possible spacer; similar poly(A) tracts are present in equivalent locations in other bromoviruses. Upstream of the poly(A) is a further enhancer region which contains imperfect direct repeats of sequences in the core promoter. The subgenomic promoter is distinct from, but may overlap at its 5' extremity, the cis-acting intergenic sequence required for efficient replication of RNA 3 (see Section V,C); mutations in the ICR2-like (box B) motif of the latter reduced RNA 3 synthesis without affecting subgenomic RNA synthesis (Smirnyagina ci al., 1994) .",

The basal promoter lies in a \"junction\" sequence from -19 to +5, which is highly conserved in different alphaviruses (Levis et al., 1990) . Full promoter activity (about fivefold greater than the basal promoter) is contained within the -98 to +14 sequence (Raju and Huang, 1991) . Sequence comparisons between the animal alphavirus and plant alpha-like virus subgenomic promoters identified a number of conserved motifs (Marsh et al., 1988; French and Ahlquist, 1988; van der Vossen et al., 1995) . Mutation of some of these in the AlMV subgenomic promoter led to a decrease in activity (van der Vossen et al., 1995) . The poly(A) tract found in bromovirus subgenomic promoters was not found in the animal alphavirus subgenomic promoters or those of the other plant alpha-like viruses. Mutants of BMV RNA 3 lacking the poly(A) tract synthesize little coat protein, but second-site mutations in the intergenic region can suppress the transcriptional defect (Smirnyagina et al., 1994) . One of these mutations was a duplication of the sequence UAUUAUUA immediately 5' to the deleted poly(A); this sequence had previously been shown to be an important enhancer element in the wild-type subgenomic promoter (Marsh et al., 1988) . Hence the BMV subgenomic promoter, like those of other alpha-like viruses, can function in the absence of a poly(A) tract.",

With tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the level of expression of genes closest to the 3' end of the positive strand was the highest, but this has been shown to be due to translational control, there being little difference in the levels of subgenomic RNAs produced with promoters at different positions (Culver et al., 1993) . Wild-type TMV RNA has two subgenomic promoters, one for the movement protein which is expressed early and another for the coat protein which is expressed late.

Every subgenomic RNA has a n identical 5'-terminal leader sequence which varies in length (60-90 nt), depending on the coronavirus. The leader sequence is only found at the 5' end of the genomic RNA, which implies that subgenomic mRNAs are formed by fusion of two noncontiguous elements. Ultraviolet irradiation inactivation experiments established that the leader and body of the mRNAs were not joined together by a splicing mechanism (Stern and Sefton, 1982) . Upstream of each gene are conserved sequence elements, referred to as IS elements. There is sequence homology between sequence elements (present in varying numbers of copies) in the 3' region of the leader sequence and the IS elements. For mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), every IS contains the sequence (AAUCUAAAC) or a closely related sequence. These IS elements are believed to function as promoters for subgenomic mRNA synthesis (van der Most et al., 1994) . For MHV, the smallest mRNAs are generally synthesized in larger amounts that the larger ones, although this is not the case for all coronaviruses (Hiscox et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "Several models have been proposed to account for the preceding observations in the synthesis of coronavirus mRNAs (Lai, 1990) . One group of models proposes that the virus genomic RNA acts as a template for the synthesis of a full-length negative strand, which in turn acts as a template for the synthesis of both progeny-genomic RNA and the subgenomic RNAs. In the leader-primed hypothesis, the 5' leader is first synthesized and this then acts a s a primer for initiation of subgenomic RNA synthesis at one of the IS elements, either on the same RNA (by looping out of the intervening RNA), or by detachment of the polymerase with its leader and reattachment to another RNA template. The discovery of full-length negative strands and the isolation of replicative intermediates containing nascent subgenomic RNAs with the leader attached was consistent with this model (Baric et al., 1983b) . Evidence that the polymerase and leader can detach from one template and attach to another comes from observations that the leader sequences undergo rapid exchanges between two RNA molecules, for example between mRNAs of two MHV strains or between an MHV RNA and a DI RNA (Makino et al., 1986; Makino and Lai, 1989) . Also a n exogenously added leader can be incorporated into mRNAs in an in uitro transcription system (Baker and Lai, 1990) or in uiuo from a helper virus when supplied as a negative strand containing a n IS sequence (Hiscox et al., 1995) . Reattachment to new templates could be aided by sequence homology between the 3' leader region and IS elements. It may also involve host proteins which bind to the IS regions (Zhang and Lai, 1995) . Mutations in IS regions which reduced subgenomic RNA synthesis also reduced host protein binding. Further studies showed that the leader sequence can act both in trans and in cis (Zhang et al., 1994) and that leader switching is facilitated by a 9-nt sequence (UUUAUAAAC) located immediately downstream of the leader sequence, possibly at the end of a stem-loop structure (Zhiang and Lai, 1996) . The leader-primed model has some features in common with the model proposed by Carpenter et al. (1995) for recombination in turnip-crinkle-virus-associated RNAs, although the former is clearly a more directed process.",

The suggestion that subgenomic RNAs might be formed by the leader-primed mechanism and then replicate independently seems unlikely in view of the inability of transfected positive-stranded subgenomic RNAs to be replicated in the presence of helper virus (Brian et ul., 1994) . Sawicki (1990, 1995) have suggested a model in which discontinuous synthesis of subgenomic RNAs occurs during negative-strand synthesis. The polymerase is proposed to pause a t a n IS element in the positive-strand template and then either continue synthesis or detach with the nascent strand and reattach on the same or different RNA molecules to copy the leader sequence. It was suggested that having copied an IS element, the polymerase might retract in a way analogous to some DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Kassavetis and Geiduschek, 1993) and suggested for some types of recombination between brome mosaic virus RNAs , and remain associated with the template. The IS sequences a t the 3' end of the nascent strand could then align with complementary sequences on the positive-strand template in the 3' region of the leader sequence. The newly synthesized subgenomic negative strand could then act a s a preferred template for synthesis of positive-strand subgenomic RNA by the same polymerase complex. It has been shown that MHV downstream IS elements have a negative impact on transcription from upstream IS elements, whereas upstream IS elements have little effect on transcription from downstream IS elements (van Marle et al., 1995) , consistent with the greater synthesis of the shorter mRNAs. This is nicely explained by the model of Sawicki and Sawicki (1995) because the polymerase would have a choice of detachment or continued synthesis a t each IS element encountered and therefore fewer polymerase molecules would reach the 1s elements upstream in the positive-strand template. The various models have not yet been unequivocally resolved because other work has suggested that the subgenomic negative strands, apparently present in the cell in double-stranded RNA form, may be a dead-end product (Lin ct al., 1994) . Double-stranded RNA subgenomic RNAs of the alpha-like viruses are generally considered to be dead-end products, because they lack the upstream promoter sequences. However, further studies are needed to resolve this issue for coronavirus subgenomic RNAs.",

Estimates range from 1O:l (flaviviruses; Chambers et al., 1990) , 50-100: 1 (coronaviruses; Lai, 1990) , 1OO:l (brome mosaic virus, French and Ahlquist, 1987) , 1000:l (alfalfa mosaic virus; Nassuth and Bol, 1983 ). This could be due to down-regulation of negative-strand synthesis and/or up-regulation of positive-strand synthesis. In the alpha-like virus superfamily, it has been shown for Sindbis virus and other alphaviruses , alfalfa mosaic virus (van der Vossen et al., 1994) , and tobacco mosaic virus (Ishikawa et al., 1991b ) that negative-strand synthesis is switched off or greatly reduced a few hours after infection, whereas positive-strand synthesis continues throughout the replication cycle. There are many examples of mutations in virus replication proteins which affect positive-and negative-strand synthesis differently, e.g., in alphaviruses (reviewed by Strauss and Strauss, 1994) , bromoviruses (reviewed by , Duggal et al., 1994 , and tobamoviruses (reviewed by Dawson and Lehto, 1990) . Hence replication complexes which synthesize negative and positive strands (and subgenomic RNAs) may be different or one may be modified to form the other. It is noteworthy that the phage Q/ 3 replicase complexes for synthesis of positive and negative strands differ. The enzyme for negativestrand synthesis contains the host factor (HF1 protein), whereas that for positive-strand synthesis does not. When HF1 protein is in excess, equal amounts of positive and negative strands are produced. When HF1 is in limiting amount, as in the cell, negative-strand synthesis is limited and positive-strand synthesis predominates (Blumenthal and Carmichael, 1979) .",

It appears that replication complexes are only formed on the positive-strand templates and the number of replication complexes formed depends on the number of negative strands synthesized. Once negative-strand synthesis has ceased, positive-strand synthesis carries on using the stable replication complex already formed, leading to the observed asymmetry in positive-and negative-strand accumulation.",

            "text": "The model of Pogue and Hall (1992) for the replication of brome mosaic virus also suggests that the replicase complex, having assembled on a positive-strand template and synthesized a negative strand, is then modified to use the negative strand as a template. This does not account for the strand asymmetry, because infection of protoplasts with RNA 1 and 2, which encode the l a and 2a replication proteins, produced a 1:l ratio of positive to negative strands. However infection with RNAs 1, 2 and 3 produced a 1OO:l ratio of positive to negative strands (Marsh et aZ., 1991a) . RNA 3 therefore controls the strand asymmetry. Mutational analysis showed that the coat protein, which is synthesized from a subgenomic RNA derived from RNA 3, while contributing to the strand asymmetry, was not a major determinant of it. A deletion of the subgenomic core promoter and the first 5' 43 nt of the subgenomic RNA synthesis reduced the strand asymmetry to 1.8:l. It has been suggested that sequences in the intergenic region of RNA 3 may form a platform on which a positive-strand-synthesizing replicase could be assembled (Duggal et al., 1994) . It is noteworthy that deletion of the core subgenomic promoter in RNA 3 resulted in production of a n RdRp in yeast with increased ability to synthesize negative strands in vitro (Quadt et al., 1995) , perhaps again indicating differences between replicase complexes able to synthesize positive and negative strands. Differences in replicase complexes for positive-and negative-strand synthesis have also been invoked for alfalfa mosaic virus, but for this virus the coat protein was shown to be the main activator of positivestrand synthesis (see Sections II,E,l and 11,F). Nevertheless, the shutoff of negative-strand RNA 3 synthesis in P12 transgenic plants appeared to be independent of the coat protein (van der Vossen et al., 1994) , a further indication that negative-strand and positive-strand synthesis for this virus may be regulated separately.",

Negative-stranded RNA synthesis of the flavivirus dengue virus continued throughout the entire replication cycle (Cleaves et al., 1981) . Although negative strand-synthesis of coronaviruses peaked a t 5-6 hours after infection, some synthesis continued until late in infection (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986) . Viruses in the picorna-like virus supergroup pose a different problem because both positive and negative strands have VPg 5' termini (see Section 11,D). Hence one polyprotein molecule has to be synthesized for every RNA molecule synthesized (unless VPg released from RNAs destined to be translated can be recycled, which seems unlikely for poliovirus if the primer is 3ABpU; see Sections II,D and II,E,4). However poliovirus RNA synthesis is not completely linked to translation throughout the whole replication cycle, because synthesis of both positive and negative strands can continue for some time after addition of inhibitors of protein synthesis (Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994) .",

            "text": "It is clear that there are some similarities in RNA replication for all eukaryotic positive-stranded RNA viruses, i.e., the mechanism of polymerization of the nucleotides is probably similar for all. It is noteworthy that all appear to utilize host membranes as a site of replication. Membranes appear to function not just as a way of compartmentalizing virus RNA replication, but also appear to have a central role in the organization and functioning of the replication complex and further studies in this area are needed. Within virus supergroups, similarities are evident between animal and plant viruses, e.g., in the nature and arrangements of replication genes and in sequence similarities of functional domains. However, it is also clear that there has been considerable divergence, even within supergroups. For example, the animal alphaviruses have evolved to encode proteinases which play a central controlling function in the replication cycle, whereas this is not common in the plant alpha-like viruses and even when it occurs, as in the tymoviruses, the strategies that have evolved appear to be significantly different. Some of the divergence could be host-dependent and the increasing interest in the role of host proteins in replication should be fruitful in revealing how different systems have evolved. Even within the plant alpha-like viruses, there are significant differences in regulation mechanisms. An outstanding question which needs to be solved is, for those viruses which appear to show some form of cis-preferential replication, such as poliovirus Novak and Kirkegaard, 1994) and turnip yellow mosaic virus (Weiland and Dreher, 1993) , whether or not the replication complex assembles on the RNA from which it has been translated. Other possibilities have been discussed by Wimmer et al. (1993) and Novak and Kwkegaard (1994) . Finally, there arc virus supergroups which appear to have no close relatives between animals and plants, such as the animal coronavirus-like supergroup and the plant carmo-like supergroup. Nevertheless, our knowledge of positive-stranded RNA virus replication is still in its infancy and future research may reveal unsuspected similarities. More comprehensive comparisons must await further knowledge of the assembly and structures of replication complexes and how they are modified to utilize and initiate RNA synthesis a t different promoters on positive-and negative-strand RNA templates.
