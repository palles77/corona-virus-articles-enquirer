Here, we identified tylophorine compounds, including naturally occurring and synthetic phenanthroindolizidines and phenanthroquinolizidines, as potent in vitro inhibitors of enteropathogenic coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The potent compounds showed 50% maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values ranging from 8 to 1468 nM as determined by immunofluorescent assay of the expression of TGEV N and S proteins and by real time-quantitative PCR analysis of viral yields. Furthermore, the potent tylophorine compounds exerted profound anti-TGEV replication activity and thereby blocked the TGEV-induced apoptosis and subsequent cytopathic effect in ST cells. Analysis of the structure-activity relations indicated that the most active tylophorine analogues were compounds with a hydroxyl group at the C14 position of the indolizidine moiety or at the C3 position of the phenanthrene moiety and that the quinolizidine counterparts were more potent than indolizidines. In addition, tylophorine compounds strongly reduced cytopathic effect in Vero 76 cells induced by human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), with EC 50 values ranging from less than 5 to 340 nM. Moreover, a pharmacokinetic study demonstrated high and comparable oral bioavailabilities of 7-methoxycryptopleurine (52.7%) and the naturally occurring tylophorine (65.7%) in rats. Thus, our results suggest that tylophorine compounds are novel and potent anti-coronavirus agents that may be developed into therapeutic agents for treating TGEV or SARS CoV infection.",

No effective therapy exists for SARS CoV infection, despite tremendous effort invested in finding anti-SARS CoV drugs, including targeting SARS CoV-specific main protease or viral attachment, entry, and fusion for intervention.

IFA and CPE and cytotoxicity assays were also as described (Yang et al., 2007b) . Briefly, ST cells in 96-well plates, with or without a 2 h pretreatment with test compounds, were infected with TGEV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for IFA. The IFA was performed at 6 h post-infection (hpi) with antibodies against the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of TGEV. The cells were treated with 10 different concentrations of test compounds. The results of these assays were used to obtain the dose-response curves from which 50% maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values were determined. For the CPE assay, TGEV was inoculated into a monolayer of ST cells in 12-well plates at 5 MOI, and the CPE was determined at 24 hpi for detection of anti-TGEV activity. TGEV-induced CPE is characterized by a rounding and enlargement of cells, formation of syncytia, and detachment of cells into the medium. Results presented are representative of at least 3 independent experiments. For cytotoxicity assay, ST cells cultured in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Inc.) and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Co.) in 96-well plates were treated with 10 different concentrations of test compounds for 24 h. The resulting dose-response curves were used to determine 50% maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) values.",

These active benzothiazolium compounds inhibit TGEV with EC 50 values or 50% maximal inhibition concentration (IC 50 ) values ranging from \u223c2 to \u223c36 M (Yang et al., 2007b) .",

Accidentally, our laboratory found that tylophorine (1a) and 7-methoxycryptopleurine (1c) potently inhibited TGEV replication, as assessed by IFA with antibodies against the N and S proteins of TGEV. EC 50 values for the compounds were 58 \u00b1 4 and 20 \u00b1 1 nM, respectively ( Fig. 2A and Table 1 ). However, the compounds at up to 20 M did not significantly inhibit TGEV or SARS CoV 3CL pro enzymatic activity (data not shown). Moreover, the two compounds exerted long-lasting, for at least 64 hpi, inhibition of virus CPE in TGEV-infected ST cells, in contrast to TGEV-infected ST cells without compound treatment which exhibited significant CPE for about 20-24 hpi (Fig. 2B) . We examined the other apoptosis indicator for TGEV-infected ST cells, activation of caspase 3, and found good agreement with the anti-CPE effects of tylophorine (1a) and 7-methoxycryptopleurine (1c) (Fig. 2C) .",

Thus far, inhibitors targeting the SARS CoV protease have been reported to have IC 50 values ranging from 0.5 to 7 M and the SARS CoV papain-like protease in the 100 nM range. However, the anti-enzymatic activity of these inhibitors may not exhibit corresponding anti-SARS CoV activity in cells (Ghosh et al., 2008) . Because we have used porcine TGEV as a surrogate system to search for potential anti-SARS CoV agents (Yang et al., 2007a) , we tested the tylophorine compounds 1a, 1c, 1e, 4a, and 4b for anti-CPE activity induced by SARS CoV (Urbani strain) in Vero 76 cells. These compounds were found to have profound activity with EC 50 values ranging from 0.34 M to <0.005 M and selective index (SI) values from 10 to >100 determined by CPE assay under microscopic observation whereas their EC 50 values ranging from 0.62 M to <0.005 M and SI values from 6.8 to >15 determined by Neutral red uptake assay, respectively ( Table 2 ). The CPE assay in Vero 76 cells induced by SARS CoV takes 3-4 days (Barnard et al., 2006) and tylophorine compounds have been reported to inhibit cell growth Lee et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2009) , so that on the day for assay the final cell numbers would have 2-to 16-fold difference and the cell volume usually larger for those treated with tylophorine compounds (our unpublished data). This also was manifested by comparing the cell numbers and cell sizes of SARS CoV infected Vero 76 cells treated by compound 1a to those without SARS infected control in the equal area under microscope (Fig. 4) . Therefore, it is conceivable that lower SI values were obtained from Neutral red uptake assay determining relative cell numbers than those from CPE assay by observation under microscope. These compounds also decreased the formation of large syncytia and/or multinucleated giant cells resulting from virus-induced fusion of cell membranes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4) . Thus, these tylophorine compounds are potent small molecules for anti-SARS CoV protection in cell systems.",

Among the most potent tylophorine analogues inhibiting TGEV were compounds 1e, 1g, and 1h with a hydroxyl group at C14 or at the phenanthrene moiety C3. EC 50 values for these compounds were 82 \u00b1 8, 8 \u00b1 2 and 18 \u00b1 1 nM, respectively. Thus, these hydroxyl groups contributed significantly to the inhibitory activity exhibited by the tylophorine analogues. However, introduction of an OAc-group into the C14 position decreased the activity by \u223c5-fold as compared with compounds with a hydrogen or a hydroxyl group-replacement (1f to 1d and 1e, respectively). Although 1d and 1e had similar potency, they differed in cytotoxicity and thus in selectivity (Table 1) , which is an important concern for future drug development. Moreover, introduction of a methoxyl group to position C4 of tylophorine decreased the inhibitory activity of the parent compound \u223c4to 8-fold for both the indolizidine and the quinolizidine counterparts (1a to 1b  and 1c to 1i) . Similarly, replacing the methoxyl with a hydrogen group at position C2 of tylophorine decreased the inhibitory activity of both the indolizidine and the quinolizidine counterparts but to a lesser extent (1a to 1d and 1c to 1j) . In addition, compounds 4a and 4b with an oxygen atom introduced to the reactive nitrogen to form an N-oxide as compared with 1a and 1c, respectively, exerted less potency, by \u223c8to 25-fold. Introduction of the N-oxide to the indolizidine/quinolizidine moiety changed the nitrogen reac- tivity and might affect the position projection of hydrogen atoms for potency because dehydrogenation in this moiety profoundly decreased activity, e.g. 1a to 2a/3a and 1c to 2c/3c. Similarly, the phenanthroquinolizidines 1c and 4b were more potent than their phenanthroindolizidine counterparts 1a and 4a for anti-SARS CoV activity, and the hydroxyl group at C14 contributed significantly to the inhibitory activity exhibited by compound 1e.",

The SI values and CC50/EC50 were also calculated. a EC50: the 50% maximal effective concentration. b CC50: the 50% maximal cytotoxic concentration. c SI: selectivity index, CC50/EC50. (1a) were added in equal volumes to near-confluent cell monolayers of Vero 76 cells in culture plates. The MOI used was ranged from 0.01 to 0.025 to produce virus cytopathic effects in 100% of the cells in the virus control wells within 3-4 days along with a mock infection control. The plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C until the cells in the virus control wells showed complete viral CPE as observed by light microscopy and stained with neutral red as described (Barnard et al., 2006) . Equal field areas of each treatment were shown from microscopic observation at 100\u00d7 magnification. methoxycryptopleurine (1c) ( Table 3) . 7-Methoxycryptopleurine is a synthetic compound that is not naturally occurring (Yang et al., 2007a) . After the intravenous administration of 1a and 1c at 3 mg/kg, the total body clearances were 66.8 \u00b1 15.3 and 101.0 \u00b1 8.8 ml/min/kg for 1a and 1c, respectively. The volumes of distribution at steady state (V ss ) were 16.6 \u00b1 2.3 and 31.6 \u00b1 4.1 L/kg for 1a and 1c, respectively, which suggests a wide distribution of these compounds to the extravascular tissues. The apparent elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) with an intravenous dose was long, at \u223c4 h for both compounds. After oral administration, the compounds were rapidly absorbed; the C max values of 31.9 \u00b1 17.5 and 16.5 \u00b1 10.4 ng/ml were reached at 1.8 and 1.0 h for 1a and 1c, respectively, after administration. The oral bioavailability of 1c was estimated to be 52.7%, which was comparable to that of 1a, 65.7%, and suggests conserved oral bioavailability for these compounds.",

The content of phenanthroindolizidines differs in each Tylophora plant and could slightly vary by harvest season and location. For instance, tylophorine is the main active constituent of T. indica (Gopalakrishnan et al., 1980) , tylophorinine in T. atrofolliculata (Huang et al., 2004) , and 14-hydroxytylophorine in T. ovata (our unpublished data). In addition, the potency and toxicity of each phenanthroindolizidine may vary depending on the plant source (Table 1 and our unpublished data). Thus, the doses to achieve efficacy and selectivity must be investigated as part of the drug development process, regardless of the formulation, of pure compounds or herbal medicine. Our study is the first to report and compare the pharmacokinetics of naturally occurring tylophorine and synthesized 7-methoxycryptopleurine. We demonstrated their good oral bioavailability. Because of the efficacy, selectivity and oral bioavailability of the tylophorine compounds we report, efforts to develop and optimize more drug-like derivatives of these compounds are warranted.",

The compounds were exposed to the Vero 76 cells in the SARS CoV tests for 72 h, which gives the compounds longer to become toxic to cells, the neutral red uptake assays used are more sensitive evaluation of cytotoxicity or growth inhibition (Smee et al., 2002) , and there always tissue to tissue differences when assessing cytotoxicity (Smee et al., 2002) . Cells derived from swine testicular tissue apparently are less sensitive to toxicity than cells derived from monkey kidneys. The main effect of the tylophorine compounds is to inhibit TGEV replication in ST cells thereby blocking TGEV-induced apoptosis signaling in ST cells (Figs. 2 and 3) . The tylophorine compounds may be administered prophylactically and therapeutically because both administration regimens greatly inhibited TGEV replication, as measured by IFA ( Fig. 2A) . Therefore, tylophorine compounds are likely to inhibit TGEV replication event(s) after the viruses enter the cells. Moreover, the ability of these compounds to inhibit other coronaviruses such as SARS CoV in Vero 76 cells (Table 2 and Fig. 4 ) and increase the survival rate of mice infected with MHV-JHM (data not shown) suggests that these compounds inhibit a common or highly conserved target among coronaviruses involved in coronaviral transcriptional complex, e.g. RdRp, helicase, N protein etc., or common cellular factors those are crucial for coronaviral replication. Further detailed mechanism studies of the effect of tylophorine compounds at molecular levels on TGEV replication in infected ST cells are under investigation.",
