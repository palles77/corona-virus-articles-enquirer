Regarding self-reported practice, only few participants would ask dentists about sterilization of dental instruments (9.3%), wearing face mask (13.3%) and gloves (16.4%) if they don't do so. In conclusion, our participants had good attitudes towards infection control in dentistry. However, their knowledge and practice need improvements. Conduction of educational programs is needed through social media, mass media, schools and public places. These programs involve both patients and providers. \u00a9 2016 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences. Published by Elsevier Limited. All rights reserved.",

Exposure to blood and body fluids need great concerns from both dental care providers and the patients [5] . A study done in Riyadh, KSA, showed that 3.2% of female patients attended the dental clinics of King Saud University had seropositive HBV and HCV. Meanwhile, they didn't know about their infection and had no clinical manifestations. The study concluded that taking medical history without screening for HBV and HCV might lead to treating infected patients as non infected and this can increase the risk of cross infection unless strict adherence to standard precautions is applied [9] . Another study conducted by reviewing literature done on occupational risks of viral infections in the operating room over the last 5 decades. Results revealed that the risks of viral infections remained the same as a decade ago [10] . Furthermore, a house-hold survey done in Damietta, Egypt, 2014, found that 1.1% of the participants were infected with HBV, 9.3% with HCV, and both infections co-existed in 0.4%. One of the main risk factors for both infections was exposure to dental procedures [11] . In addition, the continuous increase in the number of patients seeking dental clinics should give alarming signs to dentists and Dental Health Care Programs (DHCPs) for better awareness of extra-precautions required while treating the dental patients. These measures are needed for protecting both patients and staff members [12] .",
