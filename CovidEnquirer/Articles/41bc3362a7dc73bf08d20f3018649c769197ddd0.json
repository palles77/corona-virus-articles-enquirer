Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts. The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6\u00b74 days (95% CI 5\u00b72-7\u00b77). The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. The estimated case fatality rate was 13\u00b72% (9\u00b78-16\u00b78) for patients younger than 60 years and 43\u00b73% (35\u00b72-52\u00b74) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric \u2425 distribution. A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6\u00b78% (4\u00b70-9\u00b76) and 55\u00b70% (45\u00b73-64\u00b77), respectively.

We describe the epidemiology in Hong Kong in the first 9 weeks of the epidemic, during which 1425 cases were confirmed, and 122 deaths from SARS occurred.

Primary health care in Hong Kong is provided by private practitioners (80%) and general outpatient departments operated by the public sector. The Hospital Authority also currently provides 95% of total inpatient bed-days. 3 The Department of Health provides the public-health function, including the monitoring and control of communicable diseases. 4 The eSARS system is designed as a registry and monitoring system. All patients admitted for investigation and observation into the SARS cohort wards in all the hospitals under the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong are recruited on entry. The patients on the registry are progressively classified into: patient under observation, patient suspected of SARS, patient with confirmed SARS, and not SARS. The criteria for inclusion in the eSARS register as a patient confirmed with SARS are radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, and current fever higher than 38\u00baC or history of such at any time in the past 2 days, and at least two of the following: history of chills in the past 2 days, cough (new or increased) or breathing difficulty, general malaise or myalgia, and known exposure. Patients are listed as suspected of having SARS if they do not fulfil this definition but are still thought to be likely cases of SARS on the basis of the collective evidence and clinical judgment. However, patients are excluded if an alternative diagnosis can fully explain their illness.",

The analysis of the onset-to-admission interval shows that over time there has been a progressive shortening of the time from clinical onset of symptoms to presentation at hospital. The estimation of case fatality rates in the situation of an emerging epidemic is not straightforward. First, our estimates are derived from data on clinical cases that have been admitted to hospital and, hence, estimate the mortality rate only in this population. Second, the temporal evolution of the epidemic complicates analysis. Finally, the estimates of the case fatality may vary dependent on the methods used and their underlying assumptions, although the estimates we present have statistical validity.

On physical examination he was alert and had no focal neurological deficit. Severe meningism caused noticeable opisthotonic fixation of the neck. Computed tomography (CT) of the cerebrum suggested subarachnoidal haemorrhage with subtle blood in the perimesencephalic cisterns, beneath the tentorium, and in the fourth ventricle. Routine CT angiography, digital subtraction angiography of the four cerebral vessels, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the craniocervical junction did not show a bleeding focus. The combination of persistent opisthotonus and radiological subarachnoidal haemorrhage strongly suggested a bleeding source, and motivated further investigation. MRI of the neuraxis revealed an arteriovenous malformation of the medullary cone dorsal from vertebral corpus L1 (figure). The current finding extends the routine diagnostics for intracranial subarachnoidal haemorrhage without focus to MRI of the entire neuraxis. Endovascular treatment of the malformation is considered for this patient.Clinical picture",
