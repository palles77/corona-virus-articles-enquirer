Study design: All pregnant women (12) who presented with SARS in Hong Kong between February 1 and July 31, 2003, were included. The pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were collected. Evidence of perinatal transmission of virus was assessed with the SARS-associated coronavirus reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on cord blood, placenta tissue, and subsequent follow-up of the neonate on serology. Results: Three deaths occurred among the 12 patients, giving a case fatality rate of 25%. Four of the 7 patients (57%) who presented in the first trimester had spontaneous miscarriage. Four of the 5 patients who presented after 24 weeks were delivered preterm. Two mothers recovered without delivery, but their ongoing pregnancies were complicated by intrauterine growth restriction. No newborn infant had clinical SARS and all investigations were negative for SARS. Conclusion: SARS during pregnancy is associated with high incidences of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. There is no evidence of perinatal SARS infection among infants born to these mothers.",

There is no published information on the outcomes of pregnant women infected with SARS. Given the significant maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality of most viral pneumonia in pregnancy, SARS may impose greater risk in pregnant compared to nonpregnant individuals. We reported the pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of all pregnant women affected during the outbreak in Hong Kong.",

Medical treatment was offered to the patients while maternal and fetal conditions were closely monitored. Indications for early delivery included maternal deterioration, failure to maintain adequate oxygenation or difficulty with mechanical ventilation because of the gravid uterus, fetal compromise or other obstetric indications. Daily cardiotocography (CTG) was performed for pregnancies after 28 weeks of gestation. Fetal growth was assessed by serial ultrasound scans every 2 weeks.

A 1-cm cubic of fresh placenta tissue was removed after it had been thoroughly rinsed with sterile saline solution and dissected from the chorionic plate. The remaining placenta tissue was sent for histopathology and/or electron microscopy, particularly searching for viral inclusion bodies or particles.

In the current series, more patients required ICU admissions (50%) and mechanical ventilation (33%) compared with the nonpregnant adult population (20% ICU admission). 8 This poor outcome could be ascribed to the physiologic changes in pulmonary function during late pregnancy. The gravid uterus has been shown to elevate the diaphragm by up to 4 cm in the third trimester, while oxygen consumption is increased by 20% in pregnancy and functional residual capacity is decreased, rendering the woman intolerant to hypoxia. 12 Fifty-seven percent of our patients had spontaneous miscarriage, which was higher than the 15% to 20% widely reported early pregnancy loss rate. 13 The increased miscarriage risk was unlikely to be due to transplacental infection, as there was an absence of viral particles in the products of conceptions. Severe maternal respiratory failure and hypoxemia may disrupt uterine placental flow and cause miscarriage. Ribavirin is a commonly used first-line medication for the management of SARS in Hong Kong. Six patients had ribavirin, and a significant embryocidal effect has been observed in rabbits and mice, it may be possible that during this anembryonic stage ribavarin was the cause of spontaneous miscarriage. 14, 15 There are no human data for early pregnancy use and such postulation needs further confirmation. Ribavirin was also associated with significant teratogenic effects in animal studies. 14, 16 Patients who decide to use ribavirin in early pregnancy should be given the option for termination of pregnancy.",

Other fetal/neonatal complications include IUGR, intrauterine demise, and neonatal death. 17 ,18 IUGR appears to be a common sequel among our patients who carried on with their pregnancies. This might be due to the severe maternal respiratory illness affecting the oxygen supply to the fetuses. These patients had frequent episodes of oxygen desaturation, often falling below 90%. The situation resembles that of those living at high altitudes, causing a low arterial partial pressure of oxygen 19, 20 and consequent IUGR. The general impact of a severe maternal debilitating illness on fetal growth also needs to be considered. The placental findings of placental infarction (patient 9) indicate maternal thrombosis, and the avascular villi (patients 8 and 9) suggest fetal thrombosis. There was also significant placental weight reduction relating to the duration of SARS before delivery (Table III) . Again, these changes were likely to represent complications of the hypoxemia and circulatory insufficiency in both the mother and fetus as a result of SARS. The observed fetal growth restriction is unlikely to be due to hydrocortisone or methyl-prednisolone, as neither steroid crosses the placenta readily. The risk of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV was low, as there was no evidence of the presence of virus/viral particles in the products of conception or the infants. Direct contact with maternal body fluid that contained SARS-CoV put the infants at high risk of perinatal infection. Preventive measures at delivery, such as performing nasopharyngeal suction before first breath and cleansing the infant soon after birth, might help to reduce the viral load. It was a fortunate finding from our cohort that there was no evidence of vertical transmission, despite close contact with SARS virus. Indeed, there should be a theoretical advantage of delaying delivery in these patients to avoid the exposure of these infants to the virus at birth. The passage of maternal SARS-CoV antibodies across the placenta to the fetal circulation should have additional protective effect on the fetus/neonate. Nevertheless, it was our experience that the timing of delivery was frequently dictated by the deteriorating maternal condition.",
