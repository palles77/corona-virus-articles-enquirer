Concerns arise not only over the possibility of disease induction in vaccinated individuals, particularly those who are immune compromised, but also over spread of the vaccine virus in the population. These issues are perhaps most evident in the efforts to develop a vaccine against HIV, where the target populations are likely to include some individuals already infected with HIV and perhaps immune suppressed as a result of their infection. Yet, nowhere is the urgency of vaccine development greater than in the AIDS field. In this chapter replicating and non-replicating viral vectors will be discussed with the focus largely on AIDS vaccine research, where a spectrum of both types of vector, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages, is under development. Review of several in each category will illustrate issues faced in vector selection.",

Yet as vectors, both exhibit not only genetic instability but also small insert capacity [2] , limiting interest for vaccine development. Features of various viral vectors and recent results following their use will first be reviewed followed by a consideration of issues faced in vector selection.

The virology and molecular biology of the double-stranded DNA virus were heavily investigated for years as part of gene therapy applications, providing an invaluable knowledge base for further development in the vaccine arena. Several Ad features are particularly attractive for vaccine use, including infection of both dividing and non-dividing cells, high levels of transgene expression, ability to grow to high titers in vitro, lack of integration in the host genome, and physical and genetic stability. Importantly, Ad infect dendritic cells, upregulate co-stimulatory molecules, and elicit cytokine and chemokine responses, thus effectively presenting antigens to the immune system and eliciting potent immune responses [3] . As Ad target epithelial cells, they are prime candidates for elicitation of mucosal as well as systemic immunity. Ad vectors have been designed for a broad spectrum of vaccine applications, including not only HIV and SIV but also multiple DNA and single and double-stranded RNA viruses [4 ] .",

Such vectors generally have the non-essential E3 region deleted as well, in order to create more space for foreign genes. An expression cassette is then inserted with the transgene under the control of an exogenous promoter. Ad5 has been the most extensively developed non-replicating Ad vector. As one of the first viral vectors to be applied in HIV vaccine research, its potential for eliciting strong cellular immune responses to the inserted gene was quickly noticed. Its recognition as an important vector and potential vaccine candidate was established with the finding of better protection against experimental infection of non-human primates with a chimeric SIV/HIV virus (SHIV) compared to animals immunized with plasmid DNA or an MVA recombinant expressing the same SIV gag gene [5] . As pre-clinical studies with this vector advanced, the contribution to protective efficacy of HIV and SIV gene inserts in addition to gag in the Ad5 vectors was illustrated [6, 7] . Combination approaches, especially incorporating priming with improved plasmid DNA vaccines to focus immune responses on the gene product of interest followed by a boost with an Ad-recombinant expressing the same gene product were shown to enhance Replicating and non-replicating vaccine vectors Robert-Guroff 547 protective efficacy [8, 9] . Upon moving to studies in humans, early clinical trials demonstrated that the nonreplicating Ad-recombinant HIV vaccines, alone or in combination with DNA, were both safe and immunogenic [10, 11] , leading to further large scale human trials as discussed later in this review.",

Eventually a level of anti-vector immunity was reached that prevented further infection by the therapeutic vector and hence expression of the inserted gene product. It is not known whether pre-existing or vaccine-induced vector immunity would decrease the effectiveness of a vaccine if it only needed to be administered a limited number of times. Nevertheless, in view of the high prevalence worldwide of Ad5-seropositive people, alternative vectors are being developed as vaccine vehicles. These include Ads of rare serotype such as Ad11, Ad26, Ad35, and Ad49 [4 ] that can be used in sequential prime-boost regimens to avoid or lessen the impact of pre-existing immunity as well as cross-reactivity between Ad serotypes [13] , non-human Ads of chimpanzee origin [14] , and engineered chimeric vectors in which the hypervariable regions of the hexon protein of Ad5, for example, targeted by Ad neutralizing antibodies, are replaced with corresponding regions of a rare Ad serotype such as Ad48 [15 ] . An additional Ad vector based on Ad41 that exhibits gut tropism is being developed, and may prove useful as an oral mucosal vaccine without needing an enteric coating for protection against stomach acid [16] . These alternative Ad vectors will require safety testing and their relative immunogenicity in comparison to Ad5 will need to be clearly established. Overall, they should provide flexibility in prime/boost regimens, and focus the immune response on the inserted gene while avoiding anti-vector immunity induced by prior immunizations.",

This leaves only the terminal ITRs to allow high level expression of the inserts. The vector infects muscle cells and provides long lasting expression from either episomal or integrated genomic forms. As a non-enveloped vector, AAV exhibits physical stability; in particular its resistance to acid suggests a potential use in oral delivery. Production of the vector presents difficulties, however, as helper functions must be provided in trans, requiring subsequent purification away from the helper virus. Integration of the vector is also a potential safety concern, although a recent report suggests AAV integrates no more frequently than naked DNA [24] . Further, although AAV serotype 2 is ubiquitous and therefore might be poorly immunogenic in target populations exhibiting prior immunity, alternative serotypes are available. AAV type 5 in particular has been shown to exhibit higher tropism for both mouse and human dendritic cells than AAV2, and to elicit potent cellular and humoral responses in mice [25] .",

Generally, to circumvent safety concerns, alphavirus vectors are engineered as non-replicating replicon particles in which structural gene products are deleted to accommodate a foreign gene of up to 5 kb, while structural proteins are provided in trans from two helper transcripts that lack a packaging signal. Deletion of the structural genes provides a further advantage in reducing immunity to the vector and enabling sequential immunizations. Importantly, the vector is naturally targeted to dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes, where the transgene is expressed at high levels, leading to good immune responses [31] . Immunogenicity is further enhanced as the self-amplification of the vector RNA occurs through double-stranded RNA intermediates that stimulate activation of the interferon cascade, mimicking innate immunity. The vector also induces apoptosis in some cell types, thereby leading to cross-priming [32] . Recent research results suggest potentially new applications for alphavirus vectors, as they can be engineered to secret proteins encoded by the transgenes, and additionally, can be designed to express heterologous proteins on the surface of infectious virus particles [33] . Notably, phase I human trials of VEE vector-based HIV vaccines have been conducted [34 ] with a further trial to test VEE expressing HIV clade C envelope, gag, nef, and pol genes planned to start in 2008 [35 ] . [36] . A combination approach involving priming with VEE/SIN replicons encoding HIV and SIV genes followed by boosting with HIV envelope protein elicited both cellular immunity and neutralizing antibodies and resulted in significantly lower acute viremia following exposure to SHIV SF162P4 , suggesting the potential of this vector should be further explored [37] .",

Additionally, HSV-1 activates TLR2 for induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and TLR9 for induction of type I interferons [38 ] .

In clinical trials, ALVAC-HIV recombinants have been shown to be safe; however, they have elicited only modest HIVspecific cellular immune responses. In fact, a phase 2 study of a multigenic ALVAC-HIV vaccine candidate followed by boosting with recombinant gp120 failed to elicit a CD8+ CTL frequency of 30% in healthy volunteers, as evaluated by IFN-g secretion, and therefore was not advanced to a proof-of-concept trial designed to investigate correlates of protective immunity [52] . Nevertheless, a related phase III efficacy trial of an ALVAC recombinant expressing HIV Env of clade B and E together with Gag and Pol, followed by boosting with clade B and E gp120, is underway in Thailand [34 ] . Whether the inclusion of vaccinia E3L and K3L genes in the earlier ALVEC vector, intended to improve antigen expression and presentation, may have instead inhibited apoptosis and other IFN-induced effects, thereby influencing antigen presentation and limiting cross-priming, may be able to be discerned from the current phase III trial in which the ALVAC vector lacks these two genes.",

However, in NYVAC/MVA combination strategies, initial priming with the NYVAC recombinant followed by the MVA recombinant gave the broadest cellular immune response. By contrast, the weaker response of the NYVAC recombinant as a booster immunogen may reflect anti-vector immunity elicited by the significantly smaller MVA vector. In this case, the immune response would be focused on a smaller number of common genes present in both NYVAC and MVA, leading to greater inhibition of the NYVAC booster immunogen. The increased breadth of cellular immunity elicited by the NYVAC vector could be linked to its greater induction of apoptosis, leading to a greater abundance of antigens available for cross-priming.

However, with the report of Rose et al. [56] of significant protection against a SHIV 89.6P challenge following two sequential immunizations of rhesus macaques with recombinant VSV vectors expressing HIV envelope and SIV Gag, the vector became a prominent vaccine candidate. In addition to its promise in the HIV/AIDS vaccine field, it has been shown effective as a vaccine vehicle for such lethal viral infections as Ebola and Marburg viruses in non-human primates [57] and pandemic influenza in mice [58] . Advantages of the vector include its replication in the cytoplasm, thus avoiding integration into host DNA, a high level of transgene expression due to shutting down host mRNA translation, ease of production due to a rapid life cycle, limited pre-existing immunity in the population, and ability to be administered mucosally. The natural hosts for VSV infection are insects and livestock. In rare cases where the virus has been transmitted to humans, it has been asymptomatic, or caused only mild symptoms. Nevertheless, as a replicating vector, it has been vigorously investigated for safety. VSV has been found to be neurovirulent in rodents and also non-human primates following direct intracranial inoculation. And although intranasal administration of recombinant VSV to macaques did not result in spread to the central nervous system, intrathalamic inoculation resulted in severe neuropathology [59] . As a result the vector is being aggressively attenuated to meet safety criteria, while at the same time efforts to increase the immunogenicity of the weakened vector are explored. These include increasing transgene expression by shifting the position of the transgene from the 5 0 end of the genome to the 3 0 end, co-expressing immune modulators, targeting of dendritic cells, and combination strategies with other vector delivery systems [55 ] . In fact, the benefit of priming rhesus macaques with plasmid DNA expressing SIV Gag together with DNA encoding IL-12, followed by intranasal boosting with VSV recombinants expressing HIV Env and SIV Gag resulted in enhanced cellular and humoral immune responses and reduced viremia following challenge with SHIV 89.6P compared to macaques that received the VSV recombinant only [60] . Whether the further attenuated vector will meet safety criteria or whether a non-replicating VSV vector will be developed more fully in order to continue to exploit the other attractive features of this viral vector will be determined by the outcome of future studies. A non-replicating VSV vector, lacking the VSV glycoprotein essential for infectivity has been designed as a vaccine for hepatitis C virus [61] .",

A recently reported sero-prevalence study for several potential Ad vectors of different serotypes revealed a strong age-dependence of Ad5 neutralizing antibodies. Infants exhibited very low anti-Ad5 titers; however, the titers increased rapidly, so that by age 12-18, nearly 50% of individuals had neutralizing titers over 1000 [62] .

A manufacturing strategy able to provide vaccine for use in millions of people worldwide is also an important consideration. A system for large scale production must be available, and the viral recombinant must be genetically stable in order to maintain its integrity through multiple passages in order to reach desired quantities of vaccine material. Additionally, global use of a vaccine implies use in the developing world where cold storage and sophisticated equipment for vaccine administration are not always available.

The human trial in question addressed the issue of whether a vaccine designed to elicit T cell immunity would be protective against HIV infection and/or would help control disease progression in individuals that became infected. Neither outcome was achieved. At present, it is not known whether the vectored vaccine simply did not induce sufficient T cell immunity; whether it elicited the wrong type of cellular immunity; or whether the concept that T cell immunity alone would be sufficient to protect against HIV was incorrect. Answers to the first two questions will emerge as data from the trial undergo analysis to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine and investigate if it induced the quantity and quality of cellular immunity desired. By contrast, the answer to the third question will probably not be known until a successful vaccine is achieved and immune correlates of protection are identified. However, the concept that a solely T cell based vaccine would protect against HIV infection was probably overly optimistic, just from a consideration of the kinetics of infection and the time necessary for memory T cells to encounter antigen, replicate, differentiate to effector T cells, and migrate to the source of infection to provide immune protection. The failure of the T cell based vaccine to modulate the HIV viral load following infection was an unexpected result, however, and may relate to the levels of systemic and mucosal cellular immunity elicited and the type of immune cells induced. Yet the disappointing outcome of the trial does not mean that a cellular component in a future vaccine is not necessary. It only suggests that it is not sufficient by itself. Other components that are probably essential include antienvelope antibodies, mucosal immunity, and engagement of the innate immune system: in short, an approach that brings all components of the immune system into play.",

Live, attenuated SIV vaccines have demonstrated highly effective protection against virulent SIV challenge in non-human primates [64] , although use of similarly attenuated HIV vaccines in people is not possible because of safety concerns. Yet the features of the live attenuated approach are probably simulated most closely using a replicating vector. As published previously [65] , a replicating vector stimulates the immune system similarly to a natural infection, with characteristic features including prolonged expression of inserted genes, therefore favoring more persistent immunity; induction of pro-inflammatory cytokings and co-stimulatory molecules that function as adjuvants; in vivo replication providing a greater effective dose and greater immunogenicity; and natural targeting according to cell and tissue tropism.

            "text": "The idea that an initial priming immunization with a replicating recombinant vector will be important for an HIV vaccine is supported by the report that boosting of mucosal immunity by an inactivated poliovirus vaccine depends on first being immunized with the live, oral poliovirus vaccine [66] . Administration of the inactivated vaccine first is less effective in eliciting a strong mucosal response. This concept needs to be tested in an appropriate animal model. However, it suggests that following initial priming with a replicating vector, either replicating or non-replicating vaccine vectors could be used as booster immunogens. Such combination approaches, using sequential immunizations with a homologous vector, perhaps of a different subtype to avoid vector-induced immunity, or with a heterologous vector, may be highly efficient at focusing the immune response on the inserted gene product, thus enhancing the overall immune response.",

While vector priming can provide T cell help for B cell responses, in order to induce broad and potent antibodies, a booster inoculation with a protein antigen is generally necessary. Alternatively, some viral vectors such as alphavirus can be engineered to elicit potent antibody responses [67] , and might prove to be a useful alternative.",

The scheme takes advantage of the innate immune system in amplifying the adaptive immune response made to the initial antigen exposure upon immunization and ultimately should elicit strong cellular, humoral, and mucosal immunity to the target antigens. Additional and significant challenges, however, must still be met, including identification of the best combination of gene inserts for the vectored vaccines, and design of a protein booster immunogen for elicitation of the broadest and most potent neutralizing antibodies possible.",

In mice, chimeric vectors in which VEE contributes the replicon component and SIN the envelope glycoprotein packaging components have been shown to elicit as potent immune responses as VEE itself, with both being superior to SIN or a SIN-VEE chimera containing the SIN replicon component and VEE packaging components[32]. The greater responses induced by VEE may relate to greater levels of in vivo replication or the resistance of VEE to alpha and beta interferons. Subsequent studies in macaques demonstrated that the chimeric VEE/SIN vectors elicited more potent systemic and mucosal immune responses to an inserted HIV envelope gene product compared to the SIN vector",
