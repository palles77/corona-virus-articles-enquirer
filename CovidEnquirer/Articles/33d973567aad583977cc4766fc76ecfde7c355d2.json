The cattle were infected through direct contact with an experimentally inoculated calf. All experimental cattle shed faecal BCV with development of diarrhoea, being profusely watery with small amounts of blood in the most severely affected animals, including both cows and calves. The cows, in contrast to the calves, showed depressed general condition and appetite leading to a marked decrease in milk yield. Further age-associated differences were a shorter incubation period in the two youngest calves, but with milder fever and milder decrease in white blood cell counts. These \u00aendings shed light on the apparent epidemiological differences between WD and calf BCV diarrhoea suggesting that, (1) the same strains of BCV cause natural outbreaks of calf diarrhoea and WD, (2) seronegative cows are more severely affected by the infection than seronegative conventionally reared calves, and (3) unaffected Veterinary Microbiology 81 (2001) 127\u00b1151",

All cattle developed high IgM antibody responses and long-lasting IgA antibody responses both systemically and locally. The serum IgM antibody responses came earlier in most of the calves than in the cows. Prolonged IgM antibody responses were detected in serum and milk, while those in nasal secretions were much shorter. BCV-speci\u00aec IgA was present in nasal secretions from all cattle throughout the 6 months follow-up. The IgA antibody response in serum was detected up to 17 months post-infection and the duration showed an age-related variation indicating a more prominent IgA memory in the adult cattle and in the older calves than in the younger ones.

The early experiments (reviewed by Kruiningen et al., 1985) were performed before the etiological role of bovine coronavirus (BCV) was elucidated, and since the BCV antibody status of the animals could not be determined it is conceivable that clinical disease was inconsistently produced. Recently, WD reproduction was attempted in BCV seropositive cows, but diarrhoea could only be produced by inoculation through a duodenal catheter after immunosuppression using serial dexamethasone injections and/or large amounts of iced water orally (Tsunemitsu et al., 1999) .",

Yet, in WD outbreaks calves often are clinically unaffected (Rollinson, 1948; Hedstro \u00c8m and Isaksson, 1951; Roberts, 1957; Tra \u00cave \u00c2n et al., 1993) . Antigenic differences between BCV strains isolated from diarrhoeic calves and from cows with WD have been sought in experimental cross-protection studies (Reynolds et al., 1985; El-Kanawati et al., 1996) , as well as in vitro by use of panels of antisera and monoclonal antibodies applied in functional and cross-reactivity tests (Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995; Dea et al., 1995) , complemented with sequence analysis of the haemagglutinin esterase gene (Milane et al., 1997) . However, no consistent differences between cow-and calf-derived BCV strains have been found so far. The objective of this experiment was to reproduce WD in BCV-seronegative lactating cows and to infect milkfed BCV-seronegative calves with the same strain of the virus and to compare the outcome between the cows and the calves with respect to clinical disease, faecal excretion of the virus, isotype-speci\u00aec antibody and interferon type 1 responses in serum, milk and nasal secretions.",

Concentrate was offered even on days with watery diarrhoea. During the clinical study period, the calves were fed hay ad libitum and 2 l of fresh milk 3 times daily, except the oldest calf (107) that was fed 2.5 l twice daily and one meal of a calf starter concentrate. The milk fed during the entire clinical study period was BCV antibody negative, derived from the experimental cows before infection and stored at \u00c0208C until needed. The milk was served at body temperature. On days with moderate to watery diarrhoea, depending on the severity of the diarrhoea, 1\u00b13 meals of milk were replaced by an electrolyte solution, but no calf was completely without milk for more than 1 day. Blood samples were drawn from the ventral tail vein of the cows and from the jugular vein of the calves using sterile evacuated tubes. Milk samples were collected from a front quarter showing a low cell count level. On each cow the same quarter was sampled every time. Nasal secretions were collected using cotton tampons that were inserted into one nostril and allowed to absorb for 10\u00b130 min to obtain at least 1.5\u00b12 ml. The\u00afuid was then pressed out of the tampon using a sterile 20 ml syringe. Faecal samples were taken from the rectum when the cattle had diarrhoea and when faeces were not passed during the examination, and otherwise from the freshly laid faeces.

A 3-month-old BCV-seronegative conventionally reared SRB calf (306) was used as source of virus (transmitter calf) for the experimental animals (Table 1) . At a location 5 km from the experimental unit, calf 306 was orally and intranasally inoculated with a 50% faecal suspension in phosphate buffered saline. 100 ml of the suspension were given through a stomach tube and 3 ml instilled in each nostril. Two days after inoculation, calf 306 was brought to the experimental unit and kept for 1 h in each of the cows' pens. Then the four experimental calves were kept together with calf 306 for 1 h in a cow-size pen. Each experimental animal had direct nose contact with calf 306 and each animal also had nose contact with faeces from calf 306. After the contact the calves were put back into single pens and calf 306 was removed from the experimental unit.

Many similarities in the disease outcome and some differences were seen between the cows and the calves. Experimental evaluation of BCV infections is hampered by the dif\u00aeculties to \u00aend seronegative cattle constituting an immunologically relatively homogeneous group. All cattle used in this experiment were seronegative to BCV. The contribution of predisposing factors to outbreaks of WD has been widely assumed (Campbell and Cookingham, 1978) . In this experiment, however, there were no obvious predisposing events, e.g. adverse weather: the infection was done in the beginning of May; stress: the cows were installed and accustomed to the ration several weeks before the trial; preceding infections: the mild respiratory infection and the sinusitis occurred well in advance of the trial.",

BCV faecal shedding also was detected in all the calves. Among the advantages of this virus transmission model is that the virus infectivity and virulence are better retained by the use of a faecal sample instead of a cell cultured inoculum. Virus grown in cell culture goes through a selection and adaptation process where virulence and pathogenecity factors promoting the infection in vivo may be modi\u00aeed. For example, the cell culture passaged virus widely used in experimental BRSV infections have caused much milder symptoms than those described after natural infections Elvander et al., 1998) . The second main advantage of this trial design is that the use of an experimentally inoculated transmitter calf mimics the natural way of transmission as closely as possible, ensuring that the virus reaches the proper host cell and that the host response to infection follows the scheme of a natural infection. This is of particular importance, since the mode of transmission in natural WD is not fully known. By keeping the experimental cattle as a herd in a shared stable unit, the model allows for circulation and recirculation of BCV, which may be an important feature of the natural BCV disease, since BCV is a highly contagious infection. The model, however, depends on the transmitter calf effectively propagating the virus. The use of a group of transmitter calves would compensate for individual differences and further improve the model.",

The transmitter calf was much more physically active when inside the pens of the two cows that developed the most severe diarrhoea than when it was in contact with the two less affected cows. Physical activity of both carrier and recipient with frequent contacts is likely to increase the viral dose transmitted by aerosol and by oral/nasal contact with nasal secretions and faeces of the carrier calf. Differences in activity were not obvious in the calf group and differences in severity of the calf disease may, apart from viral dose, be linked to age, since severe BCV calf diarrhoea is usually described only during the \u00aerst weeks of life (Torres-Medina et al., 1985; Mo \u00c8stl, 1990) .

These results concur with previous reports of a BCV-strain isolated from adult cows with WD causing diarrhoea in colostrum-deprived and gnotobiotic calves (El-Kanawati et al., 1996) . The calf diarrhoea seen in this experiment was more frequent and more severe than is usually reported from WD outbreaks. The BRV infection probably contributed to the severity of the diarrhoea in the youngest calf, which excreted BRV during the diarrhoea. Also, the preceding BRV infection, although subclinical, may have aggravated the diarrhoea elicited by the BCV infection in the other calf that developed watery diarrhoea. The BRV infection in these calves underlines the multifactorial pathogenesis of neonatal calf diarrhoea, possibly explaining the variable diarrhoea frequency in young calves in natural WD outbreaks. The feeding of BCV antibody negative milk during the entire clinical study period may also have contributed to a more pronounced calf diarrhoea in this experiment than in natural WD outbreaks (Tra \u00cave \u00c2n et al., 1993) . Most Swedish dairy calves are raised on a milk replacer, usually containing a moderate level of BCV-speci\u00aec IgG1 antibodies (Tra \u00cave \u00c2n, unpublished observations). Frequently supplying such antibodies into the gut lumen may convey partial local immunity.",

These results suggest that seronegative conventional calves, even without being fed speci\u00aec milk antibodies, are less severely affected by a BCV infection than seronegative cows. The difference in disease possibly re\u00afects differences in intestinal virus replication and cell destruction between lactating cows and calves, which may be in\u00afuenced by the ration, a \u00aeeld for further research. Unaffected general condition in BCV-infected calves, as in this experiment, probably leads to an underestimation of the calf diarrhoea frequency in natural WD outbreaks reported (Rollinson, 1948; Hedstro \u00c8m and Isaksson, 1951; Roberts, 1957; Tra \u00cave \u00c2n et al., 1993) . This study supports the view that the same strains of BCV cause WD and calf diarrhoea outbreaks.

In experimental infections of calves, weak faecal BRV-speci\u00aec IgM was \u00aerst detected on 5 dpi (BRV, Saif and Smith, 1985) , and serum and local BRSV-speci\u00aec IgM on 6 dpi (Kimman et al., , 1989 Westenbrink and Kimman, 1987) . Contributing to early detection is a sensitive test. These very early IgM antibodies, only detected in calves, may signify an initial T cell independent response. A potent innate immune system has been shown in neonatal rodents and humans in contrast to the low capacity for T cell dependent antibody responses (Marshall-Clarke et al., 2000) . Further, viruses of several different types and families, and possessing repeated antigenic determinants, elicit T cell independent IgM responses in mice (Bachmann and Zinkernagel, 1996) .",

The correlation between age and the duration of the serum IgA antibody response (Table 3) con\u00aerms previous \u00aendings (Na \u00c8slund et al., 2000) , probably re\u00afecting a more ef\u00aecient induction of IgA memory in the cows compared with the calves and in the older calves compared with the younger ones. Interestingly, IgA antibodies were maintained in nasal secretions from all cattle throughout the 6-month study period, but the protective value is dif\u00aecult to assess since such studies are lacking. The low and sporadic occurrence of BCV-speci\u00aec IgG in nasal secretions indicates minimal serum transudation, caused by sampling or in\u00afammation, con\u00aerming the local origin of the consistently detected IgA response. The late occurrence (6\u00b17 wpi) of the highest speci\u00aec IgA values (``2nd peak'' in Table 5 ) in nasal secretions of three cows and one calf may indicate prolonged viral replication or recirculation of the virus within the experimental herd. The contribution to this \u00aending by variations in total IgA content due to dilution through increasing amount of nasal secretions seems less likely, because nasal discharge during the early IgA antibody response was observed in both cows and calves. Also, the only cow showing markedly increased nasal secretions had the highest level of BCV-speci\u00aec nasal IgA. Some investigators relate the level of speci\u00aec IgA to total IgA for quanti\u00aecation and comparison of speci\u00aec IgA responses in secretions (Hordnes et al., 1997; Berstad et al., 1997) to circumvent an unknown dilution factor introduced by the sampling. In this study the tampon sampling technique was used, resulting in undiluted secretions, therefore the level of speci\u00aec IgA should be more comparable between samples.",

These \u00aendings concur with the ef\u00aecient IFN induction shown in vivo for another coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine (Bonnadie \u00c1re and Laude, 1981) and in vitro for many coronaviruses, including BCV (Baudoux et al., 1998) . Fever and leucopenia are rapidly occurring, reversible side-effects of IFN type 1 treatment in humans (Quesada, 1992) . In this experiment fever, leucopenia and the EVF decrease strikingly coincided with the serum IFN peak, indicating that these symptoms may be mediated by IFN. The low IFN level detected in serum of the youngest calf on the day of BCV infection was probably induced by the rotavirus infection (Broecke et al., 1984) . The weak second IFN peak in serum or nasal secretions from some cattle may indicate recirculation of BCV within the group. IFN detection in bovine milk has not been reported previously, to the authors' knowledge. Detectable milk IFN titres were retained for 6 days in three out of four cows, but the low level of the response, probably due to dilution, may limit utilisation of milk IFN as an infection marker.",

The BRSV seroresponses, on the other hand, were more divergent (seroconversions on days 9\u00b128), indicating a slower transmission of BRSV within the experimental herd or a delayed replication of, or response to, BRSV caused by the BCV infection as previously shown with BVDV (Elvander et al., 1998) . Furthermore, there was no difference in the non-speci\u00aec responses (or in the clinical outcome) between the two cows that seroresponded early to BRSV and the two that responded more than 1 week later. Concerning the capacity of respiratory syncytial viruses to induce interferon type 1, Elvander et al. (1998) failed to detect IFN in serum of calves experimentally infected with BRSV, concurring with the poor IFN inducing capacity shown by human RSV in vitro (Roberts et al., 1992) and in vivo (Collins et al., 1996) . The rotavirus infection may have contributed to the IFN response detected in the calf shedding BRV during the diarrhoea, but not in the other calf, since BRV shedding stopped before the IFN was detected. These two calves showed neither fever, nor leucopenia. The decrease in milk yield occurred simultaneously in all the cows, indicating that it was brought about by the BCV infection. The BRSV infection possibly prolonged the subnormal yield level somewhat in the cow that showed more pronounced respiratory symptoms, but no obvious in\u00afuence was seen comparing the individual yield recovery (Fig. 2) .",

Co-infections or sequential infections with other enteric pathogens, like the rotavirus infection in some of the calves in this study, probably are important under \u00aeeld conditions for the development of severe calf diarrhoea from BCV infection. This assumption is in accord with the well-established multifactorial etiology of neonatal calf diarrhoea.",
