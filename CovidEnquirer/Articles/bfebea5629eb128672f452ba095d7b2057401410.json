One study of viral coinfection using standard culture methods as well as serological and molecular detection methods determined increased rates of hospitalizations in children with dual respiratory virus infections. However, this study occurred before the recent discovery of some respiratory viruses including human metapneumovirus 3 and relied on relatively insensitive culture methods. The impact of multiple viruses on the severity of clinical illness is unclear. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Several studies that focused primarily on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and \u2044 or human metapneumovirus documented increased hospitalization and intensive care admissions 6, 8, 10 or more prevalent fever 14 with viral coinfections, while other reports found no association of multiple viruses with respiratory illness severity. 12, 13, 15, 16 To correlate clinical disease severity and viral load in children with single and multiple virus detections, we analyzed nasal wash samples and reviewed charts of children evaluated for respiratory disease in a single pediatric center ",

ICD-9 discharge and admission codes were grouped using the Complex Chronic Condition categories previously described by Feudtner et al. 21 with the addition of a group for asthma (519AE1, 493AE0-493AE9). Multivariate linear regression (for continuous outcomes) and logistic regression (for binary outcomes) were used to compare clinical correlates of disease severity between children with single virus illnesses and multiple virus illnesses. Regression analyses controlled for age and for the presence of chronic underlying conditions. The association between multiple viruses and clinical correlates was also evaluated for consistency between age groups and within children with chronic underlying conditions. To support our findings, we examined associations with clinical severity individually for each virus (RSV coinfections versus RSV alone, for example). A two-sided P value of 0AE05 or lower was considered to be statistically significant. Analyses were performed using STATA version 10.1 (College Station, TX, USA).",

In contrast, RSV, Flu A, PIV 3, and hMPV viral loads were consistently high whether or not another virus was detected. These results were generally not affected by adjustment for age and presence of chronic disease, with the exception of PIV3. In a subanalysis of children with underlying chronic conditions, PIV3 viral quantity was significantly lower in multiple virus illnesses than in single virus illnesses (5AE4 versus 8AE0, P < 0AE01) in this group. Children with single virus illnesses had higher rates of severe clinical disease compared with children with multiple virus infections.

In contrast, we found that rates of fever and abnormal radiographic findings were similar between children with single and multiple virus illnesses. The relationships in our study between multiple virus detection and clinical disease were consistent across age groups and both healthy and chronically ill children. Notably, we found the highest prevalence of multiple virus infection among children 6-23 months of age. While younger infants (birth to 5 months of age) are undergoing exposure to their first viral season and are likely experiencing a primary infection, these older children (6-23 months) may be more likely to have had previous exposures to these respiratory viruses in an earlier season. Perhaps, the increased severity 22 and heightened immune response during a primary infection in the youngest children may discourage colonization by a second viral pathogen, leading to lowered prevalence of multiple viruses in this youngest group.",

For example, RSV, FluA, hMPV, and PIV3 were present at consistently high quantities regardless of the presence of other viruses in the sample. By contrast, the viral load for PIV 1 and AdV differed substantially depending on whether single or multiple viruses were detected. These associations may offer insight into which virus predominates in a multiple virus illness. Notably, 82% of coinfections consisted of one virus from the group with consistently high viral load (RSV, Flu A, hMPV, or PIV3) combined with an alternate virus (CoV, PIV 1, or AdV). This may suggest a possible model for virus coinfections that include one predominant virus and one virus that is present at a lower quantity and does not confer increased severity. The presence of lowquantity CoV and AdV in a coinfection merits further study, especially given the finding that the prevalences of these two viruses in asymptomatic individuals are second only to rhinovirus. 16, 23, 24 Similar to our findings, Canducci et al. reported a lower prevalence of multiple virus illnesses in the youngest infants and an increased severity of disease (as measured by increased hospital stay and prevalence of hypoxia) in RSVonly illnesses compared with those with both RSV and hMPV detected. 4 However, our results are in contrast to several studies which found increased hospital admissions, 3,5 intensive care unit admissions, 9, 10 and duration of hospitalization and need for supplemental oxygen, 6 or, recently, increased presence of fever 14 for illnesses with multiple virus detections compared with those with single virus detections. Some of these differences may be attributed to variation in the age ranges studied 3, 10 or the restriction to specific respiratory illnesses 5, 14 or to RSV or RSV \u2044 hMPV coinfection in particular. 6, 10, 14 Other studies have reported no association between respiratory illness severity and multiple virus detections, 7,12,13 including very recent reports. 15, 16 It is, perhaps, counterintuitive that the presence of multiple species at a single time point is not associated with more severe disease. An immune response to an infection with the first virus could modify the disease severity of a subsequently acquired virus, potentially by the induction of interferon and other anti-viral response modifiers. While our sample size was too small to determine whether our results reflect the number of viruses detected or the characteristics of specific virus combinations, we found our estimates to be largely consistent when stratified by virus, although not statistically significant.",

Our study design precluded identifying incident viral infections, limiting our ability to define acquisition of each virus in relation to symptom onset. Similarly, the course of the illness prior to presentation and collection of the respiratory specimen could not be reliably verified. Although viral load generally decreases from illness onset, 25 our study was able to compare viral loads at the time of illness symptoms that warranted medical attention. The total number of viral coinfections was likely underestimated because we did not evaluate the presence of rhinovirus and bocavirus, viruses known to be associated with prolonged viral shedding and detection during both symptomatic and asymptomatic periods. 24, 26, 27 Thus, some cases of single infection in our study could be classified as multiple infections in studies which include these viruses. We were unable to determine rhinovirus viral load because of the large number of serotypes present, making it difficult to differentiate asymptomatic shedding from active infection. We believe these particular pathogens are better studied in prospective settings where baseline viral shedding can be examined. 24 We also did not assess potential bacterial pathogens, although the comparable rates of antibiotic use between the two study groups ( Table 2 ) indicated that suspected or documented bacterial infection is an unlikely confounder.",
