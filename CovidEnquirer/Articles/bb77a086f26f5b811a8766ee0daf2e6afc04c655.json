In brief, after a 48-h quarantine period, healthy volunteers were challenged with rhinovirus type 2 and, 1 h later, with rhinovirus strain EL. Those who developed colds between 36 and 84 h after challenge, selfadministered placebo or NPC 567 (2.5 mg/ml), 0.2 ml to each nostril, six times a day until the end of the trial, a maximum of five days. A member of staff supervised the administration. The spray contained sodium chloride 0.6% (w/v) citric acid 0.022% sodium citrate 0.7% in distilled water and was preserved with methyl paraben 0.18% and propyl paraben 0.2%; the placebo consisted of the vehicle without the drug. Randomisation was only partial in those trials which included females in order to ensure that those at risk of pregnancy would receive only placebo. Volunteers remained in isolation throughout and were assessed clinically every day. Nasal washings for virus isolation were collected daily commencing 36 h after virus challenge. Blood samples for haematological and biochemical tests wele collected from all volunteers before entry into the trial and again, from those who had received medication, at the end of the trial. In order to evaluate any transient relief of symptoms that might result from medication, volunteers were asked to assess the severity of their own colds as well as the four symptoms: blocked nose, runny nose, sore throat and cough, on an analogue 10 cm scale graduated from 0 to 100. Assessments were made immediately before and again one hour after the 11 am dose of medication each day; the second assessment was made on an identical scale adjacent to the first.",

Such changes were more common in the placebo group with 21 instances among the 193 (11%) assessments and all but one signified a beneficial effect. There is little evidence that NPC 567 produced a consistent short term effect in any volunteer, often an improvement on one day being counterbalanced by deterioration on another. Placebo had a more consistent effect and was generally beneficial. However, it is interesting to note that 13 of the 21 substantial changes occurring among placebo recipients were reported by just two subjects and probably relates more to the personality of the volunteer than the medication.

Therefore, the majority or all of the clinical score and nasal secretion weight on day 1 has been acquired before medication commences. After medication had started the colds in those receiving drug were more severe than those in the placebo group although the differences were statistically significant on only one occasion -the mean nasal secretion weight on day 6. The greater severity of the colds in the drug group can be attributed to increased nasal secretion as can be seen when the contribution of the tissue count is deducted from the clinical score (see Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, the volunteers' own assessment showed no evidence of a specific short termed beneficial effect of NPC 567 although there was a placebo effect. Approximately 70% of the self-assessed changes were considered to be beneficial in both groups.

Concentrations of 10 -s M have been shown to inhibit bradykinin-mediated effects in animal models (unpublished) . NPC 567 has only 10% of the binding capacity of bradykinin to which the receptors would already have been exposed when a cold becomes clinically apparent and so place the drug at a distinct competitive disadvantage. It might be inhibited by some component of nasal secretion but no biological inhibitors are known at the moment.
