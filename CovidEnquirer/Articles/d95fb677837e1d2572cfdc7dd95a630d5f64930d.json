There has been limited discussion in the nursing literature about the concept of global health diplomacy or the role of nurses in such initiatives. A discussion of this concept is presented here by the members of a Task Force on Global Health Diplomacy of the American Academy of Nursing Expert Panel on Global Nursing and Health (AAN EPGNH). The purpose of this article is to present an integrative review of literature on the concept of global health diplomacy and to identify implications of this emerging field for nursing education, practice, and research. The steps proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) were adapted and applied to the integrative review of theoretical and descriptive articles about the concept of global health diplomacy. This review included an analysis of the historical background, definition, and challenges of global health diplomacy and suggestions about the preparation of global health diplomats. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for nursing practice, education, and research. The Task Force endorses the definition of global health diplomacy proposed by Adams, Novotny, and Leslie (2008) but recommends that further dialogue and research is necessary to identify opportunities and educational requirements for nurses to contribute to the emerging field of global health diplomacy.",

The American Academy of Nursing Expert Panel on Global Nursing and Health (AAN EPGNH), whose members are active participants in the global arena, recognize that health problems transcend national borders and that all nurses must be prepared to address global health challenges. Since 2007, global health has become the top foreign policy issue of our times (Labont\u00e9 & Gagnon, 2010) , encouraging the interaction of state and nonstate participants to position health issues more prominently in foreign policy decision-making. This process and the engagement of all key stakeholders are parts of a new approach to global health called \"global health diplomacy\" (Labont\u00e9 & Gagnon, 2010) . Nurses who work in the global health arena need to be aware of this new emphasis and identify their responsibilities as global health diplomats.",

To better inform nurses about the concept of global health diplomacy, this paper presents an integrative review of literature on the concept of global health diplomacy and identifies implications of this emerging field for nursing education, practice, and research. Whittemore and Knafl (2005) described an integrative review of the literature as the broadest type of research review, combining data from both empirical and theoretical literature to define concepts, review evidence, review theories, and analyze methodological issues. Those authors modified the original framework for literature reviews proposed by Cooper (1998) and suggested that an integrative review should include: (a) a clear statement identifying the problem or purpose of the review; (b) identification of the strategies used to search and identify relevant literature; (c) evaluation of the quality of the data; (d) analysis of the data; and (e) final synthesis and presentation of the data. Whittemore and Knafl (2005) acknowledged that many strategies can be used for each of these stages. The purpose of this review was to analyze the concept of global health diplomacy and identify implications of global health diplomacy for nursing practice, education, and research. The framework proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) was used to organize the review. We did not find reports of empirical research other than descriptions of existing health-diplomacy programs, so our review focused on theoretical articles and empirical descriptions of global health initiatives. The articles included in this review were identified by searching the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PubMed databases using the search term \"global health diplomacy,\" without specifying any date restrictions. Additional articles were identified by reviewing reference lists of the original papers, and by searching Google Scholar using the keywords \"global health diplomacy.\" Empirical or theoretical articles were included in the review if they addressed the historical development of global health diplomacy, defined the components and challenges of health diplomacy, proposed future development of global health diplomacy, and/or discussed strategies for preparing global health diplomats.",

To analyze and synthesize the data from these diverse sources, the authors reviewed all papers, wrote annotated summaries of each paper, and then developed a system for classifying the articles, displaying the data, comparing the themes that emerged from each paper, and drawing inferences and conclusions, using the methods proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) . The review is organized according to the main themes that emerged from analysis of the papers: historical development of global health diplomacy, definition and components of global health diplomacy, challenges in global health diplomacy, and preparation of global health diplomats.

Global health emphasizes transnational health issues, determinants, and solutions; involves many disciplines within and beyond the health sciences and promotes interdisciplinary collaboration; and [it] is a synthesis of population based prevention with individual-level clinical care\" (Koplan et al., 2009 (Koplan et al., , p. 1995 . Adams, Novotny, and Leslie (2008) defined global health diplomacy as \"an emerging field that addresses the dual goals of improving global health and bettering international N u r s O u t l o o k 6 1 ( 2 0 1 3 ) 8 5 e 9 2 relations, particularly in conflict areas and in resourcepoor environments\" (p. 316). Katz et al. (2011) proposed that the varying definitions of global health diplomacy fall into three different categories (1) core diplomacy or formal negotiations between and among nations; (2) multi-stakeholder diplomacy or negotiations that are not necessarily intended to lead to binding agreements; and (3) informal diplomacy or interactions between international public health actors and their counterparts in the field, including host country officials, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), private-sector companies, and the public. Identifying these different categories of global health diplomacy may be important to clarify services/resources that may be offered, especially when governments argue for incorporating health issues into their foreign-policy debates (Kaufmann & Feldbaum, 2009) .",

The Healthy People 2020 document outlines the U.S. objectives for meeting this new global health goal to address continuing emerging disease threats: promote health abroad, prevent the international spread of disease, and protect the health of the U.S. population. Badeau (1970) described the historical evolution of the concept of \"medical diplomacy,\" noting that centuries ago physician-priests sometimes accompanied Egyptian missions to neighboring countries and acted as ambassadors. He also noted that the nature of diplomacy changed following World War I and that diplomacy is no longer the purview of only a small elite corps of professional diplomats. Factors such as improved communication, educational levels, an end to colonial rule in many parts of the world, and increased public demand for civic participation has resulted in changes in the face of diplomacy. Fidler (2001) suggested that health diplomacy emerged because of global threats to public health in the 19 th century. The Marshall Plan, the end of the Cold War era, and the medical assistance provided by the U.S. military in Europe and Japan following World War II signaled increased emphasis on the importance of foreign aid and \"persuasion\" as a key component of foreign diplomatic initiatives in both the U.S. and in other countries (Adams, et al., 2008; Badeau, 1970) . Feldbaum, Lee, and Michaud (2010) noted that global health has historically been of importance in foreign policy as evidenced by the international sanitary conventions that began in 1851. These international sanitary conventions subsequently evolved into the International Health Regulations (IHR), focused on enforcing disease control with minimum interference with international trade (World Health Organization, 2005) . Feldbaum et al. (2010) suggested that although the World Health Organization (WHO) has had problems enforcing IHRs in the past, the 2003e2004 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) resulted in revision of IHRs and granted the WHO authority to supersede interests of member states using surveillance data for purposes of infectious disease control. Those authors further described the historical link between international aid and foreign policy interests, which was a key factor in the 1961 establishment of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).",

Cahill (1974) called for \"the diplomatic potential of medicine as a vehicle for international goodwill\" (p. 190). Subsequently, Cahill (1997) introduced the term \"preventive diplomacy,\" noting that diplomats and politicians frequently lack an understanding of the health and humanitarian issues that they address and challenged health professionals to become active in addressing global health and human rights issues to offer innovative approaches to health and human rights issues that may be more effective than the methods used in the past. Katz, Kornblet, Arnold, Lief, and Fischer (2011) noted that the concept of medical diplomacy was first introduced in the Carter administration in 1978, as a \"vehicle by which channels of communication can be established between nations when international relations are strained or severed\" (p. 121). Feldbaum et al. (2010) noted three recent trends in international aid to address health issues: (a) dramatic increase in funding for health; (b) increased number of organizations involved; and (c) a tendency to focus on HIV/AIDS as a single health problem. Others have also noted the increase in health-related aid and the increased international focus on HIV/AIDS (Ravishankar et al., 2009; Shiffman, Berlan, & Hafner, 2009) . Other factors that have contributed to the growing interest in global health diplomacy include the growth of NGOs participating in international health programs, the increasing globalization of science and of pharmaceutical research, and growing concerns about biosecurity (Adams, et al., 2008, p. 315) .",

Other authors have also identified this challenge, particularly when aid that is tied to political ends addresses basic human needs such as food or health. In addition, focusing on health as a political instrument often limits the ability of global health initiatives to address priority health problems in a sustainable way (Feldbaum, et al., 2010; Institute of Medicine, 2009a; Kickbusch & Buss, 2011; Kickbusch, Silberschmidt, & Buss, 2007) . Ingram (2005) identified three potential problems with the use of health as a foreign policy tool: (a) decreasing the credibility of health workers who have previously been viewed as neutral and not involved with state politics; (b) giving priority to narrow state interests over the interests of alliances needed to address global health issues; and (c) focusing on health as a political instrument rather than a human rights issue.",

An example of this conflict was Indonesia's refusal in 2006 to share influenza virus samples with the WHO Collaborating Centers on influenza that traditionally receive samples from around the world for analyses to be used in development of new vaccines. Indonesia's refusal was based on the perception that the vaccines would be used to benefit only wealthier nations and would not benefit Indonesia (Katz, et al., 2011) . Many writers have emphasized the importance of coordination of global health initiatives by groups such as the World Health Assembly (Chan, et al., 2008; Kickbusch & Buss, 2011; Novotny, 2006) .",

Wilson et al. (2010 Wilson et al. ( , 2012 adapted these competencies for nurses, and surveyed nursing faculty in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America to identify their perceptions about whether the adapted competencies were appropriate for nurses. The competencies are divided into six broad categories: (a) global burden of disease; (b) health implications of travel, migration, and displacement; (c) social and environmental determinants of health; (d) globalization of health and healthcare; (e) healthcare in low resource settings; and (f) health as a human right and development resource. Survey responses were received from 561 nursing faculty members in the U.S. and Canada and from 56 nursing faculty in Latin America, indicating general agreement that the 30 competencies identified in these categories were important and appropriate for inclusion in nursing curricula. Although there is a need for further research to refine and validate these competencies, the survey results can be used to guide development of curricula to prepare nurses to contribute to addressing global health problems.",
