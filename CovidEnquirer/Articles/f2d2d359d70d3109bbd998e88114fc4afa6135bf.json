Calves were orally inoculated at 6 days old with either rotavirus (5), ETEC (7), rotavirus and ETEC (5) or remained uninoculated controls (4), and their reactions were recorded by clinical, microbiological, and pathological observations. Rotavirus infection consistently produced diarrhoea, while ETEC inoculated alone did not colonise the intestine. In dual infections, both rotavirus and ETEC multiplied, although the severity of diarrhoea was not greater than that caused by rotavirus alone. Some ETEC-inoculated calves developed subsequent naturally-acquired rotavirus infections, but in these no ETEC multiplication occurred. The results suggest that prior or simultaneous rotavirus infection is necessary to enable ETEC colonisation of the intestine in conventional calves of this age.",

            "text": "Several enteropathogens, including rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) have been implicated commonly in the aetiology of neonatal calf diarrhoea (Acres et al., 1975; Morin et al., 1976; Moon et al., 1978; De Leeuw et al., 1980) . ETEC infections occur most commonly in calves in which diarrhoea commences by 3 days of age (Acres et al., 1975; Moon et al., 1978) and experimentally it has been possible to produce diarrhoea, with ETEC, only in calves under 48 h old (Smith and Halls, 1967) . On the other hand, rotavirus infections occur mainly in calves from 4 days to several weeks of age (Acres et al., 1975 , Moon et al., 1978 de Leeuw et al., 1980) . However, combined natural infections with rotavirus and ETEC do occur (Acres et al., 1975; Morin et al., 1976; Moon et al., 1978) although the significance of such 0378-1135/82/0000--0000/$02.75 \u00a9 1982 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company combined infections is equivocal. Although most field studies have not detected any interaction (Acres et al., 1975; Moon et al., 1978) , an increased severity of decrease has been suggested by Morin et al. (1976) . Experiments in gnotobiotic calves have shown both a synergistic interaction producing a fatal disease (Gouet et al., 1978) , and an interaction in which rotavirus aided ETEC colonisation but with little disease enhancement (Runnels et al., 1980) . However, experiments with gnotobiotic animals exaggerate the ability of microorganisms to colonise the intestine, and the interaction of two organisms can more realistically be studied against the background interaction with a normal gut flora. Preliminary experiments by Tzipori et al. {1981) showed that rotavirus and ETEC inoculated together into conventional calves produced a more severe diarrhoea than that caused by either agent alone. The present study was therefore undertaken to investigate the interaction of rotavirus and ETEC in the production of diarrhoea in conventionally-reared calves aged 6 days.",

Thus in gnotobiotic calves ETEC readily colonise the intestine, and rotavirus infections enhance this colonisation. However, in conventional calves in this ex-periment ETEC ,colonisation occurred in the presence of rotavirus infection while ETEC were eliminated in the absence of rotavirus infection.
