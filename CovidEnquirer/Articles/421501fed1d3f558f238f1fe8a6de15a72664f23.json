Th1 and Th2 cytokine profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured throughout in the experiment. No clinical signs of FIP were evident in the experimental cats after immunization. After challenge, the immunized cats demonstrated one of four clinical outcomes: (1) classical effusive FIP; (2) accelerated FIP; (3) non-effusive FIP, or (4) resistance to challenge. Only minor cytokine changes were observed following immunization, however, several cytokine changes occurred following challenge-exposure. The most noteworthy changes were in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and interferon gamma (IFN-) levels. Our preliminary findings suggest that immunity against FIP is associated with TNF-and IFN-response imbalance, with high TNF-/low IFN-mRNA responses favouring disease and low TNF-/high IFN-mRNA responses being indicative of immunity.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a highly fatal disease in Felidae caused by a coronavirus and usually affects cats between 6 months and 3 years of age (reviewed by Pedersen, 1995) . The FIPV is a common mutant of the far more ubiquitous and largely non-pathogenic feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Pedersen, 1987a; Vennema et al., 1998) . The enteric virus is highly tropic to the mature epithelium of the small intestine, whereas the mutant FIPV gains a tropism for macrophages. This macrophage tropism allows the virus to disseminate throughout the body and is responsible for pathogenicity (Stoddart and Scott, 1989 ). The disease presents in two major forms: (1) an effusive form associated with peritonitis and/or pleuritis and vasculitis, and (2) a non-effusive form characterized by more classical granulomatous disease of major abdominal organs, uveal tract, and meninges (reviewed by Pedersen, 1995) . Both forms of the disease are uniformly lethal, with affected cats dying over several days to many months. Immunity to FIPV is presumed to be cellular (Pedersen, 1987b) , as is typical of highly cell-associated pathogens (Tizard, 2000) . Antibody responses, by themselves, are actually harmful by facilitating virus uptake by macrophages and participating in Arthus like reactions (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980) . Therefore, whether a cat develops wet or dry FIP is thought to depend on the strength of the cat's cell-mediated immune response. Cats producing a negligible cell-mediated response and a strong antibody response rapidly develop acute wet FIP. Cats producing a partial cell-mediated response develop the chronic form of the disease. There is strong circumstantial evidence that susceptibility to FIP has a significant genetic component (Foley et al., 1997) .",

Animal-passaged FIPV-UCD8 usually kills from 90-100% of inoculated cats, almost always from effusive FIP (NC Pedersen, UC Davis, unpublished information). In this study, two of eight vaccinated cats (nos 524 and 625) appeared immune to challenge-exposure with virulent FIPV-UCD8 and two (nos 623 and 624) developed non-effusive FIP (indicative of partial immunity; Pedersen, 1995) . Three immunized cats (nos 522, 616, and 622) died of the classical form of effusive FIP, indicating a predominance of non-protective humoral immunity. One cat (no. 527) developed a highly accelerated form of effusive FIP, indicating that immunization had elicited enhancing type antibodies (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980) . Therefore, immunization induced a spectrum of immune effects, ranging from protection (two cats), partial immunity (two cats), typical humoral immunity (three cats), to antibody enhancement (one cat). This reflects past experiences with attenuated live FIPV vaccines (McArdle et al., 1995; Pedersen and Black, 1983; Scott et al., 1995) .",

In contrast, immune cats failed to upregulate TNF-mRNA and one manifested strong IFN-mRNA responses.

Cats infected with the avirulent FIPV only showed transient fevers (data not shown) and low to negligible changes in cytokine mRNAs in PBMCs. The cat that had the most pronounced primary cytokine responses was also the animal that developed the most severe febrile reaction to the vaccine. This indicated that changes in cytokine mRNAs within PBMCs were only noticeable when reactions within internal lymphoid organs reached a certain threshold, thus allowing the responses to spill over into the blood. This was also observed after challenge-exposure. Cats that became very sick with FIP tended to have marked upregulation of cytokine mRNAs in their PBMCs. A dichotomy in responses was seen between the two cats that were immune to challenge exposure with virulent FIPV-UCD8. Cat no. 524 developed weak cytokine reactions during immunization and strong cytokine responses following challenge-exposure, while cat 625 showed very little changes during either immunization or challenge-exposure. This suggested that cat no. 524, while being immune, was none the less infected by the challenge virus and did mount a vigorous secondary immune response (at the cytokine, but not antibody level). In contrast, cat 625 appeared to develop exceptionally strong protective immunity from the onset, precluding the need for a systemic response. Therefore, the magnitude and duration of cytokine mRNA responses in PBMCs does not always correlate with strength of immunity. ",

MHV, like the feline coronaviruses (Horzinek et al., 1995) , exists in two biotypes, a naturally occurring and largely enterotropic biotype and a more laboratoryassociated polytropic biotype (Homberger et al., 1998) . The enterotropic biotype of MHV is analogous to FECV, while polytropic biotypes have many parallels with FIPV. The similarities between feline and murine coronaviruses and their biotype-associated diseases were quickly noted following the creation of IFN-deficient mice. IFNknockout mice developed severe peritonitis, identical to FIP, upon experimental challenge with a polytropic MHV (Kyuwa et al., 1998a (Kyuwa et al., , 2002 and this disease could be partially inhibited with exogenously administered IFN- (Kyuwa et al., 2002) . This supports our findings on the importance of IFN-mRNA responses in cats exposed to FIPV. A granulomatous peritonitis and pleuritis has also been described in a colony of IFN-knockout mice infected naturally with enterotropic MHV (France et al., 1999) . This latter observation parallels what is seen in a group of retrovirus immunocompromised cats exposed to FECV (Poland et al., 1996) . Other similarities exist between murine and feline coronavirus infections. Age and genetic factors have been shown to play a role in naturally occurring MHV infection, with 1 week olds being more susceptible than 3 and 12 weeks, and Balb and ICR mice more susceptible than SJL mice (Barthold, 1987) . Age and genetic susceptibility have been shown to be important risk factors for FIP in purebred cats (Foley et al., 1997; Foley and Pedersen, 1996) . The central question coming out of this preliminary experiment and previous MHVrelated studies concerns the role of IFN-in FIPV immunity.",

Cats developing FIP after challenge-exposure failed to demonstrate IFN-mRNA responses in PBMCs, but did make high levels of TNF-mRNA.
