Objectives: We aimed to investigate the incidence and outcomes of severe HMPV-associated CAP and to compare them with those of severe IFV associated CAP. Study design: From March 2010 to August 2017, all consecutive adult patients with severe HMPV-associated CAP and severe influenza virus (IFV)-associated CAP who required intensive care unit admission were prospectively identified and followed in a 2,700-bed tertiary care hospital. The characteristics and outcomes of severe HMPVassociated CAP patients were compared with those of severe IFV-associated CAP patients. Results: HMPV and IFV were identified in 3.2% (50) and 7.0% (109) of the 1559 patients with severe CAP, respectively. The mortality rates were not significantly different between the HMPV and IFV groups (30-day mortality: 24.0% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.30; 60-day mortality: 32.0% vs. 38.5%, p = 0.43). Oral ribavirin therapy was not associated with improved outcome (60-day mortality: ribavirin therapy group 35.0% [7/20] vs. no ribavirin therapy group 30.0% [9/30], p = 0.71). Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in mortality among non-immunocompromised (60-day mortality: HMPV 25.6% vs. IFV 31.1%, p = 0.55) and immunocompromised patients (60-day mortality; HMPV 54.5% vs. 54.3%, p = 0.99). The length of ICU and hospital stay did not differ between groups. Conclusions: The incidence of HMPV infection was approximately half that of IFV infection in a cohort of patients with severe CAP. The mortality rate of severe HMPV-associated CAP was similar to that of severe IFV associated CAP.",

All patients aged \u226516 years admitted to the medical ICU with severe CAP from March 2010 to August 2017 were included. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center. Using a standardized protocol, investigators prospectively collected detailed data on demographics, comorbidities, medications, clinical and laboratory findings, the severity of illness score, management, and outcome information. The microbiological evaluation was performed as described previously [7, 8] : respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and bronchoscopic lavage (BAL) fluids, and the microorganisms identified from specimens collected \u2264 72 h after hospital admission were considered CAP pathogens. The main outcome was all-cause 60-day mortality. The characteristics and outcomes of severe HMPV-associated CAP patients were compared with those of severe IFV-associated CAP patients. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the presence or absence of immunocompromised condition [9] . Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. p values of < 0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows version 23.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, New York).",

Overall, rhinovirus was the most commonly identified virus (7.7%, n = 120), followed by influenza virus (7.0%, n = 109), parainfluenza virus (4.6%, n = 71), human coronavirus (3.6%, n = 56), respiratory syncytial virus (3.3%, n = 52), and HMPV (3.2%), n = 50). Table 1 lists the characteristics of the enrolled patients. The median ages of the HMPV group and the IFV group were 70.0 years and 68.0 years, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, structural lung disease, malignancy, and end-stage renal disease were the most common underlying diseases in both groups. Of these, diabetes mellitus was significantly more common in the HMPV group (38.0% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.03). Eleven patients (22.0%) in the HMPV group and 35 (32.1%) in the IFV group were categorized as immunocompromised, respectively (p = 0.19). Fever (> 38\u00b0C) tended to be more common in the IFV group (p = 0.07). Otherwise, the initial manifestations were similar between the groups. Co-pathogens were less commonly found in the HMPV group (30.0% vs. 48.6%, p = 0.03). The detailed composition of co-infections is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The most common dominant radiology pattern was bronchopneumonia in both groups (66.0% vs. 57.8%, p = 0.33). Supplementary Figure 1 shows the monthly distribution of HMPV and IFV cases during the study period. Severe HMPV and IFV-associated CAP occurred predominantly from January to June and December to April, respectively. This finding was consistent with the observed pattern of HMPV and IFV incidence in the community. Of 50 HMPV patients, 20 (40.0%) were administered oral ribavirin therapy for more than 48 h, and 5 were administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Six patients were administered IVIG therapy alone.",

Almost all patients with severe IFV-associated CAP received antiviral therapy, either oseltamivir or peramivir, whereas only 40.0% (20/50) of HMPV patients received antiviral therapy. The presence of end-stage renal disease (n = 8) or chronic renal failure (n = 5) may prohibit the use of ribavirin [10] . Furthermore, there has been no proven effective therapy for HMPV pneumonia. Oral ribavirin alone or in combination with IVIG was not beneficial for HMPV patients in our study. The similar mortality rates between the two groups, despite a lack of effective antiviral therapy in HMPV patients, indicate that the virulence potential of HMPV might be lower than that of IFV. Larger controlled studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of antiviral therapy and virulence potentials of HMPV infection.",

Recently, Hwang et al. retrospectively analyzed the risks of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality following HMPV infection in hospitalized adults [6] . The inhospital mortality rate among 22 ARDS patients was 36.4%, which is similar to that noted in our study. They included some immunocompromised patients and cases of hospital-acquired infection. Because the mortality rates of those patients were not analyzed separately, it was difficult to directly compare these mortality rates with our results. Another study included 40 HMPV-positive patients admitted to the ICU [5] . The overall mortality was 18.0%. The proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation (55.0%) was lower than that in our study (90.0%). None of these prior studies included control groups for comparison. Because the characteristics and outcomes of IFV-associated pneumonia have been well-documented, we compared the outcomes between severe HMPV-associated CAP and IFV-associated CAP patients. We combined the IFV-A and IFV-B subgroups and used it as control group in our analysis. The outcomes of the IFV-A and IFV-B subgroups may be different. We provided outcome data for each group in Table 2 . When we compared the outcomes between the IFV-A and IFV-B groups, the differences were not significant (data not shown). However, considering the small number of IFV-B cases, this issue should be investigated in further studies.",
