            "text": "Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) encodes a trypsin-like proteinase (3C-like proteinase) by ORF 1a, which has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in proteolytic processing of gene 1-encoded polyproteins. In our previous studies, the proteinase was identified as a 33-kDa protein in IBV-infected cells, and its catalytic center was shown to consist of H 2820 and C 2922 residues. It is released from the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins by autoprocessing at two Q-S dipeptide bonds (Q 2779 -S 2780 and Q 3086 -S 3087 ). In this report, further characterization of the two cleavage sites demonstrates that the N-terminal Q 2779 -S 2780 site is tolerant to mutations at the P1 position. Deletion of the C-terminal region of the proteinase shows that a significant amount of the enzymatic activity is maintained upon deletion of up to 67 amino acids, suggesting that the extreme C-terminal region may be dispensable for the proteolytic activity of the proteinase. Analysis of the autoprocessing kinetics in vitro reveals that proteolysis at the Q 2779 -S 2780 site is the first cleavage event mediated by this proteinase. This is followed by cleavage at the Q 3086 -S 3087 site. The occurrence of both cleavage events in intact cells is potentially rapid and efficient, as no intermediate cleavage products covering the proteinase were detected in either IBV-infected or transfected cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies further show differential subcellular localization of the proteinase in IBV-infected cells and in cells expressing the 3C-like proteinase alone, indicating that additional roles in viral replication might be played by this protein. Finally, a Q-A (Q 3379 -A 3380 ) dipeptide bond encoded by nucleotides 10,663 to 10,668 was demonstrated to be a cleavage site of the proteinase.",

The proteolytic activity of the proteinase could be inhibited by a variety of cysteine and serine inhibitors and was eliminated by the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E64d (Lu et al., 1996; Pinon et al., 1997; Seybert et al., 1997) . More recently, immunofluorescence studies using region-specific antisera against several 1a and 1a/1b cleavage products including the 3C-like proteinase have suggested that the proteinase may be associated with the viral RNA replication-transcription machinery (Schiller et al., 1998; Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999; Shi et al., 1999; Denison et al., 1999; van der Meer et al., 1999) .",

The proteinase was shown to be self-cleaved from the polyproteins at the two previously predicted Q-S dipeptide bonds (Q 2779 -S 2780 and Q 3086 -S 3087 ) in an in vitro processing assay (Tibbles et al., 1996) . The in vitro proteolytic activity was shown to be strictly dependent on the addition of canine microsomal membranes (Tibbles et al., 1996) . Here, we show, by deletion and mutational analyses, that the N-terminal cleavage site of the 3C-like proteinase is tolerant to mutations and the extreme C-terminal region may be dispensable for the enzymatic activity. The proteinase could be selfcleaved to the 33-kDa mature form in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate without the addition of canine microsomal membranes. Immunofluorescence staining and cellular fractionation studies demonstrated that the proteinase is associated mainly with the membrane fraction in virus-infected cells. However, a free distribution pattern was observed when the proteinase was overexpressed in intact cells. Finally, instead of the previously predicted Q 3365 -G 3366 dipeptide bond, the Q 3379 -A 3380 dipeptide bond was identified as a cleavage site of the proteinase.",

Substitution mutagenesis was carried out to investigate the effects of mutations on the self-cleavage efficiency of the proteinase at this position. The Q 2779 -S 2780 dipeptide bond was first mutated to E 2779 -S 2780 , giving rise to pIBV9\u232c1Q 2779 -E (Fig. 1a) . Expression of pIBV9\u232c1Q 2779 -E led to the detection of three protein species (Fig. 1b, lane 2) . In addition to the 33-kDa protein, two products of approximately 43 and 48 kDa, respectively, were also detected (Fig. 1b, lane 2) . The 43-kDa protein may represent a fusion product containing the 33-kDa protein and the product encoded by nucleotides 8693 to 8865, and the 48-kDa protein may represent the full-length product encoded by this construct (Fig. 1a) . As a significant amount of the 33-kDa protein was detected from the expression of this construct (Fig. 1b, lane 2) , this result indicates that an E-S dipeptide could be used efficiently by the 3C-like proteinase at this position. Substitution of the Q 2779 residue with a K was then carried out, giving rise to pIBV9\u232c1Q 2779 -K (Fig. 1a) . Expression of this construct resulted in more efficient detection of the 43-and 48-kDa products (Fig. 1b, lane 3) . However, a trace amount of the 33-kDa protein was still detected (Fig. 1b, lane 3) . These results suggest that cleavage at the Q 2779 -S 2780 dipeptide bond may be tolerant to mutations and the Q to E substitution is better tolerated than the Q-K substitution.",

Expression of pIBV9Q 3086 -E led to the detection of a novel product with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa (Fig. 2b, lane 2) . No 33-kDa protein was observed (Fig. 2b, lane 2) . This was unexpected, as no further cleavage site was predicted to be located 30-60 bp downstream of the Q 3086 -S 3087 dipeptide bond. To investigate the possibility that the C-terminus of the 35-kDa protein may be derived from a novel cleavage site located 10 to 20 amino acid residues downstream of the Q 3086 residue, two deletion plasmids, pIBV9Q 3086 -E\u232c1 and pIBV9Q 3086 -E\u232c2, were constructed. As can be seen in Fig. 2a , the IBV sequence present in pIBV9Q 3086 -E\u232c1 The Q 2779 -S 2780 , Q 3086 -S 3087 , Q 3379 -A 3380 , and Q 3462 -S 3463 scissile bonds and viral products generated from cleavage by the 3C-like proteinase are indicated. Also shown are the IBV sequence recognized by anti-3C, the stretches of hydrophobic residues encoded by ORF1a and the IBV sequences present in pIBV9, pIBV9\u232c1Q 2779 -E, and pIBV9\u232c1Q 2779 -K. The viral products generated from cleavage by the 3C-like proteinase and the full-length products encoded by some plasmids are illustrated. The molecular masses of these products were estimated according to their migration on SDS-PAGE. The Q 2779 -S 2780 , Q 3086 -S 3087 , Q 3379 -A 3380 , and Q 3462 -S 3463 residues are encoded by nucleotides 8863-8868, 9784-9789, 10,663-10,668, and 10,912-10,917, respectively. (b) Mutational analysis of the Q 2779 -S 2780 dipeptide bond. Plasmids pIBV9, pIBV9\u232c1Q 2779 -E, and pIBV9\u232c1Q 2779 -K, respectively, were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells using the vaccinia-T7 expression system. Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine-cysteine, lysates were prepared, and polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with anti-3C. Gel electrophoresis of the polypeptides was performed on an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel and polypeptides were detected by fluorography. was terminated at nucleotide position 9911. Expression of this construct, once again, led to the detection of the 35-kDa protein (Fig. 2b, lane 3) . Meanwhile, a novel product migrating more slowly than the 35-kDa protein was also detected (Fig. 2b, lane 3) . Its apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa suggests that it is a fusion product containing the 35-kDa protein and the product encoded by nucleotides up to 9911. pIBV9Q 3086 -E\u232c2 was constructed by introducing a UGA termination codon immediately downstream of the Q 3086 residue (Fig. 2a) . Interestingly, expression of this plasmid led to the detection of a single protein species comigrating with the 35-kDa protein processed from pIBV9Q 3086 -E\u232c1 (Fig. 2b, lane 4) , suggesting that the E 3086 residue is actually the C-terminus of the 35-kDa protein expressed from pIBV9Q 3086 -E and pIBV9Q 3086 -E\u232c1. These results demonstrate that mutation of the Q 3086 residue to an E only marginally reduces the cleavage efficiency occurring at the Q 3086 -S 3087 dipeptide bond, but alters the mobility of the 33-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE.",

As can be seen, a 35-kDa product representing the C-terminally truncated form of the 3C-like proteinase was detected in both cases (Fig. 2b, lanes 6 and 7) . No full-length product was observed from the expression of pIBV9\u232c19 (Fig. 2b , lane 6), but a trace amount of the full-length product was detected from the expression of pIBV9\u232c20 (Fig. 2b, lane 7) . Progressively less enzymatic activity was observed when pIBV9\u232c21 and pIBV9\u232c22 were expressed. In each case, two products representing the full-length proteins and the C-terminally truncated 3C-like proteinase were detected (Fig. 2b , lanes 8 and 9). Expression of pIBV9\u232c23 showed the detection of the full-length product only (Fig. 2b , lane 10), indicating that the catalytic activity was abolished by this deletion. These results suggest that the extreme C-terminal region is not essential for the catalytic activity of the 3C-like proteinase.",

The viral products generated from cleavage by the 3C-like proteinase and the full-length products encoded by some plasmids are illustrated. The molecular masses of these products were estimated according to their migration on SDS-PAGE. The Q 3086 residue is encoded by nucleotides 9784-9786. (b) Mutational and deletion analyses of the Q 3086 -S 3087 dipeptide bond and the C-terminal region of the 3C-like proteinase. Plasmids pIBV9, pIBV9Q 3086 -E, pIBV9Q 3086 -E\u232c1, pIBV9Q 3086 -E\u232c2, pIBV9\u232c19, pIBV9\u232c20, pIBV9\u232c21, pIBV9\u232c22, and pIBV9\u232c23, respectively, were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells using the vaccinia-T7 system. The cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine-cysteine, lysates were prepared, and the labeled polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with anti-3C. Gel electrophoresis of the polypeptides was performed on an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel and polypeptides were detected by fluorography. (Lu et al., 1996; Pinon et al., 1997; Schiller et al., 1998; Heusipp et al., 1997a) . However, the microsomal membranes were shown to be indispensable for the in vitro activity of the IBV 3C-like proteinase (Tibbles et al., 1996) . To clarify this discrepancy, plasmid pIBV1a7\u232c1, which covers nucleotides 7999 to 9786 and contains the upstream hydrophobic region (M1), was expressed in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and pulse-chased for up to 8 h. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time and the reactions were stopped by the addition of RNase A. The 33-kDa protein was detected after incubation for 1 h and its expression steadily increased toward the end of the time course (Fig. 3) . The expression of the fulllength 54-kDa protein meanwhile decreased rapidly over time (Fig. 3 ). The addition of microsomal membranes did not significantly increase the autoprocessing rate of the 33-kDa protein (data not shown). These results demonstrate that autoprocessing of the IBV 3C-like proteinase could occur in vitro in reticulocyte lysate in the absence of the membranes.",

It was interesting to note that immunofluorescence staining of viral infected cells using anti-3C antiserum showed distinct punctuate perinuclear staining patterns (Schiller et al., 1998; Shi et al., 1999; Denison et al., 1999; van der Meer et al., 1999) , suggesting that the proteinase may be associated with intracellular membranes. To study the subcellular localization patterns of the IBV 3C-like proteinase, the proteinase was tagged to an 11-amino-acid T7 tag (MASMTGGQQMG) derived from the major capsid protein of bacteriophage T7, and a highly specific anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen) was used to stain cells overexpressing the fusion protein. This procedure is used to avoid the high background of the anti-3C polyclonal antiserum when it was used in indirect immunofluorescence assays. As can be seen in Figs. 5A and 5B, staining of Vero cells expressing the T7 tagged 3C-like proteinase with anti-T7 antibody showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining profile. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of IBV-infected Vero cells with anti-3C antiserum showed a distinct perinuclear punctate pattern at 13 h postinfection (Fig. 5D ), although high background was also observed for the mock-infected cells (Fig. 5C ). This distribution pattern is similar to those reported for other coronaviruses and arteriviruses (Schiller et al., 1998; Shi et al., 1999; van der Meer et al., 1998) . These results suggest that the IBV 3C-like proteinase may exhibit differential subcellular distribution patterns in virus-infected cells and in transfected cells. When it was expressed individually, a diffuse distribution profile was observed. However, the proteinase was shown to be associated with intracellular membranous structures in virus-infected cells.",

Once again, the IBV membrane protein was detected only in the membrane fraction (Fig. 6b, lane 4) .",

In a separate report, the Q 3379 -A 3380 dipeptide bond, which is located 14 amino acids downstream of the Q 3365 -G 3366 dipeptide bond and is conserved in all four sequenced coronaviruses (Lu et al., 1998) , was also predicted to be a cleavage site of the 3C-like proteinase (Lee et al., 1991) . The equivalent Q-A dipeptide bond of human coronavirus was actually identified as a genuine cleavage site (Ziebuhr and Siddell, 1999) . In an in vitro study, Tibbles et al. (1999) recently reported that the Q 3365 -G 3366 dipeptide bond may be not used by the IBV 3C-like proteinase. However, the cleavability of the Q 3379 -A 3380 dipeptide bond was not mentioned in their report (Tibbles et al., 1999) . To further study whether either site is used by the IBV 3C-like proteinase, deletion and mutational analyses were carried out. As antiserum against this specific region was not available, the two downstream cleavage sites were disabled by site-directed mutagenesis, and anti-24 and antiserum V47 were used to immunoprecipitate the potential cleavage products (Ng and Liu, 1998) (Fig. 7a) . Expression of pIBV1a16 resulted in the detection of the 33-kDa protein and a . The viral products generated from cleavage by the 3C-like proteinase and the full-length products encoded by the two plasmids are illustrated. The molecular masses of these products were estimated according to their migration on SDS-PAGE. The Q 3086 residue is encoded by nucleotides 9784-9786.

As can be seen in Fig. 7b , expression of pIBV1a16\u232c1 resulted in the detection of both the 33-and the 46-kDa proteins and a product of approximately 52 kDa (lanes 5, 6, and 7).

Previous studies using an in vitro processing assay showed that this proteinase may be released from the 1a polyprotein by self-cleavage at two Q-S dipeptide bonds (Q 2779 -S 2780 and Q 3086 -S 3087 ), and the in vitro enzymatic activity is strictly dependent on the addition of microsomal membranes (Tibbles et al., 1996) . In this study, we show that the IBV 3C-like proteinase is active in vitro even in the absence of microsomal membranes and that addition of the membranes only marginally increases the cleavage efficiency. Time-course and pulse-chase experiments further showed that efficient autoprocessing of the 3C-like proteinase occurs when the IBV sequence from nucleotide 8693 to 9911 was expressed in vitro (Fig.  4b) . This is inconsistent with the results reported by Tibbles et al. (1996) , showing no autoprocessing of the 3C-like proteinase when the same region was expressed in vitro even in the presence of microsomal membranes (Tibbles et al., 1996) . The reason for this discrepancy is currently unclear. However, the in vitro enzymatic activities of the IBV 3C-like proteinase reported here resemble the equivalent proteinase of human and murine coronaviruses. For example, the 3C-like proteinases of both human and murine coronaviruses are active when expressed in vitro (Heusipp et al., 1997a; Lu et al., 1995; Schiller et al., 1998) , and autoprocessing of the MHV 3C-like proteinase was slightly increased by the addition of microsomal membranes when only the upstream hydrophobic region was presented (Pinon et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "The mutagenesis studies presented here support the conclusion that the Q 2779 -S 2780 and Q 3086 -S 3087 dipeptide bonds are the N-and C-terminal cleavage sites, respectively, of the 3C-like proteinase. Interestingly, substantial cleavage was observed after mutation of either site to E-S, suggesting that the P1 position at these two sites are more tolerant to mutagenesis. However, much less tolerance to alterations at the P1 position was observed for the rest of the 11 cleavage sites identified so far (Liu et al., 1997 Ng and Liu, 1998) . The reasons for this difference are uncertain, but it may reflect the differing cleavage efficacy between the cisand trans-enzymatic activities of the proteinase. The kinetic studies present here clearly indicate that cleavage first takes place at the Q 2779 -S 2780 dipeptide bond, which is followed by cleavage at the Q 3086 -S 30870 dipeptide bond, resulting in the release of the 3C-like proteinase. Cleavage at these two sites is therefore mediated by the cis activity of the proteinase. This process is very rapid and efficient, as no precursor containing the proteinase was detected even when the region was overexpressed in intact cells. Processing at other sites is thus likely mediated by the \"free\" 3C-like proteinase in trans. To argue against this speculation, Pinon et al. (1999) have recently reported that mutations of either the P1 or the P2 residue of the N-terminal QS site abolished in vitro autoprocessing of the MHV 3C-like proteinase.",

            "text": "Another interesting observation is that mutation of the Q 3086 residue to an E alters the mobility of the 33-kDa proteinase on SDS-PAGE, yet almost full enzymatic activity of the proteinase is maintained. Mutation of the equivalent Q 3267 residue of HCV-229E 3C-like proteinase to an A exerts no effect on the proteinase activity, although information on the mobility of this mutant on SDS-PAGE was not available . Deletion of up to 7 amino acids from the C-terminus of the IBV 3C-like proteinase renders no significant effect on the enzymatic activity of the proteinase. Progressive loss of the activity was observed when further deletions were made. Interestingly, significant enzymatic activity was still maintained when the C-terminal 67 amino acid residues were deleted. Furthermore, the three mutant forms (the Q 3086 -E mutant and the two mutants with deletions of 3 and 7 amino acids) migrate on SDS-PAGE significantly more slowly than the wild-type proteinase. These results suggest that the extreme C-terminal region may be able to fold into a unique structure independent of the catalytic domain, which is located at the N-terminal half of the protein. Cotranslational folding of a functionally active proteinase domain may occur even before the whole proteinase is synthesized. This argument would be supported by several recent studies on eukaryotic protein folding. It was demonstrated that rapid and efficient folding of modular model proteins depends on sequential folding of their domains during synthesis (Netzer and Hartl, 1997; Nicola et al., 1999; Louis et al., 1999) . Cotranslational folding of two proteinase domains with enzymatic activities was observed when the novel polypeptide chains were still bound to the ribosome (Nicola et al., 1999; Louis et al., 1999) . This is in contrast to the protein folding in prokaryotic system, in which the folding of a functional domain occurs posttranslationally (Netzer and Hartl, 1997) . This different folding mechanism may explain the data reported by Ziebuhr et al. (1997) , showing that the HCV-229E 3C-like proteinase expressed in bacteria was inactivated by deletion of the C-terminal 33 amino acid residues.",

(b) Mutation and deletion analyses of the Q 3379 -A 3380 dipeptide bond. Plasmids pIBV1a16\u232c1, pIBV1a16\u232c1Q 3379 -E, and pIBV1a16\u232c2 were expressed in Cos-7 cells using the vaccinia-T7 system. Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine-cysteine and total lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-24 and anti-3C, respectively. Polypeptides were separated on an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel and detected by fluorography. et al., 1999) . As rapid self-cleavage of the 3C-like proteinase from the polyprotein precursors was reported for these viruses, these staining patterns should be contributed mainly by the staining of the mature 3C-like proteinase. In this report, we present evidence showing that the IBV 3C-like protein displays a free distribution pattern when it was expressed in intact cells alone. However, in IBV-infected cells, the proteinase is associated mainly with the intracellular membranes. Two possibilities may be responsible for these different distribution patterns. First, the 3C-like proteinase may be sequestered to cellular membranous compartments by interacting with other viral or cellular proteins. Recently, we showed that anti-3C antiserum could immunoprecipitate a protein band of about 170 kDa in IBV-infected cells (Lim et al., 2000) . The same protein species could also be detected by several other IBV region-specific antisera (Lim et al., 2000) . As the 170-kDa protein may be an IBV-induced host protein, it is tempting to speculate that the IBV 3C like proteinase together with other viral products may interact with this protein to form a multiprotein complex involved in viral replication. The second possibility is that the IBV 3C-like proteinase may be able to bind to viral RNA. In poliovirus, the viral 3C proteinase was shown to be an RNA binding protein (Andino et al., 1993) . The 3C proteinase and polymerase precursor (3CD) together with a cellular protein can form a ribonucleoprotein complex with the first 90 nucleotides of the poliovirus genome (Andino et al., 1993) . This complex may play an important role in the replication of polioviral RNA. We are currently unclear whether the IBV 3C-like proteinase may be involved in the formation of coronavirus replication complexes.",
