They are widely used as models of human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), in which immune mechanisms are thought to participate in the development of lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). The effects of MHV infection on target cell functions in the CNS are not well understood, but A59 has been shown to induce the expression of MHC class I molecules in glial cells after in vivo and in vitro infection. Changes in class I expression in infected cells may contribute to the immunopathogenesis of MHV infection in the CNS. In this communication, a large panel of MHV strains was tested for their ability to stimulate class I expression in primary astrocytes in vitro. The data show that the more hepatotropic strains, such as MHV-A59, MHV-1, MHV-2, MHV-3, MHV-D, MHV-K, and MHV-NuU, were potent inducers of class I expression in astrocytes during acute infection, measured by radioimmunoassay. The K b molecule was preferentially expressed over D b. By contrast, JHMV and several viral strains derived from it did not stimulate the expression of class I molecules. Assays of virus infectivity indicated that the class I-inducing activity did not correlate with the ability of the individual viral strain to replicate in astrocytes. However, exposure of the viruses or the supernatants from infected astrocytes to ultraviolet light abolished the class I-inducing activity, indicating that infectious virus is required for class I expression. These data also suggest that class I expression was induced directly by virus infection, and not by the secretion of a soluble substance into the medium by infected astrocytes. Finally, analyses of A59/JHMV recombinant viral strains suggest that class I-inducing activity resides in one of the A59 structural genes.",

Although some MHV strains, such as A59 and MHV-3, can cause both gastrointestinal and neurological disease in mice and rats, many tend to induce pathology that is restricted to either system, prompting their classification as hepatotropic or neurotropic. There has been considerable interest in the study of the more neurotropic strains of MHV, such as JHMV and A59, because of their ability to produce demyelinating lesions that resemble the demyelinating plaques observed in the human neurological disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). In addition, MHV and human coronavirus iso- 1013 lates are capable of inducing demyelination in primates (8) , and coronavirus RNA and antigen have been detected in demyelinating lesions in the brains of MS patients (9, 10) .",

The structural proteins have been well characterized, and include the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which interacts with the viral RNA, and two envelope glycoproteins, the spike (S) and membrane (M) proteins. The S protein forms the virion surface spikes and is responsible for binding the cellular MHV receptor, inducing cell-to-cell fusion and providing a target for neutralizing antibodies. It is the least conserved of the structural proteins among the MHV strains (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . M interacts with the N protein-R.NA comply, and may be involved in virus assembly. It is the most conserved structural protein among the MHV. A third envelope glycoprotein, hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), has been identified in MHV-S and several JHMV isolates, and may participate in the pathogenesis of JHMV infection in the central nervous system (CNS) (11, 17) . Nonstructural proteins include an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and three additional proteins that do not appear to be required for viral replication, but whose functions and biological activities have not been identified.",

            "text": "After intracerebral (i.c.) inoculation in mice and rats, the parent strains of both JHMV and A59 cause an acute encephalomyelitis and demyelination from which a varying number of animals survive to exhibit chronic demyelination (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) 11) . The severity of the disease varies with the individual virus strain and with the age, genetic background, and immune status of the infected host. The neuropathological features of acute infection can be somewhat distinguished from those of chronic disease by a prevalence of gray matter involvement in which virus replicates in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes to cause extensive CNS damage (18) (19) (20) (21) . In chronic disease, lesions are more prevalent in the white matter and consist of primary demyelination with axonal sparing (2, 11) . Infectious virus is rarely isolated during chronic JHMV disease, though viral RNA can be detected by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in the brains of infected mice as late as 2 yr post infection (p.i., Fleming, J., personal communication). Viral antigen and RNA tend to be restricted to astrocytes in chronic infection (2, (22) (23) (24) (25) , though there is evidence that neurons are also affected (25) . This pattern of white matter involvement is also characteristic of infection with attenuated or mutant strains of A59 (26, 27) or JHMV (25, (27) (28) (29) , which cause demyelination in the relative absence of encephalitis. In vitro, JHMV and A59 cause a lytic infection in primary oligodendrocyte cultures that is rapidly selflimiting, but both virus strains can establish a productive and relatively nonlytic, acute, and long-term chronic infection in mixed glial cell cultures and in cultures enriched for astrocytes (30) (31) (32) . These data support early reports that acute demyelination is the result of virus-mediated oligodendrocyte death (2, 11) , but more importantly, they also suggest that the astrocyte plays an important role in acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination.",

            "text": "Currently, there is very little known about the ability of MHV strains to influence specific activities of the host cells that they infect. Early reports indicate that A59 infection enhances the expression of MHC class I molecules in primary cultures of murine glial cells (33) and that the enhancement also occurs in the brain after i.c. infection in C57B1/6 mice (34). Since class I molecules play a key role in the interaction between infected target cells and CD8 + cytotoxic T cells (CTL; 35, 36) , any change in their expression after virus infection has potential implications for the outcome of the infection. Cells in the CNS generally express little, if any, constitutive class I antigen in vivo, but astrocytes have been consistently reported to express both class I and class II antigens in vitro after the addition of IFN-3' and/or TNF-ot to the culture medium (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) . Several reports indicate that astrocytes are capable of acting as antigen-presenting cells for in vitro antigen-or a11ospecific CD4 \u00a7 and CD8 \u00a7 T cell responses (43, 44) , which suggests that they also have potential to participate in immune responses occurring within the confines of the CNS. Since clearance of infectious JHMV from the CNS requires class I-restricted CD8 + T cells (11, (45) (46) (47) , it is of particular interest to characterize the effect of MHV infection on class I expression in one of its principal cellular targets.",

Thus, it was important to determine whether the lack of class I inducing activity by JHMV was due to poor replication efficiency in primary astrocytes. For this purpose, the number of astrocytes staining for viral antigen was determined by immunoperoxidase staining, and the yield of infectious viral particles/cell was measured in infectious center assays. The data, presented in Table 3 , indicate that on day 3 p.i., 53% of the JHM-DL-infected astrocytes were positive for viral antigen, compared with 45% of cells infected with A59. In addition, cells infected with the recombinant virus CA13, which retains 3' JHMV and 5' A59 sequences and does not stimulate class I expression, showed 48% antigen positive staining. Cells infected with CA13 produced the highest level of infectious virus at 0.51 plaques/cell, in spite of its inability to stimulate class I expression (Table 3) .

Similarly, our data show that UV-inactivated A59 and A59like recombinant coronavirus strains are not able to induce class I activity in purified astrocytes (Table 4 ). Virus inactivation in the UV-treated virus preparations was confirmed by plaque assay using DBT cells (data not shown). However, class I-inducing activity was not detected in the supernatants collected on days 3 and 7 p.i. from A59-infected astrocytes and exposed to UV light to inactivate the virus (Fig. 5) , while supernatants that were not exposed to UV light and thus, contained infectious virus, were able to induce class I.

Finally, there was no evidence of the presence of TNF-ot in UV-treated supernatants of A59-infected astrocytes (data not shown).

However, class I-inducing in JHMV was also not due to poor replication efficiency in astrocytes, since JHMV infected the same percentage of cells and produced similar levels of infectious virus as the class I-inducing MHV strains (Table 3) . Thus, some other MHV characteristic must be responsible for class I-inducing activity, or the lack thereof. Since the expression of class I genes is regulated by interferons (55) , it seemed possible that class I induction might correlate with the ability of MHV strains to stimulate IFN production. This possibility gains credibility from reports that JHMV is a notoriously poor inducer of interferon after in vitro (56) and in vivo (57) infection. However, Suzumura et al. (53) did not detect IFNs in UV-treated supernatants from A59-infected mixed glial cells in spite of the presence of class I-inducing activity, and our findings indicate that A59-induced class I expression was not inhibited by antibodies to IFN-a/3 or -3' (Table 4 ). Unlike Suzumura et al. (53), we did not find that class I-inducing activity was retained after UV-inactivation of A59 or the A59-1ike recombinant MHV strains (Table 4) , and it was not detected in supernarants from A59-infected astrocytes that were UV-treated to inactivate infectious virus (Table 5 and Fig. 5 ). In addition, we have recently found that class I expression is no longer observed when A59 replication is controlled by the culture of persistently infected astrocytes in the presence of MHVspecific polyclonal antiserum, in spite of the persistence of viral protein and RNA (58) . Overall, our data suggest that class I induction by MHV in astrocytes requires infectious virus and does not involve the secretion of a soluble factor. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the class I-inducing activity originally reported by Suzumura et al. (33, 53) was also dependent on continuous virus production in glial cell cultures prepared from the brains of infected mice (54) . However, it is possible that our lack of detection of class I-inducing activity in the supernatants could reflect culture, or other technical conditions. Although it was not possible to attribute class I-inducing activity to a single gene or gene product using the A59/JHMV recombinant virus strains, the data clearly indicate that class I-inducing activity maps to the 3' end of the A59 genome, which contains the genes encoding the primary structural proteins S, M, and N, and two poorly understood nonstructural proteins. However, there are some indications that S is the most likely candidate. For example, recombinant strains which retain more A59 sequences in the S gene tended to be more potent than those retaining less A59, or moreJHMV character. In addition, the S gene shows the greatest antigenic divergence of the structural proteins between A59 and JHMV (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) and so might be more likely to exhibit differences in activity. This possibility is supported by data indicating that A59 andJHMV differ considerably in their ability to cause receptor-independent fusion and syncytium formation (59) . In addition, preliminary data suggest that A59 and JHMV may show selective binding to the cellular receptors for MHV (60) , which are members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family of proteins (61) .",

Differential modulation of H-2K and H-2D molecules has been reported to follow in vitro JHMV infection in mouse brain endothelial cells, and the data indicate that the nature of the regulation was dependent on the mouse strain and did not necessarily correlate with susceptibility to JHMV-induced CNS disease (64) . Thus, K was decreased and D increased in endothelial cells from susceptible BALB/c mice, but both were upregulated in susceptible B10.S and (BALB/c x SJL)F1 and resistant SJL endothelial cells. Differential expression of K and D molecules has not always been observed after virus infection of neural cells; both K and D molecules appear to be equally enhanced by West Nile virus infection in astrocytes from CBA/H mice (65) , and the murine neuroblastoma C1300 does not show differential K and D expression when persistently infected with measles virus (66) . However, the possibility that differential modulation of class I molecules may be linked to CNS disease, or may be a marker of susceptibility to virus-induced CNS disease, is suggested by studies using Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV; 67, 68). After i.c. TMEV inoculation, resistant B10 mice showed minimal class I expression in the CNS that did not differ between K and D, whereas susceptible B10.Q and B10.RBQ mice showed a greater increase in D expression compared with that of K (67) .",

In these experiments, JHMV infection at an m.o.i, of 0.1 was followed by a two-to threefold increase in the expression of H-2K molecules, measured by FACS | analyses, but astrocytes from C57BL/6 mice were not tested. The disparity in our findings may again reflect differences in the regulation of class I expression that are mouse strain specific. However, it is also possible that the disparity may be due to the cellular composition of the astrocyte cultures used for infection. In their report, Joseph et al. (69) , did not indicate whether or not they purified the astrocytes from mixed glial cell cultures. In our hands, mixed glial cells that have not been subjected to mechanical shaking for purification of astrocytes show up to 30% contamination by microglia, or cells staining for macrophage/monocyte surface antigens (data not shown). Microglial cells readily express class I molecules both in vivo and in vitro (70) (71) (72) , and so might be expected to express class I after JHMV infection. The cultures used in our experiments routinely show 95% or greater purity, containing 2-4% microglial cells, and \"~50% express class I after A59 infection. Thus, class I expression in these cultures occurs primarily in astrocytes, with little, if any contribution by microglia. Finally, it should also be mentioned that class I expression in astrocytes, like that in endothelial cells, does not appear to be linked to susceptibility to JHMV-induced CNS disease, since both BALB/c and C57BL/6 develop encephalitis and demyelination in spite of their differences in class I inducibility after JHMV infection. In addition, astrocytes from SJL mice express class I after JHMV infection in spite of being resistant to CNS disease.",

            "text": "The different effect of A59 and JHMV on class I expression in astrocytes suggests that class I may play different roles in their pathogenesis. As discussed by Maudsley et al. (73) , the classical picture of MHC expression after virus infection is that of an increase that is most likely mediated by the release of IFNs by infiltrating immune cells, and is thought to facilitate the ability of T cells to recognize the infected cells and control or eliminate the infection. Unfortunately, clearance of virus from infected tissue by CTLs is often accompanied by significant cellular destruction, which is not well tolerated in tissues with limited regenerative capacity, especially the CNS. Thus, the ability of a virus to stimulate class I expression in host cells may facilitate a rapid CTL response that in turn accelerates tissue destruction originally begun by virus-mediated cell lysis (74) . This may be the case for A59 infection, since the A59 strains used in these experiments cause a severe encephalitis after i.c. inoculation that begins on day 4 p.i., and results in death of the majority of infected mice by day 6-7 p.i. (our unpublished data). However, it is not known if the infiltration of T cells into the CNS after i.c. A59 infection is associated with the onset of encephalitis. By contrast, JHMV causes a similar clinical dis-ease, but the onset of encephalitis is delayed in comparison with that of A59, beginning on day 6-7 p.i. (21) . Death occurs on day 9-11 at a similar incidence. The onset of encephalitis coincides with the appearance of immune cells in the CNS, which, after JHM-DS infection, peaks on days 7-9 p.i. (75) . It is possible that class I expression is upregulated at this time by the secretion of interferon by the infiltrating immune cells, facilitating JHMV-specific, CTL-mediated tissue destruction. Thus, the difference in the ability of JHMV and A59 to stimulate class I expression in astrocytes may contribute to the speed of disease progression in the CNS. It is interesting to note that Fazakerley et al. (25) reported that the JHMV variant, V5A13.1, is neuroattenuated relative to parental JHMV by its slower rate of spread in the CNS of BALB/c mice. Variant V5A13.1 differs from parental JHMV by the deletion of 142 amino acids in one of the subunits of the S protein (16, 76) , suggesting that S plays an important role in the rate of virus spread in the CNS. In this respect, it would be of interest to test the ability of neuroattenuated A59 strains to stimulate class I expression in astrocytes.",
