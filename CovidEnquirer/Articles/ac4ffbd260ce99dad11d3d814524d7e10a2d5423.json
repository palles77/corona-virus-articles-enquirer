The virus multiplied in bovine embryonic kidney cell cultures, but failed to induce readily recognizable cytopathic effect . Recently we have obserced that the virus readily replicates and induces a marked I cytopathic effect in cultures of a continuous cell line, BEK-1, derived frovll bovine embryonic kidney. This observation has provided a sensitive, practical assay method (Inaba et al., 1976) , whereby the virus and its disease can now be studied more systematically.
