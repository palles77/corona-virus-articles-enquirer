This paper focuses on a risk decisionmaking problem in emergency response with several distinct characteristics including dynamic evolvement process of emergency, multiple scenarios, and impact of response actions on the emergency scenarios. A method based on Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is proposed to solve the problem. By analyzing the evolvement process of emergency, the Fault Tree (FT) is constructed to describe the logical relations among conditions and factors resulting in the evolvement of emergency. Given different feasible response actions, the probabilities of emergency scenarios are estimated by FTA. Furthermore, the overall ranking value of each action is calculated, and a ranking of feasible response actions is determined. Finally, a case study on H1N1 infectious diseases is given to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.",

For example, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) broken out in east Asia early 2003 resulted in the death of hundreds of people, the global panic and the inestimable economic loss. When an emergency occurs, the relevant management personnel or decision-makers (DMs) need to decide what actions to take instantly so as to mitigate or minimize the negative effects. Usually, the decision-making problems in emergency response are complicated due to the limited decision data and possible evolvement of emergency scenarios [1, 2] . Therefore, how to select an effective response action in the earlier stage of emergency is an important research topic of emergency management.",

In existing studies, various decision-making methods are proposed according to the characteristics of different actual emergency events, such as nuclear accident [1, 7] , flood disaster [2, 4, 6, 8] and so on. In some actual emergency situations, like infectious diseases and fire hazards etc., the decision-making problems have dynamic and risky characteristics. This needs to consider a special risk decision-making problem with several distinct characteristics including dynamic evolvement process of emergency, multiple scenarios, and impact of response actions on the emergency scenarios. However, the existing decision analysis methods seldom consider to solve the decision-making problems with the above characteristics. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the risk decision-making problem considering the characteristics of dynamic evolvement and multiple scenarios in emergency response.",

In this paper, we incorporate FTA into the analysis of risk decision-making problem with the characteristics of dynamic evolvement and multiple scenarios in emergency response. An emergency with multiple scenarios is regarded as a 'system', the undesirable scenarios of the emergency are regarded as 'system hazardous events', and the conditions and factors resulting in the evolvement of emergency are denoted as middle events and basic events. Accordingly, a fault tree (FT) for the emergency is constructed to describe the logical relations among scenarios, conditions and factors. Based on the constructed FT, the probabilities of emergency scenarios can be estimated with respect to each feasible response action. Furthermore, based on obtained probabilities of emergency scenarios, classical risk decision-making method can be employed to calculate the overall ranking value of each action.",

In early 2003, more infected cases were successively found in different provinces in China, including, 6 cases in Guangxi province on January 4, 3 cases in Sichuan province on February 10, and 1 case in Hunan province on February 14, etc. SARS continuously spread to other countries and regions by traveling passengers. On February 15, 2003, a doctor from Guangdong province, who had been infected by SARS, arrived at Hongkong, and infected 15 hotel visitors. The infected visitors then traveled to Canada, Singapore, Taiwan and Vietnam, and caused further widely spreading of SARS.

In this situation, the indirect elicitation technique [26, 27] , Delphi method [28] or Nominal Group Technique [29] can be used to determine the probabilities of basic events. In the indirect elicitation technique, a series of data on historical similar events are provided to the experts. Then, the experts are asked to compare the probabilities of basic events with those of historical similar events, which will be helpful to determine the experts' personal judgment on the probabilities of basic events. Further, based on the experts' personal judgment, Delphi method [28] and Nominal Group Technique [29] are employed to determine a consistency collective judgment on the probabilities of basic events.

It can be seen from Fig. 3 , Tables 2 and 3 that X 2 and X 3 belong to the first type of basic events. If the first infected person has not been detected timely, then the probabilities of X 2 and X 3 would be greater. Conversely, probabilities of X 2 and X 3 would be smaller. In addition, it can be seen from the practical meanings of X 2 and X 3 that there is inter-dependence between the probabilities of X 2 and X 3 . In other words, if the probability of X 2 is greater, then the probability of X 3 is also greater. Consider the probabilities of X 2 and X 3 are changed to r 0 i2 and r 0 i3 , respectively.",

Furthermore, according to the obtained probabilities, the ranking of actions is determined by calculating the overall ranking values of feasible actions. The major contributions of this paper are discussed as follows.",
