This assay measures the initial enzyme activity rate during the first minute of the reaction, which ensures linear velocity relative to time and a progress curve slope proportional to analyte concentration. During this period, the enzyme substrate is in large excess relative to the analyte/antibody-enzyme complex, and enzyme catalysis proceeds in steady-state conditions. Analyses of repeatability gave coefficients of variation between 4.4 and 9.7 (interassay) and 4.4 and 6.4 (intra-assay), and analyte detectability ranged from 5.8 to 12 ng/ ml. The Z-factor calculated for analyte samples at their end dilution yielded mean values from 0.57 to 0.87, which confirmed assay robustness. This initial velocity-based sandwich ELISA is a simple, sensitive, reproducible method to quantitate bi-epitopic antigens.",

            "text": "Enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA, EIA) are antibody-based analyses used to measure antigen-antibody interactions by an enzyme reaction. ELISA is a simple, flexible, low-cost technology that can be developed in a variety of innovative formats to implement sensitive, specific analytical tools for biomedical, environmental, and basic scientific research (Law et al., 2015; Peruski and Peruski Jr, 2003; Zheng et al., 2006) . Enzyme immunoassays are amenable to different formats based on the type of analyte studied (antigen or antibody), detection technique (competitive vs noncompetitive), or the separation method for bound and free reactants (homo-or heterogeneous) (Butler, 1994; Crowther, 2009) . Heterogeneous non-competitive sandwich ELISA is performed in 96-well microtiter plates with anti-analyte-specific antibodies attached to the surface. Solid phase-bound antibodies are subsequently exposed to the analyte-containing sample and, after separation of free and bound reactants, the analyte-captured fraction is quantitated with a second antigen-specific antibody conjugated to a reporter enzyme. After a usually lengthy incubation period, product formation is measured by a single readout, from which the sample titer is derived. The main drawback of this method is that a single measurement of product formation does not ensure that it was obtained within the linear range of the progress curve, which is the condition that guarantees proportionality between enzyme reaction rate and analyte bound fraction, and ensures that enzyme substrate has not been depleted.",

In these assays, the reaction product is determined by a single readout taken after extended incubation, which raises doubts as to the quantitative accuracy of such assays. It has since become customary to follow signal development until sufficient color is observed, usually after a recommended 10-min incubation (Crowther, 2009 ). This potentially inexact practice has not changed with the now-generalized use of mouse IgG ELISA kits; our survey of the suggested procedure for six commonly used commercial mouse IgG kits showed that a single measurement after 10 to 30 min enzyme development is the usual protocol. Most of these kits also leave construction of the calibration curve to the user; if not managed carefully, this can introduce additional uncertainty as to accuracy.",
