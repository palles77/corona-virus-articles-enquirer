            "text": "A bacterial target-specific titanium oxide (TiO 2 ) photocatalyst was developed for the enhancement of selective inactivation of targeted bacteria. An antibacterial composition comprising TiO 2 particles immobilized with a bacterial-specific antibody having affinity to bacteria of interest was prepared via a carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (EDC/NHS) coupling reaction between polyacrylic acid (PAA) coated TiO 2 and an antibody. As a model case, an antibody to Escherichia coli was conjugated with the PAA-coated TiO 2 (TiO 2 -Ab E ). We evaluated the enhancement of the antibacterial effect of TiO 2 -Ab E against target E. coli, compared with its effect on other bacteria that lack affinity for the antibody used. The TiO 2 -Ab E inactivated approximately 90% of the E. coli at 15 min, whereas the raw TiO 2 inactivated approximately 20% of the E. coli after the same period of time under UV irradiation. The TiO 2 -Ab E did not show an enhanced antibacterial effect against non-target bacteria. We infer that close contact between TiO 2 particles and E. coli, as a result of the specificity of the antibody, can enhance the direct transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by TiO 2 particles to the cellular surface under UV irradiation and result in rapid and efficient inactivation of the targeted bacteria. The strategy presented here will facilitate the combination of other receptors and TiO 2 particles for the preparation of highly selective and photocatalytic composites to prevent or remediate contamination by unwanted bacteria in a wide variety of natural and man-made systems.",

Infection by microorganisms can result in serious problems such as food poisoning, enteritis, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [1] [2] [3] . Numerous antimicrobial methods, such as filtration [4, 5] , thermal treatment [6, 7] , antibiotic agents [8, 9] , disinfectants [10] , and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation [11, 12] , have been studied and evaluated for their effectiveness against different microorganisms under varying environmental conditions. Interestingly, however, these studies have been mostly dedicated to the non-selective inactivation of microorganisms. Most methods for microorganism sterilization are non-specific, and therefore, useful microorganisms are killed alongside target microorganisms.",

During the antibacterial activity test, 100 l of the bacterial samples were removed at each time point, diluted with autoclaved water, coated on a nutrient agar plate and incubated for 17 h at 37 \u2022 C to count CFUs. First, we tested the antibacterial activity of the TiO 2 and TiO 2 -Ab E particles. E. coli suspension (5 ml, 1 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/ml) was prepared in glass vials and mixed with 0.5 mg of raw TiO 2 or TiO 2 -Ab E particles. Before UV irradiation cell suspensions were incubated for 15 min in a shaking incubator (250 rpm) in order to allow the TiO 2 or TiO 2 -Ab E particles to bind with the E. coli before the UV lamp was turned on. A UV lamp (15 W, with a spectral maximum at 365 nm; Vilber Lourmat; France) was used to irradiate the cell suspensions in a shaking incubator (250 rpm) at room temperature. The distance between the UV lamp and the glass vials was 10 cm and the UV intensity was 0.7 W/cm 2 . During the UV irradiation 100 l of cell suspension was sampled to measure CFUs at each time point (0, 15, 45, 75, 115, and 135 min). To test for possible photodegradation and loss of photokilling activity of the TiO 2 -Ab E , particles were exposed under UV irradiation (15 W UV lamp, 365 nm, 0.7 W/cm 2 ) for 0 min, 30 min, 60 min or 120 min prior to use for photokilling experiment. Then, the photokilling activity of each particle type was tested against E. coli. UV irradiation was performed as previously described. CFUs were measured after 10 min of UV irradiation. The effect of varying concentration of TiO 2 or TiO 2 -Ab E was also investigated. The E. coli suspension (2 ml, 1 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/ml) was transferred to glass vials and TiO 2 or TiO 2 -Ab E particles were added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 0.01-0.5 mg/ml.

Colony morphology differed so markedly between E. coli and S. epidermidis that their cell survival percentages could be easily measured using a colony counting method on nutrient agar plates. Before UV irradiation of the mixture, 15 min incubation was allowed for binding of TiO 2 -Ab E to its target bacteria. The cell survival percentage of each bacterial species was checked after 5 min of UV irradiation. Culture suspensions of E. coli (10 ml, 1 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/ml) and S. epidermidis (10 ml, 1 \u00d7 10 8 CFU/ml) were mixed in a quartz vial, and TiO 2 or TiO 2 -Ab E particles (final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in mixture) were added. UV irradiation was administered in a black box reactor and CFUs were measured after 5 min. All experiments were repeated at least three times and average values with error bars are presented. Fig. 1 shows the steps required for preparation of the TiO 2 -Ab E particles. First, we modified the TiO 2 with a thin layer of PAA to address a carboxyl group, which can involve the conjugation of antibody with TiO 2 particles via EDC/NHS coupling reaction, and to prevent aggregation of TiO 2 in aqueous solution [30, 31] . To confirm the coating of TiO 2 with PAA, raw TiO 2 and PAA-coated TiO 2 were suspended in deionized water. Raw TiO 2 particles were precipitated after a few minutes, whereas PAA-coated TiO 2 particles remained homogeneously suspended in water for several hours. These results indicate that the ionized carboxylic groups on the PAA-coated TiO 2 altered the surface characteristics of raw TiO 2 from hydrophobic to hydrophilic. Furthermore, FT-IR data confirmed the generation of carboxyl groups on the PAA-coated TiO 2 particles and the generation of an amide bond from the antibody attached to TiO 2 -PAA (Fig. S1) .",

The TiO 2 -Ab E particles killed approximately 90% of E. coli at 15 min, whereas the raw TiO 2 particles killed 20% of the bacteria after the same period of time. To achieve a similar degree of cell inactivation (\u223c95%), the TiO 2 -Ab E solution required 45 min, whereas the raw TiO 2 solution required 75 min, and the UV irradiationonly sample (no TiO 2 ) required 135 min. Thus, TiO 2 -Ab E has more rapid and more reliable antibacterial properties than raw TiO 2 particles or only UV irradiation alone. The antibacterial activity of target-specific TiO 2 -Ab E to E. coli was substantially enhanced compared to TiO 2 synthesized using the vapor condensation method or vanadium pentoxide-loaded TiO 2 , which were synthesized for the enhanced catalytic activity of P25-TiO 2 and did not have bacterial target specificity [32, 33] .",

TiO 2 photocatalysis inactivates microorganisms mainly by production of ROS and photons [19, 34] . ROS usually damage external structures of microorganisms such as cellular outer membranes [35] .

Considering the possible reduction in the photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 -PAA or TiO 2 -Ab E compared to raw TiO 2 particles indicated by the MB degradation experiment, the superior antibacterial performance of TiO 2 -Ab E can be explained by the close contact of the TiO 2 particles with the surface of target bacteria, in spite of the poor photodegradative performance of TiO 2 -PAA (Fig. S2) .",

The enhancement in TiO 2 -Ab E 's photokilling activity decreased as UV exposure prior to use increased. The TiO 2 -Ab E particles exposed to UV for 120 min showed a 15% decrease in activity compared to non-exposed particles (Fig. S4 ). This may be due to loss of function of the antibody on the TiO 2 surface. Nevertheless, the functional activity and specificity to E. coli of TiO 2 -Ab E were not seriously diminished after even 120 min of UV exposure, and remained superior to raw TiO 2 .",

As shown in Fig. 5 , no obvious changes were observed in cell survival percentages of S. epidermidis, K. pneumoniae, or E. aerogenes when raw TiO 2 or TiO 2 -Ab E was mixed with each culture under UV irradiation. Only E. coli showed a difference in cell survival percentage, and TiO 2 -Ab E killed E. coli more rapidly than raw TiO 2 particles. We compared the cell survival ratio of each species of bacteria after 5 min UV irradiation, including two additional bacteria, C. freundii and B. subtilis, with TiO 2 or TiO 2 -Ab E . Only E. coli showed a relatively decreased cell survival percentage in the presence of TiO 2 -Ab E compared to raw TiO 2 particles (approximately 30% difference) after 5 min of UV treatment, while the other five species of bacteria showed no significant difference in cell survival percentage (Fig. S5) .",

As shown in Fig. 6 , addition of TiO 2 -Ab E resulted in a 55% reduction in the cell survival percentage of E. coli whereas addition of raw TiO 2 resulted in a 30% reduction. The cell survival ratio of S. epidermidis did not show any difference after 5 min of UV irradiation with either raw TiO 2 or TiO 2 -Ab E . The enhanced inactivation of target bacteria in a mixed population implied that TiO 2 -Ab E binds specifically to its target, E. coli, in a mixed bacterial population, with little non-specific binding to non-target bacteria. Thus, accumulation of TiO 2 particles around the target cell surface enhanced the inactivation of target bacterial cells in a mixed population.",

In the presence of UV, TiO 2 -Ab E enhanced the photokilling of E. coli specifically and had no significant photokilling effect on non-target. We suspected that the close contact of TiO 2 particles with bacterial cells, due to the high binding affinity of the conjugated receptors to their targets, may enhance ROS transfer to the bacterial surface, resulting in the enhancement of photokilling activity, although the oxidation ability of PAA-coated TiO 2 was weaker than that of raw TiO 2 . TiO 2 -Ab E also inactivated E. coli more efficiently than nontarget bacteria in a mixed population. The strategy presented in this study will facilitate the combination of other receptors with TiO 2 particles for preparation of highly selective and photocatalytic composites or antibacterial coating materials to remediate a wide variety of natural and man-made systems from contamination by unwanted organisms.",
