            "text": "Viruses account for a substantial number of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), ranging from 2% to 35%. 6 Influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus are the most common causes of viral pneumonia, followed by adenovirus, PIV types 1, 2, and 3, and influenza B. 6, 7 In addition, human metapneumovirus, three new human coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, coronavirus HKU1, and coronavirus NL96), and the H5N1 strain of the influenza virus can cause pneumonia. 6, 7 Viral pneumonia in adults may be classified into two clinical groups: so-called atypical pneumonia in otherwise healthy hosts, and viral pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. PIV infection is the one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 8, 9 although PIV pneumonia is very rare in healthy adults. Early, accurate diagnosis of pulmonary complications following HSCT is important because of its high mortality and morbidity. High-resolution CT is important for early diagnosis of pulmonary disease following HSCT. 5 Several CT findings of PIV pneumonia have been described in patients following HSCT. Patricia et al. reported the CT findings in 6 HSCT patients with PIV pneumonia who had multiple small nodules without cavitation with a peribronchial distribution. 8 There are no previous reports, however, of CT findings of PIV pneumonia in non-immunocompromised host. This is the first report of CT findings of parainfluenza pneumonia in a non-immunocompromised hosts.",
