However, there are other crucial reasons to limit the transmission of pathogens: bacteria are sometimes able to swap genetic information with each other, across species. Many genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance are contained within mobile elements such as plasmids and integrons. When infected patients are cared for in clinics or hospitals, these genes may be transferred efficiently if hygiene protocols are breached. Even more alarming is the frequency with which this may happen in the built environment when sanitation practices are insufficient, and human effluent mixes together and then enters the water supply without proper treatment. Fortunately, simple interventions, such as hand hygiene by healthcare workers and the installation and use of proper pit latrines or flush toilets in austere settings, can have a huge impact.",

Minimize the risk of passing resistance genes to bystander bacteria by keeping drug-resistant pathogens away from other patients-and yourselves. Clean hands before and after every encounter, obey other special precaution protocols, and maintain a clean examination area or hospital room. \u2022 Establish a Firm Diagnosis. Is the patient truly infected with a bacterial pathogen? Some diseases mimic infection but do not respond to antibiotics. If bacterial infection is present, culture data are extraordinarily helpful, because they will reveal not only the pathogen but also its susceptibility profile. Ideally, cultures should be obtained before antimicrobials are started. But for patients who have a severe infection, delays in starting treatment may have grave consequences; start antibiotics immediately and send specimens for culture as soon as possible. \u2022 Say NO to Antibiotics for Viral Rhinosinusitis.

Encourage patients to \"get smart\" about antibiotics, treat their symptoms, and emphasize the importance of maintaining the effectiveness of these medications if they should eventually require them. \u2022 Deescalate When Possible. If broad-spectrum empiric treatment was initiated for severe infection, be willing to trust the results of positive cultures and focus treatment. More expensive, newer drugs may not be superior to tried and true therapies. \u2022 Shorter May Be Better. Using the briefest duration of therapy possible may reduce selective pressure on bystander, normal flora. Subtherapeutic doses or intermittent, haphazard dosing are enormous mistakes, but treating at a full dose for a short period may have benefits for resistance-so long as the underlying infection has been adequately treated. \u2022 Collaborate with Experts. Specialists in the field of infectious diseases medicine are always eager to collaborate with other physicians, both to generate protocols and to care for specific patients. Consult these specialists when patients are severely ill, when they fail to improve as expected, when the resistance profile is unexpectedly severe, or when treatment involves multiple or toxic drugs. or exceed the savings envisioned.

Recent meta-analyses suggest a trend toward benefit in the treatment arms, but rarely a large enough benefit to achieve statistical significance. Given the complexity of our gastrointestinal microbiomes, it is small wonder that taking megadoses of one or a few microbes fails to reliably set things to right, including prevention of traveler's diarrhea. Further complicating the issue is a lack of ingredient standardization or regulatory oversight by the FDA for these products, which are classified as dietary supplements rather than medications. On the other hand, probiotics are unlikely to harm the patient-unless he or she has a suppressed immune system, in which case the probiotic microbes can become invasive, leading to colitis or bloodstream infection.

Conceptually, when a germ comes into contact with a human being, one of four things happens: the two simply ignore each other; the germ kills the host; the host kills the germ; or an agreement is reached-a state referred to as \"colonization.\" In colonization, bacteria inhabit an ecological niche within the patient, such as body hair follicles, the anterior nares, the oropharynx, the lower gastrointestinal tract, or the genitourinary tract. By definition, colonizers are clinically silent and cause no signs or symptoms of disease. However, colonizers can become pathogens in a moment, if given the opportunity by the host. This could happen with waning humoral immunity (as during chemotherapy), impaired cellular immunity (as in untreated human immunodeficiency [HIV] infection), anatomical injury (as in surgical wound infections), or alteration of the competitors within an ecological niche (as in antibiotic-associated diarrhea). Surveillance data are lacking, but clinical experience suggests that many patients who acquire MRDOs while overseas have asymptomatic colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. By itself, this is harmless; however, if these germs are allowed to flourish under the selective pressure of antibiotics, or if they migrate to other anatomic sites, then infection may develop. MDRO colonization may last for days, years, or anything in between. Patients who have traveled overseas for any considerable period of time, especially those who received health care during the trip, are at elevated risk for gastrointestinal MDRO colonization for at least the first 6 months after return. However, this is an arbitrary number, and there are many cases in which patients have demonstrated sustained colonization years after their exposure. This may have implications for infection control in the hospital or clinic. Currently there is no national consensus on whether to look for asymptomatic MDRO colonization, for example, via a rectal swab or fecal culture, in part because of the challenges this poses in the laboratory, and because it is not entirely clear what to do with that information. It may be simpler to assume these patients are colonized, and thus to treat them using contact precautions (diligent hand hygiene, gowns, and gloves). However, it is reasonable to consider surveillance cultures as part of a comprehensive infection control strategy if your clinic or center encounters these organisms frequently.",

As described in Chapters 21 and 30, enteric fever due to Salmonella enterica serovars typhi and paratyphi are leading causes of fever among travelers returning from the tropics. In the past, fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were reliable treatment options for these infections; currently, the majority of isolates acquired in Southeast Asia, in particular South Asia, are partially or fully resistant to fluoroquinolones. Third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone are more reliable empiric choices and can be used in uncomplicated disease, but unfortunately resistance to this class is also on the rise. Someone who is septic with suspected salmonella infection acquired in India should be admitted and treated empirically with a carbapenem such as ertapenem, until antibiotic susceptibility testing confirms a narrower-spectrum agent can be used. Similarly, enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), which was once predictably susceptible to fluoroquinolones, is increasingly resistant-again particularly in Southeast Asia-and alternative drugs such as azithromycin are more reliable today. Other MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant species, may require toxic agents such as aminoglycosides for treatment. Fortunately, symptomatic infection of the gut is uncommonly caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, presumably because these bacteria infrequently carry extra virulence genes. Drug resistance and increased virulence are not necessarily found together.",

            "text": "\u2022 Urinary tract infection (UTI). MDR Gram-negative rods, especially from the Enterobacteriaceae group, which includes E. coli, may be detected in the urine of returning travelers, particularly women. Presumably, this is because gastrointestinal colonization is a common source of MDROs in travelers (see above), and proximity of the urethral meatus to the anal aperture facilitates bacterial entrance into the urinary tract (just as happens with all UTIs). Because treatment can be challenging, it is essential to distinguish between true UTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU). If a patient does not have signs or symptoms of UTI such as urinary urgency or frequency, hematuria, pyuria, suprapubic tenderness, or an abnormal urinalysis, or if her urine was tested for reasons that are unclear, then by definition she has ABU, which should not be treated with antibiotics. On the other hand, if clinical suspicion for true UTI is high, then treatment is appropriate. Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America suggest that uncomplicated UTI be treated empirically, without sending a urine culture unless symptoms persist or recur. However, patients who have recently been overseas may not fit into this category of \"uncomplicated,\" and our practice is to send a clean-catch midstream urine specimen for urinanalysis and reflexively for culture if the urinanalysis is abnormal at the first presentation for these patients. Culture data will take time, however, so an empiric prescription will be necessary. Ideally, these patients should receive one dose of fosfomycin 3 gm PO, because resistance to this drug is less common than to the alternative first-line treatments (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 1 dose PO BID for 3 days or nitrofurantoin 100 mg PO BID for 5 days). Alternative oral treatments are even less likely to succeed against MDR Enterobacteriaceae, such as ciprofloxacin or cefpodoxime. After culture and resistance data are available, empiric treatment can be changed if the patient has failed to improve. In many cases, no oral treatment will have a favorable in vitro resistance profile. This is an appropriate situation in which to consult a specialist in infectious diseases, who may have access to experimental oral treatments or who can assist with parenteral treatment if indicated. In many cases, an intravenous course of a carbapenem, such as ertapenem 1 gm IV daily for 5 days, may be required. Some patients will develop recurrent UTI symptoms, which can be stubborn and frustrating for everyone. An emerging strategy that may hold promise involves resetting the microbiome of the vagina. E. coli does not belong in the vagina in substantial amounts, and most UTIs in otherwise healthy women are caused by E. coli ascending the urethra from the introitus. A leading hypothesis is that the vagina is usually protected from high-level E. coli colonization because of its low pH, which is provided by the activity of human lactobacilli, including Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners, among other species. These healthy bacteria may be wiped out inadvertently by antibiotic courses given for other reasons, such as rhinosinusitis. Sadly, most commercially available lactobacillus supplements contain bovine species such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus, which do not lower vaginal pH appropriately. Fortunately, clinical trials of human lactobacilli in vaginal suppositories have shown a protective effect, and there is hope that FDA registry trials will result in approval of this product in the near future. If so, it would be appropriate to offer this technique to patients with recurrent UTI (regardless of their bacterial resistance profile). This is also yet another reason to prescribe antibiotics prudently, to prevent altering the vaginal microbiome in the first place. Patients who ask for antibiotics for inappropriate indications may respond to this teaching by their physician.",

In developed nations, the origin of skin and soft tissue infections is relatively predictable: cellulitis without purulence is usually caused by streptococcal species (including Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus pyogenes), whereas purulent infections such as \"boils,\" furuncles, carbuncles, and abscesses are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus). In a returning traveler, this pattern remains accurate (see Chapter 36). However, other pathogens should be considered as well, depending on host factors and environmental exposures. Providers must obtain a careful, detailed history in order to avoid missing drug-resistant bacterial infections. For example, the risk of MDR Gram-negative skin infections is greatly increased among patients who have undergone surgical procedures overseas or who sustained a wound exposed to fresh water. Such wounds may have become infected by environmental organisms such as Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Burkholderia, and rapidly growing mycobacteria, which can be profoundly resistant to most, if not all, antibiotics. Thus, an interdisciplinary approach is required for these patients: there should be a low threshold to admit severely infected patients to the hospital (with full and aggressive contact precautions). There, tissue and blood specimens should be submitted for culture and sensitivity testing, and consultation should be sought from specialists in both infectious diseases (because toxic medications may be necessary, such as aminoglycosides, polymyxins, or tigecycline) and surgery (because in some cases rapid debridement or even amputation may be life-saving).",
