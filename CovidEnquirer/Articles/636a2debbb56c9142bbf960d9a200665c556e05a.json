They have been widely applied in basic and translational research, such as protein interaction studies, immune profiling, vaccine development, biomarker discovery and clinical diagnostics, etc. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . For example, Zhang et al. used a human protein microarray to better understand how arsenic, which is used in chemotherapy, disrupts cancer signaling pathways and, further, to identify potential targets of novel therapeutic treatments. Of the 16,368 proteins that were screened, 360 arsenic binding proteins were identified, which may be novel targets for cancer treatment [7] . Anderson et al. used protein Ivyspring International Publisher microarrays to discover a 28-autoantibody biomarker signature of early stage breast cancer with a sensitivity and specificity of 80.8% and 61.6%, respectively [13] . By combining those autoantibodies with several protein biomarkers, Provista Diagnostics developed the first protein-based blood test for early breast cancer detection called Videssa\u00ae Breast [14] . Ayoglu et al. screened sera from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients using protein microarrays containing 11,520 purified protein fragments and then validated those results using bead-based arrays [15] . The arrays indicated that Anoctamin 2 autoantibodies and the MS-associated HLA complex DRB1*15 allele were strongly associated. Additional experiments showed that Anoctamin 2 aggregates near and inside lesions within human MS brain tissue [15] .",

Purifying proteins is labor-intensive, requires method optimization and multiple manipulations, exhibits highly variable yields of different proteins, and may not result in naturally-folded or functional mammalian products due to expression in non-mammalian systems (e.g., E. coli, yeast). Cell-free protein microarrays overcome these challenges by depositing RNA or DNA on the slide surface and rapidly expressing them just before an experiment (~2 h) through the use of various cell-free expression systems (e.g., lysate from wheat germ, insect cells, rabbit reticulocyte and human cells). Compared to purified protein microarrays, cell-free protein microarrays are more likely to produce naturally-folded mammalian proteins due to the decreased sample manipulation and use of enhanced cell extracts with native chaperone proteins. Moreover, the use of nucleic acids vastly simplifies the production of custom arrays since any protein can be produced as long as the gene-of-interest is synthesized; for example, arrays can be produced that represent a specific proteome or signaling pathway [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

This multiplexed array could be implemented during the initial functional screen, testing entire proteomes (P proteins) using only a fraction of the features (P/M). Multiplexed hits identified during the screening step could then be de-convoluted in the subsequent verification step using the standard, non-multiplexed NAPPA array where each feature displays only one protein (i.e., M=1). The objectives of the second step would be to identify which proteins were responsible for the positive multiplexed signal and to verify whether the hits were real. This approach exploits the high flexibility of cell-free microarrays, in which arrays can be customized by simply re-arraying individual plasmids encoding for the multiplexed features-of-interest.",

As the frequency of hits in the screen increases, more proteins will need to be tested as individual features during the verification step. Taken to the extreme, if one protein per multiplexed feature were a hit (hit rate = 1/M), all multiplexed features would require deconvolution, making the multiplexing approach impractical. However, such a high hit rate is not reflected by data collected by numerous studies; for example, the hit rate was < 5% in most of our previous NAPPA-based screening studies with 10k human genes ( Figure 1B) . We generated a mathematical model (Materials and Methods) to find the optimal M that would take into consideration array space and the cost of screening and verifying hits using our 10k protein human collection at different hit rates. In Figure 1C , the x-axis represents the number of genes per spot (M) while the y-axis represents the number of spots or proteins that are needed for the two-step screening process. Notably, when the hit rate is < 5% for 10k proteins, a relatively small number of spots would be needed for the entire study (screening + verification) with 5 proteins multiplexed per feature in the initial screen, thus representing a good compromise between the number of initial features screened and the subsequent number of features that would be needed for deconvolution and verification.",

As indicated in Figure 1 , we prepared NAPPA and M-NAPPA slides in parallel where NAPPA had only one plasmid per spot and M-NAPPA multiplexed five plasmids per spot. After IVTT, the protein arrays were probed with eight antibodies that bound targets ranging in size from 20 to 106 kDa (Methods and Figure S1 ).

In both cases, all of the antibodies readily detected their corresponding antigens. For the spots with similarly-sized proteins (36 kDa to 85 kDa), the signal ratio of M-NAPPA to NAPPA was 0.78\u00b10.44. For the spots containing five proteins covering a wide range of molecular weight, from 29 kDa to 106 kDa (Figure 2C) , the binding signal ratio of M-NAPPA to NAPPA was 1.03\u00b10.75 ( Figure S3) . Thus, multiplexing proteins of similar size did not confer any advantage over random multiplexing. To further demonstrate that there were no biases in the expression of different proteins produced from mixed plasmids, five-plasmid mixtures containing various combinations of seven different genes (Abl1, IA-2, GAD2, Jun, RhoU, BCL2L2 and MT3033) were co-expressed in IVTT solution and analyzed via western blot.

The arrays were then probed with a Rb1 query protein fused to HaloTag, and interactions were detected using an anti-HaloTag antibody. The Rb1-HaloTag query protein bound to several targets (red arrow) on NAPPA and M-NAPPA arrays; the query also bound to diffused targets outside of each spot, which appear as a \"ring\" around each feature (Figure 4A) . In Figure  4B , we used a flower pattern diagram to depict the multiplexed proteins on M-NAPPA (large central circle) and the deconvoluted individual proteins on NAPPA (five small connecting circles) (Materials and Methods). The blue gradient within the spot indicates target binding to the Rb1 query protein, whereas reactivity to the \"ring\" [20, 33] is indicated by a red circle around the spot. Using custom defined criteria, where the target-to-\"non-spot\" signal ratio is > 2 and the ring score is > 3, we found that 5 and 6 hits were identified on NAPPA and M-NAPPA, respectively, out of the 30 possible candidate target proteins ( Table  S2, Table S3 ). Five of the 6 hits on M-NAPPA were E1A, HPV11-E7, HPV16-E7, HPV18-E7 and HPV33-E7, which agrees with previous studies [38] [39] [40] . The sixth hit on M-NAPPA was not detected with NAPPA, thus suggesting that the hit may be a false positive. To further examine the utility of M-NAPPA to test protein-protein interactions, additional interactions were analyzed with 35 displayed proteins on NAPPA and M-NAPPA using HaloTagged-Jun, -Fos, and -LidA queries. Jun, Fos and LidA bound to their expected interaction partners (i.e., Fos, Jun and three Rab family proteins, respectively) on both M-NAPPA and NAPPA arrays (Figure S9) . Regarding the protein interactions that were identified, the spot-to-spot and zone-to-to zone CVs were 5.65\u00b12.69% and 5.75\u00b13.86% for NAPPA, respectively, and 2.55\u00b12.56% and 3.11\u00b13.46% for M-NAPPA, respectively (Table S5) .",

We previously increased feature number by printing plasmids into photolithography-etched silicon nano-wells to create a high-density NAPPA (HD-NAPPA) platform [41] . HD-NAPPA can have as many as 10k features per slide, and has successfully detected antiviral antibodies in autoimmune diseases with 761 different proteins displayed on the array in quadruplicate. These tiny wells hold only 1200 pL and use only 0.12 ng of plasmid DNA. We applied the multiplex concept to HD-NAPPA using a mixture of plasmids encoding for IA-2, GAD2 and p53 proteins. We then detected their expression and display using specific antibodies; all of these proteins were readily detectable when printed as a three-plexed mixture ( Figure S10) . We then multiplexed 4,045 tuberculosis (TB) ORFs [32] onto HD-NAPPA microarrays as four separate subarrays using three gene plasmids per well (M=3), resulting in an M-HD-NAPPA microarray displaying > 16k proteins on a single slide. This lower multiplicity was based on the mathematical model ( Figure 1C ) that took into account that the high number of conserved proteins in endemic, non-pathogenic mycobacterial species results in a higher hit rate (~10% [37] ). Over 95% of the spots generated a signal that was at least 10 SDs above the background, which indicates that the vast majority of proteins were well-expressed and displayed (Figure 6A) , with a correlation of R = 0.90 across technical replicates (Figure 6A-C) . Antibody reactivity from TB patient sera was observed with M-HD-NAPPA (Figure 6D) . The technical reproducibility of these immune-dominant antigens across different M-NAPPA arrays using the same sera was very high, with a correlation of R = 0.98 (Figure 6D-F) . All immune-dominant antigens identified with M-HD-NAPPA screening were then deconvoluted in the verification step using single protein NAPPA ( Figure 6G ) and validated with RAPID-ELISA as previously described [19] (Figure 6H ). We screened the sera from guinea pigs immunized with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a TB vaccine, using M-HD-NAPPA TB proteome microarrays. The aim of this experiment was to identify potential protective antibodies induced with BCG. The representative fluorescence images are shown in Figure 7A . Compared to the control mock sera pool using PBS buffer (n=5), four features on M-NAPPA arrays showed increased signals with the BCG samples (n=4) (Figure 7B) . To deconvolute and validate those targets, we repeated the serological assay for those candidate proteins, along with two non-responsive control proteins (Rv2077A and Rv2682c), using RAPID-ELISA and the individual sera from the guinea pigs. The antibody levels of four antigens (Rv3405c, Rv1078, Rv2853 and Rv0928) in BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs were significantly higher than that of the PBS control with a p-value <0.01 ( Figure 7C, Figure S11 ). According to the Tuberculist database (http://tuberculist.epfl.ch/), these proteins are involved in regulation, cell wall and cell processes, and are considered to be in the proline-glutamic acid / proline-protein-glutamic acid (PE/PPE) protein families ( Figure 7D ). A primary advantage of cell-free protein microarrays is that the arrays have a long shelf life. We compared the protein expression of M-NAPPA TB arrays immediately after printing and then again after 6 months of storage at room temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere. A GST-tagged protein, detected with an anti-GST antibody, was considered to be displayed if it had a signal that was two SDs above the signal of the \"non-spots.\" Over 99% of the proteins were displayed on new M-NAPPA arrays; this number, as well as the anti-GST signal intensity, did not change even after 6 months of storage ( Figure S12 ).",

However, display levels of large proteins (> 65 kD) were decreased by 60\u00b10.1% for GAD2 and 63\u00b111% for IA-2 ( Figure 2C ). This may be because the plasmids were mixed equally together based on their masses, a requirement imposed by the printing chemistry; this would result in a lower molarity of large plasmids (i.e., large proteins) relative to small plasmids in the printing mixture. Another possible reason is that larger proteins are produced more slowly than smaller proteins due to their longer mRNA sequences.",

We found M-NAPPA can be reproducibly fabricated with spot-to-spot, zone-to-zone and slide-to-slide CVs that are similar to those obtained with NAPPA ( Table S4) . The spot-to-spot and zone-to-to zone CVs for protein-protein interactions were also similar between the two array platforms (Table S5) . While the correlations within and between different M-NAPPA slides were good (i.e., R = 0.93 for both) (Figure 3 and Figure S6 ), with some size adaptation, the reproducibility could eventually be further improved with the use of automation equipment like the HS 4800 Pro Hybridization Station (Tecan Trading AG; M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland). In some ways, M-NAPPA resembles \"natural protein\" microarrays that print unpurified or partially fractionated proteins from lysates of human cells, tissues or body fluids, but in a much more controlled manner. Each feature of a natural protein microarray typically represents a mixture of unknown proteins. Thus, responsive hits on natural protein arrays require a challenging and time-consuming process to determine the identity of the protein responsible for the response. This may require further purification, identification by mass spectrometry and additional response testing of recombinant proteins [46, 47] . In the case of M-NAPPA, the identities of the proteins in each mix are known in advance and the plasmids encoding for each protein are available for secondary testing.",

            "text": "M-NAPPA would be useful in unbiased HT screening studies, such as protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, discovery of drug binding target as well as (auto)antibody biomarkers for a variety of human diseases. However, it should be noted that there are situations in which using a non-multiplexed array format would be more appropriate. For example, NAPPA should be used when investigating protein functions or when the number of proteins to be screened is low. Additional attributes of M-NAPPA should be considered as well. Large, multiplexed proteins (> 65 kDa) on M-NAPPA are displayed at a lower level (37 -40%) than their non-multiplexed counterparts ( Figure 2C ). This issue could be resolved by increasing plasmid DNA concentration before printing or reducing multiplicity per spot. Alternatively, since large proteins represent a small fraction of the proteome, a hybrid array containing multiplexed spots with plasmids encoding for proteins with low to moderate MWs and non-multiplexed spots for large proteins (> 65 kDa) could be employed. In addition, PTMs that occur during cell-free protein expression may affect the protein display or activity on M-NAPPA arrays [42] . We have observed that the human expression system contains the ability to phosphorylate some proteins (data not shown); other types of PTMs (e.g., glycosylation, acetylation) by the expression system are not well known or reported. In our studies, PTMs did not appear to affect protein expression, protein-protein interactions, or the identification of serological antigens on M-NAPPA when compared to NAPPA (Figure 2, Figures 4-7 and Figure S7 ).",
