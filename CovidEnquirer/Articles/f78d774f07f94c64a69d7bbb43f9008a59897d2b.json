However, the formulation of CPP-based therapeutics into different pharmaceutical formulations and their stability in relevant biological environments have not been given the same attention. Here, we show that a newly developed CPP, PepFect 14 (PF14), forms non-covalent nanocomplexes with short interfering RNA (siRNA), which are able to elicit efficient RNA-interference (RNAi) response in different cell-lines. RNAi effect is obtained at low siRNA doses with a unique kinetic profile. Furthermore, the solid dispersion technique is utilized to formulate PF14/siRNA nanocomplexes into solid formulations that are as active as the freshly prepared nanocomplexes in solution. Importantly, the nanocomplexes are stable and active in mediating RNAi response after incubation with simulated gastric fluid (SGF) that is highly acidic. These results demonstrate the activity of PF14 in delivering and protecting siRNA in different pharmaceutical forms and biological environments.",

            "text": "Oligonucleotide (ON)-based therapeutics have recently gained much interest as very promising drug candidates. The ability to easily design ONs to specifically repair a pathological genetic defect either on the DNA or RNA level is a remarkable advantage compared to the expensive, time-consuming screening required for small molecule drugs. Additionally, the specific targeting of a particular gene can lead to fewer side effects. Among the therapeutic modalities, which include antisense, antigene and splice-switching ONs; siRNAs gained special interest. What makes the siRNA more appealing than the other approaches is that it cleaves target mRNA in a catalytic manner with the help of the RISC complex; thus, lower doses are required to achieve gene knockdown compared to the conventional antisense approaches [1] . However, as for other ON therapeutics, siRNAs are large hydrophilic molecules that cannot bypass the hydrophobic plasma membrane barrier to reach their target mRNA in the cytoplasm. This is why tremendous research efforts have been put for the development of delivery systems for siRNA. One class of vectors that could be promising in delivering siRNA therapeutics is cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). CPPs are polybasic and/or amphipathic peptides, usually less than 30 amino acids in length that are able to traverse the plasma membrane even when coupled to large molecules or nanoparticles [2, 3] . The cargo can either be covalently linked or non-covalently complexed with the CPP. The non-covalent complexation strategy has the advantages of being more simple and versatile; thus, several CPPs have been utilized to deliver proteins, peptides, plasmids and ONs via non-covalent complexation [4, 5] . The group of Gilles Divita was the first to show that CPPs can be used to deliver ONs after non-covalent complexation using the MPG peptide [6] . Having net positive charge, MPG has been shown to form nanocomplexes with negatively charged single-and double-stranded ONs, which are efficiently internalized by cells. Since the initial publication, several CPPs have been developed that can form nanocomplexes with various nucleic acids and efficiently mediate their delivery in several in-vitro and in-vivo settings [4, 5, 7] . However, certain chemical modifications of the CPPs were needed to improve the nanoparticle formation capability and enhance membrane interaction upon non-covalent complexation. C-terminal cysteamide modification was shown to be crucial for CPP-mediated siRNA delivery using the MPG, PEP and CADY peptide families by increasing membrane association and stabilizing particle formation by the formation of peptide dimers [8] [9] [10] [11] . Acetylation of these peptides was also required to enhance stability [10] . Addition of hydrophobic moieties to CPPs has been shown to be an efficient mean to increase the efficiency of the nanocomplexes. Cholesteryl modification of polyarginines and MPG-8 was demonstrated to enhance their activity for delivery of siRNA in-vivo [12] . The group of Shiroh Futaki at Kyoto University was the first to demonstrate that stearylation of polyarginines could enhance their transfection efficiency by 100-fold [13] . In recent years, our group applied stearylation and other chemical modifications to the TP10 backbone leading to the development of the PepFect family of peptides (PFs) [14] . Stearylation enables the peptide to form more stable nanocomplexes with nucleic acids and drastically enhances the transfection efficiency compared to the non-stearylated counterparts [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Among the PepFect family, PF14 was shown to mediate efficient splice correction activity in various cell lines when complexed with splice-switching ONs. Furthermore, we found that the PF14/ON nanocomplexes can be dried into stable solid formulations via the solid-dispersion technique utilizing conventional pharmaceutical excipients [19] . Here, we show that PF14 is also capable of efficiently delivering siRNA into various cell lines both in the liquid and solid form. Most importantly, we show that PF14 solid formulations are stable in acidic simulated gastric conditions.",

Luciferase-stable HEK 293 cells were kindly provided by Professor Paavo Honkakoski (University of Kuopio) and described previously in [20] . Luciferasestable HepG2 cells were generated by lentiviral transduction under the control of CMV promoter.

All cell lines were grown in DMEM medium with glutamax (Invitrogen, Sweden) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). Jurkat cells (ATCC) were grown in 10% FBS-RPMI-1640 media, supplemented with 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin).

Aqueous solutions of PF14/siRNA were added to the cells to give a final a concentration of siRNA ranging between 6 and 100 nM. Transfections were performed in both serum and serum-free conditions, where serum was added to the cells to the final concentration of 10% after 4 h of transfection. The known transfection reagents Lipofectamine 2000 (LF 2000) and Lipofectamine RNAimax\u00ae (LF RNAimax) (Invitogen) was used as a control.

NTA is a new system for sizing particles that was first commercialized in 2006. This technique combines laser light scattering microscopy with a CCD camera, which enables the visualization and recording of nanoparticles in solution [21] . The NTA software is then able to identify and track individual nanoparticles moving under Brownian motion and relates the movement to a particle size according to a formula derived from the Stokes-Einstein equation. This particle-by-particle methodology provides highresolution particle size distributions compared to traditional light scattering and other ensemble techniques [21] . Additionally, it measures concentration and validates all data with video files of the particles moving under Brownian motion. The freshly prepared formulation showed a particle size mean of 125 nm when measured in water and it was insignificantly different from that measured in serum-containing medium. This demonstrates the tolerability of the particles to serum. When the solid formulation of PF14/siRNA was measured, it showed a mean particle size of 119 nm, which again was insignificantly different from the same formulation when measured in serum-containing medium. This similarity demonstrates the stability of the particles after the solid dispersion procedure (Fig. 4) . Additionally, we measured the zeta potential of the nanocomplexes in the solid formulation to determine the surface properties that are crucial for activity. We found that, when resuspended in water, the nanocomplexes possess a positive zeta potential (22.74\u00b10.49 mV). However, when resuspended in the biorelevant OptiMEM\u00ae medium, the zeta potential is reversed to negative values; -12.98 \u00b10.63 mV and \u22128.54\u00b10.32 mV in the absence and presence of serum respectively. This trend follows the same pattern demonstrated before by PF14 nanocomplexes with splice-switching ONs [22] and highlights the effect of medium on the physical properties and hence the uptake mechanism of the nanocomplexes.",

            "text": "ON-based therapeutics represent the most direct way to translate genomic data into therapeutics by targeting specific DNA or RNA sequences. However, the bulky and hydrophilic nature of ONs hinders their accessibility to intracellular targets across the plasma membrane. For these reasons, many delivery technologies were developed to carry ONs across the cellular membrane barrier. Much of the research focus was specifically toward developing siRNA delivery vectors because of the favorable pharmacodynamic profile of siRNA over other ONs. This is due to the catalytic nature of its gene silencing effect. Cationic lipid formulations have been extensively utilized as siRNA vehicles and widely used as transfection reagents in-vitro; e.g. Lipofectamine\u00ae. However, only a limited number have been successfully used in-vivo due to their poor colloidal stability and toxicological concerns [23, 24] . The new generation of lipid-based siRNA vectors like SNALPs [25] and Lipidoids [26] has probably overcome some of these limitations; however, the complex multicomponent nature of such systems could limit them from being widely used. Alternatively, complex-forming CPPs represent a single-step system for efficient delivery of siRNAs. We have previously shown that PepFect6 (PF6), a chemically modified CPP, can efficiently deliver siRNA to in-vitro in several hard-to-transfect cell-lines and in different organs following systemic delivery in mice without any associated toxicity [18] . PF6 and PF14 both belong to the PepFect chemically-modified CPP family developed in our lab. They are based on the TP10 peptide with added chemical modifications to enhance complex formation, stability, uptake and endosomal release [14, 17, 8] . In the case of PF14, it is N-terminally stearylated and contains several ornithine residues. Stearylation of CPPs enhances the complex formation capacity of the CPP with nucleic acids and can enhance endosomal escape [16, 17] . On the other hand, ornithines, being nonstandard amino acids, would render the peptide more resistant to serum proteases [19] . PF14 proved to be very efficient in the delivery of single-stranded ONs for splice correction in solution and in solid formulation [19] . In this study, we wanted to test the activity of PF14 in delivering siRNAs and whether the solid formulation approach would also be successfully applicable for this type of ONs as well. Furthermore, we wanted to extend the process of pharmaceutical development C D B A Fig. 2 . PF14 induces knock-down of an endogenous gene with a unique kinetic profile. A.

Comparison between the efficiency of one selected dose (50 nM) of siRNA transfected by PF14 or by LF RNAimax\u00ae or naked siRNA without any transfection reagent. Control siRNA of unrelated sequence at the same concentration transfected with PF14 was also included. C and D: Kinetics of the HPRT1 down-regulation using a 50 nM dose of siRNA transfected with PF14 at serum-containing and serum-free conditions and with LF RNAimax\u00ae. C. represents the kinetics up to 24 h while D. shows the time-course study as monitored up to 4 days. Significant differences were detected in the % of HPRT1 mRNA remaining after 2 h using PF14 (in serum free) and LF RNAimax\u00ae (Pb 0.001) and after 4 h (Pb 0.01). Significant difference was seen as well between treatment with PF14 (in serum) and LF RNAimax\u00ae after 2 h (Pb 0.05). Fig. 3 . PF14/siRNA nanocomplexes can be formulated in solid form using the solid dispersion technique. Mannitol solution was prepared at final concentration of 100 mg/ml in MQ water. PF14/siRNA nanocomplexes were prepared in 25 \u03bcl final volume and mixed with the mannitol solution to the final concentrations of 5% mannitol in the reaction mixture. The final volume of the mixture was 50 \u03bcl. The mixture was then dried in speed-vac for 2 h, during which the temperature ranged between 55 and 60\u00b0C. Before transfection, the dried powder was reconstituted in 50 \u03bcl of MQ water and added to the wells. HEK 293 luciferase-stable cells (5\u00d710 4 ) were treated with reconstituted nanocomplexes in serum containing or serum-free medium. Cells were then lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 and luciferase activity was measured. RNAi assay results are presented as percent of luciferase expression relative to untreated cells (control). of such nanocomplexes by testing their stability in simulated gastric conditions; a model for oral administration.",

Interestingly, PF14/siRNA nanocomplexes mediated efficient RNAi knock-down of luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner at different MRs. More than 80% down-regulation of luciferase expression was obtained at the best MRs (Fig. 1) . The knock-down was achieved at relatively low doses of siRNA and the effect was maintained in the presence of serum. Next, we used the nanocomplexes to downregulate an endogenous mRNA and quantified the response using q RT-PCR. PF14/siRNA nanocomplexes demonstrated a very low EC 50 in both serum and serum-free media with more than 70% knock-down in the first 2 h, significantly surpassing LF RNAimax (Fig. 2) . Surprisingly, the RNAi effect was maintained up to 4 days confirming the sustainable activity of the nanocomplexes. Endogenous gene knock-down was also demonstrated in the Jurkat suspension cell-line, which is known to be hard-to-transfect ( Supplementary Fig. 1) .",

            "text": "Having proven the efficiency in different cell-lines in the presence or absence of serum, we wanted to test the activity and stability of the nanocomplexes if formulated into a solid form, which can have several pharmaceutical benefits. Solid pharmaceutical forms are the most widely used drug formulations due to patient convenience and high stability profiles. They are usually used for oral and respiratory administration as tablets, capsules and powders for inhalation. Furthermore, they are used in powders for injection to enhance the stability of intravenous formulations and facilitate transport and storage. Active and stable solid formulations for siRNA could add new opportunities to the applicability of the RNAi technology and would be a proof-ofconcept that delivery technologies can transform siRNA from being a powerful laboratory tool into a viable drug product. Utilizing the solid formulation, siRNAs against various pathogenic targets can be designed and utilized via the oral or pulmonary pathways. For example, siRNAs against hepatitis C virus (HCV), hypercholesterolemia and irritable bowel diseases can be utilized via the oral route and siRNAs against cystic fibrosis, influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections can be utilized via the pulmonary route. Here, we applied the technology that we used for PF14 formulation with single-stranded ONs; the solid dispersion technique. It is based on mixing the nanocomplexes with a solution of a soluble excipient, which will be the solid dispersant, then drying out the solvent; water in this case. In this way the nanocomplexes will uniformly distribute over the solid matrix. To evaporate water we dried the mixtures at 50-60\u00b0C under vacuum and centrifugation utilizing speed-vac. Although this procedure is fairly harsh due to the relatively high temperature and pressure that the nanocomplexes are subjected to, it is much cheaper to scale-up if such formulations are to be mass produced compared to the lyophilization techniques. From the different excipients we tested (data not shown); mannitol at the concentration Fig. 4 . PF14 forms definite nanocomplexes with siRNA that are stable upon drying and resuspension. Nanocomplexes, both freshly prepared and the in solid formulation, were studied using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) system. A. The freshly prepared nanocomplexes measured in water. B. The freshly prepared nanocomplexes measured in OptiMEM\u00ae with 10% FBS, C. the solid formulation measured in water, D. the solid formulation measured in OptiMEM\u00ae with 10% FBS. The graphs on the middle panels show the size distribution of the particles with the particle size plotted on the x-axis and the particles concentration (E6/ml) plotted on the y-axis. The graphs on the rightmost panels are 3D plots (size vs. intensity vs. concentration), while the leftmost panels show the corresponding NTA video frames. In middle panels for samples B and D, the yellow curves represent the size distribution measured for the vehicle alone which is OptiMEM\u00ae with 10% FBS. D50: the diameter where half of the population lies below, D90: the diameter where 90% of the population lies below. of 5% was the most active and mediated an RNAi effect that is not significantly different from the freshly-prepared nanocomplexes (Fig. 3) . These results agree with our earlier data for PF14 nanocomplexes with singlestranded ONs and confirm that PF14 indeed forms stable nanocomplexes that can withstand formulation conditions.",

The mean particle size was not significantly different between the freshly prepared formulation and after solid dispersion either in water or serum-containing medium (Fig. 4) . This demonstrates that the nanocomplexes remain intact in different media and can withstand the drying and dispersion conditions. However, the surface charge (zeta potential) was dependent on the dispersion medium. When dispersed in water, the nanocomplexes in solid formulation were positively charged, but upon dispersion in a biorelevant medium (OptiMEM\u00ae) with or without serum, the nanocomplexes became negatively charged. We have recently shown similar behavior for PF14 nanocomplexes with single-stranded ONs and that such nanocomplexes were taken-up into cells via the class A scavenger receptors [22] . The net negative charge of PF14/siRNA nanocomplexes implies that they recruit the same pathway.",

PF14/siRNA solid formulations were prepared at MR30 using 50 nM siRNA, and then the solid dispersion method was applied using mannitol at a concentration of 5%. Freshly prepared nanocomplexes and solid formulations were then incubated with SGF with or without pepsin or with water for 30 min before addition to the cells. After incubation, HEK 293 luciferase stable cells (5 \u00d7 10 4 ) were treated with the nanocomplexes for 4 h in serumfree medium followed by addition of serum to final concentration of 10% and incubated additionally for 20 h. Cells were then lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 and luciferase activity was measured. RNAi assay results are presented as percent of luciferase expression relative to control wells where only SGF was added. B. Solid formulations were reconstituted in water then incubated for 30 min in SGF with or without pepsin. Mean size of the particles was 149 nm in case of SGF and 183 nm in SGF with pepsin.",
