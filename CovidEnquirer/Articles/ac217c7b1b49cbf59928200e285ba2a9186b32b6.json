            "text": "Objective: To evaluate whether the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory of five circuits and six qi (FCSQ) is beneficial in terms of improving clinical effectiveness. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the clinical value of FCSQ theory were reviewed. Multiple databases (China Network Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journals Database, Wanfang Data, SinoMed, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase) were systematically searched from inception to June 12, 2018. Two authors independently extracted the data and performed a methodological quality assessment of the RCTs. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the data analysis. The effect sizes for the primary outcome measures were expressed as relative risks or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 13 RCTs were selected, involving 12 types of diseases and 4695 patients. The methodological quality of the RCTs was generally low. Five studies compared the effectiveness of TCM treatments guided by FCSQ theory with conventional TCM therapies, and the remaining eight studies compared the effectiveness of TCM treatments guided by FCSQ theory with biomedical treatments. All of the RCTs reported that the effectiveness of the treatment intervention was better than that of the intervention in the control group. Conclusion: Because of many methodological problems in existing clinical studies, it remains impossible to definitively conclude that FCSQ theory can improve clinical effectiveness. It is difficult to unify the clinical application of FCSQ theory. The feasibility and repeatability of FCSQ as an intervention should be given more attention in future clinical research. Future work should also follow international norms for clinical research implementation and reporting to provide high-quality evidence for evaluating the clinical value of FCSQ theory.",

            "text": "The theory of five circuits and six qi (FCSQ; five circuits refers to wood, fire, earth, metal, and water; six qi indicate wind, cold, summer heat, dampness, dryness, fire) is an essential part of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The theory represents a holistic view held by early doctors based on the correspondence between heaven and humankind. It is a doctrine for understanding the laws of nature and climate change, as well as their impact on human diseases. FCSQ theory, which is based on the theory of yin and yang and uses symbols such as \"heaven\" and \"earth\" as deductive tools, has been passed down from the era of Yellow Emperor's Canon of Medicine. Using current meteorological data and data on the incidence of diseases, scholars have conducted a series of studies to evaluate the correlations between FCSQ and climate change, occurrence of diseases, and TCM patterns. 1\u00c04 These studies have found varying levels of correlation between the complete meteorological data, based on continuous modern meteorological observations, and the climate mode deduced from FCSQ. Furthermore, a relationship between FCSQ and common diseases has been found in some internal medicine and TCM patterns. All of this previous work has objectively proven that FCSQ exerts an influence on human life activities and provided a basis for using FCSQ theory to treat diseases in TCM clinical practice. Unique effects were observed for TCM treatments guided by FCSQ theory for epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis in North China in the 1950s and severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2003. 5 In recent years, a number of studies on FCSQ have been published.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the clinical value of FCSQ theory is very controversial in the field of TCM, and doubts have existed since the theory's emergence. Some medical doctors have explicitly opposed FCSQ theory. For example, in the Ming Dynasty, Xiyong Miu wrote a chapter entitled \"On the falseness of FCSQ\" in his book, Commentary on Shen Nong's Classic of the Materia Medica. He believed that what was called FCSQ theory by later generations was not beneficial for treatment, because there was no mention of FCSQ recorded in the books written by Zhongjing Zhang, Tuo Hua, Shuhe Wang, and others. Xiyong Miu therefore denied the significance of FCSQ theory in TCM. During the Republic of China era (1911e1949), two important controversies regarding FCSQ occurred in the field of TCM, and stances denying or proposing the abolishment of FCSQ theory were predominant. Yuanlei Lu, one of the representatives of this view, published an article entitled \"Overthrowing FCSQ fundamentally\" in 1934 to express the idea that there is no reason for FCSQ theory to exist. 6 Currently, the body of work on FCSQ is increasing, but applications of the theory have not been given much importance in mainstream TCM clinical practice. Is FCSQ theory beneficial for improving the effectiveness of treatments? To answer this question, it is insufficient to rely on traditional literature reviews, theoretical derivations, or medical reports. Therefore, to provide evidence-based medical evidence on this controversial issue in the field of TCM, we systematically collected and evaluated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined FCSQ theory in the treatment of diseases.",

            "text": "In this study, 13 RCTs evaluating the safety and effectiveness of applying FCSQ theory to treat diseases were systematically reviewed. The effectiveness of TCM treatments in the FCSQ treatment groups was higher, compared with the effectiveness of either conventional TCM treatments without guidance from FCSQ theory or Western medicine treatments, and these differences were significant. However, because of the low methodological quality of the included studies and inability to rule out publication bias, we cannot definitively conclude that FCSQ theory improves the effectiveness of TCM. The results in our study are similar to those of a 2014 narrative review by Liu et al, 21 which evaluated four RCTs and two case reports that used FCSQ theory. This previous review pointed out that there have been few evaluations of the effectiveness of applications of FCSQ theory in clinical trials, that the research quality has been low, that there has been obvious publication bias in case reports, and that the demonstration of causal relationships has been weak; therefore, a precise conclusion on FCSQ treatment could not be drawn. In contrast to this previous article, we adopted the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias and included all published RCTs on the evaluation of the clinical effectiveness of FCSQ, thus avoiding selection bias in our literature search. Additionally, we summarized the ways in which FCSQ theory has been applied in existing clinical research. We found that the methodological quality of relevant studies published in recent years had not significantly improved, compared with earlier work. Two types of methodological problems were common in the included RCTs. The first type includes common problems in TCM clinical research. 22e24 For example, the examined studies do not design, perform, or report on research in accordance with international standards on clinical research; the details of the random allocation are inappropriately concealed (or may even not be reported at all); there is a lack of information on the sample size calculation; the studies do not report on study dropouts or provide intention-to-treat analyses of their data; evaluations of subjective outcomes are performed without blinding; and there is no clinical trial registration, resulting in an inability to judge publication bias, selective reporting bias, and other biases. The other type of problem is specific to the formulation of control treatments and FCSQinformed interventions. First, the main FCSQ-specific problem is the unreasonable design of control treatments. Western medicine alone has been used in the control group in many studies, without including a group receiving conventional TCM treatment without FCSQ as a control. In this case, even if the effectiveness of the FCSQ treatment is higher than that of the treatment in the control group, we can only reach the conclusion that the effectiveness of TCM is better than that of Western medicine; with this study design, it is impossible to prove whether or not the observed effectiveness is the result of guidance by FCSQ theory. Second, no reliable evidence is provided on the formulation of interventions for FCSQ treatment groups, leading to problematic performance and poor repeatability. In most studies, the FCSQ treatment interventions were based on the researchers' own experience or prescriptions devised by the researchers with consideration of the features of FCSQ. These studies have usually not reported the rules applied for herbal prescription or even defined whether their interventions were related to FCSQ theory. For instance, in a clinical trial for treating hypertension based on FCSQ theory, 14 the Wumei Pill from Treatise on Cold Damage was used in the FCSQ treatment group. The authors analyzed the FCSQ characteristics only in the year of the study and stated that the Wumei Pill was effective for hypertension occurring in that year; they did not clarify the evidence for formulating prescriptions based on aspects of FCSQ theory. In terms of how FCSQ theory is applied, we can conclude that applications considering the characteristics of the \"heavenly stems and earthly branches\" are the most common in clinical practice. The various problems that occurred in designing interventions for FCSQ treatment groups suggest that the feasibility and repeatability of FCSQ interventions should be given more attention in future clinical research to provide high-quality evidence for assessing the clinical value of FCSQ theory.",

Furthermore, the particularity of FCSQ clinical research should be fully considered. First, future work should select diseases that are strongly correlated with FCSQ. Second, it is important to design a reasonable control treatmentdA conventional TCM treatment without FCSQ is usually needed as a control intervention, and, if possible, a Western medicine treatment or placebo control is desirable. Third, the determination of FCSQ interventions should have sufficient justification, good operability, and repeatability. We recommend referring to well-recognized FCSQ formulae recorded in the early FCSQ literature, such as the therapeutic principles in the \"seven great chapters\" on FCSQ in Yellow Emperor's Canon of Medicine and the monograph on FCSQ theory, Sanyin Sitian Fang, produced during the Northern Song Dynasty. Corresponding intervention measures should then be determined in accordance with the specific characteristics of the \"heavenly stems and earthly branches\" during that month and year.",

Although there are many methodological shortcomings in the current literature and the value of FCSQ theory cannot be fully affirmed, its application value in clinical practice is undeniable. The present study provides a reference for the clinical application of FCSQ theory in TCM in the future. Only by combining the characteristics of FCSQ theory in TCM, adopting appropriate clinical research methods, designing reasonable study protocols, and following international guidelines for designing and reporting clinical research can we provide more substantial evidence for the clinical application of FCSQ theory.",
