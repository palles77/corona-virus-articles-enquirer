It was also agreed that WHO would provide the secretariat to support the Steering Committee and provide operational support to develop the network, and in collaboration with staff in relevant WHO Departments, Programmes and Offices, to provide communications support and advocacy for the network, and to coordinate and support field missions and response activities. In addition, WHO would mobilise and provide much of the financial support for GOARN. These activities place WHO at the centre of the core functioning of the network, and thus questions could be raised about the relative independence of the network, and specifically whether WHO's role is as one of the partners in the network, or whether GOARN should be considered as a more formal initiative of WHO. The majority of partners, when approached during an external review of GOARN, believed that the balance between integration into WHO's operations and network independence was about right, and most recognised WHO as the dominant partner. GOARN is thus recognised by WHO as the body able to provide the broad technical expertise necessary to enable it to assist member states with outbreak response, and more recently, as the 'operational arm' of the new International Health Regulations (IHR; 2005). These issues have been discussed elsewhere by Ansell, Sondorp, and Stevens (2012) .",

In early meetings, the Steering Committee monitored the operation and outcomes of field missions and used these reviews to provide important suggestions for future deployments.

This is both consistent with the principle of bringing the most proximate resources to bear as rapidly as possible and leveraging network activities to develop as well as employ partner institutional capacity. While this has been generally successful, there are still gaps that need to be filled over coming years.",

            "text": "There has been a continual emergence and resurgence of epidemic-prone infectious diseases and of novel, previously unrecognised emerging diseases that threaten global health and economic stability, many of which have resulted in GOARN missions to affected member states and regions (Breiman et al., 2003; Formenty et al., 2005; Mackenzie, 2011; Mackenzie et al., 2004) . Since 2000, WHO has supported and coordinated the network activities to provide an operational framework for GOARN partners to respond to major outbreaks of cholera, dengue, encephalitis, influenza, meningitis, Nipah, plague, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF), yellow fever and other emerging and epidemic-prone pathogens. Partners have also provided experts for deployment to assist in addressing infectious disease impacts of major humanitarian crises, including natural disasters. Overall, GOARN Note: Shaded countries have no partner or hub at this time. The figures in boxes provide the number of partners and network hubs in each WHO region (AMRO = Regional Office of the Americas; AFRO = African Regional Office; EURO = European Regional Office; EMRO = Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office; SEARO = South-East Asian Regional Office; WPRO = Western Pacific Regional Office). (Table 2 ). In keeping with the guiding principles agreed by partners, all missions have been to support national health authorities and were initiated at the invitation or request of the affected WHO member state(s). The primary aim has been to provide rapid support for outbreak response. However, these missions have also influenced the development of local, national and international capacities and supported more long-term initiatives and relationships. More could be done to document and develop this contribution of GOARN partners. Alerts, requests for assistance, operational updates, offers of technical support and details of deployments (in clinical management, epidemiology, infection control, laboratory support, social mobilisation, risk communications and logistics) are posted on the GOARN SharePoint website, which also provides a mechanism to assist in communications between the operational support team and GOARN partners. Partner institutions able to respond to requests for assistance nominate expert staff members for deployment, based on a number of factors including expertise in the areas specified by the health authorities in the affected country and appropriate language skills. In most instances, the period of deployment varies between one and four weeks. Terms of reference for field missions and individual deployments are negotiated and agreed in advance with the responsible health authorities in affected countries and the framework. The number of deployments of WHO and non-WHO personnel and their fields of expertise are shown in Figure 2 . In the first years of GOARN operation, field missions were largely in response to outbreaks of disease in single countries, particularly outbreaks of VHF in African countries. These missions sometimes required significant numbers of deployments before the outbreak ended, as occurred during the 2000 outbreak of Ebola in Gulu, Uganda (Lamunu et al., 2004; Okware et al., 2002) . Other outbreaks focused on unusual manifestations, such as the high death rate from an outbreak of influenza in Madagascar (WHO-GOARN Investigation Team, 2002) .",

GOARN played a significant role in the rapid deployment of international teams for missions to China, Hong Kong SAR, Vietnam and Singapore, as well as supporting the participation of a large number of experts from partner institutions in virtual networks which were rapidly established to investigate the novel, previously unknown infectious agent as well as its epidemiology, infection control and clinical course of disease. The role of WHO and the contribution of GOARN partners has been discussed in detail elsewhere (Heymann, 2004; Mackenzie et al., 2004; WHO, 2006) . The SARS global response provided important lessons for the teams at WHO regional offices, particularly the Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO), and at WHO headquarters, as well as GOARN partners. SARS highlighted the technical and operational challenges of identifying and deploying international teams to respond simultaneously to requests for assistance from multiple countries. The contribution of GOARN partners to controlling SARS was recognised by the WHA, which urged the member states to 'continue to collaborate with and, when appropriate, provide assistance to WHO's GOARN as the operational arm of the global response', and requested the director general to 'strengthen the functions of WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network' (WHO, 2003) .",

The use of a field laboratory to provide rapid diagnosis was first successfully employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the Ebola outbreak in Gulu, Uganda, in 2000-2001, using antigen capture and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to diagnose infection in suspect patients and based in one of the two major hospitals in Gulu (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2001; Okware et al., 2002; Towner et al., 2004) . The same laboratory also assisted in the rapid diagnosis of patients in a secondary outbreak in Masindi, 170 km south of Gulu (Borchert et al., 2011) . The success of the laboratory in Gulu prompted further developments in truly mobile laboratories for the diagnosis of haemorrhagic fever cases and to assist epidemiological surveillance, and two novel mobile laboratories were subsequently employed successfully during the Marburg virus outbreak in Angola in 2005, with one laboratory in Uige, the epicentre of the outbreak, operated by the Public Health Agency of Canada (Grolla et al., 2011) using quantitative real-time PCR, and a second laboratory operated by CDC in the capital, Luanda, using a new, safe, rapid and reliable highthroughput protocol for RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Towner, Sealy, Ksiazek, & Nichol, 2007) . There was a high concordance in test results between the two laboratories, strongly suggesting that field capacity should be enhanced and expanded and be an essential component in future outbreak investigations. A large, shipping container-sized mobile laboratory was developed by members of the Universiti Malaysia Sarawak and successfully deployed to Meulaboh, Aceh Province, during the tsunami relief activities.",

Subsequently, WHO regional offices and headquarters provided further training courses, primarily to develop regional capacity for international response. A faculty drawn from GOARN partners and from across WHO has developed and adapted training material, and provided training on field team leadership, management of complex international outbreak response, disease-specific scenarios and rapid containment operations. In the Western Pacific Region, GOARN partners and WHO have collaborated in innovative training approaches and pilot courses.

The OVL was disseminated to subscribers, including WHO staff worldwide, UN agencies, national health authorities, WHO collaborating centres, field epidemiology programmes and NGOs, many of which were also GOARN partners at the time (Grein et al., 2000) .",

To support this, further partner institutions will be sought to expand the broad geographic range. In addition, partner institutions will be encouraged to assist the member states in capacity-building in order to fully develop core capacities required for compliance in the revised IHR. The breadth of expertise will be expanded to incorporate the capacity to respond to chemical events or toxic additions to food or accidental release into the environment. These and other initiatives are currently under discussion by the Steering Committee. 1",
