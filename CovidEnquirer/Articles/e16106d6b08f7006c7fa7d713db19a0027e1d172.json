            "text": "Colibacillosis results from infection with avian pathogenic Escherichia coli bacteria. Healthy broilers are resistant to inhaled E. coli, but previous infection with vaccine or virulent strains of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) predisposes birds for severe colibacillosis. We investigated whether IBV affects recruitment and function of phagocytic cells and examined NO production, phagocytic and bactericidal activity, and kinetics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and splenocytes. Moreover, we measured cytokine mRNA expression in lung and spleen samples. Broilers were inoculated with IBV H120 vaccine or virulent M41 and challenged 5 days later with E. coli 506. A PBS control and E. coli group without previous virus inoculation were also included. Birds were sacrificed at various time points after inoculation (h/dpi). Inoculation with IBV induced extended and more severe colibacillosis than with E. coli alone. At 4 dpi, the number of KUL-01 + PBMC in all E. coli-inoculated groups was significantly higher than in PBS-inoculated birds, which correlated with lesion scores. From 1 to 4 dpi, NO production by PBMC from all E. coliinoculated animals was elevated compared to PBS birds. Bactericidal activity of PBMC in IBV-inoculated animals at 7 dpi was lower than in PBS-and E. coli-inoculated birds, but phagocytic capacity and recruitment were not severely impaired. In spleen samples of IBV-infected animals reduced expression of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18 and IFN-g mRNA was found 1 dpi. Our results suggest that enhanced colibacillosis after IBV infection or vaccination is caused at least by altered innate immunity and less by impairment of phagocytic cell function. #",

In chickens, turkeys and ducks colibacillosis is often observed secondary to infection with respiratory agents e.g. Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), Newcastle Disease Virus, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum (Igbokwe et al., 1996; Nakamura et al., 1994) . In mice, influenza virus www.elsevier.com/locate/vetimm increases susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (Seki et al., 2004; Speshock et al., 2007) and measles virus predisposes for a range of bacterial infections such as Listeria monocytogenes (Slifka et al., 2003) . In cattle, susceptibility for pneumonic pasteurellosis is greatly enhanced by a variety of respiratory viruses including bovine respiratory syncytial virus (Liu et al., 1999) , bovine herpes virus-1 (Leite et al., 2002) and bovine coronavirus (Storz et al., 2000) . In man, pneumonia has been a leading cause of death during influenza pandemics, supporting the widely held view that influenza virus predisposes for streptococcal infections (McCullers, 2006) .",

A first set of hypotheses suggests increased susceptibility due to tissue damage in the respiratory tract resulting in functional impairment. Three possible causes have been described as mechanisms for functional damage. Viral replication in the upper respiratory tract causes loss of cilia and ciliated cells (Bakaletz, 1995) , decreased ciliary activity impairs mucociliary clearance (Wilson et al., 1996) and finally, damage to epithelium may provide more attachment sites for bacteria (Ahmer et al., 1999) .",

Goren (1978) developed an experimental model in broilers that demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to Escherichia coli after inoculation with IBV. Moreover, not only a virulent strain (IBV M41) enhanced inflammatory reactions on superinfection with E. coli, but the mild IBV vaccine strain (IBV H120) widely used in the field also enhanced susceptibility in a very similar way (Matthijs et al., 2003) .",

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA was eluted in 30 ml RNase-free water and stored at \u00c080 8C. Reverse transcription was performed using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Biorad). Primers and probes (Applied Biosystems) were designed according to Kaiser et al. (2003) and Rothwell et al. (2004) and are listed in Table 1 . For the quantitative RT-PCR assay TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used. Primers were used at 300 nM and probes at 100 nM concentration. Amplification and detection of specific products was achieved with the MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with the following cycle profile: one cycle of 50 8C for 2 min, one cycle of 95 8C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 8C for 10 s and 59 8C for 1 min. Results were expressed as fold changes between samples, relative to the PBS group (Philbin et al., 2005) . To correct for variation in RNA preparation and sampling, Ct values for cytokine-specific product for each sample were standardized using the Ct value of 28S-specific product for the same sample. To normalize RNA levels between samples within an experiment, the mean Ct value for 28S-specific product was calculated by pooling Ct values of all samples in that experiment. Well-to-well variations in Ct value of 28S-specific product about the experimental mean were calculated. The slope of the 28S dilution series regression lines was used to calculate differences in input of total RNA. Fold differences in cytokine expression between treatment groups were calculated relative to the reference ribosomal RNA, using a method adapted from Philbin et al. (2005) . Fold differences were calculated from the C T values C (for the cytokine) and C 0 (for ribosomal RNA) using the equation 10 log R \u00f0A=B\u00de \u00bc \u00bd\u00f0C A \u00c0 C B \u00de=S \u00c0 \u00bd\u00f0C 0 A \u00c0 C 0 B \u00de=S 0 , where S and S 0 are, respectively, the slopes of plots of C T value against the 10 logarithm of concentration for serial dilutions of cytokine DNA and ribosomal RNA, assayed on the same plate. This calculation avoids assumptions about the efficiency of the PCR amplifications and reduces to the common DDC T method in the case that both have perfect efficiency.",

IFNg is a potent macrophage-activating factor and IL-18 is an important inducer of IFNg production (Wigley and Kaiser, 2003) . Both IFNg and IL-18 are strongly linked to a cell-mediated Th1-like immune response (Staeheli et al., 2001) . IL-10 on the other hand is a promotor of Th2-like immune responses, predominantly by inhibiting pro-inflammatory and Th1 cytokines (Rothwell et al., 2004) , which can increase host susceptibility to bacterial diseases through its anti-inflammatory effects, including suppression of macrophage function. Previous studies in chickens showed that IL-10 production could be accompanied by either downregulation of IFNg production (Abdul-Careem et al., 2007; Rothwell et al., 2004) , but also by concurrent upregulation of IL-10 and IFNg (Hong et al., 2006) . Moreover, it should be noted that IL-10 is known to have immunostimulatory effects in certain species, inducing MHC class II upregulation and cytotoxic T-cell stimulation (Groux and Cottrez, 2003) . In our chicken model, we find that high mRNA expression of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines at 1 dpi in spleen samples is not found in the birds that were inoculated with IBV and E. coli, but only in the E. coli inoculated birds, and thus seems to be associated with recovery of colibacillosis. The differences in mRNA expression are consistent with the finding that virus-induced modulation of the immune response plays an important role in the susceptibility to subsequent bacterial infection.",
