During 2011, a scarlet fever epidemic characterized by peak monthly incidence rates 2.9-6.7 times higher than those in 2006-2010 occurred in Beijing, China. During the epidemic, hospital-based enhanced surveillance for scarlet fever and pharyngitis was conducted to determine characteristics of circulating GAS strains. The surveillance identified 3,359 clinical cases of scarlet fever or pharyngitis. GAS was isolated from 647 of the patients; 76.4% of the strains were type emm12, and 17.1% were emm1. Almost all isolates harbored superantigens speC and ssa. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, and resistance rates were 96.1% to erythromycin, 93.7% to tetracycline, and 79.4% to clindamycin. Because emm12 type GAS is not the predominant type in other countries, wider surveillance for the possible spread of emm12 type GAS from China to other countries is warranted.",

Moreover, GAS can cause rheumatic fever and acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (1, 2) . In the late1980s, a change in the epidemiology of invasive GAS diseases and the emergence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome were documented (3, 4) , and the current number of invasive GAS disease cases worldwide is high (2) .",

Scarlet fever outbreaks also occurred in Hong Kong and Shanghai, China, during 2011, and emm12 was the predominant circulating type (28) (29) (30) . These findings suggest that some intrinsic factors might have facilitated the spread of emm12 strains and led to the epidemic. Two previously unreported genomic insertions (64.9 kb and 46.4 kb) were identified in emm12 GAS strains isolated during the 2011 scarlet fever outbreak in Hong Kong. However, analysis of emm12 strains isolated during 2005-2010 showed that the insertions were also present in those strains (28) , and the study concluded that mobile genetic elements, environmental factors, and host immune status might have contributed to the 2011 scarlet fever outbreak in Hong Kong.",
