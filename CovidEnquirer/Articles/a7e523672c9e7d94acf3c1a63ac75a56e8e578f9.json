Most of gene activation due cytokine mediated but which are due to methylation mediated is still unknown. In the study, DNA methylome was integrated with our previous transcriptome data to investigate the differentially methylated regions and genes using MeDIP-chip technology. We found that the transcriptional expressions of 15, 37 and 18 genes were negatively related with their promoter DNA methylation levels in the cells treated by PolyI:C, Aza-CdR, as well as PolyI:C plus Aza-CdR, respectively, compared with the untreated cells. GO analysis revealed hypo-methylated genes (BNIP3L and CDK9) and a hyper-methylated gene (ZC3HAV1) involved in the host response to viral replication. Our results suggest that these novel genes targeted by DNA methylation can be potential markers relevant to virus replication and host innate immune response to set up a medical model of infectious diseases.

Nowadays, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), class swine fever virus (CSFV) and many other RNA viruses are threatening the porcine health worldwide. During the replication of the viruses in swine cells, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is normally produced by most RNA viruses. The majority diseases of economic importance in swine industry such as Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), Classical swine fever (CSF), Swine vesicular disease (SVD), Foot and mouth disease (FMD), Transmissible gastroenteritis of pigs (TGE) and Influenza are caused by RNA viruses. The dsRNA intermediates during virus replication induce host innate immune response. During innate immune response, host toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes these genomic viral dsRNA generated during viral replication [1] . The interaction of dsRNA with TLR3 is a potent inducer of type I IFN cascade genes for antiviral action.",

DNA methylation is one kind of key factors in epigenetic modifications [2, 4] .

To clearly map the patterns of DNA methylation on promoters, each promoter was divided into two regions relative to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of a gene: proximal (\u2212200 to +200 bp) and intermediate (\u2212800 to \u2212200 bp) (Fig. 1) . Each region was then identified as methylated (represented as '1') or unmethylated ('0') based on the enrichment peaks of DNA methylation. Thus different promoters were classified into four types: '00', '11', '10' and '01' were denoted as extensively unmethylated (two regions are both non-peakfinding), fully methylated (two regions are both peak-finding), intermediate methylated (the region of \u2212800 to \u2212200 bp is peak-finding) and proximally methylated (the region of \u2212200 to +200 bp is peak-finding), respectively (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1A ).",

When DEP was identified in PolyI:C treated group not in control group, we defined it as up-methylated DEP in P vs. C. In contrast, if DEP was detected in control group not in PolyI:C treated group, it was defined as downmethylated DEP in P vs. C. The number of DEPs of promoters with upor down-methylation within each comparison was shown in Fig. 1 . There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between the counts of up-and down-methylation ICP (see Fig. 1D , E), while HCP (see Fig. 1B , C) and LCP (see Fig. 1F , G) showed heterogeneous methylation patterns. Most HCPs in PK15 cells extracellular treatment by PolyI:C alone were hypomethylated ('01' profile, see Fig. 1C , black bar) compared with those in untreated PK15 cells, account for 52% of the three kinds of down-regulated methylation profiles ('01', '10' and '11'were of 149, 70 and 67 DEPs, respectively). LCPs were hyperrmethylated ('01' profile, see Fig. 1F , black bar) in P vs. C, account for 78% of three upregulated methylation profiles ('01', '10' and '11'were of 7, 0 and 2 DEPs, respectively). The data indicated that differential methylation of promoters in PolyI:C and Aza-CdR treated cells is enriched in specific regions relative to TSS and dependent on overall CpG density. Other differential comparisons also provided some relevant information, including (P + A) vs. P and (P + A) vs. A. (Fig. S1B ).",

In ten down-methylated biological processes (BPs, numbers of gene more than eight in each BP), the critical five in P vs. C include regulation of growth, protein modification process, developmental process, cellular component organization, multicellular organismal development. In (P + A) vs. C, the top five of nine down-methylated BPs were gene expression, embryo development, G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle, response to virus, reproduction of translational initiation. In A vs. C, just 2/17 BPs were down-methylation, containing cellular process involved in reproduction and response to virus. Up-methylated genes mainly enriched in induction of apoptosis by extracellular signals, metamorphosis and cell projection assembly and regulation of Rho protein signal transduction (see Fig. 3 , Table S2 and S4, red bars: up-methylated genes, blue bars: down-methylated genes). These data indicated that the effects of Aza-CdR on gene expression in PK15 cells were largely independent of cell growth and cellular morphology.

We found that the promoter regions of pseudogenes showed hypermethylation causing transcriptional repression. The DNA methylation level of retrotransposon genes was hypomethylated in the control cells (see Fig. 4 , control), nevertheless after treated with PolyI:C followed by the addition of Aza-CdR, the retrotransposon was up-methylated (see Fig. 4 , PolyI:C + Aza-CdR) in PK15 cells. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERV) represents a potential marker or mediator of environmental exposures (e.g., virus infection) in the development of chronic complex diseases. ERVWE1 is so far the only verified HERV proviral locus that has retained a long env ORF. Hypermethylation of ERVWE1 observed in non-placental cells has been linked with transcriptional repression [14] .

The indirect effects on gene expression we observed were also remarkably consistent across dosage and duration of both drugs exposure, and were largely independent of cells growth and morphology.

By means of the treatment of virus mimics and chemical genomic screening for epigenetic modification, MeDIP-chip and transcriptional microarray are costeffective methods to identify methylation targeted regions and genes [22, 23] . Combined methylation alteration regions with gene expression information can dissect the functional-related gene involved in virus replication and anti viral responses. Promoter methylation variation was observed in CDK9 gene which is enriched in the GO term of response to virus, as well as in ZC3HAV1 and BNIP3L genes that are involved in defense response to virus in P vs. C and (P + A) vs. C. Of which, CDK9 gene encodes cyclin-dependent kinase 9 and is a positive transcriptional elongation factor for the virus-encoded Tat protein activity [24, 25] . Cyclin T1/CDK9 interacts with influenza A virus polymerase to inhibit virus transcription and replication [26] . Its character of down-methylation while up-expression in PolyI:C or PolyI:C plus Aza-CdR treated cells could serve as biomarker for virus replication in the swine cells. BNIP3L gene (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19kD-interacting protein 3-like) can function as virus-induced tumor repressor, which encodes a homologue of NIP3, a protein that interacts with adenovirus E1B19kD protein and host BCL2 protein [27, 28] . The mRNA of the proapoptotic gene BNIP3L was significantly decreased following murine coronavirus (a signal strand RNA) infection, evades host antiviral defense and promotes cell survival [29] . Its down-methylation while very significant up-expression in PolyI:C plus Aza-CdR treated cells (Fig. S3A and Table S5 ) means BNIP3L could be a powerful candidate gene of anti virus infection. ZC3HAV1 is an interferon-inducible genes and encodes zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) [30] . Through binding to the viral RNA and recruiting the processing exosome, human ZAP causes the degradation of viral RNA [31] . Although the expression of ZC3HAV1 was up-regulated by PolyI:C or Aza-CdR alone (Fig. S3D) , its up-methylation but down-expression in PolyI:C plus Aza-CdR treated cells (blue bar in Fig. S3D ) suggest that the anti viral function of ZAP in PK15 cells can be induced by dsRNA or methyltransferase inhibitor but cannot be improved by both.",

TRMT6 is part of a two component methyltransferase in yeast, which is involved in the post-translational modification and produces the modified nucleoside 1-methyladenosine in tRNAs [34] . In human, modified nucleoside 1methyladenosine causes initiator methionine stability and may be involved in the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 [35, 36] . The up-expression of tRNA methyltransferase may cause hypermethylation of tRNA. RNA virus usually encode proteins to encounter the dsRNA-induced cellular defense. Cell nucleolin is a central hub for the replication of pathogenic RNA viruses. Previous study suggests that non-structural 1 protein (NS1) of influenza A (H3N2) could induce nucleolar stress based on epigenetic alteration of rRNA gene promoter via interaction with nucleolin [37] . In A vs. C comparison, promoter methylation of LOC100511875 has been linked with maturation of 5.8S rRNA and defense response to virus. Moreover, porcine retroviral oncogene MYB was down-methylated and activated in dsRNA treated PK15 cells. MYB encodes nuclear DNA-binding proteins and is involved in G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle [36] . The activation of oncogene MYB in PolyI:C treated cells means it could be a biomarker of dsRNA treatment. Retroviruses can selectively trigger an array of innate immune responses through various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), ZC3HAV1 was decreased two to eight folds that examined whether avian leukosis virus induces or inhibits innate immune host responses [38] , the results resembled to our study.",

These results suggest minor methylation variation in PERV 5\u2032LTR in PK15. Nevertheless, PK15 is possible contaminated with non-pathogenic porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) [40] . These potential viral sources could alter cellular promoter methylation/demethylation response against PolyI:C extracellular treatment.

The experiment was focusing on the extracellular PolyI:C stimulation rather than transfected PolyI:C. With regard to dsRNAs, TLR3, RIG-1 and MDA-5 pathways were different each other, thus there could be difference between the treatment of extracellular PolyI:C and transfected PolyI:C [45, 46] .
