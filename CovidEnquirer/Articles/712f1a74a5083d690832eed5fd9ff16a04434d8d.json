The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses.

This is important since it may not be feasible to collect serum from all patients, especially patients who are critically sick, dehydrated, the elderly, children, and neonates. Personnel trained in collecting blood specimens may also not be available, Furthermore, biological samples may contain chemicals that can inhibit nucleic acid assays if the sample is tested directly without first isolating the RNA. RT-LAMP worked in all the human sample types tested, and in samples from several individuals. We previously demonstrated that RT-LAMP for ZIKV does not require prior RNA isolation from the samples. 4, 5 Thus, we used unprocessed urine or serum samples in this study, which saves considerable time and reduced costs. In this RT-LAMP assay for COVID-19, the urine samples gave stronger RT-LAMP signals than the serum samples when spiked with identical amounts of COVID-19; however the amount of virus present in an infected individual will likely vary between different biological specimens and over the time course of the infection. Furthermore, we observed faint background banding by gel electrophoresis in oropharyngeal swabs, suggesting there may be some factor in this specimen that results in this. However, due to the specificity of the primers, we believe this does not interfere with correct interpretation of the RT-LAMP reaction, especially since the COVID-19 spiked sample can be correctly identified through color change and fluorescence .

Given that all the isolated strains of COVID-19 thus far have shown very little genetic differences, we anticipate that this RT-LAMP will detect COVID-19 with the same level of confidence as qRT-PCR. This COVID-19 RT-LAMP assay was highly specific as it did not give a positive result for MERS, BtCoV, and MHV and had significant mismatch with numerous strains of SARS and common cold associated human coronoavirus strains 229E, NL63, HKU1, or OC43. We tested a range of temperatures from 57\u00b0C to 65\u00b0C; all the temperatures gave comparable results, indicating that this RT-LAMP reaction has a large temperature range with an optimal temperate of 63 \u00b0 C . We also tested a range of incubation times from 15-45 minutes. The optimal time for detection of RT-LAMP products was 30 minutes, however COVID-19 RT-LAMP products were detectable by UV light excitation or banding patterns on gels in as little as 15 minutes.",

As such, all the experiments presented here used a nucleotide oligo of COVID-19 corresponding to the GenBank MN908947 sequence. Similarly, we were unable to directly test related coronaviruses and instead used nucleotide oligos from the same region of those viruses. However, these do represent a proof-of-feasibility for this assay, and the primers were further evaluated for specificity by BLASTing them to related coronavirus sequences. Although RT-LAMP reactions are highly specific, it is not a quantitative test. However other groups are working at improving the read outs of RT-LAMP assays including the use of smartphone-integrated sensors to make interpretation of the assay even more user-friendly. 8 RT-LAMP reactions can have a higher rate of false positives compared to qRT-PCR; we did not experience this in any of our no template negative control reactions, negative control samples, or other samples containing other coronaviruses.

Analysis and imaging took place in separate rooms to prevent contamination.

Addition of the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) reduced crossover contamination from previous reactions. Reactions were set-up on ice, incubated at 63\u00b0C for 30 minutes(15-45 minutes have been tested), and then inactivated at 80\u00b0C for 10 minutes. In order to optimize visualization of positive reactions, 2 \u03bc L SYBR Green I was added to reactions at a 1:10 dilution. All experiments were replicated 3-5 times. qRT-PCR: For testing, a 1:5 serial dilution of COVID-19 ssDNA control fragment was made, from 2 ng to 0.204 fg. Nuclease-free ddH 2 O was used as a no template control. No template control or COVID-19 was added to SYBRSelect Master Mix (ThermoFisher), and 10 \u00b5M forward and reverse primers with a total reaction volume of 20 \u00b5L. Primers used were F 5'-ATTTGGTGCCACTTCTGCTGC -3' and R 5'-TCACTGCCGTCTTGTTGACCA -3'. Cycling conditions were 50 \u00b0C for 2 minutes and 95 \u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60 \u00b0C for 1 minute, performed on a QuantStudio 3 PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Analysis of RT-LAMP: 1:10 SYBR green I (Life Technologies) dilution was made in TAE buffer, then 2 \u03bc L of the SYBR dilution was added to the RT-LAMP reactions. The visual change of color (orange to yellow) was also used to identify positive amplifications. In addition, the SYBR green I PCR tubes were imaged under UV light in the BIO-RAD ChemiDoc XRS+ Imaging System as the reaction creates a fluorescent output. One half of the RT-LAMP reaction was electrophoresed along with Invitrogen Low DNA Mass Ladder on a 2 % agarose gel in 1x TAE buffer (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA) at 90 V for 90 minutes. Gels were imaged under UV light using the BIO-RAD ChemiDoc XRS+ Imaging System. Lanes containing a laddered banding pattern were qualified as a positive amplification. All rights reserved.
