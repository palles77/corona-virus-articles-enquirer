It is being built on shared values and a vision of a common destiny. As the Chinese President Xi Jinping said in September 2018, China hopes to create \"a road of peace, prosperity, openness, green development and innovation and a road that brings together different civilizations.\" [1] The expansion of infrastructure, trade relations, scientific collaboration and connectivity between countries, peoples and cultures could create unprecedented opportunities and synergies to strengthen health systems, eliminate major infectious diseases, and improve the health of hundreds of millions of people. Through its direct and indirect effects, the Belt and Road Initiative could set benefi ciary countries on a fi rm path toward the achievement of universal health coverage-a declared goal of most countries around the world.",
