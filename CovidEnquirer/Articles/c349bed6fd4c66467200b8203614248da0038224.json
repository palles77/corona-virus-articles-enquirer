We have designed and synthesized 34 peptide substrates and determined their hydrolysis activities. The conserved core sequence of the native cleavage site is optimized for high hydrolysis activity. Residues at position P4, P3, and P3 0 are critical for substrate recognition and binding, and increment of b-sheet conformation tendency is also helpful. A comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) model was constructed. Based on the mutation data and CoMFA model, a multiply mutated octapeptide S24 was designed for higher activity. The experimentally determined hydrolysis activity of S24 is the highest in all designed substrates and is close to that predicted by CoMFA. These results offer helpful information for the research on the mechanism of substrate recognition of coronavirus 3C-like proteinase.",

A novel form of coronavirus has been identified as the major cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a disease that was rapidly spreading from southern China to several countries in 2003 [1, 2] . Coronaviruses are members of positive-stranded RNA viruses featuring the largest viral RNA genomes up to date. The SARS coronavirus replicase gene encompasses two overlapping translation products, polyprotein 1a ($450 kDa) and 1ab ($750 kDa), which are conserved both in length and amino acid sequence to other coronavirus replicase proteins. Polyprotein 1a and 1ab are cleaved by the internally encoded 3C-like proteinase to release functional proteins necessary for virus replication. The SARS 3C-like proteinase is fully conserved among all released SARS coronavirus genome sequences and is highly homologous with other coronavirus 3C-like proteinases. Due to the functional importance of SARS 3C-like proteinase in the viral life cycle, it has been proposed to be a key target for structural based drug design against SARS [3] .",

The P1 position has a well-conserved Gln residue and P2 a hydrophobic one. Unlike other previously identified coronavirus 3C-like proteinases, which have Leu/Ile at position P2, SARS 3C-like proteinase also tolerates Phe, Val, and Met residues at P2 position. P1 0 position requires a small aliphatic residue, usually Ser or Ala. Conserved substrate selectivity among different coronavirus 3C-like proteinases is determined using an HPLC-based peptide cleavage assay by Hegyi and Ziebuhr [7] . This result indicates the possibility of both the development of universally applicable 3C-like proteinase assay and the design of broad-spectrum inhibitors blocking all coronavirus 3C-like proteinases. Coronavirus 3C-like proteinases share the chymotrypsin fold part and similar substrate specificities with the 3C proteinases from other viruses like rhinovirus, picornavirus [3, 8, 9] .",

All the 11 cleavage sites in SARS coronavirus have a conserved Gln at position P1; 8 of them have a Leu at P2; and 9 have Ala or Ser at P1 0 . Similar result has been reported in the sequence analysis of 77 cleavage sites of 3C-like proteinases in different coronaviruses [13] . In this study, mutation at these positions decreased the substrate activity significantly or completely abolished its activity. This indicates that the conserved core sequence reveals high hydrolytic activity.

It is notable that the relative reaction activity of mutated substrates decreases from 0.208, 0.046 to about 0.006 while the P2 residue is replaced by no-branched Met, b-phenyl-containing Phe or b-branched Ile and Val.

The possibility of conformational cooperation with its neighbors will explain the different activities of mutants at position P4 and P3.
