There are several different portals of entry that are used by different viruses (Fig. 5.1 and Table 5 .1). Most viruses interact with the cells of the host epithelium, the layers of cells that line the outside surface and inner cavities of the body. The epithelium acts as the main barrier between the outside world and the internal environment of the body. Mucosal epithelium, so named because the epithelium is covered in a protective layer of mucus, lines all the internal surfaces of the body, including the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract. The epithelium can be bypassed, however, when viruses are delivered to internal sites through penetration of the skin, as happens with an insect or animal bite, or through transplantation of a virally infected organ.",

Within the lungs, the two bronchi branch into smaller-diameter bronchioles that lead to an estimated 300 million alveoli (singular: alveolus), where gas exchange occurs (Fig. 5.2B ). Viruses contained in larger droplets are deposited in the upper respiratory tract, while smaller aerosolized particles or liquids are able to travel into the lower respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract epithelium contains abundant goblet cells that produce mucus, a thick fluid that traps inhaled particulate matter. The majority of the upper respiratory epithelium is lined with cilia, small hairlike structures that move together like oars to push the mucus and its trapped contents to the throat, where it is swallowed (Fig. 5.2C) . Each cell has about 300 cilia. In the lower respiratory tract, mucus-secreting goblet cells become less abundant, and ciliated cells are present at the beginning of the lower respiratory tract but are absent in the alveoli of the lungs. The flow of mucus in the upper and lower respiratory tract traps many viral particles, and antibodies (particularly of the IgA isotype) produced by immune system cells bind to virus particles, preventing them from interacting with the cells of the respiratory epithelium. Within the alveoli of the lung are found many alveolar macrophages, another kind of immune system cell that is specialized in phagocytosis, a type of receptor-mediated endocytosis that is used by macrophages to endocytose whole cells or pathogens that are then digested by lysosomes within the macrophage.",

The pharynx moves food via the swallowing reflex into the esophagus, which has several mucus-secreting glands. Muscle contractions by the esophagus move the food into the stomach, which contains numerous pits of cells, all of which produce mucus to protect the cells from the acidic gastric juices secreted by the stomach. From there, food moves to the small intestine, where the food finishes being digested and is absorbed. The small intestine is roughly 6 ft long and is composed of fingerlike projections called villi (singular: villus) that increase the surface area of the epithelium (Fig. 5.3B and C) . Moreover, the epithelial cells that form the villi have multiple hairlike microvilli at their apical (outermost) end, forming what looks like the teeth of a comb. Each cell of a villus has an estimated 3000 microvilli. Together, the total surface area of the small intestine is similar to that of a tennis court. This increases the area of contact for absorption of food, but some viruses also take advantage of this area of exposure for infection (Table 5 .1).",

The flow of food, water, and saliva provides a mechanical barrier to infection, and mucus produced by the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine provides a physical barrier to infection. Macrophages phagocytose virions, and antibodies neutralize virions to prevent their interaction with host cell receptors. Successful viruses must also be resistant to the low pH of stomach acid and the detergent qualities of bile, which is produced by the liver, stored by the gallbladder, and secreted into the small intestine. The membrane envelopes of most enveloped viruses are disintegrated by bile. Acid-labile viruses are unable to withstand the low pH of the stomach, while acid-resistant viruses contain capsid proteins that are not denatured by low pH (or their protein denaturation is reversible). Within the Picornaviridae family, rhinoviruses are acid labile, whereas poliovirus is acid resistant. Viruses can be transmitted via the gastrointestinal tract in several different ways. Viruses can be transmitted from mother to child in breast milk, either as free virions or within infected cells; HIV, cytomegalovirus, and West Nile virus are three such viruses. Other viruses enter via the fecaloral route, meaning that virions present in the feces of an infected individual gain entry into the oral cavity of another individual and are ingested. This is a common occurrence in nations without water treatment plants and has been one of the major roadblocks in eradicating polio from undeveloped nations. In developed countries, touching contaminated surfaces or ingesting food or water that has been contaminated can lead to infection. Norwalk virus, described in Chapter 1, \"The World of Viruses,\" is another virus that is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. It is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the United States, causing roughly 20 million cases of acute gastroenteritis (a sudden stomach illness with vomiting and diarrhea) each year, according to the CDC. Worldwide, acute gastroenteritis caused by viruses is a major cause of death, leading to 1.5 million deaths annually.",

Several viruses can be transmitted through blood, including hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, West Nile virus, and dengue virus. The blood supply is currently screened for many of these, and the current risk of receiving contaminated blood is very low (Table 5 .2). However, before tests were developed and screening was instituted, hepatitis B and C viruses contaminated the blood supply. In the early 1980s, when AIDS was reported, blood industry supporters underestimated the risk of HIV having entered the blood supply and were slow to take action. At the time, more than half of the 16,000 people in the United States with hemophilia, a genetic bleeding disease that requires blood plasma transfusions to transfer clotting factors, contracted HIV from contaminated plasma products. Similarly, it is estimated that over 20,000 people contracted HIV from contaminated blood before March 1985, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first test to detect HIV. Incidents like this one have proven valuable in emphasizing the importance of detecting new viruses in the blood supply. When transfusion-transmitted West Nile virus infections were reported in 2002, a test was rapidly developed and the blood industry began regular testing of donated blood for the virus.",

These tend to be nonspecific, mild symptoms that are not clinically indicative of the type of virus, such as malaise, muscle aches, or a low-grade fever. During this period, however, the virus is replicating quickly within the host. The illness period occurs when specific symptoms of the disease occur. At this point, the virus is multiplying to high levels and the immune system has been activated, but the response takes time. In immunocompetent hosts with functioning immune systems, infected cells will eventually be eliminated and the amount of virus within the host will decline. At this point, the symptoms of the disease subside as the host begins feeling better, having entered into the convalescent period. This period may last for days or months, depending upon the severity of the infection. Specific symptoms appear FIGURE 5.10 Stages of disease development. It takes time for symptoms to appear after a virus infects a host. This period is known as the incubation period. The prodromal period begins when nonspecific signs of illness appear. The appearance of infection-specific symptoms marks the beginning of the illness period. The convalescence period begins when specific symptoms subside. The period of communicability is the range in which a person is infectious and can transmit the virus to a new host. This may include before symptoms appear or after they have subsided. The duration of each period of disease can vary depending upon the virulence of the pathogen, the site of infection, and the strength of the host immune system. The period of communicability, when a person is contagious and able to spread the virus to new hosts through virion shedding, will also vary depending upon the virus and can even include part of the incubation period, when symptoms are not yet present, all the way into convalescence (Table 5 .4). For example, influenza is contagious from 1 day before symptoms arise until about a week after becoming sick. Ebola virus is communicable in breast milk and semen for weeks to months during the convalescent period.",

Viral proteins can modulate the immune response, and certain viruses, including HIV, infect immune cells and interfere with their proper functioning. Persistent infections can also result from the production of defective interfering (DI) particles. DI particles are virions that are created during the replication process but contain incomplete or deleted genomes. Although these are defective, they are still released from the cell and act as a sponge to sequester antibodies. Although the mechanism is unknown, they also interfere with the apoptosis of infected cells, which can lead to a persistent state. The production of DI particles is more common in RNA viruses. Finally, certain organs of the body, including the brain, have highly controlled mechanisms to safeguard against cellular damage caused by inflammation. Viral infection of these tissues may lead to persistent infections due to the protection of these cells against apoptosis.",

Instead, it becomes latent in the sensory neurons of the individual. Although the genome persists in the neurons, new virions are not made, and a separate latency gene program is expressed. The virus is largely undetected by the immune system during latency. Later in life, reactivation from latency may occur, at which point the virus switches on a productive infectious cycle.

Indirect transmission, on the other hand, requires the presence of an intermediary between hosts. In comparison to droplet spread, which passes directly from one person to another, airborne transmission of viruses carried by dust or aerosolized particles that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time are considered indirect modes of transmission (see Section 5.3 for a review of droplets vs aerosolized particles). Vehicles refer to nonliving physical substances-such as food, water, blood, or inanimate objects (fomites)-that can indirectly transmit virions. Vectors are living intermediaries that can also transmit viruses. Mosquitos, fleas, and ticks are examples of vectors.

In contrast, the incidence of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, such as West Nile virus or eastern equine encephalitis virus, is higher at the end of the summer when mosquito populations are highest. Other viral infections show no association with season or time of year, such as hepatitis B virus, HIV, or HPV. Determining the typical yearly or seasonal pattern of viral infections is important in creating a baseline that can be used to compare future occurrence of the disease or monitor the effectiveness of control measures.

An example of a cohort study would be to observe consistent users of hookah pipes, a water pipe used to smoke flavored tobacco. One cohort of participants uses individual disposable plastic mouthpieces on their pipes, while the other group uses the attached metal mouthpiece. This study might observe whether HSV-1 transmission is more common in those using the metal, shared mouthpieces compared to those who each have their own disposable plastic mouthpiece.

An example of a case-control study would involve the infection of several people with hepatitis C virus at a tattoo parlor. After noting that all the case patients received their tattoos from one tattoo artist, epidemiologists retroactively enrolled a group of people that received tattoos from the other tattoo artist at the parlor. The control group allows them to have a baseline group to determine the typical infection rate. In this case, it was determined that one of the tattoo artists, but not the other, was improperly sterilizing tattoo equipment.",

Although the obvious conclusion seems to be that the liver scarring must be caused by the virus, it is also possible that the scarring makes the liver more susceptible to hepatitis C infection, and that is why these individuals have high rates of both liver scarring and hepatitis C. Because the study compares individuals at only one point in time, cause and effect (causation-the how/why) are difficult to determine. Correlation does not equal causation!
