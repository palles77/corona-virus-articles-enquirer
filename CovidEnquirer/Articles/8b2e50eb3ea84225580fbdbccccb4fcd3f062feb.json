The data 89 used in this study include the number of confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, the cumulative 90 number of suspected, dead, and cured cases. All cases were laboratory confirmed 91 following the case definition by national health commission of China (from CCDC 92 website). The basic test procedure has been described in detail in previous work 93 (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020) . We only chose the cases that are tested positive 94 by real-time RT-PCR with specific primers and probes to SARS-CoV-2 both at the 95 corresponding provincial CDC and the National Institute for Viral Disease Control at 96 CCDC. We assumed that the population of each region was susceptible to COVID-19, the 105 number of susceptible people per unit time was proportional to the number of 106 uninfected persons, and isolation or closure of the city could affect the spread effect of 107 infected to susceptible people to a certain extent. Previous studies have showed that 108 daily cumulative number of patients could be explained by logistic function (Huang et 109 al., 2003; Wang et al., 2003) . Based on the above assumption and previous studies, we 110 modeled the epidemic information of virus as logistic form (Eq. (1)) 111 .

Fitted curves of 171 provinces such as Jilin and Qinghai has larger value of k, which means that the 172 number of infections peaked earlier in these regions than in other provinces.

We found the variability of k values among 260 fitted curves of infected COVID-19 cases in 30 provinces (Fig 2 AB) is large 261 (Ranging from 0.19 to 0.38). It is clear to show the real situation in each province and 262 this guides us to be more careful against the epidemic. Further we compared this 263 characteristics between COVID-19 and SARS in 2003 in typical provinces (Fig 3 AB). 264 We noted that k values of fitted COVID-19 infection curves in 30 provinces of 265 mainland China (exclude Tibet) are larger than that of SARS in Beijing 2003 (Fig 3 266 C), which suggests the time cost of this epidemic will be shorter compared with 267 SARS in 2003. This result may related to several aspects. Firstly, it may due to the 268 basic spread property of the virus. Besides, the isolation policy of all the provinces in 269 mainland China was more strictly enforced than it was in 2003. Moreover, the 270 improved clinical skills today may also helpful for shortening the duration of 271 epidemic. 272 273 Furthermore, we analyzed semi-saturation period (Fig 4 EK) (t 0 in Eq. (8)) and make 274 comparison in three types of cases (infection, death and recovery) (Fig 4 A-C G-I). 275 Our model could fit them very well (R-square \u2265 ( \u2212 ). k values for the fitted 276 curves of the three types of cases caused by COVID-19 were larger than that of SARS, 277 while t 0 values were the opposite.
