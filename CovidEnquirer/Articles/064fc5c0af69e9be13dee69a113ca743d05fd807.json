To solve this problem, we constructed a ternary platinum nanoparticle, reduced graphene oxide, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs) nanocomposite via a facile one-pot synthetic method. Under the optimized conditions, the ternary Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite exhibited good electrocatalytic activity toward myricetin and rutin via solid phase extraction and excellent performance for the simultaneous determination of myricetin and rutin. The oxidation peak current of myricetin was proportional to its concentrations in the range of 0.05e50 mM with a detection limit of 0.01 mM (S/N \u00bc 3). The linear range for rutin was 0.05e50 mM with a detection limit of 0.005 mM (S/N \u00bc 3). The ternary nanocomposite sensor also exhibited good reproducibility and stability, and was successfully used for the simultaneous determination of myricetin and rutin in real orange juice samples with recoveries ranging between 100.57% and 108.46%.",

These methods can sensitively detect myricetin and rutin, but they have many drawbacks including the need for expensive equipment and time-consuming experimental processes, which constrain their practical application [9e18] . Compared to previously developed methods, voltammetry provides a fast response, uses simple equipment, and is highly sensitive to the determination of myricetin or rutin [19e28] . Although many electrochemical sensors have been reported for single determinations of myricetin or rutin [29e35], their simultaneous determination has seldom been reported due to their analogous chemical structures and electrochemical characteristics, resulting in an indistinguishable potential [36, 37] . Therefore, it is imperative to develop an electrochemical sensor that can realize the simultaneous determination of myricetin and rutin.",

Ltd. Shanghai, China). A threeelectrode system consisting of a bare or modified GCE (3 mm in diameter) working electrode, platinum wire counter electrode, and saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) was used. DPV scans from \u00c00.1e0.8 V with an amplitude of 0.05 V, pulse width of 0.05 s, pulse period of 0.5 s, and increment of 0.004 V were performed. For CV, scan rate was 50 mV/s and sample interval was 0.001 V. EIS was obtained in a 5.0 mmol/dm 3 6 ] solution containing 0.1 M KCl under an open circuit potential at a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and 5 mV amplitude. The surface morphology was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Zeiss Ultra 55, Germany) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Fig. 1 shows the SEM images at low and high magnifications of the ternary Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposites. The MWCNTs and r-GO were clearly observed, and the Pt NPs were uniformly and densely distributed in the MWCNTs and r-GO. The Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs composite was also analyzed by EDS (Fig. 2) , showing that the main components were C, O and Pt at approximately 85.27, 12.5, and 2.23 wt%, respectively (Si was also observed because the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite was dropped onto the silicon wafer for SEM sample preparation). The above results indicate the successful fabrication of the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite. After modification with the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite (curve b), the redox peak currents increased and a larger background current was observed due to the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite dramatically increasing the electrode surface area and exhibiting good electrical conductivity [41, 42] . Fig. 3B shows the EIS plots of the bare GCE and Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE. The bare GCE (curve a) exhibited a small resistance, but when the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite GCE was used (curve b), it displayed a significantly smaller resistance. Therefore, the CV and EIS diagrams further demonstrate the successful preparation of the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE sensor.",

Unlike the bare GCE, two pairs of redox peaks of myricetin and rutin were clearly observed when the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE was used along with a larger background current. Thus, the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite showed a good electrocatalytic effect for detection of both myricetin and rutin. In addition, the DPV results shown in Fig. 4B for the bare GCE (I pa \u00bc 4.617 mA, E pa \u00bc 0.276 V for myricetin, and I pa \u00bc 1.316 mA, E pa \u00bc 0.432 V for rutin) provided very small current signals. Moreover, the potential differences were insufficient to realize the simultaneous determination of myricetin I pa \u00bc 44.45 mA, E pa \u00bc 0.320 V for myricetin, and I pa \u00bc 51.71 mA, E pa \u00bc 0.496 V for rutin), the oxidation peak current signals increased by a factors of 11 and 50 for myricetin and rutin, respectively, over that of the bare GCE. In addition, the potential differences became large enough for the simultaneous detection of myricetin and rutin. Therefore, the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE sensor was successful used for the simultaneous determination of myricetin and rutin.",

As the pH increased (Fig. 6B) , oxidation peak currents of both myricetin and rutin increased until pH 3 and then decreased at higher pH values. Therefore, the optimum pH was determined to be 3. In Fig. 6C , as the pH increased, both oxidation peak potentials of myricetin and rutin negatively shifted with a good linear relationship between the oxidation peak potentials and pH. The linear equation for myricetin was E pa (V) \u00bc \u00c00.0702 pH \u00fe 0.5398 (R 2 \u00bc 0.9918) and for rutin E pa (V) \u00bc \u00c00.0632 pH \u00fe 0.6997 (R 2 \u00bc 0.9904). The slopes of the respective equations were 70.2 and 63.2 mV/pH, suggesting that both myricetin and rutin oxidation followed the Nernst equation requiring identical number of protons and electrons. Combined with previous reports [36, 37] , the myricetin and rutin oxidation mechanism involved the same number electron and proton transfer processes (Scheme 2).",

In concentration potential on the oxidation peak currents of myricetin and rutin using the optimized pre-concentration time. In Fig. 7B , the oxidation peak current increased until \u00c00.3 V, after which the oxidation peak currents gradually decreased. Therefore, the optimal pre-concentration potential for determination of myricetin and rutin was \u00c00.3 V. The simultaneous quantitative determination of myricetin and rutin at the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE was investigated via DPVs. From Fig. 8E , with an increase in concentration of myricetin and rutin, the corresponding oxidation peaks current gradually increased in intensity. Fig. 8F shows that the concentration of myricetin and oxidation peak current exhibited two linear detection ranges of 0.05e10 and 10e50 mM with linear equations of I p (mA) \u00bc 2.0561C (mM) \u00fe 1.6368 (R 2 \u00bc 0.9958) and I p (mA) \u00bc 0.5643C (mM) \u00fe 17.2910 (R 2 \u00bc 0.9731), respectively.

The detection limits of myricetin and rutin were 10 and 5 nM (S/N \u00bc 3), respectively. These results indicated that the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite modified electrode showed higher sensitivity and selectivity for both myricetin and rutin. Moreover, compared to other reported determinations of myricetin or rutin, our Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE can realize the simultaneous determination of myricetin and rutin with lower detection limits and the wider linear ranges (Table 1) [16,36,37,56e59] . The electrode modified with the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs nanocomposite showed improved detection sensitivity due to the pre-concentration ability and solid-phase extraction.",

These results indicate that the modified electrode exhibited good selectivity for the determination of myricetin and rutin. Furthermore, three modified electrodes were stored under refrigerated conditions (4 C) and used regularly for myricetin and rutin analysis at 10-day intervals. After 30 days of storage, the sensor response remained quite stable (the reduction of the sensor output signal was \u02c25%), demonstrating the excellent stability of Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE. The reversibility of the Pt@r-GO@MWCNTs/GCE electrode was investigated by DPVs. We modified an electrode that was stored under refrigerated conditions and subsequently used for myricetin and rutin analysis at 8 h intervals for two days.

The oxidation peak current and concentration showed two linear detection ranges of 0.05e10 and 10e50 mM (Fig. 8D) with linear equations of I p (mA) \u00bc 2.6258C (mM) \u00fe 3.1559 (R 2 \u00bc 0.9900) and I p (mA) \u00bc 0.6131C (mM) \u00fe 22.6930 (R 2 \u00bc 0.9977), respectively.",
