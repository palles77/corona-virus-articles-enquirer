The global population is ageing as a combined result of the demographic transition from high to low levels of fertility and mortality. 1 Population ageing increases the total global disease burden, with approximately 23% attributable to disorders in people aged \u226560 years. 2 Chronic non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease, malignant neoplasms, and chronic respiratory diseases, are the leading contributors to disease burden in older people. 2 However, infectious diseases also considerably affect older people, as an increasing incidence of infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis, was shown from recent surveillance data. [3] [4] [5] This large disease burden in older people calls for improvements in the healthcare system and more investments and programs focusing on healthy ageing. 2 Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, is a chronic infection with diverse clinical manifestations occurring in distinct stages, and may lead to blindness, dementia, delirium, death, etc., if not treated immediately or adequately. 6 Syphilis can also aid the passage for HIV to invade, reduce the CD4 T-cell levels, and increase the viral load, thereby aggravating the harm of HIV. 7 Even though syphilis can be effectively treated by penicillin, about 36.4 million new cases occur annually. 8 In China, the syphilis epidemic has rapidly increased, with 16.3% increase per year during the first decade after the SARS outbreak. 9 The reported incidence was slightly higher among females than males (ratio, 1.00 to 0.92), but it varied significantly with age. 5 The younger people (20-39 years) reported the highest syphilis incidence and accounted for the largest proportion of newly reported cases; however, the older age groups (\u226545 years) had the fastest growth in incidence, and males aged \u226560 years displayed a peak incidence of latent syphilis in the last decade. 5 With the accelerated ageing of the global population, the increasing syphilis epidemic among older adults is alarming.",

Line graphs were used to describe the change in prevalence for both syphilis infection and active infection among the age groups after stratification of gender and year of donation. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were calculated when comparing the risk of syphilis infection and active infection between the \u2265 45 years age group and other age groups.

[3] [4] [5] This large disease burden among older people calls for improvements in the healthcare system and more investments and programs focusing on healthy ageing. 2 Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, is a chronic infection with diverse clinical manifestations occurring in distinct stages, and may lead to blindness, dementia, delirium, death, etc., if not treated immediately or adequately. 6 Syphilis can also aid the passage for HIV to invade, reduce the CD4 T-cell levels, and increase the viral load, thereby aggravating the harm caused by HIV. 7 Even though syphilis can be effectively treated with penicillin, about 36.4 million new cases occur annually. 8 In China, the syphilis epidemic has rapidly increased, with 16.3% increase per year during the first decade after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. 9 The reported incidence was slightly higher among females than males (ratio, 1.00 to 0.92), but it varied significantly with age. 5 Younger people (aged 20-39 years) reported the highest syphilis incidence and accounted for the largest proportion of newly reported cases; however, the older age groups (aged \u226545 years) had the fastest growth in incidence, and males aged \u226560 years displayed a peak incidence of latent syphilis in the last decade. 5 With the accelerated ageing of the global population, the increasing syphilis epidemic among older adults is alarming. Shenzhen, a special economic zone located in southern China and with a population of >10 million, is one of the cities that most affected by syphilis. The reported incidence of syphilis was over 60 per 100 000 in last 10 years, which was much higher than the national incidence. 5,10 Consistent with the aforementioned characteristics of varied age groups, a rapid increase in syphilis incidence was observed among older adults in Shenzhen. 11 Studies usually considered blood donors as a representative of the general population and used the prevalence data of blood donors for real-time surveillance and identification of high-risk groups. 12 Whether the syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors agrees with reported incidence characteristics remains to be studied. Shenzhen follow-up, for syphilis-infected adults. 13 Based on the data from the SPSPC, this study aimed to examine differences in syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors and describe the distribution of serological titres among syphilis-infected donors with respect to age groups, to confirm the syphilis epidemic characteristics in southern China and support the design of effective interventions for older adults.",

The proportion of high-titre Evidence suggests that the most significant factor affecting testing patterns in older adults is providing the screening test actively. 29 Since the initiation of China's national syphilis control plan, syphilis screening has been widely integrated into HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services. More than 95% of people who received HIV testing services have undergone free syphilis testing. 30 Referral, treatment, and follow-up services would be provided to those diagnosed with syphilis. In Shenzhen, more than half of VCT sites are set in community health service centres, where a separate room is arranged for counselling and testing service. However, due to the low awareness of self-testing, older adults rarely positively seek the services. Meanwhile, most health staff are unwilling to provide the service actively because of limited experience, lack of time, discomfort in discussing sexual behaviours and STDs with older adults, stigma, ageism, etc. 28 Hence, enhanced training of healthcare providers and education of older adults are necessary.",

[3] [4] [5] This large disease burden among older people calls for improvements in the healthcare system and more investments and programs focusing on healthy ageing. 2 Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, is a chronic infection with diverse clinical manifestations occurring in distinct stages, and may lead to blindness, dementia, delirium, death, etc., if not treated immediately or adequately. 6 Syphilis can also aid the passage for HIV to invade, reduce the CD4 T-cell levels, and increase the viral load, thereby aggravating the harm caused by HIV. 7 Even though syphilis can be effectively treated with penicillin, about 36.4 million new cases occur annually. 8 In China, the syphilis epidemic has rapidly increased, with a 16.3% increase per year during the first decade after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. 9 The reported incidence was slightly higher among females than males (ratio, 1.00 to 0.92), but it varied significantly with age. 5 Younger people (aged 20-39 years) reported the highest syphilis incidence and accounted for the largest proportion of newly reported cases; however, the older age groups (aged \u226545 years) had the fastest growth in incidence, and males aged \u226560 years displayed a peak incidence of latent syphilis in the last decade. 5 With the accelerated ageing of the global population, the increasing syphilis epidemic among older adults is alarming. of >10 million, is one of the cities that most affected by syphilis. The reported incidence of syphilis was over 60 per 100 000 in last 10 years, which was much higher than the national incidence. 5,10 Consistent with the aforementioned characteristics of varied age groups, a rapid increase in syphilis incidence among older adults was observed in Shenzhen. 11 Studies usually considered blood donors as a representative of the general population and used the prevalence data of blood donors for real-time surveillance and identification of high-risk groups. 12 Whether the syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors agrees with reported incidence characteristics remains to be studied. Shenzhen launched a comprehensive program, the Shenzhen Program for Syphilis Prevention and Control (SPSPC), in November 2013 to enhance syphilis screening among blood donors and five other subgroups (HIV voluntary counsellors, methadone maintenance treatment users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and women of childbearing age), as well as case management, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, for syphilis-infected adults. 13 Based on the data from the SPSPC, this study aimed to examine differences in syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors and describe the distribution of serological titres among syphilis-infected donors with respect to age groups, to confirm the syphilis epidemic characteristics in southern China and support the design of effective interventions for older adults. Before donation, all potential donors needed to complete a health history questionnaire, sign a donation registration form, and undergo rapid testing and a brief physical examination. The health history questionnaire contained a total of 27 medical conditions that would permanently or temporarily prevent the donors from ",

A previous study has found that the syphilis prevalence among husbands of 2261 syphilis-infected pregnant women was < 30%. 33 Premarital or extramarital sexual partners may greatly increase the risk of syphilis infection among females. Additionally, serological response differs between males and females. 34 Females are more likely to be serofast [defined as remaining positive in a non-treponemal test and keeping the titre at a certain level (mostly 1:8 or below) after recommended therapy and follow-up 1 to 3 years according to syphilis stage] when comparing with males, 35 leading to more females staying in the state of active infection. The exact mechanism underlying this difference is unclear, but it may be partly associated with the varied immune system between both sexes. 34 Furthermore, men who have sex with men are considered a major high-risk subgroup for syphilis infection and are permanently deferred from blood donation in",

[3] [4] [5] This large disease burden among older people calls for improvements in the healthcare system and more investments and programs focusing on healthy ageing. 2 Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, is a chronic infection with diverse clinical manifestations occurring in distinct stages, and may lead to blindness, dementia, delirium, death, etc., if not treated immediately or adequately. 6 Syphilis can also aid the passage for HIV to invade, reduce the CD4 T-cell levels, and increase the viral load, thereby aggravating the harm caused by HIV. 7 Even though syphilis can be effectively treated with penicillin, about 36.4 million new cases occur annually. 8 In China, the syphilis epidemic has rapidly increased, with a 16.3% increase per year during the first decade after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. 9 The reported incidence was slightly higher among females than males (ratio, 1.00 to 0.92), but it varied significantly with age. 5 Younger people (aged 20-39 years) reported the highest syphilis incidence and accounted for the largest proportion of newly reported cases; however, the older age groups (aged \u226545 years) had the fastest growth in incidence, and males aged \u226560 years displayed a peak incidence of latent syphilis in the last decade. 5 With the accelerated ageing of the global population, the increasing syphilis epidemic among older adults is alarming.",

The reported incidence of syphilis was over 60 per 100 000 in last 10 years, which was much higher than the national incidence. 5, 10 Consistent with the aforementioned characteristics of varied age groups, a rapid increase in syphilis incidence among older adults was observed in Shenzhen. 11 Studies usually considered blood donors as a representative of the general population and used the prevalence data of blood donors for real-time surveillance and identification of high-risk groups. 12 Whether the syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors agrees with reported incidence characteristics remains to be studied. Shenzhen launched a comprehensive program, the Shenzhen Program for Syphilis Prevention and Control (SPSPC), in November 2013 to enhance syphilis screening among blood donors and five other subgroups (HIV voluntary counsellors, methadone maintenance treatment users, female sex workers, men who have sex with men, and women of childbearing age), as well as case management, including diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up, for syphilis-infected adults. 13 Based on the data from the SPSPC, this study aimed to examine differences in syphilis seroprevalence among blood donors and describe the distribution of serological titres among syphilis-infected donors with respect to age groups, to confirm the syphilis epidemic characteristics in southern China and support the design of effective interventions for older adults. Before donation, all potential donors needed to sign a donation registration form, complete a health history questionnaire, and undergo rapid testing and a brief physical examination.

There were four age groups, <25 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, and \u226545 years, fully considering the age coverage of blood donors and age classification in previous studies. 15, 16 We calculated the crude prevalence and its 95% confidence interval (CI). The chi-squared (\u03c7 2 ) test for trend was used to assess the difference in prevalence among age groups. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs were calculated when comparing the risk of syphilis seropositivity and active infection between the \u2265 45 years age group and other age groups. Line graphs were used to describe the changes in prevalence for both syphilis seropositivity and active infection among the age groups after stratification by gender and year of donation. Furthermore, we described the distribution of TRUST titres among the age groups and compared the difference using the \u03c7 2 test for trend.

First, limited financial and human resources restricted us in using a population-based design, which is considered as the gold standard in evaluating disease epidemics. 12 The choice of blood donors as population samples may result in potential bias, such as selection bias for age coverage and self-identified health conditions. Second, the syphilis seroprevalence among first-time donors was significantly higher than that among repeat donors. 12, 15 This study did not collect the information of first-time donors and repeat donors, which may lead to underestimation of syphilis seroprevalence. Third, false-negative results attributable to the window period of syphilis infection may result in an underestimation of syphilis seroprevalence. However, the residual risk of syphilis infection is very low according to a residual risk analysis conducted in Shenzhen. 37",

Results: Among 394 792 blood donors, 733 tested TPPA and TRUST positive (active infection), and 728 tested only TPPA positive (historical infection). The overall prevalence of syphilis seropositivity was 370.1 per 100 000 [95% confidence interval (CI), 351.1-389.0 per 100 000]; the prevalence of active infection was 185.7 per 100 000 (95% CI, 172.2-199.1 per 100 000). People aged \u226545 years displayed a prevalence of 621.8 per 100 000 in syphilis seropositivity and 280.5 per 100 000 in active infection, which were 3.8 times and 2.4 times higher than that for people aged <25 years, respectively. The prevalence of syphilis seropositivity (\u03c7 2 trend = 311.9, p trend < 0.001) and active infection (\u03c7 2 trend = 72.1, p trend < 0.001) increased significantly with age. After stratification by gender and year of donation , the increasing trend of prevalence with age remained(p trend < 0.05), except for the prevalence of active infection in males and females in 2014.

Weight, blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature were measured. Clinical examination of the skin and limbs was conducted. People who conformed to the Whole Blood and Component Donor Selection Requirements (GB 18467-2001) could proceed to donate blood. All blood donors were non-remunerated. Light refreshment, a blood donation certification, and a blood credit allowing free transfusion for donors or their direct relatives were provided as incentives. The donation process and blood management were fully in accordance with the Blood Donation Law of the People's Republic of China and the Blood Donation Regulation of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.

Here, the proportion of high titres among active infection patients was similar to that reported in the United States.14    This study found that syphilis prevalence significantly increased with age. Older adults aged \u226545 years displayed the highest prevalence of both syphilis infection and health awareness and syphilis prevention focusing on older adults are needed.The higher prevalence in older adults might be due to several reasons. First, many older people are sexually active,25  and their sexual health and behaviour affect syphilis transmission. Low self-perception of risk and misconceptions or limited knowledge about syphilis and other STDs were frequently reported as reasons for condomless behaviours among older adults.5,26  Second, older adults have been largely neglected by healthcare providers due to age-related stigma.27  Sexual health services for HIV or STDs rarely focus on older adults, leaving this group behind in both testing and prevention. Third, presenting with a late diagnosis has been significantly associated with older age. Older people were more likely to be aware of their serostatus when in hospital or an active offer of a testing.28  In this study, analysis of the TRUST titre distribution suggests that > 80% of people aged \u226545 years with low TRUST titres had a previous infection. However, late presentation is particularly worrying among older people because it further increases the risk of cardiovascular syphilis, neurosyphilis, paresis, etc. As syphilis is a great imitator, doctors often ignore syphilis infection when diagnosing the elderly, leading to omission of syphilis testing and misdiagnosis of the disease. syphilis control plan, syphilis screening has been widely integrated into HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services.

As is known, ELISA is a method used worldwide for syphilis screening, with a sensitivity of >98% and specificity of >99% according to the reagent evaluation.23 TPPA is considered as the gold standard test in syphilis diagnosis. Surprisingly, only 56.3% of ELISA-positive patients in this study were confirmed by TPPA, meaning the positive predictive value (the value associated with sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence) for ELISA was below 60%.

Active infection is different from historical infection as the former indicates more transmission and late syphilis if without timely and adequate treatment. The higher the serological titre, the more the risk of transmission (e.g., mother-to-child transmission) and adverse outcomes.24  This study documented that 50.2% (733/1461) of syphilis-infected donors had active infection patients, and 13.6% (198/1461) had a TRUST titre of \u22651\u22368. Here, the proportion of high titres among syphilis infection patients was similar to that reported in the United States.12    This study found that syphilis prevalence significantly increased with age. Older adults aged \u226545 years displayed the highest prevalence of both syphilis infection and active infection. More importantly, from the national surveillance data, people aged \u226560 years had a remarkably higher increase in reported incidence compared with those aged 45-60 years.5  Hospitalised patients aged \u226570 years showed the highest syphilis prevalence (4.8%), followed by patients aged 61-70 years (3.9%) and those aged 51-60 years (3.2%), which was much different from that for HIV infection for which patients aged 31-40 years recorded the highest prevalence.25  Based on the results of this study and previous studies, health awareness and syphilis prevention focusing on older adults are needed.The higher prevalence in older adults might be due to several reasons. First, many older people are sexually active,26  and their sexual health and behaviour affect syphilis transmission. Low self-perception of risk and misconceptions or limited knowledge about syphilis and other STDs were frequently reported as reasons for condomless sex among older adults.5,27  Second, older adults have been largely neglected by healthcare providers due to age-related stigma.28  Sexual health services for HIV or STDs rarely focus on older adults, leaving this group behind in both testing and prevention.

As is known, ELISA is a method used worldwide for syphilis screening, with a sensitivity of >98% and specificity of >99% according to the reagent evaluation.23 TPPA is considered as the gold standard test in syphilis diagnosis. Surprisingly, only 56.3% of ELISA-positive patients in this study were confirmed by TPPA, meaning the positive predictive value (the value associated with sensitivity, specificity and disease prevalence) for ELISA on syphilis was below 60% among blood donors. The testing process in this study greatly reduced the number of false positives and increased the accuracy of syphilis seroprevalence.To our knowledge, this study is the first in-depth study focusing on active infection and serological titre distribution of syphilis among blood donors in mainland China.The higher prevalence among older adults might be due to several reasons. First, many older people are sexually active,26  and their sexual health and behaviour affect syphilis transmission. Low self-perception of risk and misconceptions or limited knowledge about syphilis and other STDs were frequently reported as reasons for condomless sex among older adults.5,27  Second, older adults have been largely neglected by healthcare providers due to age-related stigma.28  Sexual health services for HIV or STDs rarely focus on older adults, leaving this group behind in both testing and prevention. Third, presenting with a late diagnosis has been significantly associated with older age. Older people were more likely to be aware of their serostatus when in hospital or had an active offer for testing.29 In this study, analysis of the TRUST results suggests that > 90% of syphilis-infected people aged \u226545 years with TRUST negative or with low titres had a previous infection. However, late presentation is particularly worrying among older people because it further increases the risk of cardiovascular syphilis, neurosyphilis, paresis, etc. As syphilis is a great imitator, doctors often ignore syphilis infection when diagnosing the elderly, leading to omission of syphilis testing and misdiagnosis of the disease.",

The higher the serological titre, the more the risk of transmission (e.g., mother-to-child transmission) and adverse outcomes.24  This study documented that 50.2% (733/1461) of syphilis seropositive donors had active infection, and 13.6% (198/1461) had a TRUST titre of \u22651\u22368. Here, the proportion of high titres among syphilis seropositive patients was similar to that reported in the United States.12    This study found that syphilis prevalence significantly increased with age. Older adults aged \u226545 years displayed the highest prevalence of both syphilis seropositivity and active infection. More importantly, from the national surveillance data, people aged \u226560 years had a remarkably higher increase in reported incidence compared with those aged 45-60 years.5  Hospitalised patients aged \u226570 years showed the highest syphilis prevalence (4.8%), followed by patients aged 61-70 years (3.9%) and those aged 51-60 years (3.2%), which was much different from that for HIV infection for which patients aged 31-40 years recorded the highest prevalence.25  Based on the results of this study and previous studies, health awareness and syphilis prevention focusing on older adults are needed.The higher prevalence among older adults might be due to several reasons. First, many older people are sexually active,26  and their sexual health and behaviour affect syphilis transmission.
