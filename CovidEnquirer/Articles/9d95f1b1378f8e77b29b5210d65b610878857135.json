Despite these advances, modern treatment options for FIP remain palliative and vaccines have proven either unsafe or ineffective (Pedersen, 2014b) . The emergence of SARS-associated coronavirus has provided an impetus for an investment in antiviral discovery focused on coronaviruses (De Clercq, 2004) . A 3C-like protease inhibitor (GC376) was first demonstrated to be highly effective against experimental FIPV infections (Kim et al., 2016) . A subsequent study on cats with naturally acquired FIP showed them to be much more difficult to treat (Pedersen et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, this was the first study demonstrating the potential for an antiviral compound to treat FIP in nature and 6 of 20 cats have remained disease free for well over one year after 12 weeks of treatment (Pedersen et al., 2017) .",

The active NTP analog functions as a competitor of the natural nucleoside triphosphates in viral RNA synthesis. The active form of GS-441524 has been shown to inhibit RSV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mediated transcription by incorporating into the nascent viral transcript and causing premature termination (Sheahan et al., 2017) .

The overall plasma pharmacokinetic profiles were similar between the subcutaneous and intravenous groups (Fig. 2D) , with area under the curve (AUC) over 24 h values of 38.9 and 43.8 uM*hL, respectively. The intracellular triphosphate concentration in PBMC appeared higher in cats administered GS-441524 by the SC route, but the differences were not significant due to sample variation and number (Fig. 2E) . The concentration of triphosphate in PBMC was sustained at 8-20 times higher than the levels of the prodrug (Fig. 2E) . This was also 8-20 times higher than the EC50 of 1uM calculated by two different methods from CRFK cultures (Figs. 1C and 2A).",

No acute toxicities were observed in laboratory cats after a single SC or IV injection of GS-441524. Subcutaneous or intravenous dosage at 5 mg/kg GS-441524 resulted in similar plasma profiles and the intracellular triphosphate levels were approximately 8-20 uM in feline PBMCs over a 24 h period. The occurrence of neurological and ocular disease in cats FIP (Pedersen 2014b) , and CNS complications in an earlier trial of a viral protease inhibitor (Pedersen et al., 2017) , was impetus for a supplementary PK experiment testing the ability of GS-441524 to pass the blood/eye and blood/brain barriers. A single SC dose of GS-441524 at 10 mg/kg resulted in intraocular and CNS drug levels of the parent GS-441524 that were near or above the effective 1 uM level. Whether this amount of GS-441524 entering eyes and brain can cure disease in these sites must await field testing, as it is extremely difficult to recreate and study ocular and neurologic diseases in the laboratory. GC376, a 3 C-like protease inhibitor, crossed the blood-to-brain barrier at a CSF/ plasma ratio comparative to GS-441524 (Kim et al., 2015) , but it was not effective against pre-existing neurological disease or in preventing eventual CNS involvement in a proportion of treated cats (Pedersen et al., 2017) .",

A dosage of 5 mg/kg of the parent drug sustained blood levels over 24 h in the PK study, which was 8-20 times higher than an EC50 of the calculated from cell culture experiments. Therefore, it was reasonable to postulate that 2 mg/kg would also be effective and conserve drug and reduce potential toxicity.

Relapses following protease inhibitor treatment (Pedersen et al., 2017) and experimental infection (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) have been observed and are most likely due to incomplete clearance of the infection and/or a failure to mount a protective immune response during infection. The ten treated cats have remained clinically normal to date (eight months post infection). No systemic signs of drug toxicity were noted in any of the cats over two-week, and two-week plus a second two-week, treatment periods.",

An earlier study with a novel 3 C-like protease inhibitor (GC376), which also underwent the same types of pre-testing (Pedersen et al., 2017) , has provided a template for such a field trial. Field testing of GC376 demonstrated that naturally occurring FIPV infection is more difficult to treat than natural infection, may require a somewhat higher dose, involves many more weeks of treatment, and the cure rate is apt to be lower. Although 19 of the 20 field cats treated with GC376 regained outward health within two weeks of treatment, only 6 cats have remained disease free after more than 18 months (Pedersen et al., 2017) .",
