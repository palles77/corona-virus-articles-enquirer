The mucins showed high inhibitory activity for H. pylori, which was significantly decreased after the removal of sialic acids from the mucins. The inhibitory potencies using high molecular mass mucin-like components from bovine milk were comparable with those obtained for gastric mucins, suggesting their possible role in the prevention of H. pylori infection. z",

            "text": "Gastrointestinal mucins, high molecular mass glycoproteins which are synthesised and secreted by mucus cells of the human stomach and intestine, show regional variations in composition and expres-sion. The terminal region of O-glycosidically linked carbohydrate chains consist of sialic acid, fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine in addition to galactose and N-acetylglucosamine [5] . An increase in sialylation has been demonstrated for mucosal cells infected with H. pylori [6] . A possible association between the occurrence of O-acetylated sialic acids in intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection has also been reported [7] . Controversial results on the role of sialic acids and sulfate for H. pylori binding to gastric mucins have been reported. For example, in one study the in\u00a3uence of sulfation of gastric mucins for H. pylori binding to gastric mucosa has been shown excluding the role of sialic acids in haemagglutination inhibition assays [8] . In contrast, H. pylori binding to human gastric mucin in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was demonstrated to be at least partly sialic acid-dependent [9] . Also for human salivary mucins the importance of both sialylated [10] and sulfated [10] components as receptor structures for H. pylori adhesion has been reported. In addition, the expression of di\u00a1erent binding characteristics depending on growth conditions of the bacteria has been demonstrated. For example, two di\u00a1erent sialic acid-binding adhesins were described for agarand broth-cultured bacteria with the speci\u00a2cities for sialylated glycoproteins and sialylated glycosylceramides [11] .",

Fat globule membranes (MFGM-1) were prepared from bovine buttermilk obtained from a butter-making plant of Snow Brand Milk Products Co. Ltd. To remove casein by coagulation, rennet treatment was done at pH 6.2. HR-rennet (0.003% w/v) (Christian Hansen, The Netherlands) was added under mild agitation and then incubated at 30\u00b3C for 27 min until most of the casein was coagulated to form curd. After cutting the curd the mixture was heated slowly for 40 min to a \u00a2nal temperature of 40\u00b3C and kept at this temperature for a further 60 min. Subsequently, the curd was separated from whey containing MFGM using a \u00a2lter cloth. Prepared whey solution was recirculated through a micro\u00a2lter membrane (Carbosep M-14; 0.14 Wm pore size, Techsep, France) to remove proteins and carbohydrates from the whey and to concentrate MFGM in the retentate. Dia\u00a2ltration was performed by concentrating the whey to 30% of its original volume then washing with water 4 times the volume of the retentate under the following operating conditions: \u00a3ow rate, 600 l min 3I ; trans-membrane pressure, 2 kg cm 3P ; temperature, 50\u00b3C, and lyophilised and used as MFGM-1.

The inhibitory activities of gastric mucins were a\u00a1ected by sialidase treatment indicating the importance of sialic acids of these mucins for the recognition by H. pylori sialic aciddependent strains. The residual inhibitory activities of the mucins after the removal of sialic acids could be explained by sulfate present in mucin preparations as binding sites for a corresponding adhesin of H. pylori.

In our studies, MFGM preparation showed a high inhibitory potency for H. pylori-induced haemagglutination. Furthermore, the lipid part of the preparation does not seem to be involved in the binding of bacteria, since delipidation did not change the inhibitory potency of the preparation. The results obtained with low molecular mass components from milk such as GMP with terminal K-2,3-linked Neu5Ac as well as with sialyl(K-2,3)-lactose showing an inhibitory e\u00a1ect against H. pylori at higher sialic acid concentrations compared to (Table 3) , and with free Neu5-Ac not a\u00a1ecting the haemagglutination, demonstrate the relevance of a mucin-like presentation of the glycans for a pronounced inhibitory e\u00a1ect. In our studies we demonstrate the importance of H. pylori sialic acid-binding haemagglutinin(s) for the interaction with gastric mucins, facilitating the spreading of the bacteria in the host by leading them to speci\u00a2c epithelial cell targets to attach and to cause tissue damage. This does not exclude other possible role(s) of sialic acid-speci\u00a2c binding of H. pylori in the colonisation process in the stomach. Furthermore, H. pylori binding to the extracellular matrix component laminin was recently shown to be sialic acid-dependent [27] . Also the importance of sialylated oligosaccharides on human gastric epithelial cells as binding sites for H. pylori has been described [28] . Since mucin-like high molecular mass components from milk showed high inhibitory potencies for H. pylori adhesion comparable to gastrointestinal mucin preparations, these could serve as potent anti-infectious components against H. pylori.",
