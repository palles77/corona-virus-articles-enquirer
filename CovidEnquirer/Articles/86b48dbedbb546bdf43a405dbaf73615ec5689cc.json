There remains a pressing need for additional pulmonary supportive care measures, especially techniques that do not require systemic anticoagulation. The objective of our experiments was to determine whether systemic oxygenation could be increased in a large animal, with induced hypoxia, by perfusing the abdominal cavity with oxygenated perfluorocarbons. Methods: Fifteen pigs with a mean (\u060e SD) weight of 45 \u060e 5 kg were intubated and rendered hypoxic by ventilating them with a blend of nitrogen and oxygen to achieve subatmospheric concentrations of inspired oxygen ranging from 18 to 10%, resulting in baseline mean PaO 2 range of 65.9 \u060e 9.7 to 26.6 \u060e 2.8 mm Hg, respectively. Peritoneal perfusion was performed in eight animals with oxygenated perfluorocarbon and in seven control animals with oxygenated saline solution.",

A common treatment effect was estimated across all fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) values, representing the average mean difference in oxygen uptake between oxygenated perfluorocarbon and saline solution, irrespective of the level of FIO 2 . This average was 12.8 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 7.4 to 18.2; p < 0.001). The most clinically relevant results occurred at an FIO 2 of 14%, resulting in a baseline mean PaO 2 of 39.4 \u060e 5.0 mm Hg with oxygenated saline solution perfusion, and a mean PaO 2 of 55.3 \u060e 7.6 mm Hg with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion. This corresponded to an increase in arterial oxygen saturation from 73 to 89%. Conclusion: These results of our principle experiments demonstrate that the peritoneal cavity can be used for gas exchange and, in our model, yielded clinically relevant increases in systemic arterial oxygen levels. This technique may have the potential for the supportive care of patients dying from hypoxia in the setting of reversible lung injury. (CHEST 2006; 130:402-411)",

            "text": "Supportive care with mechanical ventilation is the cornerstone of all treatment strategies for patients with severe pulmonary failure. Numerous modes and Original Research CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE parameters of mechanical ventilation can be adjusted in an effort to maximize gas exchange, but when these manipulations are no longer effective the clinician is left with very few options. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a well-established and effective technique to supplement pulmonary function. This modality, however, is a scarce resource that requires special expertise to institute and trained personnel to manage, and, primarily due to the need for systemic anticoagulation, is accompanied by its own set of morbidities and limitations. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Liquid ventilation, an attempt to improve the gas exchange capacity of diseased lungs by filling them with a gas-transporting fluid (perfluorocarbons), is an experimental modality that has yet to establish itself as a mainstream therapeutic option. 11, 12 Perfluorocarbons are inert, colorless, clear, nontoxic, fluorine-based organic compounds with extraordinary gas-dissolving properties. The solubility of O 2 and CO 2 in perfluorocarbons is typically in the range of 50 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid and 200 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid at 37\u00b0C, respectively. For comparison, the respective solubility of O 2 and CO 2 in saline solution at 37\u00b0C is 3 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid and 57 mL of gas per 100 mL of liquid. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] The concept we wished to explore was whether it was possible to use the peritoneal membrane for gas exchange, which is analogous to the way in which this same surface can be used for solute and fluid exchange with peritoneal dialysis. It has been shown that significant oxygenation can be achieved in small rodents by filling the abdominal cavity with oxygenated saline solution or gaseous oxygen, but this effect has not been replicated in large-animal models. 18, 19 It is thought that the relative decrease in the peritoneal surface area, with increasing animal size, is responsible for this loss of effect. 20 Our hypothesis was that using perfluorocarbons for gas exchange, in a perfusion circuit that maintains a high oxygen gradient, might overcome the limitation of a relatively smaller peritoneal surface area and permit significant levels of oxygen exchange in a large animal. To test this hypothesis, for proof of principle, we designed a large animal-induced hypoxia model.",

The animals were then intubated with an endotracheal tube having a 7.5-mm internal diameter (Mallinckrodt Inc; St. Louis, MO) and maintained with isoflurane inhalation anesthesia, using intermittent propofol injections for any evidence of discomfort or awakening. The animals were placed on a mechanical ventilator (Dual Phase Control Respirator Pump; Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA) with a tidal volume of 10 to 15 mL/kg and a rate of 12 to 15 breaths/min.

ECG leads were placed in the standard threelead positions on each animal, starting at the time of induction, and were continuously monitored throughout the experiment. Oxygen saturation was also measured with a pulse oximeter (Vet/Ox Plus 4700; SDI; Waukesha, WI) with the probe placed on the tongue of the animal.

Both of these lines were transduced using a pressure-monitoring kit with a pressure transducer (TruWave; Edwards Lifesciences) that was connected to a monitor system (model 78834A; Hewlett-Packard; Palo Alto, CA) for monitoring the systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures and the central venous pressure.",

Once optimization of the circuit was complete and the maximum flow rate for that animal was identified, the outflow catheter was clamped and the abdomen was allowed to fill with 5 to 7 L of fluid. Once this volume was infused into the abdomen, the inflow catheter was then clamped, thereby trapping the perfusate in the abdomen. In designing this model, we found that this maneuver, which did not affect the intraabdominal pressure, was necessary in order to assure that the siphon would resume and that the circuit could be restarted after having been stopped for several hours during the stepwise hypoxia portion of the experiments. Thus, in every case there was a large volume of perfusate, saline solution, or perfluorocarbon harbored in the abdomen during the collection of the \"circuit-off\" hypoxia measurements.",

The relative ease with which oxygenation can be increased in small-animal models, but not largeanimal models, is likely a function of the significantly increased ratio of the peritoneal surface to body mass in small animals. 22 Based on our results, we hypoth- esize that a perfusion circuit, with a medium like perfluorocarbon that is capable of carrying and unloading large quantities of oxygen, is necessary to achieve significant gas exchange through the peritoneal surface of a large animal. The measured augmentation of systemic oxygen levels by perfusing the peritoneum with oxygenated perfluorocarbon was uniform and statistically significant for all five levels of induced hypoxia.

Our hypothesis to explain this consistent finding is that the volume of indwelling perfluorocarbon in the abdomen likely served as an oxygen reservoir and resulted in blunting of the induced hypoxia effect on arterial oxygen concentrations as the Fio 2 was decreased from 18 to 10%. Although we were unable to directly measure the oxygen content of the perfluorocarbon, the perfluorocarbon would have initially equilibrated with atmospheric air, a Po 2 of approximately 160 mm Hg, and could have held as much as 2.5 to 3.5 L of available oxygen. 14 -17 Given the rapidity with which gradient-driven gasses dissolve in perfluorocarbons and the fact that tissues extract essentially all oxygen from perfluorocarbons before extracting oxygen from hemoglobin, one would assume that the dwelling perfluorocarbon served as a renewable oxygen reservoir as the animals were rendered progressively hypoxic. 23 That is, in addition to serving as an initial oxygen reservoir, it is likely that the reservoir was relatively \"renewed\" as the animals progressed from higher to lower levels of inspired oxygen. For example, if an animal was at an Fio 2 level of 16%, the perfluorocarbon would equilibrate to the tissues at this level and would then be higher than the tissue levels when the Fio 2 was decreased to 14%, thereby serving as a source of oxygen at the 14% Fio 2 level.",

            "text": "It is interesting to note that saline solution, dwelling in the abdomen or with the oxygenation circuit running, and perfluorocarbon, dwelling in the abdomen but without progressing to a lower Fio 2 , yielded essentially the same arterial oxygen concentrations at the lowest Fio 2 of 10% (Fig 2) . At this point, only activation of the oxygenation circuit, in the perfluorocarbon animals, resulted in increased arterial oxygen levels (Fig 2) . Examining the data at this lowest level of induced hypoxia is as close as we could come to eliminating the reservoir effect from our data. The necessity of maintaining a stagnant volume of perfusate in the abdomen during the progressive hypoxia measurements was a limitation of our experimental model. Another consistent trend, likely resulting from the limitations of our model, is the fact that all animals demonstrated their highest arterial oxygen concentrations at the initiation of the experiments, with the oxygenation circuits not running. Our experiments were designed to ferret out any potential effect from peritoneal perfusion. To magnify the effect from a gradient-driven phenomenon, we elected to drop the animals to the profound level of hypoxia induced by ventilating them with an Fio 2 of 10%. In retrospect, this degree of hypoxia is clinically irrelevant and likely placed the animals into a state of oxygen debt from which they could never recover during the ascending phase of the induced hypoxia measurements (Fig 1) . It is our hypothesis that this state of oxygen debt at the conclusion of the experiments is why all the animals demonstrated their highest levels of oxygenation at the beginning of the experiments, when they first entered a state of induced hypoxia (Fig 2) . We also feel that the parallel sequence of induced hypoxia increase and decrease, for both the saline solution and perfluorocarbon groups, is why the resulting data yielded parallel lines (Fig 2) for perfusate that was dwelling in the abdomen and perfusate that was circulating. Although the results of our principle experiments demonstrate that arterial oxygenation can be supplemented by instilling perfluorocarbon into the abdomen, partially with dwelling and more so by circulating oxygenated perfluorocarbon, it is important to view these results within the context of the short duration of the experiments, the peculiarities of our induced hypoxia model, and the statistically significant, but relatively small, sample size of our study. We designed this model to allow us to explore the effect of perfusion over a wide range of hypoxia. In order to specifically study the effects on oxygenation, we maintained the animals in a normocarbic state and, thus, cannot draw any conclusions regarding the impact of peritoneal perfluorocarbon perfusion to clear carbon dioxide. One could speculate, however, that the greater diffusivity of carbon dioxide compared to oxygen, and the very high solubility of carbon dioxide in perfluorocarbon would favor carbon dioxide clearance in a hypercarbic state.",

This degree of hypoxia was achieved in our model at an Fio 2 of 14%, which resulted in a mean arterial oxygen concentration of 39.4 mm Hg with oxygenated saline solution perfusion, and an Sao 2 of 73%. Perfusing the abdomen with oxygenated per- fluorocarbon, compared to perfusing it with oxygenated saline solution, resulted in an average difference of 15.9 mm Hg of oxygen, which correlated with an average arterial oxygen level of 55.3 mm Hg. This corresponded to an average increase in the Sao 2 from 73 to 89%. Although our experiments were short term, and strictly proof of principle, it is worth noting that this degree of augmentation in oxygenation could represent a potentially life-saving measure in a patient dying from reversible pulmonary failure.",

Another potential application would be to initiate this treatment in a prophylactic manner to prevent or limit ventilator-induced lung injury. 24 As a nonpulmonary technique for gas exchange, it could allow the clinician to decrease the toxic ventilator settings that are sometimes required to support a patient who is dying from potentially reversible lung failure. Such a technique could short circuit the \"catch-22\" that results when high ventilator settings exacerbate the underlying lung dysfunction and mandate even higher ventilator settings, further worsening the dysfunction. From a technical surgical perspective, it would not be difficult to institute this type of treatment at the bedside.",

            "text": "The results from these proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate that systemic oxygen levels can be increased in a large-animal induced hypoxia model by perfusing the peritoneal surface with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. The gas-dissolving and gas-unloading properties of perfluorocarbon were necessary as the same effect was not obtained when saline solution was employed as the perfusate. Although supplemental oxygenation has been demonstrated in small animals (with their relatively larger peritoneal surface) by using various techniques to oxygenate the abdominal cavity, this is the first demonstration of investigators being able to consistently accomplish this objective in a large animal. Further studies are indicated and will take the form of longer duration peritoneal perfusion runs to look for toxic side effects of this treatment, the evaluation of the impact of this technique on carbon dioxide clearance, the performance of this technique in disease models that simulate human conditions of severe pulmonary failure, and the exploration of interventions that can enhance gas exchange across the peritoneal membrane. We speculate that this technique could potentially find a role in the supportive care of patients with profound, but reversible, pulmonary failure. As this is a pulmonary-independent technique for supplementing oxygenation, there could even be a role for treating patients with less severe, but worsening, pulmonary failure in order to prevent the compounding problem of ventilator-induced lung injury.",
