Expression of epitope-tagged deletion derivatives of CENP-B in HeLa cells revealed that a single domain <158 residues from the amino terminus of the protein is sufficient to localize CENP-B to centromeres. Centromere localization was abolished if as few as 28 amino acids were removed from the amino terminus of CENP-B. The centromere localization signal of CENP-B T HE centromere (primary constriction) of human mitotic chromosomes consists ofa compacted network of heterochromatin containing highly repeated satellite DNA sequences and their associated proteins. The kinetochore, the site of microtubule attachment to the chromosomes (Luykx, 1965 ; Brinkley and Stubblefield, 1966; Jokelainen, 1967) , is situated at the surface of the centromeric heterochromatin . The kinetochore is now believed to be the location of the mechanochemical motors (such as dynein) (Pfarr et al ., 1990 ; Steuer et al., 1990; Wordernan et al., 1991) that move chromosomes in mitosis . Both gene expression and recombination are strongly suppressed in regions of heterochromatin (Brown, 1966; Henikoff, 1981; Daniels et al., 1986) . The interrelationship between the kinetochore and the underlying heterochromatin is unknown .",

CENP-B remains the best-characterized centromere protein (Earnshaw et al., 1987) . Variability in staining ofthe different chromosomes by CENP-B-specific antibodies initially led to the suggestion that binding of the protein to centromeres might be determined by DNA sequence (Earnshaw et al., 1987) . In confirmation of this, CENP-B was recently shown to bind specifically to a 17-bp sequence (termed the CENP-B box) present in some \u00ab-satellite DNA monomers, but not in others (Masumoto et al ., 1989) . CENP-B binds only to monomers containing the CENP-B box .

If introduced into the nucleus before the S/G2 transition, the antibodies interfere with the subsequent assembly of a functional outer kinetochore plate during mitosis .

However, certain IgG preparations that affect kinetochore function and morphology after microinjection recognize only CENP-B in immunoblots, suggesting that one target of the antibody inhibition is likely to be CENRB. Together, these results imply that the injected antibodies do not act directly at the kinetochore itself.

A 90-bp BamHI fragment encoding the El tag sequence was isolated from pSM224 (obtained from P. Chen and S. Michaelis, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) and inserted into the remaining (upstream) Bg1II site of pB -9-599 . Sequence analysis and restriction mapping confirmed that the resulting construct, pCNPBI-599, contained two tandem copies of the El tag sequence, in correct orientation and reading frame, upstream of CENP-B coding sequences . All subsequent tagged constructs generated in The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 116, 1992 this study are based upon this original construct, and thus contain two tandem copies of the El tag followed by 9 amino acids encoded by CENP-B upstream genomic sequences followed by CENP-B and/or TRP E coding sequences. The large DNA fragment (N4 .5 kb) produced by Sstl digestion of pCNPBI-599 was isolated and self-ligated to generate pCNPBI-465. The large DNA fragment (x+3.5 kb) produced by SstII digestion of pCNPBI-599 was isolated and self-ligated to generate pCNPBI-158 .",

Centromere Localization Domain of CENP-B expression constructs . This construct, pTRPE ( Fig. 1 D) , was used to transfect HeLa cells and its expression was assayed by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-tag antibody. The fusion protein in these cells, although predominantly nuclear, was distributed diffusely and was not specifically localized to centromeres, chromosomes, or any other nuclear substructure (Fig . 4 , J-L) . Similar results were seen regardless of whether the cells were fixed with cold methanol or formaldehyde, although additional cytoplasmic staining was seen in the methanol-fixed cells . While the mechanism for this nuclear localization of the TRPE fusion protein is unclear, the protein is small enough (ti44 kD ; see Fig . 6 A) to undergo passive diffusion through nuclear pores (Bonner, 1978) . These results confirmed that although an El-tagged TRPE fusion protein was able to gain entry to the nucleus, the El tag could not localize the protein to centromeres . Thus it is highly unlikely that the tag contributes to localization of recombinant CENRB variants to centromeres .",

First, they do not appear to express any form of endogenous CENP-B, as judged by immunofluorescence, using any of a number of polyclonal antibodies (W C, Earnshaw, unpublished; J . B.

Therefore, transfection of COS cells with mutant human CENP-B would not result in competition between endogenous and exogenous protein for specific binding to the DNA substrate . Second, the transfected CENRB is expected to remain soluble in COS cells, since African green monkey satellite DNA lacks the CENP-B box (J . B. Rattner, personal communication) . Third, COS cells constitutively express large T antigen, which enables replication of SV40 origin-containing plasmids, making itpossible toexpress particularly high levels of protein from cDNAs cloned into pECE vectors. Fourth, any posttranslational modifications associated with eukaryotes will be made in this expres-The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 116, 1992 sion system .

These experiments suggest that CENRB uses a direct mechanism, mediated by DNA binding to the CENP-B box, for localization to the centromere . Pluta The deduced amino acid sequence of CENRB (Earnshaw et al ., 1987) suggests that this protein is comprised of four domains separated by three hinge regions (Fig. 9) . The most prominent of these putative hinge regions, Al and A2, are characterized by extremely high concentrations of glutamic acid (glu) and aspartic acid (asp) residues, making it unlikely that either assumes a single stable secondary structure . Therefore, we have suggested that both Al and A2 are probably unstructured hinge regions (Pluta et al., 1990 ) . An additional putative hinge region separates domains I and II. This proline-rich motif (P-X-X-P), also occurs in MAP2 and tau (Joly et al., 1989) , where it has been shown to be a site of enhanced protease sensitivity. This is not the microtubulebinding region of either MAP2 or tau (Joly et al ., 1989) . Domain I of CENRB is absolutely conserved between the human and mouse homologues of this protein, and is distinguished by a basic DNA-binding motif characteristic of the helix-loop-helix protein family (Sullivan and Glass, 1991) .",

Firstly, in vitro CENRB binds specifically to a subset of a-satellite Figure 8 . The amino-terminal 158 amino acids of CENP-B bind specifically to individual human a-satellite DNA monomers containing the CENP-B box in vitro. The CENP-B proteins used for thebinding were obtained from extracts of African green monkey cells transfected with the truncated CENP-B proteins pCNPBI-158 or pCNPB47-599 (Fig. 1) . Individual biotin-labeled a-satellite DNA monomers either containing or lacking the CENP-B box were incubated with extracts expressing the truncated CENP-B proteins pCNPB47-599 (panels A) or pCNPBI-158 (panels B) . Streptavidin-agarose beads were introduced into the reactions to precipitate the DNA and associated proteins . The resulting pellets (P) and supernatants (S) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using antibody against the El tag. Analysis of the pellets and supernatants from control reactions performed in the absence of DNA (lanes 1-4) show that the proteins do not adhere to the agarose beads; lanes 1 and 3 are pellets, lanes 2 and 4 are supernatants . The anti-El antibody recognizes a single species in each extract. Lanes 5-10 are reactions with p17M15 (a-satellite DNA monomer containing the CENP-B box), and lanes 11-16 are with p17M5 (a-satellite DNA monomer lacking the CENP-B box) .

Thus the distribution of CENP-B in the heterochromatin can be modeled based on what is known about the distribution of CENP-B boxes. Examples of a-satellite monomers from all ofthe human chromosomes have been cloned and sequenced . These monomers (consensus length of 171 bp) exist in tandem arrays that form higher-order repeats, called alphoid subfamilies. Recently, the sequences of 293 different a-satellite monomers, representing 33 different subfamilies from 24 human chromosomes, have been compiled into an overall consensus sequence (Choo et al., 1991) . Analysis of the statistical data shows that within each monomer there is only one position where there is a significant probability of encountering a CENP-B box-position 127 of the overall consensus . Given the actual frequency of nucleotides observed at each position of the consensus (Choo et al., 1991) , the probability of a CENP-B box occurring in a given a-satellite monomer is 0.17 %, or approximately once in 600 monomers. In fact, the CENRB box was found to appear significantly more frequently than this in one selected group of cloned a-satellite monomers (Masumoto et al., 1989) .",

The most reasonable solution to the paradox is that CENRB is functionally redundant and that its role is shared with another chromosomal component . If CENRB activity is indeed important, and centromeres of Y chromosomes function in the same way as do those ofother chromosomes, then there must be a CENP-B homologue present on the Y chromosome that is undetectable with our polyclonal antibodies and that binds to a sequence distinct from the CENP-B box. Pluta This redundancy may explain why we have been unable to observe amitotic or cell cycle arrest phenotype in cells transfected with any of the constructs shown in Fig. 1 . When cultures transiently expressing proteins encoded by these constructs were observed by immunofluorescence microscopy, transfected cells in all phases of mitosis were detected . This was surprising, since the most obvious model for CENP-B function is that binding of domain I to a-satellite DNA permits the (presumably) mobile domains II-IV tocontact other components ofthe chromosome (Fig. 9) . Iftrue, this predicts (as suggested by Herskowitz, 1987 ) that occupancy of DNA binding sites by protein containing only domain I might be detrimental . In this case, DNA binding functions would be uncoupled from any functions normally carried out by the other CENP-B domains .",

Since alphoid arrays from different chromosomes have different patterns of occurrence of the CENRB box motif (Masumoto et al., 1989) , the distribution of CENP-B will also necessarily differ.",

In this case, the lattice constant is 171 bp, the length ofthe a-satellite monomer. Thus, although the probability of binding of CENRB to any given monomer will be low (since most monomers lack CENRB boxes), any CENRB molecules that are bound must exist in locally identical environments . Furthermore, all CENP-B molecules will be spaced at intervals of n x 171 bp, where n may be any integer, but will typically be between 4 and 35 (the range of alphoid array sizes observed to date; Choo et al., 1991) . Such a distribution has interesting potential consequences for the chromatin structure of the centromere. Figure 10 . Binding of CENPB to a-satellite chromatin is likely to affect the structure of the 30-run fiber (here modeled as a solenoid [Widom and Klug, 1985] ) . Assuming that the phasing of nucleosomes in human a-satellite chromatin resembles that in the African green monkey, the CENP-B box will be located on, or adjacent to, the internucleosomal linker. For nucleosomes with such a short linker (N6 bp), the CENP-B box is thus likely to be found in the interior of the solenoid. Binding of a highly negatively charged protein such as CENPB at this position may disrupt the continuity of the solenoid, as shown.",

The nucleosome phasing results thus suggest that CENPB will be localized immediately adjacent to, or within, the linker DNA between core particles.

It is entirely conceivable that presence of this concentration of negative charge in the interior ofthe solenoid might cause a significant disruption of the solenoidal lattice, as suggested The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 116, 1992 in Fig . 10 . Thus CENP-B may function as a \"solenoidbreaker\". In regions where CENP-B boxes occur with a frequency of greater than one in six nucleosomes (one turn of the solenoid) (Finch and Klug, 1976) , this could even preclude the formation of a classical solenoid structure . While this might seem to be the opposite of whatwould be expected for heterochromatin, it is possible that chromatin containing bound CENPB uses some other mechanism of condensation (such as looping) involving interactions between nonhistone proteins .",

CENP-B is a component of the mitotic chromosome scaffold fraction, and we would have predicted that the assembly of this protein into the centromere might involve protein-protein contacts in addition to protein-DNA contacts .

Given the tremendous uniformity of DNA sequence in a-satellite DNA, centromeric heterochromatin has the potential to form a highly ordered solenoidal structure that could extend over millions of base pairs . At the same time, the CENPB boxes may induce local perturbations of the solenoid lattice at intervals along its length that are directed by the underlying higher-order alphoid repeat (which differs from chromosome to chromosome) . The net result may be that the structure of centromeric heterochromatin differs significantly from that predicted for bulk chromatin by the solenoid model .",
