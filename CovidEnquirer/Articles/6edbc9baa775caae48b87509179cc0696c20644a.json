In an attempt to develop an efficient in vitro cultivation system for enterotropic MHV strains (MHV-RI and MHV-Y), 8 murine cell lines were inoculated with MHV-RI-or MI-IV-Y-infected infant mouse intestinal homogenates and screened for the production of cytopathic effects. MHV-RI and MHV-Y consistently produced cytopathic effects only in J774A.l cells. Both strains produced titers of > lo6 TCID,,/ml in subsequent passages in 5774.1 cells. MHV strains -1, -3, -A59, -JHM, -S and -DVIM also produced high-titer viral stocks in J774A.l cells. Therefore J774A.l cells are the first cells found that support the replication of these 8 enterotropic and respiratory MHV strains. After passage in J774A.l cells, MI-IV-RI and MHV-Y could infect previously non-susceptible cell lines (17Cl-1, CMT-93, N18 and NCTC 14691, though cytopathic effects were often negligible with MHV-RI. MHV-Y, but not MHV-RI, grew in L2(Percy) cells. Using L2(Percy) cells, an agarose overlay and Giemsa staining, MHV-Y could be quantified by plaque assay. Infant mouse bioassays, plaque assays and cell culture infections were compared for their sensitivity in detecting MI-IV-Y in infected intestinal homogenates and cell supematants.",

            "text": "Respiratory MHV strains, because they are easily propagated in vitro, have been studied intensively serving as the prototypes for coronavirus molecular biology and as models of viral hepatitis and encephalitis (Compton et al., 1993) . On the other hand, enterotropic MHV strains, such as MHV-RI and MHV-Y, are the most common strains found in contemporary mouse colonies (Barthold, 1986) , but little work has been done on their pathogenesis or molecular biology since they have been difficult to grow in vitro. MHV-RI was originally isolated in CMT-93 cells from a nude mouse intestine (Barthold et al., 1985) . MHV-Y was originally isolated in NCTC 1469 cells from the intestine of a naturally infected infant mouse with acute typhlocolitis (Barthold et al., 1982) . High-titered stocks of MHV-RI and MHV-Y have traditionally been generated in infant mouse intestines. Although stocks of MHV-RI can be generated in CMT-93 cells and stocks of MHV-Y can be generated in NCTC 1469 cells, viral titers produced are low (103-lo5 TCID,,/ml) (Barthold et al., 1982 (Barthold et al., , 1985 . More importantly, virus was recoverable from only a small proportion of MHV-infected intestinal homogenates using NCTC 1469 or CMT-93 cells. Therefore, virus production in tissues of mice infected with enterotropic MHV strains traditionally has been measured using an infant mouse bioassay, a costly and time-consuming procedure (Barthold, 1987) . Recently, detection of viral genome in intestinal homogenates using reverse transcriptase-PCR or monoclonal antibody solution hybridization have been used for detection, but not quantitation, of enterotropic MHV production in infected mouse tissues (Homberger et al., 1991; Kunita et al., 1992; Casebolt and Stephensen, 1992; Yamada et al., 1993) . We report the development of efficient in vitro propagation and quantitation methods for enterotropic MHV strains.",

J774A.l-adapted stocks of MHV-RI produced negligible CPE in 17Cl-1 and N18 cells, but produced viral titers of greater than 10' TCID,,/ml in both cell lines. We also investigated whether other MHV strains were able to grow in J774A.l cells. MHV-1, -3, -A59, -JHM and -S were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and MHV-DVIM was obtained from K. Holmes (Bethesda, MD). J774A.l adapted stocks of MHV-3, -JHM, -A59, -DVIM and -1 were generated by a single passage in J774A.l cells of mouse brain stocks of MHV3 and MHV-JHM, NCTC 1469 stocks of MHV-A59, MHV-S and MHV-DVIM and a 17Cl-1 stock of MHV-1. The 5 respiratory MHV strains (MHV-A59, -JHM, -S, -1, and -3) produced titers of > lo9 TCID,,/ml within 36 h pi. (Fig. 1) . In contrast, MHV-RI and Y had produced titers of only 104.75 and lo'.' TCID,,/ml at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 1) . MHV-DVIM, a strain of MHV which possesses characteristics of both respiratory and enterotropic MHV strains (the ability to cause both severe enteritis and hepatitis in infant Sencar mice) (Barthold and Compton, unpublished data) was intermediate in its virulence in J774A.l cells (Fig. 1) . The ability of all 8 MHV strains to grow in J774A.l cells makes J774A.l cells ideal for generating recombinant enterotropic/ respiratory MHV strains in cell culture. J774A.l cells will also be useful for comparing viral replication rates of enterotropic and respiratory MHV strains in a single permissive cell line.",

Briefly, L2(Percy) cells were grown in 12-well plates until confluency. Each well was rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and inoculated with 500 ~1 of diluted virus. After 1 h adsorption, the virus inocula was removed and 2 ml of 0.95% agarose in basal minimal medium was added. Plates were incubated at 33, 37 or 39\u00b0C in an 5% CO, atmosphere. Cell layers were fixed at 2 or 3 days p.i. by the addition of 2 ml of 10% buffered formalin and incubated at room temperature for at least 16 h. Formalin and agarose were removed, the cell sheet was rinsed once with PBS, stained with Giemsa for lo-15 min, and rinsed with distilled water. Plaques were counted and titers were expressed in log,, plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml of infected cell supernatant or 10% intestinal homogenate. MHV-Y produced equal numbers of plaques in L2(Percy) and L2.pl76 cells, but MHV-A59 produced much smaller and substantially fewer (> lOO-fold less) plaques in L2.pl76 cells than in L2(Percy) cells. Therefore, we chose to use L2(Percy) cells as our standard cell line for plaque assays. Addition of trypsin to the overlay media (at 2.5 pg/ml) increased MHV-Y plaque size slightly, but had little or no effect on plaque numbers and resulted in weakly staining monolayers. Pretreatment of cells with DEAE-D (75 pg/ml) and inclusion of DEAE-D (75 pg/ml) in viral inoculation media increased MHV-Y plaque numbers approximately two-fold, but resulted in fragile monolayers which often peeled off of the plates. Use of newly confluent cells rather than subconfluent cells or cells which had been confluent for more than 2 days resulted in the cell layers which stained the most evenly and plaques which were the easiest to visualize.

Therefore the decreased number of plaques observed at 33\u00b0C was probably due to the formation of plaques too small to be detected.

Enteritis doses were determined using groups of four 24-to 48-h-old Sencar mice inoculated orally with 10 ~1 of serial lo-fold dilutions of viral stock. Mice were killed at 48 h p.i., ilea, ceca and ascending colons were removed, processed for histology and examined microscopically for MHV lesions (syncytia, necrosis and inflammation) (Barthold et al., 1993) . Infant mouse ED,,s were calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (1938) . The titer of an MHV-Y stock passed exclusively in mouse intestines was equivalent as measured by plaque assay and infant mouse bioassay, but was several magnitudes higher than the viral titer as measured in cell culture infection of J774A.l cells (Table 2 ). In contrast titers of viral stocks serially passed in cell culture were equivalent as measured by plaque assay and tissue culture infection, but were several orders of magnitude higher than that measured in the infant mouse bioassay. This result suggests that passage of intestinal stocks of virus in cell culture leads to the selection of a subgroup of viruses which replicate well in cell culture, but poorly in the mouse. A single passage of cell culture-adapted MHV-Y in mouse intestine did not substantially alter the relative sensitivity of the different assay methods, suggesting that a single passage in the mouse is not sufficient to amplify a subpopulation of viruses from the cell culture adapted viral stocks which can grow efficiently in the mouse. The relative insensitivity of the TCID,, assay compared to the plaque assay in detecting MHV-Y in intestinal homogenates may be a result of differing fusion abilities of viruses in intestinal stocks in L2(Percy) and J774A.l cells. Approximately 75% of the L2(Percy) cells inoculated with 1% infant intestinal homogenates of MHV-Y were involved in syncytial formation at 48 h pi., whereas only 20-25% of the J774A.l cells inoculated with 1% infant intestinal homogenates of MHV-Y were involved in syncytial formation at 48 h p.i. J774A.l-adapted stocks of MHV-Y, had produced greater than 90% syncytial formation in both L2cPercy) and J774A.l cells at 48 h p.i. This result indicates that growth of MHV-Y stocks in J774A.l cells may have selected for a subpopulation of viruses which are highly fusagenic for both cell lines.",
