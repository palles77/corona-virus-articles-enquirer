To address this problem, real-time gene expression assays were coupled with cytokine Elispot and protein analyses to assess the nature of the anti-PRRSV response of pigs immunized with modified live virus (MLV) vaccine. Although T helper 1 (Th1) immunity was elicited in all vaccinated animals, as evidenced by the genesis of PRRSV-specific interferon-gamma secreting cells (IFNG SC), the overall extent of the memory response was variable and generally weak. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from these pigs responded to PRRSV exposure with a limited increase in their expression of the Th1 immune markers, IFNG, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-15 (IL15), and a reduction in the quantity of mRNAs encoding the innate and inflammatory proteins, IL1B, IL8 and IFNA. Efforts to enhance Th1 immunity, by utilizing an expression plasmid encoding porcine IFNA (pINA) as an adjuvant, resulted in a temporary increase in the frequency of PRRSVspecific IFNG SC but only minor changes overall in the expression of Th1 associated cytokine or innate immune marker mRNA by virus-stimulated PBMC. Administration of pINA, however, did correlate with decreased IL1B secretion by cultured, unstimulated PBMC but had no effect on their ability to release IFNG. Thus, while exogenous addition of IFNA during PRRSV",

Since attenuated, modified live virus (MLV) is clearly superior to inactivated PRRSV in regards to eliciting an immune response, the former is preferentially used for immunizations of swine. In an attempt to increase the pigs' resiliency against both homologous and heterologous PRRSV challenge, research worldwide has been directed towards improving vaccine formulations. For instance, in the last decade numerous groups have evaluated the use of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules as adjuvants during immunization of swine (Pasquini et al., 1997; Zuckermann et al., 1998 Zuckermann et al., , 1999 Somasundaram et al., 1999; Murtaugh et al., 2002; Foss et al., 2002; Boyaka et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2004) . Initially, exogenous recombinant interleukin-12 (rIL12) was found to enhance the cellular immune response to PRRSV, both in vitro and in vivo (Foss et al., 2002; Meier et al., 2003) . However, our recent data has shown that better stimulation of anti-PRRSV immunity was provided by exposure to a different cytokine, interferon-alpha (IFNA) (Meier et al., 2004) .",

The T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine, IFNG, as well as innate immune markers, the inflammatory interleukins, IL1B, IL6 and IL8, have been detected in virus-infected pigs (Aasted et al., 2002; Bassaganya-Riera et al., 2004; Thanawongnuwech et al., 2001 Thanawongnuwech and Thacker, 2003) . However, when the immune responses in pigs' lungs to different swine viruses were compared, the quantities of numerous secreted cytokines appeared to be much lower in the presence of PRRSV than when either swine influenza virus (SIV) or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) was present in this organ (Van Reeth et al., 1999 , 2002 Van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000) . Similarly, PRRSV has been found to elicit a substantially weaker, peripheral blood IFNG response than pseudorabies virus (PRV) (Meier et al., 2003) . Likewise, PRRSV has been shown to be a poor stimulator of innate cytokine production (Albina et al., 1998a,b; Buddaert et al., 1998; Van Reeth et al., 1999; Chung et al., 2004) in contrast to most viruses that elicit copious amounts of IFNA and IFNB. Since these two cytokines are involved in the generation of antiviral IFNG secreting cells (SC) (Levy et al., 2003a,b) , a deficit in innate cytokine production following PRRSV infection could be a cause of the weak adaptive IFNG response.",

In addition to the above mentioned 5 weeks post-primary vaccination, samples were obtained 3 weeks earlier and 2, 5 and 8 weeks later to represent an interval beginning 2 weeks after the initial immunization and terminating 5 weeks after the booster immunization. For each time point and gene the results from the nine animals were averaged (Fig. 4) . [For details of average C t values and statistics refer to Table 2 ]. Overall, IFNG mRNA levels were up-regulated by 1.8 to 2.9-fold (significantly at 2.5-fold starting at week 4 post-MLV), relative to pre-vaccination levels and, surprisingly, were not substantially increased after the MLV boost at week 8. Significant sustained increases were also noted in the quantities of transcripts encoding TNFA (1.9 to 2.6-fold) and IL15 (2.8 to 4.2-fold). Likewise, there were some increases in IL18 gene expression, in contrast to a weak down-regulation of IL12A, IL12B, and IL12RB2 gene activity (Fig. 4) .

Although IL13 and IL23 mRNA levels were also analyzed, the obtained values were too low The frequencies of virus-specific IFNG SC in pig PBMC populations, cultured for 48 h in vitro with PRRS viral strain VR-2332, at 5.5 weeks post-PRRSV MLV immunization were determined using an ELISPOT assay. (B) Immune gene expression profiles using real time PCR of cDNA prepared from bulk PBMC cultures, stimulated in vitro with PRRSV for 48 h, and measured as described in Section 2. Results represent the relative ratio of C t values of the indicated genes at 5.5 weeks to 0 weeks post-PRRSV MLV immunization. Squares are color-coded to denote either up-or down-regulation of gene expression. Fig. 1 during their peak IFNG response to PRRSV (weeks 4 and 5 post-primary vaccination) and the frequencies of virus-specific IFNG SC in these populations were determined via an ELISPOT assay. The frequency of innate IFNA SC in the pigs' PBMC populations was measured at 5 weeks after the booster immunization (week 13 post-primary vaccination) by using an ELISPOT assay. The average IFNG response was compared to the IFNA response on an individual basis for members of litter A (circles) and B (diamonds). Regression analyses confirmed that these two types of immune functions were correlated on a pig by pig basis with R = 0.6 at a P 0.001 level.",

Since IFNA production is presumably reduced after PRRSV vaccination (Fig.  4) , the exogenous addition of this cytokine might compensate for this deficiency and thus stimulate cellmediated immunity. The pINA plasmid was derived from the pcDNA vector that alone can apparently stimulate IFNA gene expression in pigs (Johansson et al., 2002) . Therefore, it is not clear what impact is provided by the plasmid DNA itself as opposed to the encoded protein. Accordingly, we wanted to explore in more detail the effects of using the pINA biologic in conjunction with the MLV vaccine. To compensate for a nucleic acid effect on elicited immunity, in addition to the mock-treated and pINA-injected vaccinated groups, a third set of MLV-immunized pigs received a control plasmid, pANI, in which the IFNA cDNA had been inverted to prevent IFNA expression yet maintain the integrity of the DNA.",

Likewise, the quantities of transcripts encoding the Th1 markers, TNFA (>9-fold) and STAT1 (>2.9-fold), were greater at week 2 after immunization, although they had lessened by week 4. In contrast to our earlier results (Fig. 4) , a significant up-regulation of IL12B, and IL12RB2 gene expression (5 to 13-fold) was found at week 2 after vaccination for all 3 groups but had dissipated 2 weeks later. However it should be noted ( Table 3 ) that these genes were expressed at low levels at week 0 (C t values = 34 and 31, respectively). Although activity of the Th1 marker IL15 gene had increased in all groups at week 2 post-vaccination, this change was only significant (>30-fold) for the MLV-immunized only group. Two weeks later, a significant increase was noted for the animals injected with pINA.

PBMC were restimulated 24 h with PRRSV, pelleted and stored at \u00c070 8C until RNA and cDNA were prepared. Immune marker gene expression was analyzed as described in Section 2. Results represent the relative ratio of C t values obtained for PBMC isolated at 2 or 4 weeks post-PRRSV MLV immunization for 5 pigs/group compared to data acquired prior to vaccination. Squares are color-coded to denote either up-or down-regulation of the indicated genes. Significant differences (P < 0.05) between the values derived at either 2 or 4 weeks post-vaccination were calculated relative to week 0 data and noted by the letter ''s''. Swine immune marker expression (C t values) for each gene and cDNA sample is noted. Data were averaged (mean AE S.D.) for each week after vaccination. a C t values for the same gene noted by different letters are significantly different at P < 0.05 from each other. b Gene expression (C t values) > 35 are not included in the final analyses because of poor assay sensitivity.",

Due to the small numbers of pigs in each group only the differences in the concentrations of IL1B were found to be statistically significantly lower for cells from the pINA-treated pigs. All cell culture supernatants contained high levels of IL8 but lacked detectable quantities of TNFA regardless of the immunization protocol (data not shown).

This notion is supported by the fact that, like other viruses, PRRSV is susceptible to the inhibitory effect of IFNG (Bautista and Molitor, 1999; Rowland et al., 2001) . It is also notable that although PRRSV is also vulnerable to the antiviral effects of IFNA, it differs from most viruses in its inability to stimulate the production of this cytokine in vivo (Albina et al., 1998a) . For instance, during an acute PRRSV infection the presence of IFNA in the lung of pigs was either undetectable (Albina et al., 1998b) , minimal (Van Reeth et al., 1999) , or substantially lower than that induced by PRCV (Buddaert et al., 1998) . Indeed, even when alveolar macrophages infected with PRRSV were superinfected with swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an otherwise strong inducer of IFNA production, secretion of this cytokine was not detected (Albina et al., 1998a) . Although, the mechanism responsible for the lack of IFNA response is currently unknown, the data from Albina et al. (1998) , suggested the existence of an active suppression of the IFNA response.

This observation is similar to that reported between the ex vivo production of IFNA and IFNG in HIV-1 infected individuals (Hober et al., 1998) . This relationship suggests that despite the poor IFNA induction in response to PRRSV, those animals with the highest capacity to produce IFNA when exposed to this virus are also more likely to develop a relatively stronger IFNG response. In support of this concept is the demonstration that as a group, the pigs in litter A exhibited both higher IFNA and IFNG responses to PRRSV as compared to those in litter B. This connection could be attributed to the known positive effect of IFNA in promoting the differentiation of virus-specific T cells into effector cells capable of secreting IFNG Nguyen et al., 2002) . Thus, the use of exogenous IFNA as an adjuvant, which in our studies clearly enhanced the development of T cell-mediated immunity, requires further scrutiny. Additionally, investigations concerning the genetic basis of susceptibility of pigs to PRRSV, especially in regards to a greater innate ability to produce IFNA in response to infection with PRRSV or other viruses, should be continued.",

This cytokine is present in the lungs (Johnsen et al., 2002; Chung and Chae, 2003; Labarque et al., 2003) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (Thanawongnuwech and Thacker, 2003) of PRRSV-infected pigs and can decrease anti-viral associated IFNG production (Liu et al., 2003; Marshall et al., 2003) . That IL10, whose synthesis is induced by PRRSV, may have a potential role in hampering an adequate Th1 response was made evident by the observation that PBMC isolated from classical swine fever virus (CSFV)immunized pigs when subsequently incubated with PRRSV had increased amounts of IL10 mRNA, concomitant with decreased IFNG gene expression after stimulation with CSFV recall viral antigen . Thus, the presence of IL10 could adversely affect the potentially protective antiviral immune response. In this regard, elicitation of IL10 production by macrophages is a common mechanism used by viruses to suppress or delay the host immune response and facilitate the infection process (Redpath et al., 2001) . As we have shown here, IL10 is spontaneously secreted by PBMC from pigs exposed to an attenuated PRRSV vaccine 2 weeks earlier. Surprisingly, this process can be partially reversed by the administration of a porcine IFNA-expressing plasmid at the time of vaccination with PRRS MLV; PBMC from such treated animals secreted relatively less IL10 than cells from MLV only immunized pigs.",

            "text": "A remarkable characteristic of the host reaction to PRRSV is the development of a substantial humoral immune response which is associated with a polyclonal B cell activation that results in increased amounts of total immunoglobulins (Lemke et al., 2004) . It is interesting to note that since the inflammatory cytokine IL6 promotes the terminal differentiation of activated B cells into antibodysecreting cells (Diehl and Rincon, 2002) , it might also be involved in the B cell polyclonal activation that is observed as a result of PRRSV infection. In this regard, elevated IL6 levels in the sera of pigs infected with PRRSV has been previously reported (Asai et al., 1999; Feng et al., 2003) and found to be associated with heightened quantities of serum haptoglobin, but not alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (Asai et al., 1999) . Lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) is also known to stimulate the production of IL6 by macrophages, in this case in mice, raising the suggestion that this cytokine might be partly responsible for the polyclonal B cell activation seen during infection by this murine virus (Markine-Goriaynoff et al., 2001) . In both of our experiments IL6 mRNA from PRRSV activated PBMC was significantly and transiently up-regulated at week 2 after immunization, and was correlated with expression of IL6 protein by PBMC cultured without virus. Notably, IL6 is known to inhibit Th1 differentiation by enhancing suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 expression, which in turn interferes with IFNG signaling and the development of Th1 cells (Diehl et al., 2000; Diehl and Rincon, 2002) . In our experiments an increase in SOCS1 gene expression was observed in PBMC at 2 weeks after MLV vaccination. Thus, IL6 production during the development of the adaptive immune response to PRRSV could be contributing to the low frequencies of IFNG SC created in response to vaccination against this virus. It is notable that, although not statistically significant, the amounts of IL6 mRNA present in virus-stimulated PBMC obtained at 2 weeks after vaccination from immunized pigs also receiving the pINA plasmid tended to be lower as compared to when the cells originated from members of the other two vaccinated groups. This agrees with recent work from Larsen and Olsen (2002) who found that the administration of an IL6 expressing plasmid during vaccination for swine influenza did not enhance vaccine efficacy. Based on these results and a higher frequency of PRRSV-specific IFNG SC associated with the group immunized with the pINA-adjuvanted MLV vaccine, it can be speculated that the presence of IFNA at the time of vaccination might have other benefits besides increasing the intensity of the IFNG response. For instance, by diminishing the production of IL6, it is conceivable that the ability of PRRSV to elicit polyclonal B cell activation and a strong but ineffective non-neutralizing antibody response might be moderated. Such a modulation could help maintain the health of the animal by reducing the lymphadenopathy that is associated with PRRSV infection and due primarily to lymphoid follicle hyperplasia (Lemke et al., 2004) . Moreover, a lower concentration of IL6 might provide an environment more conducive to the development of a strong IFNG response, which in turn might provide a better degree of protective immunity.",

            "text": "The results of our previous study (Meier et al., 2003) combined with those by Lemke et al. (2004) suggest that the reaction of swine to PRRSV infection is characterized by a strong humoral immune response and a weak to negligible IFNG response. Based on the results presented here, as well as those of others discussed above, we propose that the nature of the initial innate immune response to the virus is likely responsible for this polarized immunity. Specifically, we propose that the combination of a limited IFNA response, and a sustained production of IL1, IL6 and possibly IL10 during the first two weeks after exposure to the PRRS virus, play critical roles in facilitating the development of a weak Th1 immune response. The observation that the provision of an exogenous source of IFNA at the time of vaccination resulted in an increased presence of IFNG SC and a reduction in the amounts of IL1, IL6 and IL10 readily secreted by PBMC, is consistent with this notion. Together these results suggest that the polarized immune response to PRRS virus is likely regulated in a fashion akin to what has been described in the Th1/ Th2 paradigm in humans and rodents, and that this response may be altered by exogenous cytokine administration.",

            "text": "Our results demonstrate that exogenous IFNA introduced in the form of expressible cDNA enhanced the development of vaccine-induced PRRSV-specific cellular immunity but had a limited impact on immune gene expression by PBMC encountering recall antigen. Thus co-administration of cytokine-encoding plasmid and PRRS MLV has the potential to enhance vaccine induced immune responses considered to be protective in nature. Vaccine studies in Sweden indicated that the pcDNA vector alone could help stimulate IFNA responses (Magnusson et al., 2001; Johansson et al., 2002) . Adenoviruses expressing interferon alpha and a foot-and-mouth disease virus subunit provided immediate protection from foot-andmouth disease . Further exploration of IFNA adjuvants will likely contribute to deciphering the immunobiology of PRRSV, and indicate the feasibility and complexity of using gene therapy technology to increase the immunogenicity of conventional vaccines. Since it is clear that PRRSV has the intrinsic capacity to polarize the immune response of the pig into one primarily of a non-protective humoral nature, future experiments should include the use of even more aggressive immune-modulating strategies to obtain the timely development of a strong virus-inhibitory immune response that can provide adequate levels of protection to most if not all individuals in a population.",
