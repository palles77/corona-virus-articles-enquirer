An expression frequently found in microbiologic DNA testing is NAT (nucleic acid amplification technique). NAT refers to a number of techniques apart from PCR that can be used to amplify DNA, e.g., ligase chain reaction. For convenience, the description \"PCR\" will be used interchangeably with \"NAT\" to indicate broadly based amplification of DNA. To synthesise or design a DNA probe or primer, it is necessary to sequence an organism's DNA to identify species-specific regions (see Table A .2, which provides more information about probes and primers). Today, whole genomes from many pathogens have been sequenced, and this information is available on databases. From this sequence (1) ",

Apart from the straightforward diagnostic applications, DNA microbiological testing has been used to detect antimicrobial resistance (methicillinresistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci spp) or toxigenic forms of E. coli. More recently, the availability of DNA technology to quantitate HCV and HIV has been useful in planning and monitoring treatment. Table 8 .4 provides some scenarios involving DNA testing. Unlike molecular genetic (DNA) testing, commercially produced kits have made an early entry into molecular microbiology, and they allow a wider range of laborato-ries to participate in this technology.

The successful completion of genomic sequencing for a number of microorganisms was both a catalyst for the human sequencing endeavour as well as the characterisation of genomes from additional model organisms.

Therefore, mutations are constantly being produced in the HIV genes, and mutant viruses will form. This, combined with the high viral titres present, facilitates the development of resistance. The key to success with AIDS treatment has been HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy), which became available in 1996 and involves the use of multiple drugs directed to different viral pathways. Combination drug therapies involve the use of three drugs having a synergistic rather than additive effect on reducing the viral load, and so they delay the development of drug resistance. Various combinations are used, for example, two nucleoside and nucleotide analogues with the third drug a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a protease inhibitor. More recently, a fourth class of drug with a completely new mechanism of action has been developed. This involves inhibiting the entry of HIV-1 into CD4 + lymphocytes. The major questions now requiring resolution include when to start HAART and what are the optimal drug combinations (more than 20 drugs are approved by the FDA for treating HIV infection). Despite the use of HAART, HIV re-emerges once therapy is stopped, indicating a virostatic rather than virocidal effect. Better drugs are still needed, but more importantly, a vaccine that will allow the prevention of HIV-AIDS.",

Long-term complications with this DNA virus occur in about 15% of those infected and include chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Why some go on to develop a chronic carrier state is not known, with the course of the illness after infection very variable. This has been explained on the basis that it involves the viral genotype and the host's immune responses; i.e., following acute infection, a vigorous T cell response against the various viral-specific components (core, envelope and polymerase) limits the infection. In contrast, those with a poor cellular immune response are more likely to develop a chronic carrier state. In this scenario, the MHC will play a key role since class II molecules from the HLA complex are critical for T cells to function. Evidence for an MHC-related effect in hepatitis B infection is presented in Table 8 .8.",

However, the spread of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum, and to a lesser extent Plasmodium vivax, has made the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria a global public health issue. Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum is present in every major region where malaria is endemic. Air travel means that drug-resistant strains can appear in any city. Resistance is now spreading since the 1950s from a limited number of foci in South East Asia and South America. The epidemiology is consistent with multigenic effects, i.e., rare events occurring initially in South East Asia or South America and then spreading slowly worldwide. In contrast, resistance to pyrimethamine and proguanil has arisen independently in many different regions where these drugs have been used, consistent with a single gene being involved. The molecular basis for resistance in malaria is slowly being unravelled, and many genes are now implicated (Table 8 .10). As the molecular defects become more comprehensively characterised, it will be possible to predict the drug resistance pattern for various geographic regions and so optimise drug selection. It might also be feasible to use other drugs or genetic-based therapies to bypass the resistance defect in the parasites, allowing the continuing use of what are cost-effective and relatively safe drugs such as chloroquine. Another positive development in the therapy of malaria is the availability of the DNA sequence from the genomes of the important human and mouse malaria parasites.

An in vitro characteristic of EBV is its ability to immortalise lymphocytes, an application that Normal Cervix",

Infection can be transient (and so reversal of the HPV effects on cervical epithelium is possible), but once HPV infection is persistent, it can lead to pre-cancerous lesions that can progress to cervical cancer. Other factors associated with the development of cervical cancer include early sexual activity (<16 years of age), >4 sexual partners, and a history of genital warts. Other independent risk factors that might interact with the HPV include HIV infection, immunosuppression and cigarette smoking. 11, 40, 42, 43, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, CP6108 73, 82, (26, 53, 66) is very useful in the research laboratory to provide a permanent supply of a particular cell line (or an unlimited source of DNA). In the immortalised lymphocyte, EBV does not replicate but remains as multiple extrachromosomal copies of the circular viral DNA genome in the cell. Latent infection with EBV is accompanied by the expression of a set of viral latent genes. These genes and their respective proteins are well characterised and include (1) six nuclear antigens: EBNAs 1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C and LP; (2) three latent membrane proteins: LMPs 1, 2A and 2B and (3) EBERs 1, 2-small, non-polyadenylated non-coding RNAs.",

Tumours in which EBV is found include Burkitt's lymphoma, post-transplant B cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In each, various latent genes and proteins will be detected. Two important ones (these are always present in the laboratory-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines) are EBNA2 and LMP1. The former is a transcriptional regulator; hence, inappropriate expression of this gene will have far-reaching effects on cell proliferation. LMP1 in experimental studies behaves as an oncogene. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a tumour that is predominantly found in China and South East Asia. The latency genes EBNA1, EBERs and LMP1 are frequently found in this tumour. A recent study used Q-PCR to quantitate EBV-specific DNA (in the form of EBNA3 and LMP1) in the plasma and tumours from nearly 100 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This study showed that the amount of EBV DNA in the plasma correlated closely with the stage of the cancer with the most DNA found in tumours that had metastasised. The authors (Lin et al 2004) suggested that monitoring for EBV DNA in the plasma was an effective way to predict outcome to treatment.",

Fortunately, the culling of more than a million chickens controlled this particular outbreak. Since then, there have been other human cases, with the most recent reported in Vietnam and Thailand. This RNA virus has two key surface glycoproteins: (1) haemagglutinin (HA), which facilitates the entry of virus into host cells through attachment to sialic acid receptors, and (2) neuraminidase (NA), which is involved in the release of progeny virions from infected cells. The HA is the major determinant against which are directed neutralising antibodies and so also the target for influenza vaccines. In contrast, the NA is an important target for antiviral agents. ",

The hosts include water birds, chickens, pigs and humans. A worrying trend is the increasing number of new subtypes in humans, as well as an expanding animal involvement since 1997. By late 2004, 44 humans had contracted the avian flu, and 32 of them had died (73% mortality if the infected person was ill enough to be admitted). The \"Spanish\" (H1N1) flu epidemic in 1918 killed over 20 million people. However, mortality associated with this infection was estimated to be 2.5%, and so considerably less than what is being seen with H5N1 avian flu. It is possible that there have been milder cases of the H5N1 flu that have gone unrecognised, but this worrying comparison as well as the broadening host range for the H5N1 virus (particularly the involvement of the pig) remain important global concerns. In contrast to the common human influenza virus (H3N2), which is highly contagious but rarely lethal, the avian flu in chickens is a particularly virulent type that can kill rapidly and that causes widespread organ damage. On the other hand, it is not easily transmitted from birds to humans or human to humans. So far only two probable cases of human to human transmission have occurred. However, swapping of genetic material should an individual be co-infected with both might produce a hybrid H5 (avian flu) N2 (human flu) virus with devastating effects. Another way for this mixing to occur (called reassortment) would involve an animal such as a pig being simultaneously infected with both the human influenza virus and the bird flu virus. This mixing might produce a new virulent virus if it had human genes (allowing human-to-human spread) and lethal genes from the bird virus. DNA sequencing of the viral genome from various outbreaks has shown: (1) Viruses from 1997 and 2003 Hong Kong infections have mutated; i.e., their DNA sequences are different. (2) Viruses from the most recent Vietnam and Thailand outbreak show that the virus is resistant to two of the four antiviral agents available.",

One person died in New York in late 2003 from an H7N2-type influenza A infection although details of how this occurred are not known. The culling of many birds has controlled the risk of avian flu to humans, but the virus continues to re-emerge in poultry in several Asian countries, with a suggestion that H5N1 might be increasing in pathogenicity and becoming more widespread. Close surveillance by the WHO, the CDC and other bodies continues. Another concern is that clinical features and travel history of individuals who might have SARS (discussed below) and flu virus H5N1 are similar. Hence, vigilance by health professionals and airport monitoring continues, particularly in those with a travel history and respiratory symptoms suggestive of these infections.

Therefore, it was surprising when two patients developed a severe form of hydatid disease in Alaska. One explanation for this different clinical profile was infection from some other geographic region (both had visited the lower United States). However, in one patient, DNA analysis of the E. granulosus showed that it was the G8 genotype, i.e., what would normally be found in Alaska. This was confirmed by showing that a number of infected moose carried the identical strain. The case provides further understanding of the G8 variant of E. granulosus, which normally follows a relatively benign natural history, but in some unusual cases (for reasons as yet unknown) it can produce severe disease. Until DNA analysis became available, this level of understanding of hydatid disease would not have been possible. epidemiologic sense, an understanding of virulence pathways facilitates the investigation of disease outbreaks, particularly nosocomial ones, since it allows a mix of organisms that are likely to be present to be accurately typed and, from this, determine which strains or subtypes are responsible for the infection.",

This was followed by the emergence of vancomycin-resistant MRSA in 1996. MRSA developed when S. aureus acquired a large segment of DNA (called SCCmec) that integrated into the S. aureus chromosome. This segment of DNA looks like an antibiotic \"resistance cassette\" because it contains genes for b lactam resistance and genes for resistance against non-b-lactam antibiotics. Vancomycin resistance is thought to have occurred with the emergence of a strain of S. aureus that had a thickened cell wall, thereby preventing the vancomycin from getting into the pathogen. Antibiotic-resistant S. aureus is an important and frequent cause of nosocomial infections in hospitals. When this occurs, infection control protocols need to identify the source(s) of the methicillin-resistant S. aureus and then determine whether there has been a breakdown in infection control practices so that more effective preventative measures can be implemented in future. For the above to occur, the different bacterial subtypes need to be distinguished. Phage typing has been the traditional tool in epidemiological studies involving S. aureus. However, this method has poor reproducibility, it is not able to type all isolates and it is impractical for most laboratories since it requires a large number of phage stocks to be maintained. Phage typing is now being replaced by DNA-based tests. Like the example of Legionella, MRSA typing can involve a wide range of techniques from PFGE to PCR.

For example, yellow fever is thought to have emerged in the New World as a result of the African slave trade, which brought the mosquito Aedes aegypti in ships' water containers. More recently, Aedes albopictus, a potential vector for dengue virus, has become established in the USA following its conveyance from South East Asia in old car tyres. With this, the threat of dengue in the North American continent has become real. Most emergent viruses are zoonotic; i.e., they are acquired from animals, which are reservoirs for infection. Thus, completely new strains are less likely than the appearance of a virus following a change in animal reservoirs. This is particularly relevant to the modern world where the consequences of easy migration, deforestation, agricultural practices, dam building and urbanisation are making, and will continue to have, a major impact on the ecology of animals. At the same time, humans have increasingly populated rural areas and are pursuing more outdoor recreational activities. There is also a growing trend for keeping exotic animals as household pets. Changes in global climate may also contribute directly, through their effects on vegetation, insect and rodent populations. Table 8 .14 lists a number of zoonoses that have become established as new infectious diseases or are emerging as problems for the future. Some of them are newly acquired in the West, whereas others remain endemic to specific countries. In many cases, molecular medicine offers little to current management including diagnosis, although much knowledge about these infections has come from analysis of the organisms' DNA or RNA. However, the potential for spread of any disease is high because of international travel or the mass dislocation of large populations following civil unrest. There is also an increasing awareness that a number of pathogens could be used for bioterrorism. Some of the zoonoses associated with a viral haemorrhagic clinical picture can be confused with other clinical infections including malaria, leptospirosis and Neisseria meningitidis, and in these potentially fatal conditions, a rapid screening test is essential. In terms of bioterrorism and the differential diagnosis of haemorrhagic fevers, PCR (NAT) based assays are presently the only options with the potential to allow rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests to be developed.",

Communicable respiratory infections traditionally infect others because of droplet spread or contact with contaminated surfaces. Some preliminary data are now being reported that SARS-CoV involves airborne transmission. If proven, this will be an interesting public health challenge requiring a better understanding of this mode of transmission, including its relationship to modern housing, travel and working environments. Detecting viral particles involved in airborne spread will not be easy, and for this PCR will become an indispensable tool for the public health professional.",

            "text": "After the 2001 anthrax bioterror cases in the USA, the world has been placed on alert. A new form of modern terrorism had been launched. In Chapter 9 reference is made to the US government's move to develop \"microbial forensics\" as a way in which to deal with bioterrorism or biocrimes involving the use of human or animal pathogens. DNA technology will be a particularly valuable asset in microbial forensics, allowing the rapid identification of various pathogens, and as part of the detective work, to find the source of the infection. As discussed further in Chapters 1 and 9, it is fortuitous that a component of the Human Genome Project was the sequencing of genomes from a number of pathogens. This information will be needed in combating bioterrorism. Biological warfare or bioterrorism is possible through many ways, including the contamination of food or water supplies, or via infected animals including insects. A more serious form would involve the use of aerosols containing the pathogens because now there is the risk for infecting a very large number of people. The length of the incubation period is also a consideration since it would, to some degree, influence the number infected before containment or treatment was initiated. Biosensors are being developed to assist early detection. In some infections, DNA-based chip technology is being tried as a way in which microbes can be detected directly through their DNA sequence. This will ensure rapid detection and typing of pathogens. Two pathogens of particular relevance to bioterror are anthrax and smallpox. DNA-based genotyping has already proven its value in the case of the 2001 US anthrax cases (Box 8.3). Promising reports now suggest that a pathogen such as anthrax could be detected within an hour by real-time PCR. Smallpox is another serious infection since routine vaccination was stopped in the USA in the early 1970s, leaving many unvaccinated and so vulnerable targets in this and other countries. In Asia, case fatality rates of around 30% were observed during epidemics, and there are no known treatments for smallpox. As part of its biologic warfare program, the former Soviet Union produced smallpox, anthrax and other pathogens, and it remains a concern that some could fall into the hands of potential terrorists. BSE (mad cow disease) is caused by a prion, i.e., abnormal form of a protein (PrP) that can spread from one organism to another and interfere with the shape of the normal protein.",

In the UK, BSE resulted from the feeding of contaminated food to cattle. A similar disease is found in sheep and goats (called scrapie). In humans, the same disease is called CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). There are a number of forms of CJD. The sporadic type is rare and occurs in the elderly. The inherited form is also rare, and it can be shown to have mutations in the PRNP gene. Iatrogenic CJD occurs from contaminated instruments or human products. Because the prion is not a traditional pathogen, sterilisation methods are not effective. Variant CJD (vCJD) is the result of direct animal-to-human spread (through contaminated beef products). vCJD has not been transmitted by blood, but because of the long incubation period possible (perhaps 30 or more years), this cannot be excluded, and some disturbing experimental data suggest that this is possible.",

The two exceptions were a 61-year-old woman in New York City and a 94-year-old woman in Connecticut. Both died after developing inhalational anthrax. It was possible to detect a likely source of infection in the case of the Connecticut victim. The postal processing and distribution centre (PDCs) for the letter-related cases had been identified through the finding of contaminating bacteria. However, for this victim, no samples from her home or personal items tested positive for B. anthracis. It was known that she had received mail (including junk or bulk mail) from one of these PDCs. It was also subsequently shown that her local PDC (Southern Connecticut) had a heavily contaminated sorting machine. From this, it was assumed that B. anthracis identical to those involved in the other outbreaks had infected her through a letter directly contaminated in a PDC implicated in the earlier infections, or secondarily contaminated in the Southern Connecticut PDC.",

A challenge for the future will be a better understanding of what the finding of a DNA (or RNA) sequence means in terms of infectivity and pathogenesis. The traditional approach has many years of experience to help in interpreting a result such as a positive culture. The same experience is not available with DNA testing, but it will be necessary to do the hard work and determine the significance of various DNA tests. An example would be persistence of mycobacterial growth in culture despite treatment. This would suggest a compliance issue or the development of drug resistance. The finding of a persistently positive DNA test in this circumstance would be more difficult to interpret. The validation of positive DNA test results will be necessary for a wide range of infections; for example, the finding of CMV DNA by PCR in a patient's serum could mean active disease or latent infection. How these issues are resolved will be impor-tant for the integration of molecular diagnostics into routine microbiological laboratory practice.",

            "text": "Thirteen years after the term \"non-A, non-B\" hepatitis was first used, the HCV virus was found. A milestone in molecular virology came when HCV was cloned in 1988, years before it was visualised, cultured or even characterised. Based on its amino acid sequence and genomic organisation, HCV was classed in a separate genus in the viral family Flaviviridae. HCV is an RNA virus and has six genotypes (1-6). The main source of infection today is intravenous drug use. Transfusion-related HCV is rarely seen because of the effective screening methods in place. Unlike HBV, mother-to-infant and sexual transmission is rare. Nearly 170 million people worldwide are infected with HCV, which is now the most common reason for liver transplantation in the USA. Unlike HBV, which infrequently leads to chronic hepatitis, about 70% of those infected with HCV develop this complication. Like HBV, the hepatic damage caused by HCV is thought to be secondary to an immune response rather than a direct viral effect. In addition, age, male sex, alcohol consumption, coexistent HIV infection, low CD4 + count and metabolic disorders such as diabetes predispose to the development of liver cirrhosis and subsequently hepatocellular cancer. Like HIV, excellent serologic or DNA-based assays are available for accurate diagnosis. Quantitative RNA assays and genotyping enable predictions to be made of how an individual will respond to antiviral therapy. Treatments using interferon alpha and ribavirin are effective, particularly with HCV genotypes 2 and 3 (88% response rates compared to 48% for the other four genotypes). However, because of inadequate detection (or the money to pay for the above drugs), there is considerable concern that what is being seen at present is only the tip of the iceberg since the virus has a long incubation period, and many who are carriers remain asymptomatic until complications develop.",
