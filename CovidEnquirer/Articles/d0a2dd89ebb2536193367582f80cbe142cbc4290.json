Methods: This was a single-center simulation study performed from December 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016. Each participant underwent quantitative fit test (QNFT) of N95 respirators according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration protocol. Adequacy of respirator fit was represented by the fit factor (FF), which is calculated as the number of ambient particles divided by the number inside the respirator. We divided all participants into the group that passed the overall fit test but failed at least one individual exercise (partially passed group [PPG]) and the group that passed all exercises (all passed group [APG]). Then, the participants performed three sessions of continuous chest compressions, each with a duration of 2 min, while undergoing real-time fit testing. The primary outcome was any failure (FF < 100) of the fit test during the three bouts of chest compression. Results: Forty-four participants passed the QNFT. Overall, 73% (n = 32) of the participants failed at least one of the three sessions of chest compression; the number of participants who failed was significantly higher in the PPG than in the APG (94% vs. 61%; p = 0.02). Approximately 18% (n = 8) of the participants experienced mask fit failures, such as strap slipping. Conclusions: Even if the participants passed the QNFT, the N95 respirator did not provide adequate protection against respiratory infections during chest compression.",

In 2015, a large outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection occurred after exposure to a single patient in an overcrowded ED of a hospital in South Korea; several individuals, including healthcare workers (HCWs), were infected [3, 4] . The World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HCWs must use a particulate filtering facepiece respirator that is at least as protective as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)certified N95 filtering facepiece respirator (N95 respirator) or its equivalent when treating patients with airborne infectious diseases [5, 6] . However, such facepiece respirators can provide protection only when the face seal fits tightly. Therefore, fit testing is essential; a qualitative or quantitative approach must be used to identify respirators that best suit each individual [7, 8] .",

Some exercises for the conventional QNFT mimic chest compression, which include bending at the waist and head up-and-down movement [9] . However, chest compression during CPR is significantly more dynamic and rapid than QNFT exercises. Therefore, it is unclear whether the protective effects of the N95 respirators will be maintained during chest compression particularly in those who failed at least one individual conventional QNFT exercise. Previously, Shin et al. have evaluated the effects of movements during chest compression on the protective performances of various N95 respirators in the simulated setting [13] . They demonstrated that the FFs of certain respirators decreased during chest compression, thereby seriously compromising respiratory performance.",

However, previous studies have Data were presented as median with interquartile range or n (%). One retrospective cohort study has reported that one of nine HCWs who participated in cardiac compression developed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [25] . Of the six HCWs who performed CPR on a patient with MERS, one acquired the infection [11] . Experiences from the outbreaks of highly contagious diseases, such as SARS and MERS, taught us that HCWs should be protected from airborne disease transmission when performing CPR [11, 12, 26, 27] . The current international CPR guidelines do not address the extent of airway protection required by HCWs when performing CPR on patients with suspected or confirmed airborne diseases [22] . Infection-prevention strategies for HCWs tend to take second place in life-threatening situations requiring minimization of noflow time [11, 12] . However, the safety of HCWs is in fact paramount. Mechanical compression devices can be used to minimize HCW participation in CPR. In addition, HCWs engaging in chest compression of patients with airborne diseases could wear powered air-purifying respirators with hoods (PAPRs) rather than N95 respirators. However, this may result in resuscitation difficulties, and both movement and communication are compromised [28, 29] . In addition, the protective effects of PAPRs during chest compression have not been explored, and further studies are warranted.",

However, we worked in a simulation laboratory, and the outcomes of the present study might differ from those of real-world settings. The participants performed continuous chest compression based on the assumption that the patient had an advanced airway. However, in patients without an advanced airway, chest compressions are briefly paused to provide ventilation [16] . CPR is complex, featuring chest compression, endotracheal intubation, defibrillation, bag-valve ventilation, intravenous line insertion, and drug administration. However, we focused on chest compression only. If the participants carried out other tasks, then the outcomes might have differed. In addition, in the present study, the participants were instructed not to talk as much as possible. We believed that such action was reasonable when providing CPR to patients with air-borne disease. However, HCWs need to talk for communication in real settings, which can loosen the fitting of the N95 respirator. Second, we had only three respirator types available; thus, our results cannot be generalized to other models. Third, although chest compression lasted for 2 min, the FF was obtained after excluding data from the first 20 s because the time was used for ambient purge, ambient sample, and mask purge.",
