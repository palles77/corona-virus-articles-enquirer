The chemical structures of numerous xanthanolides are well documented, though much more is known of the biological data of the extracts than of their synthetic preparation. In general, the xanthanolides present a gbutirolactone fused to a seven-membered ring. Depending of this fusion, the xanthanolides can be divided into two structural types: the cis-(8-epi-xanthatin, xanthanolide numbering) and the transfused lactones (Fig. 1 ). Xanthatin (2) was first isolated from Xanthium pennsylvanicum by J. E. Little and co-workers [14] and its structure was established by Geissman et al. [4, 15] . The latter group suggested the possibility that xanthatin could be formed from xanthinin by dehydration during isolation, particularly during purification by column chromatography. The first total synthesis of a xanthanolide, specifically (\u00c0)-dihydroxanthatin, was reported by Morken with sequential ruthenium-catalysed metathesis reactions [16] . Recently, Shishido and co-workers reported the enantiocontrolled total synthesis of (\u00c0)-xanthatin from an optically pure bicyclic lactone [17] .",

The vasculature density is correlated with the malignancy and aggressiveness of tumor. Angiogenesis favours the growth of solid tumors as well as their invasion and metastasis [30, 31] . Clinical results for the first generation of anti-angiogenic drugs demonstrated no additional clinical benefit compared with the classic antitumor treatments. Consequently, more research will be needed to obtain more promising angiogenesis inhibitors. The rat aortic ring explants model in three-dimensional collagen gel matrixes and the HUVEC capillary tube formation assay on a Matrigel synthetic basement membrane matrix are commonly used in vitro angiogenesis systems. The anti-angiogenic response to xanthatin was evaluated in vitro in rat aorta ring explant cultures over 14-days in the presence of exogenous VEGF stimulation. Doserelated inhibitory effects on microvessel growth were observed from 0.03 mM to 10 mM (Fig. 4) and 0.3 nM to 3 mM xanthatin (Fig. 5) .",

This anti-angiogenic response was comparable to the effect of paclitaxel (IC 50 \u00bc 0.002 mM) which is considered to be one of the best antiangiogenic drugs. Xanthatin and paclitaxel showed similar behaviour. Thus, the anti-angiogenic effects of xanthatin and paclitaxel prevailed at low doses, while at high doses both showed cytotoxic activity. Moreover, the inhibition of angiogenesis is not dosedependent for either compound. The inhibition of angiogenesis has not previously been studied either for xanthatin or for xanthium extract, and these properties could be used in the treatment of solid tumor.",
