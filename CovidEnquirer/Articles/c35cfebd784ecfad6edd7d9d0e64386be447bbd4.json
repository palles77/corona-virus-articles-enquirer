Aloe-emodin showed low cytotoxicity to human HL-CZ promonocyte cells and TE-671 medulloblastoma cells and significantly activated interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and gamma-activated sequence (GAS)-driven cis-reporting systems. Moreover, aloe-emodin upregulated expression of IFN-stimulated genes such as dsRNA-activated protein kinase and 2 ,5 -oligoisoadenylate synthase. Aloe-emodin resulted in significant activation of nitric oxide production. The antiviral activity of aloe-emodin against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) was evaluated using dose-and time-dependent plaque reduction assays in HL-CZ cells and TE-671 cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of aloe-emodin ranged from 0.50 g/mL to 1.51 g/mL for JEV and from 0.14 g/mL to 0.52 g/mL for EV71. Aloe-emodin showed clearly potent virus inhibitory abilities and achieved high therapeutic indices, in particular for HL-CZ cells. Therefore, the study demonstrated dose-and time-dependent actions of aloe-emodin on the inhibition of JEV and EV71 replication via IFN signalling responses.",

IFN\u2423 and IFN\u2424 show a therapeutic effect on viral infections, including coxsackievirus type A16 [5] and West Nile virus (WNV) [6] . IFN\u2425 is involved in the activation of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) to inhibit viral replication in the macrophage and the central nervous system (CNS) [7] . Importantly, polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a potent IFN-inducer, has been demonstrated to improve the survival rate and to decrease tissue viral titres following enterovirus 71 (EV71) and WNV challenge in mice [6, 8] . Therefore, screening for IFN-inducers from the compounds of Chinese herbal medicine is an alternative approach to identify potent antiviral agents. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and EV71 are neurotropic viruses that spread particularly in the Asia-Pacific region [9, 10] . JEV and EV71 encephalitis are inflammatory diseases of the CNS, like poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. JEV and EV71 multiply in primary sites such as monocytes and myeloid and lymphoid cells and then travel from the periphery to the CNS [9, 10] . The antiviral approach against JEV and EV71 could be simultaneously set up in the same cell lines.",

The anti-JEV mechanism of shikonin was not clearly found to be associated with activation of in vivo ISRE, GAS and NF-B signalling pathways (Fig. 1B) . However, shikonin (1 g/mL) increased levels of PKR and OAS in HL-CZ cells by 1087-and 5-fold, respectively, compared with mock cells. Shikonin was hypothesised to be an effective inhibitor of protein-protein interactions with multiple targets in both the intracellular and extracellular compartments owing to several therapeutic applications [13] . Therefore, we suggest that the mechanism of anti-JEV activity of shikonin could involve multiple targets for anti-JEV activity. Arecoline, a major areca nut alkaloid, showed less anti-JEV efficacy than aloe-emodin and shikonin (Table 1 ). Arecoline has been demonstrated to activate the GAS signalling pathway (Fig. 1B) and to enhance NO production.
