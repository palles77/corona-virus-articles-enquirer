We described the viral detection profile and its association with clinical characteristics in children admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic. Method: Longitudinal observational retrospective study, with patients aged 0-18 years, admitted to 11 PICUs in Rio de Janeiro, with suspected H1N1 infection, from June to November, 2009. The results of respiratory samples which were sent to the Laboratory of Fiocruz/RJ and clinical data extracted from specific forms were analyzed. Results: Of 71 samples, 38% tested positive for H1N1 virus. Of the 63 samples tested for other viruses, 58 were positive: influenza H1N1 (43.1% of positive samples), rhinovirus/enterovirus (41.4%), respiratory syncytial v\u00edrus (12.1%), human metapneumovirus (12.1%), adenovirus",

The H1N1-positive subgroup presented a higher frequency of fever, cough and tachypnea and lower leukocyte count when compared to the H1N1-negative subgroup. Cough is a characteristic of H1N1 infection, [21] [22] [23] as well as leukopenia. 9 In Taiwan, leukopenia was found in 64.2% of cases and was more frequent in H1N1positive. 22 During the 2009 pandemic, H1N1 was more frequent in young adults and in children younger than five years of age. 6, [24] [25] [26] In addition, the incidence of SARI for H1N1 was higher in children younger than two years 24 and this group was included as a priority in the first vaccination campaigns in Brazil. 13 This phenomenon can be explained by the high susceptibility of children to H1N1, a virus with a high potential for transmission and completely new to the pediatric population, who had no antibodies with cross-reactivity. 27, 28 In our study, however, H1N1-positive children were older than the H1N1-negative children. Although this may have been only an effect of the small sample size, other studies have found similar results. 6, 21, 29 The main hypothesis raised by some of these authors is that the presence of previous acquired nonprotective antibodies in older children and young adults might lead to a cross-reaction with the H1N1 virus, which could lead to immunecomplex formation and severe lung disease. 29 Smaller children would have a less robust immune response to H1N1 virus, preventing progression to immune-mediated lung disease. 21 Another possible explanation would be an earlier and more aggressive treatment in younger children, because they are a risk group. 21 In our study, chest X-ray imaging showed diffuse infiltrates in 52.8% of the cases and alveolar consolidations in 43.4%, which is consistent with previously published studies. 4 We observed a high case fatality rate of 15.5%, possibly related to the severity of illness in our study population, which is comparable to literature data. A fatality rate of 18.6% was found in a German study with a similar population of PICUadmitted children during the pandemic period. 20 In Porto Alegre, Brazil, 10 a fatality rate of 9.1% was described among younger hospitalized children.",

Some studies call attention to specific codetections associated with worse prognosis. 29, 30 We compared the H1N1-positive and negative groups, as well as the nonspecific viral codetection and mono-dectection groups in relation to severity outcomes. We found no association between these outcomes and the presence of H1N1 or nonspecific viral codetection in respiratory secretions, but our small sample size may have influenced the strength of causal association. In other Brazilian studies carried out during the pandemic, the authors found an association of viral codetection with hospitalization 9 and mechanical ventilation. 10 In Ohio, patients coinfected with rhinovirus tended to present a less severe clinical picture than those coinfected with other viruses. 7 Data from epidemiological reports in Brazil [31] [32] [33] and studies in other countries 3, 34, 35 showed that, in the post-pandemic period, H1N1 virus continues to circulate and cause SARI and deaths. The influenza virus continues to mutate and frequently re-appears in variant forms. In March 2013, the influenza A(H7N9) virus circulated mainly in China causing serious illness. 36 In November 2015, there was one human case of influenza A(H1N2) in Brazil. 33 The threat of new pandemics is a reality and continuing surveillance is essential.",
