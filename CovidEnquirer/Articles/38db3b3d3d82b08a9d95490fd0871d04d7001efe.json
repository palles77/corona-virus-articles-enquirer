These would impose considerable burden to the healthcare system. 10 The substantial impact of children and adolescent falls to the society can be reflected by the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. Globally, falls have been reported as the 13th most common cause of DALYs lost, of which children and adolescents accounted for over 50% of the fall-related DALYs lost. 11 Given the high prevalence and substantial adverse effects of falls among children and adolescents, more efforts should focus on Strengths and limitations of this study \u25aa To authors' knowledge, this is the very first study on paediatric fall patterns using fracture and non-fracture categorisation. \u25aa This study captures the changes of the injury pattern of falls with respect to time and serves as an indicator for the establishment of fall prevention programmes in children and adolescents. \u25aa This study captures all accident and emergency department (AED) attendances in all public hospitals due to fall injuries in Hong Kong, which covers >85% of the related AED attendances. \u25aa The study may underestimate the incidence of fall injury in the population as only the AED figures were available. \u25aa As the detailed mechanisms of fall remain unknown, further research such as case studies should be conducted in order to elucidate the mechanisms.",

Hence, it is necessary to explore the mechanisms and potential factors that contribute to fall-related injury risks during childhood in order to inform the prevention programme design and implementation. Falls have been identified as the most common cause of attendances to the accident and emergency department (AED) among all childhood injuries. 12 Data on AED attendances and hospitalisation serve as key indicators to reflect on the severity and pattern of fall-related injuries. As hospital care represents the most expensive component of a healthcare system, 13 making use of these information can help to identify the actual burden for different types of fall-related injuries caused in terms of the frequency of AED visit and the length of stay (LOS) in hospital admission. Moreover, data sources such as death registry can provide insightful information on the pattern of mortality causes. Hospitalisation data, together with the detailed code of diagnosis, have also been recognised as important information for assessing fall-related injuries. 14 15 Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of AED attendances and hospitalisation data in quantifying the burden of fall-related injuries. 13 16-18 However, many of these studies mainly focused on fall injuries among older adults or specific occupational groups. There were only few studies examining the fall-related injuries among adolescents and children, as well as the burden caused by different types of fall-related injuries to the healthcare system. This study therefore aimed to examine the trends and characteristics of fall-related AED attendance by injury type and the associated hospitalisation among children and adolescents in Hong Kong.",

For instance, based on ICD-9 codes, the fall-related fractures have been grouped into the fracture of hip (820), fracture of femur (821), upper extremity fractures (fractures of shoulder/upper arm (810-812), forearm/elbow (813), wrist/hand (814-817)), lower extremity fractures (fracture of lower leg/knee (822-823), ankle/foot (824-826)) and central fractures (fractures of skull/face (800-804), neck/trunk (805-809)).

Such decrements in AED admission have also been observed worldwide during these outbreaks. 21 During the outbreak of highly infectious and fatal diseases, AED became a comparatively high-risk place due to the admissions of newly infected patients. We suspect that although more severe patients with fracture injury would still attend AED for medical care services given no other alternatives for treatments, less severe patients with non-fracture injury would avoid attending AED for treatment during the disease outbreak due to their fear of being infected. 22 When we broke down the overall fall-related attendance into inpatient admissions and discharge cases (table 3), it was observed that the number of admissions to inpatient care unit was dropping in both groups while the immediate discharge cases were on the rising trend across the years. The increase in the overall attendance number was driven by drastic increments in immediate discharged cases in fracture and non-fracture groups. The increase in the overall attendance was driven by drastic increments in immediate discharged cases in fracture and non-fracture groups, which could be related the health seeking behaviour of the children's carer. As shown in previous studies, accessibility, convenience, 23 high availability 24 and confidence in the emergency care are all potential factors that could have driven the increasing number in attendance. Moreover, guardians/carers might sometimes overestimate the severity of their children's injuries, 25 causing unnecessary usage of the AED services. This may require a structural change in the resource usage of AED for falls since increasing effort was put for treatment of mild cases. Owing to the fact that overcrowding was a problem to emergency departments in Hong Kong, 20 administrative measures such as providing more community care, primary care, community education and change in the admission criteria may relieve possible inappropriate usage of AED services. 26 27 Nonetheless, the boom in non-fracture attendance could be explained by the enhanced awareness of the parents on the safety of their children or improvements in the reputation of AED.",

            "text": "Previous research found that the most common type of fall which results in hospitalisation among 10-year olds or younger was falling from one level to another, including falling from playground equipment, beds, tables and chairs. On the contrary, patients aged 10-19 were frequently injured because of falling on the same level instead, either slipping or having collisions with others. 13 In our study, while the rate of nonfracture injury admissions in all body regions increased significantly, ankle and foot injuries had the highest annual percentage change followed by wrist and hand injuries. Head injuries had the highest proportion accounting for the number of fall injury attendance in the non-fracture injuries. It escalated to about 1.6 times of its initial value over the 12-year study period. However, such escalation could be accounted by a pure increase in head incidence or an improvement in diagnostic process. Research showed that young children having minor head injuries had low risk to coincide with clinically significant traumatic brain injury. 28 Our results, as compared with a previous study, suggested that non-fractures appeared most frequently on head consistently among the young and the elderly (aged 65+). Yet, these two groups of people were different in the pattern of fracture-injured body region; the children and adolescents were most commonly injured with fractures on their upper extremity, while fractures on hips were the most common among the elderly. 16 The explanation may lie on the differences in the falling mechanisms and the response time to accidents with respect to children and the elderly. Wrist fractures are usually associated with falling forward or backward with an outstretched hand while hip fractures are often due to falls to the side. 29 It was suggested that wrist fractures are more common than hip fractures between ages 65 and 75. However, hip fractures become predominate in ages 75+, probably because of slowed reflexes and loss of ability to protect their hips with their hands. 30 When fall occurs, the younger individuals have more available response time than the elderly, and hence they can sufficiently use their hand to land on the ground to protect their hips and prevent their heads from damages. 31 32 Therefore, it is most likely to see that the fracture appeared on the parts of the upper extremity of children and adolescents. Figure 4 demonstrates the trend of the average LOS of hospitalised patients with fall-related attendance. It reflects that the injuries among fracture group are more severe than non-fracture group, and fracture cases impose a heavier burden on the healthcare system. Moreover, a stable trend in severity of injuries has been observed, as reflected by the average LOS. However, there might be other influential factors such as the administrative policies of hospitals that would certainly alter the LOS of patients.",

Third, we adopted LOS as a proxy for severity of injury which has been criticised for its instability in estimating the injury severity as compared with other standardised scores. However, LOS is a readily available statistic that can be easily understood by general public and LOS can reflect the potential improvements of medical treatments and policy changes in hospital for inpatients over time, which are of interest in our study.
