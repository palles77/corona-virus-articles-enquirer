Those functional properties are of the highest importance, giving noticeable improvements in the wear comfort and care. This chapter discusses various functional properties -for example, anti-microbial, easy-care, ultravioletprotecting and flame-retardant finishes that could be achieved by the application of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles. In addition, novel applications of textile materials using nanotechnology in biological detection, decomposition of toxic gases, self-decontamination and military protection gear are discussed.",

            "text": "Nanotechnology deals with materials having at least one dimension in the nanometre scale, and includes nanoparticles, nanorods, nanowires, thin films and bulk materials made of nanoscale building structures (Cao, 2004) . A nanometre (nm) is one billionth of a metre, or 10 -9 m. Nanotechnology is not simply the continuation of miniaturization from micrometre scale down to nanometre scale but also permits entirely different and improved functionalities. For example, crystals in the nanometre scale have a low melting point, reduced lattice constants, higher surface area and catalytic activity. The band gap of semiconductors can be engineered by varying their size in the nanometre range while superparamagnetism will be observed in the case of magnetic materials. In the United States, nanotechnology has been defined as being 'concerned with materials and systems whose structures and components exhibit novel and significantly improved physical, chemical and biological properties, phenomena and processes due to their nanoscale size' (National Nanotechnology Initiative, 2000, www.nano.gov) . Although nanotechnology is new, research in biology and colloidal science has been at a nanometre scale for centuries. The current enthusiasm for nanotechnology is driven by the availability of characterization and manipulation techniques at nanometre level and the continued shrinking of devices in the semiconductor industry, as predicted by Moore's law.",

            "text": "The two common methods of preventing the formation of agglomerates are electrostatic stabilization (due to surface charge density) and steric stabilization (due to polymeric coating). The frequently used stabilizers are poly(vinyl pyrrolidone), polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate, polyethyleneimine, sodium polyphosphate, starch, gelatine and proteins. There are two main approaches for the synthesis and/or fabrication of nanostructures: top-down and bottom-up. Milling and colloidal dispersion are typical examples of top-down and bottom-up methods, respectively. The bottomup approach promises a better chance of obtaining nanostructures with fewer defects and more homogeneous chemical composition, as it is mainly driven by the reduction of Gibbs free energy leading to a state closer to thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, the top-down approach is more likely to introduce internal stress, in addition to surface defects and contaminations (Cao, 2004) . A schematic representation of the top-down and bottom-up approaches for the synthesis of nanomaterials is given in Fig. 8 uniform size distribution, identical shape and chemical composition and complete dispersion contribute largely to the quality of the final product. Figure 8 .2 shows the completely dispersed silver nanoparticles prepared in our laboratory. In general, nanocrystals refer to single crystalline nanoparticles and quantum dots refer to sufficiently small nanoparticles exhibiting quantum effects (in semiconductors) and surface plasmon resonance (in metals). The synthesis of metal nanoparticles, usually called colloids, can be traced back to Michael Faraday in the mid nineteenth century. Even today it is a very convenient procedure to generate gold colloids by Faraday's method using the reduction of [AuCl 4 ]by citric acid. The particles formed are surrounded by an electric double layer arising from adsorbed citrate and chloride ions and by the corresponding cations. The resulting Coulomb repulsion between the particles prevents aggregation and coalescence. Figure 8 .3 illustrates the situation between two particles having electric double layers. The Coulomb repulsion between the particles decays approximately exponentially with the particle distance (Bradley, 1994) . Porel et al. (2007) demonstrated the synthesis of silver nanoparticles by the 8.3 Electrostatic stabilization of metal colloids. Van der Waals attraction and electrostatic repulsion compete with each other.

Condensation results in the formation of nanoscale clusters of metal oxides, often with organic groups embedded or attached to them. Wang et al.

It is a well-known fact that the growth of bacteria and microorganisms in food or water is prevented when stored in silver vessels owing to the antibacterial properties of silver, which are now scientifically recognized. Silver ions have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activities. They are believed to get bound to protein molecules, inhibiting the cellular metabolism and leading to the termination of the growth of microorganisms. An additional benefit to the use of metal nanoparticles is the presence of surface plasmons. These plasmons have strong optical extinctions that can be tuned to different colours by varying their size and shape. Silver nanoparticles can be used to create a shiny metallic yellow to dark pink colour while simultaneously imparting antibacterial properties to the textile materials. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the biocidal action of this nanoscale material (Sondi and Salopek-Sondi, 2004) . The results confirmed that the treated Escherichia coli cells were damaged, showing the formation of 'pits' in the cell wall of the bacteria, while the silver nanoparticles were found to accumulate in the bacterial membrane. A membrane with such morphology exhibits a significant increase in permeability, resulting in death of the cell. On account of its non-toxic nature, nano-silver is biocompatible and can be used effectively to reduce bacterial counts on nonwoven materials such as air and water filters, medical clothing and textile woven fabrics that come into direct contact with human skin (Tiller et al., 2001) . In our earlier report (Vigneshwaran et al., 2007) , we reported on a novel, one-pot synthetic route for the preparation of silver nanoparticles, reduced and stabilized by starch on the surface of cotton fabrics. Thus-formed nanoparticles impart colour to the fabrics owing to the surface plasmon resonance.

The UV-blocking properties of a fabric are enhanced when a dye, pigment, delustrant or UV-absorbant finish is present that absorbs UV radiation and blocks its transmission through the fabric to the skin (Hustvedt and Crews, 2005) . Metal oxides such as ZnO are more stable as UV blockers when compared with organic UV-blocking agents. Hence, the nano-form of ZnO will really enhance UV-blocking properties due to the increased surface area and intense absorption in the UV region. Our research (Vigneshwaran et al., 2006) has indicated excellent antibacterial activity against two representative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and promising protection against UV radiation for the nano-ZnO-impregnated cotton textiles.

The loss and changes resulting from the detergent solution and the abrasive action of five typical hand launderings are roughly approximated by this 45 min test.

If the critical surface tension of the solid is less than surface tension of the liquid, the fabric will repel the liquid. In the case of solids 'critical surface tension' is used instead of 'surface tension'. Thus, water repellency can be attained when the critical surface tension of the solid is smaller than surface tension of the liquid. For example, when a drop of water is dripped on a cotton fabric, it has been experimentally determined that the surface tension of water and the critical surface tension of cotton are, respectively, 72 dyne/cm and 200 dyne/cm, and, therefore, water readily wets the cotton fibre. However, once the cotton is treated with a fluorocarbon the water-repellency relation between them changes. The critical surface tension of water-repellentfinished cotton is less than the surface tension of water. Fluorocarbons are organic compounds consisting perfluorinated carbon chain. They tend to decrease the surface tension of the substrate (Zabicky, 2006). The self-cleaning of super-hydrophobic micro-to nanostructured surfaces was observed to be a property of some plants -one of which is nasturtiums (Tropaeolum sp.). In 1975, the researcher Wilhelm Barthlott, then at the University of Heidelberg, elucidated this phenomenon. Only at the beginning of the 1990s was it possible for W. Barthlott, and his collaborator Christoph Neinhuis (later Zdenek Cerman and others) to harness this physico-chemical phenomenon technically. Barthlott coined the trade name Lotus-Effect\u00ae for the patented self-cleaning super-hydrophobic micro-to nanostructured products and copyrighted it in 1997 (http://www.lotuseffekt.de/en/faq/index.php). Over millions of years of evolution nature has developed surfaces -the ideal example being the leaves of the lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) -which, through a complicated micro-to nano-scale surface structure, repel dirt (see Fig. 8 .8). The surfaces concerned are those that, owing to their chemistry, are water repellent (hydrophobic). These particular properties, however, are not only determined by the chemistry but also, in particular, the micro-to nanostructure: in the ideal case this is composed of a bulky structure (5-10 \u00b5m in diameter) and a fine structure (10 nm to 5 \u00b5m) layered on top. Adhesion of particles to these surfaces is minimal because they touch only the tips of the surface 8.8 Scanning electron micrograph of lotus leaf.",

Therefore, in addition to metal and metal oxide nanomaterials, nanoscale biological materials such as enzymes and drugs are necessary to add specific functionality to medical textiles (Petrulyte, 2008) . Specialized nanomaterials functionalized with ligands can be introduced on the surface of cotton textiles with the aim of absorbing odours, providing strong and durable antibacterial properties, easing pain and relieving irritation. In addition, such value-added textiles could be of immense use in tissue engineering, drug delivery and protective clothing. Nyacol\u00ae Nano-technologies Inc. has been the world's leading supplier of colloidal antimony pentoxide which is used for flame-retardant finishes on textiles. It supplies colloidal antimony pentoxide as a fine particle dispersion for use as a flame-retardant synergist with halogenated flame retardants. The ratio of halogen to antimony ranges from 5:1 to 2:1. Green-shield\u00ae, a nanotech firm from Taiwan, has created an underwear that aims to eliminate odour. The underwear textile material releases undetectable negative ions and infrared rays that destroy the odour-causing bacteria; also, the far-infrared rays are absorbed by cells causing all the individual atoms to vibrate at a higher frequency, which speeds up the 8.12 Design and electricity-generating mechanism of the fibre-based nanogenerator driven by a low-frequency, external pulling force. (a) Schematic of the experimental set-up of the fibre-based nanogenerator. (b) An optical micrograph of a pair of entangled fibres, one of which is coated with Au (in darker contrast). (c) SEM image at the 'teeth-to-teeth' interface of two fibres covered by nanowires (NWs), with the top one coated with Au. The Au-coated nanowires at the top serve as the conductive 'tips' that deflect/bend the nanowires at the bottom. (d) Schematic illustration of the teeth-to-teeth contact between the two fibres covered by nanowires. (e) The piezoelectric potential created across nanowires I and II under the pulling of the top fibre by an external force. The side with positive piezoelectric potential does not allow the flow of current owing to the existence of a reverse-biased Schottky barrier. Once the nanowire is pushed to bend far enough to reach the other Au-coated nanowire, electrons in the external circuit will be driven to flow through the uncoated nanowire due to the forward-biased Schottky barrier at the interface. (f) When the top fibre is further pulled, the Au-coated nanowires may scrub across the uncoated nanowires. Once the two types of nanowires are in final contact, at the last moment, the interface is a forward-biased Schottky, resulting in further output of electric current, as indicated by arrowheads. The output current is the sum of all the contributions from all of the nanowires, while the output voltage is determined by one nanowire. Recently, a simple, low-cost approach has been reported (Qin et al., 2008) that converts low-frequency vibration/friction energy into electricity using piezoelectric zinc oxide nanowires grown radially around textile fibres. By entangling two fibres and brushing the nanowires rooted on them with respect to each other, mechanical energy is converted into electricity owing to a coupled piezoelectricsemiconductor process. This work establishes a methodology for scavenging light-wind energy and body-movement energy using fabrics. Figure 8 .12 shows the design and electricity-generating mechanism of the fibre-based nanogenerator driven by a low-frequency, external pulling force.",

With increased performance comes added value and additional revenue. One company to realize this has been the Burlington Industries subsidiary, Nano-Tex. Branded as one of the 'coolest' products in 2003 by Time Magazine, Nano-Tex is providing clothing manufacturers such as Levi's, Eddie Bauer, Gap and Old Navy the means to make their products more durable, more water and oil repellent, and more stain resistant, while also reducing the need for washing -all without altering the feel of the fabric. Nano-Tex's chemical formulation and application technology, which is easily adopted by existing textile mills, changes the fabric itself on a molecular level, embedding it with tiny, floppy, hair-like fibres that themselves are attached to a common spine. The 'nanowhiskers' in the chemical mix prevent stains from soaking into clothing. Nano-Tex is said to have plans to expand its product range to include stain-proof mattresses, boat covers and hotel bedding. Looking at the previously stated definition of nanotechnology it could be argued that Nano-Tex's technology is not really nanotechnology but improved chemistry; however the company is realizing a profit while other 'proper' nanotechnology companies are still waiting and dreaming.",

This technology is named 'NanoMATRIX', in which a functional nanoscale material coating is applied to each of the monofilaments that forms a woven or knitted fabric. Application of this technology is expected to lead to the development of new functionalities, the creation of complex functionalities, remarkable improvements in the existing functions (quality, durability, etc.) and expansion of usage in terms of materials/applications without losing the fabric's texture.",

The silver nanoparticles in the effluent from a cotton nanofinishing process could be removed efficiently by the use of Chromobacterium violaceum (Duran et al., 2007) , which is able to absorb, metabolize or store metal ions, and thus environmental damage will be avoided. With the onset of the Industrial Revolution, concerns relating to public health and safety and the environment have resulted in increasingly stringent environmental regulations (Theodore, 2006) . Hence, there is a need for the development of fully-fledged norms and regulations for the use of nanomaterials and their disposal in the environment. In the case of textiles, it will be of great concern that both the finished product and the effluent will comply with these regulations. Since textile products have the closest interaction with our body, they must be evaluated for their toxicology and tolerance levels.",
