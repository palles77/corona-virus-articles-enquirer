They then engineered haemagglutinin so that it was less pathogenic and mixed plasmids carrying these two fragments with six plasmids carrying the remaining flu genome fragments from H1N1, a standard vaccine strain (Fig. 1) .",

' Speed is only one aspect of this revolution. Even more important is the flexibility that is now available for vaccine design [3] . For example, says Kawaoka, 'many companies are planning to use reverse genetics to produce attenuated flu strains to be used as live vaccines that should give more protection than current inactivated vaccines'. In other cases, says Rappuoli, 'this technology has facilitated the development of previously elusive vaccines. For example, for 50 years we failed to develop an effective vaccine for meningococcus B. With reverse genetics we went from getting its genome sequence through identifying new antigens to starting clinical vaccine trials in less than four years.'",
