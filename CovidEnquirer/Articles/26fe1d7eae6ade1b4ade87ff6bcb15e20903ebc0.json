Fluorescence is always confined to the cytoplasm. Within 24 h, fine fibrils appear, usually parallel to the long axis of the cell, and cytoplasmic granules are formed around the nucleus (Rossi and Kiesel, 1977b) . After 24 h, coincident with rounding of the cells, fluorescence slowly moves to the periphery of the cytoplasm. By IF and as determined by the release of BRSV into the supernatant fluid, the minimal time for a single cycle of infection was between 24 and 26 h (Rossi and Kiesel, 1977b) .",

(1975) . However, the protective effect of nasal neutralizing antibodies against infection with BRSV has been shown by Mohanty (1978) . This author found that young calves with traces of neutralizing antibodies in the nasal secretions remained solidly immune to challenge. The quick appearance and the pathogenic action of BRSV on the nasal mucosa would indicate that the nasal cavity might be the point of departure to the target cells; Baskerville (1981) disagrees with this hypothesis. BRSV is unable to suppress ciliary activity, even though the virus replicates within ciliated epithelial cells of tracheal rings. It was therefore suggested that the tracheal epithelium may not be important in the pathogenesis of BRSV infection (Thomas et al., 1976; Rossi and Kiesel, 1977a) .",
