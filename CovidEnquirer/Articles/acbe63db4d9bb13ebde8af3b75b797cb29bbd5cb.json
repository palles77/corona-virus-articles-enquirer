In this study, the hemagglutination (HA) abilities of two PDCoV strains (CH-01 and HNZK-04) were investigated. Our results showed that PDCoV has the ability to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes after virion pretreatment with trypsin or neuraminidase. Additionally, the HA assay results showed a significant positive correlation with the infectious viral titer. Our results suggest that assessing the HA activity of PDCoV may be a useful diagnostic method for investigating and surveilling PDCoV infections.",

PDCoV was first identified in pigs in Hong Kong in 2012, while the first PDCoV outbreak in swine herds was reported in the United States in 2014 [3] . Subsequently, PDCoV was detected in Canada, South Korea, mainland China, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam, indicating that it is widespread among the world's pig populations; moreover, PDCoV can have devastating effects on the swine industry [4] .

            "text": "Similarly, IBV [11] and PEDV showed no HA activity in the absence of trypsin or neuraminidase treatment, and trypsin-treated TGEV [6, 12] also showed HA activity. These observations suggest that trypsin or neuraminidase can successfully elicit HA activity and agglutinate erythrocytes. IBV, TGEV and PEDV agglutinate erythrocytes by using \u03b1 2,3-linked sialic acid on the cell surface as a binding site [10, 13] clinical swine serum (verified to be PDCoV-positive by ELISA) was detected by HI testing. Our investigation showed that PDCoV-positive serum could inhibit the agglutinating ability of the virus, suggesting that sera from such swine have been exposed to or infected with PDCoV.",

In addition, the HA activity could be blocked when the erythrocytes were treated with trypsin or neuraminidase. This phenomenon was similar to those reported for TGEV, PEDV, and IBV. Our research provides new information on the investigation of PDCoV biological characteristics. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of PDCoV HA activity.",

Our results showed that pretreatment of erythrocytes with trypsin or neuraminidase made the cells resistant to agglutination by PDCoV, indicating that sialic acid was a crucial component of the erythrocyte receptors for viral binding. Thus, we speculate that PDCoV has a sialic acid-binding activity that enables the virus to agglutinate erythrocytes. Further studies are needed to verify this suggestion.The growth curve of PDCoV was correlated with the observed HA titers. This result indicates that the HA activity of PDCoV is associated with virus production. Inhibition of virus-specific HA can be used to measure antibody responses to virus infection.
