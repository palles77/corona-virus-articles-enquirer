            "text": "While exploring the molecular mechanisms behind the fin hemorrhages that follow zebrafish (Danio rerio) early infection with viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), we discovered that most serpin (serine protease inhibitor) gene transcripts were upregulated, except those of serpine1. Surprisingly, only SERPINe1-derived 14-mer peptide and low molecular weight drugs targeting SERPINe1 (i.e. tannic acid, EGCG, tiplaxtinin) inhibited in vitro infections not only of VHSV, but also of other fish rhabdoviruses such as infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and spring viremia carp virus (SVCV). While the mechanisms that inhibited rhabdoviral infections remain speculative, these and other results suggested that SERPINEe1-derived peptide specifically targeted viral infectivity rather than virions. Practical applications might be developed from these studies since preliminary evidences showed that tannic acid could be used to reduce VHSV-caused mortalities. These studies are an example of how the identification of host genes targeted by viral infections using microarrays might facilitate the identification of novel prevention drugs in aquaculture and illuminate viral infection mechanisms.",

Although such rhabdoviral-induced hemorrhages should include interferences with the host molecular coagulation pathways, those have not been explored yet. Therefore, we were interested in the study of transcriptional expression profiles along the coagulation-complement pathway induced by rhabdoviral early infections in the fish fins, their portal of entry [3] , with the expectation of finding novel gene targets for preventive drugs. We chose the zebrafish Danio rerio because of its susceptibility to novirhabdoviruses like viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) [4, 5] or infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), coding for non-virion NV genes and to rhabdoviruses like spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) which lack the NV gene [6, 7] . In addition, zebrafish transcriptomic data on fins and lymphoid organs have been previously reported by our research groups after immunization with VHSV [8, 9] and SVCV [10] .",

Activated THROMBIN cleaves blood FIBRINOGEN (fg) generating the fibrin clots characteristic of coagulation (Fig. 1) . The coagulation cascades are interconnected with parallel proteolytic cascades involved in complement-dependent cell lysis. Thus, the \"complement and coagulation cascades\" KEGG pathway (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/) describes two proteolytic cascades interconnected by two proteins: FACTOR XII (endothelial secreted Hageman factor, coded by the f12 gene) and PLASMINOGEN (a pro-enzyme, coded by plg). Proteolysis of FACTOR XII/PLASMINOGEN increase PLASMIN to reduce coagulation by fibrinolysis and to increase complement-dependent cell lysis (Fig. 1) . To avoid tissue damage, excessive proteolysis are controlled by a variety of protein inhibitors (i.e.: coded by serpind1, serpinc1, serpina1, serpinf2, serping1, serpine1, proc, tfpia, h, clu, etc). Among them, serine protease inhibitors (SERPIN proteins) could be grouped in those inhibiting, i) Coagulation by targeting THROMBIN coded by the f2 gene (SERPINd1, SERPINc1, SERPINa1); ii) Both coagulation and complement-dependent cell lysis by targeting TISSUE PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR, coded by tpa or plaub (SER-PINa1, SERPINe1) and/or PLASMIN (SERPINa1, SERPINf2); and iii) Complement-dependent cell lysis by targeting C1S/C1R, coded by c1s/c1r (SERPINg1) (Fig. 1, red) .",

Because the lack of modulation (up or downregulation) of serpine1 could be explained by SERPINe1 interferences with VHSV infection, we then studied the effects of SERPIN specific inhibition on in vitro rhabdoviral infections. As demonstrated for human SERPINs [11, 12] , to specifically inhibit zebrafish SERPIN activities, we used the orthologous 14-mer amino-terminal amino acids of its Reactive Center Loops (RCL) ( NH2 P14.P13.P12\u2026P3.P2.P1\u2026P'1.P'2.P'3\u2026 P'12.P'13.P '14) . Surprisingly, we discovered that only zebrafish SERPINe1-derived peptides and/or their corresponding specific low molecular weight inhibitors (i.e.: tannic acid, EGCG, tiplaxtinin) [13, 14] inhibited not only VHSV but also SVCV and IHNV in vitro rhabdoviral infections and reduced zebrafish mortalities of VHSV infections. This is one novel example of how the identification of host genes targeted by viral infections using microarrays might facilitate the identification of novel prevention drugs in aquaculture and illuminate viral infection mechanisms.",

Alternatively, SERPIN-derived peptides were incubated overnight with the ZF4 monolayers, washed and rhabdovirus added the next day during 2 h at 14 C. After washing by flicking the plate and refilling with cell culture medium, rhabdovirus-infected cell monolayers were incubated overnight at 14 C before being fixed with 10% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) during 20 min and permeabilized with 0.05% Saponin, 0.01% N 3 Na in PBS during 15 min.

These published data suggested an important participation of this pathway in the early responses of zebrafish to rhabdoviral infections since fins are the portal of entry for these viruses [3] . A more detailed analysis of the corresponding gene-by-gene differential expressions in the above mentioned pathway, showed that more genes were modulated in fins (60.9%) than in lymphoid organs (17.1%) ( Table 1) .

Only serpine1 remained not modulated, in sharp contrast to the rest of serpins in the fins (Table 1, bold) . These data suggested that serpins as well as other genes coding for inhibitors in this pathway (i.e. proc, h), may be upregulated by the VHSV infection to favor viral spreading by increasing hemorrhaging and delaying complementdependent cell lysis, except serpine1. These inhibitor upregulations could be part of the general immunosuppression described during early rhabdoviral infection of zebrafish with VHSV and other rhabdoviruses [8e10].",

To inhibit SERPIN activities, we used 14-mer synthetic peptides derived from the orthologous human/zebrafish SERPIN RCL loops (Table 2) , since they demonstrated highly specific inhibition of SERPIN activities in mammals [11, 12] . Fig. 2A (black circles) shows that only the peptides derived from SERPINe1 inhibited VHSV infection in a concentration-dependent manner (50e250 mM) when peptides and VHSV were incubated before being added to the cell monolayers. The rest of the SERPIN-derived peptides did not show any inhibition compared to VHSV-infected cell monolayers in the absence of any peptide ( Fig. 2A open symbols) . Because similar results were obtained when the SERPINderived peptides were added to the cells and washed before the addition of VHSV to the cell monolayers (SERPINe1 in Fig. 2A , black rectangles), the interactions of SERPINe1 inhibitory peptides must occur inside the cells rather than with VHSV virions. On the other hand, the absence of inhibition by other SERPIN-derived peptides was not due to lower cell penetrating activities because they have higher or similar predicted cell penetrating probabilities [24] ( Table 2 ). In view that only the SERPINe1-derived peptide inhibited VHSV infection, we focused the rest of the experiments in exploring its possible practical applications. In addition, the SER-PINd1-derived peptide having no effects on VHSV-infectivity was chosen as a negative control.",

However, none of these shorter peptides inhibited VHSV-infection when tested in a similar range of molar concentrations than the 14-mer SERPINe1-derived peptide. In contrast, simultaneously assayed 14-mer SERPINe1-derived peptide inhibited VHSV-infection (not shown). These results showed that the high specificity of viral inhibition by the SERPINe1-derived peptide required at least half of the 28-mer RCL sequence. Thus, despite their lower molecular weight and therefore their higher permeability, smaller SERPINe1-derived peptides were not capable of inhibiting VHSV-infection. Because the SERPINe1-derived 14mer peptide requirement is highly specific, their inhibition of SERPINe1 cleavage is the most probable explanation for its mechanism of action, such as demonstrated before in mammals [11, 12] .",

We found that VHSV infectivity was inhibited by all the low molecular weight drug inhibitors tested at concentrations~50-fold lower than the SERPINe1-derived peptide and lower than those causing ZF4 cytotoxicity (Fig. 3) . Therefore, since both the SERPINe1-derived peptide and SERPINe1 specific drug inhibitors inhibited VHSVinfection, an unknown serine protease X needs to be inhibited by SERPINe1 for successful VHSV infectivity. Thus, when SERPINe1 was inhibited, inhibition of VHSV infectivity was observed because the protease X inactivated VHSV infectivity. While unknown SER-PINe1-targeted protease(s) X might be implicated in these mechanisms, other possible candidates are TPA, PLAUB and/or PLASMIN (Fig. 1 ). Although we have no evidences to favor any of these possibilities, PLASMIN, is a serine protease not only implicated in fibrinolysis but also in many other matrix protein breakdowns [25] , which could include some of the rhabdoviral proteins. On this respect, serpine1 knock-out mice has shown that serpine1, tpa and plg are implicated in controlling coronavirus infections in mammals [26] . However, in coronavirus [26] and in yellow fever [27] infections, serpine1 levels were upregulated contrary to what occurred in fish rhabdoviruses. We can speculate that a dramatic fighting between host and rhabdovirus could exist to control ser-pine1 transcript levels during the initial course of fish rhabdoviral infections. Thus, if serpine1 levels are downregulated, VHSV infection will be inhibited but host hemorrhages will increase. On the contrary, if serpine1 levels become upregulated to increase VHSV infection, host hemorrhages will be inhibited thus reducing the opportunities for viral spreading. During the first 2-days after infection, serpine1 transcriptional levels remained not modulated (Table 1 ) because those 2 opposite effects.",

Serpin upregulation would inhibit many of the downstream serine proteases of that pathway confirming the immunosuppressive early effects of many viral infections including fish rhabdoviruses [7,8,10,28e30] . In contrast to the rest of serpins in this work, and in contrast to its upregulation in solid tumors [31] , viral-induced hepatocarcinoma [32] , and coronavirus [26] or yellow fever [27] infections in mammals, serpine1 levels remained not modulated during fish rhabdoviral infections. To explain serpine1 not modulated levels, we hypothesized on the existence of conflicting interests of SERPINe1 with fish rhabdoviral infectivity, since highly specific inhibition of VHSV infectivity was obtained in vitro with a 14-mer peptide derived from SERPINe1 and other specific drugs but not with those peptides derived from other SERPINs. In addition, drugs targeting SERPINe1 such as tannic acid, successfully but partially reduced mortalities to rhabdoviral infections of zebrafish in vivo.

Standard deviations (<30% of the mean) were omitted for clarity. *, significantly lower percentage of infected cells than those from VHSV-infected ZF4 cell monolayers without peptide treatment at the p < 0.05 level (Student t test). targeted by fish rhabdoviral infections obtained by using expression microarrays, offered an alternative to explore possible drugs for seasonal prevention of these diseases. Further work could allow for higher reduction of VHSV infection with low molecular weight drugs in larger fish. Fig. 4 . Mortalities after VHSV infection of zebrafish treated with tannic acid by mouth or in the feed. Tannic acid described as one of the inhibitors of SERPINe1 [13] was delivered to groups of 10 zebrafish of 2.5 g per fish by mouth with a pipette or by adding it to the feed. To deliver tannic acid by mouth, 3-days before the VHSV infection, each zebrafish were given 10 ml of PBS containing 50 mg of tannic acid each day by mouth. Mock-treated fish were given 10 ml of PBS. To deliver tannic acid with the feed, 3-days before and 7-days after VHSV infection, groups of 10 zebrafish were fed daily with 20 mg of feed containing 10% of tannic acid (equivalent to 200 mg of tannic acid per fish per day). Mock-fed fish were given the same amounts of feed. All the zebrafish groups were finally infected with 10 7 ffu/ml of VHSV. Mock-infected zebrafish were incubated with cell culture medium in parallel experiments. Percentages of cumulative mortalities for each group of 10 fish and treatment were calculated by the formula, 100 x number of fish that die/10 fish. Means of cumulative percent mortalities and its standard deviations from 3 experiments per treatment were then calculated (n \u00bc 3). \u00fe, treated with a total of 60 mg of tannic acid per g of fish (by mouth) or 800 mg of tannic acid per g of fish (by feed). \u00c0, treated with PBS (by mouth) or feed without tannic acid (by feed). *, means significantly lower at the p < 0.05 level (Student t test) when compared to the PBS (by mouth) or to the feed without tannic acid (by feed) control groups.",
