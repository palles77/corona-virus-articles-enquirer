            "text": "Tourism is shaped by a wide range of factors and forces, including exogenous ones that have no direct link with the tourism sector. Natural disasters and unexpected events are prime examples of such determining factors, as they have profound effects on individuals and society, and as a result have the potential to affect tourism flows considerably. Several theoretical arguments exist why natural disasters and unexpected events could influence tourist destination choices. However, empirical research to confirm the nature and extent of impacts of disasters on tourism is lacking. To address this gap, this paper incorporates a dataset on natural and man-made disaster events into a model of international tourism flows to evaluate the effect of different types of disasters on international arrivals at the national level. Findings provide evidence that the occurrence of different types of event change tourist flows to varying degrees. Although in some cases a positive effect is estimated, in general the impacts are negative, resulting in reduced tourist arrivals following an event. Understanding the relationship between disaster events and tourism is helpful for destination managers who make critical decisions in relation to recovery, reconstruction and marketing.",

These events have formed part of the wider 'riskscape' that humans have learned to manage and live with. However, more recently the impacts of disasters have increased substantially, partly because of the exacerbating effects of climate change, but also due to the growing complexity of socio-ecological systems in a highly connected and globalized world (Becken, Mahon, Rennie, & Shakeela, 2014) . For instance, the year 2017 recorded a series of hurricanes (Harvey, Irma and Maria) in the Caribbean and a severe earthquake in Mexico, amongst other events, and these resulted in the highest incurred losses ever recorded (US$ 135 billion) (Munich, 2018) .",

The nature and extent of impacts depend on the type of shock and the resilience of the affected system (OECD, 2014) . Most disasters have profound impacts on individuals, organizations and communities, and consequently on tourism activities. The repercussions of a disaster are likely to affect tourism directly at a destination country, but indirect consequences for travel to and from the affected region are also conceivable (Jin, Qu & Bap. 2019; Ruan, Quan & Liu, 2017) . Understanding, managing and responding to these risks, therefore, has to be an integral component of sustainable tourism management (Shakeela & Becken, 2015) . Consequently, it is not surprising that the topic of risk management and disaster mitigation is attracting increasing attention in tourism research. An emerging body of literature has provided both theoretical and empirical insights into multiple aspects of disasters and tourism.",

            "text": "Research to date has largely focused on crisis management and disaster risk reduction (Becken & Hughey, 2013; Faulkner, 2001; Ritchie, 2008) . In particular, academics and practitioners have been interested in how sustainable development and marketing strategies should include plans to prepare, protect and rebuild a destination after a disaster, both in terms of physical assets and destination image (Aljerf & Choukaife, 2016; Okuyama, 2018) . The perceptions of safety is an important aspect of destination image, and different types of risks and events have been studied in the context of visitor travel information seeking and decision making (Sharifpour, Walters, Ritchie, & Winter, 2014; Trumbo et al., 2016; Williams & Bal\ufffd a\ufffd z, 2015) . Re-establishing public perceptions of safety and attractiveness following a disaster is crucial to attract and reassure potential visitors to travel to the destination and, by doing so, assisting the affected area to regain functionality and economic recovery (WTTC, 2018) . In addition to understanding visitor perceptions, it has been found that addressing risk perceptions and behaviours of relevant tourism stakeholder is critical for effective disaster response and recovery (Kozak, Crotts, & Law, 2007; Park & Reisinger, 2010) . Tourism is exposed and vulnerable to multiple types of hazards (Becken, Zammit, & Hendrikx, 2015) , and disasters have the potential to deter visitors from travelling to affected destinations (Bhati, Upadhayaya, & Sharma, 2016) . However, empirical research that confirms or quantifies the relationship between disasters and tourism activity is scant. Existing studies have taken a case study approach (e.g. for Chinese outbound tourism, see Jin, Qu, & Bao, 2019) , but a global analysis is missing (Ghaderi, Mat Som, & Henderson, 2014; J\ufffd onsd\ufffd ottir, 2011; Mazzocchi & Montini, 2001; Ruci\ufffd nska & Lechowicz, 2014) . It is therefore timely to undertake a global study that uses a consistent approach to measuring the impact of disasters on international tourism movements. To increase the value of such a study for tourism managers, it needs to be designed in a way that includes a wide range of disaster types and magnitudes in the same model (Ghimire, 2016) .",

To that end, this research integrates two different global datasets, namely one on disasters and another one on bilateral international tourist flows. A gravity model for international tourism flows is defined to quantify the effects of different disaster events on international tourist arrivals to the affected country. More precisely, we analyze the impact of droughts, earthquakes (ground movements and tsunamis), epidemics, cold and heat waves, floods, industrial accidents, landslides, wildfires, storms and volcanic activities. Moreover, we use three different proxies to measure the impact of disasters; namely the number of deaths, affected people and economic costs. Results will support the tourism sector and other key players (e.g. international insurance companies) in developing adequate responses to managing risk and recovery. To the best of our knowledge, the present research is the first attempt to undertake such an integrated analysis at a global scale.",

Several examples in the literature provide empirical evidence of reductions in tourist arrivals following major events. For instance, Mazzocchi and Montini (2001) evaluated the impact on visitation to the Umbria region in Central Italy, following a major earthquake in September 1997. The data showed that arrivals fell drastically the first month after the main shock, with ongoing loss in tourism activity being recorded until June 1998. A case study of a volcanic eruption at the Eyjafjallaj\u20ac okull glacier in Iceland on 14th March 2010 showed that tourism numbers to Iceland reduced by 49% until 28th April 2011 (J\ufffd onsd\ufffd ottir, 2011). Huang and Min (2002) analyzed the Taiwan earthquake in September 1999, using an integrated moving average model to explore the recovery process. Their study revealed that the island's inbound arrivals had not yet fully recovered from the earthquake's devastation after 11 months. Kuo, Chen, Tseng, Ju, and Huang (2008) also used a time series model to investigate the impacts of infectious diseases, including Avian Flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome, on international tourist arrivals in Asia. The empirical results indicated that the numbers of affected cases had a significant impact in the case of SARS (see also Mao, Ding, & Lee, 2010; McAleer, Huang, Kuo, Chen, & Chang, 2010) , but for Avian Flu.",

Gravity models are commonly used in the trade literature (Anderson, 2011) , and increasingly in tourism research (Fourie, Rossell\ufffd o-Nadal, & Santana-Gallego, 2019; Khadaroo & Seetanah, 2008; Santeramo & Morelli, 2015) . These models consider that international flows between two countries are directly proportional to their economic size, and inversely proportional to the distance between them. Consequently, the level of bilateral tourism flows can be explained by a set of determining variables as in a demand equation. Morley et al., 2014 have shown that gravity models to explain bilateral tourism can be derived from consumer choice theory. Accordingly, the formulation of a gravity model can also be interpreted as a tourism demand equation.",

Specific consideration is not necessary, because all these variables are captured by these fixed effects, as also suggested by Balli, Ghassan, and Jeefri (2019), Fourie et al.

Both variables were taken from the World Development Indicators (WDI) elaborated by the World Bank. Third, we also consider an instability indicator that concerns safety and security of visitors when they travel to a destination. Whilst there are different ways for evaluating safety and security at international level (See Cr\ufffd o & Martins, 2017b; Cr\ufffd o, Martins, Sim\u00f5es, & Calisto, 2018; Fourie et al., 2019 or Santana-Gallego, Fourie, & Rossell\ufffd o, 2020 in this case, and due to data coverage reasons, we use a proxy of the crime rate defined as the number of homicides per 10,000 inhabitants in the destination country (Crime jt ). Data also stem from the WDI. On the other hand, vector X k ijt includes a variable to control for the intensity of the economic relationship between a pair of countries, which is also time varying. The idea is to capture the presence of trade agreements between country pairs as an indicator of bilateral relationships that could boost tourism. This variable (RTA ijt ) is a dummy variable for being a signatory to the same regional trade agreement and stems from the Regional Trade Agreements Information System compiled by the World Trade Organization.",

The main objective of the database is to inform humanitarian action at national and international levels. The initiative aims to rationalize decision making for disaster preparedness, as well as provide an objective base for vulnerability assessment and priority setting. EM-DAT contains core data on the occurrence and effects of over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to the present day. The database is compiled from various sources, including UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, insurance companies, research institutes and press agencies. 1 According to the objectives of this present research, the disaster types included in EM-DAT and considered in our analysis are presented in Tables 1 and 2. For the gravity equation estimation we are limited by the availability of the tourist database (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) . All other datasets provide data for this timeframe as well, leading to a database that covers a total number of 7885 events from the period of 1995-2013. These are described using three types of impact metrics (Table 1) . More specifically, of all events, 74.8% report information on the number of deaths, 59.3% report the extent of affected people (beyond deaths) and 31.7% state an estimated amount of damage measured in economic terms.",

For instance, in the case of storms, although only 16.8% take place in the Americas, the impact in terms of deaths, affected people and costs is comparatively high (42.5%, 60.3% and 66.1%, respectively) than in other regions. A similar result is obtained for earthquakes in the Asia-Pacific regions (44.5% of events), with disproportionally high impacts in relation to the number of deaths (49.2%), affected people (85.2%) and costs (73.4%). Europe, with some exception, is characterized by a lower incidence of deaths and affected people, but a higher occurrence of costs. Table 3 shows the most important events for each type of disaster in the database. For example, it can be observed that the Earthquake of Haiti in January 2010, which led to 222,570 deaths, was the worst event in terms of fatalities. The major storm (Cyclone Nargis) that occurred in Myanmar during May 2008 resulted in 138,366 deaths, the second largest number in the records. In terms of affected people, the drought affecting India during 2015 and 2016 was the most significant event reported in the database (330 million people impacted). Disasters also cause substantial economic damage. The highest economic loss recorded was tropical hurricane Katrina that made landfall in New Orleans, USA. It caused a total amount of damage of $125 billion.",

Following guidance from the previous literature Another important issue to be considered is the multicollinearity that can arise between the different types of impacts related to the same specific disaster. Thus, it is expected (and found) that the consequences of a certain disaster in terms of deaths will be correlated to other impacts measured in terms of affected people and economic costs. The increase in the variance of the coefficient estimates could drive them to be unstable and difficult to interpret. Consequently, our first strategy is to consider the three impact metrics (i.e. deaths, affected people and cost) separately in different equations. Additionally, for each of the three metrics, we evaluate the possibility to distribute the effects within 6 and 12 months. This results in 6 specifications: three for each of the impacts, times the two evaluation periods (6 and 12 months).",

Through this strategy, it is possible to explore in detail if effects arise that counteract the initially expected negative relationship between disaster impacts and tourism flows. Again, two impact timeframes are considered. The gravity model for bilateral tourism flows as defined in equation [1] is estimated by using the Correia (2017) procedure to estimate linear models with many levels of fixed effects. This procedure is a generalization of the panel-fixed effects estimator with both country-pair and origin-year fixed effects. Database includes 171 countries for the period 1995-2013. Table 4 presents the results of estimating equation [1] for the bilateral tourist arrivals (LnTou ijt ) as dependent variable and including each disaster impact measure separately. As previously mentioned, because our variable of interest is destination-country time variant, country pairs fixed effects and origin-year fixed effects are included in the model to control for any type of determinant at origin or country-pair level. Therefore, only time variant country-pair and destination-specific determinants are required. Each column shows the estimate of different disaster consequences (D \u00bc deaths, A \u00bc affected people, and C \u00bc economic costs) and the two alternatives for distributing the effects across the following 6 and 12 months. It is important to mention that we are interested in estimating the short-run effect of the natural disaster on inbound tourism. Exploring how the tourism sector at the destination country recovers in the long-run is beyond the objective of the paper.",

The coefficients for both LnGDPpc jt and LnPop jt are significantly positive and slightly higher that unity, implying that a 1% increase in the destination GDP per capita and population will lead to an increase higher than 1% on tourist arrivals to the country. The coefficient for the RTA ijt , that controls for the existence of a trade agreement between country pairs during specific years, is also significant and positive. In this case, due to the binary nature of the explanatory variable used, the estimated coefficient (slightly higher that 0.04) implies that the existence of a trade agreement increases the number of tourists to a destination by more than 4%. Finally, and as expected, the variable related to low levels of security and safety at the destination country (Crime jt ) shows a negative effect, indicating that an increase in the number of homicides (per 10,000 inhabitants) reduces tourist arrivals. In reference to the different types of disasters, for events associated with Tsunamis, Floods and Volcanoes, all the significant parameters are found to be negative, indicating that these three types of disasters constitute substantial negative motivators for prospective visitors. A more detailed examination of coefficients highlights that volcanic eruptions appear most deterring to international tourists. This circumstance could be related to the severity of the damage caused by volcanic eruptions, including potentially irreversible damage to infrastructure or the complete loss of a natural asset. For the occurrence of an eruption, and for every increase in the number of deaths (for every 1000 people), affected (in millions of people) and costs (in millions of US$), there will be a decrease in international tourists to the destination between 1.07% and 1.32%, 2.13%-1.78% and 4.51%-3.44%, respectively (according to whether the 6 or 12 months delay is considered).",

For every million affected people, an increase between 0.34% and 0.35% is expected. Consequently, and considering the negative effect of economic damage mentioned above, the net effect of Wildfires on tourism should consider the two different types of disaster impact measures. Earthquakes show a similar negative impact compared with Tsunamis (see above) in terms of the economic costs of the disaster, with falls around 0.002% for every million US$ cost. However, the other impact metrics do not show a negative relationship. In terms of number of fatalities, there is even an increase in tourism for the number of deaths per 1000 people by 0.002%. Thus, the overall impact of an earthquake is a combination of decreases in response to economic damage and number of deaths. Industrial Accidents and Storms show similar patterns in that there is a positive relationship between the number of fatalities and affected people, but a negative relationship between the economic impact of the disaster and tourism arrivals. For example, for Storms there is a decrease in arrivals by 0.003% for every million US$ cost but increases between 0.018% and 0.024% for every death/1000 people and between 0.018%-0.024% and 0.03-0.04% for every million people affected.",

It is perhaps not surprising that the relationship between disaster costs and tourism is not significant for Drought. Overall, it is less likely that drought conditions produce direct impacts on tourism-relevant infrastructures and supplies, as tourism businesses might absorb the extra costs of supplying water during water constrained times.

Tourists may not see a risk to their own safety. Also, there could be an increase in tourism for some disasters due to the arrival of humanitarian 'tourists' and people visiting friends and relatives. Whilst generally, this observation might be testimony to tourism resilience, and indeed reassuring for destination managers, there may be situations where continuous tourism demand after a disaster is hindering recovery works or impacting the well-being of residents.

Strategies used to predict natural disasters and mitigate hazard risks in the first place need to be deployed to minimize the impacts. Examples include the implementation of appropriate building codes, zoning regulations, and emergency training and preparedness for key stakeholders. New policies and practices may require additional resources, but investments into preparedness are likely to generate positive returns in the long term. In general, the empirical results in this paper confirm that disaster events are challenging news for tourism managers who need to deal with an unexpected fall in tourism demand. Clearly, economic damage from an unexpected event leads to some reductions in tourist arrivals. In those cases, efforts by destination managers should focus on the recovery of necessary infrastructure and business capability. Proactive planning, for example around business continuity, business support networks, and recovery assistance programs, could accelerate this effort (Hystad & Keller, 2008) . Leadership may come from government agencies, destination management organizations, or businesses themselves. Related research in New Zealand revealed that leadership is \"mainly provided by tourism stakeholders with a community-value orientation, and to a lesser extent by those who are mainly business-driven\" (Hughey & Becken, 2016, p. 69) . In other words, response and recovery is often led by individuals who have a strong commitment to, and engagement with, the affected community.",

The positive relationship between number of tourists and affected people of fatalities by some disasters implies that these can attract visitors to the destination, a circumstance that should be taken into account by the managers of the destination. There are many different reasons why visitors might want to visit a destination that had been affected by a disaster (e.g. Ruci\ufffd nska & Lechowicz, 2014 on dark tourism), and understanding this non-orthodox typology of visitor types could be useful for destination managers. Regardless, marketing activities have to be designed with great care to attract the right types of visitors at the right time, considering potentially ongoing limitations around tourism capacity (Okuyama, 2018; Orchiston & Higham, 2014) . Marketing campaigns implemented by businesses, local tourist destinations or national tourism bureaus should ideally align in their messaging and magnitude, implying a particular need for vertical integration following a disaster (Hughey & Becken, 2016) .",

Consequently, results obtained in this paper should be considered as average responses. Future research should further explore this matter and investigate if differences among countries in reference to their level of development exist.
