This drill provided the opportunity to evaluate the ability of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (NYC-DOHMH) emergency department chief complaint syndromic surveillance system to detect a cluster of patients with febrile respiratory illness. Methods: The evaluation was a prospective simulation. The clinical picture was modeled on severe acute respiratory syndrome symptoms. Forty-four volunteers participated in the drill as mock patients. Results: Records from 42 patients (95%) were successfully transmitted to the NYC-DOHMH. The electronic chief complaint for 24 (57%) of these patients indicated febrile or respiratory illness. The drill did not generate a statistical signal in the NYC-DOHMH SaTScan analysis. The 42 drill patients were classified in 8 hierarchical categories based on chief complaints: sepsis (2), cold (3), diarrhea (2), respiratory (20), fever/flu (4), vomit (3), and other (8). The number of respiratory visits, while elevated on the day of the drill, did not appear particularly unusual when compared with the 14-day baseline period used for spatial analyses. Conclusions: This drill with a cluster of patients with febrile respiratory illness failed to trigger a signal from the NYC-DOHMH emergency department chief complaint syndromic surveillance system. This highlighted several limitations and challenges to syndromic surveillance monitoring.",

Targeted active surveillance has been used to monitor special events (eg, athletic competitions and political conventions), but this is expensive and not sustainable [5, 6] . Syndromic surveillance refers to the realtime monitoring of clinical syndromes, rather than specific disease etiologies [3] . This approach has received attention as a potentially rapid, economical, and flexible supplement to ongoing traditional surveillance activity [7] . Syndromic surveillance is now used as a part of routine public health monitoring in many local and state health departments [8] . This activity has proven value for monitoring citywide and regional trends of community-wide illness, such as influenza [9] , but its ability to detect clusters of illness is less clear.",

Hospital-based drills are one way to test these systems based on emergency department visit or hospital admission data and are capable of identifying both logistic shortcomings and limitations in the outbreak detection algorithms used to detect clusters. Next to actual events, these simulations are probably the most realistic way of evaluating this monitoring. Unlike computer models or simulations [10, 11] , drills challenge the communication chain from the moment a patient enters the health care system until an alert is relayed back to that and other facilities regarding the cluster of cases. Finally, drills can be conducted in a nearly blind fashion, with only the health care workers at individual facilities aware that artificial cases are being transmitted for analysis.",

Later, at the time of disposition, a clerk transferred the handwritten information into the hospital's electronic registration database.

These categories are hierarchical in the order listed, so that a patient whose chief complaint was \"cold, runny nose, cough, and fever\" would be classified in the cold syndrome category, not the respiratory or fever syndrome category. Patients are further subdivided into age groupings. The main daily analysis of the NYC-DOHMH examines trends in respiratory and fever syndromes among patients aged 13 years and older and diarrhea and vomiting syndromes in patients of all ages. Using these parameters, 19 (63%) of the 30 patients who complained of fever and cough were included in the respiratory syndrome cluster analysis, and 4 (13%) were included in the fever syndrome cluster analysis.",

Despite using what was thought to be a sufficient number of drill patients in the respiratory and fever syndrome group, our exercise did not generate an investigation signal at the NYC-DOHMH. Retrospective review of the data from that day suggests that the drill cases were diluted by the high baseline level of fever and respiratory visits at the 3 hospitals. In addition, despite explicit scripts and rules of conduct, the chief complaints of 6 patients (20%) did not result in assignment to the targeted syndrome group. The 6 SARS patients were misclassified in 3 categories: other (n = 3), sepsis (n = 2), and cold (n = 1). For 5 of the 6, misclassification was the result of incomplete information in the electronic chief complaint. That is, information collected by the triage nurse would have resulted in assignment to the appropriate syndromic group, but incomplete data entry by clerical staff resulted in misclassification. For 1 of the 6, misclassification occurred when the hierarchical syndrome coding algorithm used by the NYC-DOHMH classified \"runny nose\" into the cold syndrome category, despite the presence of text strings \"cough\" and \"fever\" in the chief complaint. Further details on these 6 patients are shown in Table 1 . Other authors have described the impact of different methods used to group data into syndromic categories [14] .",

The median age of mock patients in the drill was 17 years. The NYC-DOHMH uses 2 age groups: less than 13 and 13 and older. For this reason, many of the younger drill patients were included in the adult age group. If alternative or multiple age groups were used, it is possible that our exercise would have generated a signal. However, much like changing the threshold for cluster detection, this could also have the effect of increasing the number of signals that would need to be investigated. Continued research is needed to optimize the detection algorithms for identifying clusters that may represent a disease outbreak [14] .",

            "text": "Drills likely offer the most realistic opportunity to evaluate a syndromic surveillance system based at a clinical setting; however, there are still limitations to this approach. Hospital staff are necessarily aware of an ongoing exercise on the day of the drill. This awareness could have skewed isolation practices and biased case finding, resulting in different triage documentation for drill patients. Alternatively, it is possible that, in a busy emergency department, the volunteer patients may not have received the same intensity of medical attention as their real counterparts, as they did not appear to be ill and were not able to realistically simulate sick patients. For this reason, the drill could have underestimated the capacity of the emergency departments to correctly record clinical symptoms in the triage log and registration system. Both of these factors may contribute to a lack of accuracy in the electronic chief complaints, which could then translate into misclassification of individual cases by the NYC-DOHMH. In addition, drills and simulations do not take account of the notification efforts of individual health care workers. As was the case in our drill, a clear epidemiological link existed between the participants. In a real outbreak, an astute health care worker would hopefully notify the local department of health directly. Furthermore, even if the drill had generated a signal from the NYC-DOHMH, it would not have been recognized until the data were analyzed the next day. Syndromic surveillance is not intended as a replacement for traditional provider-based reporting of unusual disease manifestations or clusters. Syndromic surveillance is a fast, inexpensive, and flexible adjunct to traditional public health monitoring. As currently designed and used, however, these systems may not be sensitive enough to detect smaller syndrome clusters. Using information from drills and computer simulations, refinements in these networks may improve them and lead to better detection of distributed and smaller clusters. Notifications from health care workers will always play a major role in the identification of outbreaks, but new detection mechanisms like syndromic surveillance could generate supplementary information streams to augment ongoing public health activities.",
