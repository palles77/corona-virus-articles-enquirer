The evidence suggesting that viruses preceded the appearance of other classes of living organisms is based in part on the observation that some archaeans, bacteria, and eukaryotes have homologous genes that code for capsid proteins, such as would be derived from a class of viruses. The simplest explanation for homology for a viral-type gene, in all extant cellular forms of life, is that an ancient gene came from viral species that lived at a time that preceded the emergence of newer forms of life [10] . Over the aeons, retroviruses have had a chance to insert lots of DNA fragments into eukaryotic species.

Oncogenes, many of which have a retroviral origin, are genes that play a key role in driving cells toward a cancer phenotype. Oncogenes are highly conserved genes, indicating a beneficial role for the species (otherwise, they would not be conserved). Nonetheless, oncogenes clearly have a deleterious effect on some individuals within the species (i.e., by causing cancer). One particularly striking example occurs in a polycythemia strain of mice carrying the Friend murine leukemia virus. All the mice of this particular strain have polycythemia, a condition characterized by a sustained increase in the number of circulating red blood cells. It seems that the resident virus codes for a nonfunctional Env (viral envelope) gene. The protein coded by the degenerate Env gene serves as a mimic for the normal erythropoietin gene of the mouse, causing an increase in red cell production (i.e., polycythemia) [24, 25] . Participating in eukaryotic evolution, and accounting in no small way for the generation of new species and new strains of species, as viruses certainly do, are itself a biological function, and another indicator of viral life.",

If every eukaryotic cell is conceptualized as a potential virocell, then every eukaryotic species is a potential slave owned by the viral kingdom. The viruses probably think they're doing us a favor.

It is the uniparental ancestry of biological classifications that accounts for their simplicity, and for the concept of lineage, wherein the ancestry of any species can be computed from an uninterrupted line of classes stretching from the species level to the root level.

Not so. Instead, we are finding fundamental molecular motifs that can be used to classify viruses into biological groups that share phylogenetic origins [39, 16] . For example, despite the sequence variations that occur in rapidly mutating viruses, scientists are finding that the three-dimensional folds of protein molecules are conserved, and that viruses can be grouped into the so-called fold families, which can in turn be grouped into fold super families, that preserve phylogenetic relationships among viral lineages [39] .",

            "text": "Though we cannot as yet classify viruses strictly by their evolutionary lineage, we can usefully group viruses based on the physical characteristics of their genomes. The Baltimore Classification divides viruses into seven groups based on whether their genome is DNA, RNA, single stranded, or double stranded, the sense of the single strand, and the presence or absence of a reverse transcriptase. Here are the classes of the pathogenic viruses. This classification, though nonphylogenetic in concept, has the great advantage of being comprehensive: every known virus can be assigned to a group within the Baltimore Classification. It is worth repeating that when we use the Baltimore Classification (or any alternate viral classification, for that matter) we must grudgingly accept the fact that biologically relevant features of grouped viruses will cross taxonomic boundaries. Consider the arboviruses. Arbovirus is a shortened name for Arthropod borne virus. The arboviruses fall into several different groups of viruses. The principle vectors of the arboviruses are mosquitoes, ticks. Mosquito-borne arboviruses are members of Class Bunyaviridae (Group V), Flaviviridae (Group IV), or Togaviridae (Group IV). Tick-borne arboviruses are members of Class Bunyarviridae (Group V), Flaviviridae (Group IV), or Reoviridae (Group III). Over 500 arboviruses, infecting a variety of animals, have been described [47] . The arboviruses, organized by their transmission vectors, as shown below, cross multiple viral groups. It would seem that we do not know enough about the origin and phylogeny of the different classes of viruses to create a true classification, wherein viruses of a class share a common set of inherited relationships. There is, however, hope for a future in which viruses can be organized by phylogenetic principles. Highly innovative work in the field of viral phylogeny is proceeding, from a variety of different approaches, including: inferring retroviral phylogeny by sequence divergences of nucleic acids and proteins in related viral species [16] ; tracing the acquisition of genes in DNA viruses [41] ; and dating viruses by the appearance of viral-specific antibodies in ancient host cells [12] . Because viruses evolve very rapidly, it is possible to trace the evolution of some viruses, with precision, over intervals as short as centuries or even decades [39, [42] [43] [44] . It should be noted that before the advent of ribosomal sequence analysis, and as recently as the early 1970s, bacterial phylogeny was considered a hopeless field [37] . Bacteria were grouped by morphology, nutritional requirements, and enzymatic reactions (e.g., hemolysis, coagulase, etc.) without much attention to phylogenetic relationships. The field of viral phylogeny is quickly catching up with the phylogeny of living organisms. Members of Class Herpesviridae are commonly known as herpesviruses. These viruses produce acute disease characterized by lytic (i.e., cytopathic) effects in infected cells; and latent disease, characterized by recurrences of disease, sometimes spanning the life of the host. After cells are infected by virus particles, the viral genome migrates to the host nucleus, where replication and transcription of the viral genes occurs. After a latent phase, viruses may precipitate a lytic phase, manifesting as clinical disease. The recurring disease may be clinically distinct from the initial infection (e.g., chicken pox, the initial varicella virus infection, is followed decades later by shingles). Some of the herpesviruses are DNA transforming viruses.",

Smallpox is reputed to have killed about 300 million people in the 20th century, prior to the widespread availability of an effective vaccine. Smallpox has been referred to as the greatest killer in human history. Its mortality rate was 30%-35%, which is significantly less than some of the hemorrhagic viruses (e.g., Ebola virus, Group V, has a mortality rate of nearly 90%).

Consequently, vaccine experts are searching for vaccines that confer immunity, partial or full, for several different pathogens or for several variants of a single pathogen [50] . An interesting development in this field is that the smallpox vaccine may confer limited protection against HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection. Both viruses enhance their infectivity by exploiting a receptor, CCR5, on the surface of white blood cells. This shared mode of infection may contribute to the cross-protection against HIV that seems to come from smallpox vaccine. It has been suggested that the emergence of HIV in the 1980s may have resulted, in part, from the cessation of smallpox vaccinations in the late 1970s [51] .",

The large size and complexity of Class Mimiviridae exemplifies the advantage of a double-stranded DNA genome. DNA is much more chemically stable than RNA, and can be faithfully replicated, even when its length exceeds a billion base pairs. A double-stranded DNA genome can be protected by DNA repair enzymes, and by external modifications to the DNA structure.

The term \"orphan,\" when applied to a virus indicates that no known diseases are associated with the virus. This is no longer the case for the Reoviruses. The most clinically significant species in Class Reoviridae is rotavirus. In 2004, rotavirus infections accounted for about a half million deaths in young children, from severe diarrhea [57] .

Members of Class Nidovirales do not package polymerase in the viral particle. The genome is read directly using host enzymes. Class Nidovirales contains one subclass with viruses that infect humans: Class Coronaviridae. The coronaviruses are characterized by gylocoprotein spikes (peplomers) that protrude from the envelope that encloses the round nucleocapsid. The arrangement of peplomers resembles a corona (hence, coronavirus). SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus produces a severe flu-like illness, and is spread by close human contact. The earliest outbreak of SARS occurred in Southeast Asia, in 2002. Soon thereafter, cases occurred in distant locations, including Toronto, Canada, and Bangalore, India. The worldwide response to SARS was possibly the most intensive public health effort ever launched to stem an epidemic of a new, and potentially fatal, viral disease.

Adaptive immunity is a system wherein somatic T cells and B cells are produced, each with a unique and characteristic immunoglobulin (in the case of B cells) or T-cell receptor (in the case of T cells). Through a complex presentation and selection system, a foreign antigen elicits the replication of a B cell that produces an antibody whose unique immunoglobulin attachment site matches the antigen. Antigenantibody complexes may deactivate and clear circulating antibodies, or may lead to the destruction of the organism that carries the antigen (e.g., virus or bacteria). The process of producing unique proteins requires that recombination and hypermutation take place within a specific gene region. Recombinations yield on the order of about a billion unique somatic genes, starting with one germinal genome. This process requires the participation of recombination-activating genes (RAGs). The acquisition of an immunologically active recombination-activating gene from a retrovirus is presumed to be the key evolutionary event that led to the development of the adaptive immune system. This event, which occurred in one of the early species of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), established the adaptive immune system in all jawed vertebrates and their descendants. As one might expect, inherited mutations in RAG genes cause immune-deficiency syndromes [65, 66] . Bat A bat is not a flying mouse and is not a member of Class Rodentia, flying or otherwise.",

Their relevance in this book stems from their status as viral vectors. Currently, bat populations of many species are being decimated by Geomyces destructans, a fungus in Class Ascomycota, the cause of white-nose syndrome. Apparently, the fungal infection, which grows in cold conditions, awakens bats from their deep hibernation; starvation results. Blood contamination When a blood donor is infected with a pathogenic organism, the disease can be passed to the recipient. Examples of organisms and diseases that can be spread through blood transfused blood or blood components include: The protein shell of a virus that encloses the genetic material of the virus when the virus is outside its host cell. The capsid aids the virus with its attachment to the target host cell, and with the penetration of the viral genome into the host cell. Evolvability Evolution by natural selection is not a physiological process, like respiration or replication. The theory of evolution is little more than a restatement of a probabilistic truism, in biological terms. Namely, organisms that are most likely to survive will be the organisms most likely to reproduce. Biologists speak in terms of evolvability to indicate certain factors that may tip the evolutionary scales in an organism's favor.",

These are Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Pathogenic viruses that attack any particular organ need not all belong to the same biological class, and the named hepatitis viruses are no exception, belonging to Groups IV, V, and VII.

            "text": "Phenetics An approach to classification wherein objects are grouped together based on a shared set of physical features. In this book, we make the argument that phenetics is an improper approach for biological classifications insofar as two distantly related species may share a physical similarity (e.g., ability to fly or aquatic life) without having any close ancestral relationship, without having a close genetic relationship, and without sharing many metabolic pathways. As the biologist George Gaylord Simpson put it, \"Individuals do not belong in the same taxon because they are similar, but they are similar because they belong to the same taxon\" [69] . Transposon Also called transposable element, and informally known as jumping gene. The name \"transposable element\" would seem to imply that a fragment of the genome (i.e., the transposable element) physically moves from one point in the genome to another. This is not the case. What actually happens (in the case of Class II transposons) is that a copy of the DNA sequence of the transposon is inserted elsewhere in the genome, resulting in the sequence now occupying two different locations in the genome. In the case of Class II transposons, the DNA sequence of the transposon is translated into RNA, then reversetranscribed as DNA, and reinserted at another location; likewise resulting in two of the same sequence in two locations in the genome [70] . You can see how transposable elements might bloat the genome with repeated elements. Some transposons are the ancient remnants of retroviruses and other horizontally transferred genes that insinuated their way into the eukaryotic genome. Because transposon DNA is not necessary for cell survival, the sequences of transposons are not conserved, and mutations occurring over time yield degenerate sequences that no longer function as retroviruses. A role for transposons in the altered expression of genes in cancer cells has been suggested [71] . Virion The infective form of a virus outside the host cell. Viruses can be thought of as having two alternating forms: the virion and the virocell. Virocell The name given to a host cell that has been commandeered by a virus to devote its cellular machinery to the mass production of virus particles. When we think of viruses a living organisms, it is best to envisage the virocell, which consists of a viral factory built from the wreckage of the host cells; and not the virion, which is simply a vehicle for transporting a virus safely from host to host.",

Group VI, ssRNA-RT Group VII, dsDNA-RT The Group IV viruses have a positive sense RNA genome. Positive sense RNA can be translated directly into protein, without a DNA intermediate and without creating a complementary RNA strand. To replicate its genome, though, a complementary RNA strand is required. The positive RNA strand serves as a template for an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, yielding a complementary RNA strand, to form a dimer with the template strand. The double-stranded RNA subsequently serves as the template for a new positive sense genome.",

Togaviruses have a genome approximately 12 kbases in length, somewhat larger than the genome of Class Picornaviridae. Togaviruses live in the cytoplasm of their host cells, where viral replication and gene expression take place. Class Togaviridae contains two subclasses: Class Alphavirus and Class Rubivirus. All the members of Class Alphavirus are arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) spread by mosquitoes (primarily) or ticks. Class Rubivirus contains only one species that is infective in humans: Rubella virus, the cause of German measles. Rubella is spread directly from person to person, without an insect vector. Readers should not confuse Rubella virus with the measles virus, Rubeola. Rubeola virus is a paramyxovirus (Group V), unrelated to Rubella virus.",

Michael Emerman and Harmit Malik [12] Group I, dsDNA Group II, ssDNA Group III, dsRNA Group IV (+)ssRNA Group V (-)ssRNA Group VI, ssRNA-RT Group VII, dsDNA-RT Hepadnaviridae Group VII viruses are double-stranded DNA viruses that can integrate their DNA into the host genome, using a reverse transcriptase enzyme. The reverse transcriptase enzyme acts upon RNA, transcribed from viral DNA, as the template for genomic DNA. Hence, the Group VII viruses are an unusual type of retrovirus that do not belong to Class Retroviridae (Group VI), because the genome is double-stranded DNA. Likewise, the Group VII viruses are not classed within the double-stranded DNA viruses (Group I) because their replication requires the synthesis of an RNA intermediate. Group VII has one class of viruses that is pathogenic in humans: Class Hepadnaviridae. Hepadnaviruses (short for HEPAtic DNA VIRUS) have a small, circular DNA genome. Class Hepadnaviridae contains one viral species that is pathogenic in humans: hepatitis B virus.",
