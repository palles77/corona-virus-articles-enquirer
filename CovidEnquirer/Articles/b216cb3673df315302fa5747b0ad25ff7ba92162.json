This is especially true given the lack of relevant diagnostic testing in much of the world, which impacted the proportion of patients without identified pathogens. 15 The availability of global data and collaboration is essential, given the likely international nature of future outbreaks and requirements for pre-established coordination efforts. 16 The lack of a dedicated sampling protocol clearly impacts on interpretation of those findings. Future work should focus on optimising hospital sampling strategies to better understand global SARI disease; the lack of SARI pathogen-specific diagnostics on recently released Essential Diagnostic Lists exemplifies the lack of clarity on best testing strategies. 17 Regional SARI surveillance data have been published from a variety of countries 18 19 ; while we have yet to completely avoid site selection bias through BMJ Global Health the availability of reporting hospitals, the data collection tools used help reduce the risk of bias from individual patient selection or pathogen-specific attribution.",

The lack of complete severity-of-illness data from lower income regions impedes the ability to effectively understand this counterintuitive result.",

We demonstrated that presentation, management and outcomes for patients with SARI vary substantially according to global region. The implications of this variation are large, and suggest a need for ongoing, prospective data collection at a global scale to ensure a better understanding of patient characteristics, specific SARI risk factors and the importance of a reliable risk adjustment method for international comparative studies. Further, the use of organ dysfunction, as measured by a SOFA score collected on presentation for critically ill patients with SARI in disparate settings, appears promising. This deserves further work for risk stratification and early outbreak severity predictions, particularly in children where our data are limited.",

Given its primary objective of being a research preparedness exercise, data verification audits were not exhaustively performed, and small numbers in some regions may lead to unstable proportions during comparisons. The patients that were enrolled in the study may not be representative of all critically ill patients with SARI, based on the period of data collected and location of participating hospitals. Second is the lack of a formal denominator to assess the impact of SARI on hospital-level or population-level burden of disease, or to generate estimates of disease incidence. Capturing hospital-wide activity requires substantially larger research resources at participating institutions, and there is variation as to the screening processes present at participating institutions. Third, integrating alternate patient-centred outcomes such as quality of life or functional status on discharge 23 24 would provide valuable data; however, this data collection is beyond the scope of this work and will be further integrated as programmes continue to scale. Given the mostly unfunded nature of this work at the site level, these expansions can only occur with established operational support. Finally, the availability and definitions of intensive care units are variable across regions, and this impacts any discussion on interventions received, such as dialysis or mechanical ventilation. 25 ",
