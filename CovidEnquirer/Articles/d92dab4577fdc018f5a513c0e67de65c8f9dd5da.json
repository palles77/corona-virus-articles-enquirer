Some investigators have considered these particles as viruses and as potential pathogens in human diarrhea, necrotizing enterocolitis, and malabsorption. Others cite their variable size and appearance, their presence in control stool specimens and failure to be cultivated in tissue culture as evidence that they might represent cell debris or even portions of other microorganisms (Macnaughton and Davies, 1981) . Critical to its acceptance as a virus and a potential human pathogen is its growth in (a) readily available cell line(s) and the accessibility of virus seed stocks in a depository like the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). It will also be important to exclude the possibility that HEC is not a known human respiratory coronavirus strain (229E or OC43) that for some reason has been found in stool or that the virus does not represent a laboratory contaminant of a known animal coronavirus, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV).",

In contrast to endemic NEC, these outbreaks were in older, higher birth weight infants and the case fatality rate was lower. Coronavirus-like particles (CVLPs) were seen in stools by EM and the virus could be passed in human fetal intestinal organ culture. However, embryonic tissues were available in only a few centers and soon we also could not obtain these tissues. This report details the adaptation of HEC to a mouse peritoneal macrophage cell line (J744 cells), and to a mosquito cell line derived from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes (C6/36 cells). J774 cells were used because they support the growth of MHV. The use of C6/36 cells was a chance event. These cells were growing in the laboratory and we included them in the cells that were tested.",

Between each step, the strips were washed three times in tris-buffered saline. The biotinylated antisera and streptavidin peroxidase were obtained from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD. Hemagglutination studies were performed with mouse erythryocytes, 0.05%, suspended in PBS, pH 7.4. OC43 and 229E antigens and antisera were obtained from Dr John Hierholzer of the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA.

Immunofluorescent staining of the cytoplasm of both cell types could be demonstrated by the addition of immune but not non-immune sera followed by the appropriate fluoresceinated conjugate. Immunofluorescence appeared first in J774 cells and soon after in C6/36 cells; in an occasional titration in C6/36 cells, immunofluorescence appeared late but was always present 21 days after inoculation. With J774 cells, the addition of fluoresceinated anti-human Ig resulted in fluorescence of all the cells because these cells contain receptors for the Fc fragment of IgG. Specific reactions in J774 cells could only be demonstrated with the use of immune sera and a fluoresceinated anti-Hu IgM conjugate.

Although infected C6/36 cells were brightly stained by human immune sera, they were not stained by a 1:10 dilution of OC43 antiserum and only nonspecifically by 229E antiserum.

Viral immunofluorescence appears along with the presence of CPE in these cells and is localized to the cytoplasm. In C6/36 cells, there was no CPE but viral immunofluorescence appeared at about the same time as it did in J774 cells; occasionally immunofluorescence appeared later in C6/36 cells but was always present at 21 days after inoculation. We have shown that CVLPs are present in cysternae of the endoplasmic reticulum of infected J774 cells and have diameters ranging from 80 to 120 nm. After fixation with glutaraldehyde, the supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation, the precipitates resuspended and then negatively stained with PTA, pH 7.2. The preparations showed typical CVLPs that were slightly more pleomorphic than seen with TEM. Human immune sera stained the cytoplasm of both infected cell types. Mouse anti-OC43 and guinea pig anti-229E failed to stain infected C6/36 cells. We could not stain J774 cells with these reagents because these cells have Fc receptors for IgG and fluoresce non-specifically when these latter reagents were used.",

With WBs prepared from infected J774 cells, we obtained bands with IgM positive human antisera that corresponded to those seen by PAGE and silver staining. Staining the HEC WBs with anti-OC43, 229E and h N antisera prepared against the A59 stain of MHV did reveal some non-specific staining but the antisera did not stain the N protein of HEC while IgM antibody of patients stained this protein. Non-specific IgG staining was observed most probably because we were not able to purify the preparations from the Fc receptors for IgG that were on the J774 cells. Antiserum from Patient 1 (Ig and IgM) did not stain the N protein of OC43 and 229E viruses. In WBs prepared from infected C6/36 cells, the IgM of several patients stained appropriate bands. The immunofluorescent stains of infected C6/36 cells revealed specific fluorescence with these antisera but not with antisera to OC43 and 229E viruses.",

It has the EM appearance and size of a coronavirus and proteins consistent with that of other coronaviruses but distinctive in several regards. These proteins react with immune human sera. Antisera to OC43, 229E viruses, and h N antiserum against MHV (A59) do not stain the N protein of HEC. By averaging different preparations, the proteins of HEC range in molecular weight from 24 kDa, presumably the M protein to 190 kDa, the S protein. Inconstant bands are present at 124 and 64 kDa and could represent breakdown products of the S protein. The major protein, N, appears to center around 41 kDa, a size different from OC43 and 229E viruses. Antibodies to HEC may be prevalent in certain populations as determined by our capacity to obtain sera with IgM reactivity. The patients with AIDS had sera collected in the 1980s, a relatively early part of the HIV epidemic.",

Caul and associates reported cultivation of these particles in human embryo intestinal organ culture and human embryo kidney monolayers . They were not able to prepare virus seed stocks that could be distributed to other investigators. In the early 1980s, four investigative groups found evidence of these particles in stool and tried to relate them to disease. In Paris, CVLPs were associated with outbreaks of NEC in 1979 and 1980 in separate hospitals within the city (Chaney et al., 1982; Rousset et al., 1984) . In Italy, they were associated with childhood diarrhea and Gerna and colleagues presented evidence that linked them antigenically to OC43 virus (Gerna et al., 1981 (Gerna et al., , 1984 (Gerna et al., , 1985 . In Arizona, Ray and associates related their presence to diarrheal disease in the nursery and then to diarrhea in the community (Vaucher et al., 1982; Mortensen et al., 1985) . In Dallas, Texas in 1982 -1983 , several outbreaks of NEC and diarrhea occurred in a Special Care Nursery at Parkland Memorial Hospital (Resta et al., 1985) . The disease outbreaks suggested a transmissible agent since they affected older children, had a lower case fatality rate, tended to occur as clusters of cases, and disease incidence could be related to breaks in enteric isolation techniques. Using stool samples from these infants, a coronavirus was isolated in human fetal intestinal organ cultures.",
