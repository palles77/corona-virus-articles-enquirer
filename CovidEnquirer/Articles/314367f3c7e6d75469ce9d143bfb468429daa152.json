In December 1903, on a very windy beach in North Carolina, USA, Wilbur and Orville Wright successfully designed, built, and flew the first powered aircraft. In the air for only seconds, it marked the beginning of modern aviation. In just a short time span, aviation has progressed to high-altitude flight, flight at supersonic speeds, and flight to space and back. Aviation is integrated into our modern world and has blurred the boundaries of countries, enhanced business and communication across the world, and become an integral part of military operations. Much has been learned in a century of flight, including the importance of aeromedical factors on the safety of flight.",

The most comprehensive source for international medical requirements is updated regularly and can be found on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) website or in its information sources. The ICAO compiles the medical regulations from over 180 contracting states, each with slightly different medical requirements. For specific medical requirements for a particular area, the chief medical officer, or, in the United States, a local flight surgeon or the Federal Aviation Regulations can provide current medical standards. Those requirements and factors that do not change are discussed in this chapter.",

            "text": "Table 1 describes conditions that pose a risk for the safety of flight because poor control or exacerbation of these disease states could adversely affect the pilot's performance of duties. For example, one of the wellknown adverse effects of drugs used for the treatment of diabetes is hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may result in altered mental status, which can adversely impact a pilot's performance. In addition to the disease states listed in Table 1 , other factors should be considered during preflight planning. Acute illness may also reduce pilot performance to an unsafe level. Infection, anemia, peptic ulcer, acute injury, or pain are examples of such conditions. Note that, even when some conditions are treated, the medications used may impair flight performance and cause undue risk. Use of certain medications may be precluded in pilots because they may alter memory, concentration, alertness, and coordination, or otherwise compromise flight performance. Examples of these are listed in Table 3 . Note that, in addition to affecting coordination, memory, judgment, and reaction time, central nervous system depressants predispose the pilot to the effects of hypoxia. Despite widespread knowledge of the effects of certain medications, postmortem toxicological analysis of samples from fatal accidents still indicates that these drugs are commonly used by pilots. A short review of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) cases shows that the drugs most commonly used by pilots involved in fatal accidents are diphenhydramine and ethanol. Use continues despite the well-known impairment of driving performance by diphenhydramine. In a 2012 study retrospectively reviewing postmortem toxicology screens from fatal aviation accidents that occurred between 2004 and 2008, 500 of 1353 pilots who died were found to be taking some type of drug and 92 of the 1353 had ethanol in excess of 0.04 g dl -1 (Canfield et al., 2012) . In a study published in 2000 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, 25 mg diphenhydramine was noted to cause more impairment in driving performance than a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 mg dl -1 .",

The most Table 2 Concise summary of National Transportation Safety Board Investigations where underlying disease states or drug use were determined to be factors in the outcome Case 1 In July 2003, a Piper PA28 was destroyed in daylight hours operating in visual flight conditions and without a flight plan. A witness described the airplane as flying over the airport at an altitude of 180-240 m (600-800 ft) above the ground. The witness reported that the aircraft suddenly turned to the left and flew straight into the ground. The pilot was fatally injured and the aircraft was destroyed. The pilot held a private certificate for singleengine aircraft and was instrument-rated. He had a valid third-class medical certificate and had a total flight time of 657 h, 442.5 of which were in that airplane. He reported on his application for a medical certificate that he did not take medication and he did not have a history of any illness Review of the pilot's medical records revealed that he had a 12-year history of depression. Two days before the accident he was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility for a suicide attempt in which he had ingested 8 Ambien tablets. He had been treated intermittently since 1991 with antidepressants. Because there were no inpatient beds available, the pilot was discharged home after several hours on citalopram (Celexa) Postmortem toxicological analysis showed brain ethanol concentrations of 23 mg dl \u00c0 1 , muscle ethanol 14 mg dl \u00c0 1 , and trace amounts of diphenhydramine, citalopram, fluoxetine, and norfluoxetine in the liver and kidney Case 2 In August 2003, an experimental amateur-built Young Pietenpol Air Camper piloted by a recreational pilot was destroyed on impact with trees and terrain during a landing at a local airport. Visual flight conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and there was no flight plan on file. The pilot survived the accident only to die from his injuries during the following 24 h. The pilot had a recreational pilot certificate with a single-engine land airplane rating and a valid third-class medical certificate. He had 70 h total flight time, 15 of which were flown in the 6 months before the medical certificate was issued There were no witnesses to the accident, but it appeared from the wreckage that the aircraft may have impacted trees with its left wing. Postmortem toxicological analysis (more than 24 h after the accident) revealed that the pilot had ingested diphenhydramine around the time of his last flight Table 1 Summary of some of the requirements for medical certification for an airman certificate -US standards a",

Personal flights for recreational or business had a higher rate of fatal accidents, effectively double that of any other type of flying, such as commercial carriers and military flights. 74% of personal/ business flight accidents resulted in a fatality.

The pilot in command exited the flight deck and was locked out by the first officer who was under emotional distress after allegedly having difficulties with his girlfriend. While it may be years before a full examination of the forensic evidence leads to sufficient conclusion, this accident, where all souls aboard were lost speaks about the importance of emotional health of those in command of the aircraft.

This personal checklist is taught to student pilots from their earliest lessons as part of the preflight checklist.

As altitude increases, the relative amount of oxygen decreases. Those organ systems that are particularly sensitive to hypoxia are the central nervous system, the heart, and the visual system. Because of the relative dependence of rhodopsin formation on the presence of oxygen, night vision begins to deteriorate at a mean sea level (MSL) altitude of 1500 m (5000 ft). This deterioration is more noticeable at night. If supplemental oxygen is not used, the effects of hypoxia progress as altitude increases. The danger in hypoxia is in its indolence. Judgment, memory, alertness, coordination, and ability to make calculations become progressively impaired. The pilot may feel drowsy or dizzy or euphoric and belligerent. These effects can also be produced by the presence of carbon monoxide in the cabinalso a cause of hypoxia in aviation. As hypoxia increases, peripheral vision decreases and tunnel vision can result. Extremities may become cyanotic and have a bluish hue. Lack of judgment and clarity of thought impairs the pilot from correcting the situation. Loss of consciousness can occur in as little as 20 min at an altitude of 5400 m (18 000 ft) MSL without oxygen supplementation, and in as little as 5 min without supplemental oxygen at an altitude of 6000 m (20 000 ft) MSL. At higher altitudes, seconds are available before hypoxia ensues, with rapid loss of pressurization of the aircraft. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration mandates that, at altitudes above 3750 m (12 500 ft) MSL, the flight crew must wear oxygen after 30 min. At altitudes of 4200 m (14 000 ft) MSL and above, all crew must wear supplemental oxygen, and at 4500 m (15 000 ft) MSL all passengers must be provided with supplemental oxygen. For pressurized aircraft, regulations stipulate that, at altitudes above 7500 m (25 000 ft) MSL, a minimum of 10 min of supplemental oxygen must be available for each occupant in the event of rapid decompression. At flights above 10 500 m (35 000 ft) MSL, a quick-donning type of oxygen masks must be worn.",

This unequal pressure can be compounded by the presence of allergic inflammation or an upper respiratory infection can make equalization difficult. This result in ear pain and loss of hearing that can last for several hours after flight. Pain can be minimized by executing the Valsalva maneuver (pinching the nose and attempting to blow through it), by yawning, swallowing, or opening and closing the mouth. For very young passengers, often sucking on a pacifier, nursing, or swallowing can minimize ear discomfort. Tympanic membrane rupture can occur if the pressure difference is excessive.

Orientation is maintained by a combination of systems; by the input of the visual system, the inner ear, or vestibular system, and sensory input from skin, muscles, and joints. With a decrease or lack of vision such as occurs in night flight or during IMC, sensory input from the inner ear and motion and position from gravitational (G) forces become more acute. The sensations of motion and position during various flight maneuvers are often misleading and may compel pilots to believe they are in straight and level flight when they are indeed in a bank or ascending or descending. In flight conditions where visibility is decreased, pilots are trained to ignore sensory input and focus on the information provided by the instruments of the airplane. During training, an instructor trains a student pilot by demonstrating the various forms of disorientation and methods used to prevent these illusions. In low-visibility conditions, failure to fly the airplane by the instruments and follow sensory input leads to disorientation and is one of the main causes of pilot error and accidents during low-visibility flight conditions. Illusions during flight are created when visual scenes and sensory input confuse the pilot. When this happens, pilots are spatially disoriented; they are unable to determine the attitude or motion of the aircraft accurately in relation to the earth's surface. Despite this widely known phenomenon of spatial disorientation, the Federal Aviation Administration Advisory Circular indicates that spatial disorientation as a result of continued visual flight into adverse weather conditions is a common cause or a factor in annual statistics on fatal aircraft accidents. It is not unusual for visibility to be above visual-flightrule (VFR) minimums and a visible horizon to be absent. This is particularly common in night flight, flight in haze, flights over water, or over sparsely populated areas.",

Flying a Piper Saratoga, a high-performance aircraft, on a night flight in marginal night VFR conditions, this accident was like many others. It was not caused by one catastrophic mistake, but by a series of smaller, less severe errors, all leading to spatial disorientation and what is known as the 'graveyard spiral' with impact into the Atlantic Ocean. The pilot, John F. Kennedy Jr., was a relatively low-time private pilot who was not instrument-rated. He had a total of 310 flight hours, 55 of which were at night; 3 h were solo in the aircraft he was flying at the time of the accident. The flight departed late, at night in marginal visual flight conditions after the pilot had worked a full day. There was no flight plan filed, and no contact with air traffic control. Review of radar tracings of his aircraft indicated that the aircraft entered a descent, then a right turn, then a left turn, followed by a descent that ended in the aircraft impacting the water at a descent rate of over 1410 m min -1 (4700 ft min -1 ). Over water, where there were no lights or other horizon for visual reference, the pilot apparently became spatially disoriented and entered into a spiral downward attitude that ended with the aircraft impacting the water. Factors in this accident were determined to be haze, a dark night, and the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane.",

A false horizon may occur when the pilot uses a sloping cloud formation for visual reference. An obscured horizon, a dark scene with ground lights, and stars can disorient pilots and cause the aircraft to be misaligned with the false horizon. Autokinesis occurs when a pilot fixates his/her vision in the dark on a stationary light. When the pilot stares at a stationary light, it will appear to move, and the disoriented pilot may try to align the aircraft with the light. During a rapid acceleration, like that occurring in the takeoff roll, spatial disorientation, also referred to as a somatogravic illusion, can create the illusion of the aircraft being in a nose-high attitude.

By binding to these sites, oxygen binding is prevented and hypoxia occurs. Sources of carbon monoxide in aircraft are limited to those with piston engines, and occur most commonly when airflow over the engine to the heating system becomes contaminated with exhaust fumes from manifold cracks and faulty engine seals. Signs of carbon monoxide exposure include headache, drowsiness, or dizziness, temporally related to the use of the aircraft heating system. A pilot who detects exhaust fumes in the cabin of the aircraft should shut any heating vents, open all vents to provide outside air into the cabin, and have the system examined with due haste. Cockpit carbon monoxide detectors are relatively inexpensive and can help detect faulty engine systems before they present a problem. If carbon monoxide exposure is suspected, it can be confirmed by measuring blood carboxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin concentrations above 20% indicate exposure and are generally considered to be symptomatic. Treatment of carbon monoxide exposure includes removal from the source, oxygen administration, and, in severe cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy that hastens the elimination of carbon monoxide.",

When an aircraft changes speed or direction, the magnitude of acceleration is measured by the G-force. With increasing positive G-forces, blood is forced downward and away from vital areas such as the brain and heart. Pooling blood in the legs and splanchnic circulation can result in loss of vision, and loss of consciousness. This is obviously more of a problem with high-powered aircraft or aerobatic flight than with a slower, less-powerful aircraft. The onset of G-induced hypoxia or loss of consciousness can occur gradually or can be nearly instantaneous, depending on the rate of change in G-force. Much has been published on the syndrome known to military pilots as 'acceleration-induced near-loss of consciousness' or ALOC. The ALOC syndrome seems to be more common with rapid and short-lived changes in G-force. Shortterm memory loss, degradation of vision characterized by light loss, loss of peripheral vision, sensory abnormalities, confusion, euphoria, dysphasia, and reduced auditory acuity are commonly encountered with short rapid changes in G-force. To combat G-force hypoxia and prevent loss of consciousness, early pilots were trained and taught to tense their legs and abdomen and to grunt, yell, or practice the Valsalva maneuver to keep blood in the brain. More sophisticated equipment was developed in the form of pressure suits, or clothing with air bladders that inflate automatically and help maintain blood flow to the brain during high-G-force maneuvers.",
