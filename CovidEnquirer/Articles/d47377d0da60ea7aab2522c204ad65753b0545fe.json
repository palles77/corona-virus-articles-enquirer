These picornavirus species often occur in symptomatic young children from community and hospital populations where they create a sizable burden for management and are a frequent trigger of wheeze. [1] [2] [3] Picornavirus infections can more often be observed among children presenting to an emergency department than other respiratory virus infections. 4 Nearly three quarters of respiratory virus detection episodes during the first 28 days of life are due to RVs and over half are symptomatic. 3 Until recently, much of what is known of RV diversity, epidemiology and clinical impact was determined using human studies and cell culture methods in the 1950s to 1980s. In 2006, the molecular discovery of a genetic clade of RVs that could only be cultured in vitro using sophisticated air-liquid interface cultures was subsequently ratified as a third species, Rhinovirus C (RV-C). 5, 6 To date, RV-C has added 56 distinct RV types to the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. As more is learned, conclusions reached by some earlier studies have required re-examination and confirmation. [5] [6] [7] We aimed to estimate the spectrum of RV genotypes, species seasonality and RV involvement in co-detections in Queensland using a convenience collection of airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001 and tested using molecular tools expected to account for all RV species.",

If a respiratory tract sample is to be collected for any testing and if routine screening of respiratory viruses is to serve its patients best, RV should be a principal component of any acute respiratory illness testing algorithm throughout the year, with allowance for their relative replacement by IFAV cases during winter.

Most RV detections occurred as single detections (n=225; 78.9% of RVs), most often in autumn (when RSV detections also peaked) and spring (when MPV and PIV detections peaked) (Figure 1). Detection of more than one virus occurred in 76 extracts. RVs were the most frequently detected viruses overall and were involved in the greatest total number of co-detections (n=60; 20.3% of all 296 RV positive extracts) (Figure Supplementary Table 4).
