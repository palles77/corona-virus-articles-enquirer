In the tropics, warm climate, poverty, lack of education, and poor sanitation provide an ideal environment for pathogens, vectors, and intermediate hosts to flourish. 1 In this vast landmass, respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Respiratory infections may be due to common pathogens encountered worldwide, as well as mycobacterial, parasitic, and fungal organisms. Infections are more prominent in immunocompromised hosts. On the other hand, non-communicable diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] , chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer, occupational lung diseases) are increasingly recognized in the tropics, where low socio-economic, educational, and nutritional status favor worse prognosis. A reasonable approach to the patient with lung disease in the tropics starts with age, occupational exposure, physical examination, HIV status, chest x-ray, and blood tests.",

In Ethiopia only 30% of children with pneumonia were taken for care in a facility or in the community. 2 WHO data reveal that as few as 39% of newborns are breastfed, 60% of children with suspected pneumonia access care, count or leukopenia in viral infection, and eosinophilia in parasitic infection. When available, chest x-ray, serum procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein can be obtained ( Fig. 1.3) .

Children aged 2-59 months with severe pneumonia should be treated with parenteral ampicillin (or penicillin) and gentamicin as a first-line treatment. Ampicillin: 50 mg/kg, or benzyl penicillin: 50,000 units per kg IM/IV every 6 hours for at least 5 days. Gentamicin: 7.5 mg/kg IM/IV once a day for at least 5 days. Ceftriaxone should be used as a second-line treatment in children with severe pneumonia having failed on the first-line treatment. 4 . Ampicillin (or penicillin when ampicillin is not available) plus gentamicin or ceftriaxone are recommended as a first-line antibiotic regimen for HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants and for children under 5 years of age with chest in-drawing pneumonia or severe pneumonia. For HIV-infected and HIV-exposed infants and for children with chest in-drawing pneumonia or severe pneumonia who do not respond to treatment with ampicillin or penicillin plus gentamicin, ceftriaxone alone is recommended for use as second-line treatment.",
