Thus, reliable methods for characterization of and protection against bioaerosols are necessary to alleviate these concerns. Appropriate sampling is the basic step for bioaerosol characterization. Liquid impingement has been widely used for bioaerosol sampling due to its ability to preserve viability of microorganisms and their suitability for subsequent analytical studies. However, liquid impingers should be used for collection of bioaerosol particles only when inertial impaction of particles into liquid is the dominant collection mechanism, typically for sizes larger than 1 mm in diameter Willeke, Lin, & Grinshpun, 1998) . For instance, the cut-off diameter of an All-Glass Impinger 30 (AGI-30) was reported about 0.3 mm (Lin, Willeke, Ulevicius, & Grinshpun, 1997) . Viral aerosols generated from coughing or sneezing are originally in the size range from 1 to 100 mm, and quickly evaporate to droplet nuclei of 20-300 nm individual viruses (Kowalski & Bahnfleth, 1998; Tseng & Li, 2005) . Due to their small size, viral aerosols are not effectively collected by current liquid impingers. Collection efficiency of an all-glass midget impinger with a standard nozzle was reported to be less than 20% for particles in the size range 20-700 nm (Spanne, Grzybowski, & Bohgard, 1999) . Hogan et al. (2005) also reported that collection efficiencies of an AGI-30 and an SKC Biosampler were less than 10% for particles between 30 and 100 nm. Thus, modifications or new techniques that ensure improved collection of ultrafine virus particles are necessary for the current liquid impingers to be used as reliable sampling devices for viral aerosols.",

The bioaerosol sample flow was passed over the water reservoir at the same temperature of the first heating tube to be saturated with water vapor, and entered the first heating tube, in which the saturation condition was maintained, and then passed through the second cooling tube, in which condensation occurred.

As shown, the mBAU worked effectively as a virus amplification device, and number of viruses collected in the Biosampler increased 2-3 fold at the saturated air temperature (T saturated-air ) of 55-65 1C. The FCEs of the mBAU were 2.0270.48 and 2.2270.64 at T saturated-air of 55 and 65 1C, respectively. Results of the PSD measurements also showed significant growth of virus particles in the mBAU. Fig. 2 shows the changes in PSD of the aerosol flow after the mBAU at different T saturated-air . As can been seen in Fig. 2 , growth of particles was observed at T saturated-air Z55 1C, and changes in PSD were remarkable as T saturated-air increased. More than tenfold increases in particle number concentration (4327 nm) were observed in the viral aerosol flow at T saturated-air Z55 1C (Table 1) . Fig. 3 illustrates the changes in PSD after the mBAU at T saturated-air =65 1C when the particle-free air and the aerosols generated by nebulizing DI water and PSL suspension were used as the sampling flow. For the particle-free air -in which no nuclei were present -not many larger particles were detected after the mBAU. However, for the aerosol generated by nebulizing the DI water-PSL suspension, which contained ultrafine particles, increased numbers of larger particles were observed. This proves that nucleation is not important under the tested condition, and that the particles detected by APS are truly amplified particles rather than nucleated. Considering relatively high concentration of PSL suspension (100 ppm) in the nebulizer, these amplified particles are not solely grown from singlet PSL particles (30 nm), but also from multiplet PSL particles (460 nm) and surfactant residue in the suspension.",

These results indicate that modifications of the current mBAU to ensure rapid mixing are necessary to improve the device's performance. Nevertheless, as shown in Table 1 , the differences between the FCE improvement and the increase in number concentrations of larger particles were remarkable. These differences might mainly be due to the size-dependent collection efficiency of the Biosampler. In other words, the FCE improvement will depend not only on the change of PSDs before and after mBAU, but also the size-dependent collection efficiency of the Biosampler.",

To maintain the viability of MS2, the optimal temperature was approximately 65 1C. In contrast, the cBAU was not a practical amplification device for viral aerosols.
