Prevention of IB is of economic importance to the poultry industry due to the high morbidity and production losses associated with the disease (Cavanagh, 2005) . Although vaccines are now being used widely and extensively, outbreaks of IB still occur frequently due to the epidemic IB virus (IBV) strains (Zou et al., 2010) . It is well known that little or no cross-protection occurs between different serotypes of IBV, and new serotypes may appear in the future, complicating the prevention and control of IB.",

The S glycoprotein is posttranslationally cleaved at protease cleavage recognition motifs into the animal-terminal S1 and carboxyl-terminal S2 subunits by cellular protease (Jackwood et al., 2001; Cavanagh et al., 1986) . The S1 glycoprotein contains epitopes that induce virusneutralizing, serotype-specific antibodies, hemagglutination inhibition antibodies, and cross-reactivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibodies (Niesters et al., 1987) . It also plays an important role in tissue tropism and the degree of virulence of the virus (Casais et al., 2003) . The appearance of these variants hinders the prophylactic strategy carried out by the breeders of the Moroccan poultry farm. In order to solve this problem, we have opted to study the structure of the hypervariable region of the S1 protein of serotype Italy02 and Mass in silico by molecular modeling, where the largest number of epitopes identified by neutralizing antibodies is observed (Koch et al., 1992) .",

These authors have shown that this combination site antigen\u00c0magnesium has a strong relationship with the immune system, both in the nonspecific and specific immune response, also called innate and acquired immune response (Tam et al., 2003) . That is, as a cofactor for the synthesis of immunoglobulins, C 0 3 convertase, immune cell adhesion, antibody-dependent cytolysis, IgM lymphocyte binding, macrophage response to lymphokines, and the adhesion of helper T lymphocytes (Tam et al., 2003) . These data are in accordance with the results described above (Zou et al., 2015) . These authors have demonstrated that this molecule promotes more antigenic and immunogenic power around this active site, giving an immune response of 100% neutralizing antibodies. The reason might be that despite significant differences in the S1 protein, much of the virus genome remains unchanged, and there are common epitopes among different strains of IBV, which play a major role in protective immunity (Cavanagh, 1997) .",
