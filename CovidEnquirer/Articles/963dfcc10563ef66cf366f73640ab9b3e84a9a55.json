[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Two of these studies compared N95 respirators (designed to seal tightly to the wearer's face and filter out very small particles or aerosols that may contain viruses) and surgical masks (used to block large droplets from coming into contact with the wearer's mouth or nose) amongst healthcare workers; one trial found a lower rate of clinical respiratory illness associated with the use of non-fit-tested N95 respirators compared with medical masks, 6 whilst a non-inferiority trial found that masks and respirators offered similar protection to nurses against laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. 5 A trial conducted amongst crowded, urban households found that, despite poor compliance, mask wearing coupled with hand sanitiser use, reduced secondary transmission of upper respiratory infection \u2044 influenza-like illness \u2044 laboratory-confirmed influenza compared with education; hand sanitiser alone resulted in no reduction in this aggregated outcome. 11 Although the remaining five trials found no significant differences between control and intervention groups, there were some notable findings. Household contacts who wore a P2 respirator (considered to have an equivalent rating to an N95 respirator) 'all' or 'most' of the time for the first 5 days were less likely to develop an influenza-like illness compared with less frequent users in one study. 9 Another study found a significant reduction in laboratory-confirmed influenza amongst household contacts that began hand hygiene or hand hygiene plus a mask within 36 hours of the index case's illness. 8 A trial conducted amongst resident university students detected significant reductions in influenza-like illness during weeks 4-6 in the mask and hand hygiene group after adjusting for vaccine receipt and other potential confounders. 10 The requirements for mask \u2044 respirator wearing and subsequent compliance varied by study ( Table 2) ; for example, in MacIntyre's study of healthcare workers in China in December 2008 through January 2009 6 'participants wore the mask or respirator on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks after being shown when to wear it', whilst nurses in Canada wore a mask or respirator during the 2008 \u2044 09 influenza season when caring for patients with febrile respiratory illness and during aerosol-generating procedures. 5 Observational studies",

Such studies have often been used to support infection control guidance for influenza. However, the difficulties in interpreting the observational studies of SARS suggest that they are of limited use for guiding policy on influenza. Firstly, SARS is an unusual acute viral respiratory infection with a very different epidemiology to almost all other respiratory viral infections. It is fundamentally different from human influenza: it rarely infects children, has a long incubation period, transmits little early on, mostly transmits in Cannot distinguish relative contributions of hand hygiene and mask as they were combined.",

Masks and respirators to prevent influenza \u00aa 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd healthcare settings, is not prone to extensive global spread and has only appeared once. Secondly, the studies were poorly designed, had many weaknesses and so were very difficult to interpret. Issues of concern include the use of a non-specific definition for exposure to a SARS patient (e.g. coming within one metre of a patient), inconsistency in providing information about the comparability of cases and controls and collection of data after a lengthy period following the outbreak. Several lacked microbiological confirmation of cases or controls and it would seem likely that a number of the SARS cases were not cases at all. Because all the cases knew they were cases, recall bias was highly likely. The single case-control study that tried to address some of these limitations did not find that inconsistent use of masks or respirators was associated with SARS infection. 13 It is important to note three considerations when assessing the practical implications of the review's findings. Firstly, development of evidence-based guidance about mask \u2044 respirator use is inextricably linked to what is known about how influenza is spread and specific risk factors that can affect transmissibility (e.g. host factors, pathogen factors, environmental factors and particle size). However, this is an area equally fraught with uncertainty; there are limited and conflicting evidence regarding the relative importance and frequency of direct contact, indirect contact, droplet and aerosol modes of transmission. 21, 22 Historically, transmission has been thought to occur principally through respiratory droplets and masks have been used as a barrier against droplets emitted by coughing and sneezing. In the last decade, there has been increasing interest in a possible role for aerosol transmission of influenza and the advisability of filtering respirators to block such transmission. For example, studies have found that infected patients can produce aerosol particles containing influenza virus 23 and that hospital airflow patterns can influence influenza transmission via aerosols. 24 Secondly, although the focus of this review has been on masks and respirators, limiting transmission of influenza in both healthcare and community settings requires a multifaceted approach, of which masks and respirators are but one component. In the healthcare setting, this 'hierarchy of controls' includes administrative controls help to reduce the introduction and spread of infection (e.g. policies to restrict entrance of ill visitors and workers, vaccination of healthcare workers); environmental \u2044 engineering controls (e.g. adequate ventilation); and lastly, use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene. 25 In the community setting, a similarly structured approach is advised. However, during both the planning for an eventual pandemic and the subsequent public health response to the H1N1 pandemic, concern over policy and guidance related to mask \u2044 respirator use has at times seemed to overshadow Almost all HCWs wore N95 respirator or surgical mask in all patient settings. Unadjusted univariate analysis found inconsistent use of masks or respirators not associated with higher risk of SARS in any of the 3 contact settings; multivariate analysis found inconsistent use of >1 type of PPE during direct contact independent risk for SARS.",

We considered employing quantitative techniques, but on analysis found the studies comprised a range of study designs, pathogens, participants, interventions and opportunities for bias and confounding would render any meta- analysis findings open to criticism. A review that included interventions other than mask \u2044 respirator use, experimental laboratory and \u2044 animal-human studies on mask \u2044 respirator efficacy, cost-effectiveness studies and the occurrence of adverse events would present a more comprehensive picture. Several systematic reviews of interventions to limit the transmission of respiratory viral infections and \u2044 or specifically influenza have been undertaken. Most have considered a range of interventions; 29-33 one focused specifically on respiratory protection. 34 Within the boundaries established by our inclusion criteria, our search strategy captured essentially the same studies on masks and respirators that others have identified. Jefferson et al derived pooled estimates of the effectiveness of wearing an N95 respirator (91%) and wearing a mask (68%) for any respiratory viral infection; 29 however, these estimates were derived from the analyses of six SARS studies whose methodology was problematic.

Most of the studies we examined were too small to reliably detect what would be anticipated to be moderate effects. Perhaps, one solution is to fund large multi-centre trials with similar protocols in different sites for multiple years to achieve sufficient power. Protocols should include the collection of detailed exposure data, objective monitoring of compliance and assessment of potential confounders. It may be difficult to design studies employing a control group that does not use any protective equipment (including masks \u2044 respirators), particularly in healthcare settings, as such precautions are routinely recommended.
