Sci., The hybridoma technology for production of monoclonal antibodies circumvents many of the constraints associated with the use of conventional antisera, and consequently broadens the areas of application of antibodies in animal sciences. In the present review, the potential usefulness of monoclonal antibodies in animal production -with emphasis on reproduction -is discussed, including the inherent limitations of the current technology and the improvements that can be foreseen within the next few years. Because of their unique specificity and the fact that they can be produced in virtually unlimited quantities, monoclonal antibodies are an important tool in diagnostics. However, the use of these antibodies does not always guarantee absolute specificity, and the low affinity of many monoclonal antibodies will impose a number of limitations on their use. Monoclonal antibodies can also be used to optimize physiological processes such as growth and reproduction. For this, homologous antibodies will probably offer several advantages over their murine counterparts in terms of effectiveness for passive immunization. Some success has already been achieved in the development of monoclonal antibodies from livestock species. Finally, it is shown that monoclonal antibodies are becoming extremely powerful research tools.",

However, the heterogeneity of the immune response has complicated the use of antibodies as reagents. If the antigen is a complex macromolecule, such as a protein, it will contain many antigenic determinants. Each of these antigenic determinants may trigger specific B-lymphocytes to differentiate and generate clones of plasma cells secreting antibody. Furthermore, a single antigenic determinant can stimulate multiple B-cell clones synthesizing antibodies that vary in specificity and affinity.",

Antisera, therefore, may contain immunogiobulins of varying isotypes, affinities, specificities and biological activities. The quantity and quality varies from animal to animal and even from one bleed to the next in a given animal. This situation is made more complex if the immunizing agent contains minor contaminants of a highly immunogenic nature that are capable of inducing large amounts of an irrelevant antibody. Finally, good antisera are usually available in limited amounts, especially if they have been raised against weak antigens or if it has been necessary to absorb the antiserum to make it specific. Consequently, the production and standardization of specific immunological reagents is a difficult task.",

The basis of hybridoma technology is the immortalization of B-lymphocytes with antibody-producing capacities, but limited in vitro growth characteristics. The lymphocytes are fused with cells from a non-antibody-producing and continuously growing tumour cell line or myeloma cell line so that hybrids continue to secrete antibodies while gaining the immortality of the parent tumour cell. Because each B-lymphocyte produces an immunoglobulin molecule with a fixed specificity, clones derived from hybridized cell populations are homogeneous in nature, and each of the clones secretes an immunoglobulin with a single molecular structure and antigen specificity. Thus, all the antibody molecules secreted by the same cell line exhibit identical specificity, affinity and isotype (class or subclass). The antibodies produced by the fusion procedure are known as monoclonal antibodies, distinguishing them from the heterogeneous polyclonal antibodies obtained by conventional antibody production. Antibody-producing clones may be stored in liquid nitrogen in the viable state Immune response is initiated (a) when an antigen molecule carrying several different antigenic determinants enters the body of an animal. The immune system responds: lines of Blymphocytes proliferate, each secreting an immunoglobulin molecule that fits a single antigenic determinant (or a part of it). A conventional antiserum contains a mixture of these antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are derived by fusing lymphocytes from the spleen with malignant myeloma cells (b). Individual hybrid cells are cloned, and each of the clones secretes a monoclonal antibody that specifically fits a single antigenic determinant on the antigen molecule (Milstein, 1980) . and retrieved at will for culture and production of the corresponding antibody. In Fig. 1 , a comparison is made between the monoclonal antibody technique and the conventional technique to prepare antibodies.",

Firstly, monoclonal antibodies are a homogeneous and permanently-available reagent that can be obtained in large amounts. Another major advantage is that pure antibodies can be obtained even when impure antigens were used to immunize. This is important because many biologically-significant antigens have not been purified to homogeneity. It is even possible to use hybridoma technology to look for antigens whose existence is only suspected, and whose structure and properties are completely unknown. In addition to these obvious benefits, hybridoma technology makes it possible to generate a battery of monoclonal antibodies that react with a particular antigen and to select those antibodies that will be best for a particular task. Individual monoclonal antibodies can be chosen on the basis of their affinity, specificity or isotype.",

Since a monoclonal antibody detects a single antigenic determinant it may be more influenced by conditions that alter the binding properties of the single binding site, and in addition it will not form the lattice-like antigen-antibody structure required for direct precipitation, unless the antigen has more than one identical antigenic determinant (i.e., polyvalent antigen) distributed in a favourable conformation. The utility of otherwise valuable monoclonal antibodies may also be limited by the fact that the antibodies are of a specific subclass and, therefore, restricted to the functions that can be carried out by antibodies of that class. Such limitations may be minor and can often be circumvented, but must be taken into consideration when these reagents are used in place of polyclonal antisera.",

The progesterone concentration in either blood plasma or in milk at oestrus is very low and rapidly rises to a high level at mid-cycle. This level is maintained throughout pregnancy. If a cow does not become pregnant, the progesterone level falls around Day 16-19 after last oestrus. Several enzyme immunoassays for the determination of progesterone have been described in the literature, most of them employing polyclonal antibodies (Arnstadt and Cleere, 1981; Van de Wiel and Koops, 1986) . However, for commercialization, the milk-progesterone test has to be standardized and in that case monoclonal antibodies are the preferred reagents. Several groups have prepared monoclonal antibodies to progesterone (Fantl et al., 1982; White et al., 1982; Booman et al., 1984a) . These antibodies differed considerably in their specificity and affinity for progesterone. The best monoclonal did not detect progesterone with any greater sensitivity than the conventional polyclonal sera. However, the use of monoclonal antibodies leads to improvements in test standardization and avoids the dependency upon animals producing high quality antisera. ImmuCell Inc. (U.S.A.) has designed a rapid progesterone cow-side test based on the antibody with the best characteristics produced in our laboratory. This test can be performed by the farmer himself and the results are known within 4 min.",

Because of the exclusive presence of the H-Y antigen in the mammalian male (Wachtel et al., 1975) and its detection early in embryonic development (Krco and Goldberg, 1976 ) , it has become possible to predict the phenotypic sex of the offspring on the basis of embryonic H-Y antigen expression. Polyclonal antibodies against the H-Y antigen can be raised by injecting female C57BI/6 mice with cells of males of the same inbred strain. Anti-H-Y antibodies of the mouse have been used to identify XY cells in some 70 species from all classes of vertebrates (for references, see Wachtel, 1983 ) . The antigen appears to lack species specificity and, therefore, the antibodies can be used to identify bovine embryos. The H-Y antigen is a weak antigen and immunization with H-Y antigen usually results in the production of low titre, low affinity antisera. Because only a low percentage of mice have a good antibody response and their sera run out quickly, it would be preferable to have monoclonal antibodies. Several monoclonal antibodies have already been developed (Koo et al., 1981; Farber et al., 1982; Shapiro and Goldberg, 1984) . However, the affinity of all these monoclonal antibodies appears to be low. In our laboratory we have been trying to produce specific, high-affinity monoclonal antibodies against the H-Y antigen (Booman et al., 1988a) . Evaluation of bovine embryos for expression of H-Y antigen using these monoclonal antibodies in an indirect immunofluorescence assay has been shown to be reasonably accurate. The assessment of fluorescence, however, is highly subjective. Work must still be done to modify the procedure in such a way that subjectivity is reduced.",

In polyclonal antisera where antibodies are derived from multiple distinct B cell clones, cross-reactivity is a major problem. Although the technique of monoclonal antibody production selects for an antibody with specificity for a single antigenic determinant, this does not always preclude the presence of cross-reactivity. The specificity of an antibody is a quantitative phenomenon that is determined by its affinity for a defined antigenic structure as compared to other antigens. It is clear that the discriminating abilities of monoclonal antibodies are potentially very great, although impossible to pre-dict in advance. The ability to obtain highly-specific antibodies obviously depends on the existence of structural features unique to a given molecule, and on the maximum affinity differences likely to be possible to allow binding to these, but not to modified determinants on other molecules. It is also necessary that such structural features make a significant contribution to the overall immunogenicity of the molecule, although even in this case it is a matter of generating enough monoclonal antibodies to find the right one.",

In a polyclonal antiserum, the majority Of antibodies will also have low affinities, but the few high affinity antibodies will dominate the reaction and provide the necessary sensitivity. However, a monoclonal antibody can exhibit an affinity anywhere within the full range and one must identify those few of sufficient affinity. Some recent evidence has suggested that the high affinity ofpolyclonal relative to monoclonal antibodies may reflect more than a simple statistical incidence of different individual affinities in a large population. Some mixtures of 2 monoclonal antibodies for different antigenic determinants on a given antigen show co-operativity in that the affinity of the mixture is considerably higher than that of the individual antibodies (Ehrlich et al., 1983 ) . If high affinity monoclonal antibodies are of particular importance, the screening assays for selecting relevant antibodies must be designed to exclude low affinity antibodies. All things considered, it is always necessary to evaluate carefully the need for making monoclonal instead of polyclonal antibodies for a given antigen as considerable time and effort is required to obtain monoclonal antibodies with suitable properties.",

Many other, secondary, effects may be a consequence of the immunization,e.g., disturbance of a metabolic network and quantitative alteration in other active substances. There are now many examples showing the physio-logical effects of immunizing animals against hormones; for instance, immunization of sheep to gonadal steroids during the breeding season may raise the ovulation rate (Pathiraja, 1982) resulting in an increased number of lambs born (Land et al., 1982 ) . A possible mechanism that can explain such an effect is that the antisera interfere with the equilibria between gonadotrophin release and gonadal activity (Land et al., 1983) . Immunization against luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone can produce immunocastration and meat quality changes in rams and bulls (Schanbacher, 1982; Robertson et al., 1982) ; somatostatin immunity has been reported to bring about growth changes (Spencer et al., 1983) and immunization against inhibin results in early onset of puberty as well as increased ovulation rate in sheep (O'Shea et al., 1982; Henderson et al., 1984) .",

Within species, and even within breeds, there can be marked variations in the magnitude and speed of antibody response. The effect of active immunization is manifested only in those animals which form adequate titres of antibodies. The effects could be brought about in a repeatable manner by passive administration of preformed antibodies. Also, in contrast to the slow acquisition of antibody titre following active immunization, passive immunization results in an immediate neutralization. The ability to immediately and specifically neutralize hormone activity provides a means of influencing a physiological process at a very precise moment. A good example of this is the administration of (polyclonal) antibodies against pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG) in superovulated cattle immediately after insemination, where the surplus of PMSG is neutralized and consequently the number of embryos of good quality can increase (Bouters et al., 1983 ) . Finally, passive immunization has proved useful in the treatment of certain animal diseases where prophylactic measures are not possible. However, the amounts of antisera required for passive immunization are very large, so that with polyclonal antibodies it is possible to treat only a restricted number of animals. The hybridoma technique offers the possibility of obtaining antibodies of the required specificity and characteristics in unlimited amounts.",

In spite of new mass culture techniques, the production costs of purified monoclonal antibodies are still high so that not all applications are yet economically attractive. Another limitation may be the reaction of the treated animal to the effects of passive immunization. For instance, in the case of anti-steroid antibodies, the animal may restore its hormone level via compensatory production, shifting of equilibria in the steroid pathway and release of steroids from fat deposits (Booman et al., 1984b; Wang et al., 1984) . A third limitation might be the murine or rat origin of monoclonal antibodies when applied in other species. Once these antibodies have been recognized as foreign, an anti-mouse immunoglobulin response may develop which limits the further effectiveness of the monoclonal antibody. In addition, heterologous antibodies may not elicit cooperative cellular effects. As reported by Nose and Wigzell (1983) and reviewed by Larrick and Buck (1984) , antibodies have species-specific carbohydrates which are important in several antibody effector functions.",

Monoclonal antibodies can be applied to define the functional roles of sperm constituents during differentiation and fertilization and to identify and resolve the functions of many regulatory substances with crucial roles in mammalian gametogenesis, fertilization and development (for references, see Bellvd and Moss, 1983 ) . A further consequence of the fact that one particular monoclonal antibody recognizes only one antigenic determinant of an antigen is that monoclonal antibodies may be useful reagents in molecular studies of receptor structure and function (Greene et al., 1980) or in studying the orientation of hormones when bound to their receptors (Moyle et al., 1982) .",

The binding region of the antiidiotypic antibody mimics the architectural configuration of the original antigenic determinant. The mimicry is so accurate that in some cases the antiidiotypic antibody may be utilized in place of antigen for the identification or induction of antibody. It has been suggested by Kelley and Lewin (1986) that this approach could be particularly useful in vaccine production for antigen preparations that might remain infectious after isolation, or for those antigens that are difficult to isolate and to characterize. Anti-idiotypic antibodies might also be used as a tool to mimic the antigen in vitro (e.g., diagnostic assays) or in vivo (e.g., to mimic insulin and cause glucose entry into a cell).",

The immune system responds: lines of Blymphocytes proliferate, each secreting an immunoglobulin molecule that fits a single antigenic determinant (or a part of it). A conventional antiserum contains a mixture of these antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are derived by fusing lymphocytes from the spleen with malignant myeloma cells (b). Individual hybrid cells are cloned, and each of the clones secretes a monoclonal antibody that specifically fits a single antigenic determinant on the antigen molecule (Milstein, 1980).",

Cela ~largit en consequence l'aire des applications des anticorps dans les sciences animales. Dans cette mise au point on discute l'utilit~ potentielle des anticorps monoclonaux dans la production animale en mettant l'accent stir la reproduction, y compris les limites inh~rentes de la technologie actuelle et les ameliorations qui peuvent ~tre envisag~es pour les prochaines ann~es. A cause de leur sp~cificit~ unique, et du fait qu'ils peuvent ~tre produits en quantit~ virtuellement illimitAe, les anticorps monoclonaux sont un important outil diagnostique. Cependant, leur utilisation ne garantit pas toujours une sp$cifi-citA absolue et la faible affinitA de nombre d'entre eux en limtera remploi. Les anticorps monoclonaux peuvent ~tre aussi utilis~s pour optimiser les processus physiologiques tels que la croissance ou la reproduction. Pour cela, les anticorps homologues pr~senteront probablement plusieurs avantages sur leurs contreparties murines en ce qui concerne leur efficacit~ pour l'immunisation passive. On a d~j~ obtenu un certain succ~s dans le d~veloppement des anticorps monoclonaux pour le b~tail. On montre enfin que les anticorps monoclonaux sont des outils de recherche ex-tr~mement puissants. KURZFASSUNG Booman, P., 1988 . Anwendung monoklonaler AntikSrper in der Tierproduktion; ein 0bersichtsreferat. Livest. Prod. Sci., 18:119-215 (auf englisch).Die Hybridisierungstechnik zur Produktion monoklonaler AntikSrper umgeht viele der Beschriinkungen, die bei der Verwendung konventioneller Antiseren auftreten, und erweitert dementsprechend die Anwendungsgebiete yon Antik~irpern in den Tierzuchtwissenschaften. In der vorliegenden (~bersicht wird der mSgliche Nutzen monoklonaler AntikSrper in der Tierproduktion, mit besonderer Berticksichtigung der Reproduktion, diskutiert, einschliei~lich der Begrenzungen der gegenw~rtigen Technologie und den in den n~ichsten Jahren voraussehbaren Verbesserungen. Aufgrund ihrer einzigartigen SpezifitAit und aufgrund der Tatsache, daft sie in praktisch unbegrenzter Menge hergestellt werden kiinnen, sind monoklonale Antikiirper ein wichtiges Hilfsmittel in der Diagnostik. Allerdings garantiert der Gebrauch dieser Antik6rper nicht in allen F~illen absolute Spezifi~t, und die geringe Affini~t vieler monoklonaler AntikSrper bedingt eine Reihe von Anwendungseinschriinkungen. Monoklonale AntikSrper kSnnen auch zur Optimierung physiologischer Prozesse wie z.B. Wachstum und Reproduktion verwendet werden. Dazu bieten wahrscheinlich homologen AntikSrper verschiedene Vorteile gegentiber murinen AntikSrper, was die Effektivita't zur passiven Immunisierung betrifft. Es sind schon einige Erfolge bei der Entwicklung monoklonaler Antik~irper von Nutztieren erzielt worden, Abschliei~end wird darauf hingewiesen, daft monoklonale Antik6rper/iut~erst wirkungvolle Hilfsmittel fur die Wissenschaft darstellen.",
