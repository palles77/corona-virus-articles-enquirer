Thorne Personal protective equipment (PPE) recently has become a rather common acronym in the lexicon of healthcare providers, even though it has been common in the fire services, emergency medical services (EMS), and military for quite some time. Essentially, PPE helps ensure that individuals are safe from physical hazards that they may encounter in their work environment. PPE may be used to protect workers from general environmental threats (e.g., temperature extremes, noise), specific work-related threats (e.g., falling objects, falls from heights), or threats faced in an emergency situation (e.g., hazardous chemical and infectious agents). No equipment is appropriate for all individuals and threats, but it must be selected and properly used according to the setting of use and the level of risk.",

This attack resulted in 12 deaths and more than 4000 persons presenting to the hospital for medical evaluation. None of the casualties was decontaminated before treatment or transport. Retrospectively, 135 prehospital and 100 hospital personnel reported symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure. Fortunately, none required emergency treatment. 1, 2 Eleven physicians caring for the sickest victims (including one in cardiac arrest and one in respiratory arrest) were most affected, and six of them required antidotal therapy. Fortunately, all recovered fully and did not have to cease their patient care efforts due to symptoms. 3 Approximately 80% of victims self-referred to hospitals, which is consistent with U.S. experiences indicating that few victims of chemical contamination events undergo decontamination before arrival at a medical facility. 2, 4 This has caused most jurisdictions to reconsider historical plans that contaminated patients would not be in contact with medical care personnel until they were \"clean.\" EMS and hospital personnel need to be prepared for contaminated patients presenting directly to them and to recognize that in certain situations, PPE may be required to safely provide care.",

            "text": "SARS posed unique risks and challenges to healthcare workers. This novel viral agent with incompletely defined transmission characteristics was controlled in 2002 with aggressive quarantine measures and use of PPE. In the first wave of SARS in Toronto, 79.2% of all cases were acquired in a healthcare setting. 5 Aggressive use of PPE, including N95 masks, barrier precautions, and gloves, was generally effective at preventing spread, although during one difficult and prolonged intubation attempt, at least six providers contracted SARS from a patient despite complying with PPE recommendations. 6 This case led to recommendations that higher levels of PPE may be required during procedures that are likely to generate aerosols or provoke coughing, such as intubation, airway suctioning, positive pressure ventilation, and nebulization treatments. 7 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the RAND Corporation produced a comprehensive \"lessons learned\" report summarizing issues from the 2001 terrorist bombings at the World Trade Center (WTC), anthrax incidents, and the 1995 Oklahoma City Murrah Federal Building bombing. The report, titled \"Protecting Emergency Responders: Lessons Learned from Terrorist Attacks\" describes in detail many of the challenges responders faced (Box 36-1). 8 It is clear from the WTC events that a large number of jurisdictions responding, conflicting messages regarding use of PPE and safety of the environment, and lack of a plan to implement respiratory precautions can complicate a response and potentially place providers at risk. WTC responders continue to suffer respiratory symptoms attributable to exposures at \"ground zero.\" 9",

In the event of a mass chemical exposure, victims will likely self-refer to visible ambulances, call 911 from sites removed from the site of release, or make their way to hospitals, by-passing organized EMS and fire services. This movement of contamination on the bodies of patients essentially causes a \"migrating\" warm zone, causing contamination of previously clean (\"cold\") areas. This migrating contamination may require protective equipment for EMS responders, and appropriate plans and equipment should be in place. The roles and responsibilities of the responders, as well as the equipment required, need to be defined and drilled in advance of an incident. Hospitals, until very recently, usually relied on fire services for patient decontamination at the hospital. These resources, however, are often deployed to the scene of the event and are thus unavailable to support the hospital. Most hospitals have now recognized the need for at least some internal capacity for patient decontamination and are equipping their teams with PPE appropriate for decontaminating self-referred contaminated patients. A few hospital teams integrate with community HazMat teams, necessitating additional training and equipment as the mission then changes from a defensive decontamination response to an offensive response at the scene of release.",

The Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR) maintains a multistate voluntary accounting of hazardous substance releases, excluding petroleumrelated incidents. The Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) database currently involves 15 states. 11 From 1993 to 2001, 44,015 events were recorded: 3455 (7.8%) of the incidents caused injuries, and 74% of victims were transported to a healthcare facility. 4 In another analysis of HSEES data, only 5% of victims required admission to a healthcare facility. 12 The vast majority had self-limited respiratory symptoms. In 2001, the chemicals with highest potential for injury were chlorine (injury occurred in 18.8% of releases), ammonia (18.2%), acids (14.2%), and pesticides (17%). 13 HSEES data from 1996 to 1998 show 348 responder injuries in 126 incidents out of a total of 16,986 incidents (0.7%). Law enforcement officers and firefighters accounted for the vast majority of responder injuries, which usually consisted of nausea and respiratory irritation. Hospital admission occurred in 6.6% of cases. No deaths were reported in this 3-year period. 4 Hospital personnel were injured in 0.3% of the total HazMat events and represented 0.1% of the victims. 4 Six events involved emergency department staff contact with contaminated patients, and five events were HazMat releases at the healthcare facility itself. No provider required hospital admission, and no chemical PPE was used. Other reports of emergency department evacuation and/or provider illness due to off-gassing from contaminated patients have been summarized. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] The most serious of these incidents involve patients with suicidal ingestions of organophosphate pesticides. [14] [15] [16] Exposures to these patients caused at least one provider to require intubation and receive aggressive antidotal therapy due to contact with pesticide in emesis and vapors during patient resuscitation. 14 Patients who have ingested organophosphate may off-gas for days and present an ongoing risk to healthcare workers. 16 NIOSH has documented 46 healthcare worker injuries from pesticide agents between 1987 and 1998. 14 In conjunction with the information from the Tokyo subway sarin attack and the chemical terrorism risk posed by these agents, it is clear that these pesticides present a substantial risk of toxicity from secondary exposures.",

Increasing protection also generally means decreasing mobility, dexterity, and scope of vision. Inherent risks to PPE include trip and fall hazards; a reduced ability to complete tasks; heat stress 19,24-27 ; anxiety 28 ; and seizures, which, although rare, have been reported. 19 Cardiovascular demand is dramatically increased as ensemble weight and heat retention increase. PPE must be selected on the basis that it does not impose unnecessary risks on the provider while at the same time offering an appropriate margin of safety against the chemical hazard. Because the selection of PPE usually revolves around the selection of the respiratory component, various types of respirators must be reviewed. Each respirator has an assigned protection factor that reflects the degree of protection afforded to the user. Simply put, 1/protection factor equals the amount of exposure for the wearer. For example, a provider wearing a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) with an assigned protection factor (APF) of 1000 is exposed to 1/1000 the level of contaminant as compared with wearing no protection.",

Limitations include the equipment's weight (approximately 25 to 30 pounds), cost, need for fit-testing, duration of air supply, and need to refill air bottles. Even though SCBA provides excellent protection, its limitations make it inappropriate for many situations (e.g., caring for a patient with an infectious disease, providing hospital-based decontamination, or securing a perimeter in the warm zone). SCBA has an APF of about 10,000, the highest of any type of respirator. 29 Supplied-air respirators (SARs) provide air via a hose line from a nearby clean air source (e.g., compressor or hospital supply line). To meet OSHA requirements for level B, respirators must have a tight-fitting face piece and an emergency supply of air in case of line failure or problems. 30 Loose-fitting hoods with a supplied air source do not meet level B standards but are used by some decontamination teams when an additional level of protection is desired due to institutional preference or local hazard profile. Advantages include a potentially unlimited supply of fresh air and longer duration of use. Limitations are primarily mobility and thus flexibility of response. These respirators are best suited to healthcare provider use in a decontamination room or a welldefined area in which the air lines are unlikely to be tangled, stretched, or a tripped hazard.

This can lead to confusion and difficult choices for agencies and facilities, knowing that their PPE selection may be either too much or too little to satisfy future standards. Currently, there is no recommendation or consensus on the level of PPE that is required for hospital-based personnel, much to the consternation of hospital preparedness leaders. Some have proposed a PPE level \"H\" to meet this need. More research is clearly needed regarding safe but comfortable PPE, methods of decontamination, modeling of airborne concentrations of specific agents, and PPE selection. Further, detection technologies are needed that can provide better environmental screening for a wide range of hazardous substances and quantitative assessment of agent concentration. Currently, incident commanders may remain confused about appropriate PPE, and this may result in PPE selection that is overly conservative (which risks provider noncompliance and adverse effects from the PPE) or overly liberal (which risks provider injury from the contaminant).",
