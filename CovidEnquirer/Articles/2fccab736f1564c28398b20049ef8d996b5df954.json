These viruses are easily transmitted from person to person, and fomites can potentially act as vehicles for transmission. Nosocomial viral infections are common, with the frequency of respiratory syncytial virus infections between 30% and 70% in neonatal wards and 20% and 40% in pediatric wards. 12 Viruses are estimated to have a variable life span on dry inanimate objects, with viability ranging between 6 hours to 60 days. 13 Many respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza viruses, influenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus, are enveloped and have been shown to survive on surfaces of fomites from several hours to several days. Enteric viruses on the other hand are usually nonenveloped and therefore can remain viable for weeks to months. 2 However, our results are based on PCR detection rather than viral culture; hence, viability and infectivity of the aforementioned viruses are difficult to infer. Therefore, whether this translates to an increased risk of transmission and hence increased nosocomial infection rate remains to be seen. To our knowledge, this is the first study looking specifically at potential viral contamination of ID badges and lanyards in a pediatric population. Our results demonstrate that they are not likely to be significant vectors in the nosocomial transmission of common respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses. This low contamination rate is despite the study coinciding with the peak season for respiratory viruses in both years and also the tail end of the peak of gastrointestinal viruses, where a higher rate of background infection would imply higher risk of transmission and hence colonization on fomites.",

Bean et al demonstrated that influenza viruses isolated from throat swabs could be transferred from nonporous or cloth surfaces to hands for up to 24 hours or 15 minutes, respectively, after contamination. However, this is only feasible with viral titers that exceed physiologic levels of viral shedding. 14 Nonetheless, PCR methods used in this study are likely to detect viral loads below the transmission threshold, even assuming that detected RNA-DNA represents viable viruses. Viral titers have also been shown to decline exponentially with time on inanimate surfaces. Therefore, unless swabs were taken immediately or close to initial contamination of the ID or lanyard, the viral titer could have been too low even for detection by PCR. The implication of this may be similar to the way viruses can become inactivated on human skin and can only survive on hands for a few minutes. 15 Furthermore, respiratory pathogens may be spread via airborne or droplet transmission, but fecal pathogens are predominantly spread via contact transmission. Therefore, unless there is clear surface contact with the lanyard, it is difficult to establish successful transmission, thereby possibly accounting for the lack of any detected fecal nosocomial infections in this study.",
