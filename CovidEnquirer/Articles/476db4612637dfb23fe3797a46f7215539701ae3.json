Objective: To describe the clinical, laboratorial, and radiological characteristics of adenovirus pneumonia and detect the type and diversity of human adenoviruses that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in Beijing. Study design: An etiological study of adult community-acquired pneumonia was carried out prospectively at Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital. A total of 18 cases with laboratory-confirmed adenovirus infections in 487 cases with CAP were observed clinically. The viral type and phylogenetic analysis were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Patients with adenovirus pneumonia typically reported flu-like symptoms. Some of them developed shortness of breath or severe dyspnea on 6 days after disease onset. The patients with ARDS usually present dyspnea, higher level of serum muscle enzymes and bilateral, mutilobal consolidation and patchy/ground-glass opacities. HAdVs type was detected in 17 samples and all of them belonged to species B (HAdV-11, 7, 3 and 14) . Among them, HAdV-11 was most frequently (10/17), followed by HAdV-7 (5/17). Phylogenetic analysis of the partial penton nucleotide confirmed a close relationship with stains circulating in the Beijing region. Conclusions: Our identification of severe respiratory illness due to adenovirus, especially type 11 may highlight the need for rapid diagnosis and improved surveillance, which may assist with targeted development of antiviral agents or type-specific vaccines.",

In addition, some of them develop shortness of breath or severe dyspnea on 6 days after disease onset (range: 5-7 days). Broad-spectrum antibiotics did not work before admission.

However, HAdV-11 was the most common in our study, especially in patients with ARDS. Adenovious type 3, 4, 7 and 14 had been reported to be the causative agent of life-threatening adenovirus pneumonia in immnocompetent adult. 6, 23 To our knowledge, it is the first report about lift-threatening adenovirus pneumonia caused by HAdV-11. Although little is known about mechanisms of pathogenesis of adenovirus infection, type, mutations or recombinations may result in biological or antigenic changes in the type-specific epitopes in the major viral capsid protein, hexon, which can lead to increased virulence. However, by analyzing the partial hexon nucleotide sequences of HAdVs, we found HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14 strains from our study have very close relationship with corresponding type stains circulating in the Beijing region. Therefore, to evaluate the real level of variation among stains, full-length genome or open reading frame (ORF) sequencing is necessary.",

(3) Although repeated testing by PCR, we still failed to identify the typing from one strain in a patient with ARDS. We think the main reason may be due to the low virus DNA copies in the specimen (collected by throat swab). (4) Cidofovir was not available in our hospital.
