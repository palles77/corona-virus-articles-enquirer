Within the first 24 h of life, 27 test calves were experimentally challenged with C. parvum oocysts and 3 control calves were sham dosed. Test calves received 1 of 8 possible doses (25, 50, 100, 500, 1 \u00d7 10 3 , 1 \u00d7 10 4 , 1 \u00d7 10 5 , and 1 \u00d7 10 6 oocysts). All 27 test calves developed diarrhea. Fecal oocyst shedding occurred in 25 (92.6%) test calves and in 0 control calves. The 2 non-shedding test calves both received 25 oocysts. There was an inverse relationship between dose and time to onset of fecal oocyst shedding (P = 0.005). There was no relationship found between dose and duration (P = 0.2) or cessation (P = 0.3) of fecal oocyst shedding. In addition, there was not a significant relationship between log-dose and the log-peak oocysts (P = 0.2) or log-total oocysts (P = 0.5) counted/g of feces across the dose groups. There was a positive dose-response relationship between log-dose and diarrhea (P = 0.01). However, when controlling for other factors, such as onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding, dose was not a significant predictor of diarrhea (P = 0.5). Onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding were found to be the best predictors of diarrhea (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.04, respectively). The ID 50 for fecal oocyst shedding was 5.8 oocysts, for diarrhea was 9.7 oocysts, and for fecal oocyst shedding with diarrhea was 16.6 oocysts. Given that the ID 50 of C. parvum is far less than would be excreted into the environment by a naturally infected calf, prevention and control of cryptosporidiosis is a formidable challenge.",

Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis, which are respectively host-adapted to cattle and people, are recognized as being among the most pathogenic species. Cryptosporidiosis, refers to infection with Cryptosporidium spp., and is primarily characterized by villus atrophy and fusion, intestinal crypt inflammation, and a resultant malabsorptive, maldigestive, osmotic diarrhea. C. parvum infection typically occurs in calves less than 1 month old and impacts calf morbidity and mortality (O'Handley et al., 1999) . Infected calves shed large numbers of readily infective oocysts in their feces which impacts environmental parasite loading (Nydam et al., 2001) .",

The reported ID 50 for C. parvum in immunocompetent neonatal mice is 100-500 oocysts, and in CD1 neonatal mice is 79 oocysts, which is consistent with the doses reported in people (Ernest et al., 1986; Finch et al., 1993) . While experimental infection of livestock is not reported in the literature, studies of natural infection have been conducted. Naturally infected calves experience diarrhea, have a mean onset of fecal oocyst shedding of 16.3 days, and a mean duration of fecal oocyst shedding of 10.5 days (O'Handley et al., 1999) . Though not shown conclusively, a study of naturally infected calves suggested that reduced exposure to C. parvum oocysts resulted in reduced duration of fecal oocyst shedding (Moore et al., 2003) .",

This randomized, double-blinded study was performed at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) from February to March 2011. Thirty calves were purchased at birth from a local dairy farm and enrolled in the study as they were born. Control calves (n = 3) were enrolled concurrently with test calves (n = 30). At least one study author attended all calvings. The perineum of the dam was thoroughly cleaned with povidone-iodine scrub and calves were delivered onto single-use plastic sheets to prevent manure contamination. Immediately after birth, a physical examination was performed and an identification tag was placed in the right ear. All calves were fed 4 L of \u226550 g IgG/L commercial colostrum replacer (Bovine IgG, Colostrum Replacement, Land O'Lakes Inc., St. Paul, MN) within the first 4 h of life via an oroesophageal feeding tube in order to replicate conventional calf management on commercial dairies as best as possible. Commercial colostrum replacer was fed instead of colostrum in order to minimize variability between calves, to limit potential pathogen exposure, and to provide adequate passive transfer of immunity without providing anti-Cryptosporidium specific antibodies. The calves were then transported from the source farm to Cornell University.",

Three calves served as controls and were sham dosed with 0 oocysts. Twentyseven calves were inoculated with one of eight possible doses of a genotyped field strain of C. parvum oocysts. Five calves received 25 oocysts, 4 calves received 50 oocysts, and 3 calves each received 100, 500, 1000, 10,000, 100,000, or 1,000,000 oocysts. All study personnel were blinded to dose group. Control calves (n = 3) were housed in the same facility as test calves, sham dosed, and managed as if they were test calves in order to maintain blinding. Control calves also served as sentinels for cross contamination from test calves, and to help maintain quality assurance in data collection and husbandry practices. To prevent cross contamination, calves were fed and bedded in the same order (youngest to oldest) each day, each calf stall had dedicated equipment and supplies, and all study personnel used single-use personal protective equipment when entering each calf stall.",

When the dose groups are collapsed into 3 dose levels (25 and 50 oocysts, 100-100,000 oocysts, and 1,000,000 oocysts) there is a difference in time to onset across the 3 levels (P < 0.0001). Between dose levels, calves that received 25 and 50 oocysts shed later than calves that received 100-100,000 and 1,000,000 oocysts (P = 0.003 and P = 0.0002, respectively). Fig. 2 shows the probability of onset of fecal oocyst shedding on any given day postchallenge for the 3 dose levels.",

We have determined that in neonatal dairy calves the ID 50 of C. parvum is 16.6 oocysts, depending on which clinical definition of infection is applied. This dose is orders of magnitude less than the number of oocysts typically shed into the environment by naturally infected calves, which has been reported to be in excess of 3 \u00d7 10 10 oocysts in a calf that sheds oocysts for 6 days (Nydam et al., 2001 ). In our current study, calves that received the lowest doses of C. parvum oocysts began fecal oocyst shedding later, and this was associated with fewer days of diarrhea. Given that C. parvum is prevalent in dairy calves, ubiquitous in the environment, and very difficult to kill, its control poses a challenge to dairy farmers (Fayer et al., 1997; Trotz-Williams et al., 2005 , 2007 . In the fecal-oral transmission cycle, knowing that small levels of exposure can result in a large amount of fecal oocyst shedding, and not knowing exactly how many oocysts a calf is exposed to on any given day, poses the greatest challenge for control. However, it is very likely that calf exposure greatly exceeds the ID 50 we have reported. Therefore, findings from this study suggest that unless C. parvum is completely eliminated from the environment, it will be very difficult to reduce the incidence of cryptosporidiosis.",

A study of healthy human volunteers reported an average onset of fecal oocyst shedding of 9 days (DuPont et al., 1995) . We found an inverse relationship between onset of fecal oocyst shedding and dose. Calves that received smaller doses began shedding later, which was also found in a prior study (Zambriski et al., 2013) . Likewise, a DuPont et al. (1995) report a relationship between onset of fecal oocyst shedding in people and size of oral inoculum, i.e., at higher doses, infection tended to occur sooner and last longer. Other studies in calves and people have reported different relationships between duration of fecal oocyst shedding and dose (DuPont et al., 1995; Moore et al., 2003) . In a study by Moore et al. (2003) , an association between dose and duration of fecal oocyst shedding is reported. In that study, 32 of 75 calves died, and among the 8 calves necropsied, all were found to have co-infection with Salmonella spp., rotavirus, and coronavirus, in addition to C. parvum. Therefore, it is possible that the relationship reported between dose and duration of fecal shedding was influenced by co-infection. In the study conducted in healthy human volunteers challenged with C. parvum, a non-statistically significant relationship was reported between dose and duration of oocyst excretion, but the authors do not discuss possible reasons for this association. With respect to enteric symptoms, Moore et al. (2003) report an inverse relationship between onset of diarrhea and duration of diarrhea in calves, and DuPont et al. (1995) report a relationship between dose and occurrence of enteric signs. Our study found a positive relationship between dose and diarrhea, but in the final model, onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding were found to be better predictors of diarrhea. This can be explained in part by the parasite life cycle and associated pathology of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Calves that shed sooner or longer, may be more likely to experience a longer auto-infective stage, or may experience more and recurrent villus damage over time, both of which could result in a longer time to recovery and healing of the GI tract and a longer and more severe episode of diarrhea.",

In outbred neonatal CD1 mice it is 79 oocysts, and is as low at 60 oocysts in wild-type neonatal mice (Finch et al., 1993; DuPont et al., 1995) . Immunosuppressed Mongolian gerbils become infected when challenged with 100 C. parvum oocysts (Baishanbo et al., 2005) .

Thus, when this research is translated to field settings, it is possible that it is an overestimation of ID 50 and the dose-response relationship, and that more severe clinical outcomes could occur. Given that none of the control calves developed diarrhea or fecal oocyst shedding, it is unlikely that cross contamination occurred between challenged calves or that the challenged calves were exposed to oocysts in any quantity greater than their initial challenge dose.",

The degree of fecal oocyst shedding associated cryptosporidiosis is dramatically disproportionate to the ID 50 of C. parvum, which contributes to environmental loading and infection of subsequent calves. This study showed that calves receiving a lower dose began to shed oocysts later, and this was associated with less diarrhea. However, while these calves fared better from a clinical perspective, there was no difference in the log-total or log-peak oocysts counted/g of feces across all doses, meaning that regardless of the level of exposure, the degree of environment loading is unaffected. Therefore, the best method of controlling cryptosporidiosis is to prevent exposure entirely, however, in settings where this is not feasible, keeping exposed calves clean, dry, and nourished will minimize the impact of disease on calf health and wellbeing (Ollivett et al., 2012) .",
