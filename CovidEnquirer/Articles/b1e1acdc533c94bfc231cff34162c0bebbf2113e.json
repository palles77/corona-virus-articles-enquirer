Subcomponents of microorganisms may also be used as antigens in vaccines. For example, toxoid vaccines are made from inactivated toxic components and offer protection from the effects of the infection. Additionally, fragments or subunits of an attenuated or inactivated microorganism can also be used as the basis of an antigenic response to a vaccine. Subcomponents may also be used for other purposes. For example, poorly immunogenic components of microorganisms can be improved by their conjugation to proteins that typically are toxins. This approach is often used in conjunction with polysaccharides, which form the outer coat of some infectious bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine. Immunization with DNA plasmids and virus vectors involves vaccines that encode an antigen protein that are subsequently expressed within cells of the recipient following administration of the vaccine. Monovalent vaccines are designed to provoke an immune response to a single antigen or microorganism. Multivalent or polyvalent vaccines are meant to evoke immune responses to several antigens or microorganisms; however, when various antigens are combined, both synergistic and inhibitory interactions are potential outcomes in terms of the immunological response.",

These cells serve to inhibit immune responses that are potentially harmful by inhibiting or increasing Th1 or Th2 activity. Treg activity is believed to play a role in controlling autoimmune diseases that could possibly arise from wayward responses to the antigen contained in vaccines through antigen-spread response. An interaction between vaccine antigens and adjuvants with Treg is likely but remains unclear and requires further research [1] . Both the generation and maintenance of B and CD8+ T cells are governed by the activity of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes, and these cells are frequently subdivided into T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) subtypes.",

With respect to the latter, Authier et al. [32] examined whether differences in Th1-or Th2-biased immunity could influence the expression of MMF in a rodent animal model. These authors found that Lewis rats with a Th1-biased immune response differed in their reaction to aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted vaccine from Sprague-Dawley rats, which have a more balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. Lewis rats demonstrated significantly smaller MMF lesions than Sprague-Dawley rats. In another study, monkeys given diphtheria-tetanus vaccines containing aluminum adjuvants were found to have varying degrees of macrophage aggregation at the site of injection, although no evidence of either behavioral or muscular weakness was evident [33] .

Alum has the propensity to induce effective levels of antibodies mediated by Th2 responses, but has little capacity to stimulate cellular responses mediated by Th1 mechanisms. The latter is an important aspect of immunity for some newer efforts in the development of vaccines [35] . Additionally novel adjuvants address the need to develop more powerful antibody responses in human populations with insufficient responses to vaccines using alum, such as the newborn, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. They also reduce the amount of administered antigen (antigen sparing).

Changes in the arterial response to hyperemia were accompanied by small increases in CRP and fibrinogen levels, which were considered to be indicative of a systemic inflammatory response to the vaccine. Dilatory responses to sublingual glyceryl trinitrate and carotid intima-media thickness as measured by external ultrasound were not altered. Similarly, Hingorani et al.

Beyond influences on cardiovascular physiology, changes in underlying cytokine levels were reported to be factors in alterations of negative mood affect following administration of the S. typhi vaccine [47, 48] , which may be linked to the direct influence of the inflammatory actions of vaccines on malaise, lethargy, and impaired cognitive ability sometimes observed in clinical populations.",

The incidence of autoimmune-induced disease is low, and in many cases cannot be reliably associated with the administration of vaccines. Although no unequivocal associations are known, various possible pathogenic mechanisms exist. Molecular mimicry is the result of an immune response to shared epitopes between antigens of the host and antigenic components of the vaccine. To assess this potential toxicity, protein sequences may be screened in computer base searches of amino-acid structures between antigenic protein components and known protein structures. Another possible mechanism for the autoimmune phenomenon is epitope spreading. Three different types of this are believed possible: shared identical amino-acid sequences between peptides and/ or proteins, homologous but nonidentical amino-acid sequences, and epitopes on dissimilar chemical structures such between DNA and peptides or carbohydrates and peptides.",

Molecular mimicry of T cells differs from that mediated by antibodies. Mimicry for T cells is a type of immune degeneracy in which T cells recognize and respond to untoward antigens. T cells may exhibit epitope spreading as a response, which is not directed at the original epitope, but as recognition of epitopes in target-tissue proteins expressed in the inflammatory process caused by the vaccine. Additionally, other theoretical mechanisms exist. These include activation by superantigens of a large fraction of T-cell populations and induction of inflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules.

Sources of glucose include digestion of dietary carbohydrates, break down of glycogen in the liver (glycogenolysis), and production of glucose from amino-acid precursors in the liver (gluconeogenesis).

Changes in blood glucose levels due to test-article treatment could be an indication of an adverse event through the above-mentioned pathways. 3. Liver function (alanine animotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), total bile acids, alkaline phosphate (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and total bilirubin). Injury to liver parenchymal cells can be detected by measuring the hepatocellular leakage enzymes (ALT, AST, SDH, and GLDH). Enzyme leakage from cells through damaged cell membranes is indicated by the increased serum activity of these enzymes. Cholestasis, which implies impairment of bile flow, is diagnosed by the changes in ALP and GGT levels. Cholestasis will result in elevations of bilirubin in blood if it is severe. The main value of these enzymes is their greater sensitivity for this abnormality as compared to serum bilirubin levels alone. Gammaglutamyl transferase is more specific than alkaline phosphatase for this purpose. 4. Muscle enzymes (AST (used also as liver injury marker, see above), creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase). Creatine kinase, present in high concentration in the cytoplasm of myocytes, is the most widely used enzyme for evaluation of neuromuscular disease and is a \"leakage\" enzyme. This enzyme functions by making ATP available for contraction in muscles. This is done by the phosphorylation of ADP from creatine phosphate by catalyzing the reversible phosphorylation of creatine by ATP to form phosphocreatine + ADP. Phosphocreatine is the major storage form of highenergy phosphate in muscle. Lactate dehydrogenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of lactate to pyruvate. It is not tissue-specific, being found in a variety of tissues, including liver, heart, and skeletal muscle. Lactate dehydrogenase levels could be elevated by exercise, liver disease, muscle disease, and neoplasia.",

Ammonia, generated by catabolism of amino acids derived either from digestion of proteins in the intestines or from endogenous tissue proteins, is used by hepatocytes to synthesize urea. Urea is excreted by the kidney and intestine and in saliva and sweat. Plasma urea nitrogen concentrations depend on hepatic urea production and renal tubular flow rate. Increases in protein catabolism and digestion and decreases in GFR cause an increase in urea nitrogen levels. Plasma urea nitrogen levels are decreased when protein intake is decreased, protein anabolism, increase in excretion, and decrease in production (eg, liver disease). Muscle metabolism results in the production of creatinine. An energystoring molecule in muscle called phosphocreatine undergoes spontaneous cyclization to form creatine and inorganic phosphorous. Creatinine is the result of creatine decomposition. 6. Proteins (total protein, albumin, globulin, and A:G ratio). Total protein and albumin are the measured parameters, and globulins and A:G ratio are calculated from them. Quantitative values for the above major proteins are the test results. However, there are many different types of proteins within the globulin fraction besides immune globulins, such as those associated with the acute-phase response, and this measurement does not provide information on these fractions. Both quantitative and qualitative data for the different fractions that comprise total protein could be obtained by electrophoresis. Electrophoresis can be used on serum, urine, or body-cavity fluid samples (eg, cerebrospinal fluid). 7. Lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol). In serum, triglycerides are incorporated into lipoproteins that are composed of a coat of phospholipid, cholesterol, and proteins (apolipoproteins) enclosing a hydrophobic center of cholesterol esters and triglycerides. The most commonly occurring steroid is cholesterol. Cholesterol is a precursor of cholesterol esters, bile acids, and steroid hormones. It is derived from dietary sources and synthesized in vivo from acetyl-CoA in the liver (main site) and other tissues (intestines, adrenal glands, and reproductive organs).",

Packed cell volume (PCV) is a directly measured value obtained from centrifuging blood in a microhematocrit tube in a microhematocrit centrifuge. Hemoglobin concentration (Hb) is reported as grams of hemoglobin per deciliter of blood (g/dL). Hemoglobin concentration of whole blood normally is about one third of the HCT (ie, the MCHC is 33%) because red cells are approximately 33% hemoglobin. The MCV, expressed in femtoliters (fL; 10 \u221215 L), indicates the volume of the \"average\" red cell in a sample. Mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) represents the absolute amount of hemoglobin in the average red cell in a sample and its units are picograms (pg) per cell. The MCH is calculated from the Hb and the RBC values using the following equation: MCH (pg) = (Hb \u00d7 10) \u00f7 RBC. The MCHC is the mean cell hemoglobin concentration, expressed in g/dL. It is calculated from the Hb and the PCV using mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) = (Hb \u00f7 PCV) \u00d7 100. The term \"hypochromic\" is used for red cell populations with values below the reference interval. This can occur in a strongly regenerative anemia, where an increased population of reticulocytes with low Hb content \"pulls\" the average value down. Low MCHC can also occur in iron deficiency anemia, where microcytic, hypochromic red cells are produced because of the lack of iron to support hemoglobin synthesis.",

The more immature the cell, the more RNA it contains. In contrast, mature red blood cells, which are no longer synthesizing hemoglobin, contain very small amounts or no RNA.",

Fibrinogen (factor I) [75] is synthesized by the liver and is soluble plasma glycoprotein that is converted by thrombin into fibrin during blood coagulation. To form a clot, fibrin is then cross-linked by factor XIII. It has been shown, in recent research, that fibrin plays a key role in the inflammatory response and development of rheumatoid arthritis. Prothrombin time is a blood test that measures the time it takes for plasma to clot, to check for bleeding problems, or to check whether medicine to prevent blood clots is working. Activated partial-thromboplastin time is used to detect abnormalities in blood clotting [76] and to monitor the effectiveness of heparin treatment.",

            "text": "Since the early 1990s, a new approach to vaccination has been actively developed. These novel approaches include the direct introduction of plasmid DNA containing the gene encoding the antigen against which an immune response is sought by incorporating antigens into appropriate host tissues and the in situ production of the target antigen(s). The advantages of this approach over traditional approaches are that it stimulates both B-and T-cell responses, the vaccine has improved stability, the absence of any infectious agents, and the relative ease of large-scale manufacture [93] . Vaccines are generally used as biological medicinal products for the prophylaxis of infectious disease, but DNA vaccines are also being developed for therapeutic use (eg, against infectious disease or other diseases such as cancer). Using genes from a variety of infectious agents, including influenza virus, hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, rabies virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, West Nile virus, malaria, and mycoplasma, many scientific publications [93] explore the potential of DNA vaccination and immune responses in animals. For nucleic acid and viral vector-based vaccines, biodistribution studies are necessary to determine the tissue distribution following administration and the potential for the vector to integrate into the host genome [93, 94] . The design of nonclinical safety tests should take into consideration the use of the DNA vaccine and the risk/benefit situation. In addition to following GLP requirements for preclinical toxicology studies (see above), DNA studies should also evaluate any local inflammatory response (eg, myositis), organ-specific autoimmunity, immunopathology, and other relevant parameters. In particular, where the encoded antigen is a self-antigen, or may show self-antigen mimicry, a wider range of studies (including autoantibodies) may be necessary to address the specific concerns [93] .",

He also confirmed that an old culture of P. multocida (chicken cholera) kept in the laboratory without passage could protect chickens against virulent P. multocida challenge [95] . The concept of vaccinating dogs against rabies was also discovered by Pasteur [96] . Other examples of animal usage in vaccine research include the use of virus-like particles (VLPs) for immunization against papillomavirus [97] . To control the disease caused by bovine, canine, and rabbit papillomavirus, recombinant papillomavirus VLPs was used [98, 99] . This provided the basis for subsequent licensure of a bivalent and quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to prevent cervical cancer [100, 101] . It has been confirmed through the development of this vaccine that studies in animals remain relevant to the control of infectious diseases in humans. Animal models in human vaccine development have different applications, such as: Whether the study is intended to study toxicology or measure the efficacy of a new vaccine, selecting the right animal model is critical. For instance, a limited number of hosts including nonhuman primates, germfree or barrier raised piglets, germ-free dogs and cats will be colonized by Helicobacter pylori. Investigators prefer working with small animals to larger animals. For example, the ferret has been successfully used to investigate gastritis and antimicrobial agents and Helicobacter felis mice have been used as an animal model for the study of H. pylori [103] .",

Although frequently used, it does have limitations in the study of the etiology of infection and disease pathogenesis. Murine models are suitable to study acute extracellular bacterial infections, but they are of limited value for the study of intracellular viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections [2] . The value of mice and rats as models to study most intracellular infections is limited because of the complex and unique etiology of intracellular infections and the narrow host range of infectivity of individual pathogens [2] . Exceptions to this general concept are a small number of specific intracellular murine infections, like the one involving lymphocytic choriomeningitic virus infection [105] , which has yielded unique insights into the understanding of protective immunity and intracellular infection.",

Thus cats were considered a good model to test protection against disease and death due to highly pathogenic avian-origin strains. H1N1 virus causes a moderate level of disease in cats when infected intratracheally, replicating primarily in the lungs but can also be isolated from other organs [137] .

Studies in the mouse model have suggested that vaccine responses may be compromised in these age groups. The development of the murine immune system may not provide an appropriate model for evaluating immune responses in these two age groups. To evaluate vaccine immune responses in the neonate, and to address questions regarding possible interactions between vaccines and maternal antibodies, large-animal models may be much more appropriate [172\u2212174] . However, other than mice, there have been very few investigations of vaccine responses in geriatric animals [175, 176] . For the screening of adjuvants, the horse could provide geriatric populations [177] . An appropriate animal model is also needed for the development of mucosal vaccines. Disease protection against a wide variety of pathogens that invade through mucosal surfaces could be achieved by mucosal vaccination. Difficulties associated with efficient vaccine delivery and weak immune responses following mucosal immunization made the induction of protective immune responses at mucosal surfaces an elusive goal. Thus for the evaluation of mucosal vaccine-delivery technologies, effective and safe mucosal adjuvants, and the characterization of mucosal immune responses, an appropriate animal model is required. In mice, intranasal vaccination may be associated with inhalation and ingestion of vaccine antigens. This makes it difficult to discriminate between intranasal, oral, and intrapulmonary vaccination. However, larger animals like the pig or the cow can be used for the controlled delivery of vaccines to the nasal passages [178, 179] . The nasal passages of these animals more closely resemble that of humans than do those of the mouse. Surgical models have also been useful for screening a variety of mucosal vaccine delivery technologies and potential mucosal adjuvants [180, 181] .",

The same route of exposure should be used. If the respiratory tract is the pathogens' route of entrance, then the aerosol challenge to expose the pathogen to the defenses of the upper respiratory tract should be used. Intratracheal challenge would not be considered appropriate, because it circumvents the various barriers of the upper respiratory tract. A similar pathogen dose to that which would occur naturally should be used. Use of excessive pathogen challenge, or an unnatural route of infection, might overcome the adaptive immune response.

Unlike toxicity studies, which explore the potential for unanticipated risk, or further refine the understanding of adverse effects, product characterization studies emphasize, quantify, and examine aspects that are associated with the properties of vaccines such as potency and are important to the consistent and safe manufacture of vaccines. In some respects, these studies may be considered to be focused toxicity studies that have restricted or narrow endpoints that include survival or clinical signs. Among the most important are tests for potency, general safety (21CFR610.11), neurovirulence (IABS Scientific Workshop on Neurovirulence Tests for Live Vaccines, WHO, 2005), tumorigenicity (Meeting Report, WHO Study Group on Cell Substrates for Production of Biologicals, WHO, 2007; European Pharmacopoeia Section 5.2.3), and pyrogenicity (21CFR610.13).
