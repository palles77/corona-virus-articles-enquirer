We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.",

As of January 30, a total of 9976 cases had been reported in at least 21 countries 2 . Early detection of COVID-19 importation and prevention of onward transmission are crucial to all areas at risk of importation from areas with active transmissions (Gilbert et al., 2020) . To contain the virus, Wuhan was placed under lockdown with residents not allowed to leave the city on January 23. On the same or the next day, most public transportation stopped in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. In addition, most cities in Hubei province had adopted blockade measures for Class A infectious diseases by January 28 3 . Residents in those areas are highly encouraged to stay at home and not to attend any gathering activity. Besides, at least 207 cities in China have adopted similar though softer measures by February 12. People are frequently reminded by media and community workers to maintain safe social distance. Furthermore, many cities require that recent visitors to high COVID-19 risk areas quarantine themselves at home or in designated facilities for 14 days. Residents who have symptoms of fever or dry cough are required to report the situation to community, and are quarantined and treated in special medical facilities. Governments also trace and isolate contacts of those patients.",

In this paper, we estimate how the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in a city is influenced by the number of new COVID-19 cases in the same city, other cities, and Wuhan in the preceding first and second weeks, respectively. China's large scale quarantine policy takes effect in late January. We also test whether this policy succeeds in delaying the spread of COVID-19 using a 14-day rolling window analysis between January 19 and February 15.",

This pattern implies that for a linear equation of new cases on the number of cases in the past, the unobserved determinants of new infections are serially correlated. The unobserved determinants of new cases may be serially correlated, also because they measure persistent factors, such as people's habit and government policy. Serial correlations in errors give rise to correlations between the lagged number of cases and the error term, and ordinary least square (OLS) estimator may be biased. Combining insights in Adda (2016) and the existing knowledge of the incubation period of COVID-19, we construct instrumental variables for the number of new COVID-19 cases in the preceding two weeks. Weather characteristics in the previous third and fourth weeks do not directly affect today's number of new COVID-19 cases after controlling for the number of new COVID-19 cases and weather conditions in the preceding first and second weeks. Therefore, our estimated impacts have causal interpretations. We use the Lasso method to select instrumental variables among eleven weather characteristics that have the highest predictive power for the average number of new confirmed cases during each of the past two weeks. Furthermore, we examine the moderator effects of socioeconomic factors on the transmission of COVID-19 in China, which include population flow out of Wuhan, the distance between cities, GDP per capita, number of doctors, and contemporaneous weather characteristics. We focus on the effect of population flows from the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak, because data on real time travel between cities have recently become available and we examine whether it can explain the disease spread, and that Wuhan is a major city and a transportation hub with significant population movements.",

Our empirical estimation based on real numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases suggests that one new infection case can decrease the number of new cases by 0.097 (0.438) in the following first (second) week in the February 2-15 subsample, corroborating the effectiveness of China's large-scale quarantine policy. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the empirical model. Section 3 discusses our data and the construction of key variables. The results are presented in Section 4.

We exclude Wuhan from our analysis because the epidemic patterns in Wuhan are significantly different from those in other cities. Some confirmed cases in Wuhan contracted the virus through exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is the most probable origin of the virus 4 . In other cities, infections arise from human to human transmissions. The health care system in Wuhan faced the challenge of previously unknown virus infections in early January and became overwhelmed as the number of new cases increased exponentially from mid-January. These factors may cause severe delay and measurement error issues in the number of cases reported in Wuhan. We alleviate the measurement error problem using variations in the infections caused by exogenous changes in weather conditions which is discussed in detail in Section 3.2.",

To mitigate such potential measurement errors in our estimates, we exclude all cities in Hubei province from the regression. The bottom panel of Table 3 reports the estimates.

To alleviate this concern, we use a measure of the size of population flow from Wuhan to a destination city, which is constructed by multiplying the daily migration index on the population flow out of Wuhan (Figure 2 ) with the share of the flow that a destination city receives provided by Baidu (Figure 3 ).

The effects are robust with the inclusion of other measures of proximity, such as those based on geography and economic similarity. Table 8 shows variables that affect transmissions within cities and whose coefficients are statistically significant at 0.1. In order to help compare across variables, we compute the changes in the variables needed in order for the coefficient of past infections on current cases to be reduced by 1. The effects of the environmental factors and population density are mixed. We also observe that the transmission rate is lower in cities with more doctors.

Countries other than China are reporting new confirmed cases, and increasingly many cases arise through community transmissions rather than being imported. Based on case data in China between January 19 and February 15, we show that public health measures adopted can effectively contain the virus outbreak, and newly available data on real-time population flows can be a valuable tool for risk assessment by public health authorities and the general public.",

(1) and (2), the dependent variables are the numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in the own city in the preceding first and second weeks, respectively. In Columns (3) and (4) Weather conditions affect disease transmissions either directly if the virus can more easily survive and spread in certain environment, or indirectly by changing human behavior. In our sample period, higher wind speeds or more precipitation decrease the number of infections in the future. Higher temperatures increase local infections, but decrease infections in other cities.",

Its value depends on the model used and factors that affect disease transmissions such as the behavior of the susceptible and infected population. Intuitively, it can be interpreted as measuring the expected number of new cases that are generated by one existing case. It is of interest to note that our estimates are at the lower end of the range. One more case leads to 1.465 more cases in the same city in the next week (1.517 if cities in Hubei province are excluded).

This paper examines the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus 2019, considering both within-and between-city transmissions. Changes in weather conditions induce exogenous variations in past infection rates, which allows us to identify the causal impact of past infections on new cases. We use a machine learning method (Lasso) to select instrumental variables with strong predictive power for the endogenous variables. The estimates show that the positive effect of an infection in generating new local infections is observed within one week, and there is evidence that people's responses can break the chain of infections. Comparing estimates in two half samples, we observe that the spread of COVID-19 has been effectively contained by early February, especially for cities outside Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak. Data on real-time population flows between cities have become available in recent years, after aggregating location data from various sources of individual mobile phone users. We show that this new source of data is valuable in explaining between-city transmissions of COVID-19, even after controlling for traditional measures of geographic and economic proximity.",
