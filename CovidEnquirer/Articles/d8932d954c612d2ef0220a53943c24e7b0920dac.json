The use of surgical masks as a means of source control has not been quantified in terms of reducing exposure to others. We designed an in vitro model using various facepieces to assess their contribution to exposure reduction when worn at the infectious source (Source) relative to facepieces worn for primary (Receiver) protection, and the factors that contribute to each. In a chamber with various airflows, radiolabeled aerosols were exhaled via a ventilated soft-face manikin head using tidal breathing and cough (Source). Another manikin, containing a filter, quantified recipient exposure (Receiver). The natural fit surgical mask, fitted (SecureFit) surgical mask and an N95-class filtering facepiece respirator (commonly known as an \"N95 respirator\") with and without a Vaselineseal were tested. With cough, source control (mask or respirator on Source) was statistically superior to mask or unsealed respirator protection on the Receiver (Receiver protection) in all environments. To equal source control during coughing, the N95 respirator must be Vaseline-sealed. During tidal breathing, source control was comparable or superior to mask or respirator protection on the Receiver. Source control via surgical masks may be an important adjunct defense against the spread of respiratory infections. The fit of the mask or respirator, in combination with the airflow patterns in a given setting, are significant contributors to source control efficacy. Future clinical trials should include a surgical mask source control arm to assess the contribution of source control in overall protection against airborne infection.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, the appearance of novel airborne viruses and the reemergence of tuberculosis have posed major public health threats. The most appropriate means of protection, for health care workers (HCW) against such threats, is not well defined. [1, 2] Some studies have suggested the use of surgical masks for HCW as inhalational barrier protection. [3, 4] However, surgical masks are neither tested nor certified for use as respiratory protective devices. They are classified under United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 CFR 878.4040, as a general classification of medical apparel intended to protect both patients and persons in contact with patients from transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate materials. Respirators, in contrast, are designated as inhalational protection devices. [5] [6] [7] Regulatory recommendations are often based on in vitro assessments of filtration efficiency. [8] [9] [10] However, clinically relevant in vivo studies are limited and may not reflect the in vitro data. [11] For example, studies conducted during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks failed to show significant differences in rates of infection between HCW wearing surgical masks or respirators. [4, 12, 13] In addition, in vitro studies have shown that N95 respirators and surgical masks may underperform when challenged with viruses of smaller particle sizes such as influenza. [8, 14] Reponen et al. reported that the physical size of the SARS coronavirus and influenza virus classifies them as highly penetrable through both surgical masks and N95 respirators. [14] Both masks and respirators are defined as Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for their distinct protective benefits, but both National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) characterize PPE as \"the last line of defense, \" encouraging administrative and engineering controls to mitigate Figure \uf6dc. Model of source manikin, receiver manikin, and environment interplay. Model of source manikin, receiver manikin, and environment interplay. Parameters can be set or measured. Dilution is an effect of the environment on the concentration of produced aerosols. Filtration (capture efficiency) is a function of the mask used and takes place at both the source and receiver. Particles that are not captured can be deflected (outward leakage around the faceseal perimeter) by the mask at the source and carried away from the receiver by the environmental flow. Breathing patterns simulate adults with tidal breathing or coughing. environmental exposure. Our study assesses the efficacy of surgical masks in providing secondary protection to healthcare workers and others in relation to masks and respirators used for personal protection.",

Their model included filtration effects but they also looked at the interaction of a number of other important factors. [15] As shown in Figure 1 , they included environmental airflow in the room and mask protection, both deflection (e.g., face seal leakage) and filtration effects, with masks placed on either the infectious Source or the Receiver. The contribution of deflection (outward leakage around the faceseal perimeter) was determined comparing N95 with and without a Vaseline seal. They found that source control (mask on the Source) was often 3-300 times more effective than a mask on the Receiver. Interactive factors in that study were limited to tidal breathing, negative pressure room effects, and use of a hard plastic manikin. To further study the model of Diaz and Smaldone, using a new soft realistic manikin, we expanded the in vitro bench model to test three airflow environments during tidal breathing and coughing.",

[18] Proper direction of flow in the negative pressure room was checked using smoke tests. Chamber flow in ft 3 /min (CFM) was adjusted by regulating the fans using a balonometer (model 6200D; Alnor, Huntington Beach, CA). CFM was converted to air exchanges per hour (ACH) using the formula: ACH = (CFM x 60 min)/(Room Volume in Cubic Feet). Relative humidity and temperature of the chamber were measured daily and ranged from 33-58% and 21.0-22.8\u00b0C, respectively. We adjusted airflow in the chamber using a scaling factor. This factor was defined as the ratio of the volume of a hospital room to our chamber, e.g., 8 .41 to create ventilation at both 6 ACH (171 CFM) and 12 ACH (343 CFM). This adjustment was necessary because our ventilatory parameters (e.g., tidal and cough volume) were for normal individuals but the test chamber volume was smaller than a standard room. [19, 20] As the volume of the test chamber decreases relative to tidal volume, the contribution of tidal volume per breath increases proportionately, thus increasing particulate concentration per breath relative to a decreased room volume. To correct for this air exchange flow must be proportionately increased. [16] Within the chamber two Resusci Anne CPR manikins (No. 310200; Laerdal Medical) were placed just beyond 3 ft apart, immediately outside the area defined by the CDC as close contact (<3 ft). Within this distance HCW's are at higher risk for of infection via aerosols during aerosol generating activities such as coughing. [3] This mimicked two individuals in a room. Each manikin was connected to a Harvard ventilation pump (Harvard Apparatus SN No. A52587; Millis, MA). Resusci Anne CPR manikin heads are realistically sized (based on a mold of a real female face) with soft deformable \"skin-textured\" faces. A detailed study, testing mask fit, on this manikin has been recently published. [21] Aerosols were released from the Source during tidal breathing or coughing. An identical ventilated manikin, the Receiver, contained a filter designed to capture all inhaled particles quantifying health care worker exposure.",

The only mask to provide significantly different results on the Receiver was the N95 with a Vaseline seal. Differences between mask types were significant indicating that the major mechanism of protection was filtration. Similar findings were seen in the Hospital room, that is, with better filtration, exposure was reduced with an N95 with and without a Vaseline seal on Source or Receiver. Review of RPF data for the Hospital room indicates that, in general, exposure was lower (higher RPF) when the respirator was on the Source. However, this was not statistically significant. In the Negative pressure room applying either surgical mask or respirator to the Source resulted in statistically significant reductions in exposure, while on the Receiver only the N95 with or without a Vaseline seal afforded similar protection. While there were significant differences between some masks (e.g., capture efficiency effect, SMnat vs. N95 vs. N95vas), in the Negative pressure room, the major differences in exposure were due to outward leakage of particles around the faceseal perimeter (deflection) at the Source. In this environment, deflected particles are rapidly carried away by the airstream. This observation is most evident by comparing RPF between the Source and Receiver. Each mask on the Source markedly reduced receiver exposure even if the mask had a poor capture efficiency. Here, deflection was the important mechanism in reducing receiver exposure.",

Nor does it address the many variables associated with such protection, such as infectious dose and transmission modes, all of which may vary significantly with each infectious threat. Rather, we utilize in vitro respiratory protection measurements such as RPF as a means to correlate exposure reduction with source control to that achieved through the use of different masks or respirators on the Receiver. Our findings support the use of facemasks as a potentially reliable and consistent means of infection control, akin to other environmental controls such as respiratory etiquette, hand washing, physical partitions and engineering controls such as negative pressure isolation rooms.

            "text": "Our data may help in designing better masks. In the Hospital room, when there was an increased outward leakage at the Source (e.g., less aerosol captured by the mask) there was reduced protection (reduced RPF) at the Receiver. Reducing facepiece resistance would reduce outward leakage and may compensate for flaws with the fit of a mask. [24] During coughing, source control was clearly superior to masking the Receiver. In the Negative pressure chamber, placing a natural fit surgical mask (S-SMnat) on the Source during coughing reduced exposure approximately 1,500-fold (RPF = 1587), compared to the extreme of sealing an N95 respirator (R-N95-vas) to the face of the receiver (RPF = 17). This observation was due to the combined effects of the impaction of expelled particles on the mask ( Figure 6 ) and extraction of deflected particles by the flow of air in the room. These findings were consistent with the results reported by Cheong and Phua [18] who found that, in a negative pressure room, placing the exhaust vent on the wall behind the patient's bed, as in our experiments, was more effective in removing pollutants than having the exhaust vent in the ceiling above the patient. [18] Our study has several limitations. Directions of airflow and head position were fixed and changes in direction may affect our observations. In addition, in an actual hospital setting, the airflow and ventilation may vary based on room design, location of vents and position of the patient and HCW. Our head positions and airflow were in an optimized direction for HCW protection, from Receiver to Source. This may enhance the reported effect of Source control. However, the parameters we have chosen for ventilation and airflow magnitude and direction are typical for those reported for hospital rooms in previous studies. [25] In addition, Lindsley et al. found that exposure to potentially infectious aerosols anywhere in the room was unaffected by head position. [25] Our aerosols are aqueous and particle distributions will be affected by changes in ambient relative humidity. While relative humidity of the ambient air varied, wet nebulizers provide saturated air so the aerosols leaving the Source manikin always are insensitive to room air humidity.",

            "text": "Our study does not use formal fit-testing methods to arrive at protective RPF values, but we utilize set of measurements to arrive at an equivalent fit factor (e.g., a reduction in exposure due to use of a mask). Fit testing of manikins is complex as reported in our previous study, which focused on the effects of testing different types of manikins on our measurement of fit. [21] As we reported in that study, improved fit was readily quantified by our techniques allowing a separation of effects caused by changes in Source control and/or changes in fit at the Receiver. Many manikin studies simply seal the facepiece to the manikin to avoid this issue. We feel that our sealed and unsealed results provide an increased understanding of the interaction between factors involved with actual exposures beyond that of only Receiver protection alone.",
