Influenza in pregnant women has historically been associated with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality. Pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and it is the number one cause of death from an infectious disease. Although pregnant women do not get pneumonia more often than nonpregnant women, it can result in greater morbidity and mortality because of the physiologic adaptations of pregnancy. Pregnant patients who have either of these conditions require a higher level of surveillance and intervention.",

First identified in 1933, they remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality from febrile respiratory illness worldwide [1] . Influenza A is subtyped using two surface antigens: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Both viruses are further grouped based on antigenic characteristics. Antigenic drift, the yearly variation in the surface antigens caused by point mutations, results in the need for annual revaccination. Because immunity to surface antigens reduces the chance of becoming infected as well as the severity of symptoms if infected [2] , vaccines are developed with subtle alterations each year in anticipation of viral variation. Antigenic shift, seen only in influenza A, occurs when mutations accumulate in the N or H antigens, replacing 0095 the current antigen with a new subtype. The years associated with antigenic shift report much higher morbidity and mortality rates. Between 1990 and 1999, influenza caused an average of 36,000 deaths per year [3] . The H3N2 strain of influenza A has caused the most hospitalizations during epidemic years since 1968, at approximately 142,000 per year [4] . A patient's response to influenza is multifactorial and cannot be predicted based on viral properties alone [5] . It is this uncertainty that has continued to make influenza a formidable opponent.",

Pneumonia complicated 585 (43%) of the cases. In 52% of these patients, the pregnancy was interrupted. There were 308 (23%) maternal deaths. Mortality was highest in the last 3 months of pregnancy, and increased if complicated by pneumonia [6] . During the influenza epidemic of 1957, 22 pregnant women in New York City died from complications of the flu. Pregnant women accounted for nearly half the deaths of women of childbearing age [7] . During the same epidemic, 11 pregnant women died in Minnesota. All deaths were attributed to respiratory insufficiency secondary to pulmonary edema and pneumonia [8] . Mullooly and colleagues [9] reviewed influenza complicating pregnancy from 1975 to 1979. There were four epidemics in that 5-year time period. Pregnant women sought outpatient medical attention for acute respiratory disease during the influenza season significantly more often than nonpregnant women; however, unlike the previously reported epidemics, there were no maternal deaths attributable to influenza, and the hospitalization rate was low at 2 per 1000.",

Nasal samples provide a higher level of sensitivity than do throat samples when performing rapid testing. The positive and negative predictive value of the rapid tests depends on the level of influenza activity in the population being tested. Patients who have a clinical picture highly suggestive of influenza but with a negative rapid test should still be cultured, because false negatives do occur [4, 12] .

Local consolidation is seen on chest radiograph with superimposed bacterial pneumonia. Myopathy is another complication that has been associated with influenza. Patients may develop rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. In adults, myopathy is more commonly found with influenza A. It has been suggested that a genetic predisposition exists for this complication. Pathology slides of muscle biopsies taken from patients who had suspected influenza-associated myopathy showed lysis of muscle fibers. Carditis has also been reported. The influenza virus has been isolated from the myocardium of patients who died of influenza complications. With carditis there are often EKG changes, including ST changes, inverted T waves, and rate disturbances. Carditis can occur at the same time as the initial respiratory manifestations. Finally, encephalopathy is a rare complication of influenza. The virus has been isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue at autopsy. Encephalopathy is also thought to be genetically linked [5] .",

The adamantanes, M2 ion-channel inhibitors, include amantadine and rimantadine. These drugs have activity only against influenza A [24] . Given as chemoprophylaxis, they are 70% to 90% effective at preventing influenza. They also can be given within the first 48 hours of symptoms to reduce symptom duration. To minimize drug resistance, therapy should be discontinued within 24 to 48 hours after symptoms resolve, or 3 to 5 days. Most notable side effects are of the central nervous system and include confusion, insomnia, and difficulty concentrating [25] . The neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in the treatment of influenza A and B. Oseltamivir, given orally, is approved for both treatment and chemoprophylaxis. It is reported to be 70% to 90% effective at preventing influenza [26] . The most commonly reported side effects are nausea and vomiting [27] . Zanamivir is an inhaled medication approved for treatment only. It should be noted that there have been several reports of bronchospasm in patients who have asthma and who take this drug. Both shorten the duration of symptoms by, on average, 1 day. There are limited data on safety in pregnancy. All four drugs are US Food and Drug Administration category C, and therefore should be used only when the benefits outweigh the risks [28] .",

Vaccination is most effective when performed in October or November, although unvaccinated patients should not be denied vaccination later in the season. The recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is that all women who will be pregnant during the influenza season should receive the vaccine. Vaccination can be performed safely in any trimester of pregnancy [29, 30] . Breast feeding is not a contraindication to vaccination [4] . There are two different vaccines available. One is a live-attenuated vaccine (LAIV), whereas the other is inactivated. The inactivated vaccine is used for pregnant women as well as all other high risk groups. The LAIV is recommended only for healthy persons ages 5 to 49. The inactivated vaccine is less expensive. Both vaccines are contraindicated in people who have an anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs or other components of the vaccine, people who have an acute febrile illness, and people who have a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination. Peak antibody protection develops 2 weeks after vaccination [31, 32] . Inactivated vaccine in the United States that is distributed in single-dose syringes is preservative-free and contains only trace amounts of thimerosal, a mercury-containing compound. Thus, there is little concern for mercury exposure because it is limited to less than 0.5 mcg mercury/0.25-mL dose [33] . Vaccine efficacy in healthy adults less than 65 years of age is 70% to 90% if circulating and vaccine viruses are antigenically similar [4] .",

Over 5 million cases occur annually, with more than 1 million persons requiring hospitalization [34, 35] . Although associated with far less mortality, women of reproductive age are susceptible to pneumonia from a bacterial, viral, or fungal source. Although pregnant women do not get pneumonia more often than nonpregnant women, it can result in greater morbidity and mortality because of the physiologic adaptations of pregnancy. These include a decrease in pulmonary functional residual capacity as well as alterations in cell-mediated immunity. Thus, pregnant patients require a higher level of surveillance and intervention. In a study by Jin and colleagues [36] the hospitalization rate for community-acquired pneumonia in pregnant women was 1.51 per 1000 pregnancies.

Ahmad and coworkers [48] reported 22 cases of PCP in pregnancy. The mortality rate was extremely high at 50%. Fifty-nine percent required mechanical ventilation. These numbers may be inflated because none of the patients were on antiretroviral therapy, because all were diagnosed with HIV when diagnosed with PCP. Treatment is with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or pentamidine. HIV-infected patients who have a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count less than 200/mL, a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis, or an AIDS-defining illness should receive prophylaxis [49] . The preferred regimen is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, one double-strength tablet per day. Prophylaxis is 90% to 95% effective [50] .",

Erythema nodosum has been reported to be a marker of good outcome in pregnant women [73] . Dissemination of disease in pregnancy is a controversial topic. Historically, dissemination was reported to be 40 to 100 times more frequent in pregnancy [74] . Caldwell and colleagues [72] found the incidence of dissemination in pregnancy to be 9%, three times the rate of the nonpregnant population. In their series, 23/32 recovered without treatment, and there were no deaths. Risk factors include living in an endemic area, smoking, older age, diabetes, and low socioeconomic status [71] . Treatment is with amphotericin B.",

Given that the majority of pregnant women are young and healthy, intense, early treatment is likely to result in a good outcome.",
