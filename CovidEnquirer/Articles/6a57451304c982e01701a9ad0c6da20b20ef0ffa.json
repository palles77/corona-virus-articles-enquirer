The aim of this study was to investigate the yield of our pre-HCT pulmonary screening program. We also describe our management guidelines based on these findings and correlate them with symptomatic lung injury after HCT. Since 2008, all patients undergo a dedicated pulmonary screening consisting of pulmonary function test (PFT), chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) before HCT. We systematically evaluated the yield during the first 5 years of our screening program. We included 142 consecutive children. In 74% of patients, abnormalities were found. In 66% of patients, 1 or more PFT results were <80% of normal. Chest HRCT showed abnormalities in 55%; 19% of these abnormalities were considered \"clinically significant.\" BAL was abnormal in 43% of patients; respiratory viruses (PCR) were found in 35 patients, fungi (antigen or culture) in 21, and bacteria (culture) in 22. All 3 screening tests contributed separately to clinically relevant information regarding pulmonary status in these pre-HCT children. In 46 patients (33%), screening results had diagnostic and/or therapeutic implications. We found an association between pre-SCT HRCT findings and lung injury after transplantation. Pre-HCT screening with the combination of 3 modalities, reflecting different domains of respiratory status (function, structure, and microbial colonization), reveals important abnormalities in a substantial number of patients. Whether this improves patient outcome requires further investigation.",
