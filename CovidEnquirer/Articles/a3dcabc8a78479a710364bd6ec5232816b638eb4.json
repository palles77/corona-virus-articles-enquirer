An understanding of the antibody responses to the viral components is very important for diagnosis and vaccine development. Objective: The spectrum of SARS-specific antibody profiles in SARS patients was investigated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms. Study design: Serial serum samples from 14 SARS patients were isolated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms, and were tested for anti-viral IgG and IgM by indirect immunofluorescence tests (IFA), anti-nucleocaspid antibody by ELISA tests and viral neutralization. Results: Anti-viral (IgG) and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were observed in 13 of 14 patients at 14 days after the onset of symptoms, and in all 14 patients at 30-210 days thereafter. Anti-viral antibody (IgM) was detected maximally at 30 days, later than that for the IgG class. IgM antibody declined and became undetectable between 60 to 180 days after the onset of the symptoms. Neutralizing viral antibodies were demonstrated in the sera from all of the patients with SARS symptoms. Conclusions: Anti-viral IgG, IgM, and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were detected 7-30 days in patients after the onset of SARS symptoms. Anti-viral IgM antibodies disappeared earlier than IgG. Viral neutralization was demonstrated in the sera from the convalescent patients.",

Serial serum samples were collected at 7-210 days after the onset of symptoms, and were subjected to antibody analysis. Anti-viral antibodies (IgG, IgM) were assayed by indirect fluorescence (IF) kits developed by Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology and approved by State Drugs Administration of China (Si et al., 2003) . 20 l diluted sera (1:20 or greater dilution) were added onto slides containing monolayers of SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells and non-infected Vero cells as a negative control. The slides were incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 30 min, washed three times with PBS (phosphate buffered saline), and then FITC-labeled anti-human IgG or FITC-labeled anti-human IgM were added for 30 min. The slides were washed as before, and fluorescence was detected with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope. The dilution for cut off is 1:20. Anti-nucleocaspid (N protein, NP) total Ig was assayed by an antigen-capturing ELISA (AC-ELISA) co-developed by Sina-American Biotechnology Co. Ltd. and Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Shi et al., 2003) . For this assay, 100 l of serum samples were added to wells coated with recombinant N protein, the plate was incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 30 min, and then washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. 100 l HRP (Horse radish peroxidase)-conjugated N protein was added and the plate was incubated for another 30 min followed by washing as above. Then 100 l of TMB substrate solution (0.1 mg/ml tetramethylbenzidine hydrochloride, 0.01% H 2 O 2 in 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 5.8) was added and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 20 min, The reaction was terminated by adding 50 l 2 N sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined. The maximum dilution of the serum at which a positive signal was obtained (IFA), or an absorbance at 450 nm wavelength greater than 0.15 (cutoff value) was given, was defined as antibody titer. The data were analyzed by SPSS11.0 software and the geometric means of seropositive samples were employed in all statistics.",
