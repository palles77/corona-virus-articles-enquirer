            "text": "Background: Early and accurate detection of respiratory viruses (RV) is important for patient management. We have previously shown that self-collected nasal swabs (NS) are feasible and as sensitive as clinician-collected nasal washes for detection of RV, but the additive benefit of self-collected throat swabs is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the added yield of self-collected nasal to throat swabs for detection of RV by PCR in patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. Study design: Patients with URTI symptoms self-collected paired polyurethane foam NS and nylon flocked throat swabs and completed a symptom survey. Swabs were tested for 12 RV by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Descriptive, McNemar's, and Wilcoxon signed rank statistical tests were used. Results: 115 paired nasal and throat swabs were collected from 63 individuals, with 71/115 (62%) positive for a RV by at least one specimen, including 51 positive by both, 17 positive by NS only, and 3 positive by throat swab only. The sensitivity of NS was 96% (95%CI: 88-99) versus 76% (95% CI: 65-85) in throat swabs, p < 0.001. The median PCR cycle threshold (Ct) in 51 concordant samples was lower (indicating higher viral concentration) in NS (25.1) versus throat swabs (32.0). The three samples positive only by throat swab had high Ct values (33.8, 36.2, and 38.8, all rhinovirus). Conclusion: Self-collection of NS was significantly more sensitive than self collection of throat swabs for detection of RV by RT-PCR. The addition of throat sampling does not appear to increase the diagnostic load in the self-testing setting.",

Diagnosis of RVI is often limited by the need to get a clinician-collected respiratory sample. However, it may be difficult for ill patients to go to a healthcare facility, and if they do, time to diagnosis may be delayed [1] and they may expose other patients or staff to infection. Identification of sensitive methods for self-collection would address these issues, as well as provide options for community-based assessments of RVI epidemiology and longitudinal monitoring.",

Our prior study comparing self-collected oral gargles to NS in lung transplant recipients with symptomatic RVI demonstrated lower sensitivity of oral gargles [9] .

Seventeen pairs were only positive by NS versus three only positive by throat swabs. In the latter case, the viruses detected were all HRV and had high Ct values (33.8, 36.2, and 38.8) and all had both nasal and throat symptoms. The median Ct values varied based on whether the specimens were concordant: The median Ct for NS was lower (higher viral concentration) within concordant pairs compared to when NS was the only sample positive, and findings were similar for throat swabs (Fig. 1) ",

            "text": "In this prospective study of 115 paired self-collected polyurethane foam nasal and nylon flocked throat specimens in patients with respiratory symptoms, we found that throat swabs did not substantially add to the detection of RV by RT-PCR. We also determined that the Ct values in NS were significantly lower, indicating higher viral concentrations. Specific symptoms (nasal congestion, sore throat, etc.) were not associated with increased likelihood of detection by one method versus the other, although nasal symptoms and sneezing were more common in those with RV detected versus not. There were limitations to this study. There were only small numbers of episodes for several specific viruses, making it difficult to generalize results to all viruses. In a study of H5N1, De Jong, et al reported that provider-collected pharyngeal specimens were positive more frequently, and had higher viral loads, than nasal swabs [16] . We only had 7, non-typed, influenza cases, and so could not assess this finding. Second, while prior data shows our self-collected NS are equivalent to provider-collected samples, we have not evaluated this for throat swabs. However, this study focuses on the real-world application of self-collected samples, and our findings provide insight regarding viral load and detection in two separate respiratory sites. Third, we used different swabs for nasal (polyurethane foam) and throat (nylon flocked). The nasal swabs were chosen based on increased comfort and patient acceptability and our prior studies demonstrating comparability to provider-collected nasal washes [8] , and flocked throat swabs were the standard at the time; however, different swab types may yield different results. Overall, we found that collection of throat swabs in addition to NS provided minimal added RVI detection. Our findings, along with the added burden of collecting a second sample and the additional costs associated with testing, support the use of self-collected NS only for outpatient and community-based RV testing.",
