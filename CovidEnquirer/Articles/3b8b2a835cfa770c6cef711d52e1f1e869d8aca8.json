            "text": "Objective: Tumor-treating fields are currently used to successfully treat various cancers; however, the specific pathways associated with its efficacy remain unknown in the immune responses. Here, we evaluated tumor-treating fields-mediated initiation of the macrophage-specific immune response. Materials and Methods: We subjected RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages to clinically relevant levels of tumor-treating fields (0.9 V/cm, 150 kHz) and evaluated alterations in cytokine expression and release, as well as cell viability. Additionally, we investigated the status of immunomodulatory pathways to determine their roles in tumor-treating fields-mediated immune activation. Results and Discussion: Our results indicated that tumor-treating fields treatment at 0.9 V/cm decreased cell viability and increased cytokine messenger RNA/protein levels, as well as levels of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, relative to controls. The levels of tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin 1b, and interleukin 6 were markedly increased in tumor-treating fields-treated RAW 264.7 cells cocultured with 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells compared with those in 4T1 or RAW 264.7 cells with or without tumor-treating fields treatment. Moreover, the viability of 4T1 cells treated with the conditioned medium of tumor-treating fields-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells decreased, indicating that macrophage activation by tumor-treating fields effectively killed the tumor cells. Moreover, tumor-treating fields treatment activated the nuclear factor kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways involved in immunomodulatory signaling. Conclusion: These results provide critical insights into the mechanisms through which tumor-treating fields affect macrophagespecific immune responses and the efficacy of this method for cancer treatment.",

            "text": "Tumor-treating fields (TTFs) therapy, in which small electric fields are pulsed through the skin to disturb mitosis, represents a noninvasive, regional treatment modality that was recently approved for the therapy of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) by the US Food and Drug Administration and gained a CE mark in Europe. [1] [2] [3] The clinical concept is that TTFs therapy delivers low-intensity (0.9-3 V/cm), intermediate-frequency (100-300 kHz), and alternating electric fields to the tumor using transducer arrays placed on the skin around the tumor site. 4 The proposed mechanisms of action involve disruption of the metaphase of tumor cells by interfering with mitotic spindle formation and disruption of anaphase by the dielectrophoretic dislocation of intracellular constituents, resulting in an overall effect of apoptosis. 3 The antimitotic effect of TTFs treatment has been showed in various cell lines as well as in GBM by tuning the appropriate frequency to specific cancer cell types. [5] [6] [7] A phase III trial of TTFs combined with temozolomide established that this treatment protocol led to minimal toxicity, increased the overall survival rate, and improved patient quality of life with equivalent therapeutic efficacy to chemotherapy. Moreover, in addition to its combination with chemotherapy, synergistic enhancement of the cellular response was reported when TTFs were administered in combination with radiation therapy. Thus, with these merits, ongoing and future trials will evaluate TTFs to treat various cancer types, including newly diagnosed GBM, solid tumor brain metastases, nonsmall cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer.",

            "text": "Emerging evidence has demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment may greatly contribute to the final outcome of cancer treatment modalities. Several types of cells including leukocytes, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells form the tumor microenvironment, which has immune cells as its major component. 8 These immune cells interact with tumor cells to influence the initiation, proliferation, elimination, invasion, and metastasis of tumors. 9 In particular, tumor-associated macrophages are immune cells that orchestrate various factors in the tumor microenvironment through the polarization of M1 or M2 macrophages. 8, 10, 11 Tumor-associated macrophages play a crucial role in the link between inflammation and cancer to produce inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) 1b, interferon g, IL-12, and IL-23, along with anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13). [12] [13] [14] [15] Despite increasing studies of the effect of TTFs on cancers, the influence of TTFs on immune cells has not yet been determined. Therefore, to further understand the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of TTFs therapy and further improve this treatment modality, we investigated the influence of TTFs exposure on the function of murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells, a frequently used in vitro model to investigate the immune response and inflammation.",

The production of NO in TTFs-treated RAW 264.7 cells was slightly increased, whereas LPS stimulation significantly enhanced NO production ( Figure  2B ).

The mRNA levels of IL-1b and TNF-a were significantly upregulated by the administration of TTFs, and further increase was observed in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. We further investigated the release of some key proinflammatory cytokines in the coculture medium. Compared with that in other groups, IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6 levels in the coculture of TTFs-treated RAW 264.7 cells with 4T1 cells were significantly increased at 48 hours in a manner dependent on the ratio of the 2 cells ( Figure 3B ). To evaluate the cytotoxic activity of the CM of TTFs-treated RAW 264.7 cells against 4T1 cells, an MTT assay was performed. As shown in Figure 3C , 4T1 cells exposed to the CM of unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells did not show statistically significant decrease in viability, whereas 4T1 cells exposed to CM from TTFs-treated RAW 264.7 cells exhibited decreased viability after 24 or 48 hours contact with the CM.

The phosphorylation levels of p38 MAPK were significantly increased in TTFsadministered RAW 264.7 cells at 24 hours after treatment.

The underlying mechanical mechanisms include the disruption of mitosis and selective killing of rapidly proliferating cells by delivering continuous (>18 h/d) low-intensity, intermediate-frequency, alternating electric fields to the tumor site. Tumor-treating fields ultimately lead to caspase-dependent or caspase-independent-induced apoptosis. [18] [19] [20] Tumor-treating fields have been shown to apply its antimitotic effects in preclinical systems of various cancers, including GBM through the similar molecular mechanisms of activity. 5, 6, 21, 22 Furthermore, TTFs have been tried in preclinical systems combined with cytotoxic, chemotherapeutic agents in order to enhance the general antitumor effects. Combined treatment of TTFs with these chemotherapeutic agents (microtubule inhibitors, nucleoside analogues, folate antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and immune checkpoint inhibitors) demonstrated an additive cytotoxic effect. Taxanes and TTFs showed a synergistic effect against cancer cells. 23 In addition, in in vitro preclinical models, TTFs were shown to expose calreticulin to the cell surface, which ultimately significantly decreased the tumor volume in vitro and to considerably decrease the tumor volume in combination with antiprogrammed T-cell death 1 to significantly increase antigenpresenting cell infiltration of the tumor. 24 These events show the potentiation of immunogenic cell death by the treatment of TTFs, 25 which needs further investigation. Although a large number of studies using TTFs as an anticancer therapy are ongoing, the influence of TTFs on normal tissues in the tumor microenvironment remains largely unknown. Thus, in the current study, we demonstrated that TTFs exert potential immunostimulatory activity via regulation of NF-kB/MAPK signaling pathways in RAW 264.7 macrophages.",

Furthermore, TTFs significantly enhanced the production of NO in RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. After its release from macrophages, NO acts as an intracellular messenger to mediate the nonspecific immune response 27 and has also been suggested to be a critical factor in the immune response. 28 Nitric oxide is a gaseous, free radical and acts as a signaling molecule in biological systems, recruiting leukocytes to affected tissues. 29, 30 Inducible NOS is the inducible enzyme for NO production and is responsible for increased levels of NO. Accumulating evidence indicates that intracellular ROS also serves as a second messenger in inflammatory signal transduction by modulating the release of other inflammatory mediators and stimulating MAPK activity. [31] [32] [33] In our result, we observed that the stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells by TTFs increases iNOS expression as well as the production of NO and ROS, although the increase was much lower than that observed in LPS-treated cells. Therefore, TTFs may have immune mediating/modulating effects, including activation of macrophages and mediating their biological functions such as tumoricidal activity through NO-dependent pathways. 34 Once activated, macrophages release abundant cytokines that act as signals to control homeostasis via regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and immune responses. 35 Figure 3 .

The levels of TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6 were markedly higher in TTFs-treated RAW 264.7 cells cocultured with 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma cells than in 4T1 or RAW 264.7 cells with or without TTFs. Moreover, the viability of 4T1 cells treated with the CM of TTFs-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells decreased, indicating that macrophage activation by TTFs effectively killed the tumor cells.",

            "text": "As essential pathways of inflammation, we therefore evaluated the effect of TTFs on NF-kB and MAPKs activation in RAW 264.7 cells. Nuclear factor-kB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that plays a crucial role in inflammatory processes via the induction of a wide variety of genes, including inflammatory cytokines, mediators, and chemokines. 37 The phosphorylation-induced degradation of IkBs activates and dissociates from NF-kB. As demonstrated in the present result, TTFs significantly increased the phosphorylation of IkB-a in RAW 264.7 cells, thereby inducing nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of NF-kB in macrophages. Moreover, MAPKs regulate various inflammatory mediators, including TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, cyclooxygenase 2, and iNOS, [38] [39] [40] suggesting that the inflammatory activity of TTFs is associated with its effect on the MAPK signaling pathway, a key upstream signaling pathway in the regulation of inflammatory mediators. 41 Mitogen-activated protein kinases, including ERK, p38, and JNK, participate in the activation of NF-kB to regulate the gene expression and protein synthesis of inflammatory mediators. 41 Interleukin 1b, a major proinflammatory cytokine, can easily activate MAPK pathways. 42, 43 Thus, we investigated whether the inflammatory effects of TTFs involved the MAPK regulation. Indeed, p38 MAPK signaling pathways were obviously activated in TTFs-treated macrophages. Therefore, our results indicate that TTFs may increase inflammatory responses by inducing p38 MAPK pathways in macrophages.",
