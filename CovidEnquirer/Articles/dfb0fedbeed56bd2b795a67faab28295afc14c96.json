Despite the rapid spread worldwide, the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease (ARD) remain largely unclear. In two recent studies documenting the clinical manifestations of 41 and 99 patients respectively with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD who were admitted to Wuhan, the severity of some cases with 2019-nCoV ARD mimicked that of SARS-CoV [1, 12] . Given the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV, an updated analysis with significantly larger sample sizes by incorporating cases throughout China is urgently warranted. This will not only identify the defining epidemiological and clinical characteristics with greater precision, but also unravel the risk factors associated with mortality. Here, by collecting the data from 1,099 laboratory-confirmed cases, we sought to provide an up-to-date delineation of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with 2019-nCoV ARD throughout mainland China.",

First, some cases had incomplete documentation of the exposure history, symptoms and laboratory testing given the variation in the structure of electronic database among different participating site and the urgent timeline for data extraction. Some cases were diagnosed in out-patient settings where medical information was briefly documented and incomplete laboratory testing was applied. There was a shortage of infrastructure and training of medical staff in non-specialty hospitals, which has been aggravated by the burn-out of local medical staff in milieu of a surge of cases. Second, because many patients still remained in the hospital, we did not compare the 28-day rate of the composite endpoint. To mitigate the potential bias, we have applied the competing-risk model for analysis. Third, we might have missed asymptomatic or mild cases managed at home, and hence our cohort might represent the more severe end of 2019-nCoV ARD. However, there were a minority of patients who had no apparent radiologic manifestations, suggesting that we had included patients at the early stage of disease. Last, we took reference on the existing international guideline to define the severity of 2019-nCoV because of its global recognition [15] .",

Importantly, the routes of transmission might have contributed considerably to the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV. Conventional routes of transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and highly pathogenic influenza consisted of the respiratory droplets and direct contact [17-19]. According to our latest pilot experiment, 4 out of 62 stool specimens (6.5%) tested positive to 2019-nCoV, and another four patients in a separate cohort who tested positive to rectal swabs had the 2019-nCoV being detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva or urine (see Tables E3-E4 in Supplementary Appendix). In a case with severe peptic ulcer after symptom onset, 2019-nCoV was directly detected in the esophageal erosion and bleeding site (Hong Shan and Jin-cun Zhao, personal communication). Collectively, fomite transmission might have played a role in the rapid transmission of 2019-nCoV, and hence hygiene protection should take into account the transmission via gastrointestinal secretions.These findings will, by integrating systemic protection measures, curb the rapid spread worldwide.",
