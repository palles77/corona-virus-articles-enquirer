There is an urgent need to establish an effective and unbiased method to evaluate and monitor such contamination. This study aims to investigate the utility of next generation sequencing (NGS) method to detect possible contamination in the microbiology laboratory. Environmental samples were taken at multiple sites at the lab including the inner site of centrifuge rotor, the bench used for molecular biological tests, the benches of biosafety cabinets used for viral culture, clinical sample pre-treatment and nucleic acids extraction, by scrubbing the sites using sterile flocked swabs. The extracted total nucleic acids were used to construct the libraries for deep sequencing according to the protocol of Ion Torrent platform. At least 1G raw data was obtained for each sample. The reads of viruses and bacteria accounted for 0.01 \u00b1 0.02%, and 77.76 \u00b1 12.53% of total reads respectively. The viral sequences were likely to be derived from gene amplification products, the nucleic acids contaminated in fetal bovine serum. Reads from environmental microorganisms were also identified. Our results suggested that NGS method was capable of monitoring the nucleic acids contaminations from different sources in the lab, demonstrating its promising utility in monitoring and assessing the risk of potential laboratory contamination. The risk of contamination from reagents, remnant DNA and environment should be considered in data analysis and results interpretation.",

The gene fragments from exogenous microorganisms have a great impact on the deep sequencing results, especially for the clinical samples with low microbial biomass.

Firstly, all the viral reads obtained from the environment samples were compared to the positive control. It showed the HCoV-229E reads dominant in the positive control was only detected in H1 and H4 samples with less than 10 reads. The two sampling sites were biosafety cabinet bench in Room 1 and 2, used for virus culture and clinical samples treating, indicating an occasional contamination from samples or nucleic acids. No other samples showed positive on HCoV 229E, which helped to ensure us the quality control of NGS procedure in this study. There are viral reads in the negative control (H0) mapping to CeHV-5, IFVA and flock house virus, which similar to the distribution in H7, the PCR hood used for adding nucleic acids templates, indicating a residual nucleic acids contamination. Viral reads related to the experiments performed in recent one month were also identified in these environment samples. In a summary, we considered these viral sequences were mainly from three parts. (1) Experimental activities. The obtained short viral reads are mainly mapped to the terminal gene region or the PCR primers targeting regions (see Figure 3 ). No complete viral genome was identified even in samples collected from viral isolation and culture sites. Moreover, the reads of human mastadenovirus, polyomavirus, enterovirus, and human betaherpesvirus 5, were found only in samples collected from bench, centrifuge rotor (H8, H9) in BSL-I and PCR hood (H7), correlated to the experiments performed in these sites. Of note, since RNA were preferentially amplified in our protocol, DNA contamination (e.g., PCR products) level should be underestimated, thus we are presenting a lower boundary of DNA contamination. The results indicated these viral reads were mainly from the gene amplification products or residual degraded nucleic acids. As the viral reads related to the viruses used in recent one month could be detected, the residual DNA fragments could help to trace experimental activities within a month. (2) Experimental materials. For example, the fetal bovine serum was confirmed to be contaminated by the bovine viral diarrhea virus [18] [19] [20] [21] . Besides that, the reverse transcriptase which derived from murine leukemia virus [27] [28] [29] , and the recombinant protein expression system which involves the use of viral vectors are potential sources of contamination [30] [31] [32] . (3) Environment. Reads of the tobacco mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus were found in most of the samples except negative control and the samples collected from biosafety cabinets in BSL-II (H1 and H4). As reported, the two kinds of viruses are widely distributed in water and soil [33, 34] . The hepatitis C virus and rotavirus, not used in the lab, were found in samples from the centrifuge rotor (H6) and the bench in BSL-I with less than ten reads. Whether these viral reads were from environment or not need to be investigated further.",

All types of bacteria seem to be derived from the external environment [24] . Room 4 has the most abundant microbial species, as frequent molecular biological experiments and immunology related experiments occurred in this room. A large number of microbial sequences in all centrifuge rotors were found, which emphasized the necessity of routine clean and disinfection for this equipment. The gene fragments from exogenous microorganisms have a great impact on the deep sequencing results, especially for the clinical samples with low microbial biomass, such as cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [25, [35] [36] [37] [38] . Application of the NGS technique on biosafety monitoring would enable us to disentangle the background noise presenting in the sequencing data, which in turn help to distinguish true microorganisms from false positives. Meanwhile, laboratory contamination should be suspected when obtaining the complete genome sequence of cultured viruses, or abnormally enrichment of specific microbes.",
