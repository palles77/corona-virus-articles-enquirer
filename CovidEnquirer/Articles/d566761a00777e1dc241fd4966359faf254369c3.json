The pathogenesis of porcine rotavirus in gnotobiotic piglets was studied by light microscopy (LM) , fl uorescent antibody technique (FA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and it was demonstrated that clinical signs were correlated with viral replication and with induced virus lesions in the small intestine (McAdaragh, Bergeland, Meyer, Johnshoy, Stotz, Benfield and Hammer, 1980; Narita, Fukusho, Konno and Shimizu, 1982; Pearson and McNulty, 1979; Theil, Bohl, Cross, Kohler and Agnes, 1978; Torres-Medina and Underdahl, 1980) .

These degenerated cells contained few viral particles (Fig. 6) . In some sections, the infected cells appeared to be detaching from adjacent epithelial cells and being shed into the lumen (Fig. 7) . Man) viral particles were seen within the distended RER. They were classified as 3 types; enveloped, non-enveloped particles and nucleoids. Enveloped particles were 70 to 80 nm in size and some appeared to have acquired an outer shell by, budding through the endoplasmic reticulum. Non-enveloped particles were 50 to 65 nm in size. Both types of viral particles had an electron-dense core measuring 20 to 30 nm. In the cytoplasm of the infected cells, non-membrane bound, granular matrices containing an electron-dense virus core were present (Fig. 8) . In the ileum, most of the epithelial cells were desquamated from the villi and a small number of neutrophils was observed in the submucosa. At 48 h after infection, disruption and desquamation of the cells were still present in a few areas of villi. At this time the short villi were covered with a type of cell which was ultrastructurally different from any of those seen on tht villi in the earlier stages. They were flat to cuboida1, contained oval nuclei lying parallel to the axis of the villi and were closely applied to the basement membrane.",

Subsequently, most of the absorptive cells appeared to be lost due to either cell desquamation or disruption. Therefore, the interaction of virus and intestinal cells, and the resulting absorptive cell degeneration, indicates that rotavirus is pathogenic for the epithelial cells of the small intestine. These TEM changes correlated well with those previously found by LM, SEM and FA examination by Lecce, King and Mock (1976), McAdaragh et al. (1980) , McNulty (1977), Theil et al. (1978) and Torres-Medina and Underdahl (1980) . Concerning the entry of the virus into cells, Pensaert, Haelterman and Hinsman (1970) and Wagner, Beamer and Ristic (1973) reported that transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virions are taken up by pinocytosis and then transported into the epithelial cytoplasm. Electron micrographs of cells taken 12 h after inoculation with rotavirus revealed viral particles between microvilli and in the apical tips, and vesicles in the terminal web areas of some otherwise apparently normal epithelial cells. These findings resemble those with TGE virus infection and therefore they strongly suggest that porrinc rotavirus is also taken up by pinocytosis. The present EM observations have provided additional information on the mode of virus release from host cells into the lumen. There seem to be 2 processes involved;",
