In such an event, adequate supplies of aff ordable vaccines and antiviral agents will be unavailable to most people in the world. In view of the overwhelming need for eff ective alternatives, generic agents that target the host immune response or the pandemic virus should be considered. Many scientists doubt the eff ectiveness of these agents. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that statins improve outcomes in patients with bacteraemia and pneumonia and might be similarly eff ective against infl uenza. An experimental study has shown that the fi brate gemfi brozil, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1 agonist, reduces mortality in H2N2 infl uenza virus-infected mice. There is substantial molecular cross-talk between statins and PPAR agonists, and their clinical eff ects are additive in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Chloroquine increases endosomal pH, impairing infl uenza virus release into the cytosol. Statins, fi brates, and chloroquine are produced as generic medications in developing countries. They are inexpensive, could be stockpiled, and would be available on the fi rst pandemic day. With a lack of realistic alternatives for confronting the next pandemic, research is urgently needed to determine whether these and other generic agents could mitigate the eff ects of what might otherwise become an unprecedented global public-health crisis.",

If it is imminent, adequate supplies of aff ordable vaccines will be unavailable to most people in the world.

Both groups of investigators studied experimental infections in small groups of knockout mice in which the genes for individual proinfl ammatory cytokines and chemokines had been deleted. Szretter and co-workers 11 found that deleting interleukin 6 or macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP) 1\u03b1 had no eff ect on highly pathogenic H5N1 disease or virus replication, whereas lack of interleukin-1-receptor signalling enhanced disease and delayed virus clearance. Lack of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1 also increased disease severity but had no eff ect on virus replication or outcome. The investigators commented that because of the functional redundancy of many cytokines and chemokines, deleting more than one of these genes might have had a greater (presumably more adverse) eff ect on the course of disease, and concluded that mice are suitable for evaluating agents that \"modulate the infl ammatory response induced by H5N1 viruses, either alone or in combination with antiviral therapy\". 11 Salomon and colleagues 12 also studied H5N1 infections in groups of mice in which diff erent genes had been deleted-TNF\u03b1, TNF receptor 1, both TNF receptor 1 and TNF receptor 2, interleukin 6, and CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 2. 12 Each of these deletions failed to protect mice from death caused by a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. The researchers concluded that their results \"refute the popular paradigm that cytokine storm is the cause of death during H5N1 infection\". 12 They added: \"inhibiting the host cytokine response is not suffi cient to reduce morbidity and lethality of the viral infection\u2026early inhibition of viral replication is more promising than inhibition of the cytokine response in promoting host survival of H5N1 infl uenza virus infection\". 12 Experts writing on behalf of WHO have concluded that",

            "text": "Interest in agents that might control the host immune response to pandemic infl uenza virus infection was initially focused on the group of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors known as statins. 6 Laboratory and clinical studies by cardiovascular investigators have shown that statins have pronounced anti-infl ammatory and immunomodulatory (pleiotropic) eff ects. Several clinical studies have shown that statins decrease mortality in patients with bacterial sepsis. 6, 22, 23 These benefi ts are thought to be caused by a multiplicity of molecular eff ects that refl ect statin modifi cation of intracellular signalling cascades, a process that has been likened to \"reducing the heat under a boiling kettle\". 24 Four observational studies of statins and pneumonia have been published (table) . [25] [26] [27] [28] In a case-control study, van de Garde and colleagues 25 reported that recent prescriptions for statins were associated with a 50% reduction in pneumonia hospital admissions in diabetic patients. In another case-control study, Schlienger and co-workers 26 showed that current prescriptions for statins (within 30 days) were associated with a 53% reduction in 30-day pneumonia mortality. In a retrospective cohort study by Mortensen and colleagues, 27 current statin use was associated with a 46% reduction in 30-day pneumonia mortality. However, Majumdar and colleagues 28 reached a diff erent conclusion; their prospective cohort study failed to demonstrate a benefi cial eff ect of statins and they ascribed the apparent benefi ts of statin treatment seen in other studies to a \"healthy user eff ect\". Although the healthy user eff ect does exist and can be important, many \"healthy users\" in the study by Schlienger and colleagues 26 had been given statins in the past (more than 30 days before hospital admission) but were not taking them currently, yet only current users were protected. None of these investigations was able to show whether statins given after pneumonia hospitalisation were associated with protection, unlike an earlier report showing a remarkable reduction in bacteraemiaattributable mortality with in-hospital statin treatment. 22 An observational study of hospitalised pneumonia patients is now underway to address this important question. Recently, investigators in South Korea reported preliminary results from a randomised controlled trial of statin treatment in 67 pneumonia patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). 29 Treatment with atorvastatin (10 mg daily) was associated with a 45\u00b74% reduction in ICU mortality (p=0\u00b708) and a 51\u00b72% reduction in hospital mortality (p=0\u00b7026).",

            "text": "Chloroquine has been suggested as one such agent. This drug has well-established anti-infl ammatory activity and is sometimes used to treat immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. 45 Chloroquine's antiviral activity against infl uenza viruses was fi rst demonstrated in the early 1980s and within the past few years it has also been Personal View shown to possess in-vitro antiviral activity against other viruses, including HIV-1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. [45] [46] [47] [48] Chloroquine accumulates in the endosome where it interferes with acidifi cation and thereby impairs viral fusion and release into the cytosol. Diff erent infl uenza virus subtypes respond diff erently to chloroquine, with H3N2 and H1N1 viruses being more susceptible than certain H5 viruses. 48 Structural determinants on subunit 2 of the haem agglutinin molecule seem to determine the antiviral response. The in-vitro antiviral eff ects of chloroquine and the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir have been shown to be additive. 48 The in-vivo effi cacy of chloroquine was recently tested in models of infl uenza A H1N1 virus infection in mice and H3N2 infection in ferrets. 49 Chloroquine treatment was not associated with clinical improvement, but virus titres in lung tissue (mice) and nasal wash specimens (ferrets) obtained later in the course of illness were reported to be lower in treated animals compared with controls. This fi nding suggests that an antiviral eff ect might have occurred but that it failed to bring about clinical improvement because cytokine dysregulation was able to proceed regardless of whether virus replication continued or was suppressed. If this is what happened, it is conceivable that limiting virus replication with chloroquine while at the same time treating the immune response with a fi brate, statin, or other promising agents might have led to clinical recovery. Support for this interpretation comes from another report on the proinfl ammatory and antiinfl ammatory responses of infl uenza virus-infected mice with secondary pneumococcal pneumonia. 50 In this model, there were no diff erences in the outcomes of mice with or without bacteraemia or with high or low levels of bacterial growth in their lungs; all mice in all groups developed rapidly fatal illness. When mice were dually infected with infl uenza virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae and then treated with either ampicillin or clindamycin, ampicillin was more eff ective in clearing pneumococci from the lung, but survival was improved with clindamycin. 51 It seems that factors determining survival involved something more than killing the infecting pneumococci. In other studies of mice infected with infl uenza viruses alone, other macrolides have been shown to inhibit nitric oxide production, increase interleukin 12 in broncho alveolar fl uid, reduce both virus replication and pulmonary infl ammation, and improve survival. 52, 53 Other inexpensive and widely distributed agents should also be considered for their potential as antivirals against infl uenza. 4 For example, resveratrol, a polyphenol with antioxidant properties that is found in red wine, has been shown to inhibit replication of infl uenza viruses in vitro and reduce mortality and virus titres in the lungs of infected mice. 54 Its antiviral activity does not depend on its antioxidant properties; instead, resveratrol blocks the translocation of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during the late stage of infection, probably by interfering with the activity of several protein kinases. Resveratrol also targets TLR cell signalling pathways and interferes with the related upregulation of several proinfl ammatory cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the infl ammatory host response. 55 These important fi ndings appear to have attracted no attention from infl uenza scientists.",
