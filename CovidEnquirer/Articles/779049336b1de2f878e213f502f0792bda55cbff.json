The International Bioethics Committee (IBC) of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization) recommended that \"PGD be limited to medical indications. Therefore sex selection for non-medical reasons is considered to be unethical.\" 3 Nevertheless PGD is also practised, and sometimes morally and legally justified, in developed countries. The debate in frontier bioethics concerns mainly the right of parents to decide the characteristics of their children.",

In 1992, Amartya Sen 4 showed the existence-on the basis of changes in the ratio of women to men in the total population of Asia and Africa-of hundreds of millions of missing women caused by similar actions. Worldwide indignation and appropriate cultural and legal measures have been taken in several countries to reduce this situation. Did anything change? Sen revisited the data in 2003, 5 and reported that the reduction in female overmortality has been counterbalanced by the spread of sexselective abortion against the female fetus, and as a result the number of missing women is now greater. Embryos, fetuses, or babies can be selected by many methods from different cultures, which manifest a unique and crude tendency-this selection is a sharp and visible aspect of gender inequality. In developed countries, acceptance of sex selection through biotechnological methods can hinder any effort to reduce any kind of sex selection in any part of the world.",

If a person's destiny is to become social, cultural, and moral clones, why should genetic cloning not be permitted? Perhaps human liberty and self-determination should prevail over all limits and obstacles, either due to social and gender injustice or manipulation of minds; use of science in favour of genetic arrogance would deny or discourage the daily efforts of any person to build autonomously his or her own future.",

The 32nd session of UNESCO in October, 2003, judged setting of universal standards in this area to be imperative and desirable, and invited the Director General \"to continue preparatory work on a declaration, and to submit a draft declaration at its 33rd session in 2005, involving from the very beginning States, the United Nations and the other specialized agencies of the UN system, other inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations and appropriate national bodies and specialists\". 13 I know by personal experience in the IBC (in which I was a rapporteur) that to proceed from a feasibility study to a universal declaration on bioethics is almost impossible, but trying is worthwhile.

The idea of the priority of primary health care and of the prevention accessible to everybody has been supplanted by high technologies, even in countries where the resources are minimal. Discussions on resources for health have been restricted to monetary aspects, ignoring the many possibilities of human resources, of changes in environment and workplace, and of improvements in nutrition and education. The need to identify priorities and to distribute fairly the resources for health care is replaced by the idea of rationing them: not through priorities and universal inclusion, but through selective exclusion.

These trends became very influential culturally, although they were politically contradicted by the orientations of the dominant powers. Health was reintroduced to the international political agenda. In many countries, researchers have shown a growing interest in health equity, inspired either by their moral and scientific sensitivity, or by evidence. The main efforts were inspired by the attempt to integrate altruism and self-interest, to reconsider health as an indivisible good, and by the refusal of simple charitable transfers of benefits among countries or groups. This is an old idea, now defined as compassionate conservatism, which may include the virtue of ethics but has two faults: (1) those who are helped are placed in a compromising, dependent position, treated as victims not agents; and (2) societal rules and structures that generate such social consequences are not addressed.",

One is that the inequity in health, which often means life or death, raises higher indignation than other inequities concerning income or material goods. The other is an increased knowledge of reality through public inquiries, books, 18 medical journals, and campaigns. A few years ago, Amartya Sen, closing in Dhaka the Bangladesh session of the Global Equity in Health Initiative in 1998, said: \"Information concerning discrimination, torture, poverty, illness, and abandonment helps coalesce the forces opposing these events by extending the opposition to the general public. This is because the people have the capacity and willingness of reacting to other people's difficulties.\"",

Mandela made the decision to ignore the patent to make therapies accessible for the poor population, in a country where one in nine people is HIVpositive. After global criticism from governments, nongovernmental organisations, HIV/AIDS specialists, and a globalised movement mainly organised through the internet, the pharmaceutical companies decided not to pursue the case. After a bitter struggle between the companies and WHO, new rules were adopted. It is now possible to suspend or limit the royalties for \"intellectual property\" in case of widespread epidemics: a partial victory in what could be called, perhaps improperly, conflict between patents and patients. Later, in October, 2003, the South African Competition Commission concluded that the companies \"had overcharged for the drugs and had limited their licensing to competitors to try to suppress competition\"; 19 and finally, in December of that year, GlaxoSmithKline and Boehringer Ingelheim, while still rejecting the accusation, agreed to reduce the price for therapy by as much as 90%. A door has been opened for new international rules on everyday bioethics.",

The consequences of this failure may be contradictory, but surely a new factor emerged: the formation of an alliance between more than 20 developing countries who represent more than half of the world's population, and antiglobalisation movements. Developing countries have been deeply divided in the past 20-30 years, and have had almost no voice in the international arena. Cultural and political antiglobalisation groups had already gained publicity in Seattle 4 years ago, and now had common goals with many governments. So far, the main result is the defeat of the proposal to extend rules governing the trade of commodities to the services for persons, such as health and education, and to natural resources. The argument has been that such services affect human rights, are essential for human life and growth, and that nations should decide how to guarantee them to all citizens.",

From an ethical point of view, it restricts the range of individuals who could contribute to society; it might demobilise popular, intellectual, and political energies; it introduces a rigid separation between those who are considered good and those who are branded evil; and it weakens the duties of public authorities and international institutions to face other individual and collective needs.
