One such example is the activation of mast cells, basophils and eosinophils via the stimulation of the FceRI receptor by IgE/allergen complexes. The possible role of Syk in inflammatory signaling cascades has led to the development of pharmacological agents designed to block the Syk catalytic domain as potential novel therapeutics. Whilst the enzymatic activity of Syk lends towards the design of small-molecule inhibitors, other attention has focused on the possibility of targeting Syk expression using anti-sense oligonucleotides as an alternate means of anti-inflammatory therapy. In this study, we compared the ability of multiple optimized Syk siRNA sequences and small-molecule Syk inhibitors to block FceRI-mediated signal transduction, degranulation and TNFa secretion in the basophilic cell line RBL-2H3. We also characterized the specificity of each siRNA sequence with regards to off-target induction of the interferon-inducible gene IFIT1. We identified a single siRNA sequence, which displayed a favorable profile of efficient Syk knockdown, blockage of FceRI-mediated signal transduction, degranulation and TNFa secretion and a lack of IFIT1 induction. The effect of this siRNA was comparable to that of the Syk kinase domain inhibitors BAY61-3606 and R406. The identification of an active and specific Syk siRNA could be a basis for the development of therapeutic Syk siRNAs against inflammatory diseases.",

Following the assembly and activation of this complex of proteins, activation of MAPKs, calcium-flux and PLCc1 and PLCc2 phosphorylation lead to degranulation, lipid mediator and cytokine synthesis. Syk has gathered a great deal of attention as a potentially novel target for the treatment of allergic and other inflammatory disorders [3, 10, 11] .

In addition, the Syk substrates LAT (tyrosine 226) and SLP-76 (tyrosine 128) as well as the associated protein PLCc1 (tyrosine 783) and downstream protein Erk (threonine 202/tyrosine 204) were also phosphorylated. A general activation of protein tyrosine phosphorylation with predominant signals at 100, 70-75 and 55 kDa was also observed in response to FceRI receptor crosslinking. Consistent with results presented above (Fig. 2) , Syk siRNA A was the most potent in reducing levels of Syk protein. Sequences J and H were respectively less potent than sequence A. The phosphorylation of LAT, SLP-76, PLCc1 and Erk was decreased by Syk siRNAs in a manner that directly correlated with their effects on Syk expression. Interestingly, whilst the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at 100 and 70-75 kDa was reduced by Syk siRNAs, the phosphorylation of the 55 kDa protein was slightly enhanced. This suggests that the phosphorylation of this unidentified 55 kDa protein could be negatively regulated by Syk in response to FceRI receptor crosslinking. The total levels of LAT, SLP-76, PLCc1, Erk and b-actin were not affected by the Syk siRNAs indicating that the observed reduction in their respective phospho-forms was due to a decrease in their phosphorylation and not a decrease in their stability or expression.",

Sequence G was shown above to knockdown Syk protein to a lesser extent than siRNAs A and J. Consistent with this, the release of b-hexosaminidase was inhibited to a lesser extent.

Meanwhile, recent reports have sug- gested that Syk may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of B and T cell lymphomas [33, 34] . Current approaches towards Syk inhibition include the use of small molecule kinase domain inhibitors and in particular the R406 compound has shown efficacy in animal and human models of RA [16, 32] and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) [35] .",

These approaches potentially enable the reduction of gene expression as a means of target modulation as an alternative to the action of small-molecule inhibitors for which there are only a limited number of 'druggable' targets. Aerolized Syk anti-sense oligonucleotides have been show to reduce Syk expression in alveolar macrophages and also blocked IgG/antigen-complex induced nitric oxide and TNFa release, pulmonary infiltration of inflammatory cells and allergic contraction of the trachea [36] [37] [38] . These studies highlight the potential efficacy of targeting Syk expression levels as a novel therapeutic principle in airway inflammatory diseases.

Syk siRNAs A-C and E-J all knocked down Syk mRNA and protein expression and each tested siRNA was also able to block FceRI-induced signal transduction, degranulation and TNFa release in a manner similar to the Syk inhibitors BAY61-3606 and R406. Interestingly, the commonly used and published Syk inhibitor piceatannol was shown to block RBL-2H3 cell degranulation and TNFa release at concentrations which did not affect Sykmediated signal transduction. This highlights the Syk-independent anti-inflammatory properties of this compound that must be considered in future studies. The blockage of FceRI signaling by each siRNA was directly proportional to their effect on Syk expression. These results not only suggest a fundamental role of Syk in FceRI signaling, but also demonstrate the efficacy of the siRNA approach in the targeting of FceRI-dependent allergic responses.",

            "text": "The clinical potential of siRNAs is somewhat limited by complications associated with activation of cellular anti-viral interferoninducible genes and unanticipated off-target effects on other mRNAs. Syk siRNA A was a unique sequence in that it displayed the most potent knockdown of Syk expression and reduction of FceRI-activated signaling and cellular responses, coupled with a lack of effect on the cellular IFN response. Furthermore, Affymetrics analysis of the effect of Syk siRNA A on the global expression of rat mRNAs in RBL-2H3 cells revealed no off-target regulatory effects (data not shown). The identification of this sequence and its desirable in vitro profile, raises the possibility of this sequence becoming a candidate for progress into Syk-dependent diseases models in vivo. Other limiting factors for potential siRNA therapeutics include complications regarding the efficient delivery to specific target cells and the maintenance of siRNA in vivo stability. Airway delivery of siRNAs via inhalation has the advantage of potentially limiting systemic distribution of the molecules, whilst locally targeting airway cells and their genes [39] [40] [41] . Airway siR-NAs have already demonstrated efficient local knockdown of targets including heme oxygenase-1 [42] , glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [43] as well as the blockage of the replication and pathogenicity influenza virus A [44] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [45, 46] and SARS coronavirus (SCV) [47] .

A paired Student's ttest was used to compare the statistical significance of the difference between data points. With the exception of Syk siRNAs C and H (marked with an asterisk), no significant increase in IFIT1 expression relative to the GAPDH siRNA control was observed with a p-value of less than 0.05. Knockdown of Syk reduces FceRI-mediated signal transduction in a manner similar to Syk kinase inhibitors.(A) RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with active Syk siRNAs A, G and J or the control siRNA against GAPDH and then treated with or without the FceRI-crosslinking antibody. Total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot for expression and phosphorylation of Syk (tyrosine 346), SLP-76 (tyrosine 128), LAT (tyrosine 226), PLCc1 (tyrosine 783), Erk (threonine 202/tyrosine 204) and total tyrosinephosphorylated proteins. Total levels of each protein as well as b-actin were also analyzed. (B) Untransfected RBL-2H3 cells were treated with the Syk small molecule kinase inhibitors BAY61-3606 (1 and 0.1 lM), R406 (1 and 0.1 lM) and piceatannol (20, 10 and 1 lM) and then activated with the FceRI-crosslinking antibody. The phosphorylation of the same proteins mentioned in part A of this figure was analyzed by Western blot. Total Syk and b-actin levels were analyzed to control for protein loading.",
