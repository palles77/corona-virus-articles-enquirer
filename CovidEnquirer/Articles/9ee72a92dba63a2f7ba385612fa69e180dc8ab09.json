The ability of some poor, resource-limited, developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa to efficiently handle the epidemic within their shores provides some lessons learned for the global health community. Among others, the 2014 EVD epidemic teaches us that it is time to put the \"P\" back in public and population health around the world. The global health community must support a sustainable strategy to mitigate Ebola virus and other epidemics both within and outside their shores, even after the cameras are gone. Ebola virus must not be called the disease of the poor and developing world.",

For the US, it was the nation's first case of EVD transmitted across international lines. The patient, now deceased, contracted Ebola virus and travelled to US from his native Liberia, one of the West African country at the center of what has become one of the most challenging infectious disease outbreaks and national security threats in modern times. [1, 2] The other four countries are Guinea, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. For Spain, it was the nation's first case of an indigenous Ebola virus infection for a nurse, who had earlier cared for two Spaniard missionaries who later died from the virus which they contracted in West Africa.

For the US and Spain, the events around the EVD cases have raised fundamental questions about the preparedness of the healthcare systems in advanced countries to handle the EVD epidemic, should that occur, despite the rhetorical presentation of their sophistication and invincibility. In Spain, federal authorities have asked for explanations on how the nurse contracted the virus. [3] In the US, the Ebola patient was released from hospital even after he reported that he had travelled from Liberia only to be readmitted when his condition worsened. Hospital and health officials have scrambled to advance such reasons ranging from human error, software malfunction, down to the assertion, in some quarters, that the patient was turned away because he did not have health insurance-the traditional gateway to getting into the healthcare system in the US.

[5] Given the historical and scientific antecedents of health disparities in the US, these reactions are understandable, and the fears are, to a large extent founded. Plethora of research has documented that one of the leading and fundamental causes of health disparities in the US stems from the fact that minorities, the poor, and immigrants do not receive the same care in the US healthcare system as their majority, affluent, and native-born counterparts. [6, 7] Studies have also documented that minorities were less likely to be offered experimental treatments even when access was not the issue. [8, 9, 10] The treatment or lack of treatment of the Liberian-born Ebola patient in the US has once again ignited somber thoughts of the past including the Tuskegee experiments, where blacks in US were enrolled in clinical trials without their knowledge. [8] The production of new experimental drugs, no doubt, takes a long time. It is also unknown if these experimental drugs work. [11] However, many people, locally and internationally, have questioned the US public officials' moral high ground in asserting that the experimental ZMapp, that drug was administered to the two prior US citizens, was unavailable for the treatment of the now deceased only non-US citizen-patient in the US soil. While these are continuing, news reports indicate that as many as over 4,500 people, and counting, have succumbed to this deadly virus in the affected West African countries at the time of this commentary. [12] These affected West African countries already have among the world's worst global health indicators and need our help now (see Table 1 / Figure 1 ). The fact that advanced healthcare systems in the Western world are grappling and failing with few cases of Ebola, and its aftermath, tells us that this is not like any other. Its present and future calamities cannot be wished away. Ebola should not be relegated to the background as often happens to diseases afflicting the poor and developing countries. The global health community must not leave these nations at the mercy of a deadly virus.",

The US has also instituted increased screening for airline passengers in the US and Africa, [13] a practice that had been in place since the outbreak started by the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Nigeria. The US has also dispatched a team of public health officials to learn how Africa's most-populous country, Nigeria, and Senegal, among the world's poorest nation, were able to mitigate the spread of the virus in their countries.

IJMA was founded to be \"a fertile ground to cultivate a global intellectual coalition to highlight the issues in hinterlands of developing countries.\" [15] It is interesting that the US is sending health experts to Nigeria, the global South, to learn from their experience on handling the EVD outbreak.

The realities of the current Ebola epidemic and past disease outbreaks such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome), Bird flu (H5N1 Avian flu), BSE (aka the mad cow disease), etc., present some of the profound reasons to agree that \"local health is global health\" and \"global health is local health.\" This theme has not been lost in human ideologies.

It is very often that we see policy makers and public health officials deal with public health issues in the abstract, reeling out mere numbers, policies and layers of guidance, but unfortunately relegating to the background, the public which is the very essence of public and population health. As depicted in the US experience, a sophisticated healthcare system is important in handling an outbreak such as Ebola, but it is not a panacea to dealing with the attendant manageable fallouts of a rapidly unfolding outbreak. The people are. Nigeria's ability to mitigate the catastrophic outbreak in Africa's most-populous country was benchmarked on the nation's ability to mobilize the entire citizenry to participate in the national effort, a practice referred to in the language of epidemiologists as \"contact tracing.\" While the country was battling the outbreak, every citizen became the guard and guardian of the entire society.",

People reported those in their neighborhoods who showed signs of EVD and asked them to seek medical help. People were part of the overall \"contact tracing\" by using text messages to contact health officials. The role of the people was so instrumental that, at one time, the country was agog with the notion of a cure for EVD by \"bathing with salt.\" The fake cure started from a message sent out a local traditional ruler to his by subjects. This single communication went viral on the social media and everyone was bathing with salt water to prevent and or cure EVD. Even as unscientific as this incident is, the fact that this practice went viral within a few hours bears testimony to the level of communal sharing between people, friends, families, colleagues and even stran gers during such emergency. This is the \"P\" in public health in action. It is this \"P\" in public health that the western health officials must learn from their Nigerian and Senegalese counterparts. [16, 17] ",

[6, 7] For example, the governments must engage the public especially minorities, population characterized health dispari ties, and front line healthcare workers and reassure them that it is rolling out concrete steps to handle the outbreak. The public health system must take immediate actions to stem its failings in the handling of this volatile virus and its aftermath which is quickly eroding and putting a wedge in the public's trust of the entire public health system. Above all, the global health community, led by the World Health Organization, must urge wealthy nations to afford equal access and opportunities to public health and clinical trials products to all peoples within their shores irrespective of ability, or socioeconomic status.",
