The evaluation also should review the medical and immunization history of the child to ensure that appropriate advice is given regarding preventive measures, including necessary vaccines. This evaluation can be accomplished by providing a form for parents to complete and bring to the initial pretravel assessment visit. Particular attention should be given to children of immigrants who are returning to their home countries to visit friends and relatives (VFR) because these children have been shown to be at increased risk for many infectious diseases. 1, 5, 6 Many excellent resources, most of which are accessible online, provide pretravel advice for pediatricians (Box 8.1).",

Adolescent travelers should be counseled regarding safer sex practices and risks of body piercing and tattooing in less developed countries. Freshwater exposure of any kind should be avoided in areas that are endemic for schistosomiasis or where Leptospira species can contaminate the water. Exposure to infected stool of animals or humans can result in several types of parasitic infection either directly (e.g., hookworm) or through fecal-oral exposure (e.g., Toxocara spp.).

The vaccine is only available in the US from providers certified by state health departments. 49 A yellow fever vaccine-associated encephalitis syndrome has been reported in young infants at a rate of 0.5 to 4 per 1000 infants vaccinated. 17 Neurologic symptoms occur 7 to 21 days after immunization; disease is related to reversion of vaccine virus to wild-type neurotropic virus. Consequently, the vaccine is contraindicated in infants <6 months of age. For infants 6 to 9 months of age who cannot avoid travel to a yellow feverendemic area, consultation with an expert in the field is recommended.

Preexposure rabies immunization is recommended for travelers with an occupational risk of exposure, for people planning extended stays in endemic areas where medical care is limited, and for outdoor travelers. 50 However, studies suggest that animal bites often occur during short-term travel. 51 Given that children are more likely to interact with animals and not report an animal bite, rabies preexposure vaccination should be considered for children traveling to endemic countries for at least 1 month. 52 The preexposure vaccine is 3 doses of 1.0 mL each given intramuscularly at 0, 7, and 21 or 28 days. 50 The series can be administered using either of the 2 licensed vaccines in the US: human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV). If a vaccinated child is bitten or sustains a skin-penetrating scratch by a potentially rabid animal, the wound must be washed thoroughly, and 2 additional doses must be completed as soon as possible (given 3 days apart); rabies IG is not required. 53 Without preexposure immunization, rabies IG and 4 doses of an approved vaccine (given over 14 days) are required; however, rabies IG is often not available in many developing countries. 53 The Culex species mosquitoes that transmit Japanese encephalitis virus also bite primarily between dusk and dawn, whereas the Aedes species mosquitoes that transmit dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses bite primarily during the day. When a risk of insect exposure exists, children should be dressed in light-colored clothing that covers their arms and legs. Other measures to avoid insect bites include staying in air-conditioned or well-screened accommodation or using insecticide-treated bed nets. Chemical protection provides additional defense against insect-borne diseases. The safest and best studied is N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET). 59 Although adverse reactions, such as encephalopathy and rashes, have been described with excessive or prolonged use of high concentrations of DEET in children, this compound is considered safe when used appropriately according to product label instructions (Box 8.3). 58, 63 The concentration of DEET correlates with the duration of protection; therefore, products with lower concentrations must be reapplied. DEET is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics in concentrations up to 30% for children as young as 2 months of age; in standard preparations, this concentration provides 4 to 6 hours of protection. 64 Non-DEET-containing repellents such as picaridin, IR3535, and oil of lemon eucalyptus appear to be safe and well tolerated but must be reapplied more frequently. 61 Oil of lemon eucalyptus is not recommended in children <3 years of age.",

In addition, characteristics of the individual traveler, including age, ability to swallow tablets, and any specific contraindications, are relevant. 59 Breastfeeding infants require prophylaxis because antimalarial drugs do not reach high enough levels in human milk. Several medications are recommended for prevention of malaria in children: chloroquine, mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone/proguanil. 59, 60 Chloroquine is inexpensive and well tolerated, but it is of limited efficacy because of resistance to Plasmodium falciparum in all regions except parts of the Caribbean and Central America. Atovaquone/ proguanil is typically the best tolerated, but it is the most expensive. It is approved for children >5 kg and comes as pediatric tablets. Mefloquine is safe for use in pregnancy and neonates and has the convenience of weekly dosing. Adult tablets need to be broken and compounded into a liquid. Neuropsychiatric side effects limit its tolerability, and increasing resistance is reported in Southeast Asia. 60 Doxycycline is contraindicated in children <9 years of age because of dental staining. Primaquine is recommended as a primary agent in areas with a high incidence of Plasmodium vivax, such as Central America, and as a second-line agent in other areas when other antimalarial drugs cannot be used (see Chapter 271). 61 Chloroquine should be initiated 1 to 2 weeks before travel and preferably 4 weeks before travel for mefloquine; doxycycline, atovaquone/proguanil, and primaquine can be started 1 day before exposure. Most chemoprophylactic agents must be continued for 4 weeks after departure from malaria-endemic areas except for atovaquone/proguanil and primaquine, which must be continued for only 1 week after exposure. However, in an atovaquone/proguanil prophylaxis study in 485 Israeli subjects, 87% discontinued the drug 1 day after travel; no cases of malaria occurred, suggesting a shorter duration after travel can be adequate. 62 Updated guidelines from national organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel (CATMAT) can be found online (see Box 8.1).",

Oral rehydration therapy using a homemade or commercially prepared oral rehydration solution (ORS) can be used to prevent dehydration associated with diarrheal disease. Commercial ORS should be used to treat mild to moderate dehydration; severe dehydration can require intravenous fluid resuscitation. 75, 76 ORS packets should be part of a family's travel medical kit. Locally made preparations can be used early in therapy, although they differ in composition from the reduced-osmolarity ORS recommended by the WHO (Table 8 .3). 75 For infants, breastfeeding should be continued, along with oral rehydration and solid food intake, although foods high in simple sugars should be avoided because the increased osmotic load can worsen fluid losses.",

Although loperamide has been shown to decrease the duration and severity of acute diarrhea in children, it has been associated with significant side effects in children and is not recommended for children <3 years of age. [76] [77] [78] Zinc supplementation has been associated with improved outcomes in diarrheal disease in children in developing countries, but zinc supplementation is not recommended in treatment of travelers' diarrhea. 76 Empiric treatment with antimicrobial agents can be considered in pediatric travelers' diarrhea. However, treatment should be confined to moderate to severe diarrhea, given data that show a marked increased carriage of extended spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae with antibiotic use. 79 Azithromycin often is used as the first choice for treatment of pediatric travelers' diarrhea, especially in areas with a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species (e.g., South and Southeast Asia), because the drug is given once a day and has a known safety profile in children. A dose of 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days (maximum dose of 500 mg) is appropriate. 67 In adults, a single dose of antibiotic has been shown to be as effective as 3 days of treatment; therefore, in children a full 3-day course may not be necessary. 80, 81 Fluoroquinolones for 1 to 3 days are the drug of choice for adults with travelers' diarrhea that is moderate to severe, persistent (>3 days), or associated with fever or bloody stools. Although concerns exist regarding the potential for development of arthropathy and antimicrobial resistance with fluoroquinolone use in children, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved ciprofloxacin for anthrax and as a second-line agent for the treatment of urinary tract infections in children from 1 through 17 years of age. 82 Therefore, fluoroquinolones could be considered safe in children for the short course required for travelers' diarrhea. A 1-to 3-day course of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day divided twice daily with a maximum dose of 500 mg twice daily is recommended for children with moderate to severe or bloody diarrhea. 67 Rifaximin (Xifaxan), a nonabsorbed rifamycin derivative, has been approved in the US for treatment and prevention of travelers' diarrhea for people \u226512 years of age. 83 A liquid preparation is available in some rates of approximately 40%. Although travelers' diarrhea generally is a self-limited infection, it can cause significant morbidity, particularly if it results in moderate to severe dehydration. Parents must be counseled regarding the symptoms and signs of dehydration, as well as the approach to oral rehydration and when to seek medical attention. 71 ",

Children who develop fever after travel should seek immediate medical attention, and parents must inform physicians caring for them of their travel itinerary. This is particularly critical if the itinerary has included a malaria-endemic area given that chemoprophylaxis cannot prevent all cases of malaria. Because malaria can manifest with nonspecific symptoms in children, any symptoms of fever, rigors, headache, malaise, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, poor feeding, or cough following travel to an endemic country should be evaluated promptly by a physician. 52, 87 Travel-related illness has been shown to be highly dependent on itinerary. In a report of disease and relation to place of exposure among ill returned travelers, significant regional differences in proportionate morbidity were reported. 4 Typhoid fever was seen most frequently in travelers returning from South Asia. Malaria was the most frequent cause of febrile illness among travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa, whereas dengue was a more frequent cause of fever in most other areas. Rickettsial infections, primarily tickborne spotted fever, occur more frequently than malaria or dengue among travelers returning from South Africa. 4 All references are available online at www.expertconsult.com.",

Killed or subunit vaccines can be administered to children with altered immunity, although responses to the vaccines can be diminished. 85 Asplenic patients may respond poorly to polysaccharide vaccines in particular. Patients with certain B-lymphocyte deficiencies, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency, should avoid OPV, vaccinia, and live bacterial vaccines, although other patients with humoral immunodeficiencies, including selective immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgG subclass deficiency, must avoid only OPV; other live vaccines can be considered.",
