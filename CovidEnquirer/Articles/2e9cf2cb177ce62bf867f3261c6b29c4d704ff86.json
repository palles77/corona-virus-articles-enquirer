Hence, it is not surprising that patients with significantly impaired immunity frequently develop lung infections. Immunodeficient patients also frequently have several other risk factors that contribute to an increased risk for development of pneumonia, including lowlevel microaspi ration of oropharyngeal contents, mucosal damage caused by cytotoxic therapy, underlying lung damage, and poor nutrition. As a consequence, lung infections are a common and frequently serious complication in patients with significant impairment of the immune system. Pulmonary infiltrates occur in 25% of patients with neutropenia developing after chemotherapy, and up to 5% of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell trans plantation (HSCT) will die as a result of pneumonia. The range of potential pathogens causing lung infections in immunocom promised patients is much broader than for the usual patho gens causing communityacquired pneumonia and includes organisms such as Aspergillus fumigatus and human cytomega lovirus (CMV); the diagnosis of infections due to these microbes can be difficult, and the required therapies frequently are toxic. The large number of potential pathogens and the background disease together make management of lung infection in immu nocompromised patients considerably more complex, and the use of invasive diagnostic tests such as bronchoscopy frequently is necessary. This chapter focuses on the common causative pathogens and the clinical approach to pulmonary infections in patients who have been severely immunocompromised by chemotherapy, organ transplantation, or hematologic disease (Box 28-1) but not human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in fection (discussed in Chapter 29). Pneumonia in patients with milder degrees of immunosuppression due to myeloma, low dose cytotoxic therapy, or diseasemodifying agents adminis tered for rheumatologic conditions generally should be managed as community or hospitalacquired pneumonia, but with rec ognition that the disease could be due to various opportunistic pathogens, as discussed in this chapter.",

The three main categories of immune defect are absolute or functional neutro penia, defects in cellmediated immunity, and deficiencies in antibody responses (a clinically less severely affected category). Each is associated with a particular range of pathogens (see Table 282 ). Patients with neutropenia are mainly at risk for infection with extracellular pathogens such as pyogenic bacte ria and filamentous fungi. Defects in cellmediated immunity tend to predispose affected patients to development of infec tions with intracellular pathogens such as viruses and myco bacteria, as well as some unusual extracellular infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Deficiencies in antibody responses result in a high incidence of infections due to encap sulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and to her pesviruses. Individual patients may have a combination of these immune defects; for example, lymphoma can cause impairment of cellmediated immunity that can be combined with neutro penia if the patient receives chemotherapy.",

The immune defects associated with HSCT depend on the conditioning regimen and type of graft, and evolve with time. In phase I, the preengraftment phase (15 to 45 days after transplantation), prolonged neutro penia and breaks in the mucocutaneous barrier increase the risk of bacterial and fungal infections. Herpes simplex virus reactivation also can occur during this phase. In phase II, the immediate postengraftment phase at around 30 to 100 days after transplantation, infections relate primarily to impaired cellmediated immunity and include those due to herpesviruses (particularly CMV) and PCP unless the patient is given pro phylaxis. During phase III, the late phase (beyond 100 days), common pathogens again include herpesviruses, but there is also a marked increased incidence of infection with encapsu lated bacteria such as S. pneumoniae, perhaps relating to impaired humoral immunity. Graftversushost disease also is associated with ongoing susceptibility to Aspergillus during phases II and III. For recipients of nonmyeloablative hemato poietic stem cell transplants, substantial differences may be observed during phase I, but susceptibility to infections during phases II and III is about the same. The risk of disease from communityacquired respiratory viruses is elevated in all three phases.",

            "text": "By combining the clinical pattern of presentation with knowledge of the patient's immune defect, a differential diag nosis of likely pathogens can be suggested. For example, infec tions developing rapidly over 1 to 3 days with a marked rise in serum inflammatory markers such as Creactive protein (CRP), pronounced fever, and focal radiologic changes are very likely to be due to infection with pyogenic bacteria. In a patient with a defect in cellmediated immunity, however, widespread ground glass infiltrations in both lungs developing over several days could represent CMV pneumonitis or PCP. In general, the more severe and prolonged the immune defect, the greater the range of possible causative pathogens and the less typical the clinical presentation for a particular pathogen, prompting the need for early invasive investigation if the initial therapy is failing to effect improvement. Furthermore the character of the disease can be dictated by the severity of the immune defect. For example, infections due to filamentous fungi such as Aspergillus progress faster with increasing severity of neutropenia, but may regress and become more focal when the neutrophil count recovers. Table 28 -3 shows the common conditions that should be considered for different presentations of lung com plications in immunocompromised patients. Many patients will be found to have dual pathologic processes, either involving two separate pathogens or with simultaneous noninfective (fluid overload being the most common) and infective prob lems, which will be responsible for separate elements of the clinical picture.",

The patient should undergo careful clinical assessment, including a review of previous laboratory and radiologic findings; the high mortality associated with lung infections in immunocompro mised patients requires that this is initiated rapidly. The level of oxygenation will characterize the immediate risk to the patient and can also suggest likely pathogens as severe hypoxia is more likely with a bacterial lobar pneumonia, extensive PCP or viral infections. Chest radiographs are an essential first line investigation and are useful for monitoring progress. However, with the exception of lobar consolidation chest radiographs may not be sufficiently sensitive to make an accurate assess ment of the pattern of lung shadowing. Ultimately a computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax often is required. CT scans are approximately 20% more sensitive than chest radiographs at identifying lung involvement and also define whether new changes on a chest radiograph represent consolidation, nodules, ground glass infiltrates, or \"treeinbud\" changes. All patients with suspected new lung infection require blood and sputum cultures, as well as routine blood tests, and in many cases nasopharyngeal aspirate studies for identification of viruses, assessment of CMV status, and serum testing for fungal antigens (galactomannan or \u03b2Dglucan). An important ques tion for the respiratory physician is when to utilize more inva sive investigations, either bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and possibly transbronchial biopsy, percutaneous radiologically guided biopsy, or, on occasion, surgical biopsy, usually videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Which test should be used and when will depend to a large extent on the type of radiologic presentation-consolidation, diffuse ground glass infiltrates, treeinbud changes, and nodules-in accordance with the algorithms for each provided in Figures  282, 284 , 286, and 287, respectively. These suggested pro tocols balance the likelihood and necessity of a positive yield against the clinical probability that a particular disease will be identified with the potential complications of the investiga tions. These protocols are for general guidance; atypical presen tations and dual pathology are not uncommon, and an individual patient often will require a modified approach. Immunocom promised patients are also at high risk for development of a range of noninfective causes of lung disease, including pulmo nary edema, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (see Chapter 59). These conditions should always be considered in the differential diagnosis for new lung disease. The protocols are discussed in detail next.",

The chest radiograph may be normal in appearance or show non specific diffuse bilateral infiltrates. CT scan is more sensitive at identifying pulmonary infiltrates and classically shows bibasal symmetric ground glass opacities, septal line thickening, and multiple small centrilobular nodules (Figure 28-9) . More asym metric changes, consolidation, and effusions are not uncom mon, however. The main considerations in the differential diagnosis are IPS, druginduced pneumonitis, and, in patients not receiving effective prophylaxis, PCP. Serologic determina tion of either IgG or IgM has no place in the diagnosis of CMV disease, because these antibodies merely reflect previous expo sure. However, CMV reactivation is nowadays readily detected by identifying significant viremia through either measuring the level of pp65 antigenemia or CMV DNA using PCR assay in the blood. CMV viremia usually is detectable 2 to 5 days before any clinical manifestations. Unfortunately, CMV viremia is not always present in patients with CMV pneumonitis; conversely, evidence of reactivation does not necessarily mean that new lung infiltrates are due to CMV pneumonitis. The chance that CMV infection is responsible for new lung infiltrates is propor tional in part to the level of CMV in the blood, especially if the viral load increased rapidly. Definitive confirmation that CMV is causing pneumonia requires identification of CMV in the respiratory tract by FOB for BAL and preferably a trans bronchial biopsy, or possibly a VATS lung biopsy. The presence of \"owl's eye\" intranuclear inclusions on cytologic examination is pathognomonic for CMV infection and although this modal ity is rapid, it is a relatively insensitive test. CMV can be cul tured from respiratory samples using fibroblast cell culture to look for the distinctive cytopathogenic effect, but this takes at least a week and therefore is of little clinical benefit. The main diagnostic techniques for CMV pneumonitis are the relatively sensitive rapid tests for CMV antigens using BAL samples directly, or indirectly by probing cell cultures inoculated with the samples after 24 to 48 hours incubation (the shell vial or early antigen detection assays). Quantitative PCR assay on BAL fluid has been used to improve the predictive value for the diagnosis of CMV pneumonitis but requires further investigation.

Oral absorption is poor, but oral therapy with the valine ester valganciclovir has excel lent bioavailability.

Cidofovir causes both myelosuppression and renal toxicity, and patients should be prehydrated and given probeniced before initiation of treat ment. Patients with CMV disease also are frequently given hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as passive vaccination therapy. Very few studies have compared these drugs for efficacy in CMV pneumonia. Treatment lasts from 14 to 21 days and should be guided by blood tests measuring the level of CMV viremia.

Many different adenovirus serotypes exist, so pretransplant serology is not helpful. In HSCT, the risk of adenovirus infection is increased for allograft recipients, after T cell depletion or treatment with antithymocyte globulin (alem tuzumab), and for patients with graftversushost disease receiving systemic steroids. Clearance of adenovirus has been shown to be associated with recovery of adenovirusspecific T cell immunity. Few antiviral agents have in vivo activity against adenoviruses, and no randomized, placebocontrolled study of the source of infection in patients with pyrexia and a normal chest radiograph. Specific CT appearances for IPA include the halo sign, an area of lower attenuation shadowing around a nodule or patch of consolidation reported in 50% of cases of IPA and usually occurring in the first week of infection ( Figure  28-11) ; the air crescent sign, a partial cavity formed by infarcted necrotic lung, which is a very specific but lateronset sign occurring around the third week of infection; and an intrapulmonary cavity containing a fungal ball, especially associated with recovery of the patient's neutrophil count (see Figure 2811 ). The halo sign may be detected in other infections, with neo plasms (adenocarcinoma, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and metastases), and in vasculitis. Aspergillus has a predilection for growing into blood vessels, and patients with IPA may suffer fatal massive hemorrhage. Other manifestations of invasive Aspergillus infections affecting the lung include Aspergillus tracheobronchitis, chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA), and chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergil losis (CCPA).",

Hence, strong consideration should be given to biopsy of lung nodules not responding to conventional antibacterial antibiotics, especially if BAL was nondiagnostic. To decrease mortality by allowing rapid identification of cases of IPA before the fungal load is high, several noninvasive tests have been developed. These include detection of galactomannan or \u03b2D glucan cell wall antigen in the blood (or BAL fluid if FOB has been performed), or PCR assay for Aspergillus DNA from the blood or BAL fluid. These tests are highly sensitive and when used as surveillance in highrisk patients could lead to preemp tive antifungal therapy before clinically apparent disease has developed, leading to an improved mortality. However, detec tion of fungal DNA in a single sample of peripheral blood is a poor indicator of early invasive fungal infection, and galacto mannan antigen is not specific for Aspergillus spp., frequently giving falsepositive results (especially in patients treated with piperacillintazobactam or in young children). Despite these caveats, a negative galactomannan assay result makes active IPA infection unlikely. Serologic tests for antibodies to Aspergillus usually yield negative results in immunocompromised patients with IPA. Diagnosing chronic forms of IPA in less immunocompro mised patients often is difficult owing to lack of sensitivity of culture and the lack of data on the predictive values for antigen testing. CTguided or VATS biopsy frequently is necessary to exclude malignancy and to confirm fungal invasion of lung tissue. Aspergillus IgG levels usually are raised in patients with CCPA, but not necessarily so in those with CNPA.",

Hence, nonAspergillus filamentous fungal infection needs to be considered in patients with a clinical diagnosis of IPA who are not responding to antifungal therapy.

Doses, modes of action, and common toxicities for the different treatment options are given in Table 28 -6. Voriconazole may be more effective than amphotericin B for treating IPA, but which drug is used depends on the patient's tolerance for that agent and any preexisting medical conditions (e.g., amphotericin B should be avoided in patients with renal problems, and azoles in patients with liver disease). Itracon azole is less efficacious and should be reserved for oral treat ment in patients recovering from IPA after induction treatment with amphotericin B, caspofungin, or voriconazole or for the longterm treatment required for chronic forms of invasive aspergillosis. Drug levels probably should be monitored for patients receiving itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole, at least for patients on prolonged therapy. The role of combina tion therapy remains unclear, but this strategy is potentially attractive in view of different mechanisms of action for the three effective classes of drugs. Urgent surgical resection should be considered in patients with major hemoptysis, because fatal bleeding is not uncommon. Elective resection can be used as primary therapy for single lesions due to IPA, especially those containing an intracavitary mycetoma that might lead to reac tivation of IPA during subsequent immunosuppression. Treat ment of IPA for several weeks often is necessary, followed by prophylactic therapy in cases with persisting radiologic changes. Treatment of CNPA and CCPA will need to be continued for months if not years (and even lifelong). Owing to a combina tion of uncontrolled infection and the underlying disease, the mortality rate for IPA is around 50%, and with chronic forms of aspergillosis, the infection rate remains as high as 33%. in an atrisk patient and should be confirmed by cytologic identification of the characteristic P. jirovecii cysts in BAL fluid. Diagnosis can be improved using immunohistochemistry assay for Pneumocystis antigens, and perhaps by PCR analysis, although the latter will have a significant falsepositive rate as a consequence of colonization in the absence of disease. Firstline treatment is with highdose cotrimoxazole and adjuvant steroids given according to the protocols used for PCP in HIVinfected patients. Myelosuppression due to cotrimoxazole means that many patients with hematologic disorders have to switch to secondline therapy with clindamy cin and primaquine. In nonHIV immunocompromised patients, PCP is associated with intubation and mortality rates of around 30% each. PCP prophylaxis usually is prescribed for several months after allograft HSCT or organ transplantation, and occasionally longer in patients who continue to receive immu nosuppressive drugs. Patients recovering from PCP should con tinue on chemoprophylaxis until their immunosuppression is resolved, although there are no clear parameters for defining this endpoint. Consensus is lacking on the requirement for PCP prophylaxis after autograft HSCT and for severe nontransplantationrelated immunosuppression. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis given either daily or three times per week is very effective (greater than 90% efficacy) and provides some protec tion against other pathogens, including Toxoplasma, Nocardia, and bacteria.",
