We found significant non-random structure in the lion-pathogen co-occurrence network and identified potential facilitative and competitive interactions between acute and chronic pathogens.

Individuals are often co-infected by a diverse infra-community of pathogens, and interactions between pathogens can both alter infection dynamics (Cattadori et al. 2008; Susi et al. 2015) and influence disease outcomes (Moss et al. 2008; Munson et al. 2008; Wejse et al. 2015) . Pathogens that form chronic, long-lasting infections are ubiquitous and are likely to overlap pathogens that produce short-lasting acute infections (Fenton 2008; Randall et al. 2013; Rynkiewicz et al. 2015; Aivelo & Norberg 2018) . Chronic pathogens can compete for the same resources as acute pathogens and can reduce the likelihood of infection (Randall et al. 2013; Budischak et al. 2018) or, conversely, facilitate infection via immune suppression (e.g., Geldmacher & Koup 2012) .",

This is particularly the case for microparasites where pathogen detection often relies on serology, and, thus, without resampling the same individual, the precise timing of exposure cannot be estimated. Detection of chronic pathogens may be more straightforward as the infection is active for more extended periods, but deducing pathogen interactions is difficult without extensive longitudinal data (Tompkins et al. 2011; Fenton et al. 2014) . Identifying whether two pathogens interact due to host-habitat preferences, the increasing likelihood of exposure with age, or infra-community processes such as competition is methodologically challenging (Poulin 2007; Johnson & Buller 2011; Fenton et al. 2014; Clark et al. 2016) .",

For example, individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1 (HIV-1) are four times more likely to become coinfected with tuberculosis compared to individuals with HIV-2 (Wejse et al. 2015) . Beyond subtype or genus, genotype-specific associations have been demonstrated in snails infected by trematodes (Louhi et al. 2015) and in rodents infected by Bartonella bacteria (Brook et al. 2017 ).",

In general, interactions between free-living species are more apparent at scales 7 7 Although pathogen co-occurrence networks are valuable for quantifying broad structural patterns, they do not account for environmental or host factors or differences in spatial or temporal scale. Joint species distribution models fill this gap by simultaneously assessing environmental influences and interspecific co-occurrences across multiple scales using hierarchical Bayesian mixed models (Warton et al. 2015; Ovaskainen et al. 2017 ). Here we use both co-occurrence network and joint species distribution models to examine the structure of pathogen-pathogen networks and quantify pathogen associations whilst controlling for environmental and host factors. We collate ten years of data on acute and chronic pathogens in 105 African lions (Panthera leo) as well as extensive host and environmental data from the Serengeti Lion Project (SLP, Packer et al. 2005) . The SLP datasets provides a unique opportunity to understand pathogen co-occurrence networks in a wild population whilst controlling for group, individual and environmental characteristics.

Pathogens which peak in prevalence at a young age (<= 2 y.o.) with little temporal fluctuation were considered to be chronic, whereas an increasing age-prevalence relationship and high temporal variation were classified as more acute (Fig. S1 ). Feline coronavirus can have both acute and chronic forms and it is impossible to assess which form the individual was exposed to from serological data, but based on age-prevalence relationships we categorized it as a chronic infection (Fig. S1 ). As most individual lions were likely to be infected by chronic infections within the first two years after birth (Troyer et al. 2011, Fig . S1), we assume that acute exposure typically occurred whilst the individual was infected by the chronic pathogen. We then partitioned the chronic pathogen data into two sets based on taxonomic resolution (high and medium). The high taxonomic resolution dataset encompassed FIV Ple genotype and Babesia species data, whereas the medium resolution dataset aggregated FIV Ple subtype information and Babesia data to genus level. We created a summary co-occurrence matrix (n*n) (Griffiths et al. 2014) that described the amount of co-occurrence of both chronic and acute pathogens within individuals by multiplying the incidence matrix (i.e., contingency table that described the occurrence of pathogens across individuals) by its transpose.

These can then be compared with knowledge of pathogen pathogenesis and validated in-vitro in a laboratory setting.

For example, the distribution of B. felis was not shaped by any other protozoan and in general, had a narrow association profile (Fig.2) , unlike the other Babesia species. For the individuals co-infected by protozoans, combinations involving B. felis were also common, whereas co-infections involving H. felis and the other Babesia species varied in prevalence and composition (Fig. S9) . Even though B. gibsoni and B. felis show similar age prevalence profiles (Fig. S1 ), the prevalence of B. felis over time was relatively stable compared to the other protozoa (Fig. S10) . Differences in the host range for individual Babesia species and potential host differences in virulence may partially explain these patterns. For example, B. felis has only ever been detected in felids, whereas B. gibsoni has a much broader host range including canids (Penzhorn 2006 ). More generalist pathogens may have greater pathogenicity as there can be reduced selective restraint on virulence particularly in 'dead end' hosts (Woolhouse et al. 2001 ). If more pathogenic species are more likely to form significant associations with other pathogens compared to less virulent",

The inability to distinguish mortality from competitive interactions is one of them, and careful interpretation of negative associations is necessary. Incorporating approaches such as structural equation models that explicitly include potential mechanisms that underly candidate pathogen interactions (Carver et al. 2015) could be a valuable additional step in future pathogen network studies. Another weakness is the inability to estimate the timing of these infections more precisely. For example, the negative association between RVF and H. felis could be due to differences in rainfall affecting vector abundance with higher rainfall years increase mosquito abundance thus increasing RVF prevalence (Fig. S2 ). In contrast, low rainfall years increase the risk of lions being exposed to ticks (Munson et al. 2008) thus potentially increasing H. felis prevalence. As rainfall was calibrated to the age of sampling rather than the age of infection (which could differ) the JSDM approach could not capture this variation. Furthermore, we cannot quantify the importance of these associations in shaping pathogen distribution across scales compared to processes such as host density. Also, the number of samples we had did differ across years (Table S1 ) with most coming between 1985 and 1994, and this have influenced some patterns, particularly between genotypes. Lastly, incorporating immune function and host resources in both the summary network and JSDM analyses are likely to provide mechanistic insight into pathogen network structure (Griffiths et al. 2014) . However, given the daunting complexity of pathogen infra-community dynamics, our two-step approach can assess broad network structure and identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity.",

The summary lion co-occurrence network is highly connected with both positive and negative associations between chronic and acute pathogens and altering the network could assist with disease control. For example, individuals vaccinated for both parvovirus and H. felis could potentially be at lower risk of Babesia and CDV infection. Conversely, our networks show that there could be unintended consequences of controlling a pathogen, as has been shown for deworming (Fenton 2013). For example, it is possible that vaccination targeting coronavirus in this population could increase B. gibsoni infections that may, in turn, lead to a higher risk of CDV exposure.

Measures of modularity aim to determine the adequacy of different classification schemes in representing clusters and divisions in datasets; here, the clusters represented the co-occurrence of pathogens in individual hosts. Estimates of modularity were calculated for each possible classification by comparing the expected fraction of co-occurrence of pathogens compared to the quantity if the co-occurrences happened randomly(Newman 2006). The classification with the highest modularity from all the generated classifications was selected. This analysis was performed using the igraph library in R(Cs\u00e1rdi & Nepusz 2006).",

However, this is not surprising as the human networks included host resources and immune system components as nodes, and we lacked data on bacteria, helminths, and fungi. These additional taxa may lead to further segregation in the network, as larger and more diverse networks typically show increased modularity and segregation(Thebault & Fontaine 2010;Sauve et al. 2014). Expanding sampling to construct a more complete microbe and macroparasite network would also capture a broader array of potentially facilitative and competitive interactions (Ezenwa 2016;Aivelo & Norberg 2018).",

HIV-1 and human coronaviruses (HCoV) share remarkably similar binding receptors (Chan et al. 2006) and some mild HCoV strains even considered a viable vaccine against HIV (Eriksson et al. 2006). This may explain the negative association we detected for FIV Ple B and coronavirus but does not explain the positive association between FIV Ple C and coronavirus we detected across scales. The mechanism driving FIV Ple subtype specific relationships with coronaviruses are unclear, and as coronaviruses infecting lions are also likely",
