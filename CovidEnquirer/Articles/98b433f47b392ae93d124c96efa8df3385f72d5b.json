Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CO-V-2), was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China has now rapidly spread over 50 countries. For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24 th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28 th , 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital. Methods. Two patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray TM Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections. Results. Through contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27 th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10 th of March. The results of FilmArray TM Respiratory Panel revealed 22 of the 41 non-COVID-19 patients were infected by particular pathogens.",

Of which, influenza A/B, human Metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common. 11 The lack of specificity for clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and chest radiographs of COVID-19, as demonstrated in this report and previous studies, 3, 4, 12 makes differential diagnosis of this disease from other viral respiratory infections difficult. Rapid detection tools of common respiratory virus and bacteria, such as FilmArray TM Panel used here, help clinicians to determine causative pathogens of pneumonia in patients who are suspected with COVID-19 but have negative rRT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2. One of the huge challenges for preventing and controlling of this pandemic-prone disease 13, 14 is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic or presented flu-like symptoms. 15, 16 Under this circumstances, quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients and the application of rapid detection tools for etiology confirmation is strongly recommended. The confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan belonged to two groups: international migration and locally transmitted. Both COVID-19 patients in this report had no travel history. Upon exposure to Taiwan No. 19 case patient during a family dinner, they were infected. There were two additional family clusters of infections and a cluster of 8 patients infected in a single hospital in Taiwan until 6 th March 2020. The reproductive number of COVID-19, ranged from 1.4 to 6.49, 17 was averagely higher than severe acute respiratory symptoms (SARS) in 2003, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. 18 Community spread of COVID-19 has occurred in several countries in different continents. China, Hong Kong, Macao, Korea, Italy, and Iran are reported epidemic areas. To prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to expand the exposure risk management to persons who have travel history to epidemic areas, sick or cluster contacts, and to patients who have pneumonia or ARDS without clear explanation.",

From the database of Taiwan's CDC (https://nidss.cdc.gov.tw/ch/), severe influenza infection, in February 2020, had 67 cases, which was a remarkable decrease from, in February 2019, 256 cases. Thiscould be due to the national reinforcement of infection control measures and immigration policy for coping with COVID-19 since the end of January to February 2020. In conclusion, seasonal respiratory pathogens are more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 in the non-endemic patients suspected with COVID-19. All the patients shared similar clinical features and laboratory data. The scope of quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients should be expanded. The application of rapid detection tools, such as FilmArray TM Respiratory Panel, is highly recommended for the determination of causative pathogens. The long duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the transmission in patients asymptomatic or with mild illness drastically increase the pandemic potential of COVID-19. Owing to the early wave of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Taiwan, our study was limited by the small number of cases for screening and included 2 COVID-19 patients with mild illness. Further studies of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis are warranted to illuminate the full spectrum of COVID-19 and the treatment strategy.",
