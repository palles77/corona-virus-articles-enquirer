            "text": "Commercial vaccines for in ovo vaccination have not yet been developed for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the major coronavirus in the poultry industry. Recombinant IBVs based on the Beaudette strain expressing the Beaudette spike protein (Beau-R) or that from the virulent M41 strain (BeauR-M41(S)) were assessed for their potential as prototype vaccines for application to 18-day-old embryos. Pathogenicity was assessed by observing the effect on hatchability, and/or the production of nasal discharge and/or the effects on ciliary activity in the trachea at various time points post hatch. In contrast to commercial IBV vaccines given in ovo, the Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) strains did not reduce hatchability or cause nasal discharge, and caused minimal damage to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea. The presence of the spike protein from a virulent virus did not increase the pathogenicity of the virus according to the criteria used. Assessment of the BeauR-M41(S) strain for efficacy showed that it protected up to 90% of chicks against challenge with virulent IB virus (M41) in a dose dependent manner. Further egg passage of the BeauR-M41(S) strain (BeauR-M41(S) EP10) did not increase its pathogenicity though it did improve its efficacy, based on serology and protection against a virulent challenge. BeauR-M41(S) EP10 was more efficacious than BeauR-M41(S) protecting more birds against virulent challenge and providing a better serological antibody response. BeauR-M41(S) EP10 induced a serological response similar to that of a commercial vaccine given at day-old though the commercial vaccine provided slightly higher efficacy. These results are promising for the development of embryo safe efficacious IBV vaccines for in ovo application.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is one of the primary causes of respiratory disease in domestic fowl. IBVs primarily and initially infect the trachea though they can also infect the kidney and oviduct and other epithelial surfaces. Infection with IBV reduces the performance of broilers and in laying birds drops in egg production and egg quality can occur. Live-attenuated vaccines against infectious bronchitis are generally given to chicks at 1 day of age in the hatch-ery by spray, or later in the field by either drinking water or spray. However, as with any live-attenuated vaccine administered via the respiratory tract, which must replicate in order to be effective, vaccination at an early age can damage the epithelial lining of the trachea and depending on the extent of this damage, secondary bacterial infections can occur. For this reason it is important to assess post vaccinal reactions when preparing vaccine strains.",

            "text": "Vaccination in ovo against Marek's disease and infectious bursal disease is commonplace in the USA [1] . In ovo delivery gives the advantage that all vaccinations can be done prior to hatching as long as the vaccines are shown to be compatible and safe. Whilst considerable work has been done on in ovo delivery of Marek and infectious bursal disease vaccines, little work has been done on delivering IBV vaccines in ovo. This is due to the fact that most strains of IBV are embryo lethal, both in the 9-12-day-old embryos that are used for producing IB vaccines, and in 18-day-old embryos. One group has shown that in ovo vaccination with IBV can be successfully accomplished, although the strain used had residual pathogenicity even at low titres [2] . As uniform mass application of IBV vaccines post hatch can be problematic with regard to obtaining even distribution of spray or ensuring all birds receive the correct dosage from drinking water, delivering IBV in ovo, via which a precise dosage can be achieved, could bring significant advantages to the poultry industry.",

Previous work has demonstrated that using a reverse genetics approach, the efficacy of the Beaudette strain can be improved by substituting the Beaudette spike protein with the spike protein from the virulent M41 strain, also of the Massachusetts serotype [4] . Interestingly, although this altered the cell tropism of the virus [5] , the pathogenicity was not altered. This strain was able to afford significant protection to vaccinated birds against challenge with a virulent M41 strain. The aim of this work was to determine whether Beaudette strain-based IBVs produced by reverse genetics could be used as in ovo vaccines. Therefore the safety and efficacy of these strains were investigated.",

Surprisingly, even at high doses, the Beaudette based strains tested did not significantly affect the ability of the chick to hatch (Fig. 1A-D) or cause clinical signs post hatch ( Fig. 2A and Experiment 3, data not shown) when compared to vaccination with a placebo. This is in contrast to work of Wakenell and Sharma [2] whose IBV in ovo vaccine candidate showed residual pathogenicity at a dose of 500 pfu. As expected the embryo adapted commercial vaccines greatly reduced hatchability ( Fig. 1A and D) and gave clinical signs post hatch ( Fig. 2A) . The reason why the recombinant Beaudette strains are safe for in ovo vaccination is unknown though could be associated with the passage history of these particular strains. The parent Beaudette virus has been passaged on embryos more than the commercial vaccines and also passaged on CK cells, the precise passage history being unknown. Subsequently the recombinant viruses have been passaged further on CK cells. In line with the results of Hodgson et al. [4] , with hatched chicks, we found that that the substitution of the Beaudette spike protein with that of the virulent M41 strain did not increase the pathogenicity of the BeauR-M41(S) strain over Beau-R in 18-day-old embryos or post hatch. This result suggests that the ability of M41-CK virus to reduce hatchability (to 58% in comparison to 89% with the placebo in Experiment 5) is not associated with the spike protein but may be associated with differences in other genes. It is interesting to note that further egg passages of the BeauR-M41(S) strain did not increase pathogenicity based on hatching criteria.",

The Beaudette-based vaccine strains caused tracheal ciliostasis following in ovo inoculation but at an acceptable level with respect to vaccine safety [9] . This indicates that the Beaudette strains were able to replicate in the trachea of the in ovovaccinated chicks. In contrast, virtually no tracheal ciliostasis was caused by the Beaudette strains following inoculation of chicks by the oculonasal route [4] , although Beaudette does cause ciliostasis when inoculated onto tracheal organ cultures. This suggests that delivery of IBV in ovo enables it to grow better in the trachea than post hatch delivery possibly due to the embryos ingesting amniotic fluid containing the viral inoculum, introducing the virus directly to the trachea. In contrast the commercial vaccine tested caused very high ciliostasis scores post hatch after delivery in ovo (Fig. 2B) . This is in contrast to the results for the commercial vaccine delivered at day-old by nose and eye-drop appli-cation (Fig. 2C) , again suggesting that delivery of IBV in ovo enables it to grow better in the trachea than delivery at day-old.",

In contrast in a single experiment (Fig. 2C, 10 4 EID 50 ) the egg-passaged BeauR-M41(S) EP10 virus gave higher, but not significantly higher, ciliostasis scores.

No significant differences were seen in the serological responses induced by Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) in two experiments ( Fig. 3A and B) and it is of interest to note that there was no dose dependency regarding the serological response or rate of seroconversion, a 100-fold more virus giving a similar response and seroconversion rate (Fig. 3A versus B) . However, eggpassaged BeauR-M41(S) EP10 induced significantly higher responses than BeauR-M41(S) (Fig. 3B and C) . This response was not significantly different to that induced by a commercial vaccine given at day-old (Fig. 3B) indicating a high level of immunogenicity of this virus. The reasons for the difference in immunogenicity of the egg-passaged virus requires further investigation though one could speculate that as the virus may have replicated more in the trachea, it subsequently induced a better immune response.",

A high dose (10 6 EID 50 ) of BeauR-M41(S) induced levels of protection comparable to that induced by the commercial vaccine given in ovo (Fig. 4A) , though the commercial vaccine was not safe as determined by the criteria described above. The level of protection (90%) resulting from in ovo vaccination with BeauR-M41(S) was higher than that induced by Beau-R (30%), suggesting a positive effect of the M41 spike protein. As these viruses appeared to grow equally well in the trachea ( Fig. 2B and C) it can be speculated that the increase in protection observed with the BeauR-M41(S) was due to the M41 spike protein which is homologous to the spike protein of the challenge virus. Alternatively, as a cytotoxic T cell response is thought to be important in protection against IB challenge [10] it is possible that the 5% amino acid difference between Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) spike proteins [4] contain relevant CTL epitopes for protection against M41 challenge. The results presented herein are in agreement with the finding that vaccination with BeauR-M41(S) given at 8-days-old gave higher protection against virulent M41 challenge than vaccination with Beau-R [4] .",

Expression of the M41 spike protein, rather than the Beaudette spike protein, and further egg passage of the virus expressing the M41 spike protein improved the efficacy of the virus. To confirm the potential use of these candidate vaccines in the field, future work will concentrate on the effect of maternally derived antibody on the efficacy of these viruses as vaccine candidates following in ovo vaccination.",
