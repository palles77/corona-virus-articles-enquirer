Viruses have been demonstrated to be associated with asthma epidemiologically in at least two ways (Fig.  1) . First, during infancy, certain viruses have been implicated as potentially being responsible for the inception of the asthmatic phenotype. Second, in patients, particularly children, with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections play a significant role in producing acute exacerbations of airway obstruction that may result in frequent outpatient visits or hospitalization^.^^, [55] [56] [57] This article reviews these two areas by focusing first on mechanisms by which virus infections may lead to the development of asthma in infants and children and, second, on mechanisms by which virus infections may produce acute asthmatic symptoms in patients who already have established disease.",

Children aged 3 to 6 months are most prone to develop lower respiratory tract symptoms, suggesting that a developmental component (e.g., lung or immunologic maturation) may be involved as 83 The relationship between RSV infections during the first few years of life and the subsequent development of the asthmatic phenotype has been the subject of much interest as well as controversy. Variations in reporting longitudinal outcomes (e.g., recurrent wheezing, measurements of airway hyperresponsiveness, diagnosis of asthma) appear to be influenced mostly by the criteria used to define \"bronchiolitis.\" These criteria include the type of virus producing the symptoms (in addition to RSV, viruses that may contribute to the development of bronchiolitis in this age group could be PIV, coronavirus, influenzavirus, and rhin~virus~~); the age at the time of infection; the nature and severity of symptoms required for inclusion; and, finally, the characteristics of both the study population (community versus hospital-based) and the study design (retrospective versus prospective). A number of long-term prospective studies of children admitted to a hospital with documented RSV-induced bronchiolitis have shown that about 75% experience wheezing in the first 2 years after the initial illness, more than 50% still wheeze 3 years later, and approximately 40% continue to wheeze after 5 years?,, 49, 733 91, 117, Additional insight into these areas recently was provided by the results of an ll-year prospective study involving 880 children who were enrolled at birth, followed for the development of lower respiratory tract illnesses (LRIs) in the first 3 years of life, and then evaluated for the presence or absence of physician-diagnosed asthma or a history of current wheezing at ages 6 and 11 years.14 Most importantly, lung function was evaluated in the first few months of life in a subset of these children prior to the development of a documented LRI. During the first 3 years of life, 7.4% had pneumonia documented radio-graphically and 44.7% had a significant LRI without pneumonia. Respiratory syncytial virus and PIV were identified in 36.4% and 7.3%, respectively, in the subjects with pneumonia, and in 35.6% and 15.2%, respectively, of the subjects with a LRI. At age 6, physiciandiagnosed asthma was present in 13.6% (OR = 3.3), 10.2% (OR = 2.4), and 4.6% of the subjects with pneumonia, LRI, and no LRI, respectively. By age 11, these values increased to 25.9% (OR = 2.8), 16.1% (OR = 1.6), and 11%, respectively. Mean maximum volume at functional residual capacity values before any LRI were lower in children with pneumonia and with LRIs than in children with no LRIs. These values continued to be lower at age 6 and by age 11, when forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEVl) and FEF, , were recorded, similar group relationships persisted. Interestingly, despite the persistence of lowered baseline lung function in both the pneumonia and LRI groups, many of these deficits were markedly (but not completely) reduced following administration of albuterol.",

Following passive transfer of these cell lines to naive recipients and subsequent intranasal inoculation with RSV mice receiving G-specific cells have more severe illnesses, characterized by lung hemorrhage, pulmonary neutrophil recruitment, and intense pulmonary eosinophi1ia.l These experiments are of interest based on the adverse clinical response noted in many infants who received a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine and subsequently became infected with RSV?",

In addition to serving as host cells, it is now well documented that epithelial cells also initiate the immune response to infections through the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. In vitro studies of epithelial cells or cell lines have demonstrated that respiratory viruses such as RV, RSV, and parainfluenzavirus can induce the secretion of many different proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-a, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-11) and chemokines (RANTES, IL-8, MIP-la).lo, 20, 23, 96, 98, lo5 Epithelial-derived chemokines are likely to be an important signal in initiating antiviral responses through the recruitment of leukocytes to the airway. In support of this concept, IL-8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, is found in high levels in nasal secretions of children with virus-induced asthma, and levels of IL-8 correlate with the number of airway neutrophils and neutrophil myeloperoxidase levels (suggesting neutrophil activation).lo8 There is also evidence, however, that enhanced airway inflammation caused by chemokine secretion may also disturb normal air-way physiology. Chemokine levels in nasal secretions correlate closely with cold symptoms,\"O for example, and IL-8 levels correlate with virus-induced changes in airway respon-~i v e n e s s .~~ Levels of epithelial-derived cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-11 also correlate with respiratory syrnpt0ms,2~ and animal studies indicate that overexpression of IL-11 can cause bronchial hyperresponsi~eness.~~~ Io7",

Evidence for this comes from experiments in mice, in which most of the T cells found in the lung after an acute viral infection are not virus-specific,2l and in vitro studies, in which 25% to 50% of human peripheral blood T cells express the early activation marker CD69 after 24 hours in culture with RV.36 RANTES, induced by respiratory viruses, at high concentrations can also induce antigen-independent T-cell activation? These studies suggest that respiratory viruses can induce early, nonspecific T-cell activation and recruitment that could significantly increase the intensity of airway inflammation, resulting in airway dysfunction and respiratory symptoms. This hypothesis is supported by studies of volunteers infected with rhinovirus. Respiratory virus infections usually cause peripheral lymphopenia and increased numbers of lymphocytes in the upper and lower airways, for example. The degree of peripheral blood lymphopenia and lymphocytic infiltration of the airway epithelium has been correlated with the increases in airway responsi~eness.~~~ 26",

First, there is increasing evidence that severe infections with RSV and PIV in infancy can alter lung development and physiology to increase the risks of subsequent wheezing and asthma. Second, infections with common cold viruses and influenza commonly precipitate wheezing symptoms in children and adults who already have established asthma, and RV appears to be the most important virus in producing exacerbations of the disease. The principal mechanisms by which this occurs appears to be viral replication in epithelial cells, triggering a cascade of inflammation involving granulocytes, macrophages, T cells, and secreted cytokines and mediators. The inflammatory process, although essential to clear the infection, augments pre-existing airway inflammation in asthma, leading to increased airway obstruction and lower respiratory tract symptoms. Greater understanding of virus-induced changes in inflammation and corresponding changes in airway physiology may lead to new therapeutic approaches to the treatment and prevention of virus-induced airway dysfunction.
