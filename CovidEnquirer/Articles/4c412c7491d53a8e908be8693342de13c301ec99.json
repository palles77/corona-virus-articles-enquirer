The myelinating cells found one day after birth contained a large amount of evenly distributed ribosomes up to the outer tongue of mesaxons, representing the cytoplasmic density. These cells were separated by astrocytic processes from the pial basement membrane, even when they were located on the pial surface. Astrocytes contained glial fibiils from one day onwards and often attached their processes to the pial basement membrane. Although the cytoplasmic processes of astrocytes occasionally wrapped axons, they were never shown to form the initial layer of myelin sheaths. However, the tenuous processes of the sub-pial astrocytes were occasionally rolled in myelin lamellae, as if a part of the myelin sheaths was constructed by astrocytic processes. The interpretation for this finding is discussed in relation to function and potency of the astrocytes, and variations and anomalies of nervous ontogeny.",

Kozik 1976) and in the spinal cord of rats (Matthews and Duncan 1971 ; Knobler et al. 1974 Knobler et al. , 1976 . Light-and electron-microscopic studies have demonstrated that oligodendrocytes are involved in myelinogenesis in the normal central nervous system (see review of Bunge 1968) , although in the past a concept was proposed that myelin is constructed as a patchwork assembly of many different glial processes (Luse 1956; Ross et al. 1962) . This viewpoint was supported by Narang (1977) , who suggested in his study of the rabbit optic nerve that astrocytes also myelinate axons. Moreover, in an investigation of virus-induced demyelination in rats it was shown that astrocytes as well as oligodendrocytes undergo morphological changes prior to demyelination, suggesting an interrelationship of myelin with these two cell classes (Nagashima et al. 1978) . This observation, together with Narang's findings led to the present examination of the relationship between glial cells and myelin sheaths in the developmental stage in relation to the role of astrocytes in myelination in areas other than optic nerve. As a site of myelinogenesis the anterior funiculus of the spinal cervical cord of rats was chosen since it was found to be the preferred area of corona virus-induced demyelination in our animal model.",

The perfusate consisted of 2.0 ~ glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution pH 7.4 at room temperature. After perfusion the spines with spinal cord were dissected and they were cut horizontally through intervertebral discs. The divided blocks of the spinal cords which correspond to the 2nd and 4th cervical vertebral bodies were fixed overnight in the same fixative as the perfusate. After fixation the spinal cords were removed carefully from the spines and sliced horizontally into 1-mm thick sections. The sections were post-fixed in 1 ~ osmic acid, stained en bloc with 2 ~ uranyl acetate in 0.1 M sodium hydrogen maleate buffer (Karnowsky 1967) , dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. Sections were prepared from the horizontally cut surfaces. Semi-thin sections were stained with 1 ~ toluidine blue. The ultra-thin sections from the selected areas were stained with lead citrate and examined with a Zeiss 10 B electron microscope.",

            "text": "Other cells which were contiguous with the pial basement membrane exhibited glial fibrils, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, vesicles and free ribosomes even in a lday-old rat (Fig. 4) . These cells were considered astrocytes and their ribosomes were not as homogeneously distributed as found in the myelinating cells. This low density of the cytoplasm could be traced to the tip of the cytoplasmic processes (Fig. 4) . The cytoplasmic processes of the astrocytes often wrapped the naked axons (Figs. 3 and 4) . In these wrappings the processes neither fused their inner aspect to form a major dense line, nor revealed the coalescence between their outer and inner layers forming an intraperiod line as shown in the initial myelinating layer of axon (A2) of Fig. 4 . Moreover, the cytoplasmic processes enfolding axons contained very few ribosomes or vesicles, differentiating them from those of the myelinating cytoplasmic processes. The astrocytic processes also contained, besides glial fibrils, a large number of microtubules. The presence of microtubules was confirmed up to the 21 st day, although the number decreased with age of the animals. The most interesting phenomenon was the enrolment of astrocytic processes by myelin lamellae (Figs. 5 and 6 ). This phenomenon was occasionally observed in the sub-pial astrocytes. The tenuous astrocytic processes trapped in the lamellae did not obviously fuse or coalesce their cytoplasmic membrane to form the myelin lamellae. In Fig. 5b an attenuated astrocytic process could be traced clockwise through one and a half turns inside the lamellae with the same direction as the inner tip of the mesaxon and this process was seen to be overlapped by the counter-clockwise rotation of the outer tongue. In Fig. 6c , a penetrating astrocytic process was covered by one half turn of a major dense line which is continuous with the outer tongue of the mesaxon. These findings were observed until the rats became 5 days old; thereafter they were difficult to detect, probably because of the complexity of the developing central nervous system and the consequent difficulties in interpretation. Fig. 4 . A sub-pial astrocyte of a l-day-old rat. The cytoplasm of astrocyte faces the pial basement membrane (left side, ~). On the opposite side, it contains various organelles. The cytoplasmic density is not homogeneous, compared to those of the myelinating cells. In this field, two axons are wrapped (A1) or ensheathed (A2) by cytoplasmic processes containing evenly distributed electron-dense granules. Around an axon A2, an intraperiod line produced by the interconnection of the inner and outer ruesaxons can be seen. While an astrocytic process wrapping itself aroung an axon (A3) shows less electron density and forms neither major dense line, nor intraperlo, line.

In their study of cat optic nerves, astrocytes in the lamina cribrosa were thought to be responsible for the formation of the fine myelin sheaths, since no oligodendroglia are located in this region. They regarded the astrocytic wrappings around axons as the initial ensheathment. However, Vaughn (1969) in a reevaluation of these studies came to the conclusion that astrocytes are probably not involved in the early stage of myelination. His interpretations were based on the following findings: the observed wrappings extended only short distances along the length of the enclosed axons, typical mesaxons were never detected in such wrappings (Vaughn and Peters 1967 ) and a time difference was seen between the occurrence of wrappings and the initial myelin sheaths. He concluded that the occasional wrapping of unmyelinated axons by astrocytic processes would seem to be a random event associated with the outgrowth of astrocytic processes forming astroglial sheets rather than with the production of myelin sheaths. In the present study, tl~e initial layer of ensheathment was not observed in such wrappings. Moreover, the cytoplasmic density in tips of wrappings was lighter than those of myelinating processes. Therefore, in agreement with Vaughn's conclusion, astrocytic wrappings were not considered the initial ensheathment.",

Astrocytic processes were actually trapped in the myelin lamellae, as if a part of the myelin sheaths were constructed by astrocytic processes (Fig. 5 ). There has been no reported demonstration that astrocytic processes were rolled in myelin lamellae. Luse (1956) in her study of mouse and rat brains and spinal cords suggested that many glial cell processes may be involved in myelin formation rather than a single cell and its processes. One could argue about the trapped process developing into a myelin component, because the direction of the astrocytic spiral is contrary to that of the outer tongue of the lamellae. Knobler et al. (1976) in their analysis of serial electron micrographs of the lumbar spinal cord white matter of 5-day-old rats showed that the direction of early ensheathment spirals was often bidirectional. The same finding can be seen in Figs. 5b and 6c. The spiral direction of the inner tongue and astrocytic processes are clockwise, while that of the outer tongue is counter-clockwise.",

In the prenatal neuroglial development, the subpial glial cells or glioblasts are produced from matric cells by their migration to the periphery of the spinal cord and their tlansformation (Fujita 1965) . These glioblasts mature into oligodendroglia and astrocytes, as development proceeds. And in neonatal and early post-natal ages, glial cells divide and proliferate actively (Sakla 1965; Gilmore 1971) .

This idea is based on the hypothesis that one of the astrocytic functions during development is to guide some neurons during their outward migrations from the germinal zone to their final resting positions (Jacobson 1978) . Reier and Webster (1974) suggested in their studies of tadpole optic nerve remyelination that astrocytic processes guide oligodendrocytic processes as they extend to surround axons.",
