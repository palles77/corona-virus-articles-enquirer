This paper evaluates energy and CO 2 emissions performance using a newly developed non-radial directional distance function, and China's regional integration is investigated using a price approach. The study points to evidence that: (1) most provinces do not perform efficiently in terms of energy use and CO 2 emissions with performance gaps among regions becoming larger, indicating regional segmentation; (2) magnitude of regional integration has increased dramatically, while China's eastern provinces are less integrated in domestic side due to their convenience to international openness; (3) regional integration has significant and robust positive effects on energy and CO 2 emissions performance with over 70% of effects coming from artificial barriers, rather than geographical distance; (4) international openness is also beneficial for promoting energy and CO 2 emissions performance, but cannot substitute for regional integration because of China's specialization in energy-intensive manufacturing in the global economy. Based on the empirical findings, we suggest that central government should continue to encourage regional integration given that local governments have incentives to fragment because it is a way of promoting energy and CO 2 emissions performance and stimulating economy at the same time.",

            "text": "There are two stylized facts in China's economic research. The first is the low energy and CO 2 emissions performance. China has overtaken US as the biggest energy consumer and CO 2 emitter in the world. The primary energy consumption of China was over 2800 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2013 while CO 2 emissions were over 9.5 billion tonnes. The corresponding figures for the US were 2266 Mtoe for primary energy and 5.9 billion tonnes for CO 2 emissions. Meanwhile, China's gross domestic product (GDP) was only 55.8% of US in 2013. The over-consumption of energy and related CO 2 emissions due to low energy efficiency and carbon efficiency are big challenges for China's sustainable development, especially in the process of industrialization and urbanization (Zhu et al., 2015a) . Fig. 1 displays the historical trends of China's energy intensity and carbon intensity in comparison with European Union (EU), US, Japan, India and world average. Here, energy intensity and carbon intensity are defined as energy consumption and CO 2 emissions per unit of GDP (Lin and Li, 2014) . Although China's energy intensity and carbon intensity are both declined dramatically in near decades, they are still quite large according to international comparison, even about 60% larger than those in India. Previous studies, such as Fan et al. (2007) , Lin and Ouyang (2014) , Zhu et al. (2015b) , also particularly pointed out China's large energy and carbon intensity. It is therefore urgent for China to improve energy and CO 2 emissions performance for reducing energy consumption and mitigating CO 2 emissions.",

After implementing economic reform in 1978, China has gradually become an extroverted economy through international openness, but on the domestic side, market integration has been impeded. Similar to the prisoner's dilemma in game theory, beggar-thy-neighbour policies are quite common in each province because local governments have a clear incentive to keep their production of scarce raw materials to themselves or to prevent the inflow of goods produced in other provinces. It is worth noting that although there is widespread local protectionism, the magnitude of market segmentation is declining and China's regional markets are becoming more and more integrated.",

Many studies have attempted to investigate energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions efficiency in China's regions and industries (see, Hu and Wang (2006) and Lin and Yang (2014) ). However, the literature usually measures energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions efficiency separately. One of the most recent contributions to the evaluation of energy and carbon efficiency is Zhang et al. (2014) , which propose two non-radical directional distance functions (NDDF) for conducting both energy and CO 2 efficiency analysis simultaneously in a single model. Lin and Du (2015) apply this method for evaluating China's regional energy and CO 2 emissions performance. They find that China's efficiencies in energy use and CO 2 emissions are still at the low stage in most regions.",

First, economic unification encourages the competition among provinces, and thus enterprises have more incentives to invest in research and development (R & D) on energy efficiency. Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) develop a monopolistically competitive model to show that market size affects the toughness of competition. Grossman and Helpman (2015) also stress the importance of competition in a large scale. Second, regional integration could achieve scale economy which has been stressed by previous literature as a source of productivity growth (Tybout and Westbrook, 1995; Tybout, 2000; Biesebroeck, 2005) . Third, the diffu-sion of technological progress and managerial experience is limited by regional barriers (C\u00f3rdova and Moreira, 2003; Peluffo, 2013 ), while regional integration could promote performance by eliminating the barriers. Lastly, regional integration encourages specialization according to comparative advantage (Grossman and Helpman, 2015) , which has been regarded as the main source of productivity growth since Adams Smith. Due to the severe of resource depletion and global warming, the productivity incorporating energy input and CO 2 emissions has become more and more important (Chen and Golley, 2014) . To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature on the effect of regional integration on energy and CO 2 emissions performance.",

The two are applied to estimate the effects of regional integration on energy and CO 2 emissions performance to check the robustness of our results. 3 To investigate the second issue, two works have been conducted: (1) we use the price approach proposed by Parsley and Wei (2001a) to construct the panel data of regional integration of provinces because price convergence is the most common indicator of market integration (Xu, 2002) . (2) Local protectionism has been particularly identified by filtering the underlying effects of geography. In a country as large as 2 The definition of the unified efficiency and energy-environmental performance are shown in Section 3. 3 The weight vector used in calculating the energy and CO 2 emissions performance might influence the results even conclusions.

Local protectionism might be the first reason because under the stress of mutual GDP championship, local governments tend to prevent the outflow of scarce raw factor materials to other provinces and the inflow of goods produced in other provinces. Beggar-thy-neighbour policies in each province even exaggerate local protectionism. The second reason might be rent seeking. During the planning economy period, central government distorted factor and the product pricing system in order to ensure the surviving of heavy industry. Especially, related enterprises were mainly state-owned. Price setting and state-owned enterprise (SOE) indicate that the corresponding departments have the potential for rent seeking. It is widely accepted that SOE is relatively inefficient (Song et al., 2011) and thus it needs to be protected from competition from other provinces to ensure the rents of local governments (Liu, 2012) . Local governments are thus motivated to set up artificial barriers, it is harmful to domestic regional integration of Chinese provinces.",

(2010) reveal, most of Chinese provinces prefer to implement market segmentation. Although market segmentation leads to local enterprises unable to take advantage of domestic market, it can be achieved through stimulating export expansion of local enterprises, relying on international markets to obtain scale economies and technological spillover (Grossman and Helpman, 2015) .

(2016) . However, it is also need to point out that weak disposability assumption is critical recently because weak disposability only conceptually meets economic requirements on production, but has no sufficiently specified mathematical formulation to measure the concept of disposability (Sueyoshi and Goto, 2012) . Alternatively, natural disposability and managerial disposability have been proposed by Sueyoshi and Goto (2012 , 2013 . We thank a reviewer for pointing out this issue. The idea of weak disposability is to introduce the notion of costly rather than free disposal of the desirable output (F\u00e4re et al., 2005; Du et al., 2016) . With existing technology, this assumption is appropriate for China's CO 2 emissions due to difficulty in CO 2 mitigation for given outputs and inputs, especially considering that China is currently in its industrialization and urbanization process (Lin and Li, 2014) . Thus, it is reasonable to specify weak disposability in this paper.",

In addition, this method allows for incorporating the price information of various goods and obtaining a comprehensive indicator for regional integration. In the entire process of measuring Chinese regional integration depicted by Eqs. (7)-(11), there is no regression, but obtaining panel dataset by calculation.

On the other hand, international openness might promote China's energy consumption and CO 2 emissions because of China's exporting for energy and carbon-intensive products (Wang and Watson, 2008) . Foreign investments also usually focus on energy and carbon-intensive industries, such as chemical industry (Al-mulali and Tang, 2013; Lin and Sun, 2016) . In this sense, international openness might also have adverse effect, which is usually termed as \"pollution haven\" or \"pollution refuge\". In general, there are two measures for international openness. The first measure is trade openness, and the second is foreign direct investment (FDI). Either of them might only include one aspect of international openness (Mao and Sheng, 2011) . We conduct a principle components analysis (PCA) to summarize the information underlying foreign trade and FDI into a single indicator for international openness. Following Du et al. (2012) , we use the sum of import and export as a share of nominal GDP to present trade openness, and the share of FDI in GDP as proxy of FDI.",

            "text": "(2) Ownership (OWN). According to the existing studies on privatization, the extent of ownership reform might affect efficiency (Song et al., 2011) . We use the share of state-owned enterprise output in the gross output to measure the ownership in each province. (3) Environmental regulation (REGU). On one hand, according to the Porter hypothesis proposed by Porter and Van der Linde (1995), environmental regulation could encourage innovations and thus help improve efficiency. On the other hand, several studies suggest that the diversion of resources to the required abatement of environmental regulation would increase the cost of production and lesser resources could be used for R & D. From this point, it might be harmful for energy and CO 2 emissions performance improvement. Hence, environmental regulation affects energy and CO 2 emissions performance in two opposing sides and the net effect is ambiguous. Similar to Lanoie et al. (2008) , we use the ratio of investment in pollution-control to the GDP to measure the magnitude of environmental regulation. (4) Energy price (PRICE). Generally speaking, higher energy price would induce energy consumers to decrease energy consumption and thus reduce CO 2 emissions. Due to the diversified energy resource endowments of each region and the administrative control of the Chinese government, there is substantial difference in energy price across provinces. It is thus necessary to capture the provincial heterogeneity of energy price. Data on provincial energy price for each year are not available, following Lin and Du (2015), we use the fuel price index converted to 2000 constant price as the proxy of energy price. (5) Human capital (HMCA). Numerous studies have shown that human capital plays a key role in productivity improvement (see such as, Hall and Jones, 1999; Bowlus and Robinson, 2012) . Similarly, the innovation and adoption of new technology for enhancing energy and CO 2 emissions performance also depends on human capital. Referring to Hall and Jones (1999) , human capital is given by e \u03d5 S ( ) i t , , where S i t , is the average years of schooling (education) of province i in year t, and \u03d5 S ( ) reflects the efficiency of a worker with S years of schooling relative to the one with no schooling (\u03d5 (0) = 0). The derivative \u03d5 S ( )\u2032 is the return to schooling which is obtained from the estimation in Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004) . (6) Fiscal expenditure (FISCAL). Government is an important partici-pant in the economy. Government spending on education and infrastructure is beneficial for energy and CO 2 emissions performance through technological progress, while the spending on political administration and military might have adverse effects because it would crowd out private expenditure (which might be invested in R & D) and lead to the distortions of resource allocation. We use the percentage of government spending in GDP to proxy the level of fiscal expenditure.",

This is consistent with the stylized fact that high energy consuming and high emitting industries in China has gradually transferred from east and central to the western region. Fig. 3 depicts the historical trends of UEI and ECPI of the national average and the three regions (east, central and west) grouped by geographical distance. Beside the dramatic improvement in both UEI and ECPI which is similar to Table 1, we also note that the performance gaps among the three regions are becoming larger. A possible interpretation for the divergence might be the effects of regional segmentation on energy and CO 2 emissions performance, because intuitively the performance across regions with sufficient market integration should be convergent due to the diffusion of technology and managerial experience. To better examine the effects of regional integration on UEI and ECPI, we first construct the panel dataset of regional integration, and then formally investigate its effects on UEI and ECPI in the following sections.",

A possible reason might be the central government's strive for prohibiting local protectionism (Poncet, 2005) . It could be proved by a directive issued in 2001 by China's State Council in which regional blockades in market activities are regarded as outlawed. 6 Second, the magnitude of regional integration declined dramatically in 1997, 2003-2004 and 2008 , during the periods of Asian financial crisis (1997), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) (2003) (2004) , and global financial crisis (2008). During the financial crisis of 1997 and 2008, local governments usually tend to protect local markets using artificial barriers, and in the period of the SARS, Chinese government sharply limited the flow of people and used quarantine measures to control the contagion of disease, thus regions are fragmented. Third, compared to central and western provinces, provinces in the east are less integrated. The reason for this phenomenon is that provinces located in eastern areas usually place more emphasis on international trade; while on the domestic side, interprovincial trade is only considered as residual. For province located in the interior, i.e., central and west, more emphasis is placed on interprovincial trade due to their geographical restriction to international trade or policy restriction to FDI. 7 Thus, the domestic regional integration in the central and western regions is more sufficient. Fig. 5 demonstrates the kernel density evolution paths of 7 An interesting characteristic of China's reform, which is usually named as incrementalism, is that they often start reform with experimentation at the local level, and gradually introduced to the entire nation if the local experiment is succeed. Special economic zones (SEZs) located in the east are the main areas that experiment for international openness, which have authorized less restrictions on international trade and attracting FDI. An interesting and detailed discussion on China's gradual transition could be seen in Brandt and Rawski (2008) .",

(i) In all models, the coefficients of fiscal expenditure is negative which imply that government spending would lead to the distortions of resource allocation and thus reduce energy and CO 2 emissions performance. (ii) The share of SOE has positive effects on energy and CO 2 emissions performance. Usually, privatization is considered to enhance efficiency improvement because private sector has more incentives to improve efficiency due to competition. But for energy and CO 2 emissions performance, it might not be the case. Facing the government's requirement of energy conservation and CO 2 mitigation, political pressure makes state-owned enterprise to have more incentive to achieve the requirement. (iii) The effects of fuel price on energy and CO 2 emissions performance are ambiguous and statistically insignificant. This might be indicative of the administrative control on energy prices (Lin and Li, 2014) . This is because compared with the product markets, factor markets in China are still distorted and the prices of energy are controlled even decided by the Chinese government. (iv) The coefficients of environmental regulation are significantly negative. As discussed above, environmental regulation has two opposing effects. The results imply that its net effect contributes to more energy use and CO 2 emissions because the diversion of resources to the required abatement might reduce the resources that could be used for R & D. (v) Human capital promotes energy and CO 2 emissions performance which is consistent with our expectations.",

It further supports our results that China's energy and CO 2 emissions performance benefits from regional integration.

Reverse causality means that the improvement in efficiency might in turn encourage regional integration. In general, energy and environment efficiency is also a kind of competitiveness, provinces that perform more efficiently in energy use and CO 2 emissions might have fewer incentives to implement regional segmentation because they might be more competitive than other provinces and thus domestic openness would not substantially threaten their internal markets. We propose the instrumental variable method to address the issue of reverse causality. Similar to Lin and Du (2015) , the lag terms of regional integration are employed as the instrumental variables. The intuition underlying this strategy is similar to the idea of General Moment Method (GMM) for dynamic panel model. The results as shown in Table 7 using instrumental variable method are also similar to those in Table 4 which further support the robustness.",

As noted above, the eastern provinces have even more incentives for regional segmentation on the domestic side because they can turn to international markets to export their products and attract FDI.

Thus more attention should be paid to eastern provinces to promote regional integration.",
