Usually, the down and contour feathers are affected first, whereas the primary feathers are affected later.

The DNA probe tests that are available at the University of Georgia Infectious Disease Laboratory can distinguish between PBFD and Psittacine Circovirus 2 (PsCV-2) of lories [15] . The PBFD DNA probe tests are performed on whole blood and detect viral DNA; a positive means that there was PBFD viral DNA in the blood. In a bird that has no clinical signs, it is recommended to retest the bird in 90 days to determine if the viral DNA is still present. If it is still present then the bird is infected, but if not, then the bird may have been infected transiently and overcame the infection. Any bird that displays feather abnormalities should have a feather follicle biopsy and DNA in situ hybridization performed in addition to the DNA probe blood test because some clinical birds are so viremic that they will have a negative blood test. This also can occur if a bird is extremely leukopenic [4] . A DNA probe test can be used to detect viral DNA on a swab of the environment to assist in determining the effectiveness of disinfection efforts. Treatment consists of supportive care and antimicrobials for secondary infections.",

Definitive diagnosis is based on histology. Treatment involves removing the wartlike growth. In the author's experience, it is best to apply silver nitrate to the lesion-or half of the lesion if it circumferentially involves the cloaca-every week under anesthesia until gone. Butorphanol also is administered at 2 mg/ kg, intramuscularly, one time before the procedure. The lesions can recur with stress.",

There are two influenza A subtypes based on surface proteins, ''H'' for hemagglutinin and ''N'' for neuraminidase. There are 15 known H subtypes and 9 known N subtypes. All subtypes are found in birds, but only H1, H2, H3, N1, and N2 are found commonly in humans. All avian virulent strains to date have been H5 or H7 subtype, but most H5 or H7 isolates have been of low virulence. For example, an H5 or H7 automatically is called a ''highly pathogenic'' strain, but live chicken pathogenicity testing can later find the virus to be nonpathogenic in chickens (eg, 2003 Texas H5N2 outbreak). Further information on avian influenza can be obtained at http://www.oie.org and http://www.cdc.gov.",

Some families of viruses that have been discovered in mammals have not been associated with disease in birds. It is imperative to perform a necropsy on any birds that die-whether a pet, aviary, or display bird, and despite the fact that other diseases may be present-because viruses can occur concurrently, especially when immunosuppression is present. Also, it is imperative to use available vaccines to decrease and control the incidence of these diseases, as has occurred in the canine and feline pet populations.",
