            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a progressive, fatal, predominantly Arthus-type immune-mediated disease that is triggered when cats are infected with a mutant enteric coronavirus. The disease presents variably with multiple organ failure, seizures, generalized effusion, or shock. Neurological FIP is clinically and pathologically more homogeneous than systemic 'wet' or 'dry' FIP; thus, comparison of cytokine profiles from cats with neurological FIP, wet FIP, and non-FIP neurological disease may provide insight into some baseline characteristics relating to the immunopathogenesis of neurological FIP. This study characterizes inflammation and changes in cytokines in the brain tissue of FIP-affected cats. Cellular infiltrates in cats with FIP included lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. IL-1 , IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, TNF-, macrophage inhibitory protein (MIP)-1 , and RANTES showed no upregulation in the brains of control cats, moderate upregulation in neurological FIP cats, and very high upregulation in generalized FIP cats. Transcription of IFN-appeared upregulated in cats with systemic FIP and slightly downregulated in neurological FIP. In most cytokines tested, variance was extremely high in generalized FIP and much less in neurological FIP. Principal components analysis was performed in order to find the least number of 'components' that would summarize the cytokine profiles in cats with neurological FIP. A large component of the variance (91.7%) was accounted for by levels of IL-6, MIP-1 , and RANTES. These findings provide new insight into the immunopathogenesis of FIP and suggest targets for immune therapy of this disease.",

Neurological FIP occurs in about 1/3 of the cats with FIP (Fenner 1991 , Kline et al 1994 , and presents with weight loss, fever, ataxia, dementia, and other abnormal neurological signs (Kornegay 1978 , August 1984 , Kline et al 1994 . Neurological FIP consists of meningitis, ependymitis, periventriculitis, and choroiditis, sometimes leading to obstructive hydrocephalus (Slauson and Finn 1972 , Krum et al 1975 , Legendre and Whitenack 1975 , Kornegay 1978 , Tamke et al 1988 , Summers et al 1995 . Often there is little coronavirus present in FIP-affected brain tissue , yet inflammatory cells are recruited to the brain and contribute to disease, in part, through secretion of cytokines. Little is known about cytokine secretion in FIP, although preliminary studies have described increases in IL-10 (Dean et al 1997) , IL-6 and IL-1 (Goitsuka et al 1990) , and IL-1 (Hasegawa and Hasegawa 1991) , and reductions in IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 (Gunn-Moore et al 1998) in generalized FIP. No information is available regarding cytokine production in neurological FIP and how cytokines compare, in this tissue, with abdominal tissues of cats with generalized or effusive FIP. The purpose of this study was to compare cytokines in the brains of FIP-affected cats with that in the brains of control cats (well cats and cats with neuropathies not attributable to coronavirus).",

The primer and probe sequences for newly described feline real-time TaqMan RT-PCR systems are described in Table 2. PCR reactions contained 400 nM of each primer, 80 nM of the TaqMan probe and mastermix (TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix, Applied Biosystems), and 5 \u00b5l of the diluted cDNA sample in a final volume of 25 \u00b5l; samples were amplified in a combined thermocycler/fluorometer (ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems) for 2 min at 50\u00b0C, 10 min at 95\u00b0C, and then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 60 s at 60\u00b0C. Final quantitation was done using the comparative C T method and is reported as relative transcription or the n-fold difference relative to a calibrator cDNA (ie the lowest level of cytokine transcription in brain tissue from a well-cat control).",

A Wilcox signed rank test was used to compare clinical scores and Mann-Whitney U-test to compare FECV titers. The t-tests were used to compare the means of transcription of coronavirus RNA, serum protein, and serum globulins in cats with neurological vs generalized FIP. Cytokine levels among groups were compared by single-factor ANOVA. Prior to this analysis, within-cat variance was assessed to ensure that it was appropriate to pool tissue for cytokine analysis. Three to four duplicate sections of the CNS of six cats, three with systemic FIP and three with neurological FIP, were separately extracted and evaluated for cytokine mRNA by PCR. Within-cat variance was compared with between-cat variance to determine whether it was valid to lump samples from within a cat. Results of the ANOVA indicated statistical significance for all cytokines except IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-, indicating that levels of the other cytokines from multiple sections from a single cat were much more similar to each other than to sections from other cats. The P-values were 0.02 for IL-1 , 0.03 for IL-6, 0.01 for IFN-, 0.007 for TNF-, 0.05 for MIP-1 , and 0.002 for RANTES. Further analysis consisted of principal components analysis (PCA), in order to identify major contributory cytokines in the profiles. This method recharacterizes variables into several principal components (PC) that maximally account for variance in the variables. The loadings give the relative strengths and orientations of the variables to the first several important PCs. In other words, the first PC is an axis that goes through the centroid (of the data cloud) in such a way so as to minimize the average square distance of the points from the axis. The second PC also goes through the centroid, through the maximum variation in the data, but must be completely uncorrelated with PC1. Results of statistical tests were considered significant if the probability of obtaining the observed results by chance alone was %0.05. ",

Cats with neurological FIP had increased cytokine levels, compared with well-cat controls, in all cytokines evaluated except IFN-; IFN-levels in cats with neurological FIP tended to be lower than even that for well cats, but this difference was not statistically significant (P\u03ed 0.3).

However, compared with previously used techniques for evaluating coronavirus directly (virus culture, traditional RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical staining), the TaqMan RT-PCR assay is extremely sensitive.

Interestingly, of the cats tested, cats with no detectable coronaviral cDNA had the highest titers (6400). This could reflect localization of coronavirus RNA or a primarily immunemediated disease initiated by the presence of coronavirus but operating autonomously with undetectably low levels of virus. It is unlikely to have been due to antigen-antibody binding because the virus would still be available for PCR. Mouse models of FIP help clarify the significance of ongoing immune-mediated processes in these diseases. In MHV-JHM in mice, CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells contribute to viral clearance, but B-cell products contribute to demyelination; thus SCID mice (which cannot eliminate virus or make antibodies) have very high viral load but no lesions in the face of low or undetectable antibodies (Houtman and Fleming 1996) . Antibodies have been reported to exacerbate clinical FIP (Weiss and Scott 1981 , Vennema et al 1990 , Hohdatsu et al 1991 .

Only two components were necessary to capture almost entire observed variance. Unfortunately, because of the way cases were made available by client request for euthanasia, it was not possible to match controls one to one to cases on such possible sources of variance as age, home quality, concurrent disease, and other factors. A few studies have evaluated changes in cytokine levels directly attributable to age. Using a murine scald injury model, splenocyte production of both IL-4 and IL-10 increased with age, while there were no changes in IFN-or IL-12, and IL-2 production decreased (Plackett et al 2003) ; however, after injury, there was a decrease in all of the cytokines examined, regardless of age. In neonatal foals, there were no changes during the first 4 weeks of life in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cytokine expression of IL-1 , IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, or TNF- (Boyd et al 2003) . The cytokines IFN-, TGF-1, and IL-1 increased significantly with age. These studies documented unpredictable changes in cytokine levels across species and disease models with age. In the present study, there were no significant differences among the groups with respect to age. In fact, the tendency (although not statistically significant) was for cats with neurological FIP to be a little older than cats with systemic FIP, and one major difference between these groups was that neurological FIP had lower IFN-levels, a cytokine reported not to decrease with age in Plackett et al (2003) and to increase with age in Boyd et al (2003) . More importantly, in this study, cytokine variability in the systemic FIP group was very high, even though the variance in age was lower for this group than any other group except the well-cat control.",

IL-1 , which is secreted by many immune-active cells, also leads to local tissue destruction, promotes leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium, and is pyrogenic. IL-6 recruits and activates T-cells and macrophages, expands cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, modulates plasma cell differentiation, increases vascular permeability, downregulates acute phase proteins, and contributes to immune-mediated destruction in the CNS (Akira et al 1993 , Lotz 1995 , Tilg et al 1997 , Samoilova et al 1998 .

MIP-1 , or macrophage inflammatory protein, is a chemokine in the conserved C-C family of chemokines (Davatelis et al 1988) . It is secreted by macrophages, neutrophils, inflammatory fibroblasts, astrocytes, and lymphocytes, and chemoattractant primarily not only for macrophages and monocytes but also for T-cells and eosinophils. It is pyrogenic and a potentiator of IFNproduction. However, increases in IFN-were not detected in the present study. RANTES is a T-cell secreted chemokine that attracts memory T-cells, dendritic cells, NK cells, eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages. It promotes tissue infiltration of these cells, activates adhesion molecules, and represents one of the more common chemokines to be upregulated in immune-mediated diseases.",

Previously reported increases in IL-10 (Dean et al 1997) were not observed in the present study. The contribution of cell-mediated immunity to FIP is probably mixed: it may be important for early containment of FECV and FIPV but is not effective in late FIP. Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes probably exacerbate lesion formation. In MHV, CD4 + cells protect mice from encephalomyelitis and are important in viral clearance but CD4-knockout mice had less inflammation and demyelination than intact genotypes (Lane et al 2000) . CD4 + cells have been described as components of FIP granulomas (Paltrinieri et al 1998) . The chronic inflammation and apparent failure to downregulate inflammation could be due to the absent (IL-12) or weak (IL-18) responses in cats with FIP. The low-grade IL-12 and IL-18 responses also help account for the lack of IFN-upregulation. In experimental FIP, apoptosis and T-cell depletion have been noted in the spleen and mesenteric nodes, apparently mediated by cytokines (Haagmans et al 1996) . The apoptosis is mediated by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and not only serves to reduce virus load (Shibata et al 1994) but also reduces inflammation (Schmied et al 1993) . CD8 + cells against coronaviral antigens contributed to chronic demyelination and exacerbated the lesions via direct damage in MHV (Perlman et al 1987 , Castro et al 1994 .",

This very important finding may be a key to understanding why some cats succumb to FIP, if they are incapable for producing adequate IFNor fail to do so for whatever reason. IFN-has many possible effects, including direct anti-viral properties, inducing MHC class I expression, increasing superoxide dismutase, protecting against oxygen radicals, and increasing cytotoxicity of other cells. IFN-is important for clearance of MHV (Parra et al 1999) , and IFN--knockout mice are particularly susceptible to granulomatous peritonitis if they are naturally infected with MHV (France et al 1999) . Treatment with anti-IFN-antibody increased mortality in mice with MHV-JHM, while therapy with IFN-reduced mortality and virus load (Smith et al 1991) . IFN--knockout mice had higher viral loads (in liver) than mice with intact IFN-expression and more severe lesions, consisting largely of neutrophils (Kyuwa et al 1998) . Results using IFN-in FIP in cats have not been highly successful but there have not been large-scale, well-controlled clinical trials (eg Mochizuki et al 1994) . The three most likely reasons for poor success might be that (1) the more widely available product is a human recombinant IFN-, with possibly different effects and the one that cats may make antibodies to; (2) the dysregulated cytokine pattern may vary enough among cats with FIP that a more targeted, cat-specific approach may be needed; and (3) it may be difficult (or impossible) to achieve sufficient levels of the cytokine in the appropriate tissue. For example, administration of recombinant IFN-to mice with MHV-JHM resulted in reduced virus levels in the liver, but not in the brain (Smith et al 1991) .",

Because neurological FIP appears remarkably immunologically homogeneous (in contrast with systemic FIP), it seems possible that immune therapy might ultimately be designed for this syndrome, which could create a balance of cytokines that might allow a cat to eliminate virus without developing extensive immune-mediated lesions. The information presented in this paper contributes to the understanding of major aspects of the immune dysregulation that occurs in FIP. Future work obviously needs to contrast more generalized cytokine changes in cats with generalized FIP, and evaluate the ability to change cytokine levels in the CNS and also evaluate whether cytokine changes following experimental manipulation result in a better prognosis for cats with FIP.",
