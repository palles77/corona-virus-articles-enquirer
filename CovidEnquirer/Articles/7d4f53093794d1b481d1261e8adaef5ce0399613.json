RNA silencing is a mechanism in which small RNAs block gene expression by targeting homologous mRNAs without impacting nuclear DNA. Andrew Hamilton and David Baulcombe first showed that short antisense RNAs of 20-25 nt which share homology with target mRNAs are produced in silenced tissues. Since 1999 additional short RNAs have been identified, including microRNAs and siRNAs, which target homologous RNA sequences either for sequence specific degradation or, in some instances, function to repress mRNA translation.",

Since most RNA viruses form doublestranded RNA replication intermediates, replicating viruses often trigger PTGS, which subsequently degrades all homologous RNAs within the cell. This has led researchers to suggest that PTGS may have originally evolved as an antiviral defense mechanism. The ability of PTGS to target viral RNAs for degradation was demonstrated in the early 1990s when transgenic plants expressing untranslatable transcripts of the viral coat protein or replicase gene were found to be resistant to infection by the homologous virus while remaining susceptible to unrelated viruses. Virus resistance was also reported in experiments using transgenic plants which failed to accumulate detectable levels of the transgenically expressed coat protein RNA.",

A set of transgenic tobacco plants expressing a nontranslatable tobacco etch virus (TEV) coat protein RNA were initially susceptible to virus infection but then recovered and became highly resistant to secondary inoculation. Viral RNA was undetectable and transgene RNAs showed lower steady-state level accumulation in recovered leaves indicating that an RNA degradation mechanism was triggered. Contemporary studies by Rob Goldbach's laboratory showed that nontranslatable transcripts for the tomato spotted wilt virus N proteinprotected transgenic plants from infection by the virus. The idea that viruses trigger a cellular antiviral defense pathway which degrades homologous RNAs was further supported by experiments in the laboratory of David Baulcombe showing that recovery can occur during infection of nontransgenic tobacco plants. Nicotiana clevelandii inoculated with the nepovirus tomato black ring virus (TBRV) strain W22 initially showed clear virus symptoms but later recovered. Plants were resistant to secondary inoculation with the same W22 strain but were susceptible to inoculation with the heterologous nepovirus, tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), and showed partial protection to secondary infection with the TBRV strain BUK. Insertion of a fragment of the TBRV genome into the potato virus X (PVX) genome was sufficient to block infection of PVX in recovered plants indicating that plants contain an inducible sequence-specific degradation mechanism that may be a component of the plant immune response to RNA virus infection.",

            "text": "Viral-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in transgenic plants can result in methylation of the cognate transgene or nuclear gene. It has been suggested that de novo DNA methylation triggered by transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) or PTGS is driven by siRNAs imported into the nucleus, which recruit DNA methyltransferases to similar target sequences. Thus, RNA viruses, such as PVX or tobacco rattle virus (TRV), have been engineered as vectors used for knocking out host gene expression. These are termed VIGS vectors. Entire genes or fragments of genes can be inserted into the viral vector and following inoculation, induce silencing of the cognate endogenous gene. One of the earliest examples of VIGS targeting an endogenous gene was insertion of the phytoene desaturase gene (PDS) into PVX. PDS is involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and affects plants' susceptibility to photobleaching. Virus-induced PDS silencing causes leaves to lose all green color and bleach white under normal lighting conditions. The most popular research tools to study TGS and PTGS are transgenic plants expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and PVX or TRV vectors containing fragments of the GFP coding sequence. GFP expression can be monitored using a UV lamp and over time GFP expression disappears throughout the entire plant. In 1997, Olivier Voinnet and David Baulcombe first reported GFP-transgene silencing by an RNA virus and also demonstrated the silencing signal can spread systemically to suppress gene expression in distal regions. Thus, the use of VIGS to suppress expression of endogenous genes has become an important tool for analysis of gene function.",

Single-stranded RNAs are made double stranded by cellular RDRs and then are cleaved by DICER to produce siRNAs. HEN1 encodes a methyltransferase which acts alongside the DCL proteins to methylate the 3 0 -terminal nt protecting siRNAs from degradation. siRNAs then guide sequence-specific RNAinduced silencing complexes (RISCs) to target sequences for degradation. The RISC is comprised of several proteins including ARGONAUTE (AGO), which bind siRNAs or target sequences. RDR proteins use the siRNAs as primers for synthesis of dsRNAs from target viral RNAs. Arabidopsis encodes three RDR genes named RDR1, RDR2, and RDR6. RDR1 is salicylic acid inducible. Arabidopsis plants showing defects in RDR1 show increase susceptibility to TMV and TRV. RDR6 is also known as SDE1 or SGS2 and is required for transgene-generated short RNAs. SDE5 is a factor recently identified which acts with RDR6 to generate dsRNAs. SDE5 may function in the nuclear transport of dsRNAs produced by RDR6. Mutant plants deficient in RDR6 show increased susceptibility to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) but not to other viruses.",

A model of transitive RNA silencing was proposed by Voinnet and colleagues in 2003 in which dsRNAs are synthesized de novo by RDR6, which are then cleaved by DICER to generate the second generation of 21 nt siRNAs. Cycles of siRNA propagation and movement into neighboring tissues lead to general silencing throughout surrounding tissues.

At least 23 miRNAs have been identified in EBVinfected lymphocytes, many of which map to the BART gene. All BART gene miRNAs accumulate mainly during latency suggesting that they likely play a role in this stage of infection. KSHV is also associated with lymphomas and 12 miRNAs have been identified in latent infected cells. For KSHV a different set of miRNAs are seen during lytic infection suggesting that specific miRNAs are expressed during different stages of the viral life cycle. Viral-encoded miRNAs function to regulate viral gene expression and to downregulate host transcription. Since many of the herpesviral miRNAs associate with latency, they likely play a role in enabling the virus to evade the host immune system for many years.

Many silencing suppressors bind dsRNA, siRNAs, and miRNAs. The potyvirus HC-Pro blocks the RISC from acting on target RNAs ( Figure 1 ). HC-Pro was the first identified suppressor of RNA silencing in plants and was discovered by researchers studying viral synergistic diseases. Synergism is a phenomenon in which one virus shows increased titer and symptom induction due to the presence of a second but unrelated virus. Many, but not all, examples of synergy involve co-infection in which one of the viral partners is a potyvirus. Building on the early studies of PVX/PVY synergy, Vicki Vance, James Carrington, and their colleagues carried out further investigations of PVX/PVY synergy at the molecular level. They examined virus-specific RNA production in doubly infected plants and used PVX-derived vectors and transgenic plants to express segments of PVY and other potyviral genomes. Transgenic plants expressing the potyviral P1/HC-Pro sequence developed the same synergistic response when inoculated with unrelated viruses such as PVX, TMV, and CMV. P1/HC-Pro silencing suppression was demonstrated by crossing the transgenic plants with transgenic plants that were silencing for the GUS gene. The progeny lines showed restored GUS expression indicating that P1/HC-Pro suppressed transgene silencing. In a second set of experiments the GFP transgene was silencing by PVX vector containing GFP. When P1/HC-Pro was added, GFP expression was restored. Contemporaneously with this work, it was shown that CMV is also able to counteract RNA silencing and that this is mediated by the CMV 2b protein.",

In some cases, for example where the mode of action of a silencing suppressor is to bind dsRNAs in a relatively nonsize selective manner, such as the TCV CP or the aureusvirus P14 protein, there would be a greater potential for cross-inhibition between the two pathways. In cases where the silencing suppressor acts by size-selective RNA binding, or can bind selectively to protein components of the silencing pathways (e.g., binding only to specific members of the AGO or DCL protein families), there is the possibility that silencing suppressors discriminate between components of the two RNA silencing pathways (Figure 1) . Speculatively, this ability to discriminate suggests the possibility that natural selection operates on the genes for silencing suppressor to produce factors that minimize damage to host plants, or produce developmental changes that in some way favor the replication, spread, or transmission of the virus.",

Knockdown of Dicer and Drosha in HIV-1 infected cells showed that these two RNAse III enzymes contribute to suppression of HIV-1 infection. Microarray experiments identified miR-NAs that were upregulated or induced only in HIV-1 infected cells. miR-17/92 is a polycistronic miRNA cluster which is downregulated during HIV-1 replication. miR-17/92 cluster includes miR17-5p and miR20a which target the histone acetylase PCAF, a cofactor for Tat in HIV-1. Thus, the miRNAs do not target HIV-1 but cellular factors necessary for HIV-1 gene expression. Thus, HIV-1 suppression of miR-17/92 cluster ensures a necessary supply of PCAF for virus replication.",

(2006) Four plant Dicers mediate viral small RNA biogenesis and DNA virus induced silencing. Nucleic Acids Research 34(21): 6233-6246. Doublestranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are produced either by hairpin interactions or by viral and host RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which synthesize complementary RNAs using viral RNA (vRNA) or mRNA templates. Dicer or Dicer-like proteins cleave the dsRNAs to smaller miRNAs or siRNAs which then guide the RISC complex to the target RNAs. Target RNAs are cleaved into short RNAs which can interact with the RISC complex to continue the cycle of cell autonomous RNA degradation. Some siRNAs are diverted prior to the RISC complex and move cell-to-cell and long distance to perpetuate silencing in surrounding and distal tissues. Examples of viral silencing suppressors are identified in red which block silencing by acting on the siRNAs or RISC complex.",
