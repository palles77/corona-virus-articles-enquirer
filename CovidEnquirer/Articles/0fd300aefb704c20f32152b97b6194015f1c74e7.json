As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.",

The examples used were the Diamond Princess Cruise and Wuhan prior to January 20 th when the diagnosis kit was not sufficiently available. In this scenario, \u03b2 was estimated by Monte carlo approximation of the number of cases at the end of the targeted time period. Secondly, the number of Q is made available each day for the examples and the number of confirmed cases in China after January 20 th . In this scenario, \u03b3 was first determined from clinical reports for the targeted time period, and then \u03b2 was estimated by minimizing the mean squared errors from 1,000 Monte carlo samples that approximated the Q curve.",

It is believed that an enclosed and crowded environment is favorable for coronavirus transmission, however the epidemiological data is lacking. To test the hypothesis, the recent Diamond Princess cruise epidemic was used as a comparable case study. A clear disease outbreak was reported on this cruise. A passenger, who visited China on January 10 th , was on board from January 20 th and January 25 th before being confirmed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. All people on board have been quarantined at sea since February 5 th and 621 out of 3711 people were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. As some of the patients were known to be infected after the quarantine, possibly due to central air conditioning and family infection, only the confirmed cases (n=135) by February 10 th (five days incubation plus one day diagnosis) were used for a conservative estimation of transmission. Using a SEIQ model while Q=0, the daily transmission rate, \u03b2, was found to be 1.04 (95% CI 0.69-1.87) ( Figure 1B ), which is twice as much as the transmission rate in open cities. Using the infection period of 12.5 days, the effective reproductive number on the cruise, Rc, was 13.0 (95% CI 8.63-23.375).",

The first SARS-CoV-2 onset was found on December 1 st 2019 (Huang et al., 2020) , and by the 1 st of January, 41 patients were confirmed and quarantined. Using the 5.8-day interval between disease onset and clinical visit, 136 cases diagnosed in the first 6 days of January were included, bringing the total number of infections to 177. Given \u03b20=0.44, the development of the epidemic was simulated by initializing with a range of numbers (from 1 to 5) of infections on December 1 st using the SEIQ model. It showed that at most one infected patient can be allowed in the model, which induced a mean of 174 infections (95% CI 161-187) by January 1 st . Instead of one, if two unrelated people were infected by December 1 st , the 95% CI would be (291, 318) on January 1 st , significantly larger than the expected 177 cases. Thus, the transmission would be so minimal that it would not substantially contribute to the final number of infections, even if there existed a second zoonotic source. In the same sense, the results did not support a continuous zoonotic source within the Huanan Seafood Market, which would have resulted in a higher overall number of infections in the later trajectory.",
