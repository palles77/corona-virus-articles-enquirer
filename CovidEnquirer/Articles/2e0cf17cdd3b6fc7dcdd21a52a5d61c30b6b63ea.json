            "text": "Lactococcus lactis has previously been proposed as a vaccine platform for the safe delivery of heterologous antigens. Here we utilized L. lactis as a live vector for expression of listeriolysin O (LLO), a major Listeria monocytogenes antigen and virulence factor. A variety of plasmid constructs were designed to permit either constitutive or nisin-inducible expression of secreted or non-secreted LLO in L. lactis. Recombinant strains were subsequently tested in a murine model for vaccination efficacy against L. monocytogenes infection. CD8 + T lymphocytes specific for the LLO 91-99 epitope were detected when strains were administered via the intraperitoneal (IP) but not the oral route. Challenge with live L. monocytogenes revealed different levels of protection among the three vaccine strains tested with the nisin-inducible LLO-secreting L. lactis strain providing the greatest protection against secondary infection. This work highlights the usefulness of the GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) organism L. lactis as the basis of a live vaccine vector against L. monocytogenes. The work suggests that LLO-expressing L. lactis strains may also have the potential to act as a platform for directing other co-expressed antigens towards the cytosolic MHC class I pathway for enhanced stimulation of the CD8 + T-cell response.",

Pregnant women are particularly susceptible, developing flu-like symptoms followed by chorioamnionitis and miscarriage [1] . Although L. monocytogenes infections are generally sporadic in the community, several large-scale common-source outbreaks have occurred worldwide [2] . Once listeriosis is established in an infected host the mortality rate is high (20-30%) , and in terms of human mortality L. monocytogenes is considered to be among the most significant bacterial causes of food-borne diseases [3] . Moreover, L. monocytogenes also causes infections of cattle and sheep and can result in appreciable losses through foetal infection and spontaneous abortions in these animals. Infection of farm animals is also considered to pose a zoonotic threat to humans who may be exposed to L. monocytogenes through contaminated milk or meat products [4] .",

            "text": "L. monocytogenes is an intracellular pathogen which has a unique mechanism of cellular infection. Upon phagocytosis, the pathogen secretes a hemolysin, listeriolysin O (LLO), that forms pores in the phagosomal membrane enabling the bacterium to access the host cell cytoplasm [3] . Through the expression of other specific virulence factors (including ActA, Hpt, and PlcB), L. monocytogenes replicates and moves within the cytosol and can spread from cell to cell without exposure to the extracellular milieu [5] . Investigation of the immune response against L. monocytogenes showed that in addition to its role in intracellular pathogenesis, LLO is a major immunodominant listerial antigen. Indeed protective immunity against L. monocytogenes is dependent on cytotoxic CD8 + cell-mediated immunity against epitopes of the two major virulence factors LLO and P60 [6] . The central role of LLO in the listerial infection cycle, coupled to the significant antigenicity of this protein indicates that LLO may have potential as the basis of a vaccine against L. monocytogenes. Live bacterial vectors such as attenuated Bacillus anthracis and aroA \u2212 Salmonella typhimurium strains have previously been engineered to express LLO for vaccination against L. monocytogenes [7] [8] [9] . In addition, several attenuated L. monocytogenes mutants have been investigated as possible vaccines against listeriosis or as heterologous antigen delivery systems for vaccination against cancer and [42] Lactococcus lactis subspecies cremoris MG1363 Plasmid free Lactococcus strain [66] L. lactis NZ9700 Nisin producer strain [29] L. lactis NZ9000 L. lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 carrying nisRK on the chromosome [29] L. lactis NZ9000 htrA L. lactis NZ9000 with a chromosomal deletion in the htrA promoter and the 5 -end region of htrA [32] pQE30",

However, although the efficacy of these approaches was clearly demonstrated, all the abovementioned vectors are based upon live attenuated pathogens which may have the potential for reversion to a virulent state. Lactococcus lactis is a GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) microorganism that is widely used in the food industry. The development of numerous inducible and constitutive expression systems for L. lactis has enhanced the use of this organism as a cellular factory for expression of various heterologous proteins of biotechnological interest [14] . This work has extended into the use of L. lactis as a live vaccine vector for delivery of heterologous antigens. Several antigens such as tetanus toxin fragment C (TTFC) [15] , Helicobacter pylori Cag12 antigen [16] , Giardia lamblia cyst wall protein 2 [17] , and SARS-coronavirus nucleocapsid protein [18] have been successfully expressed in L. lactis with promising immunological outcomes following administration in mice. Moreover, L. lactis has also been used as a vehicle for delivery of therapeutic bioactive substances (including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and trefoil factors) to reduce inflammation and enhance recovery in murine models of colitis [19, 20] . Indeed, an L. lactis strain expressing human IL-10 and utilizing a novel biological containment strategy has recently been the subject of clinical trials in patients with Crohn's disease [19] . Since L. lactis is a non-pathogenic, non-invasive and noncommensal food-grade bacterium, it is particularly attractive as a basis for safe delivery of antigens or bioactive molecules. Furthermore, the Gram-positive bacterium L. lactis has a relatively small genome size with few exoproteins and unlike proposed Gramnegative hosts, does not produce endotoxin [21] [22] [23] .",

LLO was expressed in an active form in all cases except the constitutive intracellular form. Investigation of the immune response upon vaccination of BALB/c mice via the intraperitoneal (IP) and oral routes revealed different levels of LLO-specific CD8 + T cells, IgG antibodies and protection against challenge with L. monocytogenes.

To achieve this we eliminated the PnisA promoter (along with the NcoI site) from pNZ8048 by enzymatic digestion (BglII and KpnI) and replaced it with our promoter (PnisA or P44)/insert constructs without the need for NcoI digestion (Fig. 1) .

Mice were therefore challenged intraperitoneally with luminescent L. monocytogenes 3 days after the final vaccine booster to mimic the systemic phase of infection. Three days following challenge mice were euthanized and luminescence of individual organs was measured using the Xenogen IVIS100 machine (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) followed by plating and determination of the Listeria counts in livers and spleens. Bacterial count results following IP vaccination revealed significant protection as evidenced by the low listerial count in spleens and livers of mice vaccinated with either of the three LLO-producing strains (Fig. 5) . On the contrary, strong luminescence and high listerial counts were observed in organs of the non-treated groups or groups treated with the control strain L. lactis NZ9000. However, it was found that mice treated with control strain L. lactis NZ9000 showed significantly lower listerial organ counts (P < 0.05) than the non-treated mice, indicating non-specific immune protection against L. monocytogenes by the L. lactis strain Fig. 5 .

Moreover, we assumed that the rapid death of Lactococcus due to gastric acidity (as suggested by our in vitro observations; data not shown) might be a major cause of vaccine failure when given orally. Therefore, we repeated the oral vaccination with the final inoculum resuspended in GM17 broth pH 8.5 (adjusted with 50 mM CO 3 2\u2212 of sodium bicarbonate) [46] . The L. lactis NZ9000 htrA (pNZPnisA:SEC-LLO) strain was given by the oral or IP routes using the previously described vaccination regimens and the ELISPOT test, serum IgG1 and IgG2a titres and challenge test were performed 6 weeks after the last booster. LLO 91-99 -specific CD8 + lymphocytes were detected following the IP but not the oral (pH 8.5) vaccination regimen (Fig. 6) . Similarly both statistically significant IgG1 and IgG2a titres were detected following administration of the IP but not the oral vaccine (Fig. 6) . Finally, challenge experiments confirmed the protective efficacy of the injected L. lactis NZ9000 htrA (pNZPnisA:SEC-LLO) strain (Fig. 7) . No difference in listerial organ count was observed between the group treated with control L. lactis NZ9000 htrA and the non-treated group which indicates the lack of non-specific immune stimulation at 6 weeks post-vaccination (Fig. 7) . Representative organ luminescence pictures of the challenge experiment are shown in Fig. 7 . It is noteworthy that we found the sensitivity of luminescence detection is limited to about 10 5 CFU/organ below which no luminescence could be measured. This finding confined the use of the luminescence data to qualitative rather than quantitative comparisons in both the short-and long-term challenge experiments. These results confirm that IP inoculation confers longer term protection (6 weeks after last booster) and specific immunity (antibodies and cytotoxic CD8 + cells). Moreover, it is shown that oral inoculation at pH 8.5 did not promote vaccine efficacy and suggests that other gastrointestinal conditions (e.g. the presence of bile) may contribute to the reduced viability of Lactococcus during gastrointestinal transit [47] .",

In our model L. lactis was incapable of growth in J774 cells, as evidenced by experimental bacterial counts, irrespective of LLO expression. This contrasted significantly with the L. monocytogenes control which increased in numbers over time. Listeriolysin O is essential for the escape of L. monocytogenes from the macrophage phagosome to the cytoplasmic compartment [3] . It has been shown previously that an engineered LLO-secreting Bacillus subtilis strain can escape from the phagosomal compartment and grow in the J774 cell cytosol [49] . In contrast, Goetz et al. utilized microinjection to introduce a variety of bacteria directly into the cytoplasm of Caco-2 cells and found that bacteria that are not adapted to the cytoplasmic compartment are unable to multiply and grow [50] . Our work supports the latter findings and suggests that L. lactis vaccine vectors engineered to access the cytoplasmic antigen presenting pathway are incapable of further growth in this environment. Unlike L. monocytogenes, Lactococcus is not adapted to multiply and persist inside macrophages and does not possess the molecular factors that enable survival in the host cytosol [51] . It is noteworthy that LLO is rapidly inactivated once in the cytosol of infected cells and does not display toxicity towards the host cytoplasmic membrane [52] . We hypothesized that LLO-expressing L. lactis strains will access the cytoplasmic MHC class I antigen presenting pathway in antigen presenting cells and deliver LLO, an antigen previously determined to provide protective immunity against L. monocytogenes [6] .",

Although significant antibody titres were elicited by two of the vaccine strains (Figs. 4 and 6), the results of the challenge test suggested that the CD8 + response was more important for protection. Significantly another study found that CD8 + T cells (and not antibodies or CD4 + cells) are the major mediators of immunity against Listeria when LLO was delivered by an attenuated B. anthracis strain [9] . Our data also suggest that future L. lactis vectors expressing LLO combined with other heterologous antigens may be useful in eliciting antibody-mediated as well as cell-mediated immune responses.",

However, all engineered L. lactis strains provided protective immunity against secondary challenge with L. monocytogenes. It is clear in the literature that robust CD8 + T-cell responses are required for immunity to L. monocytogenes [6] .

In addition, it is reported in the literature that secreted LLO is more immunogenic than the non-secreted form [7] . We utilized this strain in longer term vaccination studies and analyzed protective immune responses 6 weeks following the final booster inoculation. These studies demonstrated that this vaccine vector was capable of inducing specific protection against subsequent L. monocytogenes infection. The vector was not capable of inducing immunity to the same level as exposure to sub-lethal L. monocytogenes positive control. This is most likely due to the fact that the current L. lactis vectors express only a single L. monocytogenes antigen (i.e. LLO). Previous studies utilizing Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing both LLO and P60 listerial antigens showed enhanced protection against listeriosis when compared to vectors expressing single antigens [55] .",

However, the viability of Lactococcus is well-known to be greatly diminished in the gastrointestinal tract [56] , thus LLO production and presentation to the immune system is expected to be reduced in this environment. We attempted to maximize the oral dose of Lactococcus, buffer the vaccine inocula to pH 8.5 and increase the number of vaccination doses to compensate for that loss. A similar approach was used by other investigators [54, 57, 58] who used seven to nine oral doses with various vaccination regimens. However, in the present study we did not obtain significant protection against L. monocytogenes following oral vaccination. The reason for this may be the wellreported rapid killing of L. lactis in the gut [56, 59] , the vaccination regimen used, the nature of the expressed antigen itself or a combination of all these factors. Further studies and strategies to improve vaccine efficacy via the oral route are ongoing in our laboratory.",
